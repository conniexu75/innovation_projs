In this study, we characterize Drosophila small RNAs that derive from short intronic hairpins termed “mirtrons.” Their nuclear biogenesis appears to bypass Drosha cleavage, which is essential for miRNA biogenesis. Instead, mirtron hairpins are defined by the action of the splicing machinery and lariat-debranching enzyme, which yield pre-miRNA-like hairpins. The mirtron pathway merges with the canonical miRNA pathway during hairpin export by Exportin-5, and both types of hairpins are subsequently processed by Dicer-1/loqs. This generates small RNAs that can repress perfectly matched and seed-matched targets, and we provide evidence that they function, at least in part, via the RNA-induced silencing complex effector Ago1. These findings reveal that mirtrons are an alternate source of miRNA-type regulatory RNAs.

However, it was not until late 2001 that miRNA genes were appreciated to be an abundant feature of eukaryotic genomes (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T.

An extensive class of small RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans.Science. 2001; 294: 862-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of such an abundant gene class has sparked a torrent of inquiry into their biogenesis and function. miRNA loci are generally transcribed as long, primary-miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts by RNA polymerase II (Lee et al., 2004aLee Y. Kim M. Han J. Yeom K.H. Lee S. Baek S.H. Kim V.N. MicroRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4051-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (3044) Google Scholar), although some are products of RNA polymerase III (Borchert et al., 2006Borchert G.M. Lanier W. Davidson B.L. RNA polymerase III transcribes human microRNAs.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Most miRNAs derive from the exons or introns of noncoding RNAs, but about one-third are located in the introns of mRNA-encoding host genes (Rodriguez et al., 2004Rodriguez A. Griffiths-Jones S. Ashurst J.L. Bradley A. Identification of mammalian microRNA host genes and transcription units.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1902-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). pri-miRNAs contain an extended hairpin structure that is cleaved near the base by the nuclear RNase III enzyme Drosha, thereby releasing a ∼65 nucleotide (nt) pre-miRNA hairpin (Lee et al., 2003Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. The nuclear RNase III Drosha initiates microRNA processing.Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar). The pre-miRNA is then exported to the cytoplasm and cleaved near its terminal loop by the RNase III enzyme Dicer, yielding a ∼22 nt miRNA duplex (Grishok et al., 2001Grishok A. Pasquinelli A. Conte D. Li N. Parrish S. Ha I. Baillie D.L. Fire A. Ruvkun G. Mello C.C.

Dicer functions in RNA interference and in synthesis of small RNAs involved in developmental timing in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2654-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Because RNase III cleavage leaves behind a 2 nt-3′ overhang, miRNA duplexes display these signature overhangs at both ends (Figure 1). One strand of the miRNA duplex is preferentially transferred to an active effector complex containing an Argonaute (Ago) protein (reviewed by Du and Zamore, 2005Du T. Zamore P.D. microPrimer: the biogenesis and function of microRNA.Development. 2005; 132: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The other strand, referred to as the miRNA∗ species, is generally presumed to be a nonfunctional carrier strand that is degraded. The mature miRNA then guides the Ago complex to target transcripts for regulation (reviewed by Valencia-Sanchez et al., 2006Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Liu J. Hannon G.J. Parker R. Control of translation and mRNA degradation by miRNAs and siRNAs.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). Experimental and computational approaches showed that Watson-Crick base pairing between positions 2–8 from the 5′ end of an animal miRNA (the miRNA “seed”) and a target transcript is typically necessary and often sufficient for direct regulation (Brennecke et al., 2005Brennecke J.

Global miRNA target studies suggest that a majority of animal transcripts either are under detectable selective pressure to maintain direct regulation by miRNAs (Grun et al., 2005Grun D. Wang Y.-L.

Over a million Drosophila small-RNA sequences were recently generated using 454 pyrosequencing (J.G. Ruby, W. Johnston, D. Bartel, and E.C.L., unpublished data). When analyzing these sequences, the Bartel lab identified 14 short introns with predicted hairpin structure that give rise to novel ∼22 nt RNAs (Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). In recognizing their pre-miRNA and intronic features as defining characteristics, they named these introns “mirtrons.” They observed that primary-mirtron precursors composed of mirtronic introns and flanking exonic sequences lack the lower stem of pri-miRNAs (Figure 1), which mediates their recognition and cleavage by the Pasha (DGCR8)/Drosha complex (Han et al., 2006Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Nam J.W. Heo I. Rhee J.K. Sohn S.Y. Cho Y. Zhang B.T. Kim V.N. Molecular basis for the recognition of primary microRNAs by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex.Cell. 2006; 125: 887-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Instead, their hairpin ends correspond precisely to splice sites (Figure 1, Figure 2). The “AG” splice acceptor of mirtronic introns typically adopts a 2 nt-3′ overhang to these hairpins, thereby mimicking a Drosha product (Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). The processing of these hairpins was further reminiscent of Dicer substrates, since the cloned RNAs derived from mirtrons adopt duplex configurations characteristic of miRNA/miRNA∗ pairs (Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). This study reports functional evidence that mirtrons are generated by a nuclear pathway that appears to bypass Drosha but instead involves splicing and intron lariat-debranching enzyme. Debranched mirtron hairpins access the cytoplasm via Exportin-5 and enter the Dicer-1/miRNA biogenesis pathway to yield small regulatory RNAs. Although other effector complexes are not excluded, we provide evidence that mirtron-derived small RNAs associate with and require Ago1 to repress seed-matched targets. Our data support and extend the findings of Ruby, Jan, and Bartel (Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar) with regard to the fundamental properties of these novel small-RNA genes, whose existence broadens the universe of small regulatory RNAs in animals. Pre-miRNA hairpins collectively yield functional RNAs from both 5′ and 3′ hairpin arms (Figure 1). In contrast, mirtron hairpins yield predominant small RNAs from only their 3′ arms (Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). The 5′ splice consensus may intrinsically bias mirtron processing, since miRNAs and mirtron-derived small RNAs exhibit strong preferences to begin with U residues, whereas 5′ mirtron-derived RNAs must begin with a G residue (Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). In addition, mirtrons typically exhibit extensive pairing between the 5′ and 3′ splice sequences (Figure 1), a layout that may bias the selection of their 3′ arms as regulatory species (Khvorova et al., 2003Khvorova A. Reynolds A. Jayasena S.D. Functional siRNAs and miRNAs exhibit strand bias.Cell. 2003; 115: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar, Schwarz et al., 2003Schwarz D.S. Hutvagner G. Du T. Xu Z. Aronin N. Zamore P.D. Asymmetry in the assembly of the RNAi enzyme complex.Cell. 2003; 115: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). The asymmetry of mirtron processing toward 3′ products is rational from a biological perspective, since the regulatory potential of their 5′ products is perhaps undesirably constrained by the splice donor sequences within their prospective seed regions. Further support for the regulatory status of mirtrons came from the observation that several mirtronic introns are well conserved among the sequenced Drosophilids (Figures 2A and S1; Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). On the other hand, most mirtrons are preserved only within species of the melanogaster subgroup (D. melanogaster, D. simulans/sechellia, and/or D. yakuba/erecta), suggesting that they were born within the last 5–10 million years (Figures 2B and S1; Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, detailed inspection revealed that the evolution of both “old” and “young” mirtrons parallels that of miRNAs in two aspects (reviewed by Lai et al., 2003Lai E.C. Tomancak P. Williams R.W. Rubin G.M. Computational identification of Drosophila microRNA genes.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, as is the case for miRNA hairpins, both young and old mirtrons exhibit accelerated divergence in loop regions relative to the hairpin stems (Figures 2 and S1). Second, mirtron loci display preferential conservation of the 5′ seed region, a key determinant for miRNA target recognition (e.g., Figure 2A). In fact, small RNAs generated by mirtrons resident in CG6695 and CG31772 (miR-1003 and miR-1004, respectively) have the same seed (Figures 2, 6, and S2), indicative of a functional subfamily. These observations suggested that mirtrons are RNA genes related to miRNAs. Since experimental evidence presented in this study (see below) and a contemporary study (Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar) supported their identity as a functional subclass of miRNA genes, we refer to the hairpin introns as mirtrons and their small-RNA products as miRNAs. We began our functional studies by using northern analysis to ask whether processed mirtrons could be detected across development or in cultured cells. We probed total RNA from 0–24 hr embryos, third-instar larvae/pupae, adults, and S2 cells to northern analysis with γ-32P-labeled locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligos antisense to the terminal 22–24 nt of mirtron hairpins for mir-1003, mir-1010, and mir-1008. These probes detected mature ∼21–24 nt RNAs and rarer ∼55–70 nt precursors (Figure 3). As with miRNAs, such discretely hybridizing bands reflected precision in mirtron processing and argued against the possibility that the cloned sequences merely represent metabolic intermediates of spliced introns. We also note that mirtrons exhibited variety in their developmental and spatial expression profiles, similar to miRNAs. For example, the small-RNA products of mir-1003 and mir-1008, but not of mir-1010, were detected in S2 cells. mir-1010 also differed in that its expression was much reduced in adults relative to earlier stages (Figure 3). We next investigated whether mirtrons could be expressed exogenously. To do so, we cloned ∼400 nt pri-mirtron genomic fragments, whose termini lie within the exons flanking the mirtron, and inserted them into the 3′ UTR of a UAS-DsRed vector (Figure 4, construct A). This generic strategy successfully generates mature Drosophila miRNAs from similarly sized pri-miRNA fragments (Lai et al., 2005Lai E.C. Tam B. Rubin G.M. Pervasive regulation of Drosophila Notch target genes by GY-box-, Brd-box-, and K-box-class microRNAs.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, Stark et al., 2003Stark A. Brennecke J. Russell R.B. Cohen S.M. Identification of Drosophila MicroRNA Targets.PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E60Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). For these studies, we selected both highly conserved (mir-1003 and mir-1010) and newly born (mir-1008 and mir-1004) mirtron loci. When transfected into S2 cells with ub-Gal4, such constructs directed the expression of all four mirtrons and their mature small-RNA products (Figure 4, lanes 2 and 7, and data not shown). We then tested the ability of mirtrons to be processed when resident in the coding context of a designed vector. To exclude the potential contribution of specific exonic sequences to mirtron maturation, we designed a host vector in which the mirtronic intron alone is inserted into the coding region of a DsRed-myc transcript (Figure 4, construct B). We found that mature miR-1003, miR-1008, and their corresponding mirtrons were produced from such constructs at levels comparable to their expression from endogenous exonic contexts (Figure 4, lanes 3 and 8; compare with lanes 2 and 7). Therefore, the sequence of a short intron can autonomously dictate its ability to enter the mirtron pathway. The concordance between mirtron ends and splice sites (Figure 1, Figure 2) suggested that their biogenesis might bypass the essential miRNA-producing enzyme Drosha. We tested this by treating S2 cells with dsRNA against Drosha. Western blot analysis confirmed robust knockdown of Drosha protein after 4 days (Figure S2A). As a control, we tested the behavior of a UAS-DsRed-mir-1 construct; S2 cells do not normally express miR-1. As shown in Figure 5A (lanes 1 and 2), the levels of pre-miR-1 hairpin and mature miR-1 were significantly reduced in Drosha dsRNA-treated cells relative to green fluorescent protein (GFP) dsRNA-treated cells. In contrast, endogenous miR-1003 and its mirtron were not demonstrably changed by these treatments (Figure 5A, lanes 6 and 7), and the accumulation of exogenous miR-1003, miR-1010, and their associated mirtrons was also similar between GFP and Drosha-knockdown cells (Figure 5A, lanes 11 and 12 and 19 and 20). While these data do not exclude a contribution of Drosha to mirtron processing, they indicate that mirtron biogenesis does not exhibit the strong dependence on Drosha that is characteristic of canonical miRNA pathway substrates. We next tested the alternative hypothesis that splicing might directly initiate mirtron biogenesis. To do so, we made single G -> C substitutions in the 5′ splice sites of otherwise functional mir-1003 and mir-1008 mirtron-expression constructs (Figure 4, construct C). Such mutations completely abolished the accumulation of mirtron hairpins and mature ∼22 mers (Figure 4, lanes 4 and 9), indicating that both forms are obligate splicing products. Since spliced introns adopt a lariat structure in which the 5′ splice junction is covalently linked to the 3′ branch point, we hypothesized that Drosophila lariat-debranching enzyme (Ldbr) is needed for spliced mirtron lariats to adopt hairpin folds required for their subsequent cleavage by Dicer. We treated cells with Ldbr dsRNA and analyzed their ability to process endogenous mirtrons and products of UAS-DsRed-small-RNA plasmids. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated successful knockdown of Ldbr function, as evidenced by a 15-fold accumulation of the actin intron relative to cells that received GFP or Drosha dsRNA (Figure S2B). These cells exhibited only a minor decline in pre-miR-1 hairpin and mature miR-1 (Figure 5A, lane 3). In contrast, the accumulation of hairpin mirtrons and their mature products was strongly decreased or abolished by this treatment, including those of endogenous mir-1003 (Figure 5A, lane 8) and ectopic mir-1003 and mir-1010 (Figure 5A, lanes 13 and 21). We sought to confirm a positively acting role for Ldbr in mirtron production in the animal using a UAS-LdbrRNAi transgene (Conklin et al., 2005Conklin J.F. Goldman A. Lopez A.J. Stabilization and analysis of intron lariats in vivo.Methods. 2005; 37: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). When activated with da-Gal4, individuals survived well to late larval stages but died during pupation. We therefore selected late third-instar larvae as a compromise time point that was suboptimal for Ldbr knockdown but obviated secondary concerns surrounding the analysis of sickly animals. As with the S2 experiments, RNA from Ldbr knockdown larvae showed increased levels of actin intron (Figure S2B) but decreased levels of endogenous mirtron hairpin and mature product for mir-1010 (Figure 5B). When the same blots were stripped and reprobed for miR-1, we observed little change in the accumulation of this miRNA. We quantified a 67% reduction in miR-1010 as normalized to miR-1 under these conditions (Figure S3). Finally, to rule out the possibility that specific sequences in mature mirtrons per se influence their choice of nuclear processing pathway, we created a hybrid miRNA/mirtron construct in which the mature miR-1003 sequence was programmed into a pri-mir-6-1 precursor structure (Figure 4, construct D). Such a construct still produced mature miR-1003 (Figure 4, lane 5). However, the hybrid mir-6-1/mir-1003 construct now exhibited behaviors characteristic of a canonical miRNA precursor, in that its processing displayed strong dependence on Drosha but was little affected by Ldbr depletion (Figure 5A, lanes 17 and 18). Thus, we are able to control the choice of RNA substrates to enter the nuclear mirtron or miRNA pathways by manipulating sequence and structural features defined by our biogenesis experiments. Collectively, these data reveal that mirtron biogenesis, like that of certain snoRNAs (Ooi et al., 1998Ooi S.L. Samarsky D.A. Fournier M.J. Boeke J.D. Intronic snoRNA biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae depends on the lariat-debranching enzyme: intron length effects and activity of a precursor snoRNA.RNA. 1998; 4: 1096-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), positively requires the action of lariat-debranching enzyme. These data do not exclude the possibility that Ldbr is required for the activity or processing of an intermediate factor that in turn mediates the resolution of mirtrons, but they are consistent with the parsimonious explanation that Ldbr acts directly upon mirtron lariats. The recovery of paired small RNAs from mirtrons that resemble miRNA/miRNA∗ species suggested that mirtron biogenesis converges at some point with the canonical miRNA pathway (Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). We considered that this might occur during nuclear hairpin export, which is believed to be mediated by Exportin-5 (Bohnsack et al., 2004Bohnsack M.T. Czaplinski K. Gorlich D. Exportin 5 is a RanGTP-dependent dsRNA-binding protein that mediates nuclear export of pre-miRNAs.RNA. 2004; 10: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, Lund et al., 2004Lund E.

Exportin-5 mediates the nuclear export of pre-microRNAs and short hairpin RNAs.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3011-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). Functional studies of Exportin-5 knockdown are complicated since animal mutants have not been described, and only mild effects on miRNA processing can be obtained using RNAi-mediated knockdown (Lund et al., 2004Lund E. Guttinger S. Calado A. Dahlberg J.E. Kutay U. Nuclear export of microRNA precursors.Science. 2004; 303: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar, Shibata et al., 2006Shibata S. Sasaki M.

Exportin-5 orthologues are functionally divergent among species.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results in mammalian and Drosophila cells, we observed modest (∼50%) reduction in endogenous mature miR-2b upon treatment with either of two nonoverlapping Exportin-5 dsRNAs (Figure S4). However, mirtron hairpins proved to be more sensitive to manipulation of Exportin-5. We observed 60%–80% reduction in mirtron hairpins and mature products for endogenous mir-1003 and mir-1008 in cells treated with either Exportin-5 dsRNA (Figure 5C). Similar, although slightly less robust, results were obtained using UAS-DsRed-mir-1003 and UAS-DsRed-mir-1010 mirtron-expression constructs (Figure S4). It is conceivable that mirtron overexpression can partially overcome Exportin-5 knockdown or that there is an alternate mechanism for the nuclear export of pre-miRNAs and mirtrons. However, these data suggest that a considerable proportion of mirtron hairpins transit Drosophila Exportin-5. In addition, the observation that mirtron hairpins decline following Exportin-5 knockdown is consistent with the previous suggestion that nuclear pre-miRNA hairpins are degraded when Exportin-5 is compromised (Yi et al., 2003Yi R. Qin Y. Macara I.G. Cullen B.R. Exportin-5 mediates the nuclear export of pre-microRNAs and short hairpin RNAs.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3011-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). If the mirtron and canonical miRNA pathways merge during hairpin export, one might predict that their cytoplasmic processing should be similar. There are two Drosophila Dicers, with Dicer-1 known to be genetically required for pre-miRNA maturation and Dicer-2 for processing of long dsRNA (Lee et al., 2004bLee Y.S. Nakahara K. Pham J.W.

A newly developed nanowire frequency-tuneable light source described in this issue could contribute to the advance of nanophotonics, especially in bio-imaging applications, as it can function in physiological conditions and ensures a minimum of damage to the sample. Made from an inorganic material (potassium niobate) with nonlinear optical properties (so that it can convert light from one frequency to another), the light source was held steady with optical tweezers, then scanned over a test sample. The resulting images reveal the sample structure with subwavelength resolution. As well as bio-imaging, this methodology may also find use in advanced information technology, cryptography and signal processing circuits. The cover graphic illustrates a trapped nanowire scanning over dye-loaded microbeads in a liquid environment. This paper reports the development of a source of visible light based on an inorganic nanowire made from potassium niobate, which as it has nonlinear optical properties, can convert light from one frequency to another. The nanowire light source is held with optical tweezers and scanned over a sample to make images of a test structure with sub-wavelength resolution. One crucial challenge for subwavelength optics has been the development of a tunable source of coherent laser radiation for use in the physical, information and biological sciences that is stable at room temperature and physiological conditions. Current advanced near-field imaging techniques using fibre-optic scattering probes1,2 have already achieved spatial resolution down to the 20-nm range. Recently reported far-field approaches for optical microscopy, including stimulated emission depletion3, structured illumination4, and photoactivated localization microscopy5, have enabled impressive, theoretically unlimited spatial resolution of fluorescent biomolecular complexes. Previous work with laser tweezers6,7,8 has suggested that optical traps could be used to create novel spatial probes and sensors. Inorganic nanowires have diameters substantially below the wavelength of visible light and have electronic and optical properties9,10 that make them ideal for subwavelength laser and imaging technology. Here we report the development of an electrode-free, continuously tunable coherent visible light source compatible with physiological environments, from individual potassium niobate (KNbO3) nanowires. These wires exhibit efficient second harmonic generation, and act as frequency converters, allowing the local synthesis of a wide range of colours via sum and difference frequency generation. We use this tunable nanometric light source to implement a novel form of subwavelength microscopy, in which an infrared laser is used to optically trap and scan a nanowire over a sample, suggesting a wide range of potential applications in physics, chemistry, materials science and biology."

We explain the observed conductance quantization, which is fractional in the bipolar regime and an integer in the unipolar regime, in terms of quantum Hall edge modes propagating along and across the p-n interface. In the bipolar regime, the electron and hole modes can mix at the p-n boundary, leading to current partition and quantized shot-noise plateaus similar to those of conductance, whereas in the unipolar regime transport is noiseless. These quantum Hall phenomena reflect the massless Dirac character of charge carriers in graphene, with particle/hole interplay manifest in mode mixing and noise in the bipolar regime."

Here we report that FGF19 and its cognate receptor FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) are coexpressed in primary human liver, lung and colon tumors and in a subset of human colon cancer cell lines. To test the importance of FGF19 for tumor growth, we developed an anti-FGF19 monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks the interaction of FGF19 with FGFR4. This antibody abolished FGF19-mediated activity in vitro and inhibited growth of colon tumor xenografts in vivo and effectively prevented hepatocellular carcinomas in FGF19 transgenic mice. The efficacy of the antibody in these models was linked to inhibition of FGF19-dependent activation of FGFR4, FRS2, ERK and beta-catenin. These findings suggest that the inactivation of FGF19 could be beneficial for the treatment of colon cancer, liver cancer and other malignancies involving interaction of FGF19 and FGFR4."

The structures show that inhibitors bind in membrane-embedded pockets of FLAP, which suggests how these inhibitors prevent arachidonic acid from binding to FLAP and subsequently being transferred to 5-lipoxygenase, thereby preventing leukotriene biosynthesis.

Previous studies have been focused on mTORC1 to elucidate the central roles of the complex in mediating nutritional and growth factor signals to the protein synthesis machinery. Functions of mTORC2, relative to mTORC1, have remained little understood.

PRR5 interacts with rictor, but not raptor, and the interaction is independent of mTOR and not disturbed under conditions that disrupt the mTOR-rictor interaction. PRR5, unlike Sin1, another component of mTORC2, is not important for the mTOR-rictor interaction and mTOR activity toward Akt phosphorylation.

Target sequences were 5′-catgctgcaggccatcttcta-3′ (sh-PRR5 4), 5′-ggacaagattcgcttctatga-3′ (sh-PRR5 15), 5′-aaccctgcctttgtcatgcct-3′ (sh-mTOR), 5′-caccaccaaagcaacctatag-3′ (sh-rictor), and 5′-aacgtacgcggaatacttcga-3′ (scrambled shRNA). All other constructs used in the experiments have been previously described (10Kim D-H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M.

Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T, HeLa, HT1080, HepG2 cells, and other cancer cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transient expression, HEK293T cells were transfected with recombinant DNAs or shRNA plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 2 days post-transfection for co-immunoprecipitation assay. Recombinant Protein Production—GST-tagged PRR5 isoforms 1, 2, and 3 cloned in pGEX6T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (EMD Biosciences) by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to a standard protocol. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For co-immunoprecipitation studies, whole-cell extracts were prepared in 0.3% Chaps buffer and immunoprecipitated with the anti-mTOR, anti-raptor, anti-rictor, anti-PRR5, anti-HA, or anti-Myc antibodies. Precipitated proteins were washed four times in 0.3% Chaps buffer, loaded onto 8% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen), transferred for 4 h onto immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and detected with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Perkin-Elmer). Lentiviral Preparation, Viral Infection, and Stable Cell Generation—A pLKO-shRNA plasmid encoding an shRNA that targets PRR5 or a scrambled sequence was transduced into HEK293T cells with lentiviral packaging vectors pHR′8.2ΔR and pCMV-VSV-G (provided by Dr. S. Stewart, Washington University) using FuGENE 6. Viruses were collected from the medium 60 h after transfection, and target cells were infected with the collected viruses four times over 15 h in the presence of polybrene. Cells were harvested 3 to 5 days post-infection or selected under puromycin for several days. Cell Proliferation Assay—HeLa cells transduced with lentiviral shRNAs were split into 6-cm plates at 20% confluence; the next day cells were trypsinized and diluted ten times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. One ml of diluted cell culture was loaded on a ViCell analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from HeLa cells transduced by lentiviral shRNAs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit for real-time PCR (Bio-Rad) and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. PCR products were generated by PCR amplification using Lightcycler Faststart DNA Masterplus SYBR Green 1 (Bio-Rad). Amplification of human PDGFRβ cDNA was performed using a forward primer, 5′-tgtgacggagagtgtgaatgac-3′, paired with a reverse primer, 5′-agggtgcggttgtctttgaac-3′. Amplification of TATA box-binding protein cDNA was performed using a forward primer, 5′-taatcccaagcggtttgctg-3′, paired with a reverse primer, 5′-gcacaccattttcccagaactg-3′. Identification of PRR5 as an mTOR-binding Protein—In our recent study, we described an approach combining the electrospray linear ion trap mass spectrometer and mTOR immunoprecipitation to identify mTOR-binding proteins (14Vander Haar E. Lee S-I. Bandhakavi S. Griffin T.J. Kim D.-H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). This approach, without relying on SDS-PAGE separation of proteins, increased the sensitivity of detection and led us to identify PRAS40 and Sin1 that were barely detectable on Coomassie-stained gels. We modified sample preparative conditions for mass spectrometry as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” In the new preparation, we identified three peptides of high scores of P value, a parameter of fidelity for MS/MS matches, that were detected from proteins isolated specifically in mTOR immunoprecipitate but not in control immunoprecipitates (supplemental Table 1) (14Vander Haar E. Lee S-I. Bandhakavi S. Griffin T.J. Kim D.-H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). The three identified peptides were derived from PRR5, a proline-rich protein that has an implicative role in tumorigenesis (1Johnstone C.N. Castellvi-Bel S. Chang L.M. Sung R.K. Bowser M.J. Pique J.M. Castells A. Rustgi A.K. Genomics. 2005; 85: 338-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The PRR5 gene is located on chromosome 22q13.31, a region that is frequently deleted during human breast and colorectal carcinogenesis. PRR5 was previously shown to exist as several isoforms of splicing variants (1Johnstone C.N. Castellvi-Bel S. Chang L.M. Sung R.K. Bowser M.J. Pique J.M. Castells A. Rustgi A.K. Genomics. 2005; 85: 338-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PRR5, containing a high content of proline residues (28 among 388 amino acids, 7.2%), is conserved in higher eukaryotes. BLAST search revealed that human PRR5 shares 33–86% identity with genes from amphibians, fishes, rodents, and primates but does not show similarity to genes from Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans as well as BIT61 and AVO2, two TOR2-interacting proteins whose mammalian homologues have not been found (supplemental Fig. S1). PRR5 residues 91–169 share sequence similarity with the HbrB domain, a domain found in proteins involved in hyphal growth and polarity (28Gatherar I.M. Pollerman S. Dunn-Coleman N. Turner G. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2004; 41: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The longest isoform (isoform 1) contains 388 amino acids with a proline-rich region near the C terminus (Fig. 1A). Isoforms 2 and 3 are 9 and 95 amino acids shorter than isoform 1 at the N terminus, respectively. To confirm that mTOR specifically interacts with PRR5, mTOR immunoprecipitate was obtained from HEK293T cells and the amount of transiently expressed PRR5 isoform 2, a highly expressed form of the three isoforms (Fig. 1A), was analyzed by Western blotting. Supporting the specific interaction between mTOR and PRR5, PRR5 was detected only in mTOR immunoprecipitate purified in the absence of an mTOR antibody-blocking peptide but not in the presence of the blocking peptide or in immunoprecipitates obtained using control antibodies (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the specific interaction between mTOR and PRR5, endogenous mTOR was isolated in immunoprecipitates of recombinant PRR5 but not in control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C). We generated polyclonal antibodies specific to human PRR5 using GST fusion PRR5 full-length protein or an epitope peptide near the C terminus as an antigen. The latter antibody was able to pull down endogenous PRR5 that is associated with endogenous mTOR (Fig. 1D). Using the PRR5-specific antibody, we confirmed that endogenous PRR5 is purified specifically by anti-mTOR immunoprecipitation but not control antibodies (Fig. 1E). Tissue distribution of human PRR5 mRNA had been reported previously (1Johnstone C.N. Castellvi-Bel S. Chang L.M. Sung R.K. Bowser M.J. Pique J.M. Castells A. Rustgi A.K. Genomics. 2005; 85: 338-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PRR5 mRNA is most abundant in kidney and liver. It is also highly detected in brain, spleen, testis, and placenta. Northern blot analysis had shown multiple different-sized bands evident in tissues including spleen, testis, and heart. We observed that PRR5 is expressed in different amounts in several human cell lines such as 293T, HeLa, HepG2, human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, and human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1F). In these cells, we observed that PRR5 is immunoprecipitated by mTOR antibody (Fig. 1G). MDA-MB-231 expresses little amount of isoforms 1 and 2, a result consistent with reverse transcription PCR data (1Johnstone C.N. Castellvi-Bel S. Chang L.M. Sung R.K. Bowser M.J. Pique J.M. Castells A. Rustgi A.K. Genomics. 2005; 85: 338-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PRR5 is most highly expressed in 293T cells, a cell line derived from the kidney where PRR5 mRNA level is most abundant (1Johnstone C.N. Castellvi-Bel S. Chang L.M. Sung R.K. Bowser M.J. Pique J.M. Castells A. Rustgi A.K. Genomics. 2005; 85: 338-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PRR5 Is a Component of mTORC2—Knowing that PRR5 is an interacting protein of mTOR, we questioned which mTOR complex contains PRR5. Importantly, PRR5 was detected in mTOR and rictor immunoprecipitates, but not in raptor immunoprecipitates, suggesting that PRR5 specifically targets mTORC2 (Fig. 2A). Supporting that a large proportion of the mTOR-rictor complex contains PRR5, a higher amount of Myc-tagged PRR5 was recovered bound to rictor than Myc-mTOR, although both Myc-tagged proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2B). We thought that a stronger association of rictor with PRR5 than mTOR might support a role of rictor in the mediation of the PRR5-mTOR interaction. To test the possibility that PRR5 binding to mTOR requires rictor, we knocked down rictor in 293T cells through a lentiviral shRNA transduction and determined the amount of PRR5 associated with mTOR in mTOR immunoprecipitate. Rictor silencing led to a significant reduction in the amount of PRR5 not only in mTOR immunoprecipitate but also in cell lysate, indicating that rictor is important for the stability of PRR5 (Fig. 3A). Sin1, another component of mTORC2, has been shown to be important for the mTOR-rictor interaction (14Vander Haar E. Lee S-I. Bandhakavi S. Griffin T.J. Kim D.-H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 29Frias M.A. Thoreen C.C. Jaffe J.D. Schroder W. Sculley T. Carr S.A. Sabatini D.M. Curr.

Unlike Sin1 silencing, PRR5 silencing did not lead to a change in the affinity of the interaction between mTOR and rictor, supporting that PRR5 is not important for the rictor-mTOR interaction (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this result, overexpression of PRR5 did not alter the affinity of the mTOR-rictor interaction, an interaction stabilized by Sin1 overexpression (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the PRR5-mTOR interaction, but not the PRR5-rictor interaction, was destabilized in a lysis buffer containing Triton X-100 (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating that the PRR5-rictor interaction is resistant to the detergent condition that disrupts the mTOR-rictor interaction (10Kim D-H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that PRR5 binds rictor preferentially and independently of mTOR and rictor is important for the mTOR-PRR5 interaction. PRR5 Residues 10–95 and 188–218 Are Crucial for Binding Rictor—Knowing that PRR5 interacts with mTOR and rictor, we questioned whether all the isoforms interact with mTOR and rictor isoforms. We expressed HA-tagged isoforms in 293T cells and analyzed the amount of endogenous mTOR and rictor recovered with HA-PPR5 isoforms in HA immunoprecipitate. Supporting that isoforms 1 and 2 interact with mTOR and rictor, we observed that endogenous mTOR and rictor are immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged isoforms 1 and 2, but not with isoform 3 (Fig. 4A). Confirming the specific interaction of isoforms 1 and 2 with mTOR and rictor, only isoforms 1 and 2, but not isoform 3, expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli pulled down endogenous mTOR and rictor (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the N-terminal 95 amino acids contain residues important for binding mTOR and rictor. The N-terminal region of PRR5 overlaps with the residues conserved among higher eukaryotic genes (supplemental Fig. S1), supporting that the interaction with rictor is likely important during the evolution of higher eukaryotes. To search for C-terminal residues important for binding mTOR and rictor, we made C-terminal-truncated mutants of PRR5 and tested the mutants for their ability to bi"

Estrogen receptor-α (ERα) is essential for normal mammary gland physiology and is a prognostic marker for the treatment of breast cancer. We report that Per2, a core clock gene, links the circadian cycle to the ERα signaling network. Binding of enhances ERα degradation, while suppression of Per2 levels leads to ERα stabilization. In turn, Per2 itself is estrogen inducible in these cells, suggesting a feedback mechanism to attenuate stimulation by estrogen. In addition, overexpression of Per2 in breast cancer cells leads to significant growth inhibition, loss of clonogenic ability and apoptosis. Taken together, these results further support a critical role for peripheral circadian regulation in tissue homeostasis and suggest a novel role for clock genes in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer."

Here we show that a significant fraction of mature ATM-deficient lymphocytes contain telomere-deleted ends produced by failed end joining during V(D)J recombination. These RAG-1/2 endonuclease-dependent, terminally deleted chromosomes persist in peripheral lymphocytes for at least 2 weeks in vivo and are stable over several generations in vitro. Restoration of ATM kinase activity in mature lymphocytes that have transiently lost ATM function leads to loss of cells with terminally deleted chromosomes. Thus, maintenance of genomic stability in lymphocytes requires faithful end joining as well a checkpoint that prevents the long-term persistence and transmission of DSBs. Silencing this checkpoint permits DNA ends produced by V(D)J recombination in a lymphoid precursor to serve as substrates for translocations with chromosomes subsequently damaged by other means in mature cells.

Silencing this checkpoint permits DNA ends produced by V(D)J recombination in a lymphoid precursor to serve as substrates for translocations with chromosomes subsequently damaged by other means in mature cells. Developing lymphocytes initiate antigen-receptor diversification by expression of the RAG-1/2 endonuclease, which introduces DSBs in recombination-signal sequences flanking immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor-coding gene segments (V, D, and J segments) (Jung et al., 2006Jung D.

Immunol. 2006; 24: 541-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The subsequent ligation of ends to form functional antigen-receptor genes is carried out by components of the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA-repair pathway. V(D)J recombination-associated DSBs are formed and repaired in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (Schlissel et al., 1993Schlissel M. Constantinescu A. Morrow T. Baxter M. Peng A.

Factors involved in DSB-damage surveillance, Nbs1, ATM, 53BP1, and phosphorylated H2AX, are found at sites of antigen-receptor gene DSBs and also appear to suppress V(D)J-associated oncogenic chromosomal translocations (Bassing et al., 2003Bassing C.H.

B and T cell receptors are assembled in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively, in hierarchical maturation processes that take several days to complete (Jung et al., 2006Jung D. Giallourakis C. Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Mechanism and control of V(D)J recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 541-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The B cell receptor (BCR) consists of a pair of heavy chains (IgH) and light (Igλ or Igκ) chains, whereas the T cell receptor (TCRβ/TCRα) is formed by pairing TCR beta and alpha chains. Assembly of the Ig heavy chain is initiated before light-chain gene rearrangements, and similarly TCRβ rearrangements precede TCRα recombination. Productive rearrangement of Ig heavy and TCRβ genes promotes a signaling cascade that extinguishes expression of RAG-1/2 genes and induces proliferation of pre-B and pre-T cells, respectively (Meffre et al., 2000Meffre E. Casellas R. Nussenzweig M.C. Antibody regulation of B cell development.Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The developing lymphocytes undergo two to seven rounds of cell division before they re-express RAG-1/2 and initiate Ig light-chain or TCRα gene rearrangements (Meffre et al., 2000Meffre E.

Immature bone marrow B cells and thymic T cells that express a complete antigen receptor emigrate to the peripheral immune system, where they complete maturation and populate secondary lymphoid organs such as spleen and lymph node. Mature B cells undergo an additional programmed DNA cleavage reaction that is associated with proliferation, class-switch recombination. This recombination reaction replaces one Ig constant region with another and positions a new constant region next to the rearranged VDJ exon. Switching is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme expressed exclusively in mature B cells (Muramatsu et al., 1999Muramatsu M. Sankaranand V.S. Anant S. Sugai M.

AID-dependent DSBs in the Ig switch regions are joined together through NHEJ resulting in excision of up to 200 kb of intervening DNA. Like DSBs induced by V(D)J recombination, AID-dependent DSBs form in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and are monitored by the DSB-damage surveillance proteins ATM, H2AX, 53BP1, and Nbs1 (Petersen et al., 2001Petersen S.

ATM is required for efficient recombination between immunoglobulin switch regions.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 1103-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that besides AID, an additional source of IgH-specific DNA damage contributes to Chr12 aberrations in mature ATM-deficient lymphocytes. Here we show that a significant fraction of long-lived peripheral Atm−/− lymphocytes harbor unresolved recombination activating gene (RAG)-dependent DSBs that were generated in progenitor cells. These findings uncover that an ATM checkpoint blocks transmission of V(D)J breaks and could thereby prevent translocations between proto-oncogenes and antigen-receptor genes damaged in precursor cells. To determine the etiology of unrepaired chromosome breaks in Atm−/− B cells, we generated mice deficient in ATM and AID. Mature (CD43−) splenic B cells from Atm+/+Aid+/+ (WT), Atm−/−Aid+/+ (Atm−/−), Atm+/+Aid−/− (Aid−/−), and Atm−/−Aid−/− mice were activated in vitro by stimulation with LPS+IL4. Class switching was assessed by measuring surface IgG1 expression at day 4, and, as expected, switching was reduced in ATM-deficient mice (Lumsden et al., 2004Lumsden J.M. McCarty T. Petiniot L.K.

Metaphase spreads analyzed on day 3 cultures using chr12-, telomere-, and IgHCα-specific probes (Ramiro et al., 2006aRamiro A.R. Jankovic M. Callen E. Difilippantonio S. Chen H.T. McBride K.M.

These aberrations included chromosome breaks, chromatid breaks, dicentrics, and translocations (Table S1); however, the vast majority of aberrations in Atm−/− (76%) and Atm−/−Aid−/− (68%) B cells were chromosome breaks (Table S1) (Franco et al., 2006Franco S.

Disruption of ATM in p53-null cells causes multiple functional abnormalities in cellular response to ionizing radiation.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7002-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATM regulates the repair of DSBs generated in the prereplicative phase of the cell cycle. In contrast to genome-wide aberrations, breaks and translocations specifically associated with the Ig heavy-chain locus were statistically different between the three groups. Ig-specific lesions were found in 23% of Atm−/− metaphases (n = 3 independent stimulations), 11% of Atm−/−Aid−/− metaphases (n = 3), and 0.4% of WT metaphases (n = 3) (Figures 1B and 1C and Table S1). Chr12-specific breaks that accumulated in Atm−/− (total 0.2 per cell) and Atm−/−Aid−/− (total 0.08 per cell) B cells were distributed among those that were centromeric (downstream) and telomeric (upstream) of IgHCα, with the majority localized downstream (Figure 1C and Table S1). Distinct breakpoints in the Ig heavy-chain locus could either reflect different types of initiating lesions (e.g., recombination+ common fragile sites, see below) or could be indicative of a single lesion combined with varying degrees of chromosomal erosion. Altogether, only half of the Chr12 aberrations in Atm−/− B cells stimulated with LPS and IL-4 are AID dependent (Figure 1B), which contrasts with 53BP1 and H2AX deficiency, where IgH-associated lesions are entirely dependent on AID (Franco et al., 2006Franco S.

In addition to chromosome breaks, 4% of Atm−/− metaphases and 2.5% of Atm−/−Aid−/− metaphases contained translocations associated with the IgH locus (Figure 1C and Table S1). However, when we assayed for specific translocations between c-myc and Ig switch regions by PCR (Figure 1D), these fusions were undetectable in Atm−/−Aid−/− mice while accumulating at a high frequency (1.6 × 10−6) in Atm−/− mice. This is consistent with the requirement for AID in canonical c-myc-IgH switch translocations (Ramiro et al., 2006aRamiro A.R. Jankovic M. Callen E. Difilippantonio S. Chen H.T. McBride K.M. Eisenreich T.R. Chen J. Dickins R.A. Lowe S.W. et al.Role of genomic instability and p53 in AID-induced c-myc-Igh translocations.Nature. 2006; 440: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We conclude that only a subset of the Ig heavy chain-associated translocations originate from AID-dependent DNA damage in Atm−/− B cells stimulated to undergo CSR. Ig-associated DNA breaks in Atm−/− B cells might arise as a result of DNA-replication stress incurred at fragile sites during the two to seven rounds of division in B cells stimulated with LPS+IL4, or they might be present in resting mature B cells before stimulation. To assay for Ig-associated fragile sites, we cultured activated WT and Atm−/− B cells with low doses of aphidicolin (0.05–0.3 μg/ml), an inhibitor of DNA replication that is a potent inducer of fragile site expression (Arlt et al., 2006Arlt M.F. Durkin S.G. Ragland R.L. Glover T.W. Common fragile sites as targets for chromosome rearrangements.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 1126-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). WT B cells cultured with 0.1 μg/ml aphidicolin showed the expected increase in chromatid gaps and breaks in metaphase chromosomes. Chromosomal aberrations were found in 51% of aphidicolin-treated WT cells (Figure 2A) compared to 0.9% in untreated cultures (Figure 1B); however, aphidicolin treatment did not produce chromosomal breaks in the vicinity of the Ig heavy-chain locus (Figure 2A). Moreover, although abrogation of the S and G2/M checkpoint generally enhances fragile-site expression (Casper et al., 2002Casper A.M. Nghiem P. Arlt M.F. Glover T.W. ATR regulates fragile site stability.Cell. 2002; 111: 779-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), treatment of Atm−/− B cells with aphidicolin did not increase the percentage of cells with Ig heavy-chain locus breaks (Figures 1B and 2A) Thus, replication stress does not appear to specifically target the Ig heavy-chain locus in WT or Atm−/− B cells stimulated with LPS and IL-4. To determine whether lesions in the Ig heavy-chain locus are present in unstimulated mature B cells, we assayed purified morphologically preserved splenic B cells using three-dimensional FISH with telomeric VH and centromeric Cα probes (Figure 2B). Both probes were detectable in >98% of WT (n = 511) and Aid−/− cells (n = 402, not shown) as two pairs of closely apposed signals. In contrast, 6.7% of Atm−/− (n = 342) and 7.8% of Atm−/−Aid−/− (n = 422) B cells had lost either VH or both VH and Cα signals from one allele (Figure 2B; Atm−/− versus WT, p = 0.00085; Atm−/−Aid−/− versus WT, p = 0.000024; two-tailed p values). Consistent with the fact that AID is not expressed in resting B cells, the loss of integrity of the Ig heavy-chain locus was not statistically different between Atm−/− and Atm−/−Aid−/− B cells (p = 0.58; two-tailed p values) (Figure 2B). We conclude that a subset of resting Atm−/− and Atm−/−Aid−/− B cells harbor deletions in the Ig heavy-chain locus. The observed disruption of the Ig locus in resting peripheral Atm−/− B cells may have originated earlier in B cell development. To determine whether telomere-deleted chr12 ends were detectable in B cell precursors, we cultured Atm−/−Aid−/− and WT pre-B cells (CD19+IgM−) from bone marrow and examined metaphases using the Ig heavy chain locus-specific FISH assay. Whereas Ig breaks were undetectable in WT pre-B cells (n = 70), these lesions were found in 11% of Atm−/−Aid−/− pre-B cells (n = 80 metaphases) (Figure 2C). Similar levels of Ig-associated DSBs were detected in the mature splenic B cell compartment from the same mouse (Figure 2C). The finding that a significant fraction of Atm−/−Aid−/− pre-B cells contain copies of chr12 that are broken at the Ig heavy-chain locus is consistent with the observation that after V(D)J recombination unrepaired coding ends accumulate and dissociate from the postcleavage complex in Atm−/− pre B cells (Bredemeyer et al., 2006Bredemeyer A.L.

Analogous to the persistence of AID-independent Ig heavy-chain DSBs in B cells, we hypothesized that telomere-deleted chromosome ends might also accumulate in mature Atm−/− T cells. To determine whether terminally deleted chromosomes are present in mature ATM-deficient T cells, we stimulated lymph node T cells for 48 hr with anti-CD28 and -TCR antibodies and examined metaphase spreads using a chromosome 14 (chr14)-painting probe in conjunction with a BAC probe spanning the TCRα locus as well as a telomere-specific probe (Figures S1A and S1B). Consistent with a previous report (Liyanage et al., 2000Liyanage M. Weaver Z. Barlow C. Coleman A. Pankratz D.G. Anderson S. Wynshaw-Boris A. Ried T.

In addition to TCRα-specific translocations, 5.6% of mature Atm−/− T cells harbored telomere-deleted chromosome ends near the TCRα locus (Figures S1A and S1B). As observed for the Ig heavy-chain locus (Table S1), some of the chromosomes were broken between Vα and Cα (Figure S1A; del[14]), whereas others were deleted beyond the TCRα locus toward the centromere of chr14 (Figure S1A; del[14]ΔTCRα).

Using neutron Larmor diffraction to overcome the traditional resolution limit of diffraction experiments, we studied the lattice constants of the cubic itinerant-electron magnet manganese silicide (MnSi) at low temperatures and high pressures. We were able to resolve the nature of the phase diagram of MnSi and to establish that a stable, extended non–Fermi liquid state emerges under applied pressure without quantum criticality.

The CXCR4 receptor is a broadly expressed chemokine receptor, which in contrast to chemokine receptors in general, is found not only on cells within the immune system, but also, for example, in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal system (1Unutmaz D.

Neurovirol. 2002; 8: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The CXCR4 receptor is activated by a single chemokine, CXCL12 (previously called stromal-derived factor-1) in contrast to the promiscuous binding of several chemokines by other chemokine receptors. CXCR4 is involved in the migration and homing of leukocytes, and importantly it plays a central role for the anchorage of CD34+ stem cells in bone marrow.

Importantly, we were able to successfully transfer the essential components of this rather simple tridentate binding mode of the prototype CXCR4 non-peptide antagonist AMD3100 into the otherwise rather distinct CXCR3 receptor (11Rosenkilde M.M.

Despite the fact that AMD3100 is a highly potent and specific CXCR4 antagonist, it does not exhibit oral bioavailability presumably due to the positive charge (+2) of each ring at physiological pH (13Hendrix C.W.

Long term treatment in HIV-infected persons may therefore be difficult. However, subcutaneous administration in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor improves stem cell mobilization yields in patients undergoing transplantation (32Larochelle A. Krouse A.

In the present study we characterize the molecular mechanism of action of a novel series of monocyclam CXCR4 antagonists designed from the prototype symmetrical bicyclam AMD3100 (Fig. 1). In these compounds one of the cyclam rings was substituted with aromatic phenyl or pyridine rings (the “non-cyclam part”) linked by an N-substituted aliphatic chain and the original phenylenebismethylene linker to the remaining cyclam ring (i.e. the “cyclam part”). In the prototype monocyclam AMD3465, a high affinity CXCR4 antagonist that efficiently inhibits HIV cell entry via CXCR4 (16Hatse S. Princen K. De Clercq E. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Hernandez-Abad P.E. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schols D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 70: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the cyclam ring was substituted with a 2-pyridylmethylamine moiety (Fig. 1). We describe the binding of AMD3465 as well as its antagonistic properties in respect of blocking CXCL12-induced activation and HIV cell entry. The binding properties were determined by the use of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody 12G5 that interacts with a broader spectrum of CXCR4 mutants compared with the previously used radiolabeled CXCL12 (10Gerlach L.O. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14153-14160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Importantly, the relative binding mode of the cyclam versus the non-cyclam part of AMD3465 in the CXCR4 receptor was characterized by use of a large library of receptor mutants and a series of selected analogs of this prototype monocyclam antagonist with modifications in each end of the molecule. Materials—The human chemokine CXCL12 was purchased from Peprotech. The CXCR4-specific monoclonal antibody 12G5 was kindly provided by Jim Hoxie (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Human CXCR4 cDNA was kindly provided by Timothy N. C. Wells (Serono Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Geneva, Switzerland). The promiscuous chimeric G-protein GαΔ6qi4myr was kindly provided by Evi Kostenis (7TM-Pharma, Denmark). myo-[3H]Inositol (PT6-271) and Bolton-Hunter reagent for iodination of 12G5 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin was from Bio-Rad. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations were introduced in the receptor by the polymerase chain reaction overlap extension technique (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) using the wild type CXCR4 as template. All reactions were carried out using the Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The generated mutations were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3+. The mutations were verified by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing (ABI 310, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Iodination of 12G5—The Bolton-Hunter reagent was dried by a gentle stream of nitrogen for 30-60 min. 250 pmol of 12G5 was incubated on ice with 1 mCi of Bolton-Hunter reagent in a total volume of 50 μl of 0.1 mm borate buffer, pH 8.5, for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.25 ml of the borate buffer supplemented with 0.2 m glycine and Bolton-Hunter-labeled 12G5 separated from free Bolton-Hunter reagent by column chromatography (Econo-Pac DC10, Bio-Rad) (18Signoret N.

Transfections and Tissue Culture—COS-7 cells were grown at 10% CO2 and 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamax (Invitrogen, catalog number 21885-025) adjusted with 10% fetal bovine serum, 180 units/ml penicillin, and 45 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection of the COS-7 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (19Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Brauner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Human astroglioma U87 cells expressing human CD4 (U87.CD4) (20Bjorndal A. Deng H. Jansson M. Fiore J.R. Colognesi C. Karlsson A. Albert J. Scarlatti G. Littman D.R. Fenyo E.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7478-7487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dan R. Littman (Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York) and cultured at 10% CO2 and 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.01 m Hepes, and 0.2 mg/ml geneticin (G-418 sulfate). The CXCR4 encoding plasmids were cotransfected with the pPUR selection vector encoding puromycin resistance (Clontech) into U87.CD4 cells by the use of FuGENE™ 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Puromycin (1 μg/ml) selection was started after 18 h. After ∼3 weeks, the puromycin-resistant cell cultures containing 10-30% CXCR4-positive cells were established for each of the CXCR4 variants. The CXCR4-expressing cells were isolated from these cell cultures as follows. Approximately 4 × 106 cells in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum were incubated with 20 μl of non-conjugated mouse anti-human CXCR4 antibody clone 12G5 for 30 min at room temperature. After two washing steps, the cells were incubated with 2 × 106 sheep anti-mouse IgG-conjugated Dynabeads® M450 (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) in 8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 2% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 4 °C under continuous gentle rotation. Thereafter, the CXCR4-positive cells (which had bound magnetic beads at their surface) were isolated from the cell suspension by magnetic separation and were thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to puromycin-containing growth medium. The CXCR4 expression was checked with phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (clone 12G5) (BD Biosciences) and evaluated by flow cytometrically (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Binding Experiments—COS-7 cells were transferred to culture plates 1 day after transfection. The number of cells seeded per well was determined by the apparent expression efficiency of the receptors and was aimed at obtaining 5-10% specific binding of the added radioactive ligand (2 × 104 to 1 × 105 cells/well for the different CXCR4 constructs). Two days after transfection, cells were assayed by competition binding for 3 h at 4 °C using 32 pm 125I-12G5 plus unlabeled ligand in 0.5 ml of a 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After incubation cells were washed quickly two times in 4 °C binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl. Nonspecific binding was determined as the binding in the presence of 0.1 μm unlabeled 12G5. Determinations were made in duplicates. Phosphatidylinositol Assay (PI Turnover)—COS-7 cells were transfected according to the procedure mentioned above. Briefly, 6 × 106 cells were transfected with 20 μg of receptor cDNA in addition to 30 μg of the promiscuous chimeric G-protein, GαΔ6qi4myr (abbreviated as Gqi4myr), which turns the Gαi-coupled signal, most common pathway for endogenous chemokine receptors, into the Gαq pathway (phospholipase C activation measured as PI turnover) (21Kostenis E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 560-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). One day after transfection, COS-7 cells (2.5 × 104 cells/well) were incubated for 24 h with 2 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol in 0.4 ml of growth medium per well. Cells were washed twice in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin; and were incubated in 0.4 ml of buffer supplemented with 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C for 90 min in the presence of various concentrations of chemokines or AMD analogs together with a constant concentration of chemokine corresponding to 80% of maximal stimulation. Cells were extracted by addition of 1 ml of 10 mm formic acid to each well followed by incubation on ice for 30-60 min. The generated [3H]inositol phosphates were purified on AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin (22Berridge M.J. Dawson M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvin R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Determinations were made in duplicates. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Mobilization—On the day prior to the experiment, the U87.CD4.CXCR4 transfectants were seeded in 0.1% gelatin-coated 96-well black wall microplates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at 2 × 104 cells per well. On the day of the experiment, the cells were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) at 4 μm for 45 min at 37 °C. After thorough washing with calcium flux assay buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution with 20 mm Hepes buffer and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), the cells were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C with AMD3100 or AMD3465 (1 μg/ml) in the same buffer. Then, the intracellular calcium mobilization in response to 2-50 ng/ml CXCL12 was measured at 37 °C by monitoring the fluorescence as a function of time simultaneously in all the wells using a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) (23Hatse S. Princen K. Gerlach L.O. Bridger G. Henson G. De Clercq E. Schwartz T.W. Schols D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Infection Assays—The CXCR4-using (X4) HIV-1 molecular clone NL4.3 was obtained from the National Institutes of Health NIAID AIDS Reagent program (Bethesda, MD), and the HIV-1 strain NDK was obtained from the Medical Research Council (MRC) (London, UK). Virus stocks of the clinical isolate (CI) number 10 was generated by co-culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy donor with lymphocytes from an HIV-1-infected person. U87.CD4 cells transfected with CXCR4 WT or mutants were digested using trypsin. These cells were washed and resuspended at 5 × 104 cells/ml in medium and seeded out at 2 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates. The compounds (AMD3100 and AMD3465) were added at different concentrations together with the HIV-1 laboratory strain or CI number 10 and the plates were maintained at 37 °C in 10% CO2. The cytopathic effect in the virus-infected cell cultures was evaluated microscopically at 5 days after infection. Then the supernatant was collected and analyzed for virus content based on the p24 core silver enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DuPont-Merck Pharmaceutical Co.). Calculations—IC50 and EC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression and Bmax values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Previously we have shown that AMD3100 is highly and almost solely dependent upon three acidic, anchor-point residues in the main ligand binding pocket of CXCR4: AspIV:20 (Asp171) in TM-IV, believed to interact with one of the cyclam moieties, as well as AspVI:23 (Asp262) and GluVII:06 (Glu288), which are believed to “sandwich” the other cyclam ring of AMD3100 between TM-VI and TM-VII (10Gerlach L.O. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14153-14160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 11Rosenkilde M.M. Gerlach L.O. Jakobsen J.S. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3033-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Importantly, the high potency and efficacy of AMD3100 requires the presence of a rigid linker between the two cyclam moieties (10Gerlach L.O. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14153-14160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Previously described monocyclams as well as bicyclams with flexible linkers that were less potent were shown only to be dependent upon AspIV:20 (10Gerlach L.O. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14153-14160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). AMD3465 is a novel, high potency monocyclam in which one of the cyclam rings of AMD3100 has been exchanged with a N-pyridinylmethylene moiety (Fig. 1) (16Hatse S. Princen K. De Clercq E. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Hernandez-Abad P.E. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schols D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 70: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Common Interaction Points for AMD3465 and AMD3100 in the CXCR4 Receptor—In competition against the radiolabeled monoclonal antibody raised against CXCR4, 12G5, the affinity of AMD3465 was 8-fold higher compared with AMD3100 (Fig. 2, Table 1). Using this competition binding assay we initially probed the binding of AMD3465 in a library of 23 mutants of CXCR4 having substitutions in the main ligand binding pocket, including the three acidic anchor-point residues of AMD3100. In most cases the side chain was substituted with the small methyl group of Ala. Yet, in some cases a structurally similar but uncharged Asn residue was introduced instead of a charged Asp. In other cases steric hindrance mutagenesis was performed through introduction of larger side chains such as Phe or Trp for Ala, Gly, or Ile (24Holst B. Zoffmann S. Elling C.E. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The substitutions had no or a very limited effect on 12G5 binding to the CXCR4 receptor as reflected in the Kd and Bmax values with less than 10-fold difference between the lowest and highest values (Table 1). This indicated that the overall structure as well as the cell surface expression of the receptor was generally unaffected by the mutations.TABLE 1Affinity of 12G5, AMD3100, and AMD3465 for the wild-type CXCR4 and various CXCR4 mutations Open table in a new tab The binding of AMD3465 was affected more than 10-fold by 11 of the substitutions of which four were shared by AMD3100, i.e. the Asn/Ala substitutions of the three acidic anchor-point AspIV:20, AspVI:23, and GluVII:06 and the steric hindrance mutation of AlaIV:24 (Ala175) to Phe (A175F)-CXCR4. The magnitude of effects of the AspIV:20 and GluVII:06 substitutions (D171N)- and (E288A)-CXCR4, respectively, were similar for AMD3465 and AMD3100, whereas the effects of the AspVI:23 substitution (D262N)-CXCR4 and the steric hindrance substitution of AlaIV:24 (A175F)-CXCR4 were much higher for AMD3465 than for AMD3100. Thus, the affinity of AMD3465 was decreased >5000-fold in (D262N)-CXCR4 and 1913-fold in (A175F)-CXCR4, whereas these mutations only affected AMD3100 binding 52- and 40-fold, respectively (Fig. 3). Mutations Affecting AMD3465 but Not AMD3100 Binding—Among the 7 mutations that specifically affected AMD3465 but not AMD3100 binding, His281 to Ala (H281A)-CXCR4, which is located in extracellular loop 3 close to the start of TM-VII (in position VII:-02), affected the binding affinity of AMD3465 >4500-fold compared with WT CXCR4 (Table 1, Fig. 2). The affinity of AMD3100 was in fact improved slightly by this mutation (Table 1, Fig. 2). Ala substitutions of two other residues in TM-VII also impaired the binding affinity of AMD3465, but not AMD3100, namely IleVII:02 (Ile284) and ThrVII:05 (Thr287) resulting in a 410- and 17-fold decrease in the affinity of AMD3465 compared with WT CXCR4, respectively (Table 1). Steric hindrance mutagenesis of IleVI:20 (Ile259), located on the opposing face of TM-VI i.e. in the same part of the binding pocket (Fig. 1), to Trp (I259W)-CXCR4 resulted in a 158-fold decrease in the affinity for AMD3465 (Table 1). Mutations of two residues in TM-V, both facing the main binding pocket, also affected the binding of AMD3465 but to a lesser degree. Thus, substitution of ValV:01 (Val196) to Ala (V196A)-CXCR4 resulted in a 16-fold decrease in AMD3465 affinity, whereas substitution of GlnV:05 to Trp (Q200W)-CXCR4 resulted in a 10-fold decrease in the affinity for AMD3465 (Table 1). None of the mutations in TM-IV affected the binding of AMD3465 more than 10-fold, except for the Ala substitution of AspIV:20 (D171N)-CXCR4 discussed above as a common hit for AMD3465 and AMD3100. In contrast, the mutational analysis identified one residue in TM-III, HisIII:05 (His113), as being important for AMD3465 binding. This residue is facing right into the middle of the main ligand binding pocket. Despite this, Ala substitution of HisIII:05 (H113A)-CXCR4 did not affect on the binding of AMD3100, whereas the affinity of AMD3465 was decreased 23-fold (Table 1). Thus, the major result of the mutational analysis using the 12G5 monoclonal antibody as a radioligand was the identification of several additional residues of importance for the binding of AMD3465 compared with AMD3100. The three acidic, anchor-point residues for AMD3100 were shared by AMD3465. However, several additional residues facing right into the main binding pocket were uncovered as being selectively important for AMD3465. Of these, the His281 in position VII:-02 was of highest importance, followed by IleVII:02, i.e. located one helical turn below His281 as well as HisIII:05. Correlation between Inhibition of Receptor Activity and Affinity Measured against Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody—The affinity of bicyclam analogs measured against 125I-12G5 as radioligand has previously been shown to correlate to the affinity obtained using 125I-CXCL12 (stromal cell-derived factor-1α) as a radioligand (10Gerlach L.O. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14153-14160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, we have observed mutants with impaired binding of 125I-CXCL12, e.g. the Ala substitution of GluVII:06 in CXCR4 (11Rosenkilde M.M. Gerlach L.O. Jakobsen J.S. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3033-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Therefore, to get a complete picture of the ability of AMD3465 to antagonize CXCL12-induced signaling activity we decided to probe the library of CXCR4 mutants in a functional assay previously used to map the interaction mode of AMD3100 (11Rosenkilde M.M. Gerlach L.O. Jakobsen J.S. Skerlj R.T. Bridger G.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3033-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the receptor construct of interest together with the promiscuous G-protein Gqi4myr (21Kostenis E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 560-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the ability of AMD3465 and AMD3100 to inhibit PI turnover induced by submaximal doses of CXCL12 were assessed. Using this approach, the overall picture of residues of importance for AMD3465 binding, compared with AMD3100 binding, was basically the same as identified in competition against 125I-12G5 (Table 2 compared with Table 1). Thus, again the three acidic key residues for AMD3100 binding were identified as being important also for AMD3465. Among these AspVI:23 again had the biggest impact for AMD3465 function as compared with AMD3100 because the inhibitory potency of AMD3465 was decreased 804-fold for (D262N)-CXCR4 compared with WT CXCR4 and only 21-fold for AMD3100.TABLE 2Functional analysis of the interaction between CXCR4 WT and mutants with AMD3100 and the monocyclam AMD3465 Open table in a new tab The complete picture of residues with selective importance for the interaction of AMD3465 (but not AMD3100) with CXCR4 was somehow simpler in the functional test. Thus, only 3 residues, HisVII:-02, GlnV:05, and HisIII:05, of the 7 residues identified in the competition binding setup (described above) were identified in respect of inhibition of CXCL12-induced CXCR4 activation. Consistent with the identified impact of (H281A)-CXCR4 in the competition binding (Fig. 2), this substitution again had the biggest impact with a 164-fold decrease in the potency of AMD3465, whereas the corresponding inhibitory potency for AMD3100 was unaffected (Fig. 4). The steric hindrance substitution (Q200W) and the Ala introd"
https://openalex.org/W2041311196,We report a previously unknown process in which anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use nitrite as an electron donor for photosynthesis. We isolated a purple sulfur bacterium 98% identical to Thiocapsa species that stoichiometrically oxidizes nitrite to nitrate in the light. Growth and nitrate production strictly depended on both light and nitrite. This is the first known microbial mechanism for the stoichiometric oxidation of nitrite to nitrate in the absence of oxygen and the only known photosynthetic oxidation in the nitrogen cycle. This work demonstrates nitrite as the highest-potential electron donor for anoxygenic photosynthesis known so far.

https://openalex.org/W2029945992,"Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy was used to selectively break the N-H bond of a methylaminocarbyne (CNHCH 3 ) molecule on a Pt(111) surface at 4.7 kelvin, leaving the C-H bonds intact, to form an adsorbed methylisocyanide molecule (CNCH 3 ). The methylisocyanide product was identified through comparison of its vibrational spectrum with that of directly adsorbed methylisocyanide as measured with inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. The CNHCH 3 could be regenerated in situ by exposure to hydrogen at room temperature. The combination of tip-induced dehydrogenation with thermodynamically driven hydrogenation allows a completely reversible chemical cycle to be established at the single-molecule level in this system. By tailoring the pulse conditions, irreversible dissociation entailing cleavage of both the C-H and N-H bonds can also be demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2063447621,"The sodium-hydrogen exchange regulatory factor 1 (NHERF-1/EBP50) interacts with the C terminus of several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We examined the role of NHERF-1 and the cytoskeleton on the distribution, dynamics, and trafficking of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR; a type A receptor), the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R; type B), and the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR; type C) using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, total internal reflection fluorescence, and image correlation spectroscopy. β2AR bundles were observed only in cells that expressed NHERF-1, whereas the PTH1R was localized to bundles that parallel stress fibers independently of NHERF-1. The CaSR was never observed in bundles. NHERF-1 reduced the diffusion of the β2AR and the PTH1R. The addition of ligand increased the diffusion coefficient and the mobile fraction of the PTH1R. Isoproterenol decreased the immobile fraction but did not affect the diffusion coefficient of the β2AR. The diffusion of the CaSR was unaffected by NHERF-1 or the addition of calcium. NHERF-1 reduced the rate of ligand-induced internalization of the PTH1R. This phenomenon was accompanied by a reduction of the rate of arrestin binding to PTH1R in ligand-exposed cells. We conclude that some GPCRs, such as the β2AR, are attached to the cytoskeleton primarily via the binding of NHERF-1. Others, such as the PTH1R, bind the cytoskeleton via several interacting proteins, one of which is NHERF-1.

These microdomains play important functions in signal transduction processes by increasing the rate and efficiency of coupling of key intermolecular interactions involved in specific signaling processes (1Nicolini C.

The cytoskeleton has also been implicated in the regulation of signal transduction processes by serving as a substrate for the anchoring of specific proteins (4Loebrich S. Bahring R. Katsuno T. Tsukita S. Kneussel M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), regulating traffic (5Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and partitioning the cell membrane into microdomains through the formation of effective barriers to the diffusion of lipids and proteins present in the bulk of the plasma membrane (6Jacobson K.

J. 1995; 69: 989-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, this general model of the cytoskeleton's role in the regulation of signaling processes depicts a somewhat passive picture. Most studies of the relationships among cytoskeletal structures and signaling processes focused on the effects of extracellular signals on cytoskeletal reorganization rather than on the effects of the cytoskeleton upon signaling pathways. This view has been recently challenged by the discovery of a family of proteins containing N-terminal postsynaptic density protein (PSD95)/Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor (DlgA)/Zo-1 protein (PDZ) 2The abbreviations used are: PDZ, postsynaptic density protein (PSD95)/Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor (DlgA)/Zo-1 protein; ERM, Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin; β2AR, β-adrenergic receptor type 2; CaSR, calcium-sensing receptor; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; ICS, image correlation spectroscopy; ICCS, image cross-correlation spectroscopy; PTH1R, parathyroid hormone receptor type 1; TIRF, total internal fluorescence; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ANOVA, analysis of variance; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; wt-PTH1R, wild type PTH1R. domains (which interact with a variety of signaling molecules) and a C-terminal Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM)-binding domain (that enables these proteins to interact with cytoskeletal structures) (8Voltz J.W.

Two of the members of this family, the Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factors 1 and 2 (NHERF-1 and −2), interact with and modulate the function of several G protein-coupled receptors (10Weinman E.J.

However, although the data show unequivocally that NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 modulate the function of GPCR, a unified hypothesis to explain the multiple roles of these scaffolding molecules is lacking. Here, we examined the effects of the expression of NHERF-1/EBP50 in the dynamics of three GPCRs: the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R), and the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). The β2AR and the PTH1R are type A and B receptors, respectively, and were chosen because of their well documented interactions with NHERF-1 (10Weinman E.J. Hall R.A. Friedman P.A. Liu-Chen L.Y.

The CaSR is a type C receptor that does not interact with NHERF-1, thus serving as an important control. The data show that the β2AR and the PTH1R are closely associated to actin stress fibers by a mechanism that is modulated by their interactions with NHERF-1. NHERF-1 expression was not required for the cytoskeletal association of the PTH1R; however, the β2AR was found in bundles only in cells expressing NHERF-1. The CaSR was not associated with the cytoskeleton independently of NHERF-1 expression. The diffusion of the PTH1R and the β2AR was strongly influenced by the expression of NHERF-1. Finally, we show that the effects of NHERF-1 on PTH1R traffic are consistent with a novel model in which NHERF-1 interferes with the binding of arrestin to the activated PTH1R. Materials and Constructs—Anti-NHERF-1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-FLAG (M1) was from Sigma, and anti-hemagglutinin (HA11) was purchased from Covance. Anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to TRITC was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. All other materials were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. A pEGFP-N2 plasmid encoding a full-length human PTH1R carboxyl-terminal eGFP fusion protein (PTH1R-eGFP) was kindly provided by C. Silve (INSERM, Paris, France). Similar plasmids coding for the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR-eGFP) and the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR-eGFP) were kindly supplied by Dr. Jeffrey Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University) and Dr. Gerda Breitwieser (Geisinger Medical Center), respectively. Cell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary N10 cells (CHO-N10) were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution at 37 °C/5% CO2. All live cell imaging experiments were done in Mattek dishes in complete medium. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) were used for transient transfections. Confocal Microscopy—An Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope equipped with a SIM scanner was used for all experiments unless otherwise indicated. For live cell imaging experiments, the cells were kept at 37 °C using an open perfusion microincubator (Harvard Apparatus Inc.). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were cultured on glass coverslips, transfected with the desired plasmids, and allowed to grow until 80% confluent. The coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Cells were permeabilized with 5% nonfat milk, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C and then stained with either phalloidin-TRITC (3 nm) or anti-NHERF-1 antibody (1 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Phalloidin-stained cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted using gelvatol. Anti-NHERF-1-stained cells were further treated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with TRITC (1:1000) in 5% nonfat milk for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted with gelvatol, and examined by confocal microscopy. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)—All FRAP measurements were done focusing the microscope onto the plasma membrane adjacent to the coverslip. This region of the cell was chosen for two main reasons: 1) it provides a large surface, and 2) many supplemental studies were done using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), a technique that is limited to the observation of the cell membranes adjacent to the coverslip. The plasma membrane was located using a Z-stack scanning procedure (20Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Circular regions of interest (between 90 and 200 μm2) were selected and bleached with a 1-s pulse from a 405-nm laser line using the Fluoview 1000 SIM scanner, whereas recovery data were acquired using the instrument's main scanner and the 488-nm line of an argon gas laser. This short pulse was selected to ensure a Gaussian bleaching spot. To maximize reproducibility of the experimental conditions, all data were acquired in the photon-counting mode of the instrument. Sixty images were then collected at intervals of 1–1.6 s. The images were exported to Meta-Morph (Universal Imaging, Inc.), and the average fluorescence intensities of the bleached regions and control regions in other cells or far removed regions of the same cell were obtained. The data were fitted to a single exponential decay and plotted using GraphPad Prism. The diffusion coefficient was calculated using the Stokes-Einstein equation for two-dimensional diffusion (D = r2/(4τd), where r is the radius of the bleached spot, and τd is the half-life of fluorescence recovery). Image Correlation Spectroscopy (ICS) and Image Cross-correlation Spectroscopy (ICCS)—These studies were based on the experimental techniques described by Wiseman et al. (21Hebert B. Costantino S. Wiseman P.W. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3601-3614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 22Wiseman P.W. Hoddelius P. Petersen N.O. Magnusson K.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Wiseman P.W. Petersen N.O. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 963-977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and recently reviewed by Bacia and Schwille (24Bacia K. Kim S.A. Schwille P. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and Kim et al. (25Kim S.A. Heinze K.G. Bacia K. Waxham M.N. Schwille P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 4319-4336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The technique measures the correlation of an image with itself after a defined latency time τ. This correlation is a function of the mobility of the fluorescent molecules. The experimental design is, in principle, identical to that used for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, except that in ICS a larger region of the cell is imaged. This allows the acquisition of spatial information that is not available in typical fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments. Two different experimental designs were used for these studies. In some cases, the data were collected with a Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope focused onto the plasma membrane of the cell adjacent to the coverslip. In others, the data were obtained using an Olympus-based TIRF system (see below). For confocal microscopy experiments, a small section of the plasma membrane (<50 μm2) was rapidly scanned (50–60 ms/frame) under low laser power, and up to 300 images were collected. For the TIRF experiments, up to 200 images were obtained consecutively using a 500-ms exposure time. With either experimental set-up, fluorescence loss due to photobleaching of the sample was almost negligible. The image data were exported to ImageJ and analyzed using a plug-in specifically written to calculate the autocorrelation function of the data. This plug-in was based on code developed by A. Tully and E. Levitan (University of Pittsburgh). The resulting autocorrelation data were exported to GraphPad Prism and fit to a single species two-dimensional diffusion model (G(τ) = K(1 + τ/τd)-1 + G0 where τd is the characteristic time constant, K is a proportionality factor, and G0 is a term that accounts for spatial autocorrelation) as described by Hebert et al. (21Hebert B. Costantino S. Wiseman P.W. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3601-3614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The data were also fit to a two-state diffusion model without any significant improvement in the quality of the fit. Therefore, all analyses reported in this paper were done using the single-species diffusion model. For calibration purposes, the diffusion of free intracellular GFP was determined using ICS and FRAP. The values for the diffusion coefficient of GFP obtained by both methods were comparable. ICCS experiments were conducted essentially using the same design, except that images were collected from both green (eGFP) and red (monomeric dsRed) channels. The cross-correlation calculation was performed using an ICCS plug-in for ImageJ developed for this purpose. Fractional binding was calculated from the ratio of the amplitude of the cross-correlation function to the amplitude of the autocorrelation function for PTH1R. These calculations are based on the method described by Kim et al. (25Kim S.A. Heinze K.G. Bacia K. Waxham M.N. Schwille P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 4319-4336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Total Internal Reflection Microscopy—TIRF microscopy studies were conducted using an Olympus 1×71 equipped with a 150-milliwatt argon laser, an Olympus ×60 TIRF objective, a Princeton CCD camera, and Sutter filter wheels. The imaging work station was controlled with SimplePCI software (Compix, Inc.). Typical exposure times of 500 ms were used for most experiments. For ICS measurements, up to 200 images were collected continuously. For endocytosis experiments, images were taken once every 30 s for up to 20 min. The data collected were exported to ImageJ and analyzed using the appropriate plug-ins. Endocytosis Studies—These experiments were done using TIRF microscopy. Cells with or without NHERF-1 were imaged at 37 °C at 30-s intervals for 1–2 min before the addition of the ligand. The microscope was refocused after stimulation of the cells, and image acquisition was continued for an additional 20 min at 30-s intervals. Fluorescence intensity data of the whole cell or of specific regions of interest were exported to GraphPad Prism and analyzed by fitting to a single exponential decay. Statistical Analysis—All multiple comparisons were done using ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-test pairwise comparisons using the analysis routines built in GraphPad Prism. Plates from a minimum of five independent experiments were used for every procedure. Most of the experiments described here were repeated 12 times or more. ICS and ICCS studies were done using ImageJ plug-ins developed in house. These are available upon request. Expression of NHERF-1 in CHO-N10 Cells—These studies were done using a new cell line, derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells. These cells, termed CHO-N10, express NHERF-1 in a tetracycline-inducible manner. We chose CHO cells as a model system for these studies, because they do not express detectable levels of NHERF-1 (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 also shows the induction of NHERF-1 expression 24 h after the addition of various doses of tetracycline. As shown, the expression of NHERF-1 by CHO-N10 cells is exquisitely sensitive to tetracycline. Therefore, CHO-N10 cells appear to be an ideal system to examine the effects of NHERF-1 expression on the dynamics and biochemistry of its interacting proteins. All experiments reported below were done inducing NHERF-1 expression with 50 ng/ml tetracycline for 24 h. GPCRs That Contain C-terminal PDZ Binding Motifs Are Tethered to Actin Stress Fibers—Since NHERF-1 binds GPCR and the cytoskeleton, we first examined the effects of NHERF-1/EBP50 on the distribution of GPCR in live cells transfected with β2AR-eGFP, PTH1R-eGFP, or CaSR-eGFP. TIRF microscopy revealed that the β2AR-eGFP construct aggregated on puncta and bundle-like structures that closely resembled cytoskeletal stress fibers only in cells expressing NHERF-1/EBP50 (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, PTH1R-eGFP accumulated in bundles even in the absence of NHERF-1 expression (Figs. 2, C and D, and 3A). The CaSR chimeras were never observed in bundles (Fig. 2, D and E). Several lines of evidence suggested that these bundle structures were linked to the cytoskeleton. For instance, prolonged serum starvation of the cells reduced significantly the prevalence of receptor bundles. Furthermore, the addition of latrunculin A to disrupt the cytoskeleton rapidly dissipated most of the PTH1R bundles (see, for instance, Fig. 3B), such that 15 min after the addition of latrunculin, no bundles were visible. The relative distribution of the receptors in bundles was determined by morphometric analyses. The results of these measurements are summarized in Table 1. These results illustrate the significant effects of the expression of NHERF-1 on the subcellular distribution of the β2AR. The effects of NHERF-1 on the distribution of the PTH1R were much less dramatic although significant. In contrast, NHERF-1 expression had no detectable effects on the distribution of the CaSR. Finally, to demonstrate that these distributions were not peculiar to CHO cells, the distribution of the PTH1R was examined in HEK293, rat osteosarcoma (ROS), and human osteosarcoma (SaOS2) cells. In all cases, a significant fraction of the PTH1R was found in bundle-like structures (data not shown). To determine the relationship between the receptor bundles and the cytoskeleton, CHO-N10 cells expressing PTH1R-eGFP were fixed and stained with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin. Fig. 3C shows clearly that the bundles parallel actin fibers. As expected, NHERF-1 co-localized with these fibers.FIGURE 3PTH1R distribution on the plasma membrane of CHO-N10 cells. A, TIRF images of the plasma membrane of CHO-N10 cells transfected with PTH1R-eGFP. The cells shown in this image were not induced with tetracycline and therefore did not express NHERF-1. B, the addition of latrunculin A (200 ng/ml; 15 min prior to observation) induced the redistribution of the PTH1R from bundles to the bulk membrane. C, co-localization of PTH1R (green) with F-actin (phalloidin stain; red, left) and co-localization of PTH1R (green) with NHERF-1 (red, right) in CHO-N10 cells induced with tetracycline. D, a mutation of the PDZ domain binding motif of the PTH1R (590ETVM593 → 590ETVA593) reduces the interactions of the receptor with cytoskeletal fibers. E, overexpression of a truncated NHERF-1 mutant that does not contain the ERM-binding domain significantly reduces the binding of PTH1R to cytoskeleton fibers.

The distribution of fluorescent receptors was determined using a threshholding procedure to determine “bundle” and “bulk” fluorescence in regions of interest that comprised most of the surface of each examined cell. The percentage of receptors bound to cytoskeletal bundles was measured from the ratio of the integrated fluorescence of identified bundles to the total integrated fluorescence of the regions of interest. At least six independent Mattek plates were examined for each condition. The number n denotes the total number of cells examined for each condition. The statistical analyses were done by ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests.NHERF-1(-)NHERF-1(+)Percentage fluorescence in bundlesFraction of cells with visible bundlesPercentage fluorescence in bundlesFraction of cells with visible bundles%%β2AR1.2 ± 0.6 (n = 38)1/3819.4 ± 2.7 (n = 27)aDifferent from NHERF-1(-) cells (p < 0.001)21/27PTH1R34.4 ± 3.0 (n = 22)21/2257.4 ± 2.8 (n = 34)aDifferent from NHERF-1(-) cells (p < 0.001),bDifferent from cells expressing M593A-PTH1R or ΔERM-NHERF-1 (p < 0.001)34/34M593A-PTH1R17.4 ± 2.9 (n = 16)12/1617.69 ± 3.0 (n = 12)9/12PTH1R + ΔERM-NHERF-114.5 ± 1.3 (n = 15)8/1512.1 ± 1.4 (n = 39)12/39CaSRNDcND, none detected0/22ND0/19a Different from NHERF-1(-) cells (p < 0.001)b Different from cells expressing M593A-PTH1R or ΔERM-NHERF-1 (p < 0.001)c ND, none detected Open table in a new tab The data shown in Fig. 1 clearly suggested a major difference in the subcellular distributions of the CaSR on one side and the β2AR and the PTH1R on the other. We hypothesized that the differences in the distribution of these receptors were a consequence of the fact that the β2AR and the PTH1R contain a PDZ binding motif at their C terminus, whereas the CaSR does not. Since the PDZ binding motifs of the β2AR and the PTH1R interact with NHERF-1, we proceeded to examine the relevance of these interactions for the stability of the receptor bundles using the PTH1R as a model. CHO-N10 cells were transfected with 1) M593A-PTH1R-eGFP (a PTH1R-eGFP in which the C-terminal methionine has been mutated to alanine, which results in a dramatic reduction of the affinity of the receptor for NHERF-1 (26Sneddon W.B. Magyar C.E. Willick G.E. Syme C.A. Galbiati F. Bisello A. Friedman P.A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2815-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)) or 2) wt-PTH1R-eGFP co-transfected with a deletion mutant of NHERF-1 that does not contain the ERM-binding domain (ΔERM-NHERF-1, which has intact PDZ domains and acts as a dominant negative regarding most of the effects of NHERF-1, primarily because it does not interact with the cytoskeleton (18Sneddon W.B. Syme C.A. Bisello A. Magyar C.E. Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L. Weinman E.J. Abou-Samra A.B. Friedman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43787-43796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)). In both cases, the PTH1R bundles were still present, albeit much less so than in the cells that expressed wt-PTH1R-eGFP alone (Table 1 and Fig. 3, D and E). Thus, the binding of the PTH1R to cytoskeletal fibers is mediated to a significant extent by the interaction of the C terminus of the receptor with specific PDZ domain-containing proteins. NHERF-1 Expression Modulates Receptor Diffusion—We next studied the effects of the cytoskeleton and NHERF-1 expression on PTH1R mobility. Diffusion coefficients were measured using a confocal microscope focused at the plasma membrane closest to the coverslip using FRAP and ICS techniques (Fig. 4). Fig. 4A shows a representative FRAP experiment carried out with cells that do not express NHERF-1. The diffusion coefficients and immobile fractions were calculated for several cells from 5–16 plates for each condition. These results are summarized in Fig. 4B. The diffusion of the PTH1R was significantly slower, and the fraction of immobile receptors was significantly greater in cells that expressed NHERF-1. The results obtained with FRAP and ICS were internally consistent; both methods demonstrated that NHERF-1 significantly decreased the diffusion coefficient and mobile fraction of PTH1R (Fig. 4B). It should be noted that the numbers obtained with ICS and FRAP were not identical. These differences are not unusual and have been attributed to the existence of confinement zones that have a much greater relative influence in the data collected by ICS, because the region imaged is significantly smaller (27Bates I.R.

To demonstrate that the effects of NHERF-1 on receptor mobility were primarily due to the interaction of PTH1R with NHERF-1, we examined the diffusion of M593A-PTH1R. M593A-PTH1R diffused very rapidly in comparison with wt-PTH1R in the presence of NHERF-1 (Fig. 4C). Likewise, wt-PTH1R diffused very rapidly when co-expressed with NHERF-1 mutants that do not bind the receptor (such as S1S2, in which the core binding sequences of the PDZ domains have been scrambled) or that fail to interact with the cytoskeleton (such as ΔERM-NHERF-1) (Fig. 4C). Finally, we examined the role of the cytoskeleton in the lateral mobility of PTH1R (Fig. 4D). Blocking actin polymerization with latrunculin A increased dramatically the diffusion coefficient while decreasing the immobile fraction of wt-PTH1R-eGFP. Interestingly, NHERF-1 decreased the diffusion coefficient of PTH1R in latrunculin A-treated cells, suggesting the presence of a macromolecular complex that includes NHERF-1, PTH1R, and other proteins that may interact with the second PDZ domain or with the ERM binding motif of NHERF-1. These observations demonstrate that the restricted mobility of the PTH1R observed in cells that express NHERF-1 is a consequence of two concomitant phenomena: 1) the interactions of the receptor with NHERF-1 and 2) the interactions of NHERF-1 with the cytoskeleton. Since NHERF-1 also interacts with the β2AR with high affinity, we predic"
https://openalex.org/W2020820932,"Serum response factor (SRF) is a key regulator of smooth muscle differentiation, proliferation, and migration. Myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTFA) is a co-activator of SRF that can induce expression of SRF-dependent, smooth muscle-specific genes and actin/Rho-dependent genes, but not MAPK-regulated growth response genes. How MRTFA and SRF discriminate between these sets of target genes is still unclear. We hypothesized that SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, containing Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1) or Brahma (Brm), may play a role in this process. Results from Western blotting and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that dominant negative Brg1 blocked the ability of MRTFA to induce expression of smooth muscle-specific genes, but not actin/Rho-dependent early response genes, in fibroblasts. In addition, dominant negative Brg1 attenuated expression of smooth muscle-specific genes in primary cultures of smooth muscle cells. MRTFA overexpression did not induce expression of smooth muscle-specific genes in SW13 cells, which lack endogenous Brg1 or Brm. Reintroduction of Brg1 or Brm into SW13 cells restored their responsiveness to MRTFA. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Brg1, SRF, and MRTFA form a complex in vivo, and Brg1 directly binds MRTFA, but not SRF, in vitro. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that dominant negative Brg1 significantly attenuated the ability of MRTFA to increase SRF binding to the promoters of smooth muscle-specific genes, but not early response genes. Together these data suggest that Brg1/Brm containing SWI/SNF complexes play a critical role in regulating expression of SRF/MRTFA-dependent smooth muscle-specific genes but not SRF/MRTFA-dependent early response genes. Serum response factor (SRF) is a key regulator of smooth muscle differentiation, proliferation, and migration. Myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTFA) is a co-activator of SRF that can induce expression of SRF-dependent, smooth muscle-specific genes and actin/Rho-dependent genes, but not MAPK-regulated growth response genes. How MRTFA and SRF discriminate between these sets of target genes is still unclear. We hypothesized that SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, containing Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1) or Brahma (Brm), may play a role in this process. Results from Western blotting and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that dominant negative Brg1 blocked the ability of MRTFA to induce expression of smooth muscle-specific genes, but not actin/Rho-dependent early response genes, in fibroblasts. In addition, dominant negative Brg1 attenuated expression of smooth muscle-specific genes in primary cultures of smooth muscle cells. MRTFA overexpression did not induce expression of smooth muscle-specific genes in SW13 cells, which lack endogenous Brg1 or Brm. Reintroduction of Brg1 or Brm into SW13 cells restored their responsiveness to MRTFA. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Brg1, SRF, and MRTFA form a complex in vivo, and Brg1 directly binds MRTFA, but not SRF, in vitro. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that dominant negative Brg1 significantly attenuated the ability of MRTFA to increase SRF binding to the promoters of smooth muscle-specific genes, but not early response genes. Together these data suggest that Brg1/Brm containing SWI/SNF complexes play a critical role in regulating expression of SRF/MRTFA-dependent smooth muscle-specific genes but not SRF/MRTFA-dependent early response genes. There are many clinical diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension and asthma that involve abnormal differentiation of smooth muscle cells. An important pathological process that occurs in these diseases is the disruption of the balance between differentiation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells (1Glukhova M.A. Kabakov A.E.

The immediate early growth factor responsive genes, such as c-fos and egr1 are regulated by SRF/ELK-1 (ets) complexes (22Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R.

The later early response genes, such as SRF itself and vinculin, that are actin/Rho-dependent, are regulated by SRF-MRTFA complexes (16Cen B. Selvaraj A. Burgess R.C. Hitzler J.K. Ma Z. Morris S.W.

Myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTFA, or Mkl1, MAL, BSAC) is a unique co-activator of SRF in that it is involved in the regulation of multiple SRF-dependent gene families (reviewed in Ref. 27Cen B. Selvaraj A. Prywes R. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 93: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). MRTFA has been reported to induce SRF-dependent, smooth muscle-specific genes such as telokin, SM22α, and SM α-actin and actin/Rho-dependent early response genes, but not proliferation related MAPK-dependent immediate early response genes (13Yoshida T. Gan Q. Shang Y. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C886-C895Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Du K.L. Chen M. Li J. Lepore J.J. Mericko P. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol.

It still remains a mystery how MRTFA can discriminate between different SRF-dependent genes. One possible mechanism could involve gene-specific restriction of promoter access because of chromatin structure. In support of this model, it has been shown that there is very little SRF detectable at the CArG boxes of smooth muscle-specific genes in nonmuscle cells, whereas SRF binding can be readily detected at CArG boxes of early response genes such as c-fos (28McDonald O.G. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 36-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of myocardin in nonmuscle cells was found to lead to increased SRF binding to the promoters of smooth muscle-specific genes. In the current study we provide evidence supporting a role for ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling in regulating SRF binding to CArG boxes within promoters of smooth muscle-specific genes.Because chromatin is highly condensed, the regulation of chromatin accessibility to transcription factors and RNA polymerase is an essential step in gene activation (29Vermaak D. Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Imbalzano A.N. Nat.

Although studies have shown that myocardin can recruit enzymes capable of modifying chromatin structure through covalent modification of histone tails (32Davis C.A. Haberland M.

In addition, the role of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes in the regulation of smooth muscle differentiation is unknown. The SWI/SNF complex is the best characterized, mammalian, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex (30de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Rev. 2006; 7: 461-473Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar). It is comprised of 7–11 components, which assemble into distinct complexes containing either Brg1 (Brahma-related gene 1) or Brm (Brahma) ATPase subunits. SWI/SNF remodeling complexes have been shown to play an essential role in the differentiation of neurons, T cells, erythrocytes, hepatocytes, adipocytes, skeletal, and cardiac muscle cells (34Vradii D.

Although, the role of Brg1 or SWI/SNF in smooth muscle development is largely unknown, Brg1 has been shown to be up-regulated in vascular smooth muscle cells in primary atherosclerosis and in stent stenosis (45Zhang Q.J. Goddard M. Shanahan C. Shapiro L. Bennett M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 2030-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A recent study has also demonstrated that Brg1 binding to CRP2 is critical for induction of smooth muscle-specific genes by CRP2 (18Chang D.F. Belaguli N.S. Chang J. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). During skeletal muscle differentiation it has been shown that the recruitment of Brg1 to MyoD, that is associated with DNA-bound Pbx1, induces chromatin remodeling of the myogenin gene. This facilitates tight binding of MyoD to E boxes resulting in cofactor recruitment and transcription activation (46de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Berkes C.A. Bergstrom D.A. Dacwag C.S. Tapscott S.J. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3997-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). By analogy, we propose that weak SRF binding to the CArG boxes of smooth muscle-specific genes may facilitate recruitment of MRTFA and that interaction of MRTFA with SWI/SNF may then remodel chromatin permitting tight binding of SRF.Results from our study demonstrate that Brg1 is required for the induction of smooth muscle-specific gene expression but not for early response gene expression by MRTFA. Endogenous Brg1, SRF, and MRTFA were found to form a complex in smooth muscle cells and tissue and Brg1 directly bound to MRTFA, but not SRF, in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that SWI/SNF is required for MRTFA to increase SRF binding to the promoters of smooth muscle specific genes. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative Brg1 in differentiated smooth muscle cells attenuated expression of smooth muscle-specific genes. Together these data indicate that SWI/SNF plays a critical role in regulating expression of SRF/MRTFA-dependent smooth muscle-specific genes but not SRF-dependent early response genes. SWI/SNF thus plays an important role in regulating the balance between the differentiation and proliferation roles of SRF.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Adenoviral Transduction—An MRTFA cDNA image clone was purchased from Invitrogen (Clone ID: 682130) and moved to Adeno-X vector according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). Adenovirus encoding nuclear-localized YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) was used as negative control. B22 cells, which are NIH3T3 cells that express a tetracycline inducible dominant-negative Brg1 (DN-Brg1, K798R mutant) (47de La Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Hill D.A. Guidi C.J. Stephenson R.O. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2839-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), were obtained from Dr. Anthony N. Imbalzano (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). By withdrawing tetracycline from the growth media of these cells, the expression of DN-Brg1 can be induced. B22 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Mediatech) containing 2 μg/ml tetracycline, 350 units/ml Hygromycin B, 75 μg/ml G418, and 10% fetal bovine serum. B22 cells were seeded into a 6-well dish at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well in the medium either with or without tetracycline and grown for 24 h prior to adenoviral transduction. Cells were incubated with adenovirus encoding MRTFA or YFP for 4 h at 37 °Cand then replaced with complete medium. 30–48 h after transduction, cells were harvested for protein, RNA, or chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. SW13 and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in high glucose DMEM containing 5 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. 24 h before transduction, SW13 and HeLa cells were seeded at the density of 2.5 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well dish. Cells were then transduced with adenovirus as described above for B22 cells. Primary mouse colon smooth muscle cells were prepared from colons dissected from 4-week-old mice. The epithelial layer was removed, and remaining smooth muscle layer was minced and digested with 1 ml of tissue digestion buffer per organ (0.4 units/ml Blendzyme 3 (Roche Applied Sciences) in DMEM) at 37 °C for 1–2 h with shaking. The digested tissue was then passed through a cell sieve, and the cells collected by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were washed in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin and plated into dishes. After 4–5 days cells reached confluence, were trypsinized, and replated at 7 × 104 per well in 12-well plates. 12 h after plating, cells were transduced by DN-Brg1 or YFP control adenovirus. 72 h after transduction, mRNA was harvested, and the levels of SRF-dependent genes were measured by quantitative real time RT-PCR.Plasmids Used and Cell Transfection—Human Brg1 and Brm cDNA and DN-Brg1 in pBABE retroviral expression plasmids were obtained from AddGene (48Sif S. Saurin A.J. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 603-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). MRTFA was cloned into pcDNA myc/His (Invitrogen) for transfection and in vitro translation experiments. HA-SRF pShuttle was generated by cloning the human SRF cDNA into a modified pShuttle (Clontech) vector that includes an N-terminal HA epitope tag. 12 h prior to transfection, cells were seeded at the density of 2.5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. Plasmids were transfected into cells using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science): cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) then 2 ml of complete medium was added to each well together with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 4 μl of Fugene in 100 μl of DMEM.RNA Analysis—RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 1.2 μg of RNA was used as template for reverse transcription (RT) using Superscript first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). cDNA was dissolved in 20 μl of H2O. The cDNA levels of specific genes were measured by quantitative real time PCR using SYBR green PCR master mix (Invitrogen) and a 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with gene-specific primers (Table S1 in supplemental data). 2 μl of 1:10 diluted cDNA was used for each reaction in 25-μl total volume. All PCR reactions were performed in duplicate.Western Blotting—Protein was extracted with RIPA lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). 30 μg of proteins were fractionated on 7.5 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinyl difluoride membranes. Membranes were then probed with a series of antibodies. Antibodies used for Western blotting were against: Brg1 (Upstate, 1:5,000), Brm (Abcam, 1:1000), MRTFA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-19, 1:500), SRF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, G20X, 1:6,000), β-actin (Sigma, 1:10,000), Egr-1 (Santa Cruz, 1:1,000), FLAG tag (Sigma, M2, 1:5,000), HA tag (Covance, 1:3,000), Myc tag (Invitrogen, 1:1000), MLCK (Sigma, clone K36, 1:10,000), SM α-actin (Sigma, clone 3A1, 1:10,000), SM22α (a gift from Dr. Len Adam, 1:6,000), telokin (1:6,000) (49Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23945-23952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), vinculin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:5,000), NM-MHC IIA (a gift from Dr. Patricia Gallagher). Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using chemiluminescence.Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)—Co-IP assays were performed using a nuclear complex Co-IP kit, essentially as described by the manufacturer (Active Motif). 250 μg of nuclear protein extracts were incubated with 3 μg of anti-Brg1 antibody (Upstate), anti-SRF antibody (G20X), anti-MRTFA antibody (C-19 or ProteinTech), or appropriate IgG control in 500 μl of low salt IP buffer (Active Motif) overnight at 4 °C. 60 μl of EZview protein A beads (Sigma) were added to the mixture and incubated for an additional hour with rocking. Beads were then washed six times with the low salt IP buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved in 35 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, prior to analysis by Western blotting as described as above.In Vitro Transcription/Translation—Synthesis of proteins was carried out in a coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) in vitro, programmed with 1 μg of pShuttle-Brg1 (FLAG tag), pcDNAmyc/his-MRTFA (Myc tag) and pShuttle-SRF (HA tag) plasmids. The TNT products were mixed together as combinations of: SRF with Brg1, MRTFA with Brg1, SRF with MRTFA, in 250 μl of low salt IP buffer (Active Motif). Proteins were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of anti-SRF (G20X) or 15 μl of anti-MRTFA antiserum overnight. A matching rabbit IgG or a MRTFA preimmune serum served as negative controls. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then incubated with EZ-view beads (Sigma) for 2 h. Following six washes with IP buffer, the beads were dissolved in SDS-sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting as described above.Quantitative ChIP Assays—ChIP assays were performed according to the protocol of Upstate with minor modifications. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and harvested using cold phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors. After collecting cells by centrifugation, cell pellets were lysed using 1% SDS lysis buffer (200 μl/1 × 106 cells). For each group, 1 ml of lysate was sonicated for 7 × 30 s at setting 2.25 on a Sonic Dismembranator (Fisher Scientific). 200-μl aliquots of chromatin were immunoprecipitated using 6 μg of anti-SRF antibody (G20X), anti-H3Ac (Upstate), or rabbit IgG as negative control. The precipitated genomic DNA was purified and the presence of specific promoters was measured by real time quantitative PCR, using gene-specific primers (Table S2 in supplemental data).RESULTSDN-Brg1 Inhibits the Ability of MRTFA to Induce Expression of Smooth Muscle-specific Genes, but Not SRF-dependent Early Response Genes—To determine the role of SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling on the induction of genes by SRF/MRTFA, we utilized a previously characterized 3T3 cell line that inducibly expresses a dominant-negative Brg1 (B22 cells, Ref. 47de La Serna I.L.

The dominant-negative K798R mutant Brg1 blocks the function of SWI/SNF complexes containing Brg1 or Brm catalytic subunits.

In contrast, MRTFA did not significantly induce expression of the early response genes, c-fos, egr1, or vinculin, although it did result in a 2-fold increase in expression of SRF mRNA (Fig. 1). As shown by Western blotting (Fig. 2) and more quantitatively by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1) dominant negative Brg-1 significantly abrogated the ability of MRTFA to increase expression of telokin, SM22α, and calponin but not SM α-actin or any of the SRF-dependent early response genes examined. Conversely, DN-Brg1 augmented the ability of MRTFA to increase SRF mRNA expression and increased the basal expression of egr1 and c-fos mRNA (Fig. 1).FIGURE 2The expression of DN-Brg1 in 3T3 fibroblasts interferes with the induction of endogenous SRF-dependent smooth muscle-specific proteins by MRTFA. Inducible DN-Brg1 3T3 (B22) cells were plated in media either with or without tetracycline. 24 h later, cells were transduced with MRTFA or YFP adenovirus. 30–48 h following transduction, cells were lysed using RIPA lysis buffer and protein expression analyzed by Western blotting. 30 μg of protein were loaded in each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MRTFA Cannot Induce Smooth Muscle-specific Genes in SW13 Cells That Lack Brg1 and Brm—It is possible that DN-Brg1 inhibits the activity of more than just Brg1 and Brm containing SWI/SNF complexes, hence we also examined the role of Brg1 in a Brg1/Brm-null cell system. The ability of MRTFA to induce gene expression in human adrenal carcinoma SW13 cells that lack endogenous Brg1/Brm was determined. Human cervical cancer HeLa cells that express Brg1 and Brm were used as control for these experiments. Results from Western blot analysis showed that overexpression of MRTFA in SW13 cells could not induce the expression of most smooth muscle-specific genes, including 130-kDa smMLCK, telokin, or SM22α, and could only weakly induce SM α-actin expression (Fig. 3A). In contrast, MRTFA readily induced expression of all these genes in HeLa cells. MRTFA induced expression of SRF and vinculin in SW13 cells as well as in HeLa cells. Although egr1 was not induced by MRTFA in either of these two cell types, the basal expression of egr1 appeared higher in SW13 cells compared with HeLa cells. Surprisingly, MRTFA was able to induce expression of c-fos in SW13 cells but not in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A), and this induction was attenuated by reintroduction of Brg1 into the SW13 cells (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with the results obtained from the DN-Brg1 3T3 cell lines. To verify that the inability of MRTFA to induce smooth muscle-specific genes in SW13 cells is due to the lack of Brg1/Brm we reintroduced Brg1 or Brm1 back into SW13 cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that restoration of Brg1 or Brm expression could rescue the ability of MRTFA to induce the expression of smooth muscle-specific proteins in SW13 cells (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3MRTFA cannot induce smooth muscle-specific gene expression in SW13 cells that lack Brg1/Brm1.

https://openalex.org/W1978227165,"The signaling mechanisms responsible for BCR/ABL-induced regulation of Mcl-1 expression in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells remain unclear. In this study, we show that BCR/ABL could upregulate sphingosine kinase-1 (SPK1) expression via multiple signal pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), leading to increase cellular SPK1 activity in CML cells. Retrovirus-mediated overexpression of bcr-abl gene in NIH-3T3, Ba/F3 and HL-60 cells results in upregulation and increased cellular activity of SPK1, whereas treatment of CML cells with specific inhibitors of the BCR/ABL, PI3K, MAPK and JAK2 pathways decreases BCR/ABL-induced SPK1 expression and cellular activity. BCR/ABL also induces upregulation of Mcl-1 expression in CML cells. Inhibition of SPK1 by adenovirus-mediated transfer of small interfering RNA or N,N-dimethylsphingosine reduced expression of Mcl-1 in CML cells. Our data indicated that BCR/ABL induces SPK1 expression and increases its cellular activity, leading to upregulation of Mcl-1 in CML cells. SPK1 silencing enhances the STI571-induced apoptosis of CML cell lines. It is suggested that SPK1 may be a potential therapeutic target in CML."

https://openalex.org/W2039705701,"Physiological signalling by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) controls developmental processes and tissue homeostasis, whereas aberrant EGFR activity drives oncogenic cell transformation. Under normal conditions, the EGFR must therefore generate outputs of defined strength and duration. To this aim, cells balance EGFR activity via different modalities of negative signalling. Increasing attention is being drawn on transcriptionally controlled feedback inhibitors of EGFR, namely RALT/MIG6, LRIG1, SOCS4 and SOCS5. Genetic studies in mice have revealed the essential role of Ralt/Mig6 in regulating Egfr-driven skin morphogenesis and tumour formation, yet the mechanisms through which RALT abrogates EGFR activity are still undefined. We report that RALT suppresses EGFR function by inhibiting its catalytic activity. The evolutionarily conserved ErbB-binding region (EBR) is necessary and sufficient to carry out RALT-dependent suppression of EGFR kinase activityin vitro and in intact cells. The mechanism involves binding of the EBR to the 953RYLVIQ958 sequence, which is located in theαI helix of the EGFR kinase and has been shown to participate in allosteric control of EGFR catalytic activity. Our results uncover a novel mechanism of temporal regulation of EGFR activity in vertebrate organisms."

Previous studies have identified the importance of interactions between E2Fs and other transcription factors as a mechanism for transcriptional control of a subset of E2F regulated target genes. However, the mechanisms responsible for E2F target gene specificity remain incompletely understood. Here we report that in a mammalian in vivo model of synchronized proliferation, C/EBPβ occupancy on the promoters of E2F-regulated growth-related genes increases as a function of cell cycle progression. C/EPBβ binding to these promoters is associated with recruitment of the coactivator CBP/p300, histone H4 acetylation, and maximal activation of E2F target genes. Moreover, binding of CBP/p300 to E2F targets is markedly reduced in C/EBPβ null mice, resulting in reduced expression of E2F regulated genes. These findings identify C/EBPβ as a direct activator of E2F target genes in mammalian cell cycle progression through a mechanism that involves recruitment of CBP/p300. The demonstration of a functional link between C/EBPβ and CBP/p300 for E2F target gene activation provides a potential mechanism for how coactivators such as CBP/p300 can be selectively recruited to E2F target genes in response to tissue-specific growth stimuli.

E2F target genes including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and the activator E2F proteins themselves are induced in mid to late G1 phase and are important for the G1/S transition. In G0 and early G1 phase, the promoters of the pro-proliferative E2F genes (E2F1, −2, and −3) are transcriptionally silenced as a result of binding of the repressive E2Fs, a pocket protein such as pRB or p130, and chromatin remodeling proteins (1Frolov M.V.

As cells reenter the cell cycle, sequential activation of cyclin-dependent kinases with their partner cyclins results in phosphorylation of the pocket proteins, relieving the inhibition of activator E2F gene transcription (3Sherr C.

The partial hepatectomy model in rodents has been extensively used to investigate the mechanisms responsible for hepatic growth and proliferation and is one of only a few models for mammalian in vivo cell cycle entry (9Fausto N.

After surgical removal of 70% of the liver, the majority of the remaining, normally quiescent, hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells synchronously reenter the cell cycle and proliferate, restoring the original liver mass in 10–14 days. Immediately after surgery, cytokine and growth factor signals emanating from Kupffer and endothelial cells in the liver rapidly activate a number of transcription factors including NF-κB, STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 3), and C/EBPβ via posttranslational modifications resulting in the transcriptional activation of immediate-early growth genes including myc, fos, and jun (9Fausto N.

Neither hepatoma cells lines nor primary hepatocytes recapitulate the regulatory events and synchronous cell cycle entry and progression that occur in hepatocytes in vivo. The bZIP transcription factors, CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins α and β, regulate diverse functions in the liver and other organs including control of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism (11Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, in the livers of young mice, C/EBPα blocks cell cycle progression of quiescent hepatocytes via inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (12Wang H. Iakova P. Wilde M. Welm A. Goode T. Roesler W.J. Timchenko N.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar).

The importance of C/EBPβ for hepatocyte proliferation is highlighted by the fact that regeneration is impaired in C/EBPβ–/– mice after partial hepatectomy and is associated with a significant reduction in hepatocyte DNA synthesis (16Greenbaum L.E. Li W. Cressman D. Peng Y. Ciliberto G. Poli V. Taub R. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The majority of growth-related genes are not dependent on C/EBPβ with the exception of cyclins including cyclin E, A, and B. Evidence from other experimental systems indicates that cyclins are often regulated by E2Fs. Based on the previously identified regulation of E2F genes by C/EBPα described above, we hypothesized that changes in the occupancy of E2F-dependent promoters by C/EBPα and C/EBPβ could be important for activation of E2F-regulated target genes and provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of C/EBPβ in the cell cycle. Animals—The derivation of mice homozygous for the C/EBPβ mutation has been previously described (16Greenbaum L.E. Li W. Cressman D. Peng Y. Ciliberto G. Poli V. Taub R. J. Clin.

All animal studies were performed in accordance with the University of Pennsylvania animal care committee guidelines (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee). RNA Analysis—Total liver RNA was prepared from wild type and C/EBPβ–/– mice at 0, 16, 24, 40, and 48 h post-partial hepatectomy by guanidine isothiocyanate and cesium chloride ultracentrifugation (23Glisin V.

Oligo-d(T)18 was used for priming. cDNA was diluted 15-fold in H20. 1 μlof diluted cDNA was used as template in quantitative real time PCR analysis using the Brilliant® SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene), 10 μm primers, and the reference dye at a 1:200 dilution according to the manufacturer's instructions using the Mx4000 PCR system (Stratagene). All genes were normalized to TATA box-binding protein and shown as fold induction over wild type 0-h post-partial hepatectomy expression level. Primer sequences are available upon request.

To ensure that salt concentrations were identical across all immunoprecipitations, each 25-μg DNA chromatin sample was brought up to a total volume of 250 μl in nuclear lysis buffer and then diluted 1:1 in ChIP dilution buffer. Adjusted ChIPs were then precleared, immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of antibody or 2 μl of antiserum, and washed as previously described (27Wells J. Graveel C.R. Bartley S.M. Madore S.J. Farnham P.J.

Anti-C/EBPα (sc-61), anti-C/EBPβ (sc-50), anti-E2F1 (sc-193), anti-E2F2 (sc-633), anti-CBP (sc-369), and anti-p300 (sc-585) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-acetyl-histone H4 antiserum (06-866) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-rabbit IgG (100-NC) antibody was purchased from Lab Vision. Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using a QiaQuick® PCR purification kit (Qiagen) in a final elution volume of 60 μl. Purified total input DNA from each chromatin preparation was diluted to a concentration of 5 ng/ml to be used as control template in all conventional and quantitative PCR analyses. Conventional PCR analysis was performed by amplifying 1 μl of immunoprecipitated DNA or 1 μl of diluted total input DNA for 35 cycles. 10 μl of each PCR reaction was run on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide or SYBR green (Sigma). All reactions were performed with at least three biological replicates. Primer sequences are available upon request. Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using the Brilliant® SYBR Green QPCR master Mix, 10 μm primers, and the reference dye at a 1:200 dilution according to manufacturer's instructions using the Mx4000 PCR system. 1 or 2 μl (E2F1 only) of immunoprecipitated DNA or diluted total input DNA was used in each reaction. All reactions were performed with two to five biological replicates and three technical replicates with reference dye normalization. The median cycle threshold (Ct) value was used for analysis. ChIP QPCR reactions were normalized to total input by expressing the ChIPs as a percentage of the -fold differential between Input and immunoprecipitation (IP) for the test gene normalized to the -fold differential between Input and IP for 28 S ribosomal control gene. The following formula was used to make this calculation: IP signal = 2((28S gene – test gene) – (input 28S gene – input test gene)). Plasmid Constructs—pcDNA3-LAP and pcDNA3-E2F-1 encoding full-length rat C/EBPβ and E2F-1 coding regions were gifts from Dr. David T. Kurtz, Medical College of South Carolina (13Slomiany B.A. D'Arigo K.L. Kelly M.M. Kurtz D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5986-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). pCMV-CBP-HA expression plasmid was obtained from Richard Goodman. Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3-LAP, pcDNA3-E2F1, pcDNA3-CBP, singly and in combination using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For single and double transfections, pcDNA3 backbone plasmid was added to maintain equal amounts of transfected plasmid DNA per 60-mm plate. Twenty-four hours post-transfection cells were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Cell lysates were sonicated on high setting using the BioRuptor (Diogene) for three 30-s pulses, and debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. Lysates were then precleared with protein G-agarose and directly subjected to immunoprecipitation (see below). Preparation of Cell Lysates from Mouse Liver—Livers were removed from C/EBPβ+/+ and C/EBPβ–/– mice 40 h posthepatectomy, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and resuspended using a Dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm NaF, 7.5 mm EGTA pH 8.0, 7.5 mm MgCl2) to which protease inhibitor mixture was added (Sigma). Immunoblot Analysis—A portion of lysates obtained from each transfection condition or regenerating liver lysates was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Billerica MA). Membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 3 h at room temperature. Incubation with anti-C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz, sc-50, 1:1000), E2F1, (Santa Cruz, sc-193, 1:1000), CBP (Santa Cruz, sc-369, 1:1000) was performed overnight in PBS-T supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk. Horseradish-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:10,000) were used to detect antibody-antigen complexes by chemiluminescence (Lumi-Light PLUS Western blotting Substrate, Roche Diagnostics). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed with protein G-agarose (Invitrogen). In brief, 500 μg of either cell extracts or 2 mg of 40-h posthepatectomy liver lysate were pre-cleared and then incubated with 1 μg of one of the following antibodies: C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz, sc-50), E2F1 (Santa Cruz, sc-193), IgG (Neomarkers, NC-100-P1), or 2 μg of CBP (Santa Cruz, sc-369). For detection of endogenous C/EBPβ-E2F interactions in liver lysates, immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and immunoblotted as described above (immunoblot analysis). Statistical Analysis—Student's t test with equal variance and two-tailed distribution was used to determine the significance of differences between groups (Microsoft Excel statistical analysis software, Redmond, WA). Results where indicated are expressed as means ± S.E. To identify the C/EBPβ-dependent E2F target genes that are responsible for the defect in DNA synthesis in C/EBPβ–/– livers, we assessed the expression of 40 E2F target genes previously implicated in either the G1/S transition, DNA replication, or DNA repair (28Iwanaga R.

Activation of eight E2F-regulated target genes encoding proteins involved in the licensing of DNA replication, (mcm3, cdc6, cdt1, cdc45L), DNA mismatch repair (msh2 and msh5), and the G1/S transition (cdc25b, cdc25c), was reduced in C/EBPβ–/– livers posthepatectomy (Fig. 1 and Table 1). E2F-mediated activation of DNA replication licensing factors has particular relevance to normally quiescent cells such as hepatocytes that must be induced to reenter the cell cycle in response to a growth stimulus. In continuously cycling cells the activity of these proteins is regulated primarily by changes in their activity and/or chromatin occupancy (34Blow J.J. Dutta A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 35Takeda D.Y. Dutta A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2827-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, in quiescent cells these proteins are degraded completely, presumably as an additional barrier to prevent cells from entering the cell cycle inappropriately (36Williams G.H. Romanowski P.

As a result quiescent cells are highly dependent upon de novo transcription of DNA replication licensing factors by E2F regulatory pathways. Therefore, decreased expression of these factors likely contributes to the impaired DNA synthesis in C/EBPβ–/– livers posthepatectomy, providing a mechanistic explanation for the C/EBPβ–/– phenotype (37Pelizon C.

Gorrini C. Frank S.R. Parisi T. Fuchs M. Chan H.-M. Livingston D.M. Amati B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4546-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether C/EBPβ was important for histone acetylation of E2F target genes during the hepatic cell cycle. ChIP was performed on four of the C/EBPβ-dependent E2F genes identified in Table 1 (mcm3, cdc6, msh2, and msh5), and occupancy of acetylated histones on their promoters was determined by quantitative PCR. Although there was no significant induction of histone H3 acetylation of these E2F-regulated promoters during liver regeneration (data not shown), acetylated histone H4 binding was increased 40 h posthepatectomy. Histone H4 acetylation was reduced ∼2-fold in C/EBPβ–/– livers (Fig. 2), in close correlation to the attenuated mRNA expression of E2F targets in the C/EBPβ–/– livers 40 h posthepatectomy (See Fig. 1). We next investigated whether C/EBPβ directly activates these E2F-dependent genes. To test the antibodies against C/EBPβ, we first performed ChIP assays with primers for the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pck1) promoter, a well known C/EBP target (42Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J.D. Shuman J. Friedman A. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6264-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that C/EBPβ occupancy is abolished in C/EBPβ–/– livers as expected. Quantitative real time PCR analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitated from wild type and C/EBPβ–/– livers during quiescence and 40 h posthepatectomy was used to examine C/EBPβ binding to cdc6, mcm3, msh2, and msh5 promoters (Fig. 3, A–E) and to a negative control promoter hprt (Fig. 3F). In wild type livers, C/EBPβ occupancy was detected at both 0 and 40 h posthepatectomy, with C/EBPβ occupancy increased about 2–3-fold at the 40h time point on cdc6 and mcm3 promoters. This increase in C/EBPβ recruitment to these E2F-regulated gene promoters corresponds to both the peak of DNA synthesis during liver regeneration (16Greenbaum L.E. Li W. Cressman D. Peng Y. Ciliberto G. Poli V. Taub R. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and the peak of E2F regulated gene transcription in wild type animals (Fig. 1). In contrast, C/EBPβ occupancy on the msh2 and msh5 promoters was similar at both 0h and 40h posthepatectomy, suggesting that posttranslational modifications of C/EBPβ and/or recruitment of other transcription factors contribute to activation of these genes by C/EBPβ. We considered the possibility that unopposed action of C/EBPα in C/EBPβ–/– hepatocytes could prolong C/EBPα occupancy on the cdc6 and mcm3 promoters posthepatectomy, producing the delay in cell cycle progression that occurs in these mice. However, C/EBPα binding was not increased on the cdc6 and mcm3 promoters in C/EBPβ–/– livers 40 h posthepatectomy relative to wild type livers (Fig. 3A and supplementary Fig. 1). Taken together these data suggest that C/EBPβ regulates E2F gene activation in the regenerating liver through a mechanism that involves binding to E2F target gene promoters. The transcriptional coactivator proteins CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300 enhance transcription of target promoters (43Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPβ binds to the adenovirus E1A-interacting domain of CBP and p300, and recruitment of CBP or p300 by C/EBPβ to promoters leads to co-activator phosphorylation and enhanced transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ target genes (44Kovacs K.A.

Schmolke M. Budde B. Wenning D. Kelpnauer K.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recruitment of CBP/p300 to E2F target gene promoters has been implicated in transcriptional activation and cell cycle progression (46Morris L. Allen K.E. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 47Caretti G. Salsi V. Vecchi C. Imbriano C. Mantovani R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30435-30440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have demonstrated that CBP and p300 can bind to either C/EBPβ or E2Fs, it has not been established whether C/EBPβ binds to E2Fs or if all three proteins form a complex. To investigate these possibilities, C/EBPβ, CBP, and E2F1 were expressed in HEK 293 cells, immunoprecipitated with CBP or E2F1 antibodies, and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, CBP is able to associate with E2F1 and C/EBPβ consistent with previously published reports demonstrating CBP/E2F1 (46Morris L. Allen K.E. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and CBP/C/EBPβ (45Schwartz C. Beck K. Mink S. Schmolke M. Budde B. Wenning D. Kelpnauer K.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) interaction. Our ability to detect immunoprecipitate E2F1 and C/EBPβ in the absence of transfected CBP (Fig. 4) most likely reflects the presence of endogenous CBP protein in 293 cells, which has been described previously (48Lill N.L. Grossman D. Ginsberg D. DeCaproi J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We consistently detect decreased amounts of co-immunoprecipitated E2F1 protein when all three proteins were ectopically expressed when compared with transfection of CBP and E2F1. Triple-transfected 293 cells grew more slowly, suggesting that there may have been cellular toxicity that influenced the efficiency of the coimmunoprecipitation and/or protein expression levels. Immunoprecipitation with α-E2F1 (Fig. 4, panel B) demonstrates that C/EBPβ interacts with E2F1. Taken together, these findings suggest that CBP, E2F1, and C/EBPβ have the potential to form a complex in vivo. In addition, α-E2F1 specifically immunoprecipitated endogenous C/EBPβ pr"

To suppress this antiapoptotic function of NF-κB might be a promising strategy to increase susceptibility of tumor cells to stress-induced cell death. We have recently shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α induces caspase-dependent and -independent JNK activation and ROS accumulation in cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-Flip)−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). To apply this observation to tumor therapy, we knocked down c-FLIP by RNA interference in various tumor cells. Consistent with the results using c-Flip−/− MEFs, we found that TNFα stimulation induced caspase-dependent prolonged JNK activation and ROS accumulation, followed by apoptotic and necrotic cell death in various tumor cells. Furthermore, TNFα and Fas induced the cleavage of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase (MEKK)1, resulting in generation of a constitutive active form of MEKK1 leading to JNK activation in c-FLIP knockdown cells. Given that ROS accumulation and necrotic cell death enhance inflammation followed by compensatory proliferation of tumor cells, selective suppression of caspase-dependent ROS accumulation will be an alternative strategy to protect cells from ROS-dependent DNA damage and compensatory tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2021638455,"CmtR from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a winged helical DNA-binding repressor of the ArsR-SmtB metal-sensing family that senses cadmium and lead. Cadmium-CmtR is a dimer with the metal bound to Cys-102 from the C-terminal region of one subunit and two Cys associated with helix αR from the other subunit, forming a symmetrical pair of cadmium-binding sites. This is a significant novelty in the ArsR-SmtB family. The structure of the dimer could be solved at 312 K. The apoprotein at the same temperature is still a dimer, but it experiences a large conformational exchange at the dimer interface and within each monomer. This is monitored by an overall decrease of the number of nuclear Overhauser effects and by an increase of H2O-D2O exchange rates, especially at the dimeric interface, in the apo form with respect to the cadmium-bound state. The C-terminal tail region is completely unstructured in both apo and cadmium forms but becomes less mobile in the cadmium-bound protein due to the recruitment of Cys-102 as a metal-ligand. DNA binds to the apo dimer with a ratio 1:3 at millimolar concentration. Addition of cadmium to the apo-CmtR-DNA complex causes DNA detachment, restoring the NMR spectrum of free cadmium-CmtR.

These are a subgroup of winged helix repressors. We previously discovered the cellular zinc sensor SmtB (5Huckle J.W. Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Robinson N.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In elevated zinc, SmtB repression of the smtA gene is alleviated to allow transcription of a metallothionein gene encoding a protein, which sequesters the surplus metal atoms (9Turner J.S. Morby A.P.

There is considerable interest in understanding how metal binding to metal sensors is transduced into altered levels of transcription of their target genes. Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains ten genes encoding ArsR/SmtB sensors making it a useful model organism for studies of these regulators. It is plausible that fluctuations in metal concentrations within macrophages have selected for multiple genes encoding such regulators in this pathogen. One of the M. tuberculosis sensors, CmtR, was chosen for structural and functional studies of a sensory mechanism. We previously established that CmtR responds in vivo to cadmium and lead to modulate production of a toxic metal-exporting P1-type ATPase (16Cavet J.S. Graham A.I. Meng W. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44560-44566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Residues Cys-57 and Cys-61 plus Cys-102 have been implicated in cadmium perception by a combination of in vivo and in vitro studies (16Cavet J.S. Graham A.I. Meng W. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44560-44566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Wang Y. Hemmingsen L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8976-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CmtR has a relatively weak affinity for DNA, in the region of 10-7 m, even in the apo form (22Sambrook J.R. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). Here we report a solution NMR investigation of both the demetallated and metallated proteins. We show that the former has a tertiary and quaternary structure that is fluxional, whereas the latter has a more rigid conformation with implications for the metal-sensing mechanism. This is a typical example of a system, which can be tackled by NMR as mobile proteins generally do not crystallize or do so via selection of a single conformer. Additionally, we visualize cadmium inhibition of CmtR DNA binding by NMR. CmtR Expression and Purification—β-Galactosidase activity was measured in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 cells containing cmtR, or derivatives with codon substitutions at Cys-57, Cys-61, Cys-102, Asp-79, or His-81, fused to lacZ in pJEM15 (16Cavet J.S. Graham A.I. Meng W. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44560-44566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking in LB medium containing 0.05% Tween 80 (v/v) and supplemented with CdCl2 up to maximum non-inhibitory concentrations (7.5 μm) for 20 h immediately prior to assay. Assays were performed in triplicate on at least three separate occasions. CmtR was expressed for purification as previously described (16Cavet J.S. Graham A.I. Meng W. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44560-44566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Crude cell lysates were applied to a Heparin affinity column pre-equilibrated in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient to 1 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing CmtR were loaded onto a Superdex-75 size-exclusion column equilibrated in buffer A plus 200 mm NaCl. CmtR-containing fractions were pooled and diluted to reduce salt concentration before a single concentration step on a second heparin affinity column. Protein was judged to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. For production of dual-labeled CmtR for NMR analysis, Escherichia coli BL21 harboring the pET-CmtR expression plasmid, was cultured in M9 minimal media (22Sambrook J.R. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). d-Glucose-13C6 and ammonium-15N chloride were used. Cultures were grown until A595 = 0.6, and expression was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm for 6.5 h. Labeled CmtR was purified and concentrated as described for unlabeled protein. Prior to use in experiments, CmtR was desalted by multiple passages through a PD-10 column filled with Sephadex G-25 resin and equilibrated in the required buffer. Protein concentration was calculated using the theoretical extinction coefficient (at 280 nm) of 4,400 m-1 cm-1. Mass Spectrometry—CmtR was desalted into 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.0). 3-fold excess cadmium was added as required. Mass spectroscopy was carried out on a Thermo Finnigan LTQ-MS. Protein was present at ∼5 pmol μl-1. Spectral Analysis of CmtR Metal Binding—Purified protein was desalted into 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 250 mm KCl buffer in an anaerobic environment. Protein was diluted to the required concentration and sealed in a gas-tight quartz cuvette. Spectra were measured from 200 to 800 nm on a Cary 4E spectrophotometer. Metals were added to the indicated concentrations using a gas-tight Hamilton syringe, allowed to equilibrate for 60 s before reading the spectra. NMR Structural and Dynamic Characterization—In the NMR samples, the final protein concentration ranges between 0.5 and 1 mm. NMR samples also contained 10% v/v 2H2O for NMR spectrometer lock. The NMR spectra were acquired on 15N- and 13C,15N-labeled apo-CmtR and cadmium-CmtR samples at 298 K and 312 K on Avance 800 and 500 Bruker spectrometers equipped with triple resonance Cryoprobes™. The NMR experiments of cadmium- and apo-CmtR, used for the backbone and the aliphatic side-chain resonance assignment and for obtaining structural restraints, are summarized in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Resonance assignments of cadmium- and apo-CmtR have been deposited in the BioMagResBank data base and are also reported with details in supplemental Tables S3 and S4.

Torchia D.A. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Secondary structure elements of apo- and cadmium-CmtR were determined from chemical shift index analysis on Hα, CO, Cα, and Cβ resonances, 3JHNHα coupling constants, dαN(i-1,i)/dNα(i,i) ratios (24Gagne R.R. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and NOE patterns. Structure calculations were performed using the program CYANA 2.1 (25Guntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). The CANDID module of CYANA was used for automated assignment of the NOESY cross-peaks, followed by a manual check prior to the final calculations. All the details for structure calculations of the monomer and of the dimer are reported in supplemental Table S5, which also reports the statistical and quality analysis of the water-energy-minimized structures of cadmium-CmtR. By analyzing three-dimensional 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY spectra and two-dimensional NOESY spectra, 3056 intra-subunit NOE cross-peaks are assigned and transformed into 2445 unique upper distance limits, of which 1809 are meaningful. The average number of meaningful NOEs per residue is 16. The presence of 34 NOEs, inconsistent with proton couplings of residues of the same subunit, were identified and assigned to intersubunit couplings (supplemental Table S6) and introduced in the dimeric structure calculations. Distance and dihedral angle restraints and proton pairs stereospecifically assigned were duplicated for each subunit in the dimer structure calculations. To improve the treatment of symmetric dimer structures we have used new types of restraints that have been recently introduced in the program CYANA 2.1, i.e. identity restraints and symmetry restraints (25Guntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Cadmium was included in the calculations by adding a chain of dummy atoms to the amino acid sequence that have their van der Waals radii set to 0 with the end one atom having a radius of 1.4 Å, which mimics a cadmium ion. The sulfur atoms of the Cys ligands were linked to the metal ion through upper distance limits of 2.3 Å. Structure calculations were performed by first considering the sulfurs of Cys-57 and Cys-61 as metal donor atoms and then including a third sulfur deriving from Cys-102. When Cys-102 comes from the same subunit, the target function drastically increases, whereas when Cys-102 is absent or provided by the other subunit, the target function does not change. Therefore, the third Cys ligand must exclusively come from the C-terminal tail of the adjacent subunit. The thirty conformers with the lowest residual CYANA target function values, out of 300 starting conformers used in this final calculation, were restrained energy-minimized using the AMBER 8 package. 3D.

The force field parameters for the cadmium ion were adapted from those already reported for similar cadmium sites in cadmium proteins (27Arseniev A. Schultze P. Wörgötter E. Braun W. Wagner G.

The quality of the structure was evaluated in terms of deviations from ideal bond lengths and bond angles and through Ramachandran plots obtained using the programs PROCHECK-NMR and WHAT IF (28Vriend G. J. Mol. Graphics. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar, 29Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

The solution structure of cadmium-CmtR has been deposited in the PDB (2JSC). 15N R1, R2, and steady-state heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOEs, which can provide information on internal mobility as well as on the overall protein tumbling rate, were measured with pulse sequences described (30Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) on both apo-CmtR and cadmium-CmtR samples. In all experiments the water signal was suppressed with the “water flipback” scheme (31Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). The experimental relaxation rates were used to map the spectral density function values, J(ωH), J(ωN), and J(0), as described elsewhere (32Peng J.W. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 308-332Google Scholar). The overall rotational correlation time (τm) values were estimated from the R2/R1 ratio. In this analysis, care was taken to remove from the input relaxation data those amide protons having an exchange contribution to the R2 value or exhibiting large-amplitude internal motions on a time scale longer than a few hundred picoseconds as inclusion of these data would bias the calculated τm value (33Tjandra N. Feller S.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12562-12566Crossref Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The kinetics of H2O-D2O exchange were performed diluting concentrated apo- and cadmium-CmtR proteins rapidly with 2H2O to a final concentration of 92% (v/v). Hydrogen/deuterium exchange rates were investigated through a series of 1H-15N HSQC experiments performed over 24 h. Interaction of CmtR-DNA Complexes with Metals—Complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to the previously determined CmtR-binding site (5′-GCTGTTATACCAGTATATGGTGTACTATTTGATCT-3′) were synthesized. Oligonucleotides were annealed, resuspended in H2O, and subjected to ultracentrifugation in an Airfuge prior to use. The protein-DNA interaction was followed by NMR applying 1H-15N TROSY and CRINEPT techniques (34Riek R. Pervushin K. Wüthrich K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 462-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). First, the DNA fragment was stepwise added to a solution of 0.1 mm dimeric 15N apo-CmtR in 50 mm phosphate (pH 7) and 0.4 m NaCl buffer. The final dimeric protein:DNA ratio was 3:1 with 1 mm dithiothreitol. An aqueous solution of CdCl2 was then stepwise added to the DNA-protein mixture up to 1:1 metal:dimeric protein ratio. Second, the DNA fragment was stepwise added to a solution of 0.15 mm dimeric 15N cadmium-CmtR in 50 mm phosphate (pH 7) and 0.4 m NaCl buffer. The final dimeric protein:DNA ratio was 1:3 with 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein Characterization—CmtR is a cadmium-detecting transcriptional repressor of 118 residues with a molecular mass of 12.5 kDa that forms homodimers (21Wang Y. Hemmingsen L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8976-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). IC-mass spectrometry shows that cadmium-CmtR has a mass of 25,211 under native conditions with volatile buffers, matching a dimer plus two cadmium atoms. The far-UV CD spectra of apo- and cadmium-CmtR have features characteristic of a folded protein with a large content of α-helices, as indicated by two negative bands at 222 and 209 nm. The peak intensity as well as the overall shape of the CD spectrum of apo-CmtR does not change upon addition of 1 equivalent of CdCl2 per monomer, indicating that the binding of metal does not affect the content of secondary structure. The 1H-15N HSQC spectra of apo- and cadmium-CmtR recorded at 298 K are indicative of an essentially folded protein with well dispersed amide signals. However, at this temperature only 60 and 80 NH signals for apo- and cadmium-CmtR, respectively, versus 114 expected resonances, were observed. Moreover, the majority of the detected signals were too broad to proceed with a high resolution structure determination. By increasing the temperature to 312 K, the NH signals significantly narrowed in both apo- and cadmium-CmtR (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2), and the number of detected NH signals increased to 89 and 97, respectively. The missing amide resonances are essentially located in the N-terminal region. The overall molecular tumbling rates (14.4 ± 1.7 ns for apo-CmtR and 14.9 ± 1.3 for cadmium-CmtR, respectively, at 312 K) as obtained from 15N relaxation measurements (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4) show that the protein in solution is in a dimeric state both with and without the metal ion. The 15N relaxation measurements do not show evidence of any conformational equilibria, because they can be revealed only at rates smaller than 105 s-1. However, evidence of conformational line-broadening occurs at 298 K as the number of peaks increase with increasing temperature. Only one set of resonances was observed in the NMR spectra of both apo- and cadmium-CmtR, indicating that dimer subunits interact on average in a symmetric way to produce degenerate resonances for both molecules. Solution Structure of Cadmium-CmtR—The solution structure of cadmium-CmtR was solved using 2445 unique upper distance limits obtained from three-dimensional 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY spectra and two-dimensional NOESY spectra. Each subunit of the symmetric dimer is composed of five α-helices (residues 12-18, 21-32, 39-44, 49-61, and 79-87) and a two-stranded β-sheet (residues 63-68 and 73-77) arranged into an α1-α2-α3-αR-β1-β2-α5-fold (where αR represents the DNA recognition helix, following the notation used for SmtB) (Fig. 1A) with similarity to the global folds of SmtB, CzrA, and CadC (13Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Eicken C. Pennella M.A. Chen X. Koshlap K.M. VanZile M.L. Sacchettini J.C. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Ye J. Kandegedara A. Martin P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4214-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Helices α3 and αR (segments 39-44 and 49-61) form the standard helix-turn-helix motif found in many DNA-binding proteins (35Aravind L. Anantharaman V. Balaji S. Babu M.M. Iyer L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 231-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other three helices are involved in several hydrophobic interactions within each monomer and serve primarily as a scaffold that orients the helix-turn-helix motif. Furthermore, helices α1 and α5 form hydrophobic interactions at the dimer interface. The structure is well defined over the whole sequence (supplemental Fig. S5) with the exception of the C- and N-terminal regions, the latter of which is a consequence of the lack of the detection of resonances for the first ten amino acids. The NH cross-peaks of the C-terminal region (residues 106-118) are all clustered in the typical spectral region of unstructured proteins and are highly flexible, displaying backbone mobility in the nanosecond to picosecond time scale, considerably faster than the overall protein tumbling rate (supplemental Fig. S4). Consequently this region is characterized by a very low number of long range NOEs (supplemental Fig. S5). A total of 34 unambiguously assigned intersubunit NOEs per chain, mainly involving helices α1 and α5, define the dimeric interface in cadmium-CmtR and unambiguously orient the CmtR subunits in dimer structure calculations (Figs. 1A and 2A). Helices α1 and α5 are adjacent and antiparallel to the corresponding helices from the other subunit. The cadmium-CmtR structure shows that Cys-57 and Cys-61 are on helix αR and in the following loop, respectively, in an appropriate conformation to bind the cadmium ion. The backbone chemical shift changes between apo- and cadmium-CmtR reveals four regions affected by cadmium-binding; (i) α1 plus the following loop and (ii) α5 helices, all at the dimer interface, (iii) part of αR, including Cys-57 and Cys-61, and (iv) the segment 97-102 containing Cys-102 (Fig. 2B). 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts of cysteines 57, 61, and 102 are the most affected by cadmium binding, with the chemical shift differences ranging from 1.3 to 5.0 ppm for 13Cα and from 1.2 to 3.0 ppm for the 13Cβ. Cadmium binding also reduces the backbone flexibility of the region containing Cys-102 (see later). All of these data are therefore in agreement with direct participation of Cys-102 in metal binding. Structural calculations are consistent with a cadmium-binding site composed of αR-associated residues Cys-57, Cys-61, plus Cys-102 of the complementary molecule of the dimer (Fig. 1A). Our results are therefore consistent with our previous in vivo data (16Cavet J.S. Graham A.I. Meng W. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44560-44566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) plus in vitro evidence (21Wang Y. Hemmingsen L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8976-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) implicating Cys-57 and Cys-61 associated with helix αR, plus Cys-102 from the flexible tail, in inducer recognition. The cadmium to sulfur charge transfer band is still observed in our spectra of a C102S mutant, indicative of retention of cadmium binding (supplemental Fig. S6). Although Cys-57 and Cys-61 thiols are required for CmtR to bind cadmium in vitro, the Cys-102 thiol is not, with loss of this side group only reducing the cadmium-affinity by one order of magnitude (21Wang Y. Hemmingsen L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8976-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus the Cys-102 thiol presumably is an obligatory ligand for the molecular mechanism but optional for cadmium binding. This implies that binding across the dimeric interface is critical for allostery. Structures of SmtB and CzrA (13Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Eicken C. Pennella M.A. Chen X. Koshlap K.M. VanZile M.L. Sacchettini J.C. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have visualized a pair of tetradentate zinc-sensing sites at C-terminal α5 helices, but CmtR has only two (Asp-79 and His-81) potential ligands aligning with those of SmtB and CzrA. When expression from the cmt operator-promoter was examined in response to a range of cadmium concentrations in mycobacterial cells containing CmtR mutants it confirmed that Cys-57, Cys-61, or Cys-102 to Ser substitutions rendered the protein fully inducer non-responsive at any cadmium concentration (supplemental Fig. S7). This is consistent with our previous studies of these mutants at a single metal concentration (16Cavet J.S. Graham A.I. Meng W. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44560-44566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and with the sensory site shown in Fig. 3. Substitutions at Asp-79 and His-81 do not abolish inducer recognition, although they do lessen inducer-mediated de-repression (supplemental Fig. S7). These substitutions do not impair CmtR-mediated repression in vivo (supplemental Fig. S7), unlike the elevated constitutive expression detected in cells containing non-functional CmtR mutants (16Cavet J.S. Graham A.I. Meng W. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44560-44566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), confirming that they form stable, folded, and fully functional repressors analogous to the wild type. Investigation of the protonation state of His-81, performed through detection of 2J 1H-15N couplings, indicates that His-81 exists as an imidizolium in cadmium-CmtR (supplemental Fig. S6) and consequently is not involved in cadmium binding. It is indeed involved in hydrogen bond interactions with Asp-79 of the same subunit and Gln-91 of the other subunit, thus contributing to the stabilization of the dimer interface. In particular, an intramolecular hydrogen-bond between the backbone NH of His-81 and the carboxyl oxygen of Asp-79 is present in more than 25 conformers out of 30 final energy-minimized structures, whereas Hδ1 of His-81 forms an intermolecular hydrogen bond with Oϵ1 of Gln-91 in half of the conformers. The H-bond interactions are further supported by the detection of intersubunit NOEs between the Hδ2 and Hϵ1 of His-81 and the Hϵ22 and Hϵ21 of Gln-91 in the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum. Characterization of Apo-CmtR—Analysis of the chemical shift index of Cα, CO, and Cβ resonances of apo-CmtR (supplemental Table S4) shows that the protein maintains the same secondary structure elements as cadmium-CmtR, consistent with the CD spectra. The NOESY spectra show less than half of the cross-peaks relative to the cadmium derivative, and in general they display lower intensity. After a thorough resonance assignment, it appears that mainly the long range NOEs are lacking even within the secondary structure elements and, dramatically, in the inter-subunit helices α1 and α5. Particularly, only five intersubunit NOEs are observed at the protein interface, compared with 34 in the cadmium derivative. The few observed NOEs of apo-CmtR are consistent with the"

In the course of a program to screen a panel of oral squamous-cell carcinoma (OSCC), cell lines for genomic copy-number aberrations by array-CGH using our in-house arrays, we identified a 3-Mb homozygous deletion at 10p12 in 1 of 18 cell lines (5.6%). Among seven genes located within this region, expression of PRTFDC1 mRNA was not detected in 50% (9/18) or decreased in 5.6% (1/18) of OSCC cell lines, but detected in normal oral epithelia and restored in gene-silenced OSCC cells without its homozygous loss after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Among 17 cell lines without a homozygous deletion, the hypermethylation of the PRTFDC1 CpG island, which showed promoter activity, was observed in all nine cell lines with no or reduced PRTFDC1 expression (52.9%). Methylation of this CpG island was also observed in primary OSCC tissues (8/47, 17.0%). In addition, restoration of PRTFDC1 in OSCC cells lacking its expression inhibited cell growth in colony-formation assays, whereas knockdown of PRTFDC1 expression in OSCC cells expressing the gene promoted cell growth. These results suggest that epigenetic silencing of PRTFDC1 by hypermethylation of the CpG island leads to a loss of PRTFDC1 function, which might be involved in squamous cell oral carcinogenesis."

CD4-mediated binding was also associated with a significantly elevated proportion of ruptured viruses. The ratio of inactivated to CD4-liganded gp120-gp41 spikes can be much greater than 1:1, because all gp120-gp41 spikes on the closely apposed surfaces of cross-linked viruses should be incapable of accessing the target cell surface and mediating entry, as a result of inter-virus spike cross-linking.

However, the large mass of D1D2-IgP is also a disadvantage, as it would likely result in undesirable pharmacologic properties such as poor distribution and immunogenicity. Here, we undertook to understand the structural basis of D1D2-IgP neutralization of HIV using cryoelectron tomography and solution atomic force microscopy (AFM) in order to inform rational design of therapeutic agents that block gp120-CD4 binding and that possess both desirable pharmacologic properties and key structural determinants of potency.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification-D1D2-IgP was expressed and purified as described (12Arthos J.

Briefly, the published procedure was followed by fractionation over a Superose 6 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS), and the peak fraction was collected.

Grids were imaged at liquid nitrogen temperatures and 6-μm defocus, ×34,000 magnification, using a Polara field emission gun electron microscope (FEI Co.) operated at 300 kV, equipped with a GIF 2000 2K × 2K CCD camera placed at the end of a Gatan energy filter (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA). Isolated D1D2-IgP, immunoaffinity-purified human IgM (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Waltham, MA), or MICA-IgP were imaged in the same way except that holey carbon grids were used. All tilt series for tomographic reconstruction were acquired using the FEI tomography software package Xplore3D in the range ± 70°, using the Saxton tilt scheme with 3° initial tilt increment, aligned without fiducial markers using Protomo (18Winkler H. Taylor K.A.

Visualization was carried out using software tools implemented in the program Amira (TGS, San Diego, CA).Solution Atomic Force Microscopy-A solution of D1D2-IgP, IgM, or MICA-IgP in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, was deposited on freshly cleaved mica coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma), incubated for 15 min, rinsed three times with TBS, and imaged in TBS in tapping mode on a Digital Instruments MultiMode atomic force microscope (Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA) with a Veeco NP-S scanning probe.Air Atomic Force Microscopy-An IgM solution of 3.3 μg/ml protein in 50 μl of TBS was incubated on poly-l-lysine-coated mica for 2 min at room temperature, followed by rinsing with 2 ml of 0.1× TBS and drying under nitrogen. A D1D2-IgP solution of 4.73 μg/ml protein in 50 μl of TBS was incubated on poly-l-lysine-coated mica at room temperature for 10 min, followed by rinsing with 10 ml of Milli-Q water and drying under nitrogen. Uranyl acetate pretreatment was performed by incubation of 50 μl of protein in TBS on freshly cleaved mica for 2 min at room temperature, followed by rinsing twice with 1 ml of 0.1× TBS. This was followed by mixing of the meniscus with 100 μl of 1% uranyl acetate. The sample was dried to a thin film by application of the inverted sample to a piece of filter paper, followed by drying under nitrogen. Images were acquired in air tapping mode on a Digital Instruments MultiMode atomic force microscope (Veeco) with a SuperSharp silicon scanning probe (NanoSensors, Neuchatel, Switzerland).RESULTSD1D2-IgP is a multimeric CD4-immunoglobulin fusion construct with exemplary neutralization activity against primary isolates of HIV-1 (6Kwong P.D.

We imaged the three-dimensional structure of individual unfixed, unstained D1D2-IgP particles in vitreous ice using cryoelectron tomography. As shown in tomographic slices and threshold segmentations of selected molecules (Fig. 1A, Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Movie M1), D1D2-IgP particles ranged in width from 20–35 nm, with an average diameter of ∼25 nm. Inspection of the three-dimensional structures shows that the putative Ig2(CD4)2 units, or arms, are flexible, neither arranged in a radial pattern nor largely confined to an annulus (Fig. 2C). For purposes of comparison, we also carried out cryoelectron tomographic analysis of two related specimens using identical imaging conditions: the pentameric immunoglobulin molecule IgM and MICA-IgP, in which the CD4 domains in D1D2-IgP have been substituted by MICA, a moiety of similar mass that does not bind gp120 but that belongs to the same structural superfamily as CD4. MICA is a ligand for the NKG2D receptors on natural killer cells (19Bauer S. Groh V. Wu J. Steinle A. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Spies T. Science. 1999; 285: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar), which is not expressed by the cell lines used to produce viruses used in this study. IgM particles, which ranged in maximum diameter from 30–33 nm, were typically less flexible, with planar, radially oriented arms frequently resolved (Fig. 1B, Fig. 2, E–G, and supplemental Movie M2), as expected based on the known structure (reviewed in Ref. 20Kolar G.R. Capra J.D. Fundamental Immunology. 2003; Google Scholar). However, MICA-IgP molecules, which have the same structural scaffold as D1D2-IgP, displayed random orientation of the arms as observed for D1D2-IgP (Fig. 1C and supplemental Movie M3).FIGURE 2D1D2-IgP and IgM are assembled differently.

D1D2-IgP and MICA-IgP typically displayed a varied, elongated morphology, whereas IgM displayed a uniformly circular morphology (supplemental Fig. S1). The AFM micrographs, which are isoforce surfaces and not true three-dimensional data, do not necessarily provide a faithful description of the native state molecular morphology, because apparent structures are potentially affected by variability in the manner of absorption to the mica and by preferential absorption of certain species. For the same reason, however, the greater morphological variability observed for D1D2-IgP implies a greater number of absorption conformations and thus greater flexibility than IgM. The apparent sizes of these particles imaged by AFM, unlike the morphologies, are not meaningful due to the effect of tip sample convolution (reviewed in Ref. 21Hansma H.G. Hoh J.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23 (pp. 47–68): 115-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar).Next we obtained cryoelectron tomograms of SIV virions in the absence and presence of MICA-IgP or D1D2-IgP. We imaged virions of SIV strain mac239, selected because of the high levels of envelope glycoprotein incorporation in the membranes of these virions (22Zhu P. Liu J. Bess J. Nature. 2006; 441: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 23Sougrat R. Bartesaghi A. Lifson J.D. Bennett A.E. Bess J.W. Zabransky D.J. Subramaniam S.

Consistent with these previous electron microscopic analyses, the typical SIV virion is 120 nm in diameter and can be studded with as many as 100 envelope spikes of ∼13 nm in height, and ∼12 nm wide at the distal end (Fig. 3, A and D). Virions treated with D1D2-IgP showed additional densities attached to the envelope spikes with sizes similar to D1D2-IgP (Fig. 3, C and E, and supplemental Movie M4), with two or more domains engaging envelope spikes within or between virions (Fig. 4 and supplemental Movies M5–M8). Neither buffer-treated SIV (650 viral tomograms) nor MICA-IgP-treated SIV (321 viral tomograms) displayed any additional density bound to an envelope spike (Fig. 3B and supplemental Movie M9). We conclude that the observed additional densities in the sample treated with D1D2-IgP are likely to represent individual D1D2-IgP molecules bound to the envelope spikes of SIV. Because MICA-IgP differs from D1D2-IgP only in specificity for gp120, this binding must be mediated by specific interaction of CD4 moieties with gp120 on the surface of SIV viruses.FIGURE 3Direct visualization of SIV neutralization.

Here, we define a ruptured virion as one showing an obvious membrane breach and total or partial loss of contents. These features were often accompanied by a reversal of membrane curvature near the opening, creating a small neck-like region. To quantitate the extent of rupture induced by addition of D1D2-IgP to the virions, we carried out a series of four independent replicates (including controls for each set). Treatment of SIV with D1D2-IgP in HBS was correlated with 25.4 ± 3.7% virion rupture (n = 2,126 virions; four replicates). Treatment of another portion of the same aliquot of SIV with the same concentration of MICA-IgP in an equal volume of HBS buffer was correlated with 9.8 ± 2.6% virion rupture (n = 2,881 virions; four replicates); treatment of another portion of the same aliquot with an equal volume of HBS buffer alone was correlated with 10.6 ± 2.1% virion rupture (n = 2,253 virions; four replicates). This corresponds to X2 = 216 and p < 0.001 for D1D2-IgP versus an equal concentration of MICA-IgP in an equal volume of HBS, and X2 = 163 and p < 0.001 for D1D2-IgP versus an equal volume of HBS, both added to a separate portion of the same aliquot for each replicate. For MICA-IgP in HBS versus an equal volume of HBS alone, X2 = 0.9, p ≤ 1. There is no significant difference in virion rupture between MICA-IgP in HBS and an equal volume of HBS alone, as expected. Because for each replicate each sample was made in parallel using the same aliquot and the same buffer and concentration, hidden variables potentially influencing virion rupture acted identically on each sample, and so we conclude that CD4-mediated binding of D1D2-IgP to SIV is correlated with a significant increase in virion rupture.FIGURE 5Virion rupture by CD4-mediated D1D2-IgP binding.

https://openalex.org/W2040027552,"We have previously reported that the downregulation of MMP-2 by adenovirus-mediated delivery of MMP-2 siRNA (Ad-MMP-2) reduced spheroid invasion and angiogenesis in vitro, and, metastasis and tumor growth in vivo. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of Ad-MMP-2-mediated growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Ad-MMP-2 infection led to the induction of apoptosis as determined by TUNEL assay, Annexin-V staining and PARP-1 cleavage in a dose-dependent manner in A549 cells. Ad-MMP-2 decreased the content of the antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and increased the content of the pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (Bax and Bcl-xS) as determined by immunoblotting analysis. Furthermore, Ad-MMP-2-mediated apoptosis was accompanied by increase in truncated Bid, release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3. Immunoblot analysis showed that Ad-MMP-2 infection caused upregulation of Fas/Fas-L and FADD, and Anti-Fas-L antibody reversed Ad-MMP-2-induced apoptosis. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-3, an endogenous inhibitor of MMP-2, which cleaves Fas-L and activates the Fas/Fas-L inducing apoptotic pathway, was increased in Ad-MMP-2-treated cells. Adenovirus-mediated expression of MMP-2 siRNA in human lung xenografts in vivo resulted in increased immunostaining of Fas, Fas-L, cleaved Bid and TIMP-3. This is the first report, to our knowledge, showing that MMP-2 inhibition upregulates TIMP-3 levels, which in turn, promotes apoptosis in lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2091986411,"Regulators of the mitotic spindle apparatus are attractive cellular targets for antitumor therapy. The centrosomal protein transforming acidic coiled coil (TACC) 3 is required for spindle assembly and proper chromosome segregation. In this study, we employed an inducible RNA interference approach to downregulate TACC3 expression. We show that TACC3 knock-down in NIH3T3 fibroblasts caused aneuploidy, but failed to overtly impair mitotic progression. TACC3 depletion rather triggered a postmitotic p53–p21WAF pathway and led to a reversible cell cycle arrest. Similar effects were induced by low concentrations of paclitaxel, a spindle poison used in antitumor therapy. Interestingly, however, and unlike in TACC3-proficient cells, paclitaxel was able to induce strong polyploidy and subsequent apoptosis in TACC3-depleted cells. Even though paclitaxel treatment was associated with the activation of the survival kinase Akt and an antiapoptotic expression of cytoplasmic p21WAF and cyclin D1, this inhibition of cell death was abrogated by depletion of TACC3. Thus, our data identify TACC3 as a potential target to overcome p21WAF-associated protection of transformed cells against paclitaxel-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2142527866,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a major focus in functional genomics programs and drug development research, but their important potential as drug targets contrasts with the still limited data available concerning their activation mechanism. Here, we investigated the activation mechanism of the cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK2R). The three-dimensional structure of inactive CCK2R was homology-modeled on the basis of crystal coordinates of inactive rhodopsin. Starting from the inactive CCK2R modeled structure, active CCK2R (namely cholecystokinin-occupied CCK2R) was modeled by means of steered molecular dynamics in a lipid bilayer and by using available data from other GPCRs, including rhodopsin. By comparing the modeled structures of the inactive and active CCK2R, we identified changes in the relative position of helices and networks of interacting residues, which were expected to stabilize either the active or inactive states of CCK2R. Using targeted molecular dynamics simulations capable of converting CCK2R from the inactive to the active state, we delineated structural changes at the atomic level. The activation mechanism involved significant movements of helices VI and V, a slight movement of helices IV and VII, and changes in the position of critical residues within or near the binding site. The mutation of key amino acids yielded inactive or constitutively active CCK2R mutants, supporting this proposed mechanism. Such progress in the refinement of the CCK2R binding site structure and in knowledge of CCK2R activation mechanisms will enable target-based optimization of nonpeptide ligands.

Because they are involved in all physiological processes, GPCRs are targeted by 50% of marketed drugs. However, these drugs address only a small fraction of the GPCR repertoire. GPCRs represent a major focus in functional genomics programs and drug development research, but their important potential as drug targets contrasts strongly with the very limited data available regarding their activation mechanism. The activation of GPCRs is generally explained by the extended ternary complex model whereby the population of receptors exists as an equilibrium between inactive and active states (1Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). According to this model, the active conformation of the receptor may be stabilized or induced by agonists. The extended ternary complex model for GPCRs is based on and sustained by the discovery of engineered constitutively active mutants, namely mutants that produce ligand-independent signaling (1Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar).

The cholecystokinin (CCK)-2 receptor (CCK2R), previously named the CCKB/gastrin receptor, belongs to family I of GPCRs, which includes rhodopsin (4Dufresne M. Seva C. Fourmy D. Physiol.

CCK2R is expressed in the central nervous system and in the gut, where it represents the predominant CCK receptor subtype. CCK2R mediates a wide spectrum of CCK- and gastrin-induced biological effects, including anxiety, pain perception, gastric acid secretion, growth, and differentiation of the gastric mucosa (4Dufresne M.

Converging studies have documented that activation of wild-type CCK2R and/or expression of a constitutively active variant may contribute to human diseases (8Ding W.Q. Kuntz S.M. Miller L.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 947-952PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hellmich M.R. Rui X.L. Hellmich H.L. Fleming R.Y. Evers B.M. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Biol.

These new findings have generated considerable interest in the identification of antagonists of CCK2R. To date, a large panel of chemically distinct CCK2R antagonists have been discovered and used to assess the functions mediated by CCK2R in animals and humans (10Herranz R. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 559-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several of these compounds have reached clinical evaluation stages for indications such as anxiety and panic disorders, sleep disorders, drug dependence, pain, gastroesophagus reflux, and gastric secretion disorders (10Herranz R. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 559-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, some reference molecules believed to be pure antagonists turned out to be endowed with some agonist activity in the stomach and pancreas as well as cells expressing CCK1R or CCK2R (11Blevins G.T. van de Westerlo Jr., E.M. Yule D.I. Williams J.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 269: 911-916PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schmassmann A. Garner A. Flogerzi B. Hasan M.Y. Sanner M. Varga L. Halter F.

On the other hand, reports on the expression of constitutively active receptors in digestive cancers and on potential therapeutic relevance for neuroendocrine tumors highlighted the need to identify inverse agonists able to reverse basal constitutive activity of CCK2R (14Reubi J.C. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 389-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Target structure-based design of new ligands requires identification of the receptor binding site and determination of the activation mechanism. Toward this aim, our group has progressively delineated the binding site of CCK2R using site-directed mutagenesis combined with molecular modeling approaches (15Gales C. Poirot M. Taillefer J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23191-23197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We identified several aromatic residues belonging to a network presumably critical for CCK2R activation (18Foucaud M. Tikhonova I.G. Langer I. Escrieut C. Dufresne M. Seva C. Maigret B. Fourmy D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this last study, differential motion of amino acid side chains within the binding pocket was observed upon in silico binding of different nonpeptide ligands that present distinct pharmacological features. Nevertheless, due to the intrinsic limitations of the modeling procedure used, no global change in CCK2R conformation was observed (18Foucaud M. Tikhonova I.G. Langer I. Escrieut C. Dufresne M. Seva C. Maigret B. Fourmy D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to increase our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms whereby CCK2R is activated. For this purpose, three-dimensional models of inactive and active CCK2R were constructed on the basis of available structural data. These modeled structures were studied using unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) in an explicit water-lipid environment. By comparing averaged modeled structures, we identified changes in the relative positions of helices and networks of interacting residues expected to stabilize either active or inactive states of CCK2R. The activation mechanism of the receptor was further investigated using targeted molecular dynamics simulations and site-directed mutagenesis. Modeling of the “Inactive” CCK2R Structure (CCK2R°)—The structure of bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1U19) crystallized in the dark was used as structural template for the homology modeling of the CCK2R receptor (19Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar). Alignment of human CCK2R sequence and bovine rhodopsin sequences was carried out using the ClustalW multiple alignment program (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55389) Google Scholar). Loops connecting transmembrane helices were modeled using the ab initio modeling program MODLOOP (21Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). The third intracellular loop was not included in the modeled structure. The crude homology model was refined using AMBER8 (available on the World Wide Web) by means of 1000 steps of steepest descent energy minimization followed by 2000 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization while all Cα carbons were harmonically restrained to their initial positions. This procedure allowed readjustment of covalent bonds and van der Waals contacts without changing the overall conformation of the protein. The model was then refined by molecular dynamics simulations in an explicit lipid bilayer. It was neutralized by the addition of 17 chloride ions and placed in a rectangular box (∼78 × 80 × 78 Å in size) containing a lipid bilayer (153 molecules of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine and 8708 molecules of water in addition to the receptor structure), resulting in a final density of 1.0 g/cm. MD simulations at 300 K and constant pressure (1 atm) with anisotropic scaling were then run for 1ns using the SANDER module in AMBER 8. The cut-off distance for the nonbonded interactions was 9 Å, and periodic boundary conditions were applied. Electrostatic interactions were represented using the smooth particle mesh Ewald method with a grid spacing of ∼1 Å. The coupling constants for the temperature and pressure baths were 1.0 and 0.2 ps, respectively. SHAKE was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen, and an integration step of 2 fs was used throughout. The nonbonded pair list was updated every 10 steps. The simulation protocol involved a series of progressive energy minimizations followed by a 20-ps heating phase and a 250-ps equilibration period, during which secondary structure restraints were applied to the transmembrane helices. These restraints were removed during the following 750 ps of data collection. System coordinates were saved every 2 ps for analysis. Modeling of the “Active” CCK2R Structure (CCK2R*)—The CCK2R° homology model obtained from the rhodopsin crystal was not directly suitable for docking purposes, because the ligand-binding pocket of inactive rhodopsin is remarkably narrow (19Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar). We therefore refined the rhodopsin-based CCK2R° model in order to obtain a model of active CCK2R. Since it has been proposed that the conserved tryptophan belonging to the CWPFF motif in helix VI changes its orientation with respect to the membrane plane during activation, being perpendicular in the inactive form and parallel in the active form, the side chain of Trp-6.48 was manually rotated to adopt the latter conformation (22Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11149-11159Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 23Crocker E. Eilers M. Ahuja S. Hornak V. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We then docked CCK4 into this crude model, taking into account all amino acids and key interactions identified in the course of binding site studies (15Gales C. Poirot M. Taillefer J. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Escrieut C. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. Silvente-Poirot S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Blaker M. Ren Y. Seshadri L. McBride E.W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5019-5023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and ran steered molecular dynamics simulations. In fact, steered molecular dynamics were first performed in the presence of CCK4, because contacts were only available for the last four residues of CCK, which correspond to the ligand binding region. Then the N-terminal extension of CCK was added. The simulation was performed in vacuo with a small spherical shell of 450 TIP3P water molecules centered around His-207. The radius of this water shell was 20 Å, ensuring the solvation of the extracellular portion of the helices and the extracellular loops. These water molecules were first energy-minimized, and then waters and protein residues were allowed to relax. In each case, 1000 steps of steepest descent were followed by 2000 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization. The final coordinate sets were used as input for the subsequent steered MD simulations. SHAKE was used for all bonds, and the integration time step was 2 fs. The cut-off was 12 Å, and a distance-dependent dielectric function was used. The list of nonbonded pairs was updated every 25 steps, and coordinates were saved every 2 ps for further analysis. The second run of 500-ps steered molecular dynamics simulations consisted of applying distance constraints by means of a harmonic potential as indicated in Table 1. The Cα carbons of helices I-III were restrained by positional constraints of 1 kcal/mol × Å during all of the simulation.TABLE 1Distances between amino acids used for generation of the CCK2R* modelDistancesCCK2R*·CCK complexaMean distances ± S.D. obtained from the production part of the MD in an explicit membrane.ReferenceÅForced during the steered molecular dynamics simulationTyr-4.60 OH CCK-Phe O (2.8-3.2 Å)bApplied during the first 500 ps of the simulations.

Open table in a new tab Once the desired distances were attained, CCK4 was substituted by CCK in the binding site. The final model was then refined by 1 ns of unrestrained MDs in an explicit lipid bilayer using the protocol described above for the CCK2R°. Finally, CCK was removed from the complex, and the free active conformation of CCK2R (CCK2R*) was also simulated by 1 ns of MD in a lipid environment. Although CCK2R* is energetically less stable than CCK2R°, the CCK2R* model did not relax back to CCK2R° during MD, because this back conversion would require a microsecond time scale and could not be observed with MD simulations in the nanoseconds time scale. The targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) approach used the standard implementation recently incorporated into AMBER (version 8.0) (available on the World Wide Web), which allows solvent molecules to move freely and follow the dynamics of the protein. A restraint was defined in terms of a mass-weighted r.m.s. superposition to the final reference structure (target, CCK2R*) and applied in the force field as an extra harmonic potential energy term of the following form, E=0.5kr×N(r·m·s·d−t·r·m·s·d)2(Eq. 1) where E is the biasing potential energy in kcal/mol during the TMD simulation, kr is the force constant, N is the number of atoms, r.m.s.d. is the root mean square deviation from the target structure, and t.r.m.s.d. is the desired root mean square deviation value. The initial value of the desired root mean square deviation was set as the root mean square deviation between the initial and target structures (CCK2R° and CCK2R*, respectively), and during the simulation, the desired root mean square deviation value was gradually decreased to 0. Only the heavy atoms of the protein were considered in the r.m.s. definition. A force constant of 0.50 kcal/mol × Å over 0.5 ns appeared sufficient to find a low energy path leading from the simulated structure to the target structure. All mutant receptor cDNAs were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) using human CCK2R cDNAs cloned in the pRFNeo vector as template. The presence of desired and the absence of undesired mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing of the complete CCK2R coding sequence (Applied Biosystems). COS-7 cells (1.5 × 106) were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, cells were transfected with 1 μg/plate of pRFNeo vectors containing the cDNA for the wild-type or mutated CCK2 receptors, using a modified DEAE-dextran method. Cells were transferred to 24-well plates 24 h after transfection at a density of 150,000 cells/well for inositol phosphate determination and 5000-10,000 cells/well for binding assays. Approximately 24 h after transfer to 24-well plates and following overnight incubation in DMEM containing 2 μCi/ml myo-2-[3H]inositol (specific activity 10-25 Ci/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), transfected cells were washed with DMEM and incubated for 30 min in 1 ml/well DMEM containing 20 mm LiCl at 37 °C. Cells were washed with Ins-P buffer at pH 7.45: phosphate-buffered saline containing 135 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm LiCl, 11.1 mm glucose, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.3-ml Ins-P buffer alone or with CCK in the presence of increasing concentrations of synthetic ligands. Reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of methanol/HCl to each well, and contents were transferred to a column (Dowex AG 1-X8, formate form; Bio-Rad) for the determination of Ins-P. Columns were washed twice with 3 ml of distilled water and twice with 2 ml of 5 mm sodium tetraborate, 60 mm sodium formate. The content of each column was eluted by the addition of 2 ml of 1 m ammonium formate, 100 mm formic acid. Radioactivity of 1 ml of the eluted fraction was evaluated using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Values for Ins-P accumulation were normalized to a constant number of expressed receptors (1 pmol) and were expressed as -fold number of the basal value achieved with the wild-type CCK2R. Mock cells were transfected with a pRFNeo noncoding vector. Approximately 24 h after transfer of transfected cells to 24-well plates, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.3 ml DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin with an appropriate concentration of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified 125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)-CCK9 (specific activity 1600-2000 Ci/mmol) in the presence or absence of unlabeled CCK. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 2% bovine serum albumin, and cell-associated radioligand was collected by cell lysis with 0.1 n NaOH. The radioactivity was directly counted in a γ counter (Auto-Gamma; Packard Instrument Co.). Receptor density (Bmax) and Kd were calculated from homologous 125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)-CCK9 competition binding experiments using Ligand software (Kell, Cambridge, UK). Ki values were calculated using the nonlinear curve fitting software GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). Modeled Structure of Active CCK2R (CCK2R*)—Because CCK2R is a member of the family I of rhodopsin-like GPCRs, the three-dimensional model of the inactive state of the CCK2R (CCK2R°) was constructed by homology modeling using coordinates from the inactive rhodopsin crystal isolated in the dark (19Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar). To obtain CCK2R*, the agonist·CCK2R complex was modeled (Fig. 1). The procedure of modeling, which is described in detail under “Experimental Procedures,” included the following main steps: rotation of conserved Trp-6.48 side chain (22Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11149-11159Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar); docking of CCK4 followed by steered molecular dynamics simulation in vacuum; steered molecular dynamics simulation based on constrained distances indicated in Table 1 and derived from published data on GPCR activation; and refinement in a lipid bilayer (see Table 1 for references). As illustrated in Fig. 2, after the equilibration period, progression of the r.m.s. deviations of the coordinates of the Cα atoms relative to the average structure showed a notably stable behavior, reflecting that the overall architecture of the protein was preserved for the whole length of the simulation for both CCK2R° and the CCK2R*·CCK complex. Furthermore, inter-Cα distances used during steered molecular dynamics were maintained in the absence of external restraints (Table 1). As a consequence of CCK docking and molecular dynamics applied to the complex, the binding pocket of the initial rhodopsin-based model (CCK2R°) was enlarged to snugly accommodate CCK in a position that was in agreement with site-directed mutagenesis data (see Table 3) (see Table 1 for references). Indeed, the CCK binding pocket was mainly formed by residues from transmembrane helices (Figs. 1 and 3). Sulfated CCK-Tyr was well engaged by two hydrogen bonds with Arg-1.35 and Tyr-1.39 and by stacking interactions with His-7.39. The CCK-tryptophan was located in the hydrophobic/aromatic pocket formed by residues from helices III, VII, and the first extracellular loop. The indole moiety of this residue established aromatic contacts with Tyr-7.43 and hydrophobic contacts with Phe-120 in the first extracellular loop and His-7.39. The CCK-methionine residue was placed between helix VI and helix VII interacting with Val-6.51 and the Cα carbon of Ser-7.45. The phenylalanine ring was located in a hydrophobic/aromatic pocket composed of residues from different helices: Val-3.36, Met-4.57 and Tyr-4.60, Leu-5.46, and Val-6.51 and Tyr-6.52. The aspartic acid residue accepted hydrogen bonds from His-207 in the second extracellular loop and the guanidinium group of Arg-6.58. The carbonyl group of CCK amide accepted a hydrogen bond from Tyr-4.60 hydroxyl oxygen, and CCK nitrogen amide donated a hydrogen to Asn-6.55 carbonyl amide. The fact that all of these intermolecular interactions were maintained after the equilibration period confirmed the stability of the modeled complex (Table 1). After the removal of CCK, the unbound CCK2R* was inserted into an explicit lipid bilayer and subjected to molecular dynamics simulations, resulting in a stable trajectory (Fig. 2) and yielding the refined CCK2R* model.TABLE 3Pharmacological properties of CCK2R mutantsCCK2RCCK bindingCCK-induced inositol phosphate productionHigh affinityLow affinityBmaxEC50FmutEmaxKd1Fmut1Kd2Fmut2High affinityLow affinitynmnmpmol/106 cellsnmWild type0.37 ± 0.0212.8 ± 0.310.89 ± 0.052.3 ± 0.20.34 ± 0.051100R1.35A1.30 ± 0.30422.0 ± 3.080.19 ± 0.040.66 ± 0.052.2 ± 0.46100Y1.39A0.12 ± 0.030.36.0 ± 2.61.70.41 ± 0.122.5 ± 1.10.34 ± 0.02196F120A1.20 ± 0.20317.0 ± 4.060.14 ± 0.030.65 ± 0.051.6 ± 0.2599M3.32A0.23 ± 0.090.642.8 ± 20.912.01.40 ± 0.804.5 ± 1.3O.43 ± 0.111119V3.36A0.10 ± 0.030.36.6 ± 2.31.80.46 ± 0.072.2 ± 0.60.53 ± 0.141.390M4.57A0.46 ± 0.051.373.9 ± 59.920.80.19 ± 0.051.19 ± 0.470.90 ± 0.182.2121Y4.60F3.20 ± 0.50921.0 ± 4.080.28 ± 0.050.82 ± 0.183.7 ± 0.41197Y4.60A50.0 ± 5.0136436 ± 241560.45 ± 0.052.2 ± 0.537.0 ± 6.0109215H207A8.30 ± 1.402751.0 ± 5.0180.31 ± 0.050.78 ± 0.1312.0 ± 2.03590L5.42A0.20 ± 0.020.64.0 ± 0.81.10.54 ± 0.043.3 ± 0.20.48 ± 0.071.2190L5.43A0.30 ± 0.040.832.1 ± 17.59.02.40 ± 0.603.8 ± 2.00.39 ± 0.070.9120F5.47A0.31 ± 0.050.91.54 ± 0.280.27 ± 0.060.7150F6.44A0.22 ± 0.050.614.2 ± 7.24.00.58 ± 0.130.77 ± 0.300.38 ± 0.070.996W6.48A0.31 ± 0.050.919.5 ±"
https://openalex.org/W1972818734,"Post-irradiation complications including thrombus formation result from increased procoagulant activity of vascular endothelial cells and elevated levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) contribute to this process. We have previously demonstrated that irradiation induction of the VWF is mediated through interaction of NF-Y transcription factor with its cognate binding site in the VWF promoter. We have also demonstrated that irradiation increases the association of NF-Y with histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). We now report that irradiation decreases the association of NF-Y with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). We demonstrate that irradiation-induced changes in association of NF-Y with HDAC1 and PCAF lead to increased PCAF recruitment to the VWF promoter, increased association of acetylated histone H4 with the VWF promoter and subsequently increased transcription. We also demonstrate that this process is correlated to dephosphorylation of HDAC1 and is inhibited by calyculin A, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase1."

Here, we characterize the activation of a RETMEN 2B variant carrying the point mutation Met918Thr, and show that the 150 kDa precursor of RETMEN 2B becomes phosphorylated already during synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). At least three different tyrosine residues (Tyr905, Tyr1062, Tyr1096) of the RETMEN 2B precursor are phosphorylated before the oncogenic receptor reaches the cell surface. We also demonstrate that the precursor of RETMEN 2B interacts with both growth factor receptor-bound protein and Src homology 2 domain-containing already in the ER, and that this interaction is dependent on the kinase activity of RET. With the aid of two RET mutants (RETMEN 2B/S32L and RETMEN 2B/F393L), which accumulate in the ER, we show that the oncogenic precursor of the receptor has the capacity to activate AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 from the ER. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the oncogenic precursor of RETMEN 2B is phosphorylated, interacts with adapter proteins and induces downstream signalling from the ER."

https://openalex.org/W1973453862,"Antiandrogens are initially effective in controlling prostate cancer (CaP), the second most common cancer in men, but resistance, associated with the loss of androgen-regulated cell cycle control, is a major problem. At present there is no effective treatment for androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC). Cellular proliferation is driven by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) with kinase inhibitors (for example, p27) applying the breaks. We present the first investigation of the therapeutic potential of CDK inhibitors, using the guanine-based CDK inhibitor NU2058 (CDK2 IC(50)=17 microM, CDK1 IC(50)=26 microM), in comparison with the antiandrogen bicalutamide (Casodex) in AIPC cells. A panel of AIPC cells was found to be resistant to Casodex-induced growth inhibition, but with the exception of PC3 (GI(50)=38 microM) and CWR22Rv1 (GI(50)=46 microM) showed similar sensitivity to NU2058 (GI(50)=10-17 microM) compared to androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells (GI(50)=15 microM). In LNCaP cells and their Casodex-resistant derivative, LNCaP-cdxR, growth inhibition by NU2058 was accompanied by a concentration-dependent increase in p27 levels, reduced CDK2 activity and pRb phosphorylation, a decrease in early gene expression and G1 cell cycle phase arrest in both cell lines. In response to Casodex, there were similar observations in LNCaP cells (GI(50)=6+/-3 microM Casodex) but not in LNCaP-cdxR cells (GI(50)=24+/-5 microM Casodex)."
https://openalex.org/W2077109576,"Nucleotide sugar transporters have long been assumed to be antiporters that exclusively use nucleoside monophosphates as antiport substrates. Here we present evidence indicating that two other types of nucleotide sugar transporters exist that differ in their antiport substrate specificity. Biochemical studies using microsomes derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing either human (h) UGTrel7 or the Drosophila (d) FRC (Fringe connection) transporter revealed that (i) efflux of preloaded UDP-glucuronic acid from the yeast microsomes expressing hUGTrel7 was strongly enhanced by UDP-GlcNAc added in the external medium, but not by UMP or UDP, suggesting that hUGTrel7 may be described as a UDP-sugar/UDP-sugar antiporter, and (ii) addition of UDP-sugars, UDP, or UMP in the external medium stimulated the efflux of preloaded UDP-GlcNAc from the yeast microsomes expressing dFRC to a comparable extent, suggesting that UDP, as well as UMP, may serve as an antiport substrate of dFRC. Antiport of UDP-sugars with these specific substrates was reproduced and definitively confirmed using proteoliposomes reconstituted from solubilized and purified transporters. Possible physiological implications of these observations are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2016597865,"A key step in activation of the p53 tumor suppressor is its transport into the nucleus; however, despite intensive study of p53, the regulation of its subcellular localization is still poorly understood. Here we examined the p53 nuclear importation using a series of mutant cell lines that were resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of temperature-sensitive murine p53 (tsp53). Examination of the p53 subcellular localization in these cell lines showed that the protein was cytoplasmic in most of them. Using a digitonin-permeabilized cell in vitro nuclear import system, we show that cytosols from these cell lines do not support nuclear translocation of a p53 nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing substrate protein, but promote nuclear localization of a SV40TAgNLS-containing substrate. Complementation assays and use of the mutant cells themselves in the in vitro assays demonstrate that both soluble and insoluble protein components are involved in p53 nuclear import. Collectively, our results suggest that there is a p53 NLS-selective nuclear import pathway and that both soluble and insoluble proteins are involved in its function."
https://openalex.org/W2043142184,"Estradiol (E2) acts through the estrogen receptor (ER) to downregulate many genes, and tamoxifen (Tam) largely reverses this repression but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Repression of the folate receptor (FR)-alpha P4 core promoter by ER is enhanced by E2 and reversed by Tam. This effect was unaffected by inhibition of new protein synthesis and required the E/F and the DNA-binding domains of ER without direct binding of ER to DNA. The repression by E2/ER was not specific for either Sp1 or TATA elements but was loosely selective for the initiator and flanking sequence. Insertion of a response element or a relatively strong Sp1 cluster to recruit ER upstream of the core promoters caused a switch to activation by E2/ER that was inhibited by Tam. In nuclear extracts, association of ER with a biotinylated core promoter fragment was promoted by E2 but Tam blocked this effect. Repression/de-repression of the P4 promoter and endogenous FR-alpha expression by E2/Tam required SMRT and/or NCoR. ER associated with the chromosomal P4 promoter and SMRT and NCoR associated with it in an ER-dependent manner; these associations were favored by E2 but disrupted by Tam, in the short term, without changes in ER expression. TAFII30 was required for optimal P4 promoter activity and for the repressive association of ER. E2 may thus maintain a low transcriptional status of genes by favoring direct TAFII30-dependent association of ER with the core promoter in a co-repressor complex containing SMRT and/or NCoR; this repression is overridden in target genes containing an upstream element that strongly recruits ER. In addition to suppressing the activation of classical E2 target genes, Tam may upregulate genes by passively dissociating the ER co-repressor complex."

The ligand for human CD2 (CD58) is missing in rodents.There has been confusion in the literature over the inhibitory and activating potential of CD244 (2B4) and over differences in behavior between mouse and human CD244. A study in a CD244-deficient mouse showed clearly that, when CD48 on a target cell is not able to bind to CD244 on an NK cell, killing is enhanced (12Lee K.M. McNerney M.E. Stepp S.E. Mathew P.A.

The CD244 cytoplasmic tail contains the highest number (four) of the particular tyrosine motif among the SAP-binding receptors that, when phosphorylated upon cell activation, can bind SAP and/or EAT-2 (see Fig. 1) (3Engel P.

We sought to identify the features of CD244 function that are conserved between mouse and human with the aim of establishing the fundamental mechanism by which CD244 regulates immune responses. An understanding of the differences between mouse and human CD244 will allow interpretation of the relevance of mouse model data to human. There is evidence that manipulating CD48/CD244 interactions may be useful therapeutically, as CD244-deficient mice are more effective in tumor clearance (12Lee K.M. McNerney M.E. Stepp S.E.

We show that, in both mice and humans, engagement of mouse and human CD244 on normal NK cells by CD48 on target cells can be inhibitory. By determining the hierarchy of interactions likely to compete for direct binding to CD244 at physiological temperature, we show that intracellular interactions of CD244 are generally conserved between mouse and human CD244. We identify FYN kinase as a potential binding partner for the tail of EAT-2 and provide functional data to show that EAT-2 is not inhibitory per se. This suggests a model in which the functional outcome of CD48/CD244 engagement is a reflection of the potential to recruit FYN kinase and the balance between co-engaged inhibitory and activating receptors. The general mechanism is applicable to the other SAP-binding receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant Proteins—The rat basophil leukemia cell line was stably transfected with the pBabe vector encoding a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular region of the C57/BL6 allele of mouse CD244 (11Brown M.H.

Proteins were subjected to gel filtration on Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) prior to Biacore analysis. Concentration was determined using absorbance at 280 nm and the following theoretical extinction coefficients (Vector NTI): mouse SAP and SH2, 23,140 and 23,020 m–1 cm–1; human SAP and SH2, 24,660 and 24,540 M–1 cm–1; mouse EAT-2, 19,090 m–1 cm–1; human EAT-2 and SH2, 21,980 and 15,130 m–1 cm–1; human FYN SH2, 26,510 M–1 cm–1; human –1 FYN SH3, 29,280 m–1 cm–1; mouse FYN SH3-SH2, 35,680 m cm–1; and human FYN SH3-SH2, 37,561 m–1 cm–1 For mammalian expression as enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fusion proteins, BamHI-HindIII fragments from pTrcHISA constructs were cloned into the retroviral vector pLEGFP-C1 (Invitrogen) and expressed in 2B4 hybridoma cells as described for the pBabe vector, and selection was maintained with G418 (0.4 mg/ml).Biacore™ Analyses—Biacore analyses using a Biacore™ 2000 were carried out essentially as described previously (11Brown M.H. Boles K. van der Merwe P.A. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Barclay A.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Analyses of CD244 mAb blocking were carried out at 25 °C (11Brown M.H. Boles K. van der Merwe P.A. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Barclay A.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and all other experiments were carried out at 37 °C. Streptavidin (∼3000 response units (RU)) and mAbs (∼15,000 RU) were directly coupled to CM5 chips by amine coupling for immobilization of biotinylated phosphorylated peptides (Peptide Protein Research Ltd. (Fareham, UK) and Sigma) (see Tables 1 and 2) and native receptors, respectively. The FYN SH3 domain (∼1250–2000 RU) was immobilized by amine coupling. In measurements of binding to the four ITSM peptides, one flow cell was used as a negative control and then coated with the fourth peptide, and equilibrium binding was repeated. At the level of immobilization of peptide (∼25 RU), there was no difference between negative controls of streptavidin or an irrelevant phosphorylated peptide. Native receptor was captured from cell lysate (108 cell eq/ml) by passing the lysate at 1 μl/min over a mAb-coated flow cell. Cell lysates were prepared from lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells that had been treated with pervanadate or not at 108 cells/ml for 7–10 min at 37 °C; washed with phosphate-buffered saline; and lysed at 108 cells/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, 1% Brij 96, 1 mm sodium pervanadate, mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm NaF for ∼10 min at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,800 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were used immediately in Biacore experiments.TABLE 1SAP, EAT-2, and FYN bind phosphorylated CD244 peptides with affinities consistent with a direct functional interactionImmobilized peptideMouse SAP SH2Mouse SAPMouse EAT-2Human SAP SH2Human SAPHuman EAT-2 SH2Human EAT-2Mouse FYN SH3-SH2Human FYN SH2CD244 ITSM10.20.230.70.160.750.10.430.850.55 m: EPLTIYEYVKD (93%) h: EFLTIYEDVKD (81%)CD244 ITSM214.65.50.080.30.250.61.623.6 m: DRGTMYSMIQC (70%) h: GGSTIYSMIQS (77%)CD244 ITSM30.51.40.90.08170.171.41.52 m: EKCTVYSVVQP (41%) h: PAYTLYSLIQP (100%)CD244 ITSM411.521.751.20.540.651.111.7 m: LSCTVYEEVGN (>70%) h: FNSTIYEVIGK (100%) Open table in a new tab TABLE 2The FYN SH2 domain binds phosphorylated EAT-2 tail peptides with higher affinity than SAP binds the FYN SH3 domainImmobilized peptide/proteinmFYN SH3-SH2hFYN SH3-SH2hFYN SH2hSAP SH2hSAPEAT-2 Tyr/Phe1190.5>100 m: LELNVYENTDE (84%) h: LELETFVNSNS (87%)EAT-2 Tyr128113 m: NTDEEYVDVLP (97%) h: NSNSDYVDVLP (94%)FYN SH311, 9aIn the same experiment, the human SAP SH2 domain bound the phosphorylated peptide of the membrane-proximal motif of human CD244 (KD = 0.14 μm at 37 °C)., 6bThe human SAP SH2 domain and full-length SAP were compared in the same experiment.30bThe human SAP SH2 domain and full-length SAP were compared in the same experiment.a In the same experiment, the human SAP SH2 domain bound the phosphorylated peptide of the membrane-proximal motif of human CD244 (KD = 0.14 μm at 37 °C).b The human SAP SH2 domain and full-length SAP were compared in the same experiment. Open table in a new tab Antibodies—AO rats (haplotype RT1u; Harlan UK) were initially immunized intravenously with 4 × 106 irradiated rat basophil leukemia cells (haplotype RT1u) expressing the CD244-ζ chimera, as it was more highly expressed than native CD244. The rats were given three additional immunizations, once with complete and twice with incomplete Freund's adjuvant of 20 μg of CD244-CD4d3+4 soluble fusion protein purified from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with a CD244-CD4d3+4-PEE14 construct (11Brown M.H.

Rats were boosted three times intravenously with 4 × 106 rat basophil leukemia cells expressing CD244-ζ and 20 μgof CD244-CD4d3+4 soluble fusion protein. 3 days after the final boost, the spleen was removed, and a single cell suspension was prepared and fused with the Lewis rat myeloma cell line Y3 AG8.153. Three hybridomas producing mAb that stained CD244/171 cell lines but not the 171 untransfected cell line were isolated and subcloned twice by limiting dilution. The mAbs were of the IgG1-κ (OX120) and IgG2a-κ (OX121 and OX122) isotypes as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Pharmingen). mAbs OX121 and OX122 were purified on protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Fab fragments were prepared by papain digestion and gel filtration on a Sephadex HR 200 column (GE Healthcare) in phosphate-buffered saline. C57/BL6 and BALB/c mice obtained from Sir William Dunn School of Pathology were used for flow cytometric analysis of normal CD244.Other mAbs used were as follows: anti-mouse 2B4 (Pharmingen), anti-mouse CD3 (KT3) rat IgG2a, anti-mouse CD2 (RM2.1) rat IgG2a, anti-mouse CD48 (OX78) rat IgG2a, antirat κ-chain (OX11) rat IgG2a, anti-mouse κ-chain (OX20) rat IgG1, anti-mouse B220, anti-human CD244 (C1.7) mouse IgG1 (Beckman Coulter), anti-human CD48 (6.28) mouse IgG3, antihuman CD2 (X53) mouse IgG1, negative controls mouse IgG1 (OX21) and mouse IgG3 (OX61), anti-human CD56 (TA181 H12), anti-human CD3 (OKT3), anti-human CD4 (OKT4), anti-CD8 (OKT8), anti-phosphotyrosine (clone PT66; Sigma), phycoerythrin-coupled secondary antibodies (Sigma), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibodies (Serotec). Antibodies used in Western blotting and immunoprecipitation experiments included anti-human EAT-2 polyclonal antibody raised against an unphosphorylated (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or tyrosine-phosphorylated (Everest Biotech) peptide from the tail of human EAT-2, anti-FYN polyclonal antibody (Upstate), biotinylated anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (clone PT66; Sigma), and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary reagents (Sigma).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared at 108 cells/ml using Triton X-100 detergent as described above (29Hassan N.J. Simmonds S.J. Clarkson N.G. Puklavec M.J. Hanrahan S. Bomb M. Barclay A.N. Brown M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6727-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were prepared using Dynal beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Western blot analysis was carried out using 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and ECL detection methods (Amersham Biosciences) (29Hassan N.J. Simmonds S.J. Clarkson N.G.

LAK cells were generated by culturing the passaged cells in RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (complete RPMI medium) and containing 0.5% spent tissue culture supernatant from a rat interleukin-2 (IL-2)-producing CHO line at 37 °C and 5% CO2. On day 3, half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Murine LAK cells were used on day 6. Human NK cells were purified from non-adherent peripheral blood cells (National Blood Service, Bristol, UK) by depletion with anti-human CD3, CD4, and CD8 mAbs and cultured for ∼12 days with an irradiated Epstein-Barr virus-positive B cell line (221.721) and irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood cells. 2 × 104 RMA-S or 221.721 cells, target and effector NK cells (LAK cells), or human NK cells at the indicated effector/target ratios were incubated in complete RPMI medium in 96-well plates. mAb or Fab fragments were added to the wells at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. After 4–5 h of incubation at 37 °C, the supernatants were removed, and the amount of lysis was measured using a nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay (CytoTox 96, Promega Corp.). Antigen-specific IL-2 production of hybridoma cells (105 cells/well) using mouse CD48+ and CD48–, major histocompatibility complex Class II+ CHO cells (30Wild M.K. Cambiaggi A. Brown M.H. Davies E.A.

In all cellular experiments, triplicate samples were assayed, and the mean is displayed with S.E. Each experiment was performed at least four times.RESULTSCD244 Can Be Inhibitory in Killing by Murine NK Cells—To distinguish between the effects of CD244 and CD2 engagement by CD48 in rodents, we produced an anti-CD244 mAb that was more effective at blocking CD48/CD244 interactions than that characterized previously (11Brown M.H. Boles K. van der Merwe P.A. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Barclay A.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Of three mAbs that were specific for mouse CD244 and bound to a mouse T cell hybridoma transduced with mouse CD244 (Fig. 1b) (data not shown), one (mAb OX122) completely blocked binding of CD48-CD4d3+4-coated fluorescent beads to cells (30Wild M.K.

Using real-time PCR, we identified plasmalemmal NHE1 and intracellular NHE7 as the two most abundant NHE isoforms in mouse islets. We, therefore, compared insulin secretion, cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) and pHc in islets from normal mice and mice bearing an inactivating mutation of NHE1 (Slc9A1-swe/swe). The experiments were performed in HCO–3/CO2 or HEPES/NaOH buffers. PCR and functional approaches showed that NHE1 mutant islets do not express compensatory pH-regulating mechanisms. NHE1 played a greater role than HCO–3-dependent mechanisms in the correction of an acidification imposed by a pulse of NH4Cl. In contrast, basal pHc (in low glucose) and the alkalinization produced by high glucose were independent of NHE1. Dimethylamiloride, a classic blocker of Na+/H+ exchange, did not affect pHc but increased insulin secretion in NHE1 mutant islets, indicating unspecific effects. In control islets, glucose similarly increased [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion in HCO–3 and HEPES buffer, although pHc changed in opposite directions. The amplification of insulin secretion that glucose produces when [Ca2+]c is clamped at an elevated level by KCl was also unrelated to pHc and pHc changes. All effects of glucose on [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion proved independent of NHE1. In conclusion, NHE1 protects β-cells against strong acidification, but has no role in stimulus-secretion coupling. The changes in pHc produced by glucose involve HCO–3-dependent mechanisms. Variations in β-cell pHc are not causally related to changes in insulin secretion.

It is thus unclear whether a Na+/H+ exchanger is important for glucose-induced pHc changes in β-cells, and whether these changes play a role in the stimulation of insulin secretion, through one or both pathways. These were the questions addressed in the present study.To date, ten isoforms of Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE1 to NHE10), encoded by the Slc9 family of genes, have been identified (32Orlowski J.

Jonas J.C. Rahier J. Devuyst O. Henquin J.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 38: 409-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Here, we first compared the expression of NHE isoforms in mouse islets. Having found that NHE1 is, by far, the most abundant among the plasma membrane isoforms, we next studied Slc9A1swe/swe mutant mice bearing a spontaneous inactivating mutation of NHE1 (36Cox G.A. Lutz C.M. Yang C.L. Biemesderfer D. Bronson R.T. Fu A. Aronson P.S. Noebels J.L. Frankel W.N. Cell. 1997; 91: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) to test the role of Na+/H+ exchange in β-cell pHc regulation under basal conditions and glucose stimulation. Finally, we measured pHc, [Ca2+]c and insulin secretion in control and NHE1 mutant islets perifused with HCO–3-containing and HCO–3-free solutions to assess the possible role of pHc in glucose stimulation of insulin secretion through the triggering and amplifying pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSolutions and Reagents—A bicarbonate-buffered medium (HCO–3 medium) and a HEPES-buffered medium (HEPES medium) were used. The HCO–3 medium contained 120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and was gassed with O2/CO2 (94%:6%) to maintain pH at 7.4. The HEPES medium contained 135 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and was gassed with O2. Its pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. When the concentration of KCl was increased to 30 mm, that of NaCl was decreased accordingly. Diazoxide was a gift from Schering-Plough, Brussels. Fura PE3-AM and BCECF-AM were obtained from Molecular Probes. Cariporide was bought from Allichem, LLC, Baltimore, MD. 5-N,N-dimethylamiloride (DMA), 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS), and all others reagents were from Sigma. Stock solutions of DMA, EIPA and cariporide (50 mm) and DIDS (150 mm) were prepared in Me2SO, and aliquots were added to test solutions. The solvent alone had no effects.Animals—C57BL/6.SJL+/swe (swe: slow wave epilepsy) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MI). These heterozygous mice were mated, and genotyping of the pups was performed as previously described (36Cox G.A. Lutz C.M. Yang C.L. Biemesderfer D. Bronson R.T. Fu A. Aronson P.S. Noebels J.L. Frankel W.N. Cell. 1997; 91: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Homozygous NHE1 mutant mice (Slc9A1swe/swe, NHE1 mutant) and wild-type littermates (Slc9A1+/+, control) were studied at 7–9 weeks of age.Preparations—Islets were aseptically isolated by collagenase digestion of the pancreas of NHE1 mutant and control mice (37Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1266-1273PubMed Google Scholar). After hand selection, the islets were cultured for about 18 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 international units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.RNA Extraction and Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted, quantified, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA as previously described (38Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H. Patane G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14112-14121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) using random hexamers and 200 units of M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase RNase H– Point Mutant (Promega, Madison, WI). The sense and antisense primers were chosen in the coding region of gene mRNA sequences, and their specificity was checked by BLAST search in the GenBank™ data bank (Table 1). Real-time PCR was performed with the iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) using the fluorescent dye SYBR Green I to monitor DNA amplification. The reaction was performed in duplicate, in a 25-μl reaction volume containing cDNA (2–20 ng of total RNA equivalents), 300 nm primers (Table 1), 12.5 μl iQ superMIX (Bio-Rad), and water to volume. TATA box-binding protein (TBP) was used as a reporter gene. Under these conditions, PCR efficiencies for amplification of NHE isoforms and TBP were similar. For all NHE isoforms, real-time PCR was performed in parallel in islets and control tissues mRNA (Table 1), with positive amplification in controls. After amplification, the specificity of PCR products was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and analysis of the melting curve. The threshold cycle (Ct) was determined using iCycler iQ software 3.0. After correction of the Cts for differences in cDNA input in the PCR, the ΔCt values were calculated in every sample for each NHE isoform as follows: CtNHEx – CtTBP. The NHEx over TBP mRNA ratios can be estimated by the formula 2–ΔCt (39Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

After loading, the islets were transferred into a chamber mounted on the stage of a microscope and maintained at 37 °C. The Fura-PE3 probe was excited at 340 and 380 nm, and emission was captured at 510 nm with a CCD camera. From the ratio of fluorescence (at 340 and 380 nm), [Ca2+]c was calculated by comparison with a calibration curve. Details of the method have been reported elsewhere (40Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measurements of pHc, islets were loaded with BCECF (0.5 μm, 2 h at 37 °C) in 1 ml of HCO3− or HEPES medium. They were then examined in the same system as that used for Ca2+, but the probe was excited at 440 and 490 nm and emission was captured at 535 nm. The pHc was calculated from an in situ calibration curve constructed from the ratio values obtained by perifusing loaded islets with solutions of different pH (between 6 and 7.5) containing 10 μg/ml nigericin. The medium had the following composition: 136 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES.Measurements of Insulin Secretion and Islet or Pancreas Insulin Content—Batches of 20 cultured islets were transferred into chambers of a perifusion system (41Henquin J.C. Nenquin M. Stiernet P. Ahren B. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The effluent medium was collected at 42-s or 2-min intervals and saved for measurement of insulin by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as a standard and ethanol to precipitate bound insulin (42Heding L.G. Diabetologia. 1972; 8: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). A small volume of concentrated NaHCO3 or neutralized HEPES solution was added to all samples of experiments performed in HEPES medium or HCO–3 medium, respectively, to achieve an identical final ionic composition. The standard curve was also prepared in a medium containing both HCO–3 and HEPES. At the end of the experiments, the islets were recovered from the chambers, counted, and transferred in acid-ethanol for insulin extraction and measurement. The insulin content of the whole pancreas of NHE1 mutant and control mice was determined after extraction by homogenization and sonication of the tissue in acid ethanol.Morphological Studies—The pancreas of control and NHE1 mutant mice was fixed in formalin for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. Glucagon cells were immunostained as described elsewhere (43Sempoux C. Guiot Y. Dahan K. Moulin P. Stevens M. Lambot V. de Lonlay P. Fournet J.C. Junien C. Jaubert F. Nihoul-Fekete C. Saudubray J.M. Rahier J. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using a mouse monoclonal antibody (GLU-001, NovoBiolabs, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). Stained pancreas slides were digitized through a Zeiss microscope coupled to a DAGE-MTI CCD camera (Michigan City, IN). Fields containing islets (5–11 per slide) were captured through a ×10 objective (0.727 × 0.758 μm/pixel). Images were analyzed with a Zeiss KS400 imaging system. Islets were delineated by the user, and glucagon cells were identified by their gray level.Presentation of Results—Results are presented as means ± S.E. for the indicated number of animals or experiments. The statistical significance of differences between control and NHE1 mutant mice was evaluated by unpaired Student's t test. The effect of various drugs on insulin secretion was assessed by analysis of variance followed by a Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons with controls.RESULTSIdentification of NHE Isoforms Expressed in Mouse Islets—We used real-time PCR to compare the expression of the 10 known isoforms of NHE in control mouse islets (Fig. 1). The amount of mRNA for each isoform was reported to that of TBP. Among the isoforms present in the plasma membrane (NHE1 to NHE5 and NHE10) (32Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Pflugers Archiv.-Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 34Wang D. King S.M. Quill T.A. Doolittle L.K. Garbers D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), NHE1 was the most largely expressed. Although primers and conditions of PCR amplification used for the 10 isoforms were different, a cautious comparison indicates that NHE1 expression is about 50-fold higher than NHE5, 450-fold higher than NHE2 and 1800-fold higher than NHE4. No NHE3 was detected even after an amplification of 50 cycles. Of the organellar isoforms of NHE (NHE6 to NHE9) (32Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Pflugers Archiv.-Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 33Nakamura N. Tanaka S. Teko Y. Mitsui K. Kanazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1561-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), NHE7 was strongly expressed, ∼50-fold more than the other three.Because NHE1 was, by far, the most abundant plasma membrane isoform in normal islets, mice with an inactivating mutation of NHE1 (36Cox G.A. Lutz C.M. Yang C.L. Biemesderfer D. Bronson R.T. Fu A. Aronson P.S. Noebels J.L. Frankel W.N. Cell. 1997; 91: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) could be a useful model to study the role of the Na+/H+ exchanger in insulin secretion. As expected, no NHE1 was detected in NHE1 mutant mouse islets, which expressed the other isoforms as in controls, with only two exceptions. The plasma membrane isoforms NHE2 and 4 were more expressed in NHE1 mutant than control islets, but this expression remained very low compared with that of NHE1 in control islets, and lower than that of NHE5 in both types of islets (Fig. 1).Characteristics of Control and NHE1 Mutant Mice—As previously reported, NHE1 mutant mice (Slc9A1swe/swe) exhibited ataxia in the hind limbs and seizures, and grew more slowly than controls (36Cox G.A. Lutz C.M. Yang C.L. Biemesderfer D. Bronson R.T. Fu A. Aronson P.S. Noebels J.L. Frankel W.N. Cell. 1997; 91: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although many died of their neurological problems a few weeks after weaning, we found it possible to prolong the lifespan of the mice by providing food and water close to the floor of the cages. The in vitro experiments using isolated islets were performed with control and NHE1 mutant mice of a mean age of 54 days (range 45–63). Table 2 compares NHE1 mutant and age-matched control mice. The body weight of NHE1 mutant mice was ∼30% smaller. Their blood glucose was not different, but their plasma insulin was lower. The insulin content of the pancreas was lower, but not different from controls when expressed relative to the mass of pancreas or to body weight, indicating that there is no specific impact of the lack of NHE1 on β-cell development. Microscopic examination of the pancreas of NHE1 mutant mice showed that the morphological organization of the islets was normal, with a regular to oval shape and peripheral localization of glucagon cells. However, the average diameter of the islets was smaller (142 ± 7 μm, n = 63) than in control mice (193 ± 8 μm, n = 76, p < 0.007), which may explain the 33% lower insulin content of the NHE1 mutant islets that we used for in vitro experiments (Table 2).TABLE 2Characteristics of control and NHE1 mutant miceControlsNHE1 mutantAge (days)54 ± 0.6 (62)aValues are means ± S.E. for (n) animals or measurements.54 ± 0.6 (63)Body weight (g)19.1 ± 0.4 (62)13.7 ± 0.3 (63)bp < 0.001 by Student's t test.Blood glucose (mm)8.9 ± 0.2 (62)8.5 ± 0.2 (63)Plasma insulin (ng/ml)1.3 ± 0.1 (45)0.7 ± 0.1 (47)bp < 0.001 by Student's t test.Pancreas weight (mg)182 ± 5 (7)120 ± 4 (8)bp < 0.001 by Student's t test.Pancreatic insulin (μg)92.0 ± 7.0 (7)55.1 ± 2.8 (8)bp < 0.001 by Student's t test.Pancreatic insulin (μg/mg)0.48 ± 0.03 (7)0.47 ± 0.03 (8)Pancreatic insulin (μg/g b.w.)4.5 ± 0.3 (7)4.0 ± 0.2 (8)Islet insulin (ng/islet)83 ± 3.5 (42)56 ± 2.4 (40)bp < 0.001 by Student's t test.a Values are means ± S.E. for (n) animals or measurements.b p < 0.001 by Student's t test. Open table in a new tab Role of NHE1 Exchanger in Islet pHc Regulation—Previous studies, using pharmacological tools, have suggested that pHc regulation in β-cells involves unidentified HCO–3/Cl– and Na+/H+ exchangers (14Juntti-Berggren L.

Basal pHc (in 3 mm glucose) measured during the first 5 min of the experiments was not different in NHE1 mutant islets (7.03 ± 0.01, n = 175) and control islets (7.06 ± 0.01, n = 203) in HCO–3 medium, but it was lower (p < 0.001) in NHE1 mutant islets (6.78 ± 0.01, n = 117) than control islets (7.02 ± 0.01, n = 164) in HEPES medium. It should be noted, however, that basal pHc decreased with time and did so more markedly in HEPES than HCO–3 medium. Lower pHc values would thus be obtained at later times of the experiments, without affecting the comparison between NHE1 mutant and control islets.To ascertain that the lack of NHE1 was not compensated for by other pHc-regulating mechanisms, we compared the ability of control and NHE1 mutant islets to correct an intracellular acidification produced by a prepulse of NH4Cl (Fig. 2). The islets were perifused with a HCO3− medium in which both HCO3−-dependent mechanisms and Na+/H+ exchangers can function, or with a HEPES medium in which only Na+/H+ exchangers can operate. In the HCO–3 medium, the correction of the acidification was rapid in control islets and delayed in NHE1 mutant islets (Fig. 2A). Dimethylamiloride (DMA), an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchangers (27Masereel B. Pochet L. Laeckmann D. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 38: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 28Harris C. Fliegel L. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 3: 315-321PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on the correction of pHc in NHE1 mutant islets but impaired the correction in control islets, as did the mutation of NHE1 in test islets (Fig. 2B).
