https://openalex.org/W3129596738,"Natural load-bearing materials such as tendons have a high water content of about 70 per cent but are still strong and tough, even when used for over one million cycles per year, owing to the hierarchical assembly of anisotropic structures across multiple length scales1. Synthetic hydrogels have been created using methods such as electro-spinning2, extrusion3, compositing4,5, freeze-casting6,7, self-assembly8 and mechanical stretching9,10 for improved mechanical performance. However, in contrast to tendons, many hydrogels with the same high water content do not show high strength, toughness or fatigue resistance. Here we present a strategy to produce a multi-length-scale hierarchical hydrogel architecture using a freezing-assisted salting-out treatment. The produced poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels are highly anisotropic, comprising micrometre-scale honeycomb-like pore walls, which in turn comprise interconnected nanofibril meshes. These hydrogels have a water content of 70–95 per cent and properties that compare favourably to those of other tough hydrogels and even natural tendons; for example, an ultimate stress of 23.5 ± 2.7 megapascals, strain levels of 2,900 ± 450 per cent, toughness of 210 ± 13 megajoules per cubic metre, fracture energy of 170 ± 8 kilojoules per square metre and a fatigue threshold of 10.5 ± 1.3 kilojoules per square metre. The presented strategy is generalizable to other polymers, and could expand the applicability of structural hydrogels to conditions involving more demanding mechanical loading. A strategy that combines freeze-casting and salting-out treatments produces strong, tough, stretchable and fatigue-resistant poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels."
https://openalex.org/W3131861897,"Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are essential for immune tolerance1, but also drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment2. Therapeutic targeting of Treg cells in cancer will therefore require the identification of context-specific mechanisms that affect their function. Here we show that inhibiting lipid synthesis and metabolic signalling that are dependent on sterol-regulatory-element-binding proteins (SREBPs) in Treg cells unleashes effective antitumour immune responses without autoimmune toxicity. We find that the activity of SREBPs is upregulated in intratumoral Treg cells. Moreover, deletion of SREBP-cleavage-activating protein (SCAP)—a factor required for SREBP activity—in these cells inhibits tumour growth and boosts immunotherapy that is triggered by targeting the immune-checkpoint protein PD-1. These effects of SCAP deletion are associated with uncontrolled production of interferon-γ and impaired function of intratumoral Treg cells. Mechanistically, signalling through SCAP and SREBPs coordinates cellular programs for lipid synthesis and inhibitory receptor signalling in these cells. First, de novo fatty-acid synthesis mediated by fatty-acid synthase (FASN) contributes to functional maturation of Treg cells, and loss of FASN from Treg cells inhibits tumour growth. Second, Treg cells in tumours show enhanced expression of the PD-1 gene, through a process that depends on SREBP activity and signals via mevalonate metabolism to protein geranylgeranylation. Blocking PD-1 or SREBP signalling results in dysregulated activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase in intratumoral Treg cells. Our findings show that metabolic reprogramming enforces the functional specialization of Treg cells in tumours, pointing to new ways of targeting these cells for cancer therapy. Identification of a metabolic checkpoint involving lipid signalling that is specific to regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in the tumour microenvironment raises the possibility of targeting this checkpoint for treatment of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3129753608,"Stromal cells in adult bone marrow that express leptin receptor (LEPR) are a critical source of growth factors, including stem cell factor (SCF), for the maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells and early restricted progenitors1-6. LEPR+ cells are heterogeneous, including skeletal stem cells and osteogenic and adipogenic progenitors7-12, although few markers have been available to distinguish these subsets or to compare their functions. Here we show that expression of an osteogenic growth factor, osteolectin13,14, distinguishes peri-arteriolar LEPR+ cells poised to undergo osteogenesis from peri-sinusoidal LEPR+ cells poised to undergo adipogenesis (but retaining osteogenic potential). Peri-arteriolar LEPR+osteolectin+ cells are rapidly dividing, short-lived osteogenic progenitors that increase in number after fracture and are depleted during ageing. Deletion of Scf from adult osteolectin+ cells did not affect the maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells or most restricted progenitors but depleted common lymphoid progenitors, impairing lymphopoiesis, bacterial clearance, and survival after acute bacterial infection. Peri-arteriolar osteolectin+ cell maintenance required mechanical stimulation. Voluntary running increased, whereas hindlimb unloading decreased, the frequencies of peri-arteriolar osteolectin+ cells and common lymphoid progenitors. Deletion of the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1 from osteolectin+ cells depleted osteolectin+ cells and common lymphoid progenitors. These results show that a peri-arteriolar niche for osteogenesis and lymphopoiesis in bone marrow is maintained by mechanical stimulation and depleted during ageing."
https://openalex.org/W3130305184,"Mitochondrial DNA double-strand breaks (mtDSBs) are toxic lesions that compromise the integrity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and alter mitochondrial function1. Communication between mitochondria and the nucleus is essential to maintain cellular homeostasis; however, the nuclear response to mtDSBs remains unknown2. Here, using mitochondrial-targeted transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)1,3,4, we show that mtDSBs activate a type-I interferon response that involves the phosphorylation of STAT1 and activation of interferon-stimulated genes. After the formation of breaks in the mtDNA, herniation5 mediated by BAX and BAK releases mitochondrial RNA into the cytoplasm and triggers a RIG-I-MAVS-dependent immune response. We further investigated the effect of mtDSBs on interferon signalling after treatment with ionizing radiation and found a reduction in the activation of interferon-stimulated genes when cells that lack mtDNA are exposed to gamma irradiation. We also show that mtDNA breaks synergize with nuclear DNA damage to mount a robust cellular immune response. Taken together, we conclude that cytoplasmic accumulation of mitochondrial RNA is an intrinsic immune surveillance mechanism for cells to cope with mtDSBs, including breaks produced by genotoxic agents."
https://openalex.org/W3132630599,"The gut microbiota of preterm infants develops predictably1–7, with pioneer species colonizing the gut after birth, followed by an ordered succession of microorganisms. The gut microbiota is vital to the health of preterm infants8,9, but the forces that shape these predictable dynamics of microbiome assembly are unknown. The environment, the host and interactions between microorganisms all potentially shape the dynamics of the microbiota, but in such a complex ecosystem, identifying the specific role of any individual factor is challenging10–14. Here we use multi-kingdom absolute abundance quantification, ecological modelling and experimental validation to address this challenge. We quantify the absolute dynamics of bacteria, fungi and archaea in a longitudinal cohort of 178 preterm infants. We uncover microbial blooms and extinctions, and show that there is an inverse correlation between bacterial and fungal loads in the infant gut. We infer computationally and demonstrate experimentally in vitro and in vivo that predictable assembly dynamics may be driven by directed, context-dependent interactions between specific microorganisms. Mirroring the dynamics of macroscopic ecosystems15–17, a late-arriving member of the microbiome, Klebsiella, exploits the pioneer microorganism, Staphylococcus, to gain a foothold within the gut. Notably, we find that interactions between different kingdoms can influence assembly, with a single fungal species—Candida albicans—inhibiting multiple dominant genera of gut bacteria. Our work reveals the centrality of simple microbe–microbe interactions in shaping host-associated microbiota, which is critical both for our understanding of microbiota ecology and for targeted microbiota interventions. Absolute microbial abundances delineate longitudinal dynamics of bacteria, fungi and archaea in the infant gut microbiome, uncovering drivers of microbiome development masked by relative abundances and revealing notable parallels to macroscopic ecosystem assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W3129322645,"The promise of reinforcement learning is to solve complex sequential decision problems autonomously by specifying a high-level reward function only. However, reinforcement learning algorithms struggle when, as is often the case, simple and intuitive rewards provide sparse and deceptive feedback. Avoiding these pitfalls requires thoroughly exploring the environment, but creating algorithms that can do so remains one of the central challenges of the field. We hypothesise that the main impediment to effective exploration originates from algorithms forgetting how to reach previously visited states (""detachment"") and from failing to first return to a state before exploring from it (""derailment""). We introduce Go-Explore, a family of algorithms that addresses these two challenges directly through the simple principles of explicitly remembering promising states and first returning to such states before intentionally exploring. Go-Explore solves all heretofore unsolved Atari games and surpasses the state of the art on all hard-exploration games, with orders of magnitude improvements on the grand challenges Montezuma's Revenge and Pitfall. We also demonstrate the practical potential of Go-Explore on a sparse-reward pick-and-place robotics task. Additionally, we show that adding a goal-conditioned policy can further improve Go-Explore's exploration efficiency and enable it to handle stochasticity throughout training. The substantial performance gains from Go-Explore suggest that the simple principles of remembering states, returning to them, and exploring from them are a powerful and general approach to exploration, an insight that may prove critical to the creation of truly intelligent learning agents."

HR predominantly occurs in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, as sister chromatids in these phases are available to serve as repair templates. The process of HR and the HR-mediated repair of DSBs consist of three main steps, namely, end resection, strand invasion, and resolution of Holliday junctions (Haber et al., 2004Haber J.E. Ira G.

At the end-resection step, several hundred to several thousand bases are removed from the 5′-ended strand, which generates a 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhang of hundreds to thousands of nucleotides. This 3′ ssDNA overhang then invades a sister chromatid or a neighboring complementary DNA molecule for subsequent HR processes (Daley et al., 2015Daley J.M. Niu H. Miller A.S. Sung P.

The nucleases that directly participate in end resection are the CtIP-MRN (MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1) complex, DNA2 flap endonuclease, and EXO1 dsDNA exonuclease, as we know at present (Cannavo and Cejka, 2014Cannavo E.

The MRN complex (MRX in budding yeast, MRE11-RAD50-XRS2) has both endonuclease and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities (Deshpande et al., 2016Deshpande R.A. Lee J.H. Arora S. Paull T.T.

The initiation of end resection is carried out by the CtIP-MRN (or SAE2-MRX in budding yeast) complex, which removes approximately a few dozen nucleotides from the 5′-strand end (Cannavo and Cejka, 2014Cannavo E. Cejka P. Sae2 promotes dsDNA endonuclease activity within Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 to resect DNA breaks.Nature. 2014; 514: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Besides these nucleases, Sgs1 helicase in budding yeast is also involved in the resection process, because Sgs1 and Dna2 form a complex in budding yeast, and it is demonstrated that Sgs1 is responsible for unwinding the DNA to generate flap structures for Dna2 cleavage (Cejka et al., 2010Cejka P. Cannavo E. Polaczek P. Masuda-Sasa T. Pokharel S. Campbell J.L. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Sgs1 helicase and two nucleases Dna2 and Exo1 resect DNA double-strand break ends.Cell. 2008; 134: 981-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). In contrast to Sgs1 in budding yeast, Rqh1, the homolog of Sgs1 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, plays only a minor role in end resection, although it was also reported that, in a specific situation, Rqh1 functions for long-range end resection in the absence of Crb2 and Rev7 (Leland et al., 2018Leland B.A. Chen A.C. Zhao A.Y. Wharton R.C. King M.C. Rev7 and 53BP1/Crb2 prevent RecQ helicase-dependent hyper-resection of DNA double-strand breaks.eLife. 2018; 7: e33402Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We found that end resection up to 9.4 kb is not much affected in the rqh1Δ cells (Zhang et al., 2016Zhang H. Hua Y. Li R. Kong D. Cdc24 Is Essential for Long-range End Resection in the Repair of Double-stranded DNA Breaks.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 24961-24973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), which is consistent with a previous study (Langerak et al., 2011Langerak P. Mejia-Ramirez E. Limbo O. Russell P. Release of Ku and MRN from DNA ends by Mre11 nuclease activity and Ctp1 is required for homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002271Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, as in budding yeast, Dna2 and Exo1 are required for end resection in S. pombe (Zhang et al., 2016Zhang H. Hua Y. Li R. Kong D. Cdc24 Is Essential for Long-range End Resection in the Repair of Double-stranded DNA Breaks.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 24961-24973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Since S. pombe Dna2 has only a modest helicase activity (Hu et al., 2012Hu J. Sun L. Shen F. Chen Y. Hua Y. Liu Y. Zhang M. Hu Y. Wang Q. Xu W. et al.The intra-S phase checkpoint targets Dna2 to prevent stalled replication forks from reversing.Cell. 2012; 149: 1221-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), this raises the question of how flap structures, a preferred Dna2 substrate, are generated for end resection in fission yeast. It is possible that S. pombe cells may use another helicase for generating flap structures. It is equally possible that another mechanism exists in fission yeast cells to create flap structures. In metazoan or human cells, both in vitro and in vivo assays show that DNA2 and EXO1 are involved in long-range end resection at DSBs (Nimonkar et al., 2011Nimonkar A.V. Genschel J. Kinoshita E. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Wyman C. Modrich P. Kowalczykowski S.C. BLM-DNA2-RPA-MRN and EXO1-BLM-RPA-MRN constitute two DNA end resection machineries for human DNA break repair.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar; Sturzenegger et al., 2014Sturzenegger A. Burdova K. Kanagaraj R. Levikova M. Pinto C. Cejka P. Janscak P. DNA2 cooperates with the WRN and BLM RecQ helicases to mediate long-range DNA end resection in human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 27314-27326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the helicase that functions in end resection remains a matter of debate. There are five homologs of Sgs1 helicase—WRN, RECQ4, BLM, RECQL, and RECQ5β (Hickson, 2003Hickson I.D. RecQ helicases: caretakers of the genome.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Studies in Xenopus egg extracts showed that Dna2 together with WRN rather than BLM mediates DNA end resection (Liao et al., 2008Liao S. Toczylowski T. Yan H. Identification of the Xenopus DNA2 protein as a major nuclease for the 5′->3′ strand-specific processing of DNA ends.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6091-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; Yan et al., 2005Yan H. McCane J. Toczylowski T. Chen C. Analysis of the Xenopus Werner syndrome protein in DNA double-strand break repair.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, an in vitro biochemical analysis suggested that BLM, together with DNA2 and EXO1, constitutes two DNA end-resection machineries for DSB repair in human cells (Nimonkar et al., 2011Nimonkar A.V. Genschel J. Kinoshita E. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Wyman C. Modrich P. Kowalczykowski S.C. BLM-DNA2-RPA-MRN and EXO1-BLM-RPA-MRN constitute two DNA end resection machineries for human DNA break repair.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Thus, the discrepancies in the functional assays of WRN and BLM indicate that the question of whether WRN or BLM function for end resection in vivo remains open. After end resection on the 5′ strands, 3′-ssDNA overhangs are created at DSBs. RAD51 assembles onto the 3′-ssDNA overhang to form a RAD51 nucleoprotein filament. This filament then invades a homologous sequence for subsequent HR or DSB repair processes (San Filippo et al., 2008San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Mechanism of eukaryotic homologous recombination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Although much is known about the process of end resection, some critical questions still remain to be answered. Among them, the most important one is how the integrity of the 3′-ssDNA overhang is preserved during end resection. A strict protection of the 3′-ssDNA overhang is critical during the extensive resection of the 5′-ended strand(s), as an entire or even a partial removal of the 3′-ssDNA overhang will inhibit HR and potentially results in genetic loss. Three recent studies reported the observation of RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs (Li et al., 2016Li L. Germain D.R. Poon H.Y. Hildebrandt M.R. Monckton E.A. McDonald D. Hendzel M.J. Godbout R.

However, regarding the RNA-DNA hybrids at DSBs, several critical questions remain, as remarked by Aguilera and Gómez-González, 2017Aguilera A. Gómez-González B.

First, is the RNA strand at DSB just a transcript at actively transcribed region where DSB happens to occur? Second, is the RNA-DNA hybrid a repair intermediate? Third, if the RNA-DNA hybrid at DSB is actively created, which RNA polymerase is responsible for catalyzing the RNA strand synthesis? Fourth, what is the biological function of the RNA-DNA hybrids in the repair of DSBs? In this study, we found that RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) is an essential factor in the HR-mediated repair of DSBs. Moreover, we showed that the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids is an active process and the RNA-DNA hybrid is a repair intermediate in the process of HR and the HR-mediated repair of DSBs. The RNA strand in the hybrids is catalyzed by RNAPIII, and the DNA strand is the 3′-ssDNA overhang. The formation of RNA-DNA hybrids is one of the earliest events in the HR-mediated repair of DSBs. When the formation of the RNA-DNA hybrid was inhibited by either the RNAi-mediated reduction of RNAPIII or a specific chemical inhibitor, it significantly decreased the rate of HR and caused the genetic loss at DSBs, suggesting that the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids protects the 3′-ssDNA overhangs. We further demonstrated that the RNAPIII-mediated RNA synthesis plays an important role in long-range end resection, suggesting that at least some of the flap structures or the displacement of the 5′-strand results from the RNA synthesis. Furthermore, it was found that RNAPIII is actively recruited to DSBs by the MRN complex. To further understand the mechanism of HR and HR-mediated DSB repair, we undertook the search for additional HR factors. 293T cells were treated with 5 μM VP-16 (etoposide) for 3 h. Chromatin was isolated and treated with Benzonase nuclease. The chromatin fractions containing broken DNA ends and the proteins associated with them were immunoprecipitated with the antibody against MRE11, a subunit of the MRN complex. The analysis of the brought-down proteins by mass spectrometry detected, besides the known HR factors, some subunits of RNA polymerases, such as RPAC1, RPABC1 and 4, and RPC4 (Table S1). In eukaryotes, except in plants, there are three RNA polymerases, namely, RNA polymerase I, II, and III (RNAPI, II, III), which are responsible for the transcription of rRNA, mRNA, tRNA, and some small RNAs, respectively (Cramer et al., 2008Cramer P. Armache K.J. Baumli S. Benkert S. Brueckner F. Buchen C. Damsma G.E. Dengl S. Geiger S.R. Jasiak A.J. et al.Structure of eukaryotic RNA polymerases.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For RNAPI, II, or III, some subunits are commonly used (Cramer et al., 2008Cramer P. Armache K.J. Baumli S. Benkert S. Brueckner F. Buchen C. Damsma G.E. Dengl S. Geiger S.R. Jasiak A.J. et al.Structure of eukaryotic RNA polymerases.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) (Table S2). For instance, RPABC4 is the smallest subunits of RNAPII (RPB) and is also shared by the other two DNA-directed RNA polymerases-RNAPI (RPA) and III (RPC). RPAC1 is the largest common subunit used by RNAPI and III, while RPC4 is RNAPIII-specific subunit. To determine whether an RNA polymerase(s) indeed localizes to DSBs, fluorescence assays were conducted. First, RPAC1, RPABC4, and RPC4 subunits detected by MRN immunoprecipitation (IP) were examined. The EGFP-tagged RPAC1, RPABC4, and RPC4 were individually expressed in U2OS cells. As shown in Figure 1A, the EGFP-tagged subunits RPABC4, RPAC1, and RPC4 were localized to DSBs, and their fluorescence signals clearly overlapped with γH2AX (H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139). This result confirms that RPABC4, RPAC1, and RPC4 are indeed localized to DSBs. This result also suggests that an RNA polymerase may actively localize to DSBs. To determine whether all three RNA polymerases or only one of them is localized to DSBs, the presence of RPA1, RPB1, and RPC1 (the catalytic subunit of RNAPI, II, and III, respectively) at DSBs was examined. The results revealed, as shown in Figure 1B, that RPC1 localized to DSBs, whereas RPA1 and RPB1 did not. The fluorescence assays in real time also indicated that RPC3, 4, 6, and 7 subunits of RNAPIII localized to DSBs (Figure 1C). Additionally, RPABC1 and 4 (the subunits shared by RNAPI, II, and III) were localized to DSBs, but RPB3 (a subunit belonging to only RNAPII) did not (Figures S1A and S1B). These results suggest that only RNAPIII localizes to DSBs. Furthermore, the RPC1 immuno-staining signal was detected during the first minute after DNA breaks and quickly rose to a maximum level at around the fifth minute (Figure 1D). As shown in Figure 1C, in living cells, EGFP-tagged RPC3, 4, 6, and 7 localized to DSBs within the first minute after laser irradiation. In Figure S1C, more living cells showed the localization of RPC3, 4, 6, and 7 to DSBs in real time. The statistics shown in Figure S1C indicate the relative increase of EGFP-RPC3 or -RPC6 fluorescence at laser stripe over time and the ratio of examined cells showing RPC3, 4, 6, and 7 localized to DSBs. Taken together, these results suggest that RNAPIII is localized to DSBs, and it occurs during the very early stage of the DSB repair process. Using a similar assay, NBS1 (a subunit of MRN) and RPA32 (a subunit of RPA) were found at DSBs within the first minute after irradiation (Figures S1D and S1E). We also found that the chromatin level of the RNAPIII-specific subunit RPC7 remarkably increases in cells treated with the DSB-inducing agent Camptothecin (CPT) or etoposide (VP-16), as shown in Figure 1E, which further supports that RNAPIII localizes to DSBs. Additionally, using a single clean I-SceI-generated DSB site, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR analysis further confirmed that RNAPIII localizes to DSBs. The construction of a 3FLAG-tagged RPC3 cell line using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique is shown in the schematic in Figure 1F. Three independent homozygous cell lines were obtained, and they showed similar growth rate compared to wild-type (WT) cells (data not shown). An IP assay showed the interaction of 3FLAG-RPC3 and RPC7, and a ChIP assay demonstrated the enrichment of 3FLAG-RPC3 in the 5S RNA and tRNATyr genomic regions in which RNAP III catalyzes transcription (Figure 1G). These results indicated that 3FLAG-RPC3 is able to integrate into the RNAPIII complex. The results in Figure 1H reveal that RNAPIII (RPC3) was enriched at the I-SceI break site. However, RNAPI (RPA1) and II (RPB1) were not enriched at the I-SceI break site, as indicated by the lack of statistically significant difference between the association of RPA1 or RPB1 with the I-SceI site before and after DNA break (Figure 1H). Additionally, the results in Figure 1H also indicate that a certain amount of RNAPII (RPB1 subunit) may exist near the I-SceI break site, which is consistent with the ubiquitous presence of RNAPII on chromatin, as required for mRNA transcription. The enrichment of RPC3 at AsisI break sites located in non-transcription regions (compacted chromatin) was also detected (Figure 1I). These results indicate that RNAPIII localizes to DSBs in both euchromatin and heterochromatin regions. Immunostaining analysis of γ-H2AX, Cyclin A2, and RPC1 in laser micro-irradiated cells revealed, as shown in Figure 1J, that RPC1 signal co-localized with γH2AX signal in both cyclin A2 (S/G2-phase-specific cyclin)-positive and -negative cells. This suggests that RNAPIII is recruited to DSBs in cells at the G1, S, and G2 phases. Taken together, these results indicate that RNAPIII, but not RNAPI and II, localizes to DSBs independent of the cell-cycle phase.Figure S1Localization of RPABC1, RPABC4, NBS1, CtIP, and RPA to DSBs, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Detection in real-time of EGFP-RPABC1 and EGFP-RPABC4 localized to DSBs.

The specific or shared subunits for RNA polymerase I, II and III are indicated by “∗, ∗∗, ∗∗∗” symbol. Considering that RNAPIII localizes to DSBs, it is reasonable to anticipate that the biochemical function of RNAIII at DSBs is to catalyze RNA synthesis. Using the uracil analog 5-ethynyl uridine (5-EU) incorporation assay, newly synthesized RNAs were detected at the laser micro-irradiated stripe, which is co-localized with γH2AX (Figures 2A and S2A). We refer to this newly synthesized RNA as DSB-RNA (DNA double-strand break RNA). To determine whether the DSB-RNA is associated with a complementary DNA strand to form RNA-DNA hybrids, a fluorescence assay was performed using S9.6 antibody, a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes RNA-DNA hybrids (Boguslawski et al., 1986Boguslawski S.J. Smith D.E. Michalak M.A. Mickelson K.E. Yehle C.O. Patterson W.L. Carrico R.J. Characterization of monoclonal antibody to DNA.RNA and its application to immunodetection of hybrids.J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The result in Figure 2B shows that RNA-DNA hybrids were formed at DSBs, and their signal clearly overlaps with γH2AX (Figure 2B). The formation of RNA-DNA hybrids was further examined in living cells in real-time mode, using an EGFP-HB-NLS fusion protein to recognize and detect RNA-DNA hybrids. Adding a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to EGFP-HB (a RNase H1-derived RNA-DNA hybrids binding domain fused to EGFP) remarkably increases the localization of EGFP-HB in the nucleus and considerably enhances the resolution of its fluorescence signal, compared with the only HB domain reported previously (Bhatia et"

Refining strategies to translate genome editing to the clinic.Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Before applying genome editing in transplantable cells or in vivo, however, engineered nucleases need to be evaluated carefully with respect to their activity and specificity. Both parameters are fundamental for safe translation to maintain the genome integrity of edited cells and reduce the risk of oncogenic transformation, often referred to as genotoxicity (Kim et al., 2019Kim D. Luk K. Wolfe S.A. Kim J.S. Evaluating and Enhancing Target Specificity of Gene-Editing Nucleases and Deaminases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2019; 88: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar; Tsai and Joung, 2016Tsai S.Q. Joung J.K. Defining and improving the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Designer nuclease-induced off-target (OT) activity can lead to short insertion or deletion (indel) mutations, large chromosomal deletions and inversions, as well as chromosomal translocations. Much effort has been invested in increasing the safety of genome editing tools in the past years, leading to better designer nuclease platforms with improved specificities (Kim et al., 2019Kim D. Luk K. Wolfe S.A. Kim J.S. Evaluating and Enhancing Target Specificity of Gene-Editing Nucleases and Deaminases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2019; 88: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar; Tsai and Joung, 2016Tsai S.Q. Joung J.K. Defining and improving the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a thorough preclinical assessment of their specificity is a requirement that is clearly stated by the regulatory authorities (Cathomen et al., 2019Cathomen T. Schüle S. Schüßler-Lenz M. Abou-El-Enein M. The Human Genome Editing Race: Loosening Regulatory Standards for Commercial Advantage?.Trends Biotechnol. 2019; 37: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ideally, the applied tests combine high sensitivity with high specificity and allow scientists not only to measure designer nuclease-induced mutagenesis but also chromosomal aberrations (Kim et al., 2019Kim D. Luk K. Wolfe S.A. Kim J.S. Evaluating and Enhancing Target Specificity of Gene-Editing Nucleases and Deaminases.Annu. Rev.

Genet. 2016; 17: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Computer-based prediction algorithms (in silico methods), in vitro tests, and cell-based assays rely on next-generation sequencing (NGS) and are typically employed in a two-step process: a predictive “screening test” is used first to identify potential OT sites, followed by a “confirmatory test” to validate the predictions in the gene-edited, clinically relevant cell type. In silico prediction algorithms are based on well-defined parameters, including similarity to the target sequence (Kim et al., 2019Kim D. Luk K. Wolfe S.A. Kim J.S.

They are a fast and cheap screening method but often miss critical OT sites (Ran et al., 2015Ran F.A. Cong L. Yan W.X. Scott D.A. Gootenberg J.S. Kriz A.J. Zetsche B. Shalem O. Wu X.

In vitro methods tend to be highly sensitive for detecting genomic sites that are cleaved in vitro, but a large proportion of those in vitro OT sites cannot be confirmed in gene-edited cells (Kim et al., 2019Kim D.

Cell-based assays such as BLISS, DISCOVER-Seq, and GUIDE-Seq detect OT sites by tagging the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) created by the engineered nuclease by different means. They seem to be specific and sensitive but do not identify gross chromosomal aberrations induced by programmable nucleases (Kosicki et al., 2018Kosicki M. Tomberg K. Bradley A.

These methods are based on linker-mediated (LM) or linear amplification-mediated (LAM) PCR (Mueller and Wold, 1989Mueller P.R. Wold B.

Methods. 2007; 4: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and identify translocation events to the known on-target site. However, these methods do not meet all criteria for clinical assessment of samples because of their low or unknown sensitivity, semiquantitative nature, and a partially biased analysis that identifies only particular types of genomic aberrations (see the comparison of CAST-Seq with AMP-Seq, HTGTS, and UDiTaS in Table S1). To overcome these limitations, we established chromosomal aberrations analysis by single targeted LM PCR sequencing (CAST-Seq). CAST-Seq exploits locus-specific decoy primers that decrease the background noise and allow us to identify, with high sensitivity, OT-mediated translocations (OMTs) as well as chromosomal aberrations mediated by on-target activity of designer nucleases. The latter group includes large deletions and inversions at the target site as well as chromosomal rearrangements that we called homology-mediated translocations (HMTs). HMTs are an alternative class of chromosomal aberrations mediated by a homologous recombination (HR)-based mechanism. Moreover, CAST-Seq is a quantitative assay that is performed directly in the clinically relevant cell type, making NGS-based confirmatory tests redundant. Depending on the designer nuclease and the target site, chromosomal rearrangements occurred in up to 1.6% of edited stem cells, and up to 20% of on-target loci harbored large deletions or other chromosomal aberrations. Various chromosomal rearrangements can be induced by nuclease activity at the on-target and/or OT sites (Figure 1A). Cleavage at on-target and OT sites induces large (>250 bp) deletions/inversions at the cleavage sites as well as OMTs with a balanced or unbalanced outcome. Moreover, we postulated that on-target cleavage will induce HR-based HMT events between the on-target site and a locus that shares a certain degree of homology with the on-target region. CAST-Seq was developed to identify and quantify these chromosomal aberrations with high sensitivity by mapping the chromosomal sequences fused to one arm of the target site (Figure 1B). First, the genomic DNA was fragmented to an average length of 350 bp, followed by linker ligation and three PCR steps. The first PCR reaction was performed with a “bait primer” binding to the on-target sequence, a “prey primer” that recognizes the linker sequence, and “decoy primers” that bind the target sequence to prevent on-target amplification (Figure 1B; Figures S1A–S1D). Only when the binding sites of the decoy primers were lost because of translocations or large deletions at the on-target site would the second and third PCR steps amplify the full-length product between bait and prey primers to introduce adapters and barcode sequences for NGS (Figure 1B). Use of decoy primers substantially reduced background and increased the sensitivity of CAST-Seq by approximately 5-fold (Figure S1E). All data reported in this study were produced in primary CD34-positive human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). CRISPR-Cas nucleases, comprising a wild type and a high-fidelity (HiFi) variant of Cas9 (Vakulskas et al., 2018Vakulskas C.A. Dever D.P. Rettig G.R. Turk R. Jacobi A.M. Collingwood M.A. Bode N.M.

Genome-wide detection of DNA double-stranded breaks induced by engineered nucleases.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Moreover, a TALEN targeting the HBB locus was included (Patsali et al., 2019Patsali P. Turchiano G. Papasavva P. Romito M. Loucari C.C. Stephanou C. Christou S. Sitarou M. Mussolino C. Cornu T.I. et al.Correction of IVS I-110(G>A) β-thalassemia by CRISPR/Cas-and TALEN-mediated disruption of aberrant regulatory elements in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.Haematologica. 2019; 104: e497-e501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cells were pre-activated for 2 days before electroporating CRISPR-Cas nucleases as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes or TALENs in the form of mRNA (Figure 1C). Genomic DNA was collected at different time points to evaluate the kinetics and dynamics of DNA repair and chromosomal alterations. On-target activity, as measured by indel formation, was in the range of 48%–89%, with cell viabilities ranging from 70%–99% (Figures 1D and 1E; Figures S1F and S1G). An original bioinformatics pipeline was developed to map the chromosomal regions that were fused to the target site as a result of chromosomal rearrangements (Figure S2A; STAR methods). Because the DNA ends of a nuclease-induced DSB can be processed differently before translocation (Chiarle et al., 2011Chiarle R. Zhang Y. Frock R.L. Lewis S.M. Molinie B. Ho Y.J. Myers D.R. Choi V.W.

Spatial dynamics of chromosome translocations in living cells.Science. 2013; 341: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the distinctive translocation fusion points, together with the linker ligation points, were used as a “unique molecular signature” to compute the number of individual translocation events, called “hits.” An in silico library of 10,000 random reads was created to define the statistical likelihood of two or more hits falling in the same “cluster.” Subsequently, consecutive hits separated by less than 2,500 bp were merged into clusters, representing all putative translocation sites mediated by the same trigger (p < 0.05; Figure S2B). To classify these events as OMTs or HMTs, the region surrounding the fusion point was screened for the presence of sequences that share homology with the 23-bp target site (OMT; Figure S2C) or that contain a stretch of at least 25 bp of homology with the on-target region within a 5-kb window (HMT; Figure S2D). A 25-bp homology stretch has been reported to be sufficient to mediate HR in mammalian cells (Ayares et al., 1986Ayares D. Chekuri L. Song K.Y. Kucherlapati R. Sequence homology requirements for intermolecular recombination in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1986; 83: 5199-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For some events, both criteria were met (ambiguous OMT/HMT annotation). When neither an OT nor a homology stretch could be identified, the chromosomal aberration was considered to be prompted by a natural break site (NBS). The classification was verified by targeted deep amplicon sequencing of some of the sites (Table S2). All hits reported in this study were identified in at least two CAST-Seq replicates. For most targeted loci, different time points were analyzed. Genomic DNA extracted from CD34+ cells nucleofected with an RNP targeting CCR5 target site #1 (CCR5#1) was subjected to CAST-Seq, which included two decoy primers (Figure 2A). CAST-Seq for CCR51 (and CCR5#2, see below) was performed in two sequencing orientations, with the bait primer on the telomeric (Tel) or centromeric (Cen) side of the DSB. Most chromosomal aberration events were identified in both orientations (Table S2). A qualitative and quantitative examination revealed that most retrieved CAST-Seq hits included chromosomal aberrations within CCR5#1 (i.e., large deletions or inversions) as well as acentric and dicentric translocations with the homologous chromosome within an ∼15-kb region surrounding the on-target site (Figures 2B and 2C; Figures S3A–S3C). The second most frequent class of events involved large, ∼15-kb deletions between CCR5 and an ambiguous OMT/HMT site in the CCR2 locus. Targeted deep sequencing revealed that the number of indels at the CCR2 site did not differ significantly from untreated controls (Figure 2S; Table S2), indicating that the observed chromosomal aberrations were induced by HMT and not OMT. Further sequencing confirmed indels at CCR5#1 (>80%) as well as at the identified five OMT sites and one ambiguous OMT/HMT site (ranging from 0.2%–11%), confirming that those events represent OMTs (Figures 2C and 2D; Table S2). For three of the six sites, indel frequencies were significantly (p < 0.01) lower when HiFi Cas9 was used (Figure 2D; Table S2). CAST-Seq also exposed rare, rather complex repair outcomes where small portions of target region sequences were duplicated and/or inverted or partial sequence insertions from homologous regions (i.e., CCR2) were observed (Figure 2E). A Circos plot summarizes the CAST-Seq results (in Tel orientation) and indicates classification and locations of the chromosomal rearrangements (Figure 2F). The relationship between the number of CAST-Seq hits for CCR5#1 on days 1 and 4 (Table S2) and the number of absolute translocation events on days 1 and 4, respectively, was determined by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.94 (p = 1.08 × 10−7) and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.88 (p = 7.28 × 10−6) confirmed a linear correlation between CAST-Seq hits and actual translocations (Figure 2G). Furthermore, they allowed us to infer that one CAST-Seq hit corresponds to about five (4.67) factual chromosomal aberration events. Based on the number of input genomes (∼150,000 haploid genomes in 500 ng of DNA) and the relation between CAST-Seq hits and actual chromosomal rearrangements, we calculated the absolute number of rearrangements per cell, which amounted to 1.6% of affected alleles for the CCR5/CCR2 HMT and 0.01%–0.5% of alleles for the four CCR5#1 OMTs (Figure 2G). These data further show that the number of translocations decrease over time (day 1 versus day 4; see below) or can be reduced by using a HiFi variant of Cas9 (e.g., translocation of CCR5 with chromosome 13). The limit of detection of CAST-Seq is in the range of 1 chromosomal aberration per 10,000 cells. To substantiate the HMT phenomena, we included a TALEN pair targeting HBB in proximity to the related HBD locus (Patsali et al., 2019Patsali P. Turchiano G. Papasavva P. Romito M. Loucari C.C. Stephanou C. Christou S. Sitarou M. Mussolino C. Cornu T.I. et al.Correction of IVS I-110(G>A) β-thalassemia by CRISPR/Cas-and TALEN-mediated disruption of aberrant regulatory elements in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.Haematologica. 2019; 104: e497-e501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and designed a second guide RNA (gRNA) targeting CCR5 (CCR5#2) in a region that differs more substantially from the CCR2 paralog sequence. CAST-Seq analysis was also performed on CD34+ cell samples edited with CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases targeting sites in FANCF, VEGFA, and RAG1 (Frock et al., 2015Frock R.L. Hu J. Meyers R.M. Ho Y.J. Kii E.

All analyses were performed with CAST-Seq bait primers on the Cen side of the on-target site. The TALEN pair targeting HBB induced aberrations at the on-target site, including ∼6-kb deletions between HBB and the closely related HBD locus (Figure 3A; Table S2). Genomic DNA of cells edited with the CCR5#2 nuclease were analyzed from both orientations. The CCR5#2-editing CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease was more specific than the nuclease targeting CCR5#1 because only rearrangements around the on-target site were detected (Figure 3B). These aberrations likely represent large deletions because no indels were confirmed for those OMT sites (Table S2). Importantly, we also observed a notably reduced amount of HMT hits with CCR2 compared with the CCR5#1-targeting CRISPR nuclease (Table S2). To corroborate that HMT is mediated by the HR machinery, K562 cells were nucleofected with CCR5#1-targeting RNPs or HBB TALEN-encoding mRNA in the presence or absence of B02, a well-characterized inhibitor of RAD51 (Huang et al., 2011Huang F.

https://openalex.org/W3133363512,"The ability to rapidly adapt to novel situations is essential for survival, and this flexibility is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders1. Thus, understanding whether and how novelty prepares, or primes, brain circuitry to facilitate cognitive flexibility has important translational relevance. Exposure to novelty recruits the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)2 and may prime hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry for subsequent learning-associated plasticity. Here we show that novelty resets the neural circuits that link the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and the mPFC, facilitating the ability to overcome an established strategy. Exposing mice to novelty disrupted a previously encoded strategy by reorganizing vHPC activity to local theta (4-12 Hz) oscillations and weakening existing vHPC-mPFC connectivity. As mice subsequently adapted to a new task, vHPC neurons developed new task-associated activity, vHPC-mPFC connectivity was strengthened, and mPFC neurons updated to encode the new rules. Without novelty, however, mice adhered to their established strategy. Blocking dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) or inhibiting novelty-tagged cells that express D1Rs in the vHPC prevented these behavioural and physiological effects of novelty. Furthermore, activation of D1Rs mimicked the effects of novelty. These results suggest that novelty promotes adaptive learning by D1R-mediated resetting of vHPC-mPFC circuitry, thereby enabling subsequent learning-associated circuit plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3131611635,"Quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum computation and quantum communication \cite{Nielsen2010}. Scaling to large quantum communication or computation networks further requires the deterministic generation of multi-qubit entanglement \cite{Gottesman1999,Duan2001,Jiang2007}. The deterministic entanglement of two remote qubits has recently been demonstrated with microwave photons \cite{Kurpiers2018,Axline2018,Campagne2018,Leung2019,Zhong2019}, optical photons \cite{Humphreys2018} and surface acoustic wave phonons \cite{Bienfait2019}. However, the deterministic generation and transmission of multi-qubit entanglement has not been demonstrated, primarily due to limited state transfer fidelities. Here, we report a quantum network comprising two separate superconducting quantum nodes connected by a 1 meter-long superconducting coaxial cable, where each node includes three interconnected qubits. By directly connecting the coaxial cable to one qubit in each node, we can transfer quantum states between the nodes with a process fidelity of $0.911\pm0.008$. Using the high-fidelity communication link, we can prepare a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state \cite{Greenberger1990,Neeley2010,Dicarlo2010} in one node and deterministically transfer this state to the other node, with a transferred state fidelity of $0.656\pm 0.014$. We further use this system to deterministically generate a two-node, six-qubit GHZ state, globally distributed within the network, with a state fidelity of $0.722\pm0.021$. The GHZ state fidelities are clearly above the threshold of $1/2$ for genuine multipartite entanglement \cite{Guhne2010}, and show that this architecture can be used to coherently link together multiple superconducting quantum processors, providing a modular approach for building large-scale quantum computers \cite{Monroe2014,Chou2018}."
https://openalex.org/W3134903290,"The fundamental building blocks of the proton-quarks and gluons-have been known for decades. However, we still have an incomplete theoretical and experimental understanding of how these particles and their dynamics give rise to the quantum bound state of the proton and its physical properties, such as its spin1. The two up quarks and the single down quark that comprise the proton in the simplest picture account only for a few per cent of the proton mass, the bulk of which is in the form of quark kinetic and potential energy and gluon energy from the strong force2. An essential feature of this force, as described by quantum chromodynamics, is its ability to create matter-antimatter quark pairs inside the proton that exist only for a very short time. Their fleeting existence makes the antimatter quarks within protons difficult to study, but their existence is discernible in reactions in which a matter-antimatter quark pair annihilates. In this picture of quark-antiquark creation by the strong force, the probability distributions as a function of momentum for the presence of up and down antimatter quarks should be nearly identical, given that their masses are very similar and small compared to the mass of the proton3. Here we provide evidence from muon pair production measurements that these distributions are considerably different, with more abundant down antimatter quarks than up antimatter quarks over a wide range of momenta. These results are expected to revive interest in several proposed mechanisms for the origin of this antimatter asymmetry in the proton that had been disfavoured by previous results4, and point to future measurements that can distinguish between these mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W3131776733,"Animal nervous system organization is crucial for all body functions and its disruption can lead to severe cognitive and behavioural impairment1. This organization relies on features across scales-from the localization of synapses at the nanoscale, through neurons, which possess intricate neuronal morphologies that underpin circuit organization, to stereotyped connections between different regions of the brain2. The sheer complexity of this organ means that the feat of reconstructing and modelling the structure of a complete nervous system that is integrated across all of these scales has yet to be achieved. Here we present a complete structure-function model of the main neuropil in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans-the nerve ring-which we derive by integrating the volumetric reconstructions from two animals with corresponding3 synaptic and gap-junctional connectomes. Whereas previously the nerve ring was considered to be a densely packed tract of neural processes, we uncover internal organization and show how local neighbourhoods spatially constrain and support the synaptic connectome. We find that the C. elegans connectome is not invariant, but that a precisely wired core circuit is embedded in a background of variable connectivity, and identify a candidate reference connectome for the core circuit. Using this reference, we propose a modular network architecture of the C. elegans brain that supports sensory computation and integration, sensorimotor convergence and brain-wide coordination. These findings reveal scalable and robust features of brain organization that may be universal across phyla."
https://openalex.org/W3130420029,"When a heavy atomic nucleus splits (fission), the resulting fragments are observed to emerge spinning1; this phenomenon has been a mystery in nuclear physics for over 40 years2,3. The internal generation of typically six or seven units of angular momentum in each fragment is particularly puzzling for systems that start with zero, or almost zero, spin. There are currently no experimental observations that enable decisive discrimination between the many competing theories for the mechanism that generates the angular momentum4–12. Nevertheless, the consensus is that excitation of collective vibrational modes generates the intrinsic spin before the nucleus splits (pre-scission). Here we show that there is no significant correlation between the spins of the fragment partners, which leads us to conclude that angular momentum in fission is actually generated after the nucleus splits (post-scission). We present comprehensive data showing that the average spin is strongly mass-dependent, varying in saw-tooth distributions. We observe no notable dependence of fragment spin on the mass or charge of the partner nucleus, confirming the uncorrelated post-scission nature of the spin mechanism. To explain these observations, we propose that the collective motion of nucleons in the ruptured neck of the fissioning system generates two independent torques, analogous to the snapping of an elastic band. A parameterization based on occupation of angular momentum states according to statistical theory describes the full range of experimental data well. This insight into the role of spin in nuclear fission is not only important for the fundamental understanding and theoretical description of fission, but also has consequences for the γ-ray heating problem in nuclear reactors13,14, for the study of the structure of neutron-rich isotopes15,16, and for the synthesis and stability of super-heavy elements17,18. γ-ray spectroscopy experiments on the origin of spin in the products of nuclear fission of spin-zero nuclei suggest that the fission fragments acquire their spin after scission, rather than before."
https://openalex.org/W3132258178,"<h2>Summary</h2> A prerequisite for intelligent behavior is to understand how stimuli are related and to generalize this knowledge across contexts. Generalization can be challenging when relational patterns are shared across contexts but exist on different physical scales. Here, we studied neural representations in humans and recurrent neural networks performing a magnitude comparison task, for which it was advantageous to generalize concepts of ""more"" or ""less"" between contexts. Using multivariate analysis of human brain signals and of neural network hidden unit activity, we observed that both systems developed parallel neural ""number lines"" for each context. In both model systems, these number state spaces were aligned in a way that explicitly facilitated generalization of relational concepts (more and less). These findings suggest a previously overlooked role for neural normalization in supporting transfer of a simple form of abstract relational knowledge (magnitude) in humans and machine learning systems."

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a member of the Betaherpesvirinae sub-family of Herpesviridae that establishes a life-long infection in more than 70% of the human population (Ho, 1990Ho M. Epidemiology of cytomegalovirus infections.Rev. Infect. Dis. 1990; 12: S701-S710Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). After primary infection, HCMV becomes latent and its reactivation causes severe morbidity and mortality in individuals who are immune-suppressed or undergoing organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Gallant et al., 1992Gallant J.E. Moore R.D. Richman D.D. Keruly J. Chaisson Incidence and natural history of cytomegalovirus disease in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease treated with zidovudine.J. Infect.

HCMV is also particularly threatening during pregnancy due to its ability to cross the placental barrier and infect the fetus. HCMV infection affects 0.3%–2.3% of newborns, representing the leading viral cause of congenital birth defects, including brain damage, hearing loss, learning disabilities, heart diseases, and mental retardation (Hyde et al., 2010Hyde T.B. Schmid D.S. Cannon M.J. Cytomegalovirus seroconversion rates and risk factors: implications for congenital CMV.Rev. Med. Virol. 2010; 20: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For these reasons, HCMV has been identified as a top priority disease target by the Institute of Medicine (Schleiss, 2011Schleiss M.R. Could therapeutic vaccination of cytomegalovirus-seropositive persons prevent reinfection and congenital virus transmission?.J. Infect. Dis. 2011; 203: 1513-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). During the past decades, significant efforts have been established to develop vaccine candidates against HCMV infection. However, results from recent clinical trials indicated that HCMV vaccines showed only modest efficacy in preventing viral infection (Anderholm et al., 2016Anderholm K.M. Bierle C.J. Schleiss M.R. Cytomegalovirus Vaccines: Current Status and Future Prospects.Drugs. 2016; 76: 1625-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against HCMV represents an important unmet medical need. An effective vaccine or anti-viral therapeutic should target the early steps of the HCMV infection cycle, including viral entry into host-cells. The HCMV cell entry process can be described in two steps: receptor binding and membrane fusion (Nguyen and Kamil, 2018Nguyen C.C. Kamil J.P. Pathogen at the gates: Human cytomegalovirus entry and cell tropism.Viruses. 2018; 10: E704Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HCMV uses three envelope glycoprotein complexes to enter different cell lines: the gHgLgO (Trimer) and the gHgLpUL128-131A (Pentamer), as well as glycoprotein B (gB) (Sinzger, 2008Sinzger C. Entry route of HCMV into endothelial cells.J. Clin. Virol. 2008; 41: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HCMV Trimer or Pentamer binding to cellular host receptors provide the triggering signal for the HCMV glycoprotein gB to catalyze membrane fusion between the virus and infected cells, through an unknown mechanism (Nguyen and Kamil, 2018Nguyen C.C. Kamil J.P. Pathogen at the gates: Human cytomegalovirus entry and cell tropism.Viruses. 2018; 10: E704Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This fusion allows HCMV to enter cells, replicate, and establish its latency. HCMV exhibits a broad cellular tropism, including fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, neurons, epithelial, and endothelial cells (Sinzger, 2008Sinzger C. Entry route of HCMV into endothelial cells.J. Clin.

Although recent evidence suggested a primary role of the trimer complex for the infection of all cell types (Stegmann et al., 2017Stegmann C. Hochdorfer D. Lieber D. Subramanian N. Stöhr D. Laib Sampaio K. Sinzger C.

In addition, TGFβR3 was found to bind the HCMV Trimer with high affinity, representing an additional putative cellular receptor mediating HCMV broad tropism (Martinez-Martin et al., 2018Martinez-Martin N.

Importantly, highly potent neutralizing antibodies targeting HCMV have been isolated from the memory B cell repertoire of HCMV immune donors (Macagno et al., 2010Macagno A. Bernasconi N.L. Vanzetta F. Dander E. Sarasini A. Revello M.G. Gerna G. Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. Isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that potently neutralize human cytomegalovirus infection by targeting different epitopes on the gH/gL/UL128-131A complex.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Most recently, high-throughput screening of 9,000 HCMV-seropositive blood donors identified exceptionally potent neutralizing antibodies able to block infection in fibroblasts and thought to be particularly active against the HCMV Trimer (Falk et al., 2018Falk J.J. Winkelmann M. Stöhr D. Alt M. Schrezenmeier H. Krawczyk A. Lotfi R. Sinzger C.

Dis. 2018; 218: 876-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The identification of these potent trimer neutralizing antibodies together with the requirement of the trimer for HCMV infection into all cell types (Liu et al., 2018Liu J. Jardetzky T.S. Chin A.L. Johnson D.C. Vanarsdall A.L. The Human Cytomegalovirus Trimer and Pentamer Promote Sequential Steps in Entry into Epithelial and Endothelial Cells at Cell Surfaces and Endosomes.J. Virol. 2018; 92: e01336-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) highlights the key importance of the trimer for HCMV infection and suggests targeting the trimer for vaccine and anti-viral therapeutic development. While opening new paths for targeting HCMV, the discovery of new HCMV receptors has highlighted the need for structural information identifying key regions on these complexes involved in receptor recognition and HCMV neutralization. In the past, mass spectrometry or negative staining electron microscopy were used to characterize the architecture of the trimer and pentamer at low resolution (Ciferri et al., 2015aCiferri C. Chandramouli S. Donnarumma D. Nikitin P.A. Cianfrocco M.A. Gerrein R. Feire A.L. Barnett S.W. Lilja A.E. Rappuoli R. et al.Structural and biochemical studies of HCMV gH/gL/gO and Pentamer reveal mutually exclusive cell entry complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 1767-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of the pentamer has been determined recently (Chandramouli et al., 2017Chandramouli S. Malito E. Nguyen T. Luisi K. Donnarumma D. Xing Y. Norais N. Yu D. Carfi A. Structural basis for potent antibody-mediated neutralization of human cytomegalovirus.Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2: eaan1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), high-resolution structures of the trimer as well as any receptor bound to HCMV glycoprotein complexes are still elusive. Here, we utilized cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle reconstruction to determine the high-resolution structure of HCMV Trimer bound to two broadly neutralizing antibodies. The structure provides a detailed view of trimer organization, and in particular of the architecture of the gO subunit, highlighting differences between the trimer and pentamer and providing insights into HCMV broad neutralization. Furthermore, we determined the high-resolution structures of Trimer-PDGFRα and Trimer-TGFβR3 complexes and provide structural insights for the high affinity and specificity of interactions required for HCMV receptor recognition. We find that the trimer interaction with PDGFRα and TGFβR3 receptors is mutually exclusive, indicating that they do not function as co-receptors, but rather they might function as independent entry receptors. We further show that the trimer competes with the PDGF-AA growth factor for binding to PDGFRα and prevents activation of PDGFRα and the intracellular signaling cascade. We discuss potential consequences of using the HCMV Trimer itself as anti-viral therapeutic by assaying PDGFRα activation and signaling in fibroblasts. Taken together, we present the structural basis for HCMV Trimer-receptor recognition and provide a framework for the design of effective HCMV Trimer vaccines and therapeutics. To determine the high-resolution structure of HCMV Trimer, we recombinantly expressed the soluble region of gHgLgO complex in Expi293F cells and purified the complex to high purity (Figure S1A). Consistent with previous reports, HCMV gH, gL, and gO were covalently linked by disulfide bonds and ran as a single band by SDS-PAGE (Figure S1B) (Ciferri et al., 2015aCiferri C. Chandramouli S. Donnarumma D. Nikitin P.A. Cianfrocco M.A. Gerrein R. Feire A.L. Barnett S.W. Lilja A.E. Rappuoli R. et al.Structural and biochemical studies of HCMV gH/gL/gO and Pentamer reveal mutually exclusive cell entry complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 1767-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). HCMV gHgLgO structural characterization has proven challenging in the past due to its flexibility, elongated nature, and its numerous glycosylation sites, likely hampering the formation of crystals that diffract to high-resolution (Ciferri et al., 2015aCiferri C. Chandramouli S. Donnarumma D. Nikitin P.A. Cianfrocco M.A. Gerrein R. Feire A.L. Barnett S.W. Lilja A.E. Rappuoli R. et al.Structural and biochemical studies of HCMV gH/gL/gO and Pentamer reveal mutually exclusive cell entry complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 1767-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To overcome these limitations we turned to cryo-EM and single particle analysis after reconstituting gHgLgO with the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) regions of the gH-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 13H11 and MSL-109 (Figures S1A–S1I) (Fouts et al., 2014Fouts A.E. Comps-Agrar L. Stengel K.F. Ellerman D. Schoeffler A.J. Warming S. Eaton D.L. Feierbach B. Mechanism for neutralizing activity by the anti-CMV gH/gL monoclonal antibody MSL-109.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 8209-8214Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; Macagno et al., 2010Macagno A. Bernasconi N.L. Vanzetta F. Dander E. Sarasini A. Revello M.G. Gerna G. Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. Isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that potently neutralize human cytomegalovirus infection by targeting different epitopes on the gH/gL/UL128-131A complex.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Binding of both Fabs increased the stability and dimensions of the gHgLgO complex and facilitated cryo-EM investigation (Figures S1C and S1D). Two-dimensional class averages showed a high degree of detail including secondary structure features and particles imaged in numerous different orientations (Figure S1D). Additionally, we noticed a subpopulation of dimeric gHgLgO particles in the 2D classes and 3D ab initio volumes (Figures S1D and S1E), orientated head-to-tail in opposing directions with only a few small contact regions at the interface. The head-to-tail orientation of these particles, corresponding to a positioning of viral membranes at opposing ends of the complex, and the fact that these dimers form only at high concentration, suggested that trimer dimerization might not be of physiological relevance. We then determined the high-resolution structure of the single gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 complex that extended to a resolution of ∼2.9 Å, (Figures 1A and S1F–S1I; Table S1). We divided the complex into three sub-regions to further improve the map quality across the entire gHgLgO-13H11-MSL-109 molecule using specific masks in focused local refinements (Figure S1F). The combination of the focused 3D reconstructions allowed us to build a structural model of the majority of the sequences of the gH, gL, and the previously unknown gO subunits as well as the variable domains (Fv) of both Fabs (Figures 1A and 1B).Figure 1Structure of HCMV Trimer gHgLgOShow full caption(A) Overall cryo-EM map of HCMV gHgLgO Trimer complex bound to neutralizing Fabs 13H11 and MSL-109.(B) Front and back view of HCMV gHgLgO Trimer complex.(C) Electrostatic surface of HCMV gHgLgO Trimer complex (same views as in B).(D) Glycosylation-site distribution of HCMV gHgLgO Trimer complex (same views as in B).See also Figure S1 and Table S1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Overall cryo-EM map of HCMV gHgLgO Trimer complex bound to neutralizing Fabs 13H11 and MSL-109.

(D) Glycosylation-site distribution of HCMV gHgLgO Trimer complex (same views as in B). See also Figure S1 and Table S1. The overall structure of the HCMV Trimer gHgLgO adopts a boot-like architecture with approximate dimensions of 170 Å in length and 70 Å in width (Figure 1B). The three subunits interact in a linear order, where the gL subunits bridge the gH and gO subunits in the center of the complex (Figures 1A and 1B). The electrostatic surface charge is distributed asymmetrically across the gHgLgO complex with a negative charge cluster at the proximal viral membrane (VM) gH region and a positive charge cluster at the distal VM gO region of the complex (Figure 1C). Similarly, the 19 observed N-linked glycosylation sites are distributed asymmetrically along the gHgLgO complex with 5 on gH, 1 on gL, and 13 on gO. This remarkable enrichment of glycosylated residues at the distal gO region is particularly striking along the back side of complex (Figure 1D). In contrast, the front side of the trimer complex appears to lack glycosylated residues in all three subunits (Figure 1D). Such asymmetric distribution of surface charge and glycosylation will have important implications for the receptor interactions. Both Trimer and Pentamer share their gH and gL subunits but differ in the composition of the distal subunits (gO and UL128/UL130/UL131A, respectively), which mediate receptor recognition (Ciferri et al., 2015aCiferri C. Chandramouli S. Donnarumma D. Nikitin P.A. Cianfrocco M.A. Gerrein R. Feire A.L. Barnett S.W. Lilja A.E.

USA. 2015; 112: 1767-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the trimer, the four gH domains (DI–DIV) extend linearly away from the membrane proximal face, where the N-terminal region of gH (D1) co-folds with gL near the membrane distal region of the molecule (Figures 1A, 1B, and S2). Structural comparison of the gHgL subunits between the trimer structure reported herein and the crystal structure of the pentamer bound to the UL130-specific neutralizing Fab 8I21 (Chandramouli et al., 2017Chandramouli S.

Accordingly, most glycosylated residues on gH and gL point in the same directions for the trimer and pentamer with the exception of residue N641 on gH, which is found in a poorly resolved region of the trimer structure (Figure 2B).Figure 2Structural basis for the assembly of HCMV Trimer- and Pentamer-specific subunitsShow full caption(A) Superposition of the gHgL subunits of the HCMV Trimer complex (blue/pink) onto the gHgL subunits of the HCMV Pentamer complex (green, PDB: 5VOB; Chandramouli et al., 2017Chandramouli S.

See also Figures S1 and S2 and Table S1. We previously established that gO and UL128/UL130/UL131A bind to the same site on gHgL through formation of a disulfide bond with gL-C144 (Ciferri et al., 2015aCiferri C. Chandramouli S.

Rappuoli R. et al.Structural and biochemical studies of HCMV gH/gL/gO and Pentamer reveal mutually exclusive cell entry complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 1767-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but the details of how the trimer- and pentamer-specific proteins can form a very stable interaction to the same gL interface had remained mysterious. An in-depth structural comparison of the individual gH domains and the gL subunit between Trimer and Pentamer confirm the expected high degree of structural similarity. Despite this overall similarity, we observed a key difference at the most distal end of the gL subunit, which interacts with either gO in the trimer or the UL128 and UL130 subunits in the pentamer (Figures 2C–2F). gO binds as a capping crown around gL, covering ∼2,400 Å2 of its surface (Figure S2B). The interaction surface between gL and gO spans a larger area than the corresponding interfaces between gL and either Ul128 (∼1,020 Å2) or UL130 (∼910 Å2) in HCMV Pentamer (Figure S2B). A comparison between Trimer and Pentamer shows that, although the overall fold of gL is conserved, there are differences in the organization of the residues centered around the key C144 residue. Notably, in the trimer, this stretch of residues assumes a loop-like structure (Figures 2C and 2D), whereas in the pentamer, this region folds into a regular alpha-helix to coordinate UL128 binding (Figures 2E and 2F). Therefore, gL emerges as a key adaptor protein that has evolved to be able to recognize both gO or UL128/UL130 proteins through a structural switch centered around gL C144 to load the HCMV viral surface with trimer or pentamer complexes, determining cellular tropism. An important goal of HCMV research is to understand the structural basis and mechanism of action of broadly neutralizing mAbs. Notably, mAbs isolated from healthy HCMV seropositive donors that target conformation-dependent epitopes of HCMV Pentamer and Trimer have been previously reported (Falk et al., 2018Falk J.J.

https://openalex.org/W3133407392,"Abstract Protein ubiquitination is a critical regulator of cellular homeostasis. Aberrations in the addition or removal of ubiquitin can result in the development of cancer and key components of the ubiquitination machinery serve as oncogenes or tumour suppressors. An emerging target in the development of cancer therapeutics are the deubiquitinase (DUB) enzymes that remove ubiquitin from protein substrates. Whether this class of enzyme plays a role in cervical cancer has not been fully explored. By interrogating the cervical cancer data from the TCGA consortium, we noted that the DUB USP13 is amplified in ~15% of cervical cancer cases. We confirmed that USP13 expression was increased in cervical cancer cell lines, cytology samples from patients with cervical disease and in cervical cancer tissue. Depletion of USP13 inhibited cervical cancer cell proliferation. Mechanistically, USP13 bound to, deubiquitinated and stabilised Mcl-1, a pivotal member of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family. Furthermore, reduced Mcl-1 expression partially contributed to the observed proliferative defect in USP13 depleted cells. Importantly, the expression of USP13 and Mcl-1 proteins correlated in cervical cancer tissue. Finally, we demonstrated that depletion of USP13 expression or inhibition of USP13 enzymatic activity increased the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to the BH3 mimetic inhibitor ABT-263. Together, our data demonstrates that USP13 is a potential oncogene in cervical cancer that functions to stabilise the pro-survival protein Mcl-1, offering a potential therapeutic target for these cancers."

https://openalex.org/W3129929910,"Abstract The behaviour of Dictyostelium discoideum depends on nutrients 1 . When sufficient food is present these amoebae exist in a unicellular state, but upon starvation they aggregate into a multicellular organism 2,3 . This biology makes D. discoideum an ideal model for investigating how fundamental metabolism commands cell differentiation and function. Here we show that reactive oxygen species—generated as a consequence of nutrient limitation—lead to the sequestration of cysteine in the antioxidant glutathione. This sequestration limits the use of the sulfur atom of cysteine in processes that contribute to mitochondrial metabolism and cellular proliferation, such as protein translation and the activity of enzymes that contain an iron–sulfur cluster. The regulated sequestration of sulfur maintains D. discoideum in a nonproliferating state that paves the way for multicellular development. This mechanism of signalling through reactive oxygen species highlights oxygen and sulfur as simple signalling molecules that dictate cell fate in an early eukaryote, with implications for responses to nutrient fluctuations in multicellular eukaryotes."

Here, utilizing the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) mass-spectrometry-based proteomics datasets, we defined differentially expressed proteins and mRNAs associated with higher grade or higher stage, for each of seven cancer types (breast, colon, lung adenocarcinoma, clear cell renal, ovarian, uterine, and pediatric glioma), representing 794 patients. Widespread differential patterns of total proteins and phosphoproteins involved some common patterns shared between different cancer types. More proteins were associated with higher grade than higher stage. Most proteomic signatures predicted patient survival in independent transcriptomic datasets. The proteomic grade signatures, in particular, involved DNA copy number alterations. Pathways of interest were enriched within the grade-associated proteins across multiple cancer types, including pathways of altered metabolism, Warburg-like effects, and translation factors. Proteomic grade correlations identified protein kinases having functional impact in vitro in uterine endometrial cancer cells, including MAP3K2, MASTL, and TTK. The protein-level grade and stage associations for all proteins profiled-along with corresponding information on phosphorylation, pathways, mRNA expression, and copy alterations-represent a resource for identifying new potential targets.

https://openalex.org/W3130623774,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most intractable and devastating malignant tumors. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modification regulate tumor initiation and progression. However, the contribution of histone variants in PDAC is unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the histone variant H2A.Z is highly expressed in PDAC cell lines and PDAC patients and that its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis. Moreover, all three H2A.Z isoforms (H2A.Z.1, H2A.Z.2.1, and H2A.Z.2.2) are highly expressed in PDAC cell lines and PDAC patients. Knockdown of these H2A.Z isoforms in PDAC cell lines induces a senescent phenotype, cell cycle arrest in phase G2/M, increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN2A/p16, SA-β-galactosidase activity and interleukin 8 production. Transcriptome analysis of H2A.Z-depleted PDAC cells showed altered gene expression in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways and those that regulate cell cycle and DNA damage repair. Importantly, depletion of H2A.Z isoforms reduces the tumor size in a mouse xenograft model in vivo and sensitizes PDAC cells to gemcitabine. Overexpression of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2.1 more than H2A.Z.2.2 partially restores the oncogenic phenotype. Therefore, our data suggest that overexpression of H2A.Z isoforms enables cells to overcome the oncoprotective barrier associated with senescence, favoring PDAC tumor grow and chemoresistance. These results make H2A.Z a potential candidate as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W3133316142,"Improvement in sesame drought tolerance at seedling stage is important for yield stability. Genetic approaches combing with conventional breeding is the most effective way to develop drought-tolerant cultivars. In this study, three traits and their relative values, including seedling weight (SW), shoot length (SL) and root length (RL), were evaluated under control and osmotic conditions in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from cross of Zhushanbai and Jinhuangma. Significant variation and high broad sense heritability were observed for all traits except SW under stress condition in the population. With this population, a high-density linkage map with 1354 bin markers was constructed through whole genome re-sequencing (WGS) strategy. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping was performed for all the traits. A total of 34 QTLs were detected on 10 chromosomes. Among them, 13 stable QTLs were revealed in two independent experiments, eight of them were associated with traits under water stress condition. One region on chromosome 12 related to RL under osmotic condition and relative RL had the highest LOD value and explained the largest phenotypic variation among all the QTLs detected under water stress condition. These findings will provide new genetic resources for molecular improvement of drought tolerance and candidate gene identification in sesame."
https://openalex.org/W3131289310,"Maritime piracy constitutes a major threat to global shipping and international trade. We argue that fishers turn to piracy to smooth expected income losses and to deter illegal foreign fishing fleets. Previous investigations have generally focused on cross-national determinants of the incidence of piracy in territorial waters. These investigations neglect piracy in international waters and ignore its spatial dependence, whereby pirate attacks cluster in certain locations due to neighborhood and spillover effects. We conduct a geographically disaggregated analysis using geo-referenced data of piracy and its covariates between 2005 and 2014. We demonstrate that the incidence of piracy in a particular location is associated with higher catch volumes from high-bycatch and habitat-destroying fishing, even when controlling for conditions in proximate coastal areas. We find, additionally, that illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing exerts an especially pronounced effect on piracy. These findings highlight the need for anti-piracy solutions beyond enforcement to include the policing of fishing practices that are illegal or are perceived by local fishers in vulnerable coastal areas to be harmful to small-scale fishing economies."

https://openalex.org/W3132761859,"The PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein is the key oncogenic driver in fusion positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS), an aggressive soft tissue malignancy with a particularly poor prognosis. Identifying key downstream targets of PAX3-FOXO1 will provide new therapeutic opportunities for treatment of FP-RMS. Herein, we demonstrate that Forkhead Box F1 (FOXF1) transcription factor is uniquely expressed in FP-RMS and is required for FP-RMS tumorigenesis. The PAX3-FOXO1 directly binds to FOXF1 enhancers and induces FOXF1 gene expression. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated inactivation of either FOXF1 coding sequence or FOXF1 enhancers suppresses FP-RMS tumorigenesis even in the presence of PAX3-FOXO1 oncogene. Knockdown or genetic knockout of FOXF1 induces myogenic differentiation in PAX3-FOXO1-positive FP-RMS. Over-expression of FOXF1 decreases myogenic differentiation in primary human myoblasts. In FP-RMS tumor cells, FOXF1 protein binds chromatin near enhancers associated with FP-RMS gene signature. FOXF1 cooperates with PAX3-FOXO1 and E-box transcription factors MYOD1 and MYOG to regulate FP-RMS-specific gene expression. Altogether, FOXF1 functions downstream of PAX3-FOXO1 to promote FP-RMS tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3129487840,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffer from vitamin K deficiency and are at high risk of vascular calcification (VC) and premature death. We investigated the association of functional vitamin K deficiency with all-cause mortality and whether this association is modified by the presence of VC in CKD stage 5 (CKD G5). Plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix Gla-protein (dp-ucMGP), a circulating marker of functional vitamin K deficiency, and other laboratory and clinical data were determined in 493 CKD G5 patients. VC was assessed in subgroups by Agatston scoring of coronary artery calcium (CAC) and aortic valve calcium (AVC). Backward stepwise regression did not identify dp-ucMGP as an independent determinant of VC. During a median follow-up of 42 months, 93 patients died. Each one standard deviation increment in dp-ucMGP was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (sub-hazard ratio (sHR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.37) adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, body mass index, inflammation, and dialysis treatment. The association remained significant when further adjusted for CAC and AVC in sub-analyses (sHR 1.22, 1.01–1.48 and 1.27, 1.01–1.60, respectively). In conclusion, functional vitamin K deficiency associates with increased mortality risk that is independent of the presence of VC in patients with CKD G5."
https://openalex.org/W3129732315,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The majority of deaths (90%) in breast cancer patients is caused by invasion and metastasis–two features related to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Twist1 is a key transcription factor that promotes the EMT, which leads to cell migration, invasion, cancer metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Harmine is a beta-carboline alkaloid found in a variety of plants and was recently shown to be able to induce degradation of Twist Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1 (Twist1) in non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC). In this study, we show that harmine can inhibit migration and invasion of both human and mouse breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Further study shows that this inhibition is most likely achieved by inducing a proteasome-dependent Twist1 degradation. At the concentrations tested, harmine did not affect the viability of cells significantly, suggesting that its inhibition of cancer cell migration and invasion is largely independent of its cytotoxicity, but due to its ability to affect regulators of EMT such as Twist1. This result may facilitate the development of strategies that target Twist1 to treat metastatic breast cancer, as Twist1 is expressed at a high level in metastatic breast cancer cells but not in normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W3132372643,"Background Despite economic growth observed in developing countries, under-nutrition still continues to be a major health problem. Undernutrition in adolescence can disrupt normal growth and puberty development and may have long-term impact. Therefore, it is important to study the undernutrition among adolescents. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and the associated factors of stunting, thinness and the coexistence of both (stunting and thinness) among the adolescent belonging to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India. Methods The study utilized data from Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults (UDAYA) project survey, which was conducted in two Indian states Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, in 2016 by Population Council under the guidance of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Utilizing information on 20,594 adolescents aged 10–19 years (adolescent boys-5,969 and adolescent girls-14,625), the study examined three outcome variables, i.e., thinness, stunting, and co-existence of both. The study used descriptive and bivariate analysis. Furthermore, the study examined income-related inequality in stunting and thinness through concentration index. At last, the study used Wagstaff decomposition analysis to decompose the concentration index. Results The prevalence of thinness was higher among adolescent boys as compared to girls (25.8 per cent vs. 13.1 per cent). However, stunting was more prevalent among girls (25.6 per cent) than in boys (39.3 per cent). The odds of stunting were higher among late adolescents [Boys- OR:1.79; CI: 1.39, 2.30] and [Girls- OR: 2.25; CI: 1.90,2.67], uneducated adolescents [Boys- OR:2.90; CI: 1.67, 5.05] and [Girls- OR: 1.82; CI: 1.44,2.30], and poorest adolescents [Boys- OR:2.54; CI: 1.80, 3.58] and [Girls- OR: 1.79; CI: 1.38,2.32]. Similarly age, educational status, working status and wealth index were significantly associated with thinness among adolescent boys and girls. Media exposure [Boys- OR: 11.8% and Girls- 58.1%] and Wealth index [Boys: 80.1% and Girls: 66.2%] contributed significantly to the inequality in the prevalence of thinness among adolescents. Similarly, wealth index [Boys: 85.2% and Girls: 84.1%] was the only significant contributor to the inequality in the prevalence of stunting among adolescents. Conclusion The study provides an understanding that stunting and thinness is a significant public health concern among adolescents, and there is a need to tackle the issue comprehensively. By tackling the issue comprehensively, we mean that the state government of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar shall screen, assess, and monitor the nutritional status of adolescent boys and girls. The interventions shall focus towards both boys as well as girl adolescents, and particular emphasis should be given to adolescents who belonged to poor households. Also, efforts should be taken by stakeholders to increase family wealth status."
https://openalex.org/W3132494580,"Genomic instability induced by DNA damage and improper DNA damage repair is one of the main causes of malignant transformation and tumorigenesis. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most detrimental form of DNA damage, and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) mechanisms play dominant and priority roles in initiating DSB repair. A well-studied oncogene, the ubiquitin ligase Cullin 4A (CUL4A), is reported to be recruited to DSB sites in genomic DNA, but whether it regulates NHEJ mechanisms of DSB repair is unclear. Here, we discovered that the CUL4A-DTL ligase complex targeted the DNA-PKcs protein in the NHEJ repair pathway for nuclear degradation. Overexpression of either CUL4A or DTL reduced NHEJ repair efficiency and subsequently increased the accumulation of DSBs. Moreover, we demonstrated that overexpression of either CUL4A or DTL in normal cells led to genomic instability and malignant proliferation. Consistent with the in vitro findings, in human precancerous lesions, CUL4A expression gradually increased with increasing malignant tendency and was negatively correlated with DNA-PKcs and positively correlated with γ-H2AX expression. Collectively, this study provided strong evidence that the CUL4A-DTL axis increases genomic instability and enhances the subsequent malignant transformation of normal cells by inhibiting NHEJ repair. These results also suggested that CUL4A may be a prognostic marker of precancerous lesions and a potential therapeutic target in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3129490996,"The COVID-19 pandemic likely had an effect on the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election. Was it responsible for the defeat of incumbent President Donald Trump? The present study makes an initial attempt at, and provides a model for, understanding the pandemic’s influence on Trump support. The study employed a mixed experimental and correlational design and surveyed separate samples of adults (N = 1,763) in six waves beginning March 23, 2020 and ending June 1, 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to report their Trump support either before or after being reminded of the pandemic with a series of questions gauging their level of concern about it. Results revealed complex and dynamic effects that changed over time. Depending on survey wave, the pandemic seems to have lowered Trump support among Democrats, while (marginally) raising it among independents. Republicans’ reactions also changed over time; of particular note, Republicans who were more concerned about the pandemic reported higher Trump support after being reminded of the pandemic in its early stages, but this effect reversed by the time the economy began reopening (coinciding with a dip in Trump’s approval ratings). Although the correlational results in the present study did not converge neatly with the experimental results, the combined experimental and correlational approach has the potential to increase researchers’ confidence in the causal effects of salient national and international events on political attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W3131112900,"Inspired by the competition exclusion principle, this work aims at providing a computational framework to explore the theoretical feasibility of viral co-infection as a possible strategy to reduce the spread of a fatal strain in a population. We propose a stochastic-based model—called Co-Wish—to understand how competition between two viruses over a shared niche can affect the spread of each virus in infected tissue. To demonstrate the co-infection of two viruses, we first simulate the characteristics of two virus growth processes separately. Then, we examine their interactions until one can dominate the other. We use Co-Wish to explore how the model varies as the parameters of each virus growth process change when two viruses infect the host simultaneously. We will also investigate the effect of the delayed initiation of each infection. Moreover, Co-Wish not only examines the co-infection at the cell level but also includes the innate immune response during viral infection. The results highlight that the waiting times in the five stages of the viral infection of a cell in the model—namely attachment, penetration, eclipse, replication, and release—play an essential role in the competition between the two viruses. While it could prove challenging to fully understand the therapeutic potentials of viral co-infection, we discuss that our theoretical framework hints at an intriguing research direction in applying co-infection dynamics in controlling any viral outbreak’s speed."
https://openalex.org/W3132638433,"A recent flood of publications has documented serious problems in scientific reproducibility, power, and reporting of biomedical articles, yet scientists persist in their usual practices. Why? We examined a popular and important preclinical assay, the Forced Swim Test (FST) in mice used to test putative antidepressants. Whether the mice were assayed in a naïve state vs. in a model of depression or stress, and whether the mice were given test agents vs. known antidepressants regarded as positive controls, the mean effect sizes seen in the experiments were indeed extremely large (1.5–2.5 in Cohen’s d units); most of the experiments utilized 7–10 animals per group which did have adequate power to reliably detect effects of this magnitude. We propose that this may at least partially explain why investigators using the FST do not perceive intuitively that their experimental designs fall short—even though proper prospective design would require ~21–26 animals per group to detect, at a minimum, large effects (0.8 in Cohen’s d units) when the true effect of a test agent is unknown. Our data provide explicit parameters and guidance for investigators seeking to carry out prospective power estimation for the FST. More generally, altering the real-life behavior of scientists in planning their experiments may require developing educational tools that allow them to actively visualize the inter-relationships among effect size, sample size, statistical power, and replicability in a direct and intuitive manner."
https://openalex.org/W3129764482,"We introduce a novel and simple method for assessing audiences’ emotional responses to audiovisuals (e.g. films). Viewers ( N = 21) watched movies and TV commercials from different genres while wearing photoplethysmography (PPG) optic sensors on their wrists. Heart rate variability (HRV) synchrony was observed among the audience. Based on this between-subject synchrony measure, we identified emotionally arousing segments from the materials. New participants ( N = 24; N = 16) were then invited to watch these identified segments along with some randomly selected segments as control; they reported that the former was more engaging (effect size w = .67; w = .5). This finding was confirmed in an online study with a larger cohort ( N = 300 ) . While some specific effects varied depending on movie genre or gender, HRV-based editing generally performed better than the control. These findings suggest that HRV synchrony can be used as a new tool for audience psychology, and potentially also for automatically creating short trailers out of movies in a principled manner while taking into account the human perspective."
https://openalex.org/W3130516461,"Background In October 2016, a senior high school student was diagnosed with sputum-smear positive [SS(+)] pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). We conducted an investigation of an outbreak in the school, including among students and teachers diagnosed with latent TB, who we followed until July 2019. Methods We defined latent TB infection (LTBI) as a tuberculin skin test (TST) induration of 15mm or larger; probable TB as a chest radiograph indicative of TB plus productive cough/hemoptysis for at least 2 weeks, or TST induration of 15mm or larger; and confirmed TB as two or more positive sputum smears or one positive sputum smear plus a chest radiograph indicative of TB or culture positive with M . tuberculosis . We conducted mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit–variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing based on 24 loci in the isolates. Results Between October 2016 and July 2019, we identified 52 cases, including nine probable, six confirmed, and 37 LTBI cases. The index case-student had attended school continuously despite having TB symptoms for almost three months before being diagnosed with TB. We obtained three isolates from classmates of the index case in 2016; all had identical MIRU-VNTR alleles with the index case. The LTBI rate was lower among students (7.41%, 30/405) than among teachers (26.92%, 7/26) (rate ratio [RR] = 0.28, 95% confidential interval [CI]: 0.13–0.57). Among the 17 students who had latent TB and refused prophylaxis in October 2016, 23.53% (4/17) became probable/confirmed cases by July 2019. None of the six teachers who also refused prophylaxis became probable or confirmed cases. Of the 176 students who were TST(-) in October 2016, 1.70% (3/176) became probable/confirmed cases, and among the 20 teachers who were TST(-), 1 became a probable case. Conclusions Delayed diagnosis of TB in the index patient may have contributed to the start of this outbreak; lack of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis facilitated spread of the outbreak. Post-exposure prophylaxis is strongly recommended for all TST-positive students; TST-negative students exposed to an SS(+) case should be followed up regularly so that prophylaxis can be started if LTBI is detected."
https://openalex.org/W3130918829,"Mass trapping of gravid females represents one promising strategy for the development of sustainable tools against Aedes aegypti . However, this technique requires the development of effective odorant lures that can compete with natural breeding sites. The presence of conspecific larvae has been shown to stimulate oviposition. Hence, we evaluated the role of four major molecules previously identified from Ae . aegypti larvae (isovaleric, myristoleic, myristic [i.e. tetradecanoic], and pentadecanoic acids) on the oviposition of conspecific females, as well as their olfactory perception to evaluate their range of detection. Using flight cage assays, the preference of gravid females to oviposit in water that previously contained larvae (LHW) or containing the four larval compounds was evaluated. Then, compounds and doses inducing the highest stimulation were challenged for their efficacy against LHW. Only isovaleric acid elicited antennal response, suggesting that the other compounds may act as taste cues. Pentadecanoic acid induced significant oviposition stimulation, especially when dosed at 10 ppm. Myristoleic acid and isovaleric acid deterred oviposition at 10 and 100 ppm, while no effect on oviposition was observed with myristic acid irrespectively of the dose tested. When the four compounds were pooled to mimic larvae’s chemical signature, they favored oviposition at 1 ppm but negatively affected egg-laying at higher concentrations. When properly dosed, pentadecanoic acid and the blend of compounds may be promising lures for ovitraps as they could compete with LHW. Due to their low volatility, their effect should be further evaluated under field conditions, in addition with long-range attractants for developing effective tools against gravid females."
https://openalex.org/W3130957322,"Abstract Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is a ubiquitin ligase (E3) that becomes activated upon Tyr371-phosphorylation and targets receptor protein tyrosine kinases for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Deregulation of CBL and its E3 activity is observed in myeloproliferative neoplasms and other cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer. Here, we explore the oncogenic mechanism of E3-inactive CBL mutants identified in myeloproliferative neoplasms. We show that these mutants bind strongly to CIN85 under normal growth conditions and alter the CBL interactome. Lack of E3 activity deregulates CIN85 endosomal trafficking, leading to an altered transcriptome that amplifies signaling events to promote oncogenesis. Disruption of CBL mutant interactions with EGFR or CIN85 reduces oncogenic transformation. Given the importance of the CBL–CIN85 interaction in breast cancers, we examined the expression levels of CIN85, CBL, and the status of Tyr371-phosphorylated CBL (pCBL) in human breast cancer tissue microarrays. Interestingly, pCBL shows an inverse correlation with both CIN85 and CBL, suggesting that high expression of inactivated CBL could coordinate with CIN85 for breast cancer progression. Inhibition of the CBL–CIN85 interaction with a proline-rich peptide of CBL that binds CIN85 reduced the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. Together, these results provide a rationale for exploring the potential of targeting the EGFR–CBL–CIN85 axis in CBL-inactivated mutant cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3131299949,"Mobile gambling differs from land-based and traditional forms of gambling in that the opportunity to place bets and engage with casinos is constantly present and easily accessible. Instead of going to a physical bookmaker or casino, mobile gambling is done quickly and swiftly, anytime, anywhere, with a few taps on a mobile device. Previous studies reveal mobile gambling has managed to reach new audiences especially amongst younger people. Gambling harms can have severe adverse effects on individuals, families and society. However, for a subgroup of highly involved individuals, gambling can be considered a harmonious passion that permits frequent gambling without elevating individual’s risks of experience problem gambling manifestations. Combining the Uses and Gratifications (U&amp;G) and Dualistic Model of Passion (DMP) frameworks, the present study aims to determine if and how the different gratifications sought from mobile gambling are susceptible to explaining non-problematic versus problematic patterns in highly involved gamblers. Data were collected over two waves from a global sample of mobile gamblers (N = 327). Results emphasize that the motivational underpinnings of mobile gambling (as measured by the U&amp;G) differ in obsessive versus harmonious passion. Obsessive passion is associated with poor mood and problematic gambling. In contrast, harmonious passion for mobile gambling is associated with positive mood but is unrelated to problematic gambling. Based on these findings, and given that problematic gambling is an internationally relevant public health issue (the prevalence of problem gambling is estimated to range from 0.1% to 5.8% in different countries), we suggest interventions focusing on specific uses and gratifications associated with an obsessive passion for mobile gambling may be effective in reducing problematic usage patterns."

Floral pollen is also important but is less recognized due to a lack of investigation. This study aims to determine the morphological characteristics and nutritional and phytochemical properties of floral maize pollen. Fresh pollen grains harvested from a farm of maize plants are yellow in colour and spheroid in shape. They change to amber and indented prismatic solid shapes when dehydrated. The main composition of floral maize pollen is carbohydrates (44.30±3.73%), followed by moisture (23.38±5.73%), crude proteins (17.16±3.13%), crude fibres (9.56±0.92%), and ash (4.98±0.11%), while the lowest content is observed for crude fats (0.62±0.06%). The predominant mineral is potassium (768.50±11.40 mg 100 g -1 ), followed by sodium (695.10±9.70 mg 100 g -1 ), calcium (147.20±12.60 mg 100 g -1 ), and magnesium (97.30±2.9 mg 100 g -1 ). The microelements (with average values) consist of iron (49.50±3.30 mg 100 g -1 ) and zinc (30.00±3.70 mg 100 g -1 ). Excellent phytochemical properties add value to floral maize pollen. Maize pollen contains a high total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) of 783.02 mg GAE 100 g -1 and 1706.83 mg QE 100 g -1 , respectively, and possesses strong antioxidant activity of 10.54 mg mL -1 .

For this purpose, an experiment was carried out on 12 clinically healthy sows of the Great White Poland breed, which were divided randomly into two groups the control and the HMB group. All animals were kept under standard conditions and received the same feed for pregnant females. In contrast, females from the HMB group between 70 and 90 days were supplemented with 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyle in the amount of 0.2g/kg b.w/day. Immediately after birth, the piglets were also divided into groups based on: sex, and presence or lack HMB supplementation, and subsequently were euthanized and humerus bones from all piglets were collected. Mother’s HMB supplementation during pregnancy affected the multiple index of their offspring. The higher humerus mass and length was observed with the greater effect in males. Maternal supplementation also influenced on the geometrical and mechanical properties of the humerus as in the case of mass, this effect was higher in males. Also, the collagen structure of the compacted and trabecular bone changed under the HMB addition. Maternal supplementation also affected the expression of selected proteins in growth cartilage and trabecular bone. The obtained results show that the administration to the mother during pregnancy by the HMB significantly affects the development of the humerus in many ways. The obtained results also confirm the utility of such experiments in understanding of the importance of the pregnancy diet as an develop and adaptable factor of offspring organisms and are the base for further research in that area as well as in the protein markers expression area."
https://openalex.org/W3133167364,"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 although mechanisms underlying AKI are yet unclear. There may be a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the kidney; however, there is currently no data linking SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) to AKI. We explored the association of SARS-CoV-2 VL at admission to AKI in a large diverse cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods and findings We included patients hospitalized between March 13 th and May 19 th , 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 in a large academic healthcare system in New York City (N = 1,049) with available VL at admission quantified by real-time RT-PCR. We extracted clinical and outcome data from our institutional electronic health records (EHRs). AKI was defined by KDIGO guidelines. We fit a Fine-Gray competing risks model (with death as a competing risk) using demographics, comorbidities, admission severity scores, and log 10 transformed VL as covariates and generated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). VL was associated with an increased risk of AKI (aHR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.08, p = 0.02) with a 4% increased hazard for each log 10 VL change. Patients with a viral load in the top 50 th percentile had an increased adjusted hazard of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.02–1.58, p = 0.03) for AKI as compared to those in the bottom 50 th percentile. Conclusions VL is weakly but significantly associated with in-hospital AKI after adjusting for confounders. This may indicate the role of VL in COVID-19 associated AKI. This data may inform future studies to discover the mechanistic basis of COVID-19 associated AKI."
https://openalex.org/W3130081704,"Background Community-based data on the prevalence of clinical signs of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) and the mortality associated with them are scarce. The aim was to examine the prevalence for each sign of infection and mortality associated with infants in the first two months of life, using community surveillance through community health workers (CHW). Methods We used population-based surveillance data of infants up to two months of age from the African Neonatal Sepsis Trial (AFRINEST). In this study, CHWs visited infants up to 10 times during the first two months of life at five sites in three sub-Saharan African countries. CHW assessed the infant for signs of infection (local or systemic) and referred infants who presented with any sign of infection to a health facility. We used a longitudinal analysis to calculate the risk of death associated with the presence of a sign of infection at the time of the visit until the subsequent visit. Results During the first two months of their life, CHWs visited 84,759 live-born infants at least twice. In 11,089 infants (13.1%), one or more signs of infection were identified, of which 237 (2.1%) died. A sign of infection was detected at 2.1% of total visits. In 52% of visits, infants had one or more sign of systemic infection, while 25% had fast breathing in 7–59 days period and 23% had a local infection. All signs of infection, including multiple signs, were more frequently seen in the first week of life. The risk of mortality was very low (0.2%) for local infections and fast breathing in 7–59 days old, it was low for fast breathing 0–6 days old (0.6%), high body temperature (0.7%) and severe chest indrawing (1.0%), moderate for low body temperature (4.9%) and stopped feeding well/not able to feed at all (5.0%) and high for movement only when stimulated or no movement at all (10%) and multiple signs of systemic infection (15.5%). The risk of death associated with most clinical signs was higher (1.5 to 9 times) in the first week of life than at later age, except for low body temperature (4 times lower) as well as high body temperature (2 times lower). Conclusion Signs of infections are common in the first two months of life. The mortality risk differs with clinical signs and can be grouped as very low (local infections, fast breathing 7–59 days), low (fever, severe chest indrawing and fast breathing 0–6 days), moderate (low body temperature and stopped feeding well/not able to feed at all) and high (for movements only on stimulation or no movements at all and multiple signs of infection). New treatment strategies that consider differential mortality risk could be developed and evaluated based on these findings.

https://openalex.org/W3133238649,"Alterations in the substantia nigra are strongly associated with Parkinson’s disease. However, due to low contrast and partial volume effects present in typical MRI images, the substantia nigra is not of sufficient size to obtain a reliable segmentation for region-of-interest based analysis. To combat this problem, the approach proposed here offers a method to investigate and reveal changes in quantitative MRI parameters in the vicinity of substantia nigra without any a priori delineation. This approach uses an alternative method of statistical, voxel-based analysis of quantitative maps and was tested on 18 patients and 15 healthy controls using a well-established, quantitative free water mapping protocol. It was possible to reveal the topology and the location of pathological changes in the substantia nigra and its vicinity. Moreover, a decrease in free water content, T 1 and T 2 * in the vicinity of substantia nigra was indicated in the Parkinson’s disease patients compared to the healthy controls. These findings reflect a disruption of grey matter and iron accumulation, which is known to lead to neurodegeneration. Consequently, the proposed method demonstrates an increased sensitivity for the detection of pathological changes—even in small regions—and can facilitate disease monitoring via quantitative MR parameters."

We compared the glucose measurements obtained by the CGM device with blood glucose (BG) concentrations. Neonatal foals (0–2 weeks of age) and adult horses (&gt; 1 year old) admitted in the period of March-May 2016 with clinical and laboratory parameters compatible with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) were included. Glucose concentration was monitored every 4 hours on blood samples with a point-of-care (POC) glucometer and with a blood gas analyzer. A CGM system was also placed on six adults and four foals but recordings were successfully obtained only in four adults and one foal. Glucose concentrations corresponded fairly well between BG and CGM, however, there appeared to be a lag time for interstitial glucose levels. Fluctuations of glucose in the interstitial fluid did not always follow the same trend as BG. CGM identified peaks and drops that would have been missed with conventional glucose monitoring. The use of CGM system is feasible in ill horses and may provide clinically relevant information on glucose levels, but there are several challenges that need to be resolved for the system to gain more widespread usability."
https://openalex.org/W3130873405,"Deinococcus radiodurans harbors a multipartite ploid genome system consisting of two chromosomes and two plasmids present in multiple copies. How these discrete genome elements are maintained and inherited is not well understood. PprA, a pleiotropic protein involved in radioresistance, has been characterized for its roles in DNA repair, genome segregation, and cell division in this bacterium. Here, we show that PprA regulates ploidy of chromosome I and II and inhibits the activity of drDnaA, the initiator protein in D. radiodurans. We found that pprA deletion resulted in an increased genomic content and ploidy of both the chromosomal elements. Expression of PprA in trans rescued the phenotypes of the pprA mutant. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying these phenotypes, we characterized drDnaA and drDnaB. As expected for an initiator protein, recombinant drDnaA showed sequence-specific interactions with the putative oriC sequence in chromosome I (oriCI). Both drDnaA and drDnaB showed ATPase activity, also typical of initiator proteins, but only drDnaB exhibited 5′→3′ dsDNA helicase activity in vitro. drDnaA and drDnaB showed homotypic and heterotypic interactions with each other, which were perturbed by PprA. Interestingly, PprA has inhibited the ATPase activity of drDnaA but showed no effect on the activity of drDnaB. Regulation of chromosome copy number and inhibition of the initiator protein functions by PprA strongly suggest that it plays a role as a checkpoint regulator of the DNA replication initiation in D. radiodurans perhaps through its interaction with the replication initiation machinery.

The origin of replication in bacterial chromosome (oriC) is a discrete locus that contains AT-rich conserved DNA motifs and a varying number of 9 mer repeats of nonpalindromic sequences called DnaA boxes. These boxes are recognized by a replication initiator protein named DnaA, followed by the assembly of replication initiation complex at oriC (1Messer W. The bacterial replication initiator DnaA.

DNA replication initiation: Mechanisms and regulation in bacteria.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Mechanisms underlying replication initiation have been characterized in large number of bacteria harboring limited copies of single circular chromosome as inheritable genetic material (3Zakrzewska-Czerwińska J.

Subsequently, a hexameric complex of replicative helicase DnaB and its loader DnaC (DnaB6-DnaC6) is recruited to the unwound region in oriC resulting in the formation of the prepriming complex (5Skarstad K.

This provides the site for binding of primase and activation of various events required for the progression of the replication complex that includes DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. DnaB hexameric ring translocates bidirectionally to unwind the parental duplex DNA while the 3′ end of the primer is extended by DNA polymerase complex (7McHenry C.S.

In E. coli, the initiation of DNA replication at oriC site is tightly regulated and the next round of oriC-mediated DNA replication must have to wait till the oriC of newly replicated daughter chromosomes is fully methylated. Therefore, under normal growth conditions, the number of copies of the primary chromosome per cell is expected to be less than 2 (5Skarstad K. Katayama T. Regulating DNA replication in bacteria.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5a012922Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recently, the bacteria with multiple copies of the multipartite genome system have been reported. Notably, most of them are either parasites to some forms of life or exhibit super tolerance to abiotic stresses (9Misra H.S. Maurya G.K. Kota S. Charaka V.K. Maintenance of multipartite genome system and its functional significance in bacteria.J. Genet. 2018; 97: 1013-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The ploidy of chromosomes in these bacteria allowed us to revisit the mechanism of oriC regulation as known in bacteria containing less than two copies of circular chromosome per cell. Mechanisms underlying the regulation of oriC function in multipartite genome harboring bacteria have not been studied in detail. In the case of Vibrio cholerae, which harbors two chromosomes, namely chromosome I (Chr I) and chromosome II (Chr II), the Chr I replicates similar to the E. coli chromosome while Chr II follows a replication mechanism that is akin to low copy number P1 and F plasmids (10Egan E.S.

It harbors a multipartite genome system comprised of two chromosomes (Chr I (2,648,638 bp) and Chr II (412,348 bp)) and a megaplasmid (177,466 bp) and a plasmid (45,704 bp) (20White O. Eisen J.A.

Chr I of D. radiodurans encodes the putative DnaA (DR_0002) and DnaB (DR_0549) (hereafter named drDnaA and drDnaB, respectively) while chromosome II encodes PprA (DR_A0346), which has been characterized for various functions (22Narumi I.

Interaction of double-stranded DNA with polymerized PprA protein from Deinococcus radiodurans.Protein Sci. 2014; 23: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Recently, the extended structure of PprA has been reported where a possibility of it acting as a protein scaffold has been suggested (26Adachi M. Shimizu R. Shibazaki C. Satoh K. Fujiwara S. Arai S.

Here, for the first time, we report the functional characterization of chromosome replication initiation proteins drDnaA and drDnaB in D. radiodurans and demonstrate that PprA plays an important role in regulation of DNA replication. The pprA mutant showed an increased copy number of chromosome I (ChrI) and chromosome II (ChrII), which was complemented by the in trans expression of the wild-type PprA. Interestingly, there was no effect of PprA over expression on copy number of the different genome elements in the wild-type cells. drDnaA was characterized as a sequence-specific origin of replication (oriCI) binding protein and an oriCI responsive ATPase. drDnaB was found to be an ATP-dependent 5′→3′ dsDNA helicase and showed higher affinity for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) than double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Interestingly, PprA interacted with drDnaA at a relatively higher affinity than drDnaB and inhibited both homotypic and heterotypic interactions of these proteins. Further, PprA downregulated the ATPase activity of drDnaA but showed no effect on ATPase and helicase activities of drDnaB. These results suggest that drDnaA and drDnaB carry out the necessary functions required for initiation of replication at oriCI in D. radiodurans. Furthermore, the interference imposed by PprA in the physicochemical properties of these replication proteins as well as an increase in the copy numbers of both primary and secondary chromosomes in its absence together suggested the involvement of PprA in regulation of chromosomal replication in this bacterium. Earlier, the regulatory role of PprA in cell division and genome maintenance has been demonstrated (23Kota S. Charaka V.K. Ringgaard S. Waldor M.K. Misra H.S.

In this study, the DNA content and the copy number of genome elements in pprA deletion mutant were compared with the wild-type D. radiodurans. The total DNA content in mutant cells (∼8.41 ± 1.05 fg per cell) was found to be approximately threefold higher than wild-type cells (∼3.05 ± 0.47 fg per cell) (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the DAPI fluorescence in ΔpprA mutant was approximately twofold higher than that of wild type (Fig. 1B). The cell scan analysis of DAPI stained cells showed that ∼80% of ΔpprA cells have approximately twofold higher DAPI fluorescence as compared with wild-type cells grown identically (Fig. 1C). When we checked the copy number of each replicon per cell, we found that the average copy number of Chr I and Chr II was ∼2.5- to 3-fold higher in ΔpprA mutant as compared with the wild type. For instance, the average copy number of Chr I was ∼8 per cell in wild type while it was ∼18 per cell in the ΔpprA mutant. The average copy number of Chr II also increased from ∼7 in wild type to ∼17 per cell in the ΔpprA mutant (Fig. 1D). Further we checked the effect of in trans expression of PprA on the copy number of these genome elements in wild type and ΔpprA mutant. We observed nearly no effect of PprA over expression in wild type, whereas the ΔpprA mutant expressing PprA in trans could restore the wild-type copies of the genome element (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the copy number of megaplasmid and small plasmid did not change under any of these conditions. These results indicated a possible role of PprA in the maintenance of the chromosome copy number possibly by regulating the replication of DNA in D. radiodurans. To obtain the mechanistic insights into the regulatory role of PprA in DNA replication, the physical and functional interaction of PprA with drDnaA or drDnaB proteins was monitored using bacterial two-hybrid system. For this, T18-tagged PprA and T25-tagged drDnaA or drDnaB were coexpressed in E. coli BTH101 (cyaA−). Interaction of two target proteins tagged with T18 and T25 domains of CyaA would reconstitute the active CyaA resulting in induction of transcription from β-galactosidase gene in BTH101. Expression of β-galactosidase as an indication of protein–protein interaction was monitored using spot test. PprA showed interaction with both drDnaA and drDnaB as indicated by a blue color in the spot test (Fig. 2A). The interaction of PprA with these proteins was further checked using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using purified recombinant drDnaA or drDnaB (Fig. S1). Results showed a concentration-dependent increase in the SPR signals for both drDnaA and drDnaB (Fig. 2, B and C). The dissociation constant (Kd) for drDnaA was 5.41 × 10−7 ± 1.8 X 10−8 [M] while it was 9.71 × 10−7 ± 1.1 × 10−8 [M] for drDnaB indicating that PprA interacts with drDnaA with approximately twofold higher affinity than with drDnaB. Interaction of C-terminal deletion (CTD) mutant of drDnaA (DnaAΔCt) with PprA was tested in surrogate E. coli using co-immunoprecipitation. Results showed that the deletion of CTD did not affect drDnaA interaction with PprA (Fig. 2D) suggesting that drDnaA might interact with PprA through its N-terminal domain and/or the middle region of the protein. In vivo interaction of PprA with drDnaA and dDnaB was tested using co-immunoprecipitation assays with the cellular protein extracts from D. radiodurans cells transformed with T18-tagged drDnaA or drDnaB expressing plasmid. Endogenous PprA was precipitated using anti-PprA antibodies and the presence of T18-tagged drDnaA/drDnaB was probed using immunoblotting with T18 antibodies. Consistent with the above results, both drDnaA and drDnaB had co-immunoprecipitated with PprA in vivo (Fig. 2E). These results together suggested that PprA interacts with both drDnaA and drDnaB of D. radiodurans. The putative origin of replication of chromosome I (oriCI) in D. radiodurans R1, spanning 1183 to 1903 bp upstream of drdnaA gene (DR_0002), was predicted using the DOriC database (DoriC accession number – ORI10010007) (29Luo H. Gao F. DoriC 10.0: An updated database of replication origins in prokaryotic genomes including chromosomes and plasmids.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 47: D74-D77Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis using WebLogo online tool revealed the presence of consensus sequences of 13 copies of 9-mer DnaA-boxes (30Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. WebLogo: A sequence logo generator.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (7179) Google Scholar) between 1273 and 1772 bp (∼500 bp) upstream of the drdnaA gene. A 46.2% GC content of oriCI indicated an AT-rich sequence, typical of canonical oriC sequences. The structure of oriCI was found to be different as compared with the E. coli oriC. It is comparatively longer than the E. coli oriC and contains only eight out of 13 perfect E. coli like DnaA boxes (TTATCCACA). Five out of 13 DnaA boxes were imperfect with single nucleotide difference from the E. coli type boxes and were similar to other bacteria such as Cyanothece 51142, Thermus thermophilus, and Bacillus subtilis (Fig. S2) (31Huang H. Song C.C. Yang Z.L. Dong Y. Hu Y.Z. Gao F. Identification of the replication origins from cyanothece ATCC 51142 and their interactions with the DnaA protein: From in silico to in vitro studies.Front.

Regulation of initiation of the chromosomal replication by DnaA-boxes in the origin region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome.EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2911-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A web logo of these DnaA boxes was created yielding a consensus sequence of T(A/G)TA(T)TCCACA. These DnaA boxes are distributed randomly on both sense (four DnaA boxes) and antisense (nine DnaA boxes) strands of chromosome I. This suggested that oriCI in chromosome I of D. radiodurans is largely similar to oriC of E.coli with some deviations. Whether these changes have any functional significance, in the context of regulation of replication initiation, needs to be explored. Binding of recombinant drDnaA (Fig. S1A) to [32P] end labeled oriCI containing 13 repeats of DnaA-boxes was checked by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). The recombinant drDnaA showed sequence-specific interaction with oriCI as the binding did not change even in the presence of 50-fold excess of cold nonspecific DNA (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, the binding affinity of drDnaA for oriCI (Kd = 1.68 ± 0.23 μM) was increased by approximately eightfold in presence of ATP (Kd = 0.243 ± 0.02 μM) (Fig. 3, C and D). Further, binding of [32P] end labeled nonspecific DNA with increasing concentrations of drDnaA was displaced by addition of higher molar concentration of cold oriCI DNA confirming the sequence-specific interaction of drDnaA to oriCI (Fig. 3E). In addition, the binding affinity of drDnaA for oriCI decreased upon reducing the number of DnaA boxes (Fig. S3) in the presence of ATP (Table 1). The effect of histidine tag on DNA-binding activity drDnaA was ruled out as both (his)6 tagged and non-(his)6 tagged drDNA showed nearly similar Kd for dsDNA (Fig. S4). Similar to E. coli DnaA, which shares 44.4% identity and 72% similarity with drDnaA (data not shown), drDnaA showed specific binding even for the oriCI sequence with only a single DnaA box. However, the affinity of drDnaA for a perfect DnaA box (TTATCCACA) was approximately twofold higher (Kd = 2.88 ± 0.28 μM) than the affinity (Kd = 4.21 ± 0.15 μM or 4.36 ± 0.18 μM) for imperfect DnaA boxes (TTTTCCACA or GTATCCACA) (Table 1). These results suggested that drDnaA binds to oriCI in a sequence-specific manner and this interaction is stimulated by ATP.Table 1Dissociation constant (Kd) of drDnaA with oriCI and its repeat variants with the different number of DnaA boxes was measured in the presence and absence of ATPNumber of repeatsLength (bp)ATPDissociation constant (Kd)Mean ± SD (μM)Full length (13 repeats)500 bp−1.78 ± 0.23Full length (13 repeats)500 bp+0.243 ± 0.02111 Repeats261 bp+0.241 ± 0.017 Repeats164 bp+0.373 ± 0.013 Repeats37 bp+1.08 ± 0.121 Repeat (TTATCCACA)16 bp+2.88 ± 0.281 (TTTTCCACA) nonperfect repeat16 bp+4.21 ± 0.151 (GTATCCACA) nonperfect repeat16 bp+4.36 ± 0.18Recombinant purified drDnaA was incubated with radiolabeled repeat variants of linear oriCI in the presence (+) and absence (−) of ATP and EMSA was carried out, and autoradiograms were developed as shown in Figure 4.

The Kd for the curve fitting of individual plots was determined using GraphPad Prism6 software. Since, drDnaA showed a relatively higher affinity for oriCI in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3C), ATP hydrolysis by drDnaA in the presence and absence of oriCI was tested. Results showed that drDnaA hydrolyzes [32P] αATP into [32P] αADP (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the ATP hydrolysis by drDnaA is stimulated in the presence of oriCI (Fig. 4, B and C) but not in the presence of nonspecific dsDNA (Fig. S5). The helix-turn-helix motif in domain IV at the C terminal of DnaA is known to confer sequence specificity for DnaA–oriC interaction in many bacteria (34Roth A. Messer W.

Therefore, the binding of drDnaA having a deleted C terminal (domain IV) (DnaAΔCt) (Fig. 5A) with oriCI was checked in the presence and absence of ATP. DnaAΔCt failed to bind oriCI (Fig. 5B) and the ATPase activity of DnaAΔCt (Fig. 5C) did not change in the presence of oriCI (Fig. 5, D and E). Further, the effect of CTD deletion on rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated using both drDnaA and DnaAΔCt proteins at 30 nM [32P] αATP. The rate of ATP hydrolysis in drDnaA (0.76 ± 0.04 nM/min) was found to be nearly similar to DnaAΔCt (0.81 ± 0.05 nM/min). These results suggested that the C-terminal domain IV of drDnaA is essential for its binding to oriCI and thus for oriCI-dependent stimulation of ATPase function but seems to have no role in the ATPase activity of drDnaA per se.Figure 5Role of C-terminal putative helix-turn-helix motifs containing domain in drDnaA function. The 99 amino acids of drDnaA were removed from its C terminal and resulting DnaAΔCt derivative was generated (A). An increasing concentration of recombinant protein was incubated with radiolabeled linear oriCI (oriI) DNA as described in Figure 4A. Products were analyzed on native PAGE and autoradiogram was developed (B). Similarly, 2 μM concentration of DnaAΔCt was incubated for different time points with [32P]-αATP in the absence (C) and presence (D) of linear oriCI (oriI) DNA. Products were separated on TLC and analyzed as described in Figure 4. The percentage of ADP/ATP ratios was plotted as a function of time (E). Results were analyzed using Student’s t-test and significant difference in data sets with p values of 0.05 or less is shown as (∗).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of recombinant drDnaB to the oriCI was checked by EMSA. drDnaB showed nonspecific binding to oriCI as chase with nonspecific dsDNA significantly competed out oriCI bound to drDnaB. The affinity of drDnaB for oriCI (Kd = 8.89 ± 0.92 μM) did not change in the presence of ATP (Kd = 8.23 ± 0.41 μM). Interestingly, drDnaB showed approximately threefold higher affinity to ssDNA substrate (Kd = 3.11 ± 0.11 μM) as compared with dsDNA (oriCI) (Kd = 8.89 ± 0.92 μM). Further, binding of drDnaB to ssDNA increased by nearly twofold in the presence of ATP (Kd = 1.42 ± 0.05 μM) (Fig. 6) and approximately threefold in the presence of ATPγS (1.02 ± 0.06 μM) (Fig. S6). Addition of ATP increased drDnaB affinity for ssDNA but not for dsDNA. These results suggested that drDnaB preferentially binds to ssDNA over dsDNA both in the presence and absence of ATP. Similar to drDnaA, drDnaB could hydrolyze [32P]-αATP to [32P]-αADP (Fig. 7A). The stimulatory effect of ssDNA on ATP hydrolysis was observed albeit at a very low level and only at the lower ATP to protein ratios (Fig. 7, B and C). Similar observations were reported earlier for other DnaB homologs (40Biswas E.E. Barnes M.H. Moir D.T. Biswas S.B.

These results suggested that drDnaB is an ssDNA-binding ATPase and its binding to ssDNA is affected by ATP hydrolysis in vitro.Figure 7ATPase activity of purified recombinant drDnaB.

https://openalex.org/W3132178407,"Background Globally, the possession of medicines stored at home is increasing. However, little is known about the determinants of possessing medicines, their usage according to clinical purpose, which we term ‘correct drug match’, and the role of health insurance. Methods This study uses data from a 2013 survey evaluating a health insurance program in Kwara State, Nigeria, which upgraded health facilities and subsidized insurance premiums. The final dataset includes 1,090 households and 4,641 individuals. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regressions were conducted at both the individual level and at the level of the medicines kept in respondents’ homes to understand the determinants of medicine possession and correct drug match, respectively, and to investigate the effect of health insurance on both. Results A total of 9,266 medicines were classified with 61.2% correct match according to self-reported use, 11.9% incorrect match and 26.9% indeterminate. Most medicines (73.0%) were obtained from patent proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs). At 36.6%, analgesics were the most common medicine held at home, while anti-malarial use had the highest correct match at 96.1%. Antihistamines, vitamins and minerals, expectorants, and antibiotics were most likely to have an incorrect match at respectively 35.8%, 33.6%, 31.9%, and 26.6%. Medicines were less likely to have a correct match when found with the uneducated and obtained from public facilities. Enrolment in the insurance program increased correct matches for specific medicines, notably antihypertensives and antibiotics (odds ratio: 25.15 and 3.60, respectively). Conclusion Since PPMVs serve as both the most popular and better channel compared to the public sector to obtain medicines, we recommend that policymakers strengthen their focus on these vendors to educate communities on medicine types and their correct use. Health insurance programs that provide affordable access to improved-quality health facilities represent another important avenue for reducing the burden of incorrect drug use. This appears increasingly important in view of the global rise in antimicrobial resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3132557398,"Introduction Bedtime routines are one of the most common family activities. They affect children’ wellbeing, development and health. Despite their importance, there is limited evidence and agreement on what constitutes an optimal bedtime routine. This study aims to reach expert consensus on a definition of optimal bedtime routines and to propose a measurement for bedtime routines. Method Four-step DELPHI process completed between February and March 2020 with 59 experts from different scientific, health and social care backgrounds. The DELPHI process started with an expert discussion group and then continued with 3 formal DELPHI rounds during which different elements of the definition and measurement of bedtime routines were iteratively refined. The proposed measurement of bedtime routines was then validated against existing data following the end of the DELPHI process. Results At the end of the four round DELPHI process and with a consistent 70% agreement level, a holistic definition of bedtime routines for families with young children between the ages of 2 and 8 years was achieved. Additionally, two approaches for measuring bedtime routines, one static (one-off) and one dynamic (over a 7-night period) are proposed following the end of the DELPHI process. A Bland-Altman difference plot was also calculated and visually examined showing agreement between the measurements that could allow them to be used interchangeably. Discussion Both the definition and the proposed measurements of bedtime routines are an important, initial step towards capturing a behavioural determinant of important health and developmental outcomes in children."
https://openalex.org/W3129550214,"Objective This study was aimed to evaluate the performance of quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) in predicting the emergency department (ED) mortality of non-trauma patients and to expand the application scope of qSOFA score. Methods A single, retrospective review of non-trauma patients was conducted in ED between November 1, 2016 and November 1, 2019. The qSOFA score was obtained from vital signs and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. The outcome was ED mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the association between the qSOFA score and ED mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, the best cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity were performed to ascertain the predictive value of the qSOFA score. Results 228(1.96%) of the 11621 patients were died. The qSOFA score was statistically higher in the non-survival group (P&lt;0.001). The qSOFA score 0 subgroup was used as reference baseline, after adjusting for gender and age, adjusted OR of 1, 2 and 3 subgroups were 4.77 (95%CI 3.40 to 6.70), 18.17 (95%CI 12.49 to 26.44) and 23.63 (95%CI 9.54 to 58.52). All these three subgroups show significantly higher ED mortality compared to qSOFA 0 subgroup (P&lt;0.001). AUROC of qSOFA score was 0.76 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.79). The best cutoff value was 0, sensitivity was 77.63% (95%CI 71.7% to 82.9%), and specificity was 67.2% (95%CI 66.3% to 68.1%). Conclusion The qSOFA score was associated with ED mortality in non-trauma patients and showed good prognostic performance. It can be used as a general tool to evaluate non-trauma patients in ED. This is just a retrospective cohort study, a prospective or a randomized study will be required."
