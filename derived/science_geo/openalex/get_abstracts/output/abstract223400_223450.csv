ACE2 has been implicated in the regulation of heart function and also as a functional receptor for the coronavirus that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To gain further insights into this enzyme, the first crystal structures of the native and inhibitor-bound forms of the ACE2 extracellular domains were solved to 2.2- and 3.0-Å resolution, respectively. Comparison of these structures revealed a large inhibitor-dependent hinge-bending movement of one catalytic subdomain relative to the other (∼16°) that brings important residues into position for catalysis. The potent inhibitor MLN-4760 ((S,S)-2-{1-carboxy-2-[3-(3,5-dichlorobenzyl)-3H-imidazol4-yl]-ethylamino}-4-methylpentanoic acid) makes key binding interactions within the active site and offers insights regarding the action of residues involved in catalysis and substrate specificity. A few active site residue substitutions in ACE2 relative to ACE appear to eliminate the S2′ substrate-binding subsite and account for the observed reactivity change from the peptidyl dipeptidase activity of ACE to the carboxypeptidase activity of ACE2.

The catalytic domain of ACE2 is 42% identical to that of its closest homolog, somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (sACE; EC 3.4.15.1), a peptidyl dipeptidase that plays an important role in the renin angiotensin system for blood pressure homeostasis. The loss of ACE2 in knockout mice has no effect on blood pressure, but reveals ACE2 as an essential regulator of heart function (3Crackower M.A. Sarao R. Oudit G.Y. Yagil C. Kozieradzki I.

In a recent discovery, ACE2 was identified as a functional receptor for the coronavirus that is linked to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (4Li W. Moore M.J. Vasilieva N. Sui J. Wong S.K.

Of the seven best in vitro peptide substrates identified (kcat/Km > 105m-1 s-1), proline and leucine are the preferred P1 residues, with a partiality for hydrophobic residues in the P1′ position, although basic residues at P1′ are also cleaved (peptide-binding subsites in proteins are as previously defined (9Schechter I.

An examination of the ACE2 and ACE literature may be found in recently published reviews (10Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Trends Pharmacol.

We report here the first crystal structures of the extracellular metallopeptidase domain of ACE2 in its native and inhibitor-bound states and discuss the influence of these structures in understanding the substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. While preparing these ACE2 structures for publication, two reports on the crystal structures of testicular angiotensin-converting enzyme (tACE) and Drosophila ACE appeared in the literature (13Natesh R. Schwager S.L. Sturrock E.D. Acharya K.R. Nature. 2003; 421: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 14Kim H.M. Shin D.R. Yoo O.J. Lee H. Lee J.O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—A truncated extracellular form of human ACE2 (residues 1-740) was expressed in baculovirus and purified as described previously (8Vickers C. Hales P. Kaushik V. Dick L. Gavin J. Tang J. Godbout K. Parsons T. Baronas E. Hsieh F. Acton S. Patane M. Nichols A. Tummino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14838-14843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). The signal sequence (residues 1-18) is presumably removed upon secretion from Sf9 cells. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme is 89.6 kDa by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, which is greater than the theoretical molecular mass of 83.5 kDa expected from the sequence (residues 19-740). The difference of ∼6 kDa is believed to be due to glycosylation at the seven predicted N-linked glycosylation sites for this protein. Crystallization—Briefly, 2 μl of purified ACE2 (5 mg/ml) was combined with an equal volume of reservoir solution, and crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 16-18 °C. The best crystallization reservoir solution conditions for native ACE2 were found to be 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 200 mm MgCl2, and 14% polyethylene glycol 8000. Under these conditions, it took ∼2 weeks to grow single crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction. Similarly, diffraction-quality ACE2 crystals were also grown in the presence of an ACE2 inhibitor, MLN-4760 (ML00106791; (S,S)-2-{1-carboxy-2-[3-(3,5-dichlorobenzyl)-3H-imidazol-4-yl]-ethylamino}-4-methylpentanoic acid). Compound MLN-4760 corresponds to compound 16 of Dales et al. (15Dales N.A. Gould A.E. Brown J.A. Calderwood E.F. Guan B. Minor C.A. Gavin J.M. Hales P. Kaushik V.K. Stewart M. Tummino P.J. Vickers C.S. Ocain T.D. Patane M.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11852-11853Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Crystallization trials used 2 μl of reservoir solution plus 2 μl of ACE2 at 5.9 mg/ml containing 0.1 mm inhibitor. The best diffracting ACE2-inhibitor complex crystals were grown in the presence of 19% polyethylene glycol 3000, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 600 mm NaCl. Data Collection and Structure Determination—The best data set for native ACE2 was at 2.2-Å resolution and was collected at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory). A total of 44 x-ray data sets were collected for native ACE2, including a large number of heavy atom soaks of atoms that had good anomalous signals. The data sets for each derivative were collected at different wavelengths to maximize the anomalous signals for the bound heavy atoms. Native ACE2 data were collected to 2.2-Å resolution at λ = 1.28 Å to maximize the anomalous signal at the zinc absorption edge. The heavy atom positions were determined and confirmed by a combination of visual inspection of Patterson maps and automatic search procedures, which included SHAKE 'N BAKE (16Hauptman H.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and SHELXD (17Abrahams J.P. de Graaff R.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The heavy atom parameters were refined and optimized using the computer programs SHARP (18Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), MLPHARE (19Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering: Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1991: 80-86Google Scholar), and XHEAVY (20McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography.2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1999Google Scholar). The experimental phases were improved by solvent flattening and histogram matching. Once the native ACE2 structure was determined, it was used to solve the inhibitor-bound structure of ACE2 to 3.0-Å resolution using molecular replacement methods that employed the program AMoRe in the CCP4 software suite (21Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The native structure was split into two subdomains: subdomains I and II (see Fig. 3 for definition). Subdomain II was used for molecular replacement and refined in REFMAC5, which resulted in the appearance of electron density for subdomain I. Subdomain I was then fitted into the density by hand, and the structure was refined as a whole. Final refinement was accomplished using the software suite CNX (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

Native ACE2 Structure—The three-dimensional structure of the extracellular region of native ACE2 was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 23.5% (Rfree = 28.7%) at 2.2-Å resolution.

Open table in a new tab The extracellular region of the human ACE2 enzyme is composed of two domains. The first is a zinc metallopeptidase domain (residues 19-611), which is ∼42% identical to the corresponding domains of human sACE and tACE (Fig. 1). Electron density near the active site of native ACE2 is shown in Fig. 2a. An α-carbon trace for this metallopeptidase domain of ACE2 is shown in Fig. 3A. The second domain is located at the C terminus (residues 612-740) and is ∼48% identical to human collectrin (23Zhang H. Wada J. Hida K. Tsuchiyama Y. Hiragushi K. Shikata K. Wang H. Lin S. Kanwar Y.S. Makino H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17132-17139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the electron density map for much of the collectrin homology domain is weak. Only half of this domain is visible in the electron density map, and what can be seen is ambiguous due to topology and connectivity issues.Fig. 2Experimental electron density maps for native and inhibitor-bound ACE2 structures. a,an |Fo|-|Fc| omit electron density map of the zinc-binding site of the native ACE2 structure (His374-His378, His401-Glu406), calculated with phases from the refined model at 2.2-Å resolution.

The two catalytic subdomains are connected only at the floor of the active site cleft. One prominent α-helix (helix 17, residues 511-531) connects the two subdomains and forms part of the floor of the canyon. The deeply recessed and shielded proteolytic active site of ACE2 is a common structural feature of proteases and exists to avoid hydrolysis of correctly folded and functional proteins (24Fulop V. Bocskei Z. Polgar L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 25Rockel B. Peters J. Kuhlmorgen B. Glaeser R.M. Baumeister W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5979-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and is also consistent with the profiles of binding of tethered inhibitors to sACE (26Pantoliano M.W. Holmquist B. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1037-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Bernstein K.E. Welsh S.L. Inman J.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The N terminus-containing subdomain I and the C terminus-containing subdomain II are defined in Fig. 3B. This subdomain definition is based on the subdomain movement that was observed upon inhibitor binding (see below). The secondary structure of the metallopeptidase domain of ACE2 is composed of 20 α-helical segments and nine 310 helical segments that together make up ∼62% of the structure (Figs. 1 and 3). This contrasts with just six short β-structural segments that make up ∼3.5% of the structure. Glycosylation is suggested by the presence of electron density at all six potential N-linked sites: Asn53, Asn90, Asn103, Asn322, Asn432, and Asn546 (2Tipnis S.R. Hooper N.M. Hyde R. Karran E. Christie G. Turner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33238-33243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). The highest density was observed at Asn90, Asn103, and Asn546 and allowed the building of three N-acetylglucosamine groups. Three disulfide bonds of ACE2 (Cys133-Cys141, Cys344-Cys361, and Cys530-Cys542) are conserved in sACE and tACE (Fig. 1). The zinc-binding site is located near the bottom and on one side of the large active site cleft (subdomain I side), nearly midway along its length. The zinc is coordinated by His374, His378, Glu402, and one water molecule (in the native structure). These residues at the zinc-binding site of ACE2 make up the HEXXH + E motif conserved in the zinc metallopeptidase clan MA (28Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). A chloride ion (Cl-) is bound in native ACE2, coordinated by Arg169, Trp477, and Lys481 in subdomain II. The larger electron density compared with water supports the assignment of this density to a Cl- ion, as does as the larger than expected distances between the coordinating side chains and the Cl- ion (compared with water H-bonds): N-ϵ and N-η1 of Arg169 are both 3.2 Å from Cl-, indole ring nitrogen of Trp477 is 3.5 Å from Cl-, and N-ϵ of Lys481 is 5.0 Å from Cl-. Inhibitor-bound ACE2 Structure—The structure of ACE2 with an inhibitor bound at the active site was solved by molecular replacement to a resolution of 3.0 Å using the native ACE2 structure. Refinement statistics for the inhibitor-bound ACE2 structure are shown in Table II. The bound compound MLN-4760 potently inhibits human ACE2 (IC50 = 0.44 nm), but weakly inhibits tACE (IC50 > 100 μm) and carboxypeptidase A (IC50 = 27 μm) (15Dales N.A. Gould A.E. Brown J.A.

The structure of the bound inhibitor is shown in Fig. 2b along with the experimental electron density map near the active site. Ligand-dependent Subdomain Hinge-bending Movement—There is a clear difference between the native and inhibitor-bound ACE2 structures with respect to the distance separating the two subdomains (Fig. 4A). These two subdomains undergo a large inhibitor-dependent hinge-bending movement of one catalytic subdomain relative to the other (∼16°) that causes the deep open cleft in the native form of the enzyme to close around the inhibitor. This movement can be viewed when subdomain II from the native and inhibitor-bound ACE2 structures are superimposed (root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 1.41 Å for 409 residues) as shown in Fig. 4A. In this view, subdomain II remains essentially unchanged, but subdomain I moves to close the gap, essentially mimicking the action of a closing clam shell. The α-carbon atoms of some residues near the outer edge of the subdomain gap move as much as ∼13 Å, whereas residues lying near or on the hinge axis (residues 99 and 100, 284-293, 396 and 397, 409 and 410, 433 and 434, 539-548, and 564-568) are nearly stationary. The movement of residues within the active site is shown in Fig. 4B. This view is a close-up of Fig. 4A with subdomain II of the native and inhibitor-bound ACE2 structures superimposed. Many of these residues move as much as 6-9 Å after binding of the inhibitor. Similar subdomain hinge-bending motions have also been observed for other zinc metalloproteases (29Holland D.R.

The largest previously observed ligand-dependent movement for metalloproteases is a 14° hinge-bending subdomain motion demonstrated for Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase (open versus closed) that resulted in an ∼2-Å movement to close the N-terminal/C-terminal subdomain gap (29Holland D.R.

Inhibitor Binding Interactions and Implications for Substrate Specificity and Catalysis—Both metallopeptidase subdomains of ACE2 are nearly equally involved in binding of the inhibitor MLN-4760. Inspection of the interactions between MLN-4760 and ACE2 revealed important residues responsible for inhibitor binding and presumably for substrate binding and catalysis (Fig. 5). The inhibitor MLN-4760 has two carboxylate groups, one of which binds to the zinc atom by displacing the bound water molecule present in the native ACE2 structure. The zinc coordination sphere (His374, His378, and Glu402) is a subset of the 21 residues of ACE2 that are located within 4.5 Å of the bound inhibitor and that make up the greater part of the active site. Six of the most important of these residues contribute specific H-bonding interactions with MLN-4760 (Fig. 5). The side chains of Arg273, His505, and His345 are H-bonded to the terminal carboxylate of the inhibitor. The carbonyl oxygen atom of Pro346 and the N-ϵ atom of His345 are within H-bonding distance of the secondary amine group of the inhibitor. Thr371 is within H-bonding distance of the imidazole ring of the 3,5-dichlorobenzylimidazole group of MLN-4760. The phenolic group of Tyr515 donates an H-bond to the zinc-bound carboxylate group of the inhibitor. The carboxyl group of Glu375 is within H-bonding distance of the other oxygen atom of the zinc-bound carboxylate of MLN-4760, but is presumably not protonated until peptide hydrolysis occurs (see below). The zinc-bound carboxylate of MLN-4760 appears to mimic the zinc-bound tetrahedral intermediate characteristic of nucleophilic attack of the scissile bond by the zinc-bound water during peptide hydrolysis (35Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (672) Google Scholar). This transition state structure is usually stabilized by H-bonds donated by imidazole, phenolic, or guanidino functional groups of neighboring amino acid side chains in other zinc metalloproteases (30Grams F.

https://openalex.org/W2152684385,"Clusterin is a ubiquitous secretory heterodimeric disulfide-linked glycoprotein, which is implicated in several physiological processes, including immune regulation, cell adhesion and morphological transformation, lipid transportation, tissue remodelling, membrane recycling and cell-cell interactions. A large number of studies have focused their interest on clusterin gene products as mediators of cell cycle progression and cell death induction, although data on the different isoforms and their role in the different cell processes are still obscure. Recently, an increased clusterin expression in breast cancer has been reported. In order to elucidate the role of clusterin in tumor progression and whether one of its isoforms is preferentially expressed in tumorigenesis, we examined its presence throughout the different steps of human colon carcinoma, one of the best-characterized models of human tumor progression. The immunohistochemical observation of 30 bioptic and surgical colon specimens demonstrated a cell compartment clusterin translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm directly related to tumor progression. In fact, a nuclear localization found in healthy colonic mucosa is consistent with the involvement of the proapoptotic nuclear form in the regulation of cell cycle progression and in cell death induction. The progression towards high-grade and metastatic carcinoma leads to cytoplasmic clusterin distribution. Protein extracts from freshly isolated cells of the same patients confirm in high-grade carcinomas with metastatic nodes the complete loss of the proapoptotic nuclear form and a cytoplasmic overexpression of the highly glycosylated form. Data obtained from in vitro experiments confirm that this form is released in the extracellular space and corresponded to the fully glycosylated one. These data suggest that the controversial data on clusterin function in tumors may be related to the pattern shift of its isoform production. As the secreted form of clusterin is correlated to cell matrix formation, cell membrane remodeling and cell-cell adhesion, the overexpression of this form in highly aggressive tumors and metastatic nodes could be a potential new prognostic and predictive marker for colon carcinoma aggressiveness."

In Arabidopsis, cytosolic GS (GS1) was accumulated in roots when plants were excessively supplied with ammonium; however, the GS activity was controlled at a constant level. The discrepancy between the protein content and enzyme activity of GS1 was attributable to the kinetic properties and expression of four distinct isoenzymes encoded by GLN1;1, GLN1;2, GLN1;3 and GLN1;4, genes that function complementary to each other in Arabidopsis roots. GLN1;2 was the only isoenzyme significantly up-regulated by ammonium, which correlated with the rapid increase in total GS1 protein. GLN1;2 was localized in the vasculature and exhibited low affinities to ammonium (Km = 2450 ± 150 μm) and glutamate (Km = 3.8 ± 0.2 mm). The expression of the counterpart vascular tissue-localizing low affinity isoenzyme, GLN1;3, was not stimulated by ammonium; however, the enzyme activity of GLN1;3 was significantly inhibited by a high concentration of glutamate. By contrast, the high affinity isoenzyme, GLN1;1 (Km for ammonium < 10 μm; Km for glutamate = 1.1 ± 0.4 mm) was abundantly accumulated in the surface layers of roots during nitrogen limitation and was down-regulated by ammonium excess. GLN1;4 was another high affinity-type GS1 expressed in nitrogen-starved plants but was 10-fold less abundant than GLN1;1. These results suggested that dynamic regulations of high and low affinity GS1 isoenzymes at the levels of mRNA and enzyme activities are dependent on nitrogen availabilities and may contribute to the homeostatic control of glutamine synthesis in Arabidopsis roots.

Ammonium is assimilated into glutamine and glutamate through a consecutive reaction of GS and glutamate synthase (GOGAT), the so-called GS/GOGAT cycle. Plants have two types of GS isoenzymes that localize in different compartments: one located in the cytosol (GS1) and the other in the plastid/chloroplasts (GS2) (1Oaks A. Hirel B. Annu. Rev.

In the roots of legumes, GS1 is regulated by ammonium supplied from the environment or the symbiotic nitrogen fixation (18Hirel B. Bouet C. King B. Layzell D. Jacobs F. Verma D.P.S.

Transgenic studies with the soybean GS1 promoter suggested that ammonium-dependent regulation is specific for nitrogen assimilation in leguminous plants; the soybean-derived GS1 promoter was not able to display the ammonium-induced expression of reporter activity in tobacco (20Miao G.H. Hirel B. Marsolier M.C. Ridge R.W. Verma D.P.S. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 11-22PubMed Google Scholar). This poses questions of whether the stimulation of GS1 expression by ammonium is genuinely associated with symbiosis and whether dicotyledonous plants are furnished or not furnished with the regulatory mechanisms that may perceive the ammonium signal. The availability of ammonium also caused changes in the expression of some of the GS1 genes in non-leguminous plants. For example, among the five isoenzymes of GS1 (GS1a, GS1b, GS1c, GS1d, and GS1e) identified from maize (9Sakakibara H. Kawabata S. Takahashi H. Hase T. Sugiyama T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 49-58Google Scholar, 13Li M.G. Villemur R. Hussey P.J. Silflow C.D. Gantt J.S. Snustad D.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the mRNA of GS1c and GS1d accumulated following application of ammonium to roots, whereas those of GS1a and GS1b were suppressed under the same condition (22Sakakibara H.

In Arabidopsis, five putative genes for GS1, GLN1;1, GLN1;2, GLN1;3, GLN1;4, and GLN1;5, are encoded in the genome (23Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7006) Google Scholar). Oliveira and Coruzzi (24Oliveira I.C. Coruzzi G.M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) reported that the application of sucrose to the medium causes induction of GLN1;1, GLN1;2, and GLN1;3 mRNAs and that amino acids attenuated the effect of sucrose, suggesting that a metabolic regulation of GS1 is associated with the relative abundance of carbon skeleton versus amino acids accumulated in the root tissue. These results suggest a negative feedback regulation of GS1 by Gln or the downstream nitrogen metabolites as in the case of ammonium transporters. However, the exact functional roles and physiological diversities of the individual GS1 isoenzymes in Arabidopsis have not been well characterized. In the present study, we determined the kinetic properties and ammonium response of the Arabidopsis GS1 isoenzymes. We demonstrated that GS1 expressed in roots (GLN1;1, GLN1;2, GLN1;3, and GLN1;4) can be classified into two distinct groups, the high affinity and low affinity enzymes localized at the root surface and vasculature, respectively. The characteristics of the GS1 isoenzymes in Arabidopsis were fitted into the negative regulatory pathways of ammonium influx and assimilation, which is apparently different from those operated positively for the active assimilation of externally supplied ammonium in the roots of legumes and maize. The results presented here clearly demonstrated that the multiplicity of cytosolic GS1 in higher plants does not simply provide functional redundancy but, rather, confers specified roles to the individual isoenzymes bearing distinctive kinetic properties and ammonium responsiveness. This is the first report presenting the complete and precise data of enzymatic properties and cell type-specific localization of GS1 isoenzymes in higher plants.

To prepare polyclonal antibody against the rice recombinant GS1 protein, 500 μg of the purified antigen emulsified with adjuvant was injected into a rabbit. Additional injections (500 μg each) were done twice every 2 weeks. Whole blood was obtained from the carotid artery, and the antiserum was collected by centrifugation. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated in 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting.

Proteins cross-reacting with the antibodies were visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate-p-toluidine and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (Promega). GS Enzyme Assay—The Gln synthetic activity of GS was determined by quantifying l-Gln synthesized from ammonium and l-Glu (28Sakurai N. Hayakawa T. Nakamura T. Yamaya T.

Five microliters of filtrate was incubated with AccQ Fluor reagent (Waters, Milford, MA), and the resulting AccQ-derivative of Gln was measured by Waters 2695 high performance liquid chromatography system on an AccQ Tag column (3.9 mm diameter × 150 mm length; Waters) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Fig. 6GLN1;3 activity is inhibited by Glu. Kinetics of Gln synthetic activities of GLN1;1 (A), GLN1;2 (B), GLN1;3 (C), and GLN1;4 (D) were plotted against the concentration of Glu in the reaction mixture and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (solid line). The GLN1;3 activities shifted out from the Michaelis-Menten equation are indicated as dashed lines. The purified GS1 protein was incubated in a 0.1-ml assay mixture as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One microgram of GLN1;1 and GLN1;2 and 0.5 μg of GLN1;3 and GLN1;4 were used for the GS enzyme assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIThe kinetic properties of the Arabidopsis GS1 isoenzymesKmVmaxaPurified GS1 protein was incubated in a 0.1 ml assay mixture as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One microgram of GLN1;1, GLN1;2, and cell culture-derived GS1 and 0.5 μg of GLN1;3 and GLN1;4 were used for the GS enzyme assays.

Open table in a new tab Extraction of Proteins from Arabidopsis Plants—Approximately 0.2 g of frozen root or leaf tissues were homogenized in an equal volume of GS extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mer-captoethanol, and 5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone) (28Sakurai N. Hayakawa T. Nakamura T. Yamaya T. Planta. 1996; 200: 306-311Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using a chilled mortar and pestle or with MM-300 mixer mill (Qiagen). The homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min under 4 °C. The supernatants were immediately desalted on PD-10 (Amersham Biosciences) or Probe Quant G-50 Micro Columns (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The crude enzyme fractions obtained were stored in 50% (v/v) glycerol. Soluble protein content was determined by the Coomassie Blue dye binding method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard Purification of Native GS1 Protein from Arabidopsis Cell Culture— All of the steps of enzyme purification were performed in a cold room (4 °C). One hundred fifty grams of cultured cells were homogenized in 500 ml of GS extraction buffer using a chilled warring blender (28Sakurai N. Hayakawa T. Nakamura T. Yamaya T. Planta. 1996; 200: 306-311Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was fractionated by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation between 30 and 60% saturation. The precipitate was suspended in 50 ml of buffer A containing 1.2 m (NH4)2SO4 and then immediately loaded onto a HiTrap butyl-FF column (15 ml bed volume) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. The pooled fraction was saturated to 70% (NH4)2SO4 and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min. The precipitate was suspended in 2 ml of buffer A and loaded for gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200pg (320 ml bed volume) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. The fractions containing GS activities were further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a HiTrap Q HP (1-ml bed volume) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Protein was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m. Expression of Recombinant GS1 Proteins in E. coli—The KpnI and SalI sites were created on the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding region of GLN1 cDNAs by PCR using KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo). The amplified PCR products were cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen) and fully sequenced. The cDNA inserts were digested by KpnI and SalI and ligated into the KpnI and SalI sites of pQE2 (Qiagen) to produce the His6 fusion constructs, termed pQE2-GLN1;1, pQE2-GLN1;2, pQE2-GLN1;3, and pQE2-GLN1;4, respectively. E. coli HB101 was transformed with the recombinant construct and grown at 30 °C in 300 ml of LB medium containing 1 m sorbitol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When A600 reached 0.5, the culture was cooled down to 20 °C. One millimolar isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was supplied to induce the expression of recombinant GS1 proteins, and the culture was further incubated at 20 °C for 12 h by continuous shaking (180 rpm). Purification of Recombinant GS1 Enzymes—One volume of E. coli cell pellets collected by centrifugation was re-suspended in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole). Cell suspensions were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with lysozyme (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at the final concentration of 1 mg ml-1. After ultrasonication, the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation. The His-tagged protein in the soluble fraction was affinity-purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (1-ml bed volume) (Qiagen). Washing was carried out with a buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluates were desalted and equilibrated in buffer A using PD-10 (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was further purified by anion exchange chromatography with a HiTrap Q HP (1-ml bed volume) (Amersham Biosciences) using the AKTA Prime fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was eluted by 10 ml of a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 m, and the protein peak fractions were analyzed for the presence of a single band of recombinant GS1 protein (40 kDa) on a Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel. The Gln biosynthetic activities of the pooled fractions were assayed to determine the kinetic properties. Construction of GLN1 Promoter-Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Plants—The fusion gene constructs of Arabidopsis GLN1 gene promoters and EGFP (Clontech) for plant transformation were constructed as follows. The 2463-bp, 2501-bp, 1213-bp, and 1161-bp 5′-promoter regions of GLN1;1, GLN1;2, GLN1;3, and GLN1;4, respectively, were amplified from Col-0 Arabidopsis genomic DNA by PCR using KOD plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo). The BamHI site was created on the 5′-end of the forward primer. The reverse primer containing the NcoI restriction site (CCATGG) was created at the translation initiation site of GLN1 gene to make the promoter-GFP fusion. The amplified PCR products were cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen) and fully sequenced. The GLN1 promoter regions were cut out as BamHI-NcoI fragments and ligated with the NcoI-NotI fragment of EGFP (Clontech) and the NotI-EcoRI fragment of the nopaline synthase terminator (29Chiu W.L. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The resultant GLN1 promoter:EGFP:nopaline synthase terminator cassette was placed in the position of the β-glucuronidase and nopaline synthase terminator in the binary plasmid, pBI101 (Clontech). The binary plasmids were transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 (pMP90) (30Koncz C. Schell J Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 383-396Crossref Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) by the freeze-thaw method (31Höfgen R. Willmitzer L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9877Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis plants were transformed according to the floral dip method (32Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic plants were selected on GM medium (33Valvekens D. van Montagu M. van Lijsebettens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5536-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) containing 50 mg liter-1 kanamycin sulfate. Fluorescence of GFP in transgenic plants was observed under a BX61 microscope equipped with a FV500 confocal laser scanning system and a 505-525-nm band pass filter (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), as descried previously (34Yoshimoto N. Inoue E. Saito K. Yamaya T. Takahashi H. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Cytosolic GS1 Is the Major Form in Arabidopsis Roots—The mRNA and protein contents of GS1 and GS2 in Arabidopsis were determined by real time PCR and Western blot analyses (Fig. 1). Arabidopsis plants were grown on agar medium containing 7 mm nitrate as a sole nitrogen source for 14 days. The total GS1 mRNA was calculated as a sum of GLN1;1, GLN1;2, GLN1;3, GLN1;4, and GLN1;5 mRNAs. The gene-specific primer pairs that specifically amplify the transcripts of individual GS isoenzymes are described in Table I. The GS1 mRNA was ∼20-fold more abundant than GS2 mRNA in Arabidopsis roots (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis indicated accumulation of a 40-kDa protein that corresponds to the molecular size of GS1 in roots (Fig. 1B). GS2 (44 kDa) was hardly detectable in roots (Fig. 1B). The results indicate that GS2 mRNA is weakly expressed in roots as a minor GS isoenzyme; however, judging from the Western blots, the contribution of GS2 to the Gln synthesis is not appreciable as compared with GS1. Thus, we concluded that GS1 is the major isoenzyme that carries out the ammonium assimilation in Arabidopsis roots. In leaves, the mRNAs and proteins for both isoenzymes were expressed. On real time PCR, GS2 mRNA was slightly more abundant than GS1 mRNA in leaves (Fig. 1A). Western blot showed two major bands corresponding to the molecular sizes of GS2 and GS1 subunit proteins, respectively (Fig. 1B). Increased Accumulation of GS1 Protein by Ammonium Treatment Is Not Correlated with the GS Activity—The enzyme activity and the abundance of GS1 polypeptides were simultaneously monitored during a time course of ammonium treatment. Two week-old plants were deprived of nitrogen for 3 days and treated with 10 mm ammonium chloride. Root tissues were harvested for Western blotting and GS"

Starting from a high affinity peptide binder, originally obtained by ribosome display from a murine library, we generated libraries of mutants with error-prone PCR and DNA shuffling and applied off-rate selection by using ribosome display. Crystallographic analysis of the scFv in its antigen-bound and free state showed that only few mutations, which do not make direct contact to the antigen, lead to a 500-fold affinity improvement over its potential germ line precursor. These results suggest that the affinity optimization of very high affinity binders is achieved by modulating existing interactions via subtle changes in the framework rather than by introducing new contacts. Off-rate selection in combination with ribosome display can evolve binders to the low picomolar affinity range even for peptide targets.

These results suggest that the affinity optimization of very high affinity binders is achieved by modulating existing interactions via subtle changes in the framework rather than by introducing new contacts. Off-rate selection in combination with ribosome display can evolve binders to the low picomolar affinity range even for peptide targets. Directed evolution of proteins in vitro has become a widely applied strategy to generate proteins with a desired property (1Amstutz P. Forrer P. Zahnd C. Plückthun A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 400-405Google Scholar). Especially in the generation of high affinity binders, the iterative succession of randomization and selection was shown to efficiently mimic natural affinity maturation. The success of this approach is dependent on the size and the quality of the library and the power of the selection method used. Technologies that work entirely in vitro such as ribosome display (2Hanes J. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4937-4942Google Scholar) and mRNA display (3Roberts R.W. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12297-12302Google Scholar) are more favorable than methods that work partially in vivo such as phage display (4Smith G.P. Virology. 1988; 167: 156-165Google Scholar) or fully in vivo such as the yeast two-hybrid system (5Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Google Scholar) or the protein complementation assay (6Mössner E. Koch H. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 115-122Google Scholar) as the in vitro technologies do not need transformation of cells after each new round of randomization. Therefore, they allow the handling of much larger libraries and more cycles of randomization, and the experimental work is accelerated greatly. A prerequisite of any evolution is randomization between different selection rounds. In ribosome display this is facilitated by the use of linear DNA. The randomization occurs at a low rate by the intrinsic error rate of the polymerase used but can be enhanced by error-prone PCR (7Zaccolo M. Gherardi E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 775-783Google Scholar), by DNA shuffling (8Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Google Scholar), or both, thereby generating highly diverse pools. While the generation of binders having binding constants in the subnanomolar range can be achieved, e.g. with synthetic antibody libraries and established techniques (9Knappik A. Ge L. Honegger A. Pack P. Fischer M. Wellnhofer G. Hoess A. Wölle J. Plückthun A. Virnekäs B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 57-86Google Scholar), the generation of very high affinity binders with binding constants in the lowest picomolar affinity range is difficult for several reasons. First, a very stringent selection pressure must be applied to separate improved binders from the already very high affinity precursors. Second, selected binders must be eluted efficiently, which may become very difficult for binders with very slow off-rates. Here ribosome display offers a significant advantage since bound binders must not be eluted, but the ribosomally bound mRNA can be recovered by the addition of chelating agents, which destabilize the ribosomal complex (1Amstutz P. Forrer P. Zahnd C. Plückthun A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 400-405Google Scholar). In particular the generation of very high affinity peptide binders is made difficult by the relatively high flexibility of the peptide in the unbound state and the corresponding loss of entropy upon binding. This is less of a problem for comparatively rigid antigens such as hydrophobic small molecular weight compounds for which subpicomolar binders are known (10Boder E.T. Midelfort K.S. Wittrup K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10701-10705Google Scholar). We applied a competitive selection for increased off-rates to affinity mature a high affinity peptide binder previously selected with ribosome display from a murine library (11Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar). The peptide was derived from the yeast transcription factor GCN4. We constructed different mutants of a high affinity binder and generated from them second generation libraries using DNA shuffling and error-prone PCR. From these libraries we successfully isolated binders in the low picomolar affinity range. By determining the crystal structure both in the free and antigen-bound state we could show that the gain in affinity of 500-fold, compared with its likely germ line precursor, was almost exclusively a result of second sphere mutations not being in direct contact with the antigen. These findings may have great impact on future library design and affinity maturation strategies.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1154-1161Google Scholar), and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and subsequent antigen affinity chromatography as described previously (11Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar). For structure determination, a seleno-Met-containing variant of clone H6 was grown in 1 liter of M9 minimal medium to an OD600 of 0.6. An amino acid mixture containing 100 mg/liter each of Lys, Thr, and Phe and 50 mg/liter each of Leu, Ile, Val, and seleno-Met was added. After 1 h, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm for expression overnight. The protein was purified as described above. The Library Construction—The scFv fragments C11L34, L24, L107, L135, L107–135, H6, and H67 in the vector pAK400 were PCR-amplified using primers SDAla+ (5′-AGACCACAACGGTTTCCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATATCCATGGCGGACTACAAAGAT) and Sfi_rescue (5′-GCCCTCGGCCCCCGAGGC). A total of 1 μg of PCR product of an equimolar mixture of all clones was used for DNase I shuffling (14Adey N.B. Stemmer W.P.C. Kay B.K. Kay B.K. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins. Academic Press, Cambridge1996: 280-292Google Scholar) as described previously (15Jermutus L. Honegger A. Schwesinger F. Hanes J. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 75-80Google Scholar). Some of the reassembled PCR products were further randomized by error-prone PCR using primers SDAla+ and Sfi_rescue. Error-prone PCR was performed using the dNTP analogues 8-oxo-dGTP and dPTP according to Ref. 7Zaccolo M. Gherardi E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 775-783Google Scholar with small modifications. Twenty-six cycles of error-prone PCR were performed in the presence of 85 μm dPTP, 85 μm 8-oxo-dGTP, and 50 μm dGTP, dATP, dTTP, and dCTP each. The final mutation rate after DNase I shuffling and error-prone PCR and the distribution of the mutations were determined by sequencing about 2000 bp. A gene III linker was fused to the library as described earlier (11Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar). Selection for Improved Affinities—The library was transcribed and translated in vitro as described in Ref. 11Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar. The ternary complexes of ribosome, mRNA, and displayed proteins were equilibrated with 1 nm biotinylated peptide GCN4(7P14P) (16Berger C. Weber-Bornhauser S. Eggenberger J. Hanes J. Plückthun A. Bosshard H.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 149-153Google Scholar) at 4 °C overnight. Every sample was split into two aliquots, and only to one, 1 μm non-biotinylated GCN4(7P14P) was added. The aliquots were incubated for a defined time span, which was increased from round to round, starting with 2 h in the first round and going up to 10 days after the fourth round in a rollover shaker at 4 °C. The complexes were recovered by binding to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min. The beads were washed five times, and the RNA was eluted and purified as described in Ref. 11Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar. Affinity Comparison of Pools and Single Clones by Radioimmunoassay (RIA) and Inhibition BIACORE—For the analysis of single clones, the selected pools were cloned into pTFT74 (17Ge L. Knappik A. Pack P. Freund C. Plückthun A. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Antibody Engineering. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 229-266Google Scholar). RNA of single clones was transcribed directly from plasmid pTFT74, whereas the pools were transcribed from a PCR product. RIAs were performed as described previously (18Auf der Maur A. Zahnd C. Fischer F. Spinelli S. Honegger A. Cambillau C. Escher D. Plückthun A. Barberis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45075-45085Google Scholar). Of some clones, absolute affinities were measured using the inhibition method on a BIACORE 3000 (19Nieba L. Krebber A. Plückthun A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 155-165Google Scholar). The purified protein was diluted to 1 nm and incubated with different concentrations of antigen overnight at 4 °C. The samples were injected over a chip, which was coated to maximal density with the antigen used for selection. The slope of the association curves in the linear phase was plotted against the concentration of soluble antigen. KD was determined from at least three independent curves as described previously (11Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar). Crystallization—Crystals of clone H6 in complex with the antigen and clone C11L34 in the absence of the peptide were obtained using the hanging drop method. Drops of 1 μl (protein concentration, 8 mg/ml) of the unliganded Fv GCN4 were mixed with 1 μl of the well solution (1.1 m ammonium sulfate, 150 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.8). Crystals appeared after 2 days at 20 °C belonging to space group P212121 (a = 35.08 Å, b = 60.53 Å, and c = 123.05 Å) and contained one molecule per asymmetric unit (Vm = 2.29 Å3/Da, 46% solvent (20Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Google Scholar)). Crystals of the complex of H6 and the peptide YHLENEVARLKK were obtained by mixing the scFv and the peptide in a 1:2 molar ratio. Drops of 1 μlofthe complex (protein concentration, 7.4 mg/ml) were mixed with 1 μl of a solution containing 32–28% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The space group was P21 (a = 37.24 Å, b = 36.29 Å, c = 84.46 Å, β = 90.5°) with one complex per asymmetric unit and a specific protein volume of 2.03 Å3/Da. Data Collection and Processing—Data of the free scFv fragment were collected at 100 K on a MAR-Research Imaging Plate (MAR, Hamburg, Germany) placed on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode using the CuKα radiation. Crystals were frozen using 25% glycerol, and they diffracted to 2.6 Å. Data integration and reduction were performed using DENZO (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. Vol. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) and SCALA (22Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 (CCP4)Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). A crystal of the complex was frozen with 16% glycerol. Data were collected at 100 K in the beam-line ID14-EH4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), λ = 0.988 Å. The data reduction was performed with SCALA (22Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 (CCP4)Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar).

After each refinement cycle, a new map was calculated, and the model was fitted with Turbo-Frodo (27Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory.

The coordinates and structure factors of the free and peptide-bound Fv have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank at Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics as entries 1P4I and 1P4B, respectively. Library Construction—In a previous study, we selected a group of scFv fragments from a murine library by using ribosome display, a selection method that works entirely in vitro and therefore allows the selection from very large libraries (Fig. 1). The selected scFv fragments bound with very high affinity to the peptide GCN4(7P14P) derived from the yeast transcription factor GCN4 (11Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar, 16Berger C. Weber-Bornhauser S. Eggenberger J. Hanes J. Plückthun A. Bosshard H.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 149-153Google Scholar). The highest affinity clone, named “C11L34,” had an affinity of 40 pm and acquired a crucial amino acid substitution during ribosome display rounds that led to a 65-fold affinity improvement compared with its likely progenitor from the murine B-cells (11Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar). We constructed a second generation library in two steps. First, we generated five different point mutants of the high affinity clone and a double mutant, based on mutations that had been enriched in the first selection experiment, and measured their affinities (Table II and see Fig. 4). These mutants were taken as a template for the construction of three second generation libraries. The first pool, named “S,” was generated by using DNA shuffling of all seven clones including C11L34, thereby recombining all mutations (8Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Google Scholar). Two other pools were generated by the use of error-prone PCR. Pool “R” was generated by error-prone amplification of C11L34, and pool “SR” was generated by the combination of the two approaches: the mutants were amplified by error-prone PCR and then subjected to DNA shuffling.Table IISummary of the mutations and affinities of different GCN4 bindersCloneaThe first eight clones listed were found in a previous selection (11), and their mutations compared with C11L34 were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis.

National Institutes of Health Publication No. 91-3242, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar) and was retainede ND, not determined Open table in a new tab To enhance the mutation rate of the polymerases, we used high concentrations of the nucleotide analogues 8-oxo-dGTP and dPTP leading to mismatch incorporation (7Zaccolo M. Gherardi E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 775-783Google Scholar). The final mutation rates of the pools were determined as 8.9 kbp-1 for pool S, 61 kbp-1 for pool R, and 78 kbp-1 for pool SR. Taking into account that many mutations are silent or have no effect on binding, e.g. because they are located in the linker or the lower framework, we estimated that the randomized pools will have two to three relevant amino acid substitutions per gene. As a consequence of the PCR-based randomization we found that mutations that were introduced during an early PCR cycle were more prominent in the final library. This clustering of mutations could be circumvented in future experiments by the use of a high template concentration and very high error rates, thereby reaching the final mutation rate within fewer amplification cycles. Ribosome Display and Off-rate Selection—For ribosome display, all three libraries had to be fused to a protein spacer derived from gene III to allow the displayed protein to fold properly (15Jermutus L. Honegger A. Schwesinger F. Hanes J. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 75-80Google Scholar). Since panning followed by extensive washing would hardly be able to discriminate between binders with different affinities all lying in the picomolar range, we used a competitive selection for decreased off-rates. The ribosomal complexes formed after in vitro translation were equilibrated overnight with a 1 nm solution of biotinylated antigen. A 1000-fold excess of competitor antigen carrying no biotin label was then added, and the pools were incubated at 4 °C. All complexes dissociating from the biotinylated antigen, to which they were initially bound, will be captured by the competitor carrying no biotin label and thus cannot be bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Hence the duration of incubation with competitor is defining the stringency of the selection. The incubation was prolonged from round to round (2, 10, and 240 h), thereby increasing the selection pressure. After every round, selected mRNA was isolated and reverse transcribed, and the enriched pools were subjected to DNA shuffling. The pool SR was further randomized after the second round using the same conditions as in round 1. Interestingly the mRNA of pool R, which had been generated by error-prone amplification of C11L34 only but which had not been subjected to DNA shuffling, could not be restored after the first round of selection. This indicates the importance of recombination in conjunction with high mutation rates to preserve a fraction of the pool in an active form. Furthermore the long off-rate selection times underscore the stability of the non-covalent ribosomal complex, which can survive more than 20 days at 4 °C. Analysis of the Pools after Off-rate Selection—After every round of ribosome display, the pools were checked for improved binding by RIA (18Auf der Maur A. Zahnd C. Fischer F. Spinelli S. Honegger A. Cambillau C. Escher D. Plückthun A. Barberis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45075-45085Google Scholar). The pools were expressed in vitro in the presence of [35S]Met, equilibrated with different amounts of free antigen, and allowed to bind to surface-immobilized antigen. The amount of competitor antigen needed to inhibit the binding of the scFv fragments to surface-immobilized antigen correlates with the mean affinity of binders found in the pool under investigation and decreased from round to round (Fig. 2). In the initial error-prone randomized pool even high concentrations of competitor did not affect binding of the pool to the plate. After 240 h of off-rate selection, however, 0.1 nm antigen was sufficient to prevent 50% of the pool from binding to the surface compared with the uninhibited signal, giving evidence that the mean affinity of the binders in the pool had improved affinities compared with clone C11L34. The total signal intensity of the pools decreased from round to round, indicating that the percentage of rescued binders decreased from round to round due to the very stringent selection pressure. Screening for Binders—After the third round, pools SR and S were cloned, plasmids of single colonies were isolated, and in vitro expressed protein was analyzed by RIA. Only 7 of 54 clones (13%) showed a significant binding signal to the surface-immobilized antigen in the absence of competitor. All of these clones could be completely inhibited with 10 nm antigen. Four of them were inhibited at even lower concentrations than C11L34 and were therefore ranked as affinity improved. In pool S, which was generated by DNA shuffling, 4 of 15 (25%) clones analyzed showed binding to the antigen after the third round of directed evolution, but only one had an improved inhibition signal (Table II). Only a few molecules had reached improved affinities that let them survive the applied selection pressure, whereas the background signal, consisting of unspecific complexes and RNA sticking to the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, remained constant. To improve the ratio of binders over background, a nonstringent enrichment round was performed. After this enrichment, 14 of 16 (87%) randomly picked clones showed binding to the antigen, of which eight showed improved inhibition patterns compared with C11L34. Furthermore the signal intensity of the pool in the RIA increased by a factor of 120, indicating a strong enrichment of the binders in the pool over the nonspecific RNA. Thus, a non-selective enrichment round after extensive off-rate selection may be useful in general to amplify the selected clones. Sequences of the Clones with Improved RIA Signal—The clones showing the most promising RIA signal were sequenced. They carried an average mutational load of one to four amino acid substitutions, whereas zero to two mutations derived from shuffled input DNA (Table II). The mutations were distributed over both domains, and some mutations showed up several times. It is likely that they were found independently since they had different codon usage. Interestingly the only mutation lying in CDRs, L135(Asn → Asp), originated from the clones used for DNA shuffling. All other mutations were located in framework positions. BIACORE Measurements—The affinity of all clones generated by site-directed mutagenesis and used for the library construction was measured. In addition, the binding constant of the evolved clone showing the best RIA signal after off-rate selection was determined. All clones were expressed in the periplasm of E. coli and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and antigen affinity chromatography (18Auf der Maur A. Zahnd C. Fischer F. Spinelli S. Honegger A. Cambillau C. Escher D. Plückthun A. Barberis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45075-45085Google Scholar). The dissociation constant KD of the purifie"
https://openalex.org/W1976561610,"Several signalling pathways contribute to the regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), either during developmentally regulated processes or in cancer progression and metastasis. Induction of EMT in fully polarized mouse mammary epithelial cells (EpH4) by an inducible c-fos estrogen receptor (FosER) oncoprotein involves loss of E-cadherin expression, nuclear translocation of β-catenin, and autocrine production of TGFβ. Reporter assays demonstrate that both β-catenin/LEF–TCF- and TGFβ–Smad-dependent signalling activities are upregulated, probably coregulating mesenchymal-specific gene expression during EMT. Stable expression of E-cadherin in mesenchymal FosER cells decreased β-catenin activity and reduced cell proliferation. However, these cells still exhibited a defect in epithelial polarization and expressed E-cadherin/β-catenin complexes in the entire plasma membrane. On the other hand, inhibition of TGFβ–Smad signalling in mesenchymal FosER cells induced flat, cobblestone-like clusters of cells, which relocalized β-catenin to the plasma membrane but still lacked detectable E-cadherin. Interestingly, inhibition of TGFβ signalling in the E-cadherin-expressing mesenchymal FosER cells caused their reversion to a polarized epithelial phenotype, in which E-cadherin, β-catenin, and ZO-1 were localized at their correct lateral plasma membrane domains. These results demonstrate that loss of E-cadherin can contribute to increased LEF/TCF-β-catenin signalling, which in turn cooperates with autocrine TGFβ signalling to maintain an undifferentiated mesenchymal phenotype."

Only the fully processed and active mature enzyme can be detected in medium in which adult F. hepatica are cultured. However, immunocytochemical studies revealed that the inactive procathepsin L1 is packaged in secretory vesicles of epithelial cells that line the parasite gut. These observations suggest that processing and activation of procathepsin L1 occurs following secretion from these cells into the acidic gut lumen. Expression of the 37-kDa procathepsin L1 in Pichia pastoris showed that an intermolecular processing event within a conserved GXNXFXD motif in the propeptide generates an active 30-kDa intermediate form. Further activation of the enzyme was initiated by decreasing the pH to 5.0 and involved the progressive processing of the 37 and 30-kDa forms to other intermediates and finally to a fully mature 24.5 kDa cathepsin L with an additional 1 or 2 amino acids. An active site mutant procathepsin L, constructed by replacing the Cys26 with Gly26, failed to autoprocess. However, [Gly26]procathepsin L was processed by exogenous wild-type cathepsin L to a mature enzyme plus 10 amino acids attached to the N terminus. This exogenous processing occurred without the formation of a 30-kDa intermediate form.

Fasciola hepatica is a helminth parasite that causes liver fluke disease in cattle and sheep worldwide and has recently emerged as an important pathogen of humans (1MasComa S. Bargues M.D. Esteban J. Dalton J.P. Fasciolosis. CABI Publishers, Wallingford, UK1999: 411-435Google Scholar). Cathepsin L1, a major cysteine protease secreted by the parasite plays a pivotal role in various aspects of its pathogenicity. For example, the enzyme takes part in nutrient acquisition by catabolizing host proteins to absorbable peptides (2Tort J. Brindley P.J. Knox D. Wolfe K.H. Dalton J.P. Adv. Parasitol. 1999; 43: 161-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), facilitates the migration of the parasite through the host intestine and liver by cleaving interstitial matrix proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, and native collagen (3Berasain P. Goni F. McGonigle S. Dowd A. Dalton J.P. Frangione B. Carmona C. J. Parasitol. 1997; 83: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and is implicated in the inactivation of host immune defenses by cleaving immunoglobulins (4Smith A. Dowd A. McGonigle S.

Parasitol. 1993; 62: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Further, cathepsin L1 has recently been shown to suppress Th1 immune responses in infected laboratory animals making them susceptible to concurrent bacterial infections (6Brady M.T. O'Neill S.M. Dalton J.P. Mills K.H.G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5372-5378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7O'Neill S.M. Brady M.T. Callanan J.J. Mulcahy G. Joyce P. Mills K.H.

In this regard, we have shown that the induction of anti-cathepsin L immune responses prior to a challenge infection of F. hepatica larvae elicits high levels of protection in cattle against disease (10Dalton J.P.

Phylogenetic studies have shown that the F. hepatica cathepsin L1 belongs to an enzyme lineage that eventually gave rise to the mammalian cathepsin Ls, Ks, and Ss (2Tort J. Brindley P.J. Knox D. Wolfe K.H. Dalton J.P. Adv. Parasitol. 1999; 43: 161-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isolation of a cDNA encoding F. hepatica cathepsin L revealed that the enzyme, like its mammalian homologs, is synthesized as an inactive preproenzyme consisting of a prepeptide, a propeptide and mature enzyme region (13Roche L.

As the stability of the propeptide-protease complex is dependent on electrostatic interactions, reduction of the environmental pH, weakens the bond between the propeptide and the catalytic site. As a consequence, the proenzyme possibly adopts a looser conformation, in which the propeptide is bound less tightly into the active site making it more susceptible to proteolysis (16Rozman J. Stojan J. Kuhelj R. Turk V. Turk B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Jerala R. Zerovnik E. Kidre J. Turk V. J. Biol.

The precise mechanism of proteolytic conversion from proenzyme to mature enzyme is still actively debated. The three-dimensional structure of procathepsin L (14Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Ménard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and procathepsin B (28Musil D. Zucic D. Turk D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V.

Moreover, circular dichroism studies reveal that activation does not involve significant conformational changes in the structure of procathepsin L (15Menard R. Carmona E. Takebe S. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Mason P. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4478-4484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or procathepsin B (16Rozman J. Stojan J. Kuhelj R. Turk V. Turk B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, the initial event in autocatalysis may involve an active proenzyme, possibly created by the reduced pH, that cleaves another proenzyme in the vicinity of the N terminus and sets off a chain reaction (15Menard R. Carmona E. Takebe S. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Mason P. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4478-4484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Rozman J. Stojan J. Kuhelj R. Turk V. Turk B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies on procathepsin B and procathepsin S identified autoproteolytic intermediates of processing when cystatin was included in in vitro activation reactions, which supported the view that the segment of the propeptide that binds the active site cleft is susceptible to cleavage (31Quraish O. Storer A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8118-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it was suggested that an initial slow intramolecular cleavage event within this segment of the propeptide triggers a more rapid cascade of intermolecular cleavages at the N terminus (31Quraish O. Storer A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8118-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Earlier studies on the processing of yeast-expressed recombinant papain identified a conserved heptapeptide (Gly-Xaa-Asn-Xaa-Phe-Xaa-Asp) motif located between residues –42 and –36 in the propeptide that may be a site of initial cleavage in the pH-dependent autoactivation of the enzyme (32Vernet T. Berti P.J. de Montigny C. Musil R. Tessier D.C. Ménard R. Magny M.C. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10838-10846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the lowering of the pH perturbed the negative charge of Asp–36 resulting in a conformational change that switched on the processing events by allowing proteolysis to occur at the Ala–37/Asp–36 bond. Following this primary cleavage further removal of the remaining amino acids of the propeptide may result from the proteolytic activity of the intermediate species, resulting in fully active mature protease (32Vernet T. Berti P.J. de Montigny C. Musil R. Tessier D.C. Ménard R. Magny M.C. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol.

Given the importance of cathepsin L proteases in the virulence of F. hepatica and other helminth pathogens (2Tort J. Brindley P.J. Knox D. Wolfe K.H. Dalton J.P. Adv. Parasitol. 1999; 43: 161-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) it is important to understand the mechanisms of their synthesis, processing and activation. We have previously shown that cathepsin L1 is secreted by this parasite and therefore functions extracellularly (4Smith A. Dowd A. McGonigle S. Keegan P.S. Brennan G. Trudgett A. Dalton J.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 33Dalton J.P. O'Neill S.M. Stack C. Collins P. Walsh A. Sekiya M. Doyle S. Mulcahy G. Hoyle D. Khaznadji E. Moire N.

Investig. 2003; 111: 1733-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the present study we have employed confocal laser and electron immunocytochemistry to show that the enzyme is stored in secretory vesicles of the gastrodermal epithelial cells in its inactive proenzyme form. We investigate the autoactivation of F. hepatica cathepsin L1 using the wild-type proenzyme expressed in Pichia pastoris. Intermolecular processing was studied by generating an inactive procathepsin L mutant, where the catalytic Cys residue at position 26 was substituted with a Gly, which was incapable of autoactivation. Our results show that P. pastoris-expressed cathepsin L can autoactivate at low pH to an active intermediate form by an initial cleavage within the conserved heptapeptide (Gly-Xaa-Asn-Xaa-Phe-Xaa-Asp), as previously described for papain (32Vernet T. Berti P.J. de Montigny C. Musil R. Tessier D.C. Ménard R. Magny M.C. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10838-10846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Further activation of the enzyme occurs by cleavage in the vicinity of the N terminus. In contrast, intermolecular processing of the mutant inactive procathepsin L to a mature product by exogenous mature cathepsin L did not involve the formation of the above intermediate but was initiated by a direct cleavage close to the N terminus. These data provide a mechanism by which F. hepatica synthesizes and secretes a fully activated protease that is essential to its existence as a parasite.

Ni-NTA agarose and columns were obtained from Qiagen (Crawley, UK). In Vitro Cultivation of Parasites—Adult F. hepatica were obtained from infected cattle at a local abattoir and cultured in vitro in RPMI 1640 containing 30 mm HEPES, 1% glucose and 25 mg/ml gentamycin as described by Dalton and Heffernan (37Dalton J.P. Heffernan M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 35: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The medium was collected after 6 h, cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and stored at –20 °C. Preparation of Antipropeptide and Antimature Cathepsin L1 Anti-sera—Native mature cathepsin L1 (nFheCL1) was purified from excretory-secretory (ES) products of adult F. hepatica by gel permeation and ion exchange chromatography and antiserum prepared in rabbits as previously described (4Smith A. Dowd A. McGonigle S. Keegan P.S. Brennan G. Trudgett A. Dalton J.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 38Dowd A.J. McGonigle S. Dalton J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recombinant cathepsin L1 propeptide was generated and purified as described by Roche et al. (21Roche L. Tort J. Dalton J.P Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and antiserum prepared by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits five times with 20 μg of protein formulated in Freund's Complete and Incomplete Adjuvant. Immunofluorescence and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Adult F. hepatica were recovered from infected cattle at a local abattoir, washed, and transported to the laboratory in mammal saline (0.9% NaCl) at 37 °C. Parasites were rinsed in mammal saline and allowed to regurgitate their gut contents before being flat-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (pH 7.2) for 4 h. They were washed in antibody diluent (ABD: PBS with, 0.1% bovine serum albumin; 0.3% Triton X-100; 0.1% sodium azide) for 24 h before being incubated for 48 h at 4 °C in antiserum prepared against purified mature cathepsin L1 (diluted 1:3000) and subsequently washed in ABD (24 h, 4 °C). Swine anti-rabbit tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC; 1:100; Dako Ltd.) was used to visualize bound primary antibody before the worms were washed in ABD (24 h, 4 °C) and mounted on glass microscope slides in PBS/glycerol (1:9) containing 2.5% 2,4-diazabicylco 2.2.2 octane. Specimens were viewed using a Leica TCS-NT confocal scanning laser microscope. For electron microscopy worms were washed in mammal saline and fixed for 1 h in 2% double-distilled glutaraldehyde (GTA) (Agar Scientific) in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 3% sucrose at 4 °C. Following thorough washing in buffer, specimens were dehydrated through graded ethanol to propylene oxide, infiltrated and embedded in Agar 100 resin (Agar Scientific). Ultrathin sections (80–90 nm) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome, collected on bare 200-mesh nickel grids and dried at room temperature. For immunogold labeling sections were etched with 10% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min and rinsed thoroughly with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and Tween 20 (1:40 dilution). Grids were incubated in normal goat serum (1:20 dilution) for 30 min and then transferred to primary antibody diluted to 1:20,000 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/Tris-HCl buffer for 12–18 h. Grids were then washed in bovine serum albumin/Tris-HCl and transferred to a 20 μl drop of 10 nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio Cell International) for 2 h at room temperature. Following another buffer wash, grids were lightly fixed with 2% double-distilled GTA for 3 min, and finally washed with buffer and rinsed with distilled water. Grids were double stained with uranyl acetate (5 min) and lead citrate (3 min) and examined in a FEI (Philips) CM100 transmission electron microscope, operating at 100 keV. Controls consisted of (i) incubation of whole-mounts/sections with secondary antibody in the absence of primary antibody and (ii) incubation with preimmune serum followed by the secondary antiserum. Construction of Expression Vectors Encoding cDNA for Wild-type Procathepsin L1 (rFheproCL1) and Gly26 Procathepsin L1 (rmutFheproCL1) and Transformation into Pichia pastoris—The F. hepatica procathepsin L (FheproCL1) was amplified by PCR from the pAAH5 Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector into which the full-length cDNA had been previously cloned in our laboratory (13Roche L. Dowd A.J. Tort J. McGonigle S. McSweeney A. Curley G.P. Ryan T. Dalton J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Primers were used (see primers A and D below) to incorporate a SnaBI restriction site at the 5′-end of the gene and an AvrII restriction site and His6 tag sequence at the 3′-end. The 980-bp fragment was inserted into the AvrII/SnaB1 site of P. pastoris expression vector pPIC9K (Invitrogen). Mutants were generated from this construct by a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method known as gene splicing by overlap extension (SOEing) (39Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using the pPIC9K-FheproCL1 DNA as a template. The construction of the inactive FheproCL1 mutant involved changing the active site cysteine (Cys26) residue to a glycine in a two-step PCR process. The primers used were as follows: primer A, 5′-GCGGCTACGTATCGAATGATGATTTGTGGCAT-3′; primer B, 5′-GAATGCCCAACCGGAGCCAC-3′; primer C, 5′-GTGGCTCCGGTTGGGCATTC-3′; primer D, 5′-GCGCCTAGGTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGGCCC-3′. The underlined nucleotides indicate the replacements introduced. Each reaction used one flanking primer that hybridized at one end of the target sequence (primer A or D) and one overlapping internal primer that hybridizes at the site of the mutation and contains the mismatched base (primer B or C). In the first round of amplification two sections of the cDNA were amplified using primer combinations A+B and C+D. These two PCR products, with an overlap of 21 bp at one end of each fragment, were then combined in a second PCR to amplify the entire rmutFheproCL1 cDNA. Primers for this reaction were the two outside primers used in each of the two first round reactions (primers A and D). For all PCRs, high-fidelity Taq polymerase was used (25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min). The rmutFheproCL1 cDNA was then inserted into the AvrII/SnaB1 site of expression vector pPIC9K. Both the wild-type (rFheproCL1) and mutant (rmutFheproCL1) plasmid insert were sequenced to verify the presence of correct gene sequence and mutation. The rFheCLI or rmutFheCL1 plasmids were linearized by digestion with SalI and introduced to P. pastoris GSII5 cells by spheroplasting (40Higgins D.R. Cregg J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 103: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for their ability to grow on histidine-deficient agar plates and on agar plates containing minimal media and methanol. Insertion of rFheCLI or rmutFheCL1 into P. pastoris was confirmed by PCR using primers specific to the yeast genome (41Linder S. Schliwa M. Kube-Granderath E BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Procathepsin L1 and Gly26 Procathepsin L1—Yeast transformants were cultured in 250 ml of BMGY broth, buffered to pH 6.0, in 1 liter of baffled flasks at 30 °C until an OD600 of 2–6 was reached. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and protein expression induced by resuspending in 50 ml of BMMY broth, buffered at pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0, containing 1% methanol (41Linder S. Schliwa M. Kube-Granderath E BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cultures were grown at 30 °C with shaking at 225 rpm for 3 days, 1 ml samples were removed daily and then filter-sterilized methanol was added to maintain a final concentration of 1%. To assess the effect of the cathepsin L cysteine inhibitor Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone (-CHN2) on the production of procathepsin L1 by yeast the inhibitor was added at the time of induction to a final concentration of 25 μm and then twice daily at the same concentration over the subsequent 3 days. Recombinant proteins were purified from yeast medium by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). Briefly, a column prepared with 1 ml of resin was equilibrated by passing through 10 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. 10 ml of yeast media supernatant was mixed with 40 ml of the same buffer and applied to the column. The column was washed with 15 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole, and bound protein eluted using 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. Purified recombinant proteases were dialysed against PBS and stored at –20 °C. Samples of yeast medium supernatants (10 μl) and purified proteins (∼1–5 μg) were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting (see below). Fluorometric Substrate Assay for Cathepsin L1 Activity—Cathepsin L1 activity was determined by the fluorometric substrate assay described by Dowd et al. (38Dowd A.J. McGonigle S. Dalton J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Yeast culture supernatants or purified recombinant protease were assayed in a total volume of 1 ml of substrate/buffer mix (2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and 10 μm Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C and stopped after 30 min by the addition of 200 μl of 10% acetic acid. Fluorescence was recorded at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. The activity of the samples were calculated from a standard curve of NHMec ranging from 0 to 10 μm, and presented as nanomoles of NHMec min–1 ml–1. In Vitro Processing of Procathepsin L1 and Gly26 Procathepsin L1— Purified recombinant procathepsin L1 (∼5 μg) was incubated in activation buffer (0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, 1 mm DTT, and 1.25 mm EDTA) at 37 °C. Samples were taken at various time points up to 2 h and the proteolytic cleavage of the propeptide visualized by 12% SDS-PAGE. Aliquots were also assayed for enzyme activity with the specific substrate Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec as described above. Exogenous processing of Gly26 procathepsin L1 was carried out by mixing 5 μg of the purified mutant enzyme with 0.5 μg of wild-type procathepsin L that had been activated as described above. Processing of the mutant protein over a period of 3 h at 37 °C was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. To confirm that [Gly26]procathepsin L1 was expressed as a correctly folded protein a similar experiment was performed in parallel with mutant enzyme preparations that had been unfolded by heating at 95 °C for 3 min.

https://openalex.org/W2026965880,"Recently, it was revealed that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3) and 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25(OH)2D3) were metabolized to their respective epimers of the hydroxyl group at C-3 of the A-ring. We now report the isolation and structural assignment of 3-epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (3-epi-25(OH)D3 as a major metabolite of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) and the further metabolism of C-3 epimers of vitamin D3 metabolites. When 25(OH)D3 was incubated with various cultured cells including osteosarcoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and hepatoblastoma cell lines, 3-epi-25(OH)D3 and 24,25 (OH)2D3 were commonly observed as a major and minor metabolite of 25(OH)D3, respectively. 25(OH)D3 was at least as sensitive to C-3 epimerization as 1α, 25(OH)2D3 which has been reported as a substrate for the C-3 epimerization reaction. Unlike these cultured cells, LLC-PK1 cells, a porcine kidney cell line, preferentially produced 24,25(OH)2D3 rather than 3-epi-25(OH)D3. We also confirmed the existence of 3-epi-25(OH)D3 in the serum of rats intravenously given pharmacological doses of 25(OH)D3. The cultured cells metabolized 3-epi-25(OH)D3 and 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3 to 3-epi-24,25(OH)2D3 and 3-epi-1α,24,25(OH)3D3, respectively. In addition, we demonstrated that 3-epi-25(OH)D3 was metabolized to 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3 by CYP27B1 and to 3-epi-24,25(OH)2D3 by CYP24 using recombinant Escherichia coli cell systems. 3-Epi-25(OH)D3, 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3, and 3-epi-24,25(OH)2D3 were biologically less active than 25(OH)D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 24,25(OH)2D3, but 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3 showed to some extent transcriptional activity toward target genes and anti-proliferative/differentiation-inducing activity against human myeloid leukemia cells (HL-60). These results indicate that C-3 epimerization may be a common metabolic pathway for the major metabolites of vitamin D3.

In addition, we demonstrated that 3-epi-25(OH)D3 was metabolized to 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3 by CYP27B1 and to 3-epi-24,25(OH)2D3 by CYP24 using recombinant Escherichia coli cell systems. 3-Epi-25(OH)D3, 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3, and 3-epi-24,25(OH)2D3 were biologically less active than 25(OH)D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 24,25(OH)2D3, but 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3 showed to some extent transcriptional activity toward target genes and anti-proliferative/differentiation-inducing activity against human myeloid leukemia cells (HL-60). These results indicate that C-3 epimerization may be a common metabolic pathway for the major metabolites of vitamin D3. It is now well established that vitamin D3 is a precursor of the sterol hormone 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3). 1The abbreviations used are: 1α,25(OH)2D3,1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; 24,25(OH)2D3, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; droxyvitamin 25(OH)D3, 25-hy-D3; 1α,24,25(OH)3D3, 1α,24R,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3; VDR, vitamin D receptor; DBP, vitamin D-binding protein (Gc-globulin); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FCS, fetal calf serum; 3-epi-25(OH)D3, 3-epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3; VDRE, vitamin D-responsive element; R.

Vitamin D3 is made from 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin on exposure to ultraviolet light and metabolized to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) in the liver. 25(OH)D3 is further metabolized to the most active form of vitamin D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, or the inactive form, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25(OH)2D3), in the kidney (1DeLuca H.F.

The newly discovered C-3 epimerization pathway leads to the conversion of the configuration of the hydroxyl group at C-3 of the A-ring and produces 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3 from 1α,25(OH)2D3. In view of this modification at the A-ring, the C-3 epimerization pathway is quite different from side chain oxidation pathways. The C-3 epimerization of 1α,25(OH)2D3 was observed in human colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells (11Bischof M.G. Siu-Caldera M.-L. Weiskopf A. Vouros P. Cross H.S. Peterlok M. Reddy G.S. Exp.

From these studies, the C-3 epimerization pathway is assumed to be cell-selective. It was considered that the C-3 epimerization pathway is cell differentiation-related in Caco-2 cells, because 3-epi-1α,25 (OH)2D3 was only observed in confluent, quiescent Caco-2 cells, not proliferating Caco-2 cells (11Bischof M.G.

Siu-Caldera M.-L. Weiskopf A. Vouros P. Muralidharan K.R. Okamura W.H. Uskokovic M.R. Reddy G.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, synthetic analogs of 1α,25(OH)2D3, e.g. 22-oxacalcitriol (16Kamao M. Tatematsu S. Hatakeyama S. Ozono K. Kubodera N. Reddy G.S. Okano T. J. Biol.

Ogasawara A. Shimada K. Anal. Sci. 2000; 16: 477-482Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether 25(OH)D3 would be metabolized to its C-3 epimer, 3-epi-25(OH)D3. 25(OH)D3 is the most abundant circulating metabolite of vitamin D3 with a concentration of 20–50 ng/ml under normal conditions (22Napoli J.L. Horst R.L. Vitamin D Metabolism. Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht1984: 91-123Google Scholar). 25(OH)D3 is the immediate precursor of the active and hormonal form, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and the inactive form, 24,25(OH)2D3. Metabolism of 25(OH)D3 is important for regulation of the biological activity of vitamin D3. In the present study, we investigated the metabolism of 25(OH)D3 in rat osteosarcoma cells (UMR 106) and identified 3-epi-25(OH)D3 using 1H NMR spectroscopy and LC-MS techniques. 3-Epi-25(OH)D3 was detected in various cell models cultured with 25(OH)D3in vitro and in the serum of rats administered pharmacological doses of 25(OH)D3in vivo. We also demonstrated that 3-epi-25(OH)D3 was further metabolized by 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) and 24-hydroxylase (CYP24). The results indicated that 25(OH)D3 was metabolized through the C-3 epimerization pathway like 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3. C-3 epimerization is a common metabolic pathway for the major metabolites of vitamin D3. Materials—3-Epi-25(OH)D3, 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3, and 3-epi-24,25(OH)2D3 were synthesized in our laboratory. 25(OH)D3, 1α, 25(OH)2D3, and 24,25(OH)2D3 were obtained from Solvay-Duphar Co. (Weesp, The Netherlands). 1α,24R,25-Trihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α, 24,25(OH)3D3) was kindly provided by Kureha Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. [26,27-methyl-3H]1α,25(OH)2D3 (179 Ci/mmol) and [23,24-3H]25(OH)D3 (82 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Deuterized chloroform (CDCl3, 99.8%, NMR analytical grade) was purchased from Euriso-top (Gif-Sur-Yvette, France). Organic solvents of HPLC grade were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. Cell Culture—A rat osteosarcoma cell line (UMR 106), human osteosarcoma cell line (MG-63), human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2), porcine kidney cell line (LLC-PK1), and human hepatoblastoma cell line (Hep G2) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). UMR 106 and MG-63 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. Caco-2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium containing 10% FCS and 1% non-essential amino acids. LLC-PK1 cells were maintained in Medium 199 containing 5% FCS. Hep G2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium containing 10% FCS, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1% sodium pyruvate. All culture media contained penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of CO2 in air with a change of medium every 3 days. In the experiments described below, vitamin D3 compounds were added to the culture medium in an ethanolic solution, the final concentration in the medium never exceeding 0.1% (v/v). Generation of 25(OH)D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, 24,25(OH)2D3, 3-Epi-25(OH)D3, and 3-Epi-1a,25(OH)2D3 Metabolites in Cultured Cells— UMR 106, MG-63, and LLC-PK1 cells (2 × 106) and Caco-2 and Hep G2 cells (4 × 106) were seeded in 150-mm culture dishes and cultured for 4 days to late log phase. The medium was removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline without calcium, magnesium (PBS(–)) and then in medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of 10 μm of 25(OH)D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, 24,25(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, or 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3 for 48 h at 37 °C. For measurements of vitamin D3 metabolites, three 150-mm culture dishes were used for each culture. For time course experiments, the cells were incubated with 5 μm of 25(OH)D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, or 1 μm of 1α,25(OH)2D3, 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3 for a period ranging from 1 to 48 h. Purification of Metabolites—Lipid extraction was performed according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1957; 37: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42855) Google Scholar) as modified by Makin et al. (4Makin G. Lohnes D. Byford V. Ray R. Jones G. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Lipid was extracted from cells and medium with methanol and dichloromethane. The organic layer, containing unchanged substrate and lipid-soluble metabolites, was evaporated under nitrogen gas to dryness, and the residue was redissolved in hexane/2-propanol/methanol (HIM) (88:10:2, v/v/v). HPLC was carried out using a model 600 pump and a model 996 photodiode array detector (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Elution was performed on a Zorbax SIL column (4.6 × 250 mm, Dupont Instruments), using HIM (88:10:2), at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min (first HPLC system). Metabolites were identified based on UV characteristics of the vitamin D cis-triene system (λmax = 265 nm, λmin = 228 nm). The same metabolites were also separated on a Sumichiral OA-2000 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Sumika Chemical Analysis Service, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) using 2-propanol/hexane (96.5:3.5 or 94.5:5.5, v/v) or a Zorbax CN column (4.6 × 250 mm, Dupont Instruments) using HIM (88:10:2) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min (second HPLC system). Concentrations of stock solutions of vitamin D3-related compounds were determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient, ϵ265 = 18,200. 1H NMR and LC-MS Analyses—The 500-MHz 1H NMR spectra of the isolated metabolites were measured on a Varian VXR-500 (1H, 499.9 MHz). Purified metabolites (3 μg) were dissolved in 40 μl of CDCl3 with a very small portion of CHCl3 (7.24 ppm, used as an internal standard for 1H NMR spectroscopy) and transferred into a nano probe. Two-dimensional COSY and two-dimensional NOESY spectra were obtained as described previously (16Kamao M. Tatematsu S. Hatakeyama S. Ozono K. Kubodera N. Reddy G.S. Okano T. J. Biol.

LC-MS analysis was carried out with a QuattroII (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with an electrospray ionization source in the positive ion mode. An HPLC system consisting of a MAGIC2002 Micro-LC full system (Michrom Bio Resources) and a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (2.0 × 150 mm, Nomura Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) was used. As a mobile phase, methanol, 10 mm ammonium acetate (50:50, v/v, A) and methanol, 10 mm ammonium acetate (98:2, v/v, B) were used, and a linear gradient elution was run from an A/B ratio of 65:35 to 20:80 at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C. Mass spectra were obtained by averaging each peak and subtracting the background. In Vivo Metabolism of 25(OH)D3 in Rats—Male Wistar rats (Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan), weighing ∼300 g, were used in experiments, following adaptation to laboratory conditions for at least 5 days. Three rats were given a bolus dose of 500 μg of 25(OH)D3 intravenously. At 6 h after dosing, each rat was killed, and the blood was collected, heparinized, and immediately centrifuged. About 5 ml of serum was obtained from each rat. Lipid extraction of serum and purification of 25(OH)D3 metabolites were performed as described under “Purification of Metabolites.” Metabolism of 3-Epi-25(OH)D3 in Cultures of Recombinant E. coli Cells Expressing CYP27B1 and CYP24 —Co-expression plasmids for human CYP27B1, bovine adrenodoxin, and NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase were constructed as described (pKSNdl-CYP27B1) (24Sawada N. Sakaki T. Kitanaka S. Takeyama K. Kato S. Inouye K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Coexpression plasmids for CYP24, adrenodoxin, and adrenodoxin reductase were reported previously (pKSNdl-CYP24) (25Sakaki T. Sawada N. Komai K. Shiozawa S. Yamada S. Yamamoto K. Ohyama Y. Inouye K.

Recombinant Escherichia coli cells transfected with the above plasmids (JM109/pKSNdl-CYP27B1 or JM109/pKSNdl-CYP24) were grown in TB medium (26Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Sakaki T. Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Yabusaki Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 26 °C. The induction of transcription was initiated by addition of isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside at a final concentration of 1 μm when the cell density (OD660) reached 0.5. Then 50 μm of 25(OH)D3 or 3-epi-25(OH)D3 was added to the culture, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. Lipid extraction and purification of metabolites were performed as described under the “Purification of Metabolites.” Recombinant E. coli cells transfected with pKSNdl derived from pKK233-3 (JM109/pKSNdl) were used for control experiments. VDR and DBP Binding Assay—The binding affinity of 1α,25(OH)2D3, 25(OH)D3, 24,25(OH)2D3, and their C-3 epimers for the VDR was tested using a calf thymus 1α,25(OH)2D3 receptor assay (Yamasa Co., Chiba, Japan). The receptor was incubated at 20 °C for 1 h with increasing concentrations of a vitamin D3 compound, and then 15,000 dpm of [3H]1α,25(OH)2D3 was added and incubated for 1 h at 20 °C as described previously (16Kamao M.

The cells were incubated with 1α,25(OH)2D3 (10–11–10–7m) or the other vitamin D3 compounds (10–9–10–6m) for 48 h. The luciferase activities of the cell lysates were measured with a luciferase assay system (Toyo Ink Co., Ltd.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transactivation measured as luciferase activity was standardized with the luciferase activity of the same cells determined with the Sea Pansy luciferase assay system as a control (Toyo Ink Co., Ltd.) (31Lorenz W.W. McCann R.O. Longiaru M. Cormier M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Anti-proliferative Activity Assay—The human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were kindly provided by Dr. M. Inaba, Osaka City University Medical School, Japan. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo) supplemented with 10% FCS and 60 mg/liter kanamycin. For flow cytometry, HL-60 cells (105 cells/well) were placed in 24-well tissue culture plates and cultured for 3 days with 1α,25(OH)2D3 (10–11 –10–7m) or the other vitamin D3 compounds (10–9–10–6m). Each group of cells was washed with PBS(–) and resuspended in PBS(–) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 100 μgof RNase, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS(–) and incubated with 0.5 ml of DNA-staining solution containing propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 20 min. The cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser (488 nm, BD Biosciences FACScan™), and the cell cycle distribution was analyzed using ModiFiT LT (Verity). Analysis of Cell Surface Antigen Expression—For the analysis of cell surface expression of CD-11b antigen, HL-60 cells (105 cells/well) were cultured for 3 days with 1α,25(OH)2D3 (10–11 –10–7m) or the other vitamin D3 compounds (10–9–10–6m) under the same conditions as for flow cytometry. Each group of cells was washed with PBS(–), and the cells (2 × 105 cells) were resuspended in 100 μl of diluent solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% sodium azide. Then the cells were incubated with 10 μl of human monoclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated CD11b antibody (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed once with diluent solution and then fixed in 300 μl of PBS(–) containing 2% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescence was detected on a BD Biosciences FACScan™ at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm. Results were recorded as the mean fluorescence index, which is the product of the % fluorescence and the mean fluorescence intensity, with 104 cells being counted per treatment. Metabolism of 25(OH)D3 in UMR 106 Cells—After incubation of 10 μm of 25(OH)D3 with UMR 106 cells for 48 h, lipid extracts from the media along with the cells were subjected to a first HPLC using a Zorbax SIL column (Fig. 1A). The major peak, peak 2 corresponding to the authentic standards of 25(OH)D3 (retention time (R.T.) 5.67 min) and 3-epi-25(OH)D3 (R.T. 5.68 min), was collected in a single fraction eluting between 5 and 7 min. The eluate was then subjected to a second HPLC using a Sumichiral OA-2000 column for the separation of 3-epi-25(OH)D3 (R.T. 16.92 min) from 25(OH)D3 (R.T. 18.14 min) (Fig. 1B). The middle peak (peak 2′, R.T. 16.95 min), which possesses the characteristic UV chromophore of vitamin D3 (λmin 228 nm, λmax 265 nm), exhibited the same retention time as authentic 3-epi-25(OH)D3 but a different retention time to 25(OH)D3. The metabolite corresponding to peak 2′ was not formed when 25(OH)D3 was incubated with the medium alone. It is clear from the HPLCs shown in Fig. 1 that peak 2′ is the major metabolite of 25(OH)D3 produced in UMR 106 cells. Peak 2′ was collected in sufficient quantity to permit identification by 1H NMR and LC-MS analyses. Peak 1′ (R.T. 16.30 min), which possesses the characteristic UV chromophore of previtamin D3 (λmin 228 nm, λmax 260 nm), was also observed in a control incubation with no cells, only medium. Peak 4 in the first HPLC system corresponding to authentic standards of 24,25(OH)2D3 (R.T. 8.27 min) and 3-epi-24,25(OH)2D3 (R.T. 8.16 min) was collected and purified twice as described previously (20Kamao M. Tatematsu S. Reddy G.S. Hatakeyama S. Sugiura M. Ohashi N. Kubodera N. Okano T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 2001; 47: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 24,25(OH)2D3 was contained in this fraction; however, 3-epi-24,25(OH)2D3 was not detected (data not shown). Identification of 3-Epi-25(OH)D3 by 1H NMR and LC-MS Analyses—The 1H chemical shifts assigned based on one- and two-dimensional COSY, NOESY spectra of synthetic standards and the 25(OH)D3 metabolite (peak 2′) are summarized in Table I. In the 1H NMR spectrum, the most pronounced difference between 25(OH)D3 and 3-epi-25(OH)D3 was the chemical shift of H-3 (25(OH)D3, 3.93 ppm; 3-epi-25(OH)D3, 3.86 ppm). The chemical shift of H-3 of peak 2′ (3.86 ppm) was observed at the same position as 3-epi-25(OH)D3 upfield in comparison with 25(OH)D3. Such an upfield shift appears to be responsible for the C-3 epimerization in the A-ring of 25(OH)D3. The resonances from all the protons except H-3 were proof of an unchanged side chain as well as the cis-triene system. In the LC-MS spectra of authentic 25(OH)D3 and 3-epi-25(OH)D3, [M + H]+ and [M + NH4]+ were observed at m/z 401.8 and 418.8 (Table I). In the spectrum of peak 2′, [M + H]+ and [M + NH4]+ were also observed at m/z 401.8 and 418.8. Thus peak 2′ was considered to be a diastereomer or a geometric isomer of 25(OH)D3. From the results of HPLC, 1H NMR, and LC-MS analyses, peak 2′ could be assigned as 3-epi-25(OH)D3, a diastereomer of a hydroxyl group at C-3 of the A-ring of 25(OH)D3.Table I1H NMR and LC-MS analyses of 25(OH)D3 metabolitesCompound1H NMR analysis, 1H chemical shifts and coupling constantsaChemical shifts are in ppm; coupling constants are in Hz.LC-MS analysis, characteristic ionsH-1H-2H-3H-6H-7H-18H-19H-21H-26,27m/z25(OH)D32.16 (1H, ddd, J = 5.0, 8.0, 13.5)1.66 (1H, m)3.93 (1H, m)6.21 (1H, d, J = 11.5)6.01 (1H, d, J = 11.5)0.52 (3H, s)4.80 (1H, m)0.92 (3H, d, J = 6.5)1.19 (6H, s)418.8 [M + NH4]+401.8 [M + H]+2.38 (1H, ddd, J = 4.5, 8.0, 13.5)1.96 (1H, m)5.03 (1H, m)3-epi-25(OH)D32.13 (1H, ddd, J = 4.5, 10.0, 14.5)1.66 (1H, m)3.86 (1H, m)6.21 (1H, d, J = 11.5)6.02 (1H, d, J = 11.5)0.53 (3H, s)4.82 (1H, m)0.92 (3H, d, J = 6.5)1.20 (6H, s)418.8 [M + NH4]+401.8 [M + H]+2.38 (1H, ddd, J = 5.5, 5.5, 14.0)1.96 (1H, m)5.04 (1H, m)25(OH)D3 metabolite (Peak 2′)2.13 (1H, ddd, J = 4.5, 10.0, 14.5)1.66 (1H, m)3.86 (1H, m)6.21 (1H, d, J = 11.5)6.02 (1H, d, J = 11.5)0.53 (3H, s)4.82 (1H, m)0.92 (3H, d, J = 6.5)1.23 (6H, s)418.8 [M + NH4]+401.8 [M + H]+2.38 (1H, ddd, J = 5.5, 5.5, 14.0)1.96 (1H, m)5.04 (1H, m)a Chemical shifts are in ppm; coupling constants are in Hz."
https://openalex.org/W2061875179,"T cell receptor (TCR) induces a series of signaling cascades and leads to activation of multiple transcription factors, including NF-κB. Although the mechanism of TCR-induced NF-κB activation is not fully understood, recent studies indicate that Bcl10 and CARMA1, two adaptor/scaffold proteins, play essential roles in mediating TCR-induced NF-κB activation. MALT1/paracaspase is a caspase-like protein that contains an N-terminal death domain, two Ig-like domains, and a C-terminal caspase-like domain. It binds to Bcl10 through its Ig-like domains and cooperates with Bcl10 to activate NF-κB. Recently, it has been shown that MALT1 is involved in mediating TCR signal transduction, leading to activation of NF-κB. In this study, we show that MALT1 is recruited into the lipid rafts of the immunological synapse following activation of the TCR and the CD28 coreceptor (CD3/CD28 costimulation). This recruitment of MALT1 is dependent on CARMA1 because CD3/CD28 costimulation failed to recruit MALT1 into lipid rafts in CARMA1-deficient T cells. In addition, we also found that MALT1 not only binds to Bcl10 directly, but also associates with CARMA1 in a Bcl10-independent manner. Therefore, MALT1, Bcl10, and CARMA1 form a trimolecular complex. Expression of a MALT1 deletion mutant containing only the N-terminal death domain and the two Ig-like domains completely blocked CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced, but not tumor necrosis factor-α-induced, NF-κB activation. Together, these results indicate that MALT1 is a crucial signaling component in the TCR signaling pathway.

Together, these results indicate that MALT1 is a crucial signaling component in the TCR signaling pathway. T cell activation plays a critical role in regulation of the immune response. Dysregulation of this process results in cancer, autoimmunity, and immunodeficiency diseases. T cell activation is initiated by major histocompatibility complex molecules on antigen-presenting cells presenting antigen peptides to T cell receptors (TCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IKK, IκB kinase; PKCθ, protein kinase Cθ; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; MALT, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IKK, IκB kinase; PKCθ, protein kinase Cθ; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; MALT, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. on the surface of T cells. This stimulation of TCR-CD3 complexes induces a series of signal transduction events leading to activation of multiple transcription factors such as AP-1, NF-AT, and NF-κB (1Clements J.L. Boerth N.J. Lee J.R. Koretzky G.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 89-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Rudd C.E.

However, stimulation of TCR/CD3 complexes alone is insufficient to activate T cells. Instead, this signal will induce T cell anergy or apoptosis. The complete activation of T cells requires a second “costimulatory” signal generated through interactions between B7-1(CD80)/B7-2(CD86) molecules on antigen-presenting cells and CD28 receptors on T cells. This combined stimulation of TCR/CD3 and CD28 molecules (known as CD3/CD28 costimulation) leads to optimal activation of multiple transcription factors, including NF-κB, and subsequent production of interleukin-2 and other cytokines (4Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The NF-κB family of transcription factors plays a critical role in controlling expression of various cytokine and anti-apoptotic genes. NF-κB activity is regulated through interactions with a series of cytoplasmic inhibitory proteins termed IκB, which mask the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB, thereby sequestering NF-κB in the cytoplasm. Treatment of cells with various stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β, and CD3/CD28 costimulation initiates signal transduction cascades leading to activation of IκB kinase (IKK). IKK phosphorylates two regulatory serines located in the N terminus of IκB, triggering rapid ubiquitination and proteolysis of IκB in the 26 S proteasome complex (5Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB molecules unmasks the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB. NF-κB that is released from IκBα rapidly translocates into the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of various genes centrally involved in immune and anti-apoptotic responses (6Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar). Following CD3/CD28 costimulation, a large multicomponent complex at the contact area between the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell is formed, termed the supramolecular activation complex or the immunological synapse (7Dustin M.L. Olszowy M.W. Holdorf A.D. Li J. Bromley S. Desai N. Widder P. Rosenberger F. van der Merwe P.A. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The contact area of the T cell is highly enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, also termed lipid rafts. Some signaling molecules such as Lck and LAT are constitutively associated with the lipid rafts, whereas other key signaling molecules such as protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ), ZAP70, Vav, SLP-76, and IKKβ are recruited into the lipid rafts following CD3/CD28 costimulation (8Bromley S.K. Burack W.R. Johnson K.G. Somersalo K. Sims T.N. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 375-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Although it is not fully understood how signaling induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation leads to activation of NF-κB, recent studies indicate that phospholipase Cγ1 is essential for CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-κB activation (9Dienz O. Moller A. Strecker A. Stephan N. Krammer P.H. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The activated phospholipase Cγ1 hydrolyzes inositol phospholipids into inositol polyphosphates and diacylglycerols. The production of inositol polyphosphates then leads to an elevation of calcium through mobilization of intracellular stores. Subsequently, the elevated intracellular calcium and diacylglycerol activate PKC. Among the multiple isoforms of PKC that are activated following CD3/CD28 costimulation, only PKCθ, a Ca2+-independent PKC isoform, is recruited into membrane lipid rafts of the immunological synapse. Previous studies indicate that PKCθ plays an essential role in activation of IKK and NF-κB induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a pharmacological homolog of diacylglycerol, in mature T cells (10Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lin X. O'Mahony A. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell.

Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which PKCθ activates IKK remains to be determined. CARMA1 (also known as CARD11) is a scaffold molecule containing an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain, a coiled-coil domain, a PDZ domain, an SH3 (Src homology-3) domain, and a C-terminal GUK (guanylate kinase-like) domain (13Bertin J. Wang L. Guo Y. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Merriam S. DiStefano P.S. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11877-11882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). PDZ-SH3-GUK is a signature motif of MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like) proteins that play important roles in regulation of the interface between membrane components and cytoskeletal proteins (14Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryant P.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Consistent with the functions of MAGUK family proteins, CARMA1 is constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and is recruited into the immunological synapse following CD3/CD28 costimulation (15Gaide O.

Recent studies also indicate that CARMA1 links PKCθ to downstream signaling components leading to activation of NF-κB (15Gaide O. Favier B. Legler D.F. Bonnet D. Brissoni B. Valitutti S. Bron C.

More recently, our studies suggested that PKCθ is recruited into the immunological synapse through an interaction with CARMA1 (22Wang D. Matsumoto R. You Y. Che T. Lin X. Gaffen S. Lin X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Following CD3/CD28 costimulation, CARMA1 also recruits Bcl10, an adaptor protein, into the immunological synapse (15Gaide O.

Besides its interaction with CARMA1, Bcl10 also binds to MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue protein-1, also known as paracaspase) (30Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A. Pisabarro M.T.

MALT1 contains an N-terminal death domain, followed by two Ig-like domains and a C-terminal caspase-like domain. Chromosomal translocation of the MALT1 gene to the genomic locus of the cIAP gene has been linked to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas (30Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A.

Importantly, overexpression of cIAP-MALT1 fusion proteins derived from MALT lymphoma patients potently activates NF-κB, suggesting that MALT1 may be involved in regulation of IKK activation. Therefore, it has been proposed that Bcl10 may induce oligomerization of MALT1 through binding to the Ig-like domains of MALT1, leading to activation of the IKK complex (30Uren A.G. O'Rourke K.

Stable expression of a deletion mutant of MALT1 completely abolished CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-κB activation.

Jurkat T cells expressing mutant MALT1(N-Term), encoding residues 1–332, or mutant MALT1(C-Term), encoding residues 333–824, were established by stably transfecting plasmids encoding these constructs using the Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 250 V and 950 microfarads with 20 μg of plasmid DNA. Jurkat cells expressing MALT1 deletion mutants were selected in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 μg/ml G418.

Plasmids and Antibodies—Plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged MALT1 and its mutants were generated by PCRs using the original cDNAs (30Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S.

Plasmids for the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay were generated by inserting sequence encoding CARMA1 deletion mutants downstream of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pGBK-T7 vector (Clontech) and subcloning the caspase-like domain (residues 333–824) of MALT1 downstream of the Gal4 activation domain in the pGAD-T7 vector (Clontech). Monoclonal antibodies against both the N and C termini of MALT1 were generated in the Genentech central production facility. Antibodies against PKCθ (clone 27) and LAT were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), and antibodies against Bcl10 (H197), Lck, and the FLAG epitope tag were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were mixed with 1 ml of 80% sucrose in MNE buffer and transferred to a Beckman ultracentrifuge tube. Next, 2 ml of 30% sucrose followed by 1 ml of 5% sucrose in MNE buffer were overlaid. Samples were centrifuged in an STi-55 rotor at 200,000 × g for 20 h. Fractions (400 μl/fraction) were collected from the top of the gradient. Proteins from each fraction were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid before separation by 10% SDS-PAGE. Co-immunoprecipitation—Myc-tagged CARMA1 was transfected into HEK293 cells expressing different versions of MALT1 by calcium phosphate precipitation. Twenty hours later, MALT1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody M2 affinity gel (Sigma). Samples were washed four times with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluted samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To examine whether MALT1 is involved in TCR signal transduction, we examined whether CD3/CD28 costimulation induces MALT1 translocation to lipid rafts. The detergent-insoluble membrane (lipid raft) fractions of Jurkat T cells were prepared by centrifugation of cellular components in a discontinuous sucrose gradient. The recruitment of signaling components (Bcl10 and Lck) into lipid rafts was examined by Western blotting of individual fractions of the sucrose gradient (Fig. 1A). To determine whether MALT1 was present in the lipid raft fractions, we combined the sucrose gradient fractions that contained lipid rafts (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–5) and then immunoprecipitated MALT1 from the pooled fractions. We found that a small portion of MALT1 was present in the lipid raft fractions in Jurkat T cells following CD3/CD28 costimulation (Fig. 1B), suggesting that MALT1 may be a signaling component in the TCR signal transduction pathway. To determine the molecular mechanism of CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced recruitment of MALT1 into lipid rafts, we stimulated Jurkat T cells or CARMA1-deficient Jurkat T cells (JPM50.6) (16Wang D. You Y. Case S.M. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Wang L. DiStefano P.S. Nunez G. Bertin J. Lin X. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 830-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for different time points. The recruitment of MALT1 and other components in these cells was also detected by Western blotting. CD3/CD28 costimulation rapidly recruited MALT1 into lipid rafts, and this recruitment was diminished within 20 min (Fig. 2A). The recruitment of MALT1 into the lipid rafts appears to be dependent on CARMA1 because CD3/CD28 costimulation failed to induce the recruitment of MALT1 into lipid rafts in JPM50.6 cells (Fig. 2A). Similarly, Bcl10 and PKCθ translocation to lipid rafts induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation was defective in JPM50.6 cells (Fig. 2A), as described previously (22Wang D. Matsumoto R. You Y. Che T. Lin X. Gaffen S. Lin X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Chromosomal translocation of the MALT1 gene to the genomic locus of the cIAP gene was found to cause expression of a cIAP-MALT1 fusion protein in a MALT lymphoma patient. Expression of this cIAP-MALT1 fusion protein (also known as paracaspase-Case2) potently activates NF-κB (30Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol.

To determine whether MALT1 functions downstream of CARMA1, we expressed cIAP-MALT1 in JPM50.6 cells to test whether cIAP-MALT1-induced NF-κB activation is dependent on CARMA1. Consistent with the above results, expression of cIAP-MALT1 effectively activated NF-κB in JPM50.6 cells (Fig. 2B), whereas PKCθ(AE), a constitutively active version of PKCθ that functions upstream of CARMA1 (16Wang D. You Y. Case S.M. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Wang L. DiStefano P.S. Nunez G. Bertin J. Lin X. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 830-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), failed to do so (Fig. 2B). Together, these results indicate that MALT1 is a signaling component downstream of CARMA1 in the TCR signal transduction pathway. It has been shown that MALT1 associates with Bcl10 through its N-terminal domain (31Lucas P.C. Yonezumi M. Inohara N. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Abazeed M.E. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Seto M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19012-19019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of MALT1 in the TCR signal transduction pathway, we stably transfected constructs encoding various MALT1 mutants into Jurkat T cells. These included a mutant consisting of N-terminal residues 1–332 (MALT1(N-Term)), which contain the N-terminal death domain and the Ig-like domains, and a mutant consisting of C-terminal residues 333–824 (MALT1(C-Term)), which contain the caspase-like domain (Fig. 3A). Activation of NF-κB in these cells was examined following various stimuli. Although the expression levels of transfected MALT1(N-Term) and endogenous MALT1 were comparable in the cells stably expressing MALT1(N-Term) (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–6), both CD3/CD28 costimulation and PMA/CD28 costimulation failed to induce NF-κB activation in the cells expressing MALT1(N-Term) (Fig. 3C), whereas TNF-α effectively induced NF-κB activation. The inhibitory effect caused by expression of MALT1(N-Term) is specific to the NF-κB pathway because CD3/CD28 costimulation effectively induced AP-1 activation in these cells (Fig. 3D). In contrast, expression of MALT1(C-Term), whose level was comparable with the expression level of MALT1(N-Term) (Fig. 3B, lanes 7–10), had no inhibitory effects on NF-κB activation (Fig. 3C). Instead, expression of MALT1(C-Term) appeared to enhance NF-κB activation. This finding suggests that MALT1 is specifically involved in TCR-induced NF-κB activation. To determine which level of the TCR signaling cascade is blocked in Jurkat T cells expressing MALT1(N-Term), we examined CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced IKK activation. We found that CD3/CD28 or PMA/CD28 costimulation, but not TNF-α, failed to activate IKK in the MALT1(N-Term) cells (Fig. 4A), whereas expression of MALT1(C-Term) in Jurkat T cells had no inhibitory effects on CD3/CD28 or PMA/CD28 costimulation-induced IKK activation (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and JNK induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation was intact in the MALT1(N-Term) cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Together, these results indicate that expression of MALT1(N-Term) specifically inhibits a signaling event upstream of the IKK complex in the TCR signaling pathway. To further demonstrate that MALT1 is a downstream component of CARMA1, we determined CARMA1-induced NF-κB activation by overexpressing CARMA1 either in Jurkat T cells or in the cells expressing MALT1(N-Term). Expression of CARMA1 effectively activated NF-κB in Jurkat T cells, whereas activation of NF-κB was partially blocked in the cells expressing MALT1(N-Term) (Fig. 5). This result is consistent with the above data (Fig. 2), indicating that MALT1 is a down-stream component of CARMA1 in the TCR signaling pathway. To determine whether expression of MALT1(N-Term) in Jurkat T cells affects the recruitment of endogenous MALT1 into the lipid rafts following CD3/CD28 costimulation, the lipid raft fractions were prepared from Jurkat T cells or the cells expressing MALT1(N-Term) with or without CD3/CD28 costimulation. The endogenous MALT1 proteins were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against the C terminus of MALT1. We found that the endogenous MALT1 proteins were effectively recruited into the lipid rafts in Jurkat T cells as well as in the cells expressing MALT1(N-Term) following CD3/CD28 costimulation (Fig. 6). Previous studies indicate that CARMA1 associates with Bcl10. Since the N-terminal domain of MALT1 was shown to associate with Bcl10 (31Lucas P.C. Yonezumi M. Inohara N. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Abazeed M.E. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Seto M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19012-19019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), we examined the molecular basis by which MALT1 associates with the Bcl10-CARMA1 complex. We stably transfected HEK293 cells with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged MALT1, MALT1(N-Term), or MALT1(C-Term). These cells were then transiently transfected with or without Myc-tagged CARMA1 (Fig. 7B). The complex formation of transfected MALT1 and CARMA1 with Bcl10 was examined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Specifically, FLAG-tagged MALT1 or its deletion mutants were first immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads. The proteins associated with the immunoprecipitation complexes were then detected by immunoblot analysis. Consistent with previous studies, both MALT1 and MALT1(N-Term) associated with endogenous Bcl10 (Fig. 7A, lanes 3–6), whereas MALT1(C-Term) failed to form a complex with Bcl10 (lanes 7 and 8). These result confirm that the N-terminal domain of MALT1 (residues 1–332) associates with Bcl10. Interestingly, both MALT1 and MALT1(C-Term) associated with CARMA1 (Fig. 7A, upper panel, lanes 4 and 8), and this interaction is apparently independent of Bcl10 because MALT1(C-Term) could not associate with Bcl10 (middle panel, lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that the caspase-like domain of MALT1 may directly associate with CARMA1. To further demonstrate that the caspase-like domain of MALT1 can directly interact with CARMA1, we use the yeast two-hybrid interaction system to confirm this interaction. We found that the C-terminal caspase-like domain (residues 333–824) of MALT1 is specifically associated with the coiled-coil domain of CARMA1 in the yeast two-hybrid interaction system (Fig. 8). The coiled-coil domain of CARMA1 has been shown to be required for TCR-induced NF-κB activation (17Pomerantz J.L. Denny E.M. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5184-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The association of the coiled-coil domain of CARMA1 with MALT1 may provide the molecular mechanism by which CARMA1 regulates its downstream signaling components. Together, these results indicate that MALT1 forms a trimolecular complex with Bcl10 and CARMA1 in the TCR signal transduction pathway (Fig. 9).Fig. 9Working model of TCR-induced NF-κB activation through the CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex.MHC, major histocompatibility complex; APC, antigen-presenting cell; C-C, coiled-coil domain; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; S/T, Ser/Thr-rich domain; DD, death domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MALT1/paracaspase is a protein that contains an N-terminal death domain, two Ig-like domains, and a C-terminal caspase-like domain. A fusion protein of cIAP-MALT1 resulting from a chromosomal translocation of the MALT1 gene to the genomic locus of the cIAP gene is associated with MALT lymphoma. Overexpression of the oncogenic cIAP-MALT1 fusion protein potently activated NF-κB, suggesting that cIAP-MALT1 may constitutively induce NF-κB activation and contribute to the malignancy of MALT lymphoma. However, the functions of MALT1 in normal cellular signaling pathways have not been defined. Previous studies show that MALT1 is physically associated with Bcl10, suggesting that MALT1 is involved in the Bcl10-dependent signaling pathway such as antigen receptor signaling in lymphocytes. In this study, we demonstrated that MALT1 is translocated to the lipid raft fractions following CD3/CD28 costimulation. This result indicates that MALT1 is a signaling component in the TCR signaling pathway. In agreement with recent gene targeting experiments (32Ruefli-Brasse A.A. French D.M. Dixit V.M. Science. 2003; 302: 1581-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 33Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Wakeham A. Mak T.W. Immunity. 2003; 19: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), we found that the stable expression of a deletion mutant of MALT1 in Jurkat T cells completely blocked CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-κB activation, indicating that MALT1 indeed plays a critical role in mediating TCR-induced NF-κB activation. Emerging evidence indicates that multiple signaling components are recruited into lipid rafts following stimulation of the TCR complex. Our data indicate that a portion of MALT1 is also recruited into lipid rafts. This recruitment is apparently dependent on CARMA1, an essential scaffold molecule for TCR-induced NF-κB activation. This result is consistent with the previously proposed model that MALT1 is downstream of CARMA1 in the TCR signaling pathway. However, we also found that MALT1 forms a complex with CARMA1 in a Bcl10-independent manner. This finding is different from the proposed model, in which CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 is in a linear arrangement in a signaling pathway (35McAllister-Lucas L. Inohara N. Lucas P. Ruland J. Benito A. Li Q. Chen S. Chen F. Yamaoka S. Verma I. Mak T. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30589-30597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our results suggest a working model that CARMA1, MALT1, and Bcl10 may form a trimolecular complex following CD3/CD28 costimulation (Fig. 9). Therefore, CARMA1 may directly recruit MALT1 into lipid rafts, where CARMA1 either induces MALT1 activity or bridges MALT1 and its substrates. In this model, Bcl10 and MALT1 may cooperate to regulate the downstream IKK activity. Although MALT1 contains a caspase-like domain, it remains to be determined whether MALT1 functions as a caspase-like enzyme or has other enzymatic activities. Of note, a mutant version of MALT1 in which a conserved Cys residue that is critical for caspase activity is mutated to Ala exhibited no inhibitory effects on CD3/CD28 costimulation-induced NF-κB activation (data not shown), suggesting that caspase-like activity may not be important for MALT1 function. Therefore, revealing the biological function of MALT1 will provide the mechanism by which MALT1 activates the downstream IKK complex. In summary, we have demonstrated that MALT1 is an important signaling component downstream of CARMA1 and is recruited into lipid rafts of the immunological synapse following CD3/CD28 costimulation. MALT1 forms a trimolecular complex with CARMA1 and Bcl10 to mediate TCR-induced IKK activation, leading to activation of NF-κB. These observations are consistent with previous studies showing that Bcl10 and CARMA1 are specifically involved in TCR-induced NF-κB activation. Therefore, the next exciting task is to determine how MALT1 induces IKK activation. We thank S. L. Gaffen for critical reading of and comments on the manuscript."

A genomewide search showed that E. histolytica apparently possesses a simplified and non-redundant NIF (nitrogen fixation)-like system for the Fe-S cluster formation, composed of only a catalytic component, NifS, and a scaffold component, NifU. Amino acid alignment and phylogenetic analyses revealed that both amebic NifS and NifU (EhNifS and EhNifU, respectively) showed a close kinship to orthologs from ϵ-proteobacteria, suggesting that both of these genes were likely transferred by lateral gene transfer from an ancestor of ϵ-proteobacteria to E. histolytica. The EhNifS protein expressed in E. coli was present as a homodimer, showing cysteine desulfurase activity with a very basic optimum pH compared with NifS from other organisms. Eh-NifU protein existed as a tetramer and contained one stable [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster per monomer, revealed by spectroscopic and iron analyses. Fractionation of the whole parasite lysate by anion exchange chromatography revealed three major cysteine desulfurase activities, one of which corresponded to the EhNifS protein, verified by immunoblot analysis using the specific EhNifS antibody; the other two peaks corresponded to methionine γ-lyase and cysteine synthase. Finally, ectopic expression of the EhNifS and EhNifU genes successfully complemented, under anaerobic but not aerobic conditions, the growth defect of an Escherichia coli strain, in which both the isc and suf operons were deleted, suggesting that EhNifS and EhNifU are necessary and sufficient for Fe-S clusters of non-nitrogenase Fe-S proteins to form under anaerobic conditions.

Recent studies using genetic and biochemical methods have unveiled the complex mechanism of the assembly in vitro and in vivo (2Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

These studies led to the identification of three distinct systems, namely nitrogen fixation (NIF), iron-sulfur cluster (ISC), and mobilization of sulfur (SUF). Two to six components have been shown to participate in the formation of Fe-S clusters, depending upon the system. For instance, in the NIF system, two genes (nifS and nifU) and their encoded proteins have been shown to be involved in the assembly of Fe-S clusters of the nitrogenase proteins in Azotobacter vinelandii (2Zheng L.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). NifS is a homodimer of two identical subunits of a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent cysteine desulfurase, which catalyzes the formation of l-alanine and elemental sulfur from l-cysteine. The catalysis is initiated by the formation of a Schiff base between the amino group of cysteine and PLP cofactor (3Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and nucleophilic attack of the reactive cysteine by a conserved histidine residue near the active site (9Kaiser J.T. Clausen T. Bourenkow G.P. Bartunik H.D. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which in turn mobilizes elemental sulfur. NifU is a scaffold protein for the transient assembly of Fe-S clusters, which are transferred to target apoproteins (10Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The NifU protein possesses two distinct types of iron-binding sites (10Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). One of these binding sites, located in the central third of the NifU protein, binds a stable permanent [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster per subunit as shown in A. vinelandii (11Fu W. Jack R.F. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13455-13463Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The second type of site, located within the amino-terminal third of the NifU protein, binds a labile mononuclear iron and/or labile cluster (11Fu W. Jack R.F. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13455-13463Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the cluster-ligated cysteine residues of NifU from A. vinelandii has shown that the permanent [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters play an essential role in the maturation of nitrogenase (12Agar J.N.

The NIF system has been identified in only nitrogen-fixing bacteria and non-diazotrophic ϵ-proteobacteria including Campylobacter jejuni and Helicobacter pylori, and appears to be involved in Fe-S assembly of the nitrogenase proteins in bacteria that belong to the former group and of non-nitrogenase Fe-S proteins in the latter (13Olson J.W. Agar J.N. Johnson M.K. Maier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16213-16219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast to the NIF system, the ISC system is well conserved from bacteria to a wide range of eukaryotes including Saccharomyces, Arabidopsis, Caenorhabditis, Drosophila, and Homo, and thus, assumed to play more general housekeeping roles for Fe-S cluster assembly. The components of the ISC system are more complex than those of the NIF system: at least six proteins, encoded in a single operon (isc-SUA-hscBA-fdx) in prokaryotes, e.g. Escherichia coli, are involved in the process (4Zheng L.

The SUF system, a third bacterial system for the assembly of Fe-S clusters, is encoded in the suf operon (sufABCDSE) and widely present in Eubacteria, Archaea, and plastids (8Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Disruption of the E. coli suf operon alone did not cause any major defect, whereas lethality was observed when both the isc and suf operons were inactivated (8Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the SUF system plays a role for Fe-S cluster assembly and/or repair under oxidative stress conditions (21Nachin L. EL Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and iron starvation (23Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181 (3307): 3307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the SUF system has been shown to be necessary for virulence of Gram-negative bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi, causing soft-rot disease in plants (21Nachin L. EL Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition to the catalytic component SufS, the SUF system requires at least five additional proteins including SufA, a scaffold component, SufC, an unorthodox ATPase of the ABC superfamily, SufB and SufD, which are associated with SufC (24Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and SufE, which interacts with SufS and stimulates its cysteine desulfurase activity (25Loiseau L. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Nachin L. Fontecave M. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38352-38359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that a mitochondrial IscS homolog in yeasts (Nfs1) is involved in Fe-S assembly of aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase and thus is essential for mitochondrial function (26Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). IscS homologs are produced in the cytosol and transported to mitochondria (27Nakai Y. Yoshihara Y. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the nucleus in yeasts and mammals (28Schilke B. Voisine C. Beinert H. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10206-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 29Tong W.H. Jameson G.N.L. Huynh B.H. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9762-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). An independent study also revealed that mitochondria play a crucial role in the cluster formation of extramitochondrial Fe-S proteins (30Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Thus, the assembly of Fe-S clusters is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes and apparently occurs in mitochondria, cytoplasm, and nucleus, suggesting organelle-specific Fe-S cluster assembly in eukaryotes (31Tong W.H. Rouault T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 32Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence or absence, i.e. ubiquity and specificity, of these three distinct systems for Fe-S assembly among organisms, together with their specific function in each organism, remains largely unknown, especially in parasitic protozoa. IscS has been demonstrated in an aerobic protozoan parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (33Ellis K.E.S. Clough B. Saldanha J.W. Wilson R.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and two anaerobic protozoa, Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis (34Tachezy J. Sanchez L.B. Muller M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 1919-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The latter two parasites belong, together with another enteric parasitic protist Entamoeba histolytica, to a group of amitochondrial eukaryotes. Amitochondrial eukaryotes can be divided into two metabolic types (35Martin W. Muller M. Nature. 1998; 392: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Type I organisms including G. lamblia and Entamoeba lack organelles involved in core energy metabolism. Instead, Fe-S protein (i.e. pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase)-mediated metabolism of pyruvate, substrate-level phosphorylation, and ATP synthesis takes place in the cytosol. In contrast, type II organisms including Trichomonas, some ciliates, and chytrid fungi harbor a double-membrane limited organelle, hydrogenosome, which represents a site of the abovementioned core energy metabolism. The fact that the scaffold component IscU is also present in Trichomonas and Giardia (36Tovar J. Leon-Avila G. Sanchez L.B. Sutak R. Tachezy J. Van Der Giezen M. Hernandez M. Muller M. Lucocq J.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) supported the premise that the machinery for Fe-S cluster assembly in these amitochondrial anaerobic protists shares common features with the ISC system in other organisms. In contrast, the machinery for the Fe-S cluster assembly in E. histolytica is largely unknown. The present study demonstrates that E. histolytica possesses the NIF-like system as a sole pathway for the biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters. We describe here for the first time the molecular identification of NifS and NifU from E. histolytica and provide evidence for the possible horizontal transfer of these genes from an ancestor of ϵ-proteobacteria. We also show biochemical properties distinct from those of other organisms including bacteria and mammals. In addition, we demonstrate that the amebic NifS and NifU are necessary and sufficient for the Fe-S cluster formation under anaerobic conditions by heterologous complementation of an isc/suf-lacking mutant of E. coli. Chemicals and Reagents—All chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Wako (Tokyo, Japan) unless stated otherwise. l-cysteine, l-cystine, O-acetyl serine, N-acetyl cysteine, dl-homocysteine, d-cysteine, sodium sulfide, O-phenanthroline, hydroxylamine, N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate, ferrous ammonium sulfate, PLP, 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, HEPES, N-[tris(hydroxymethyl-)methyl]-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propane-sulfonic acid, ampicillin, and carbenicillin disodium salt were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Microorganisms and Cultivation—Trophozoites of E. histolytica strain HM-1:IMSS cl-6 (37Diamond L.S. Mattern C.F. Bartgis I.L. J. Virol. 1972; 9: 326-341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained axenically in Diamond's BI-S-33 medium (38Diamond L.S. Harlow D.R. Cunnick C.C. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1978; 72: 431-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar) at 35.5 °C. Trophozoites were harvested in the late-logarithmic growth phase 2-3 days after inoculation of 1/12 to 1/6 of the total culture volume and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. E. coli strains BL21 (DE3) and DH5α were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI) and Invitrogen, respectively. Search of the E. histolytica Genome Database—The E. histolytica genome databases (contigs and singletons) at The Institute for Genomic Research 2Internet address: www.tigr.org/tdb/. and Sanger Institute 3Internet address: www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/E_histolytica/. were searched using the TBLASTN algorithm with protein sequences corresponding to the catalytic component of Fe-S cluster formation (NifS, IscS, and SufS) from a variety of species. We also searched for homologs of the Nif- or Isc-specific scaffold component (NifU or IscU, respectively) from A. vinelandii and H. pylori and components shared by both the Isc and Suf systems (IscA and SufA) of E. coli, A. vinelandii, and P. falciparum, or components unique to the Suf system (SufB, C, D, and E) from E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Methanococcus jannashii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and P. falciparum. Amino Acid Alignments and Phylogenetic Analysis—The sequences of NifS, IscS, NifU, IscU, and related proteins showing similarity in amino acid sequence to EhNifS and EhNifU were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information 4Internet address: www.ncbi.nih.gov/. using the BLASTP search. Alignment and phylogenetic analysis were performed with CLUSTAL W version 1.81 (39Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55399) Google Scholar) using the neighbor-joining method with the Blosum matrix. A rooted or an unrooted neighbor-joining tree composed of the amino acid sequences of 25 NifS/IscS or 20 NifU/IscU from various organisms was constructed using 352 or 120 shared amino acid positions, respectively, after removing gaps. The most distal members of NifS/IscS that belong to group II including E. coli cysteine sulfinate desulfinase (CsdA) and SufS (also known as CsdB or selenocysteine lyase) were used as the out-group to obtain a rooted tree. Trees were drawn by Tree ViewPPC ver.1.6.6 (40Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Branch lengths and bootstrap values (1000 replicates) were derived from the neighbor-joining analysis. Cloning of E. histolytica NifS and NifU—On the basis of the nucleotide sequences of the protein-encoding region of the putative amebic nifS and nifU genes (EhNifS and EhNifU) in the genome database, two sets of primers, shown below, were designed to amplify the open reading frames (ORFs) using a cDNA library (41Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) as a template to construct plasmids to produce EhNifS and EhNifU fusion proteins with a histidine tag or glutathione S-transferase at the amino terminus, respectively. The EhNifS ORF was amplified with a sense (5′-CCTGGATCCGATGCAAAGTACAAAATCAGT-3′) and an antisense (5′-CCAGGATCCTTAAGCATATGTTGATGATAATTGTC-3′) primer, where BamHI sites are underlined and the translation initiation and termination codons are italicized. The initial step, denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min with platinum pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), was followed by the 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 68 °C for 2 min, and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C. The ∼1.2-kb PCR fragment was digested with BamHI, electrophoresed, purified with Geneclean kit II (BIO 101, Vista, CA), and cloned into BamHI-digested pET-15b (Novagen) in the same orientation as the T7 promoter. The EhNifU ORF was amplified using a sense (5′-ATGTCAAAGAATAAATTAATTGGTGGAGC-3′) and an antisense (5′-CTAATCTTTCTTTTTGATATTTAAGGT-3′) primer from a cDNA library (the translation initiation and termination sites are italicized). A PCR fragment containing EhNifU was end-blunted and cloned into the EcoRI-digested and end-filled site of pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences). The final constructs were designated pHisEhNifS and pGSTEhNifU, respectively. Expression and Purification of Recombinant EhNifS and EhNifU Proteins—To express the recombinant proteins in E. coli, pHisEhNifS or pGSTEhNifU was introduced into BL21 (DE3) or DH5α cells, respectively. Expression of the recombinant EhNifS (rEhNifS) and EhNifU (rEhNifU) fusion proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside at 30 °C for 5-6 h. The rEhNifS and EhNifU fusion proteins were purified using a Ni2+-NTA column (Novagen) or glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions with a few modifications. The bacterial cells were washed, sonicated in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 100 μg/ml of lysozyme, and Complete Mini EDTA free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Tokyo, Japan), and centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The histidine-tagged rEhNifS protein was eluted from the Ni2+-NTA column with 100 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) and extensively dialyzed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl (pH 8.0), and 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) containing 10% glycerol (v/v) and the protease inhibitors. To obtain the rEhNifU, bacterial cells were lysed in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml of lysozyme. After the GSTEhNifU fusion protein was bound to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, the rEhNifU was obtained by digestion of GST-EhNifU fusion proteins with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) in the column or outside of the column, followed by elution from the column. Thrombin was removed by passing through a HiTrap-benzamidine column (Amersham Biosciences), and rEhNifU was extensively dialyzed at 4 °C with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm DTT. The purified rEhNifS and rEhNifU proteins were presumed to contain additional 25 (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLEDP) or 5 (GSPGI) amino acids at the amino terminus, respectively. The purified enzymes were stored at - 80 °C with 50% glycerol before use. No decrease in the enzyme activity of rEhNifS was observed under these conditions for at least 3 months. Protein concentrations were determined with the Coomassie Brilliant Blue assay (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Enzyme Assays—For the cysteine desulfurase assay, rEhNifS protein was reconstituted with PLP by incubating 1 mg/ml of EhNifS with 0.1 mm PLP for 1 h on ice, followed by dialysis for 5-6 h against 100-200-fold volumes of 50 mmN-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid/NaOH (pH 9.0) with two buffer exchanges, as described previously for the Synechocystis enzyme (42Jaschkowitz K. Seidler A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3416-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cysteine desulfurase activity of EhNifS was monitored based on the production of sulfide using l-cysteine as the substrate (43Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The standard EhNifS reaction was performed in 200 μl of reaction mixture (50 mm 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid/NaOH buffer (pH 10.0) containing 0.02 mm PLP, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm substrate (l-cysteine), and appropriate amounts (25-50 μg) of purified EhNifS protein). In experiments to determine pH optima, the following buffers were used: 50 mm 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid/NaOH for pH 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5; HEPES/NaOH for pH 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0; N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid/NaOH for pH 8.5 and 9.0; and 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid for pH 9.7, 10.0, 10.5, and 11.0. The reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of 20 mmN,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate in 7.2 n HCl and 20 μl of 30 mm FeCl3 in 1.2 n HCl. After further incubation in the dark for 30 min, the protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and then the absorption at 670 nm (A670) of the supernatant was measured. Na2S (0-100 μm) was used as the standard. Elemental sulfur (S0) was measured by the cyanolysis method (2Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 44Wood J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The alanine production was monitored by measuring pyruvate formed by deamination of alanine using l-alanine aminotransferase in a coupling reaction as described previously (2Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The rEhNifS protein was stable in the presence of 10% glycerol, and 90-95% of the initial activity was retained when stored at 4 or - 20 °C for 24 h. However, it was reduced to 25-35% when stored without any additive at room temperature, 4, or - 20 °C for 24 h. Iron Assay—The iron content of EhNifU was determined by the O-phenanthroline method as described, except that the volume of the reaction mixture was reduced (13Olson J.W. Agar J.N. Johnson M.K. Maier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16213-16219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The EhNifU samples were acidified by the addition of 3-5 μl of concentrated HCl and then diluted with buffer or distilled water to 0.2 ml. The mixtures were heated to 80 °C for 10 min and cooled down to room temperature; then 0.6 ml of water, 40 μl of 10% hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and 0.2 ml of 0.1% O-phenanthroline were added. The mixtures were further incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and then absorbance at 512 nm (A512) was measured with 0-100 μm of ferrous ammonium sulfate as the standard. Anion-Exchange Chromatography of the Native and Recombinant EhNifS—Approximately 2 × 107E. histolytica trophozoites (250-300 mg) was resuspended in 1.0 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.0 mm EDTA, 2.0 mm DTT, and 15% glycerol containing 10 μg/ml of trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane and t"

Activation of NFκB requires the activity of IκB kinase, a kinase complex that contains two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a non-enzymatic regulatory subunit, IKKγ. To understand how NFκB activation is regulated at the IKKγ level, we searched for IKKγ-interacting proteins by the yeast two-hybrid system. This search identified ZNF216, a zinc finger protein with unknown biological functions. ZNF216 contains an A20-like zinc finger domain (ZnF-A20) at its N terminus and an AN1-like domain (ZnF-AN1) at its C terminus. Similar to A20, ZNF216 interacted with IKKγ, RIP, and TRAF6 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Domain mapping experiments indicated that the ZnF-A20 domain was responsible for interacting with IKKγ and RIP, whereas the ZnF-AN1 domain interacted with TRAF6. ZNF216 inhibited NFκB activation triggered by overexpression of RIP and TRAF6 but not of p65. ZNF216 also inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin-1-, and Toll-like receptor 4-induced NFκB activation in a dose-dependent manner. The ZnF-A20 domain was essential for ZNF216-mediated inhibition of NFκB activation. The ZnF-A20 and ZnF-AN1 domains of ZNF216 could interact with each other, whereas ZNF216 could form homo-oligomers or hetero-oligomers with A20. Unlike A20, which inhibits TNF-induced apoptosis, overexpression of ZNF216 sensitized cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. Our findings suggest that ZNF216 and A20 have redundant and distinct roles in regulating NFκB activation and apoptosis.

For example, NFκB plays critical roles in immune regulation and inflammation through induction of a large set of downstream genes, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and effectors (1Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4045) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin A.S. J. Clin.

Recent studies suggest that NFκB also is critically involved in the regulation of cell death and survival through the transcriptional activation of genes important for anti-apoptosis and cell proliferation, such as Casper/c-FLIP, c-IAPs, TRAF1, TRAF2, Bfl-1/A1, Bcl-Xl, Fas ligand, c-myc, and cyclin D1 (1Karin M.

The major cellular form of NFκB is a heterodimer consisting of the DNA binding subunit p50 and the transactivator p65. Normally, NFκB is retained in the cytoplasm through association with its inhibitor IκB. Upon stimulation by various NFκB activating signals, IκB is phosphorylated and degraded through a ubiquitin-dependent process. This process frees NFκB, which is then translocated into the nucleus to activate transcription of downstream genes (1Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev.

It has been proposed that IKKγ is responsible for connecting IKK to upstream signaling components in various NFκB activation pathways (1Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev.

A20 was originally identified as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-responsive gene in human endothelial cells (16Opipari Jr., A.W. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14705-14708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A20 contains seven novel zinc finger motifs with characteristics of CX2-4CX11CX2C at its C-terminal domain (16Opipari Jr., A.W. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Gene knock-out studies have demonstrated that A20 is a suppressor of inflammation through attenuating TNF-induced NFκB activation (21Lee E.G. Boone D.L. Chai S. Libby S.L. Chien M. Lodolce J.P. Ma A. Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). A20 also can inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis, and a recent report suggests that this is mediated through disrupting recruitment of the death domain containing adapter proteins TRADD and RIP to the TNF receptor 1 signaling complex (27He K.L. Ting A.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6034-6045Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).In this report, we identified a novel IKKγ-interacting protein, ZNF216. ZNF216 contains an A20-like zinc finger (ZnFA20) domain at its N terminus and an AN1-like zinc finger (ZnF-AN1) domain at its C terminus. In addition to IKKγ, ZNF216 also interacts with RIP, TRAF6, and A20. Overexpression of ZNF216 inhibits NFκB activation triggered by TNF, IL-1, and Toll-like receptor 4 and sensitizes cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. Our findings suggest that ZNF216 and A20 have redundant and distinct functions in regulating NFκB activation and apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Recombinant TNF, IL-1, and IFN-γ (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), mouse monoclonal antibodies against FLAG (Sigma) and HA (Covance, Berkeley, CA) epitopes, rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IKKγ and RIP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and the human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were purchased from the indicated manufacturers.Constructs—The NFκB (Dr. Gary Johnson, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center) and IRF-1 (Dr. Uli Schindler, Tularik Inc.) luciferase reporter plasmids were provided by the indicated investigators. The mammalian expression plasmids for HA- or FLAG-tagged RIP, IKKβ, IKKγ, TRAF2, TRAF6, and p65 were previously described (23Chen D. Li X. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Wu M. Xu L.G. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27072-27079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The HA- or FLAG-tagged mammalian expression plasmids for ZNF216 and its mutants were constructed by PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNA fragments and subsequently cloning into a cytomegalovirus promoter-based vector containing an N-terminal HA or FLAG tag.Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The cDNA encoding full-length human IKKγ was inserted in-frame into the Gal4 DNA binding domain vector pGBT9 (Clontech). The human leukocyte two-hybrid cDNA library was screened and the isolation of positive clones was performed by following the manufacturer's protocols.Northern Blot Analysis—Human multiple tissue mRNA blots were purchased from Clontech. The blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled ZNF216 cDNA in the rapid hybridization buffer (Clontech) under high stringency conditions.Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Transfection of 293 cells was performed with the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (28Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 293 cells (∼1 × 105) were seeded on 12-well (25 mm) dishes and were transfected the following day. Within the same experiment, each transfection was performed in triplicate, and where necessary, empty control plasmid was added to ensure that each transfection received the same amount of total DNA. To normalize for transfection efficiency, 0.25 μg of PRL-RSV-SV40 plasmid was added to each transfection. Dual specific luciferase reporter assays were performed using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) by following the manufacturer's protocol. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of Renilla luciferase expression levels.Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Transfected 293 cells from each 100-mm dish were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For each immunoprecipitation, a 0.4-ml aliquot of lysate was incubated with 0.5 μg of the indicated monoclonal antibody or control mouse IgG and 25 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Gamma Bind G Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for at least 2 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The precipitates were fractionated on SDS-PAGE, and subsequent Western blot analysis was performed as described (23Chen D. Li X. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Wu M. Xu L.G. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27072-27079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Apoptosis Assays—β-Galactosidase co-transfection assays for determination of cell death were performed as described previously (29Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 104: 487-501Google Scholar, 30Shu H.B. Halpins D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293 cells (∼1 × 105) were seeded on 12-well dishes and transfected the following day by calcium phosphate precipitation with 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid and the indicated testing plasmids. Within the same experiment, each transfection was performed in triplicate, and where necessary, empty control plasmid was added to ensure each transfection received the same amount of DNA. Approximately 14 h after transfection, the cells were treated with TNF (20 ng/ml) or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) or left untreated for 12 h. Cells were then stained with X-gal as described previously (29Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 104: 487-501Google Scholar, 30Shu H.B. Halpins D.R. Goeddel D.V.

The number of survived blue cells from five representative viewing fields was determined microscopically. Data shown are averages and standard deviations of one representative experiment in which each transfection had been performed in triplicate.RESULTSIdentification of ZNF216 as an IKKγ-interacting Protein—To identify IKKγ-interacting proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human leukocyte cell cDNA library with full-length IKKγ as bait. We screened a total of ∼6 × 106 independent clones and obtained 33 β-galactosidase positive clones. Thirteen of these clones encoded ZNF216, a zinc finger protein expressed from human chromosome 9q (31Scott D.A. Greinwald Jr., J.H. Marietta J.R. Drury S. Swiderski R.E. Vinas A. DeAngelis M.M.

Sheffield V.C. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 215: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The biological functions of ZNF216 are unknown.Sequence analysis suggested that ZNF216 was a 213 amino acid protein and contained two zinc finger domains (Fig. 1A). One zinc finger domain, ZnF-A20, was localized at amino acids 11-35 at the N terminus. ZnF-A20 contains a pattern of CX2-4-CX11CX2C that is similar to those found in A20, a zinc finger protein inhibiting TNF-induced NFκB activation and apoptosis (16Opipari Jr., A.W. Boguski M.S.

A. 1996; 93: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Another zinc finger domain, ZnF-AN1, was localized at amino acids 154-193 at the C terminus. ZnF-AN1 contains a pattern of CX2CX9-12CX1-2CX4CX2HX5HXC that is similar to that of AN1, a ubiquitin-like protein in Xenopus laevis (32Linnen J.M. Bailey C.P. Weeks D.L. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The intermediate fragment of ZNF216 had no significant homology with known proteins.Tissue Distribution and Protein Expression of ZNF216— Northern blot analysis suggested that human ZNF216 mRNA was highly expressed in skeletal muscle. It was weakly expressed or undetectable in the brain, heart, colon, thymus, spleen, kidney, liver, small intestine, placenta, lung, and peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 1B).To determine whether ZNF216 was expressed in mammalian cells at the protein level, we raised a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against recombinant full-length ZNF216. Western blot analysis suggested that ZNF216 was expressed as an ∼33-kDa protein in both human rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells and mouse myoblast C2C12 cells (Fig. 1C).ZNF216 Interacted with IKKγ, RIP, and TRAF6 in Mammalian Cells—To determine whether ZNF216 interacts with IKKγ in mammalian cells, we transfected 293 cells with expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged ZNF216 and HA-tagged IKKγ and IKKβ and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These experiments indicated that full-length ZNF216 interacted specifically with IKKγ (Fig. 2A) but not IKKβ (data not shown).Fig. 2ZNF216 interacts with IKKγ, RIP, and TRAF6 but not TRAF2.A, ZNF216 and its ZnF-A20 domain interact with IKKγ. 293 cells (∼2 × 106) were transfected with 3 μg of an expression plasmid for HA-tagged IKKγ, together with 3 μg of an expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged ZNF216 or its mutants, ZNF216-(1-153) or ZNF216-(36-213). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (αF) or control IgG (C), and Western blot analysis was performed with anti-HA antibody. Expression of IKKγ was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the lysate (L) with anti-HA antibody. Expression of ZNF216 and its mutants was comparable as indicated by Western blot analysis of the lysates with anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). B, ectopically expressed ZNF216 interacts with endogenous IKKγ. 293 cells (∼1 × 107) were transfected with 20 μg of an expression plasmid for ZNF216 for 24 h. Cells were lysed, and the lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-ZNF216 antibody or preimmune serum (C). The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blot with anti-IKKγ antibody. C, ZNF216 and its ZnF-A20 domain interact with RIP. The same experiments were performed as in A, except that HA-tagged IKKγ was replaced with HA-tagged RIP. D, ectopically expressed ZNF216 interacts with endogenous RIP. 293 cells (∼1 × 107) were transfected with 20 μg of an expression plasmid for ZNF216 for 24 h. Cells were lysed, and the lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-ZNF216 antibody or preimmune serum (C). The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blot with anti-RIP antibody. E, ZNF216 interacts with TRAF6 but not TRAF2. 293 cells (∼2 × 106) were transfected with 3 μg of an expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged TRAF6 (left panel) or FLAG-tagged TRAF2 (right panel), together with 3 μg of an expression plasmid for HA-tagged ZNF216. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (αF) or control IgG (C), and Western blot analysis was performed with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. Expression of the indicated plasmids was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the lysates (L) with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. F, TRAF6 interacts with the ZnF-AN1 domain of ZNF216. 293 cells (∼2 × 106) were transfected with 3 μg of an expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged TRAF6, together with 3 μg of an expression plasmid for HA-tagged ZNF216-(1-153) or ZNF216-(36-213). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (αF) or control IgG (C), and Western blot analysis was performed with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. Expression of the indicated plasmids was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the lysates (L) with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. The above experiments were repeated three times, and similar results were obtained.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We further examined whether endogenous ZNF216 and IKKγ interact in untransfected cells in the presence or absence of TNF. These experiments failed to detect their interaction (data not shown). One explanation is that our polyclonal anti-ZNF216 antibody is not potent enough for this type of experiment, which requires high quality antibodies. Then we examined whether ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged ZNF216 could interact with endogenous IKKγ. The results indicated that ectopically expressed ZNF216 could interact with endogenous IKKγ in 293 cells (Fig. 2B) and that this interaction was not affected by TNF stimulation (data not shown). In these experiments, IKKγ was shown as two bands around 48 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports (8Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 11Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirt H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar).To determine which domain is responsible for the interaction of ZNF216 with IKKγ, we made ZNF216 deletion mutants containing either ZnF-A20 (amino acids 1-153) or ZnF-AN1 (amino acids 36-213) and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The results indicated that ZnF-A20 but not ZnF-AN1 was required for the interaction of ZNF216 with IKKγ (Fig. 2A).It has been reported that A20 interacts with RIP in the TNF-R1 complex and TRAF6 in the Toll-interleukin-1 receptor signaling complexes. Because ZNF216 contains an A20-like zinc finger domain, we determined whether ZNF216 can also interact with RIP and TRAF6. To test this possibility, we transfected 293 cells with an expression plasmid for ZNF216 together with an expression plasmid for RIP, TRAF6, or TRAF2. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that ZNF216 interacted with RIP (Fig. 2C) and TRAF6 (Fig. 2E) but not TRAF2 (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, ectopically expressed ZNF216 interacted with endogenous RIP in 293 cells (Fig. 2D). Domain mapping experiments further indicated that ZnF-A20 was required for the interaction of ZNF216 with RIP (Fig. 2C), whereas ZnF-AN1 was required for the interaction of ZNF216 with TRAF6 (Fig. 2F).ZNF216 Inhibited RIP- and TRAF6-"

The ACE protein is composed of two homologous domains, each binding zinc and each independently catalytic. To assess the physiologic significance of the two ACE catalytic domains, we used gene targeting in mice to introduce two point mutations (H395K and H399K) that selectively inactivated the ACE N-terminal catalytic site. This modification does not affect C-terminal enzymatic activity or ACE protein expression. In addition, the testis ACE isozyme is not affected by the mutations. Analysis of homozygous mutant mice (termed ACE 7/7) showed normal plasma levels of angiotensin II but an elevation of plasma and urine N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro, a peptide suggested to inhibit bone marrow maturation. Despite this, ACE 7/7 mice had blood pressure, renal function, and hematocrit that were indistinguishable from wild-type mice. We also studied compound heterozygous mice in which one ACE allele was null (no ACE expression) and the second allele encoded the mutations selectively inactivating the N-terminal catalytic domain. These mice produced approximately half the normal levels of ACE, with the ACE protein lacking N-terminal catalytic activity. Despite this, the mice have a phenotype indistinguishable from wild-type animals. This study shows that, in vivo, the presence of the C-terminal ACE catalytic domain is sufficient to maintain a functional renin-angiotensin system. It also strongly suggests that the anemia present in ACE null mice is not due to the accumulation of the peptide N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro.

It also strongly suggests that the anemia present in ACE null mice is not due to the accumulation of the peptide N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro. The major role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) 1The abbreviations and trivial terms used are: RAS, renin-angiotensin system; ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; AcSDKP, N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro; wt, wild-type; ES cells, embryonic stem cells. is the regulation of electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure in mammals. The major effector peptide of the RAS is the octapeptide angiotensin II, which raises blood pressure through a variety of mechanisms, including vasoconstriction and the control of aldosterone release. Angiotensin II is the product of two successive enzymatic cleavages of angiotensinogen. First, renin releases the intermediate decapeptide angiotensin I. Then the last two C terminus amino acids of angiotensin I are removed by the zinc-metallopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (1Ehlers M.R. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5311-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). ACE inhibitors markedly reduce the formation of angiotensin II and are widely used in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy. In mammals, two isozymes of ACE have been described (2Corvol P. Michaud A. Soubrier F. Williams T.A. J. Hypertens. 1995; 13: S3-S10Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). One isozyme, termed somatic ACE, is made by a variety of somatic tissues, including vascular endothelium, proximal tubular epithelium of the kidney, macrophages, and intestinal epithelium. The other isozyme is only produced by germ cells in the testis and is called testis ACE (3Howard T.E. Shai S.Y. Langford K.G. Martin B.M. Bernstein K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4294-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 4Bernstein K.E. Semin. Nephrol. 1992; 12: 524-530PubMed Google Scholar). The study of ACE knock-out mice has provided convincing evidence that testis ACE is critical in male fertility. The two ACE isozymes are produced by the same gene from two different promoters (3Howard T.E. Shai S.Y. Langford K.G. Martin B.M. Bernstein K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4294-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In mouse, somatic ACE is a single polypeptide chain composed of 1,312 amino acids (5Bernstein K.E. Martin B.M. Edwards A.S. Bernstein E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11945-11951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Somatic ACE is an ectoenzyme where the majority of the protein is exported from cells by an N-terminal signal sequence. However, ACE remains bound to cell membranes by a C terminus hydrophobic domain and a short intracellular domain. Structural analysis of somatic ACE has shown that the extracellular region of the protein is composed of two homologous domains, each containing the HEXXH consensus active site motif typical of zinc-metallopeptidases. Each of these two domains, often termed the N- and C-terminal domains, is independently catalytic (6Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although renin is an extremely specific enzyme that only cleaves angiotensinogen, ACE is active on a large number of natural substrates, including angiotensin I, bradykinin, Substance P, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, and the hemoregulatory peptide N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP). In vitro studies demonstrated that both the N- and C-domains can hydrolyze angiotensin I, bradykinin, and substance P (6Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jaspard E. Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9496-9503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Corvol P. Williams T.A. Soubrier F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 283-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, some significant biochemical differences exist between the two functional domains of ACE (9Wei L. Clauser E. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13398-13405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, while both the N- and C-domains are activated by chloride ions, the C-terminal site is highly dependent on their concentration and is inactive in their absence. In contrast, the N-terminal catalytic domain is maximally activated with lower concentrations of chloride ions and retains residual catalytic activity even in their absence. Second, the two catalytic sites show differences in binding and interaction with competitive inhibitors. For example, lisinopril is a more effective inhibitor of the C-terminal catalytic site, whereas captopril has a higher affinity for the N-terminal site. Third, and perhaps most important, the two catalytic sites differ in their affinity and effectiveness in cleaving individual peptide substrates. For instance, whereas angiotensin I is cleaved with similar kinetics by the two catalytic domains, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone is preferentially cleaved by the N terminus. AcSDKP, thought to be an inhibitor of bone marrow proliferation, is catalyzed almost exclusively by the N-terminal catalytic domain of ACE (10Rousseau A. Michaud A. Chauvet M.T. Lenfant M. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3656-3661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Although the specificity of the two ACE catalytic domains has been studied extensively in vitro, virtually nothing is known about their relative roles in vivo. Thus, the physiologic relevance of each of the two catalytic domains is unknown. Knock-out mice lacking all ACE activity present with a complex phenotype (11Krege J.H. John S.W. Langenbach L.L. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Bachman E.S. Jennette J.C. O'Brien D.A. Smithies O. Nature. 1995; 375: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 12Esther Jr., C.R. Howard T.E. Marino E.M. Goddard J.M. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. Lab. Investig. 1996; 74: 953-965PubMed Google Scholar). These animals have a reduction of systolic blood pressure greater than 35 mm Hg as compared with wild-type animals. ACE knock-out mice have reduced aldosterone production and elevated serum concentrations of potassium. The mice are unable to effectively concentrate urine and, even in the absence of water restriction, produce larger amounts of a more dilute urine than wild-type mice. These functional renal defects accompany structural kidney malformations typified by underdevelopment of the renal medulla and papilla. Finally, ACE knock-out mice have a significant and highly reproducible anemia. There are two controversial hypotheses about the mechanism of impaired hematopoiesis in ACE-deficient mice. The first mechanism involves the accumulation of the hemoregulator tetrapeptide AcSDKP in the plasma of these mice. AcSDKP has been described as an inhibitor of bone marrow proliferation, acting to prevent the recruitment of stem cells into S phase (13Frindel E. Guigon M. Exp. Hematol. 1977; 5: 74-76PubMed Google Scholar). The second hypothesis explains the anemia as only due to the lack of angiotensin II and is supported by the correction of the hematocrit in ACE knock-out mice treated with angiotensin II (14Cole J. Ertoy D. Lin H. Sutliff R.L. Ezan E. Guyene T.T. Capecchi M. Corvol P. Bernstein K.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1391-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To assess the physiologic significance of each of the two ACE catalytic domains, we used gene targeting to create a mouse model where the ACE gene was mutated to specifically inactivate its N-terminal catalytic site. This modification does not affect the C-terminal site or the expression level of ACE protein. In addition, expression of testis ACE is normal in this model. Analysis of these mice showed that their blood pressure, renal function, and hematocrit were indistinguishable from wild-type mice. We also studied compound heterozygous mice in which one ACE allele was null (no ACE expression), and the second allele contained the mutations selectively inactivating the N-terminal catalytic domain. These animals produced roughly half the normal levels of the ACE protein and the ACE protein made lacks N-terminal catalytic activity. These mice also have a phenotype indistinguishable from wild-type mice. Thus, this study demonstrates that the presence of the C-terminal ACE catalytic domain is sufficient to maintain a functional RAS. It also strongly suggests that the anemia present in ACE null mice is not because of the accumulation of the peptide AcSDKP. Creation of Homozygous Mutant Mice—A 10.7-kb fragment of mouse genomic DNA was cloned from a mouse ES cell library derived from mouse strain 129. This contained 2.4 kb of the somatic ACE promoter and 8.3 kb encompassing somatic ACE exons 1–12. A 3.8-kb EcoR1 fragment containing exons 7–12 was subcloned, and site-directed mutagenesis was used to create the point mutations H395K and H399K in exon 8 of somatic ACE. These specific amino acid changes were previously reported to inactivate the enzymatic activity of the ACE N-terminal catalytic site (6Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second round of mutagenesis was then performed to create a BclI restriction site within intron 7 of somatic ACE. After reconstitution of the 10.7-kb segment of genomic DNA, a self-excising neomycin cassette (CAN-1, GenBank™/AF169416) (15Bunting M. Bernstein K.E. Greer J.M. Capecchi M.R. Thomas K.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) was cloned into the intron 7 BclI site. Finally, a thymidine kinase cassette was added at the 5′-end of the 10.7-kb segment. The targeting construct was linearized and electroporated into R1 ES cells (16Papaioannou V. Johnson R. Joyner A.L. Production of Chimeras and Genetically Defined Offspring from Targeted ES Cells. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 107-146Google Scholar). After positive and negative selection, individual ES cell clones were isolated and screened for targeted homologous recombination using a strategy of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genomic Southern blot analysis. Chimeric, heterozygote, and homozygous mutant mice were generated as previously described (12Esther Jr., C.R. Howard T.E. Marino E.M. Goddard J.M. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. Lab. Investig. 1996; 74: 953-965PubMed Google Scholar, 17Esther C.R. Marino E.M. Howard T.E. Michaud A. Corvol P. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2375-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). All studies were performed on F2 generation litters generated from the breeding of F1 heterozygous animals and on some animals obtained by breeding F2 homozygous ACE.7 mice with heterozygous ACE knock-out mice (ACE.1) (12Esther Jr., C.R. Howard T.E. Marino E.M. Goddard J.M. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. Lab. Investig. 1996; 74: 953-965PubMed Google Scholar). Age- and gender-matched littermate controls were used in all studies. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were supervised by the Emory University Division of Animal Research. Genotyping—Mice were genotyped by PCR with primers 5′-GCCACATTAGCTCAGTATCCC-3′ and 5′-GCATTGCTTAATCCTGGAGTGG-3′. The wild-type ACE allele amplified a DNA fragment of 241 bp, and the modified ACE.7 allele amplified a DNA fragment of 314 bp. A second set of primers (5′-GGTTGTTCAGACTACAATCTGACC-3′, 5′-AGCTTCAGGGCTCTGCTTTCCTGC-3′, and 5′-CAGACGAGCTCGGGATCTGGGTTGTCTGGT-3′) was used to amplify a fragment of 287 bp in the presence of the null ACE.1 allele and a DNA fragment of 215 bp from the wild-type or the ACE.7-modified allele. Characterization of the Mutant ACE Enzyme—Mice were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture, and blood was collected on ice in heparinized tubes. Plasma was immediately frozen and stored at –80 °C. ACE activity was then measured using different substrates to evaluate the separate activity of each ACE domain. Hip-His-Leu and N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-acetyl-Lys-Pro were used as C- and N-domain-specific substrates (6Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Azizi M. Massien C. Michaud A. Corvol P. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 1226-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Angiotensin I is both a C and N domain substrate (17Esther C.R. Marino E.M. Howard T.E. Michaud A. Corvol P. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2375-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 37 °C with 5 or 10 μl of mouse plasma during 30 or 60 min. Substrate concentration was 2.5-fold Km. The rate of hydrolysis of all substrates used was resolved and quantified by reverse HPLC (Waters Co, Milford, MA). Results were expressed in nmol/ml/min of generated hippuric acid, acetyl-Lys-Pro, and angiotensin II, respectively. Tissue ACE Expression—Tissue ACE activity and Western blotting were performed as previously described (19Cole J. du Quach L. Sundaram K. Corvol P. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For the preparation of protein extracts, animals were euthanized under anesthesia and organs were weighted and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Later, each organ was gently homogenized in ACE buffer (HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mmol/liter; NaCl, 150 mmol/liter; ZnCl2, 25 μmol/liter; and polyvinylidene difluoride, 1 mmol/liter). After centrifugation, the pellets were vigorously rehomogenized with ACE buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After a second centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and protein concentration was measured with the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. ACE activity was measured using the ACE-REA kit from American Laboratory Products Company, Ltd. (ALPCO, Windham, NH). ACE activity was defined as that inhibitable by captopril. For Western blotting, 20 μg of total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were probed with a 1:250 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse ACE antibody and exposed to X-ray film using enhanced chemiluminescence. Blood Pressure—Systolic blood pressure was measured using a Visitech Systems BP2000 (Apex, NC) automated tail cuff system as previously described (12Esther Jr., C.R. Howard T.E. Marino E.M. Goddard J.M. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. Lab. Investig. 1996; 74: 953-965PubMed Google Scholar, 20Krege J.H. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Smithies O. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were trained for 5 days prior to data collection. Systolic blood pressure was then measured in two sets of 10 measurements per day. The systolic blood pressure for an animal was the average blood pressure obtained over 4 days and consisted of 8 sets of 10 measurements. To measure plasma levels of angiotensin I and II, mice were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture and blood was collected on ice in tubes containing potassium-EDTA (1.6 mg/ml), amastatin (100 μmol/liter), bestatin (100 μmol/liter), and lisinopril (4 μg/ml) (14Cole J. Ertoy D. Lin H. Sutliff R.L. Ezan E. Guyene T.T. Capecchi M. Corvol P. Bernstein K.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1391-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Plasma was immediately frozen and stored at –80 °C. Angiotensin I and II levels were measured by radioimmunoassay as previously described (21Lachurie M.L. Azizi M. Guyene T.T. Alhenc-Gelas F. Menard J. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Blood Pressure after Infusion of Angiotensin I and II—Mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine and xylazine mixture (125 and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively). Animals were then placed on a 37 °C platform throughout the procedure. A polyethylene catheter (PE 10; Becton Dickinson) was inserted into the right carotid artery for direct blood pressure measurement using an MLT844 blood pressure transducer (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO). A separate catheter was inserted into the left jugular vein for drug administration. After blood pressure stabilized, 1 μl/g body weight of heparinized saline (50 units/ml heparin in 0.9% saline) was injected as a control. 1 μl/g body weight of 1 μm Ang I or Ang II (Sigma) was then injected, and the increase of mean arterial blood pressure was recorded. Plasma Renin Concentration—Plasma renin concentrations (PRC) were measured by enzymatic assay as previously described (22Menard J. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1972; 90: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 23Fuchs S. Germain S. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 717-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, PRC was determined by measuring the in vitro production of angiotensin I by radioimmunoassay after incubation with an excess of angiotensinogen from binephrectomized rat plasma. Plasma and Urinary AcSDKP Measurement—For plasma and urinary AcSDKP determinations, 10–5m lisinopril (Merck Sharp and Dohme) was added to heparinized tubes to prevent AcSDKP degradation by ACE. AcSDKP concentration was determined, directly in the urine or after methanol extraction from the plasma, by a competitive enzyme immunoassay (Spi Bio, Massy, France) as previously described (24Pradelles P. Frobert Y. Creminon C. Liozon E. Masse A. Frindel E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 986-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Urine creatinine was measured by automated enzymatic methods (Kodak Biolyzer; Eastman Kodak). Anemia and Hematocrit—To induce anemia, phenylhydrazine (60 mg/kg) was administrated intraperitoneally on two consecutive days (25Nandurkar H.H. Robb L. Tarlinton D. Barnett L. Kontgen F. Begley C.G. Blood. 1997; 90: 2148-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hematocrit was measured 1, 3, 5, 8, and 13 days after the second injection. To measure hematocrit, mice were bled from the tail vein and blood collected in heparinized self-sealing capillary tubes (Safe-Tec; ClinicalProducts, Inc., Ivyland, PA). These were centrifuged for 4 min at 12,000 × g and read in a manual capillary reader. Urine Osmolality—To determine urine concentrating ability, mice were water deprived for 24 h but given food ad libitum. Before and at the end of this 24-h period, a spot urine osmolality was determined using a Westcat 5500 vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Inc., Logan, UT). The mice were allowed to rehydrate for 3 weeks before any other experiments. Statistical Analysis—All data were expressed as means ± S.E. The significance of the difference between two groups was evaluated by an unpaired Student's t test. The significance of the difference among multiple groups was obtained by analysis of variance analysis. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Generation of Genetically Modified Mice—Both the ACE N- and C-terminal domains contain the protein motif HEMGH that is necessary for zinc binding and catalytic activity (Fig. 1A). In vitro, the conversion of this motif to KEMGK eliminates zinc binding and all catalytic activity (6Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate mice with a functional inactivation of the N-terminal domain, we used targeted homologous recombination to modify exon 8 as illustrated in Fig. 1B. A 10.8-kilobase portion of genomic DNA served as the template for the construct. In vitro mutagenesis was used to convert the zinc-binding histidines (amino acids 361 and 365) into codons encoding lysines. In addition, a self-excising neomycin cassette was positioned within intron 7. This cassette consists of a neomycin resistance gene driven by an RNA polymerase II promoter and Cre-recombinase driven by the testis ACE promoter (15Bunting M. Bernstein K.E. Greer J.M. Capecchi M.R. Thomas K.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The cassette is flanked with Lox P sites. This neomycin cassette is stable in ES cells and in chimeric founder mice. However, it is excised by Cre-recombinase expression in the developing male germ cells of the chimeric animals and is therefore absent in F1 heterozygous mice. This strategy allowed generation of mice with an intact ACE gene except for the N-terminal catalytic site mutations and a 34-bp Lox P sequence in the seventh intron. Because these mice were the seventh strain of genetically mutated mice prepared in our laboratory, they are referred to as ACE.7; the genotype of homozygous mutated animals is termed ACE 7/7, whereas the heterozygous and wild-type mice have ACE genotypes termed 7/wt and wt/wt. Targeted homologous recombination of mouse ES cells was carried out using standard techniques. Proper genomic targeting was verified by PCR, genomic Southern blot analysis using a DNA probe 3′ to the targeting construct, and selected sequence analysis of the ACE gene. To generate homozygous ACE 7/7 mice, we mated F1 heterozygous mice. Of 377 F2 pups, 53% were heterozygous (ACE 7/wt), 26% wild-type (ACE wt/wt), and 22% homozygous mutant (ACE 7/7). We observed no neonatal deaths between birth and weaning. Compound Heterozygote Mice—Previously, our laboratory characterized ACE knock-out mice, called ACE.1, that were prepared using targeted homologous recombination. The ACE 1 allele is null, and homozygous mutant mice, termed ACE 1/1, lack all expression of somatic and testis ACE. The mating of ACE.1 heterozygous mice (genotype 1/wt) with ACE 7/7 mice generated compound heterozygous mice, termed ACE 1/7, with Mendelian fidelity. ACE 1/7 mice have one copy of the ACE null allele (the ACE 1 allele) and one copy of the ACE 7 allele (N-terminal catalytically inactive). ACE Expression and Enzymology—To verify the inactivation of the N-terminal active site of ACE 7/7 mice, we measured the catalytic activity of plasma using synthetic ACE substrates specific for either the C- or N-terminal catalytic domains (Fig. 2A). To measure C-terminal catalytic activity, the substrate HHL was used. As anticipated, there was no significant difference in enzymatic activity between plasma from wild-type (wt/wt) and ACE 7/7 mice with this substrate. In contrast, ACE 1/7 mice had a 35% reduction of catalytic activity, reflecting reduced ACE expression because of the ACE 1 allele. Plasma from ACE 1/1 mice showed no activity against HHL or any ACE substrate. To investigate N-terminal ACE catalytic activity, hydrolysis of the N-terminal-specific peptide AcSDAcKP was measured (Fig. 2B). This peptide was efficiently cleaved by wild-type plasma, but very little enzymatic activity was exhibited by the plasma from ACE 7/7 mice (3.3 ± 1.1% of wild-type). We believe this residual activity is low-level cleavage of the substrate by the C-terminal domain and not nonspecific hydrolysis, because plasma from ACE 1/1 mice showed no such activity. We also investigated the ability of plasma ACE to convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II (Fig. 2C). ACE activity in 7/7 plasma was 68% that of wild-type mice. A reduction of about this magnitude was expected, given the known Kcat values for angiotensin I hydrolysis by each of the two ACE catalytic domains (11 s–1 for the N terminus, 34 s–1 for the C terminus). Also as expected, the ACE 1/7 plasma showed activity that was 38 and 56% that of wild-type and ACE 7/7 plasma, respectively. Thus, the enzymatic characterization of ACE 7/7 and ACE 1/7 mice is consistent with our molecular genotype and establishes that these mice produce an ACE protein that lacks N-terminal catalytic activity. ACE 1/7 mice produce less of this enzyme because of the presence of the ACE 1 null allele. Although ACE is found in plasma, the majority of the protein in an animal is bound to tissues such as the lung or kidney. To quantitate the tissue expression of ACE, we prepared detergent homogenates of lung, kidney, testis, brain, heart, and liver from wild-type, ACE 7/7, and ACE 1/7 mice (Fig. 3A). First, we measured ACE activity using [3H]hippuryl-glycylglycine as a substrate. This showed a consistent pattern exemplified by lung ACE expression. Compared with wild-type, ACE 7/7 mice had a modest reduction of activity (20%). This is probably due to a lack of N-terminal activity against this substrate. An equivalent reduction was observed in all tissues examined. In contrast, lung ACE activity in ACE 1/7 mice was 46 and 58% of wild-type and ACE 7/7. As with plasma, these figures reflect reduced ACE protein. To directly evaluate levels of protein expression, Western blot analysis was performed on the tissue homogenates using a polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse ACE antibody (Fig. 3B). Wild-type ACE is a protein of ∼170 kDa, whereas testis ACE is 95 kDa. As with ACE activity, all organs showed a similar pattern in which there was no difference in ACE expression between wild-type and ACE 7/7 mice. In contrast, ACE 1/7 mice showed a reduction of somatic ACE that reflected the presence of the ACE.1 allele, which is null for ACE expression. All three groups of mice showed an equivalent amount of testis ACE. This is expected, because our strategy does not affect either the expression or activity of this isozyme. Blood Pressure—To study the physiology of the mice, systolic blood pressure was measured in wild-type (wt/wt), heterozygous (7/wt), ACE 7/7, and ACE 1/7 mice (Fig. 4). Blood pressure was obtained in conscious, trained mice by tail cuff measurement. Fig. 4 shows the individual blood pressure determinations as well as the group mean for each genotype. Both ACE 7/7 and ACE 1/7 mice have systolic blood pressures indistinguishable from those of wild-type or heterozygous mice (7/wt). Specifically, whereas wild-type mice had an average blood pressure of 105.0 ± 2.2 mm Hg, ACE 7/7 and 1/7 mice had average systolic blood pressures of 110.1 ± 2.2 and 107.8 ± 1.9 mm Hg. Angiotensin and AcSDKP Peptide Levels—To understand blood pressure control in ACE 7/7 and ACE 1/7 mice, we measured the plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and II. As seen in Fig. 5, these peptides are found in levels identical to those measured in wild-type mice. Thus, the inactivation of the N-terminal catalytic domain had no effect on the ability of ACE 7/7 mice to produce plasma angiotensin II. Indeed, the normal plasma levels of angiotensin I suggest that there is little compensation of the RAS necessary for maintaining normal blood pressure. We also measured plasma renin activity in wild-type, ACE 7/7, ACE 1/7, and ACE 1/1 mice. This confirms the above conclusion because the concentration of renin in the plasma of ACE 7/7 mice is not different from that of wild-type. Not surprising, the ACE 1/7 mice have an elevat"
https://openalex.org/W1984357699,"Ankyrin-G polypeptides are required for restriction of voltage-gated sodium channels, L1 cell adhesion molecules, and β IV spectrin to axon initial segments and are believed to couple the Na/K-ATPase to the spectrin-actin network at the lateral membrane in epithelial cells. We report here that depletion of 190-kDa ankyrin-G in human bronchial epithelial cells by small interfering RNA results in nearly complete loss of lateral plasma membrane in interphase cells, and also blocks de novo lateral membrane biogenesis following mitosis. Loss of the lateral membrane domain is accompanied by an expansion of apical and basal plasma membranes and preservation of apical-basal polarity. Expression of rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G, which is resistant to human small interfering RNA, prevents loss of the lateral membrane following depletion of human 190-kDa ankyrin-G. Human 220-kDa ankyrin-B, a closely related ankyrin isoform, is incapable of preserving the lateral membrane following 190-kDa ankyrin-G depletion. Moreover, analysis of rat 190-kDa ankyrin G/ankyrin B chimeras shows that all three domains of 190-kDa ankyrin-G are required for preservation of the lateral membrane. These results demonstrate that 190-kDa ankyrin-G plays a pleiotropic role in assembly of lateral membranes of bronchial epithelial cells.

These results demonstrate that 190-kDa ankyrin-G plays a pleiotropic role in assembly of lateral membranes of bronchial epithelial cells. Assembly of specialized plasma membrane domains is a fundamental aspect of morphogenesis and physiological function of metazoan tissues (1Lecuit T. Pilot F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 2Mostov K. Su T. ter Beest M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Specification of the composition of membrane domains involves a combination of selective retention, de novo assembly from presorted membrane components, as well as remodeling through endocytosis-based sorting. The relative balance between these processes apparently varies extensively between epithelial cell types, and even within different epithelial cell lines (2Mostov K. Su T. ter Beest M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). A current challenge is to define the underlying common mechanisms for formation of membrane domains that may be shared by cells as diverse as neurons and epithelial tissues. The recent discovery of conserved proteins required for polarity in cells ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans single-cell zygotes to mammalian epithelial cells (3Knust E. Bossinger O. Science. 2002; 298: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 4Tepass U. Tanentzapf G. Ward R. Fehon R. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E39-E44Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) provides confidence that conserved pathways also exist for configuring plasma membrane domains. Ankyrins are a family of adaptor proteins present in most metazoan cells that associate with a diverse group of integral membrane proteins localized in specialized membrane domains (6Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). One example of polarized ankyrin-binding proteins are voltage-gated sodium channels and L1 cell adhesion molecules, which colocalize with 270/480-kDa ankyrin-G in axonal initial segments and nodes of Ranvier (7Kordeli E. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2352-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 8Jenkins S.M. Bennett V. J.

Another instance is the Na/K-ATPase, 1The abbreviations used are: Na/K-ATPase, sodium-potassium ATPase; nt, nucleotide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; siRNA, small interfering RNA. which localizes with 190-kDa ankyrin-G in basolateral domains of epithelial tissues (10Nelson W.J.

Physiol. 2003; 284: F358-F364Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of ankyrin-G in the mouse cerebellum results in the loss of 270/480-kDa ankyrin-G at Purkinje neuron axon initial segment accompanied by severe ataxia, loss of ability to fire action potentials, and loss of restricted localization of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6, L1 cell adhesion molecules neurofascin and NrCAM, and β IV spectrin (9Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that 270/480-kDa ankyrin-G is required for recruitment of multiple proteins to axon initial segments and may play a role in assembly of this domain. Ankyrin-G in epithelial cells has been proposed to retain the Na/K-ATPase within the lateral membrane domain by coupling to the spectrin-based membrane skeleton (13Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Nelson W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 73-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The sequence of events in assembly of the Na/K-ATPase in the lateral membrane has been suggested to begin with cell-cell adhesion mediated by E-cadherin (13Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Nelson W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 73-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 14McNeill H. Ozawa M. Kemler R. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1990; 62: 309-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Spectrin is then believed to be recruited to the sites of cell-cell adhesion through an interaction of α-catenin that binds to E-cadherin through β-catenin (15Pradhan D. Lombardo C.R. Roe S. Rimm D.L. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4175-4181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Na/K-ATPase, according to this model, is retained at the lateral membrane by binding ankyrin that tethers it to the spectrin-based membrane skeleton (13Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Nelson W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 73-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). A complex containing E-cadherin, spectrin, and ankyrin has been immunoisolated from polarized MDCK epithelial cells (16Nelson W.J. Shore E.M. Wang A.Z. Hammerton R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of the actin-binding domain of β-2-spectrin blocks assembly of the Na/K-ATPase (17Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. De Matteis M.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10711-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Several considerations suggest that spectrin may not be the primary membrane linker for ankyrin in epithelial tissues in vivo. Depletion of the sole α- and β-spectrin in C. elegans by RNAi (18Moorthy S. Chen L. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 915-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or by null mutation (19Norman K.R. Moerman D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Hammarlund M. Davis W.S. Jorgensen E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) revealed that spectrin, although essential for embryonic elongation and survival, was not required for the morphogenesis of polarized epithelial cells. Another caveat is that expression of β-2-spectrin domains can cause cell death (21Hu R.J. Moorthy S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, spectrin reversibly dissociates from sites at cell-cell contact under certain experimental conditions, whereas ankyrin remains membrane-associated (22Huotari V. Vaaraniemi J. Lehto V.P. Eskelinen S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The role of ankyrin-G in epithelial cells has not been experimentally tested. The single C. elegans ankyrin gene, unc-44, produces multiple transcripts, and the lone unc-44 allele removes a single transcript that displays an axon guidance defect (23Otsuka A.J. Franco R. Yang B. Shim K.H. Tang L.Z. Zhang Y.Y. Boontrakulpoontawee P. Jeyaprakash A. Hedgecock E. Wheaton V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Otsuka A.J.

We have used small interfering RNA (siRNA) encoded by a plasmid (25Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) to knock down the transcript encoding 190-kDa ankyrin-G in a polarized human bronchial epithelial cell line. This study reveals that ankyrin-G is required for lateral membrane biogenesis and preservation of the lateral membrane at steady state. Plasmids and Cloning—The pSuper plasmid (25Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. R. Agami (Netherlands Cancer Institute). 64-nt oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned as described into the pSuper plasmid (25Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). 19-nt siRNA target regions in the human ankyrin-G (GenBank™ NM_020987) membrane binding domain were chosen based on two criteria. 1) Nucleotide sequences were unique to the membrane-binding domain of the 190-kDa epithelial isoforms of ankyrin-G. 2) The nucleotide sequences were flanked 5′ by AA and on the 3′ by TT (25Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). 190-kDa ankyrin-G protein levels were depleted when the 19-nt ankyrin-G sequence, 5′-CATTTGCAATCAGAATGGG-3′, was targeted by the siRNA. The plasmids encoding rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G fused at the C terminus to GFP, human 220-kDa ankyrin-B fused at the C terminus to GFP, and chimeras between 190-kDa ankyrin-G and 220-kDa ankyrin-B have been described (26Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Anti-C-terminal ankyrin-G antibody was raised in rabbits following immunization with a recombinant protein composed of the death domain and regulatory C terminus of ankyrin-G. Antibody was purified on an affinity column made with the antigen. Anti-GFP antibody was made by immunization of a pig with purified recombinant GFP protein. The antibody was purified on a GFP affinity column. The affinity-purified β-2-spectrin antibody directed against spectrin repeats 4-9 has been described before (21Hu R.J. Moorthy S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cell Line and Transfection—Human bronchial epithelial cells were a gift of Dr. Peter Mohler. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Cells were trypsinized, and 60,000 cells were plated on 1.4-mm coverslip inserts of Matek plates (300 cells/mm2). Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) after 12 h with 1 μg of siRNA plasmid. For rescue experiments 100 ng of the rescue plasmid were mixed with 1 μg of siRNA plasmid and then transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000. The cells were analyzed at 14, 18, and 24 h post-transfection for cell survival using trypan blue dye exclusion. For immunoblot analysis 60-mm dishes were seeded with cells at 300 cells/mm2 and transfected with 5 μg of siRNA plasmid after 12 h. 14 h after transfection cells were lysed and processed for SDS-PAGE. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed using 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.25% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Cells were then incubated in 10% horse serum, 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 30 min to minimize nonspecific antibody binding. The cells were incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4 °C. The cell were washed with PBS four times and then incubated with the appropriate second antibody. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antibodies: anti-ankyrin-G (0.8 μg/ml) and anti-β2-spectrin (0.5 μg/ml); mouse monoclonal antibodies: anti-E-cadherin (2 μg/ml; BD Biosciences), anti-α-Na/K-ATPase (4 μg/ml; Affinity Bioreagents), anti-β-tubulin (1 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and ZO-1 (2 μg/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc.); goat polyclonal antibodies: anti-β-catenin (2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Ezrin (1 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Thy-1 (2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); pig polyclonal antibody: anti-GFP (1 μg/ml). The secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. The antibodies were all raised in donkey and included anti-mouse FITC, anti-mouse TRITC, anti-rabbit TRITC, anti-rabbit Cy5, anti-goat-FITC, and anti-swine FITC. Images were collected on a Zeiss LSM510 meta confocal microscope using either a 20× objective N.A 0.5 or 40× water immersion objective NA 1.2 and 1× digital zoom. A 100× oil objective NA 1.45 was used with a 1.4× digital zoom for observing cells undergoing cell division. Z stacks were collected at Z increments of 0.2 μm. XZ images were obtained from Z stacks using the orthogonal function of the LSM510 software. Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed as described (26Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Anti-ankyrin-G C-terminal antibody was used at 0.8 μg/ml. The primary antibody was detected using 125I-protein A/G. The blot was exposed to a phosphor screen for 8 h, and the screen was scanned on a Typhoon 9200 variable mode imager. Ankyrin-G Polypeptides Are Associated with the Lateral Membrane of Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells—This study addresses the role of 190-kDa ankyrin-G in the formation of membrane domains in epithelial cells using the human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE14o- (27Cozens A.L. Yezzi M.J. Kunzelmann K. Ohrui T. Chin L. Eng K. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Gruenert D.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) as a model system. Although this cell line has been used primarily to study the physiology of human airway epithelium, it has several features useful in the study of epithelial cell domains. The cell line shows the presence of tight junctions and displays asymmetric distribution of proteins, and monolayers of the cell line generate transepithelial resistance (27Cozens A.L. Yezzi M.J. Kunzelmann K. Ohrui T. Chin L. Eng K. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Gruenert D.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 28Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, these cells are of human origin, are morphologically uniform, and are readily transfected. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates from cells cultured for 26 h (see below) with affinity-purified antibody against the C-terminal regulatory domain of ankyrin-G revealed five ankyrin-G polypeptides of apparent molecular masses of 190, 150, 120, 110, and 50 kDa (Fig. 1A). XY and XZ confocal sections of cells following immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 1B) show that ankyrin-G immunoreactive polypeptides localize to the lateral membrane below the tight junctions marked by ZO-1 staining (green). This pattern is in agreement with the recently reported (11Thevananther S. Kolli A.H. Devarajan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23952-23958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Woroniecki R. Ferdinand J.R. Morrow J.S. Devarajan P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F358-F364Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) localization of ankyrin-G to the lateral membrane in MDCK cells. It is unclear from our experiments which of the ankyrin-G polypeptides localize to the lateral membrane. In some cells shown in the XZ confocal section, ZO-1 showed apicolateral staining (yellow in XZ section). Internal punctate localization of ZO-1 was observed in one cell. Such ZO-1 localization has been observed during the development of the tight junction both in cell culture as well as in vivo (29Rajasekaran A.K. Hojo M. Huima T. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 30Sheth B. Fontaine J.J. Ponza E. McCallum A. Page A. Citi S. Louvard D. Zahraoui A. Fleming T.P. Mech. Dev. 2000; 97: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Loss of the Lateral Membrane Following Depletion of 190-kDa Ankyrin-G—The pSuper plasmid (25Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) was used to drive the cellular expression of human 190-kDa ankyrin-G-specific small interfering RNA. The 19-nucleotide target sequences for the siRNA from homologous regions of the human and rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G are shown in Fig. 2A. The 19-nucleotide human target sequence for the human 190-kDa-specific siRNA differs from the homologous rat sequence (*, Fig. 2A) at three wobble positions. An siRNA that is different from the target nucleotide sequence at three positions is ineffective in producing knockdown (25Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). We have used the rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G-specific siRNA as an experimental control to monitor the nonspecific effects of expressing the human 190-kDa-specific siRNA in cells in all the following experiments. Plasmids directing expression of siRNA targeting human and rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G are designated pSuper-human-ankyrin-G and pSuper-rat-ankyrin-G, respectively. The effect of pSuper plasmid-driven expression of the human 190-kDa-specific siRNA on cell viability was tested using a trypan blue dye exclusion assay (Fig. 2B). Cells were transfected with pSuper-human-ankyrin-G, pSuper-rat-ankyrin-G, and pSuper 12 h after plating, and post-transfection cell viability was tested. 40-60% of the cells were transfected, as judged by reduction in intensity of ankyrin-G immunofluorescence staining (see below). Only 40% of the cells were viable 24 h post-transfection with pSuper-human-ankyrin-G (red bar, Fig. 2B), in contrast to the 98% viability of cells transfected with pSuper (black bar, Fig. 2B), and pSuper-rat-ankyrin-G (blue bar, Fig. 2B). However, 98% of the cells transfected with pSuper-human-ankyrin-G survive 14 h after transfection. At the 14-h time point following transfection, cells have been in culture for 26 h and thus are the same as the cells in Fig. 1B. All the following experiments were performed 14 h post-transfection of cells, when cell viability is preserved. Specific knockdown of 190-kDa ankyrin-G compared with the 150-, 120-, 110-, and 50-kDa ankyrin-G polypeptides was observed by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates from pSuper-human-ankyrin-G-transfected cells (lane 3, Fig. 2C). 190-kDa ankyrin-G is reduced by 40% in cell lysates from cells transfected with pSuper-human-ankyrin-G (lane 3, Fig. 2C) in comparison to cell lysates from untransfected (lane 1, Fig. 2C) and pSuper transfected (lane 2, Fig. 2C) cells. In contrast, the cell lysate from pSuper-rat-ankyrin-G plasmid-transfected cells showed levels of 190-kDa ankyrin-G polypeptide similar to that observed in cell lysates from untransfected (lane 1,Fig. 2C) and pSuper-transfected (lane 2, Fig. 2C) cells, indicating the lack of siRNA knockdown (lane 4, Fig. 2C). The comparable levels of ankyrin-G polypeptides different from the 190-kDa polypeptide in all four lanes show that a similar amount of total protein was present in each lane. This point is reinforced by the similar levels of actin in the four lanes. The level of ankyrin-G at the plasma membrane, as determined by immunofluorescence, was reduced by an average of 80% in cells transfected with pSuper-human-ankyrin-G, in contrast to cells transfected with the control plasmid pSuper-rat-ankyrin-G. This indicates a large fraction of plasma membrane-associated ankyrin-G is the 190-kDa ankyrin-G polypeptide. Depletion of 190-kDa ankyrin-G in bronchial epithelial cells resulted in the loss of the lateral membrane and expansion of apical and basal membranes (Fig. 3). The lateral membrane in control cells, seen extending from the tight junction marked by the ZO-1 staining to the base of the cell in the XZ section (left, Fig. 3B), is on the average of 7.3 μm in length (blue bar, top, Fig. 3C). In contrast, cells transfected with pSuper-human-ankyrin-G show an average length of lateral membrane of only 1 μm (red bar, top,Fig. 3C). Decrease in lateral membrane length following 190-kDa ankyrin-G knockdown is accompanied by an increase in cross-sectional area compared with control cells. Cells depleted of 190-kDa ankyrin-G polypeptide are 3.2-fold larger in cross-sectional area (red bar, bottom, Fig. 3C) than control cells (blue bar, bottom, Fig. 3C). Apical-Basal Cell Polarity Is Preserved Following the Loss of the Lateral Membrane in 190-kDa Ankyrin-G-depleted Cells—Both the XY (right, Fig. 3A) and XZ confocal sections (right, Fig. 3B) reveal that ZO-1 is retained at the plasma membrane between adjacent cells following the depletion of 190-kDa ankyrin-G. The arrowheads point to the sites of cell-cell contact where ZO-1 is still retained following 190-kDa ankyrin-G knockdown, despite the loss of the lateral membrane. Tight junctions therefore are preserved following depletion of 190-kDa ankyrin-G. The adherens junction protein E-cadherin still localizes to the sites of cell-cell contact in cells depleted of the 190-kDa ankyrin-G (Fig. 4). Cells transfected with pSuper-human-ankyrin-G that show loss of 190-kDa ankyrin-G (left, Fig. 4A) retain E-cadherin (right, Fig. 4A) at the plasma membrane between adjacent cells as visualized in XY sections as well as XZ sections (arrowheads, Fig. 4B). In control cells, E-cadherin localizes with ankyrin-G at the lateral membrane, although ankyrin-G is not present at the tight junctions (Fig. 4, A and B). The loss of the 190-kDa ankyrin-G and the consequent loss of the lateral membrane are also accompanied by the intracellular accumulation of E-cadherin (arrows, Fig. 4A). Another adherens junction resident protein β-catenin was also retained at the plasma membrane between cells depleted of the 190-kDa ankyrin-G (Supplemental Material Fig. 1). β-Catenin, like E-cadherin, showed intracellular accumulation in 190-kDa ankyrin-G-depleted cells (Supplemental Material Fig. 1). We next tested if the asymmetric distribution of proteins between the apical and basolateral membrane domains is maintained in cells depleted of 190-kDa ankyrin-G. XZ confocal sections of control cells show that α-Na/K-ATPase localized to the lateral membrane (NKA, left, Fig. 5A), whereas Thy-1 localized exclusively to the apical membrane (left, Fig. 5B). In cells depleted of the 190-kDa ankyrin-G, Thy-1 still was restricted to the apical surface (right, Fig. 5B). In addition, α-Na/K-ATPase that is lost from the plasma membrane following knockdown of 190-kDa ankyrin-G did not mislocalize to the apical membrane (left, Fig. 5B). β-2-Spectrin is also lost from the plasma membrane following the depletion of 190-kDa ankyrin-G (see below, Fig. 6). Retention of the polarized distribution of proteins to the apical domain and preservation of adherens junction proteins at sites of cell-cell contact indicate that the apical-basal polarity is preserved in cells following depletion of the 190-kDa ankyrin-G.Fig. 6Rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G is resistant to human 190-kDa ankyrin-G siRNA and prevents loss of the lateral membrane when expressed in human bronchial epithelial cells during siRNA depletion of endogenous 190-kDa ankyrin-G.A and B, coexpression of rat ankyrin-G-GFP (rAnk-G-GFP) but not GFP with pSuper-human-ankyrin-G plasmid encoding 190-kDa ankyrin-G-specific siRNA prevents the loss of lateral membrane and lateral membrane resident proteins β-2-spectrin and α-Na/K-ATPase (NKA). Cells were cotransfected with the pSuper-human-ankyrin-G (h) and rescue plasmids encoding GFP or rat ankyrin-G-GFP (listed above top row of panels) in a 10:1 ratio to ensure every cell expressing the rescue plasmid was depleted of 190 kDa of ankyrin-G. - indicates use of empty pSuper plasmid. 190-kDa rat ankyrin-G is resistant to the human 190-kDa ankyrin-G siRNA because of the variation in nucleotide sequence at three wobble positions (Fig. 2A). Cells were stained with three primary antibodies anti-β-2-spectrin (top panels), anti-α-Na/K-ATPase (middle panels), and anti-GFP (bottom panels).

Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with a mixture of the pSuper-human-ankyrin-G plasmid and the plasmid bearing the cDNA encoding the rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G fused to GFP. The plasmid mixture contained a 10-fold excess of the pSuper-human-ankyrin-G plasmid over the rat ankyrin-G-GFP plasmid to ensure the knockdown of the endogenous human 190-kDa ankyrin-G in every cell that expressed the rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G-GFP. A GFP-specific affinity-purified antibody allowed detection of cells expressing the rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G-GFP. We used this strategy, as our ankyrin-G antibodies cannot distinguish human ankyrin-G from rat ankyrin-G. Rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G is resistant to knockdown by human 190-kDa-specific siRNA as predicted. Cells cotransfected with pSuper-human-ankyrin-G and the plasmid expressing rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G-GFP show expression of rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G-GFP protein at the plasma membrane similar to control cells cotransfected with pSuper and the rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G-GFP plasmid (bottom panels of 3rd column and 4th column, Fig. 6A). Expression of rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G restored α-Na/K-ATPase and β-2-spectrin localization to the plasma membrane (top and middle panels, 3rd column, Fig. 6A) that was lost in cells cotransfected with pSuper-human ankyrin-G and GFP (top and middle panels, 2nd column). The increased cross-sectional area of cells resulting from depletion of the cellular 190-kDa ankyrin-G is also prevented by rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G (compare bottom panels, 2nd and 3rd columns). XZ confocal sections of cells cotransfected with the pSuper-human-ankyrin-G plasmid and the rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G-GFP plasmid show that exogenous rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G prevents the loss of the lateral membrane (right, Fig. 6B). In contrast, cells in the same XZ confocal section that do not express the rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G-GFP protein lack lateral membrane (right,Fig. 6B). GFP alone fails to preserve the lateral membrane in cells when coexpressed with human 190-kDa ankyrin-G-specific siRNA (left, Fig. 6B). The ability of rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G to prevent loss of lateral membrane when coexpressed with human 190-kDa-specific siRNA indicates that the rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G is functionally equivalent to the human bronchial epithelial cell 190-kDa ankyrin-G. The closely related human 220-kDa ankyrin-B, in contrast to rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G, does not preserve lateral membrane upon coexpression with the human 190-kDa ankyrin-G-specific siRNA (Fig. 7). Cell were cotransfected with pSuper-human-ankyrin-G and plasmids encoding either rat 190-kDa ankyrin-G-GFP (GGG,Fig. 7) or human 220-kDa ankyrin-B-GFP (BBB, Fig. 7). Ankyrin-B-GFP is resistant to human 190-kDa ankyrin-G siRNA, as affirmed by the GFP staining (BBB, GFP panel in Fig."
https://openalex.org/W1984562250,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) is implicated in a wide array of biological and pathophysiological responses, including tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis, therefore specific inhibitors of the kinase may prove useful in cancer therapy. We propose that specific inositol polyphosphates have the potential to antagonize the activation of PI 3-K pathways by competing with the binding of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. Here we show that Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 inhibits the serine phosphorylation and the kinase activity of Akt/PKB. As a consequence of this inhibition, Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 induces apoptosis in ovarian, lung and breast cancer cells. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt protects SKBR-3 cells from Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 enhances the proapoptotic effect of cisplatin and etoposide in ovarian and lung cancer cells, respectively. These results support a role for Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 as a specific inhibitor of the PI 3-K/Akt signalling pathway, that may sensitize cancer cells to the action of commonly used anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2022025232,"GroEL is an Escherichia coli molecular chaperone that functions in vivo to fold newly synthesized polypeptides as well as to bind and refold denatured proteins during stress. This protein is a suitable model for its eukaryotic homolog, heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), due to the high number of conserved amino acid sequences and similar function. Here, we will provide evidence that GroEL is rather insensitive to oxidants produced endogenously during metabolism, such as nitric oxide (·NO) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but is modified and inactivated by efficiently reactive species generated by phagocytes, such as peroxynitrite (ONOO–) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl). For the exposure of 17.5 μm GroEL to 100–250 μm HOCl, the major pathway of inactivation was through the oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide, established through mass spectrometric detection of methionine sulfoxide and the reactivation of a significant fraction of inactivated GroEL by the enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase B/A (MsrB/A). In addition to the oxidation of methionine, HOCl caused the conversion of cysteine to cysteic acid and this product may account for the remainder of inactivated GroEL not recoverable through MsrB/A. In contrast, HOCl produced only negligible yields of 3-chlorotyrosine. A remarkable finding was the conversion of Met111 and Met114 to Met sulfone, which suggests a rather low reduction potential of these 2 residues in GroEL. The high sensitivity of GroEL toward HOCl and ONOO– suggests that this protein may be a target for bacterial killing by phagocytes.

Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar). These proteins assist the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides (GroEL) or translocated preproteins (mitochondrial Hsp60). The functional unit of GroEL (and of most Cpn60 proteins) is a sandwich of two heptameric rings, which are stacked end to end. Depending on the protein substrate, different ligands such as K+, Mg2+, ATP, and the cofactor GroES (or Hsp10) may be required for proper folding. Following the trapping of an unfolded or misfolded protein substrate in the hydrophobic interior of GroEL, the binding of ATP and GroES causes a conformational transition, which changes the interior surface properties from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, thus triggering protein folding (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar, 2Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 68-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mammalian Hsp60 differs from GroEL in that it forms stable and functional heptameric rings in the absence of ATP and its cofactor Hsp10 (3Levy-Rimler G. Viitanen P. Weiss C. Sharkia T. Greenberg A. Niv A. Lustig A. Delarea Y. Azem A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our rationale for investigating the oxidative inactivation of GroEL is 2-fold: (i) its potential involvement in bacterial killing by phagocytes and (ii) a potential role for its analog, Hsp60, in an inflammatory and proapoptotic response during cardiovascular disease, as described below. Hsp60 proteins play an important role in the cellular protection against oxidative stress (4Cabiscol E. Piulats E. Echaves P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27393-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cabiscol E. Bellí G. Tamarit J. Echaves P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44531-44538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Studies with mutant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae exposed to various oxidants show that a decrease in Hsp60 expression results in an increased sensitivity toward oxidative stress (reduced cell viability) and increased levels of oxidized mitochondrial proteins, including Hsp60 itself (5Cabiscol E. Bellí G. Tamarit J. Echaves P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44531-44538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). An important question, which has not been addressed, is whether the oxidation of Hsp60 leads to its inactivation. If so, Hsp60 oxidation would further decrease the levels of active Hsp60 eventually leading to a more pronounced sensitivity of cells toward oxidative stress. Here, we will provide evidence that the bacterial analog of Hsp60, GroEL, is fairly insensitive to oxidants produced endogenously during metabolism, such as nitric oxide (·NO) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In contrast, GroEL is efficiently modified and inactivated through reactive species generated by phagocytes, such as peroxynitrite (ONOO–) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Such sensitivity toward phagocyte-derived oxidants suggests that GroEL oxidation may represent an effective mechanism for bacterial killing by neutrophils and macrophages. Peroxynitrite, the product of ·NO and superoxide (O2.), is highly toxic toward bacteria (6Zhu L. Gunn C. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochim. Biophys. 1992; 298: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 7Brunelli L. Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochim. Biophys. 1995; 316: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Hypochlorous acid is generated from chloride ions (Cl–) and H2O2 by the heme enzyme myeloperoxidase (8Thomas E.L. Infect. Immun. 1979; 23: 522-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sips H.J.

Aberrant Hsp60 may also play a role during inflammation of human tissue. Inflammatory processes contribute to the pathogenesis of some cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis (18Berliner J.A.

Mechanical shear stress, such as observed in atherosclerotic aorta, triggers the expression of Hsp60, which stimulates the expression of E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and interleukin-6 (22Kol A. Bourcier T. Lichtman A.H. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), thus promoting an inflammatory response (19Wick G. Xu Q. Exp. Gerontol. 1999; 34: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, stressed aortic endothelial cells present Hsp60 on the cell surface (23Xu Q. Schett G. Seitz C.S. Hu Y. Gupta R.S. Wick G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A similar observation was made for oxidatively stressed myocytes (hypoxia/reoxygenation), where translocation of cytosolic Hsp60 to the cell surface induced apoptosis (24Gupta S. Knowlton A.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2727-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, Hsp60 complexes the propaptotic protein bax, and upon translocation of Hsp60 to the cell surface, the Hsp60/bax complex dissociates and bax relocates into the mitochondria (24Gupta S. Knowlton A.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2727-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The molecular reason for Hsp60 translocation is not known. Coronary artery disease correlates with increased levels of myeloperoxidase (25Zhang R. Brennan M.L. Fu X. Aviles R.J. Pearce G.L. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Sprecher D.L. Hazen S.L. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 286: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) and myeloperoxidase-dependent markers for protein oxidation have been detected in low density lipoprotein isolated from human atherosclerotic intima (26Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Based on the sensitivity of GroEL to HOCl demonstrated in this paper, it is possible that myeloperoxidase-derived reactive species target human Hsp60 in the aorta and that oxidative modification and inactivation of Hsp60 contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The GroE molecular chaperonins of Escherichia coli were isolated from the lysate of cells containing the appropriate overexpression plasmids (gifts from Dr. Edward Eisenstein (27Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and Dr. Lorimer (28Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), respectively), as described by Voziyan and Fisher (29Voziyan P.A. Fisher M.T. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2405-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because GroEL and GroES do not contain tryptophan residues, the removal of tryptophan containing contaminants, as assayed by second derivative analysis of the absorption spectra and tryptophan fluorescence, was used as a criterion for purity of the chaperonin preparations in addition to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with silver staining. Stock solutions (∼10 mg/ml) were kept at 4 °C in 60% ammonium sulfate. Before each set of experiments, GroEL was exchanged into buffer A, consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium chloride, and 50 mm potassium chloride using Pierce Slide-A-Lyzer 3K Dialysis Cassettes. This was followed by exchange into 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, before final dialysis into buffer B consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium chloride, and 50 mm potassium chloride. The GroEL monomer concentration was determined by absorbance measurements using ϵ280 = 12,200 liter mol–1 cm–1 (30Fisher M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3955-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recombinant Shewanella methionine sulfoxide reductase B/A (MsrB/A) was a kind gift of Dr. T. C. Squier (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA) (31Buchanan M.V. Larimer F.W. Wiley H.S. Kennel S.J. Squier T.C. Ramsey J.M. Rodland K.D. Hurst G.B. Smith R.D. Xu Y. Dixon D.

This protein contains both reductase domains necessary to reduce both methionine sulfoxide diastereomers, Met-(R)-SO and Met-(S)-SO. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and methane sulfonic acid was purchased from Aldrich and H2O2 from Fisher Scientific. Peroxynitrite was synthesized from azide according to the method of Pryor et al. (32Pryor W.A. Cueto R. Jin X. Koppenol W.H. Ngu-Schwemlein M. Squadrito G.L. Uppu P.L. Uppu R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thioglo-1 was purchased from Covalent Associates (Woburn, MA). Sequencing grade modified trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI). ortho-Phthalaldehyde was from Pierce. dl-Methionine, diethylamine/nitric oxide (DEA/·NO) complex sodium salt, catalase, N-acetylcysteine, sodium iodoacetate, dithiothreitol (DTT), porcine mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (porcine mitochondrial MDH), ketomalonic acid, and β-NADH (reduced) were from Sigma. All other chemicals were from Fisher Scientific. Stock solutions of H2O2, –OCl (in 0.1% NaOH), and ONOO– were UV spectrophotometrically calibrated using ϵ240 = 39.4 liter mol–1 cm–1 for H2O2 (33Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), ϵ290 = 350 liter mol1 cm–1 (pKa at 25 °C is 7.537 ± 0.05) for –OCl (34Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (803) Google Scholar) and ϵ302 = 1,670 liter mol–1 cm–1 for ONOO– (35Hughes M.N. Nicklin H.G. J. Chem. Soc. (A). 1968; : 450-456Crossref Google Scholar). Nitric oxide was generated in situ by controlled release from the DEA/·NO complex at a ratio of 1.5 mol of ·NO/mol of DEA/·NO (36Maragos C.M. Morley D. Wink D.A. Dunams T.M. Saavedra J.E. Hoffman A. Bove A.A. Isaac L. Hrabie J.A. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in buffer B containing 1 mg/ml GroEL (17.5 μm monomer) and various concentrations of oxidant. All reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min except for the incubation with H2O2, which was run for 3 h, after which catalase (final concentration: ∼5nm) was used to quench residual H2O2. For HOCl and ONOO–, a final concentration of 5 mm Met was used to terminate the reactions. The activity of GroEL was determined through refolding of denatured MDH into the active form, according to the method by Tieman et al. (37Tieman B.C. Johnston M.F. Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44541-44550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDH was denatured in buffer A containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 8 mm DTT, for 1 h at room temperature. Refolding was initiated by rapid 100-fold dilution with buffer B (+components) resulting in the following concentrations: 1 μm (oligomer) native or oxidant-treated GroEL, 0.5 μm MDH, 2 μm GroES, and 5 mm ATP. The refolding reaction was carried out for 1 h at 37 °C before the enzymatic activity of MDH was determined using 1 mm ketomalonic acid and 0.2 mm NADH in buffer B (to 0.07 μm MDH). The rate of oxidation of NADH at 340 nm was followed for 3 min using a U3210 Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) spectrophotometer. Native or oxidant treated GroEL was denatured with 6 m guanidine HCl in 18.75 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Stock solutions of Thioglo-1 were prepared in dimethyl formamide and added to denatured GroEL samples to give a final molar ratio of 5:1 dye to free thiol (Cys). Calibration curves in the same concentration range were generated with N-acetyl-l-cysteine as a standard. Fluorescence yields were determined after 30-min incubation at room temperature using a Bio-Tek (Winooski, VT) FL600 Microplate Reader. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 360 and 530 nm, respectively. Hydrolysis was performed according to the method of Simpson et al. (38Simpson R.J. Neuberger M.R. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1936-1940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, GroEL samples were hydrolyzed in vacuo with 4 n methanesulfonic acid at 115 °C for 22 h and neutralized with 3.5 n sodium hydroxide. Methionine sulfoxide was separated from other amino acids by HPLC after precolumn o-phthalaldehyde derivatization as described previously (39Sharov V.S. Ferrington D.A. Squier T.J. Schöneich C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The o-phthalaldehyde derivatization reagent was prepared by mixing equal volumes of stock (25 mg of o-phthalaldehyde, 0.625 ml of methanol, 25 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol, 11.2 ml of 0.4 m K2HPO4, pH 9.5) with 1% Brij solution. The sample (10 μl) was mixed with 40 μl of the derivatization reagent for 1 min before adding 80 μlof 0.4 m KH2PO4. After another min, 100 μl of the sample was injected onto a Hypersil ODS column (4.6 × 250 mm; ThermoHypersil-Keystone, Bellefonte, PA). Methionine sulfoxide and Met were separated from the other amino acids at 35 °C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of 33–100% solvent B within 15 min, where solvents A and B were 95:5 (v/v) 25 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.85):tetrahydrofuran and 95:5 (v/v) methanol:tetrahydrofuran, respectively. Detection was by fluorescence (Shimadzu RF-10Asl; Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) with excitation at 330 nm and emission at 450 nm. The same separation conditions were also sufficient to resolve the o-phtalaldehyde-derivatized 3-chlorotyrosine from the other amino acids. Oxidant-treated GroEL samples were incubated with 1 μm MsrB/A and 15 mm DTT for 2 h at 37 °C. The final GroEL concentration was 15.8 μm in buffer B. Prior to tryptic digestion, native and oxidant-treated GroEL (starting concentration: 1 mg/ml) were reduced with 1 mm DTT in 6 m guanidine HCl for 30 min at 37 °C and alkylated with 3 mm sodium iodoacetate for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, dialysis into 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, was carried out using Pierce Mini Dialysis Units, with the final buffer exchange containing 10% acetonitrile. Trypsin was initially added at a 1:20 molar ratio to GroEL. After 1 h at 37 °C, another aliquot was added to adjust the final trypsin to GroEL molar ratio to 1:10 (total trypsin to GroEL). At this stage, samples contained ∼0.4 mg/ml GroEL. After 18 h, the digestion was stopped by cooling to –20 °C. On-line HPLC-MS/MS Analysis—For on-line HPLC-MS/MS analysis we used a ThermoElectron LCQ-Duo mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron Corp., San Jose, CA) coupled to a gradient HPLC consisting of two Micro-Tech Ultra Plus II gradient pumps. Samples (10 μlof ∼0.4 mg/ml peptides) were injected onto a Vydac 218MS5.305 C18 column (300-Å pore diameter, 50 × 0.32 mm) equilibrated with 90% mobile phase A (99.9% ultrapure water/0.1% formic acid) and 10% mobile phase B (99.9% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid). Gradient separation was achieved by a linear increase of the mobile phase ratio to 100% solvent B within 60 min and holding at this ratio for 5 min before returning to starting conditions. The following instrumental conditions were used for mass spectrometric analysis: number of microscans = 3, length of microscans = 200 ms, capillary temperature = 200 °C, spray voltage = 4.5 kV, capillary voltage = 14 V, tube lens offset =–17 V. Data acquisition was performed in the data-dependent fashion, i.e. a MS scan followed by MS/MS measurement with the normalized collision energy for MS/MS set at 35% and the isolation width of 2.0 m/z. A minimal signal for MS/MS acquisition was set to 2 × 105. Additionally, the dynamic exclusion option was enabled and set with the following parameters: repeat count = 3, repeat duration = 5 min, exclusion list size = 25, exclusion duration = 5, and exclusion mass width = 3. The sequence of native protein was matched using the TurboSEQUEST search option in the Bioworks Browser 3.1 software (ThermoElectron Corp.). Oxidatively modified sequences were matched manually by searching the data using the Xcalibur™ software package (ThermoElectron Corp.). The criteria for positive identification of a tryptic fragment were 1) matching of the observed m/z to the theoretical m/z and 2) matching of the collision-induced dissociation (CID) pattern to at least 3 consecutive fragment ions. Furthermore, confirmation of the location of modification in a peptide required the absence of the native residue. Off-line HPLC and MS/MS Analysis—For off-line mass spectrometric analysis, 50–100-μg aliquots of a tryptic digest were separated using a 5-μm 250 × 4.6 mm-Hypersil ODS column (ThermoHypersil-Keystone). The mobile phases used were 3% acetonitrile/97% water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 60% acetonitrile/40% water containing 0.1% trifluoroaceric acid (solvent B). A gradient of 0–100% solvent B over 120 min was generated using two Shimadzu LC-10AS pumps. The flow rate was 1 ml/min with detection at 215 nm using a Shimadzu SPD 10AV UV/VIS detector. Peaks were collected, lyophilized, and stored at –20 °C. Dry samples were solubilized in 90% methanol, 0.5% formic acid and introduced into an electrospray ionization source from a 20 μl injector loop at 10 μl/min. Spectra were acquired on a Q-Tof-2™ hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK). The instrument was operated for maximum resolution with all lenses optimized on the [M+2H]2+ ion from the cyclic peptide Gramicidin S. The cone voltage was 35 eV, argon was admitted to the collision cell at a pressure that attenuates the beam to about 20%, and the cell was operated at 8 eV (maximum transmission). Spectra were acquired at 11,364-Hz pusher frequency covering the mass range 100 to 3,000 atomic mass units and accumulating data for 5 s per cycle. Time-to-mass calibration was made with CsI cluster ions acquired under the same conditions. CID spectra were acquired by setting the MS1 quadrupole to transmit a precursor mass window of + 1.5 atomic mass units centered on the most abundant isotopomer. Argon was the collision gas admitted at a density that attenuates the beam to 20%; this corresponds to 16 p.s.i. on the supply regulator or 5.3 × 10–5 mbar on a penning gauge near the collision cell. The collision energy was varied from 20 to 35 eV to obtain a distribution of fragments from low to high mass. Spectra were acquired for 2–5 min in 5-s cycles. Spectra were acquired at 16,129-Hz pusher frequency covering the mass range 50–2,000 atomic mass units and accumulating data for 5 s per cycle. Chromatographic analysis of native and oxidant-treated GroEL was performed on a BIOSEP-SEC-S4000 300 × 7.8-mm column (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA) connected to a Shimadzu LC-10AS pump. The run buffer was 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 50 mm potassium phosphate (buffer B), at 1 ml/min flow rate. Detection was by a Shimadzu SPD 10AV UV/VIS detector at 280 nm. The injection volume was 50 μl of 1 mg/ml GroEL sample. Samples were run on 4–15% Phast Gels (non-reducing conditions) using a Pharmacia (Peapack, NJ) LKB Phast System. Protein was monitored by Coomassie Blue staining. The plots displayed in Fig. 1A reflect the activity of GroEL at refolding denatured MDH following treatment with various concentrations of oxidant. MDH is a class III type substrate (2Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 68-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), which requires the complete chaperonin system (GroEL and GroES) to refold. Any oxidation-dependent defects in the chaperonin system are more likely to show up with such a stringent substrate because of the multiple reactions that are necessary for a fully functioning chaperonin reaction (ATPase, GroES binding, GroES release, GroEL conformational changes, complex formation, polypeptide release). No significant inactivation of GroEL was observed when treated with 1 mm DEA/·NO for 30 min. Even treatment with 10 mm H2O2 for 3 h only caused 40% inactivation (data point not shown but was used to extrapolate data for 1 mm H2O2 in Fig. 1A). On the other hand, more than half of the activity of GroEL was lost when treated with either 0.5 mm ONOO– or 0.25 mm HOCl and ≥80% inactivation occurred with 1 mm ONOO– and 0.5 mm HOCl, respectively. The data demonstrate an efficient inactivation of GroEL by HOCl and ONOO– but negligible effects of ·NO and H2O2. We examined the potential reversibility of inactivation representatively for the exposure to HOCl (Fig. 1B). The inactivation of GroEL treated with 0.1–1.0 mm HOCl could not be reversed by reaction with 15 mm DTT alone (data not shown). In contrast, especially for GroEL treated with 0.1–0.25 mm HOCl, some of the lost activity could be recovered through exposure to 1 μm MsrB/A in the presence of 15 mm DTT. DTT is a suitable substitute for the physiological electron donor of methionine sulfoxide reductase, thioredoxin (40Brot N. Weissbach H. Biofactors. 1991; 3: 91-96PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation with MsrB/A recovered ∼70, 85, and 60% of the activity lost after treatment with 0.1, 0.175, and 0.25 mm HOCl, respectively. For HOCl concentrations ≥ 0.5 mm, the combination of MsrB/A with 15 mm DTT did not restore the activity. The activity of MsrB/A was independently confirmed through amino acid analysis of methionine sulfoxide after methanesulfonic acid hydrolysis of native and HOCl-treated GroEL. The exposure of GroEL samples to increasing concentrations of HOCl between 0.1 and 0.5 mm resulted in increasing yields of methionine sulfoxide which were restored to base-line levels through reaction with 1 μm MsrB/A and 15 mm DTT (data not shown). Fig. 1C displays the loss of free thiol residues in GroEL as a function of oxidant treatment. Clearly, the exposure to ·NO or H2O2 did not result in a significant loss of free thiols. In contrast, HOCl and ONOO– efficiently reacted with Cys. However, our results with MsrB/A suggest that by no means Cys oxidation alone can be responsible for protein inactivation. Analysis by On-line HPLC-MS/MS—Tryptic digests of native and oxidized GroEL (0.1, 0.25, and 1.0 mm HOCl; 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm ONOO–) were analyzed for oxidative modifications. For native GroEL we obtained a sequence coverage >85% matched to the primary sequence of GroEL (NCBI accession number NP_313151), as shown in Fig. 2. Table I summarizes all the detected modifications for the respective oxidizing conditions. We note that the employed mass spectrometric conditions did not allow for the quantitation of the protein modifications.Table ISummary of modified peptides detected by MS and MS/MS analysisFragment + modificationSequenceax indicates peptide identified by at least 3 consecutive fragment ions (MS/MS). ? indicates matching m/z but lack of unambiguous MS/MS.

https://openalex.org/W2094420854,"FAT10 is an interferon-γ-inducible ubiquitin-like protein that consists of two ubiquitin-like domains. FAT10 bears a diglycine motif at its C terminus that can form isopeptide bonds to so far unidentified target proteins. Recently we found that FAT10 and its conjugates are rapidly degraded by the proteasome and that the N-terminal fusion of FAT10 to a long lived protein markedly reduces its half-life. FAT10 may hence direct target proteins to the proteasome for degradation. In this study we report a new interaction partner of FAT10 that may link FAT10 to the proteasome. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified NEDD8 ultimate buster-1L (NUB1L) as a non-covalent binding partner of FAT10, and this interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments. NUB1L is also an interferon-inducible protein that has been reported to interact with the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8, thus leading to accelerated NEDD8 degradation. Here we show that NUB1L binds to FAT10 much stronger than to NEDD8 and that NEDD8 cannot compete with FAT10 for NUB1L binding. The interaction of FAT10 and NUB1L is specific as green fluorescent fusion proteins containing ubiquitin or SUMO-1 do not bind to NUB1L. The coexpression of NUB1L enhanced the degradation rate of FAT10 8-fold, whereas NEDD8 degradation was only accelerated 2-fold. Because NUB1 was shown to bind to the proteasome subunit RPN10 in vitro and to be contained in 26 S proteasome preparations, it may function as a linker that targets FAT10 for degradation by the proteasome.

Because NUB1 was shown to bind to the proteasome subunit RPN10 in vitro and to be contained in 26 S proteasome preparations, it may function as a linker that targets FAT10 for degradation by the proteasome. The covalent modification of proteins with lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chains is a signal for their degradation by the 26 S proteasome (1Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome consists of a central proteolytic unit, the 20 S proteasome, and one or two copies of the 19 S regulator (also called PA700) that bind to the ends of the cylindrical 20 S protease. The 19 S regulator in turn can be dissociated into a proximal “base” that is formed by a ring of six ATPases (designated Rpt1–6) and a distal “lid” of at least 12 non-ATPase subunits (named RPN1–12) (3Glickman M.H.

Four main functions can be assigned to the 19 S regulator; it serves as a receptor for polyubiquitylated proteins (4Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5van Nocker S. Deveraux Q. Rechsteiner M. Viersta R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar); and it opens the gate of the 20 S proteasome (10Köhler A. Cascio P. Leggett D.S. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Two subunits of the 19 S regulator, the non-ATPase subunit RPN10 (5van Nocker S. Deveraux Q. Rechsteiner M. Viersta R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and the ATPase subunit Rpt5 (6Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), have been shown to bind polyubiquitylated proteins and are thought to be substrate-docking sites. In addition to the direct binding of polyubiquitylated substrates to the proteasome, a second mode of substrate binding has been characterized. This association is mediated by adaptor proteins that possess ubiquitin-like domains that interact with the proteasome as well as ubiquitin-associated (UBA) 1The abbreviations used are: UBA, ubiquitin-associated; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; IFN, interferon; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NEDD, neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated; NUB1, NEDD8 Ultimate Buster-1; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein. domains that are able to bind polyubiquitylated proteins. Examples of these adaptor proteins are the RAD23 protein (11Chen L. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 12Rao H. Sastry A. J. Biol.

Virol. 2003; 77: 4149-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and the protein NEDD8 ultimate buster-1 (NUB1) (15Kamitani T. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol.

Although the overexpression of these proteins has been shown to induce the degradation of non-covalently interacting proteins in several cases, it is still a matter of debate whether these adaptors are mediators of proteasomal degradation or whether they serve to regulate the degradation process in a negative manner possibly by competing with the 26 S proteasome for binding of polyubiquitylated substrates (18Raasi S. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8951-8959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Most interesting, it seems that UBA domains may also bind ubiquitin-like domains as has been shown for NUB1, which interacts in vitro with the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 and mediates its accelerated degradation (15Kamitani T. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46655-46660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Kito K. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol.

It has often been emphasized that ubiquitin-like proteins, which become isopeptide-linked to target proteins through selective cascades of activating enzymes, conjugating enzymes, and ligases, serve purposes other than targeting for proteasomal degradation, as for instance changes of intracellular localization, alterations of enzymatic activity, or the modification of DNA binding. Recently, we and others have shown that a novel member of these so-called ubiquitin-like modifiers that was first described under the name of “diubiquitin” (19Fan W. Cai W. Parimoo S. Lennon G.G. Weissman S.M. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and subsequently renamed to “FAT10,” is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (20Raasi S. Schmidtke G. Groettrup M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35334-35343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 21Liu Y. Pan J. Zhang C. Fan W. Collinge M. Bender J.R. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). FAT10 consists of two ubiquitin-like domains that are joined by a short linker. It should be emphasized, however, that FAT10 is distinct from the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15 (also called ubiquitin cross-reactive protein) that also consists of two ubiquitin-like domains (22Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The inducible expression of FAT10 in fibroblasts led to the appearance of the 18-kDa protein FAT10 as well as three closely migrating covalent conjugates at about 35 kDa which, like unconjugated FAT10, were degraded by the proteasome with a half-life of 1 h (20Raasi S. Schmidtke G. Groettrup M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35334-35343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Mutation of the C-terminal diglycine motif of FAT10 abolished the conjugate formation, thus strongly suggesting that FAT10 becomes isopeptide-linked via its C-terminal diglycine motif in analogy to ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like modifiers as SUMO, NEDD8, or ISG15, for example (22Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In contrast to these well characterized protein modifiers, the putative activating and conjugating enzymes for FAT10 have not been identified. Most interesting, the fusion of FAT10 to the N terminus of the long lived green fluorescent protein (GFP) led to its rapid degradation in HeLa cells. 2M. S. Hipp, S. Raasi, M. Groettrup, and G. Schmidtke, submitted for publication. FAT10 and ubiquitin were equally efficient at targeting GFP for degradation when fused to its N terminus, thus underlining the potency of FAT10 as a degradation signal. Taken together, it seems that FAT10 in contrast to other ubiquitin-like modifiers targets its conjugation substrates for proteasomal degradation. Although several interesting properties of FAT10 have been described, the biological function of FAT10 has so far remained elusive. FAT10 is encoded in the major histocompatibility complex class I region and is inducible in many different cell lines with the proinflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (21Liu Y. Pan J. Zhang C. Fan W. Collinge M. Bender J.R. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Raasi S. Schmidtke G. Giuli R.D. Groettrup M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 4030-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, FAT10 is up-regulated upon the activation of B cells and dendritic cells (24Bates E.F.M. Ravel O. Dieu M.C. Ho S. Guret C. Bridon J.M. AitYahia S. Briere F. Caux C. Banchereau J. Lebecque S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2471-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which could hint at a function in antigen processing, but so far we have failed to substantiate this hypothesis experimentally. Interestingly, the induced expression of FAT10 causes apoptosis in fibroblasts, suggesting that it may be functionally involved in the TNF-α-triggered apoptosis pathway (20Raasi S. Schmidtke G. Groettrup M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35334-35343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In seeming contradiction to this hypothesis, the FAT10 mRNA has been found recently to be highly up-regulated in numerous gynecological and gastrointestinal tumors, but it was not reported whether the fat10 gene was mutated in these tumors or not (25Lee C.G. Ren J. Cheong I.S. Ban K.H. Ooi L.L. Yong Tan S. Kan A. Nuchprayoon I. Jin R. Lee K.H. Choti M. Lee L.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2592-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is therefore not yet clear whether FAT10 has the properties of an oncogene or a tumor suppressor. An involvement of FAT10 in cell cycle regulation was proposed by Liu et al. (21Liu Y. Pan J. Zhang C. Fan W. Collinge M. Bender J.R. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) who reported a non-covalent interaction of FAT10 with the nuclear spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2, but the physiological consequences of this association have remained unclear. In order to learn more about the function of FAT10 and to possibly identify enzymes involved in FAT10 conjugation, a two-hybrid interaction screen was performed that identified NUB1L as a FAT10 interaction partner, and this firm non-covalent interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments. Strikingly, NUB1L expression led to an accelerated degradation of FAT10 suggesting that NUB1L may target FAT10 for proteasomal degradation. The following antibodies were used: QIAexpress™ mAb anti-His6 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), mAb anti-HA clone HA-7 (Sigma) mAb anti-Xpress™ (Invitrogen), and a FAT10-specific polyclonal antibody that was raised in rabbits by immunization with GST-FAT10 recombinant protein. For confocal microscopy, the following fluorescence-labeled mAbs were used: fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-HA (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science) and Alexa Fluor™ 594-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were purchased from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). For generation of HA-NUB1L, His-NUB1L, GST, and GST-FAT10 proteins, NUB1L cDNA was PCR-amplified from the yeast two-hybrid prey plasmid pmg8-1 using 5′-CGGGAGGTACCTGGCGCAGGGATGGCAC-3′ as forward and 5′-CTATCTAGATTAGTTTTTCTTTGTTGCTGAC-3′ as reverse primer. The PCR product was cloned via Asp-718 and XbaI sites into the plasmid pCDNA3.1. The sequence between the HindIII and Asp-718 sites of the original vector was replaced by the sequence 5′-AAG CTT ACC ATG GCC TAC CCC TAC GAC GTG CCC GAC TAC GCC GCG GTA CC-3′ to create an in-frame fusion protein of influenza HA epitope and Nub1L (HA-NUB1L pcDNA). For the recombinant expression of a His6-NUB1L fusion protein in Escherichia coli, the sequence between HindIII and Asp-718 was replaced by the sequence 5′-AAG CTT TAA GAA GGA GAT ATA AAT ATG GCC CGG GGT TCT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT GGT ATG GCT AGC ATG ACT GGT GGA CAG CAA ATG GGT GCG GTA CCT-3′ (His6-NUB1L RBS-pcDNA). This plasmid was transformed into a BL21 (DE3)pLysS E. coli host strain. The expression of the His-NUB1L fusion protein was induced with isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography using a HiTrap™ affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. In order to produce the GST-FAT10 fusion protein, the FAT10 cDNA was retrotranscribed from mRNA of JY B cells and amplified, using primers sense 5′-CCATGGATCCATGGCTCCCAATGCTTCCTGCCTC-3′ and antisense 5′-CCGTCTCGAGTCTCACCCTCCAATACAATAAGATGC-3′, and cloned via BamHI and XhoI sites into the expression vector pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). BL21 cells were transformed with this construct, and the GST-FAT10 fusion protein was induced with isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and purified by glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) according to protocols provided by the supplier. Generation of His6-Xpress-FAT10-pBI, HA-FAT10-pBI, HA-NUB1L-pBI, His6-Xpress-FAT10-HA-NUB1L-pBI, and HA-FAT10-HANUB1L-pBI—His6-Xpress-FAT10-pcDNA3.1 and HA-FAT10-pcDNA3.1 have been described previously (20Raasi S. Schmidtke G. Groettrup M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35334-35343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The two differently tagged versions of FAT10 as well as HA-tagged NUB1L were excised from pcDNA3.1 via HindIII and XbaI and cloned into the vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene, Amsterdam). HA-NUB1L was excised from pBK-CMV with NotI and PstI and cloned into the MCSII of the vector pBI (Clontech). The two FAT10 clones were excised with BssHII and XbaI from pBK-CMV, and each of them was cloned into the multiple cloning site of pBI and HA-NUB1L-pBI via MluI and NheI. Generation of GFP Fusion Proteins—In order to create fusion proteins of ubiquitin or fat10 with the N terminus of GFP, we used the pcDNA3-based plasmids HA-FAT10 (20Raasi S. Schmidtke G. Groettrup M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35334-35343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and HA-ubiquitin. 3M. Basler, unpublished data. The primer 5′-AGA CGG AAG CTT ACC ATG GCC TAC CCC-3′ was used as forward primer for all PCRs. For fat10 we used the reverse primer 5′-ATT GCG GGA TCC GCC ACT GCA ATA CAA TAA G-3′ to replace the diglycine by Ala-Val in order to prevent a potential proteolytic processing. Ubiquitin was amplified with the reverse primer 5′-ATA TGG ATC CGC CAC TGC AGA GTC CGC TTC CTG-3′, which also replaces the diglycine by Ala-Val. After amplification, the PCR products were cloned via HindIII and BamHI restriction sites into pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). In order to obtain a SUMO-1 cDNA, we prepared human RNA from HeLa cells according to standard procedures. First strand cDNA synthesis and reverse transcriptase PCR was performed according to the instructions provided by the supplier (Roche Applied Science). We used the primers 5′-CGC CGC GGT ACC TAT GTC TGA CCA GGA G-3′ and 5′-ATA TGG ATC CGC CAC TGC CGT TTG TTC CTG ATA-3′ to mutate the C-terminal diglycine to Ala-Val. The PCR product was digested with Asp-718 and BamHI and cloned into pEGFP N1. All sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing. GST-FAT10 and GST proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21. Bacteria were pelleted and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline plus 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation the supernatant was incubated with 250 μl of glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B for 4 h at 4 °C on an end-over-end rotor. An aliquot was tested for similar binding of GST and GST-FAT10. After extensive washing, 575 μl of nickel-affinity purified NUB1L-His (50 μg/ml) was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C end-over-end. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline before boiling in a sample buffer containing 5% SDS and 10% β-mercaptoethanol. Graded aliquots of the lysate were analyzed on Western blots probed with an anti-His6 mAb. HEK293 cells were grown on coverslips to about 30% confluence at the time of transfection. The plasmids HA-NUB1L-pBI, His6-Xpress-FAT10-pBI, and His6-Xpress-FAT10-HA-NUB1L-pBI were introduced into different aliquots of cells together with the plasmid p-Tet-splice-tTA (26Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) to induce the expression of the genes. We used FuGENE™ transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) for transfection at a reagent to DNA ratio of 3:1. After 16 h of incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA, 2% fetal calf serum, 2 mm azide, and 0.1% saponin. The differently transfected cells and the mock transfectants were stained with anti-HA-fluorescein isothiocyanate (the His6-Xpress-FAT10-pbi transfectant served as negative control), anti-Xpress™, and Alexa Fluor™ 594 goat anti-mouse (the HA-NUB1L-pBI transfectant served as negative control) or with all three antibodies, followed by analysis with a laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (LSM 510; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The yeast two-hybrid screen using the fat10 bait was carried out by Dualsystems Biotech AG, Zurich, Switzerland. The bait construct for yeast two-hybrid screening was made by subcloning the full-length human fat10 cDNA into the vector pLexA-DIR (Dualsystems Biotech AG, Zurich, Switzerland). The bait construct was transformed into the strain L40 (MATa his3Δ200 trp1-901 leu2-3,112 ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ GAL4) using standard procedures (27Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 816-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Correct expression of the bait was verified by Western blotting of cell extracts using a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the LexA domain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The absence of self-activation was verified by cotransformation of the bait together with a control prey and selection on minimal medium lacking the amino acids tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (selective medium). For the yeast two-hybrid screen, the bait was cotransformed together with a human adult whole lymph node cDNA library (complexity 1 × 106, Clontech) into L40. A number of 8.2 × 105 transformants were screened, yielding 86 transformants that grew on selective medium. Positive transformants were tested for β-galactosidase activity using a filter assay (28Serebriiskii I.G. Golemis E.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Out of 86 initial positives, 38 clones showed β-galactosidase activity and were considered to be true positives. Library plasmids were isolated from positive clones and retransformed into L40 with the bait plasmid and with a control bait encoding a LexA-lamin C fusion. Only 6 of 38 positives showed β-galactosidase activity when coexpressed with the bait but not when coexpressed with the control bait and were considered to be bait-dependent positive interactors. The identity of positive interactors was determined by sequencing. For the experiments presented in Fig. 3, we used the plasmids His6-Xpress-FAT10-pBI, HA-NUB1L-pBI, and His6-Xpress-FAT10-HA-NUB1L-pBI. The data generated for Fig. 5 were obtained with the plasmids HA-FAT10-pBI, HA-NUB1L-pBI, and HA-FAT10-HA-NUB1L-pBI. HEK293 cells were transfected with the plasmids indicated in the figure legends and the inducer pTet-splice-tTa. 16 h after transfection the cells were starved for 1 h in Met/Cys-free RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, followed by labeling for 1 h with 0.25 mCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (Translabel, Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently cells were washed three times, aliquoted, and chased for the indicated times. For the data in Fig. 3, the labeled cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g, 1 volume of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl was added to the supernatant, and an aliquot was analyzed with a β-counter. For the experiment presented in Fig. 5, cells were lysed in RIPA Buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged and counted as described above. Equal amounts of radioactivity were used for immunoprecipitation with either 5 μg of anti-HA antibody or 20 μg of anti-FAT10 antibody and protein G or protein A-Sepharose™ CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences). The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with agitation. After five washes with the respective lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography on a Fuji BAS1500 radioimager.Fig. 5NUB1L expression reduces the half-life of FAT10.A, HA-FAT10 either alone (left panel) or together with HA-NUB1L (right panel) was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. The cells were labeled for 1 h with [35S]Cys/Met and chased for the indicated times prior to HA-specific immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. Molecular mass markers are indicated to the left in kDa, and immunoprecipitated proteins are indicated with an arrowhead. The asterisk denotes an unspecific band. B, the HA-FAT10 bands from three experiments were quantified on a radioimager and plotted as percent radioactivity based on values of the pulsed cells. Filled boxes denote degradation in the presence of NUB1L; filled diamonds denote degradation in the absence of NUB1L.

Typical experiments out of 3–4 independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of NUB1 as a FAT10 Interaction Partner by Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—To identify putative novel interaction partners of human FAT10, we screened a human lymph node cDNA library using a LexA-based yeast two-hybrid system (29Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Screening of 8.2 × 105 transformants yielded six bait-dependent clones that were analyzed further. Sequencing the insert of the plasmid recovered from one of the six transformants yielded the full-length in-frame cDNA of NUB1L. NUB1 was first described by Yeh and co-workers as a protein of 601 amino acids and a molecular mass of 69.1 kDa which interacts with the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 (GenBank™ accession number AF300717) (15Kamitani T. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46655-46660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Kito K. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20603-20609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the NUB1 insert recovered from our two-hybrid screen revealed that the predicted amino acid sequence contained 14 amino acids more than the published sequence which were inserted between amino acid 451 and 452 of the published sequence for human NUB1 (Fig. 1). The original human NUB1 sequence contains two UBA domains of 37 amino acids spanning residues 376–413 and 477–514. Most interesting, the 14-amino acid insertion at residue 451 as predicted for our FAT10 interaction partner completes a partial UBA domain situated between residues 432 and 455 of human NUB1. It therefore appears that like the published NUB1 homologues of mice (GenBank™ accession number AF534114), Drosophila (GenBank™ accession number AE003752), and Arabidopsis (GenBank™ accession number AC007295), the human NUB1 protein variant found to interact with FAT10 contains three UBA domains in its C-terminal half. While we were preparing this manuscript, Yeh and co-workers (17Tanaka T. Kawashima H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32905-32913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported the existence of a longer splice variant of human NUB1, which they named NUB1L. Because our FAT10 interaction partner is identical to NUB1L except for an alanine residue at position 200, which was not found in our sequence, we adopted the name for this report. Recombinant GST-FAT10 and His-NUB1L Fusion Proteins Interact Specifically in Vitro—NUB1L has interesting properties that are consistent with an interaction with FAT10. Like FAT10, it is inducible with IFN-γ, and it has three UBA domains that could potentially mediate binding to one or both of the ubiquitin-like domains of FAT10. We hence decided to focus on NUB1L as a FAT10-binding protein. At first we tried to confirm the yeast two-hybrid result in a GST pull-down experiment. A bacterial expression construct for a human GST-FAT10 fusion protein was generated, and the bacterially expressed GST-FAT10 protein was purified over a glutathione-Sepharose column. A His6-tagged version of human NUB1L was cloned into a bacterial expression vector, expressed in bacteria, and purified over a nickel-Sepharose matrix. GST-FAT10 as well as GST protein as negative control were bound to glutathione-Sepharose and incubated for 2 h with purified His-NUB1L protein. The glutathione matrix was washed, and bound proteins were eluted and analyzed in 5-fold dilutions on anti-His Western blots. As shown in Fig. 2A, His-NUB1L specifically bound to the GST-FAT10 matrix but not to the GST control, thus indicating that FAT10 and NU"

In this report, we show that cAMP-induced autocrine interleukin 6 (IL-6) promoted astrocytic differentiation of C6 cells. Treatment of cells with N6,2′-O-dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2AMP) and theophylline caused the delayed phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), as well as the expression of an astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Overexpression of the dominant-negative form of STAT3 leads to the suppression of GFAP promoter activity, suggesting that STAT3 activity was essential for cAMP-induced GFAP promoter activation. On the other hand, the IL-6 gene was quickly induced by Bt2AMP/theophylline, and subsequent IL-6 protein secretion was stimulated. In addition, recombinant IL-6 induced GFAP expression and STAT3 phosphorylation. Most importantly, treatment with IL-6-neutralizing antibody dramatically reduced the cAMP-induced GFAP expression and STAT3 phosphorylation and reversed the cellular morphological changes that had been caused by Bt2AMP/theophylline. Taken together, these results indicated that Bt2AMP/theophylline lead to delayed STAT3 activation via autocrine IL-6. These processes subsequently led to the induction of GFAP. IL-6 secretion is thus thought to be a key event in controlling the astrocytic differentiation of C6 cells.

IL-6 secretion is thus thought to be a key event in controlling the astrocytic differentiation of C6 cells. Astrocyte differentiation occurs largely during the postnatal period (1Qian X. Shen Q. Goderie S.K. He W. Capela A. Davis A.A. Temple S. Neuron. 2000; 28: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), and the timing of the differentiation is regulated by various extracellular cues and cell-intrinsic programs (2Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 211-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The extracellular stimuli known to promote astrocyte differentiation are fetal calf serum (3Raff M.C. Miller R.H. Noble M.

Taga T. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 25: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The IL-6 family of cytokines, oncostatin M and cardiotrophin-1, are known to activate a downstream transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and then the activated STAT3 binds to the promoter region of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene, an astrocyte marker, thereby inducing the expression of GFAP (7Yanagisawa M. Nakashima K. Taga T. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 269: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Ochiai W Yanagisawa M Takizawa T Nakashima K Taga T. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). STAT3 belongs to the STAT family of transcription factors, which play crucial roles in various intracellular signaling cascades involved in proliferation and differentiation (9Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 10Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 21-51Crossref Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). In response to activation of cell-surface receptors, STAT3 is phosphorylated on its Tyr705 residue by Janus kinase (JAK), and this leads to STAT3 dimerization, subsequent nuclear translocation, and the transactivation of its target genes (11Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Bone morphogenic protein 2 synergistically acts with leukemia inhibitory factor, another IL-6 family of cytokines, to induce astrocytogenesis by promoting the complex formation of respective downstream transcription factors, Smads and STAT3, which are bridged by transcriptional coactivator p300 (12Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The above-mentioned reports have extensively elucidated the mechanisms of cytokine-induced astrocyte differentiation. However, there remain other factors that induce differentiation by unknown mechanisms. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide is one of the most potent activators of adenylate cyclase in pituitary cells (13Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A. Jiang L. Culler M.D. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar), and its receptor is expressed in the subventricular zone, an area that gives rise to both neurons and glia, around the onset of gliogenesis (14Basille M. Vaudry D. Coulouarn Y. Jegou S. Lihrmann I. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Gonzalez B. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 425: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Jaworski D.M. Proctor M.D. Dev. Brain Res. 2000; 120: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It was shown recently (5Vallejo I. Vallejo M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that cAMP-elevating stimuli including pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide can induce astrocytogenesis of rat cortical precursors. Therefore, intracellular cAMP seems to play an important role in controlling astrocyte differentiation. However, the mechanism of cAMP in astrocyte differentiation remains unclear. A C6 rat glioma cell line is known to express astrocyte markers by cAMP-elevating stimuli such as N-substituted cAMP analogues and cAMP-increasing reagents (16Davies D.L. Vernadakis A. Brain Res. 1986; 389: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Messens J. Slegers H. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Yoshimura S. Sakai H. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. Shinoda J. Sakai N. Yamada H. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Several protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms are induced during cAMP-dependent C6 differentiation (18Yoshimura S. Sakai H. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. Shinoda J. Sakai N. Yamada H. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Brodie C. Kuperstein I. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These proteins are thus suggested to be involved in C6 differentiation. However, the signaling cascade in this cAMP-induced differentiation of C6 cells is not yet fully understood. We speculated that STAT3, which is essential for IL-6 family of cytokine-dependent GFAP gene expression, might be also involved in the cAMP-dependent GFAP expression in C6 cells. To examine this hypothesis, the effect of cAMP on the activation of STAT3 and the effect of STAT3 activity on cAMP-dependent GFAP induction in C6 cells were examined. In the process of conducting this study, we found that cAMP-induced autocrine IL-6 was important for STAT3 activation and subsequent GFAP expression. Materials—Antibodies against GFAP, mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate, and rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against STAT3 and the STAT3 phosphoform STAT3 Tyr705 were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-mouse IL-6-neutralizing antibody was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Other chemicals and materials were purchased from the following manufacturers: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum albumin, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen; kinase inhibitors H89, SP600125, SB203580, and GF109203X were purchased from Calbiochem; a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline, was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan); a cAMP analogue, N6,2′-O-dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2AMP), was purchased from Sigma; recombinant rat IL-6 was obtained from R&D Systems; and the ECL Western blot detection system was from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—The C6 rat glioma cell line (ATCC number CCL 107) used in this study was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The C6 cells used for Western blotting, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were differentiated as described previously (20Takanaga H. Kunimoto M. Adachi T. Tohyama C. Aoki Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were thawed from a frozen stock (48-52 passages) for each experiment and were cultured for 2 days. The cells were replated on 100-mm culture plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/plate and were cultured for an additional 2 days. Cells were serum-starved for 1 h, 1 mm Bt2AMP and 0.25 mm theophylline (Bt2AMP/theophylline) were added to the medium, and then cells were incubated for the indicated periods of time in each experiment. Immunofluorescent Staining—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline(-) for 1 h, and then stained with anti-GFAP antibody (1:50). The primary antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody (1:100). The cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) to identify all nuclei. Plasmids—The reporter plasmid pGF1L, which has the 2.5-kb mouse GFAP promoter connected to the firefly luciferase gene, was kindly provided by Dr. Ikenaka (21Miura M. Tamura T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1180-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid pIL6-Luc was created by subcloning the promoter region of the rat IL-6 gene (-643 to +64) prepared by PCR into the KpnI/HindIII site of a pTAL-Luc vector (Clontech). This promoter region of rat IL-6 bears a cAMP-response element (CRE) consensus sequence, and the highest promoter activity is indicated by stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor in C6 cells (22Franchimont N.

The plasmid structure was verified by sequencing. pEF-BOS-STAT3 (wild-type) and pEF-BOS-STAT3 (Y705), expression vectors for wild-type and dominant-negative forms of STAT3, respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. Akira (23Minami M.

The reporter plasmids bearing a variety of six cis-elements (activator protein 1-binding element, glucocorticoid response element, heat shock response element, serum response element, nuclear factor of κB-binding element (NFκB), and CRE) fused to the firefly luciferase gene were purchased from Clontech. Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts were prepared by ultrasonic treatment as described previously (20Takanaga H. Kunimoto M. Adachi T. Tohyama C. Aoki Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using extraction buffer (20 mm Tris/Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). To detect the phosphoform of STAT3 by Western blotting, cells were lysed using an extraction buffer containing tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor mixture set II (Calbiochem). Representative Western blots from at least three independent experiments are shown in all of the figures. Reporter Gene Assay—C6 cells were plated at 6 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. Sixteen hours after the passage, cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.04 μg of Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid (as an internal transfection efficiency control) by the LipofectAMINE method following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). When STAT3 constructs were cotransfected with 1.0 μg of pGF1L and 0.04 μg of Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid, the total amount of DNA was kept constant at 3.04 μg by supplementing with empty vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were serum-starved and stimulated with Bt2AMP/theophylline. The transfected cells were examined for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). RT-PCR—Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using a QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, 1.5 μg of partially purified poly(A)+ RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript™ First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The PCR was then carried out in a 25-μl reaction mixture that contained 1 μl of the cDNA template, 0.6 μm specific oligonucleotide primer pair, and 1.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). The following oligonucleotides were used as DNA primers: IL-6, 5′-CAGTTGCCTTCTTGGGACTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACAGTGCATCATCGCTGTTC-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3′ (reverse). In addition, the following PCR programs were employed: for IL-6, 25 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 61 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C; and for GAPDH, 16 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 62 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The number of cycles employed for each program had been determined by preliminary experiments, which ensured that the PCR would terminate during the log stage of amplification. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Culture medium from C6 cells treated with Bt2AMP/theophylline were harvested at the indicated points in time. Rat IL-6 protein levels in the culture medium were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using Quantikine M (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative Analysis of Astrocytic Processes—Cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, stained with Coomassie solution (0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 10% acetic acid, and 50% methanol) for 20 min at room temperature and then washed three times with water. Quantitative analysis of astrocytic processes was performed using NeuroZoom software (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA and Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York). For quantitative analysis, isolated cells were selected so that individual processes could be traced. Process lengths were obtained by analyzing at least 100 cells/treatment group from three independent experiments and calculating in each cell body. Statistical Analysis—Differences in the means between the treatment groups were statistically assessed using an analysis of variance followed by the post hoc Tukey test. The differences were considered to be statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. cAMP-dependent STAT3 Activation in C6 Cells—Treatment of C6 cells with Bt2AMP/theophylline greatly elevated GFAP protein expression within 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 1, upper panel). This induction of GFAP increased continuously until 72 h. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of STAT3 on the Tyr705 residue was observed over the same time course as the GFAP induction (Fig. 1, top middle panel). In addition, the expression of STAT3 was moderately increased. Therefore, to investigate the effect of STAT3 activity on GFAP expression, wild-type (ST3-WT) and dominant-negative (ST3-DN) forms of STAT3, which had a Tyr705 to phenylalanine substitution, were introduced to C6 cells. As a result, overexpression of ST3-DN decreased the cAMP-dependent GFAP promoter activity, whereas ST3-WT increased this activity (Fig. 2). These results suggested that STAT3 activity was essential for cAMP-dependent GFAP induction. However, cAMP-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation was not detected until 24 h after treatment (Fig. 1, upper middle panel). This lag in cAMP-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation implied that de novo gene expression was required for its phosphorylation.Fig. 2STAT3 activity was important for cAMP-dependent GFAP promoter activation. C6 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding wild-type STAT3 (ST3-WT) or the dominant-negative form of STAT3 (ST3-DN) in the presence of the reporter plasmid pGF1L. For transfection, the total amount of plasmid DNA was kept constant by supplementing with an empty vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were then either left unstimulated (-) or were stimulated (+) with Bt2AMP/theophylline (cAMP) for 24 h. Each observation of luciferase activity was compared with that of the unstimulated control (leftmost group, cAMP-, empty vector alone). Firefly luciferase activity was compensated by the sea pansy luciferase activity of the cotransfecting Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid. The values represent the mean ± S.D. (n = 3). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***; p < 0.001, compared with the values of the Bt2AMP/theophylline-treated (cAMP+) and empty vector alone transfected group (second left group).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activation of CRE in Early Stage of C6 Differentiation—To screen transcription factor(s) activated during C6 differentiation, we examined the influence of Bt2AMP/theophylline on the activity of a variety of transcription factors by using reporter plasmids bearing six different cis-elements linked to the luciferase gene (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Among these cis-elements, only CRE-mediated transcription was significantly activated by Bt2AMP/theophylline (data not shown). Then the time course of CRE- and GFAP promoter-mediated transcriptional activities were investigated (Fig. 3). Significant activation of CRE-mediated transcription was detected within 1 h after Bt2AMP/theophylline treatment, and activity reached a plateau 12 h after treatment (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, cAMP-dependent GFAP promoter activity was moderately activated for 12 h after the treatment. However, this activity was accelerated between 12 and 24 h after the treatment (Fig. 3B). From these results, it appears likely that CRE-mediated gene expression occurs first and then the translated protein probably leads to activation of the GFAP promoter. Protein Kinase A (PKA) Was Involved in CRE- and GFAP Promoter-mediated Transcription—The transcription factors that bind to the CRE consensus sequence are those of the CREB/ATF family (24Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The activation of CREB/ATF family factors is regulated by several kinases including PKA, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, and p38 (24Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 25De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 343-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the inhibitors of these kinases, a PKA inhibitor, H89, suppressed both CRE- and GFAP promoter-mediated transcriptional activity (Fig. 4). Although the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, had a moderate effect on CRE-mediated transcriptional activity, it had no effect on GFAP promoter activity. The c-Jun amino-terminal kinase inhibitor, SP600125, had no effect on either CRE- or GFAP promoter-mediated transcription. Therefore, PKA is likely to be involved in the cAMP-dependent activation of both CRE- and GFAP promoter-mediated gene expression. We also examined the effects of PKC inhibitors on cAMP-dependent GFAP expression because some PKC isoforms, such as PKCβI, -δ, and -ϵ, have been reported to increase during differentiation (18Yoshimura S. Sakai H. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. Shinoda J. Sakai N. Yamada H. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, was shown to dose dependently attenuate cAMP-dependent GFAP promoter activity (Fig. 4B). Therefore, cAMP-dependent GFAP promoter activity also appeared to be regulated by certain PKC isoforms. IL-6 Induction during C6 Differentiation—What was the gene induced by Bt2AMP/theophylline treatment, and the translated protein-promoted STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent GFAP induction? One candidate gene was the IL-6 gene, the transcription of which by cAMP requires a CRE sequence in its promoter region (26Nagashima A.C. Giacomini D. Castro C.P. Pereda M.P. Renner U. Stalla G.K. Arzt E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 201: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding of IL-6 to its receptor activates the JAK/STAT pathway, thereby stimulating STAT3-mediated gene expression. As expected, the IL-6 gene was induced 1 h after Bt2AMP/theophylline treatment (Fig. 5A), and the rat IL-6 promoter was activated by this treatment (Fig. 5B). In addition, promoter activity was suppressed by H89, suggesting the involvement of PKA in IL-6 induction. The pattern of IL-6 promoter activity inhibited by kinase inhibitors was similar to that of CRE-mediated transcriptional activity inhibited by kinase inhibitors, suggesting that cAMP-dependent IL-6 promoter activation is mediated by the CRE sequence in its promoter. To further investigate the secretion of IL-6, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the protein levels in a cultured medium. We found that IL-6 levels were greatly enhanced from 12 to 24 h after stimulation (Fig. 5C). This IL-6 secretion pattern correlated with the activation of the GFAP promoter (Fig. 3B). Effect of Recombinant IL-6 on GFAP Expression—To confirm the effects of IL-6 on GFAP expression, C6 cells were treated with recombinant rat IL-6. This treatment resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation within 15 min (Fig. 6, upper middle panel, lane 8) and GFAP induction within 12 h (Fig. 6, top panel, lane 12). These data suggest that secreted IL-6 is able to activate STAT3, and this might lead to subsequent GFAP expression. Effect of IL-6-neutralizing Antibody on the Differentiation of C6 Cells—To examine whether cAMP-dependently secreted IL-6 is critical for GFAP expression, IL-6-neutralizing antibody was added to the medium together with the Bt2AMP/theophylline treatment, and then the medium was incubated for 24 h. Treatment with an anti-murine IL-6-neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited GFAP expression (Figs. 7, top panel, and 8, D-F), STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 7, upper middle panel), and GFAP promoter activity (data not shown). These data clearly indicate that the secretion of IL-6 plays a pivotal role in cAMP-induced GFAP expression in C6 cells. IL-6-neutralizing antibody also affected the morphology of these C6 cells (Fig. 8, A-C). Treatment of the cells with Bt2AMP/theophylline changed the cell morphology; cells were no longer flat (Fig. 8A) but rather were spindle-shaped with processes (Fig. 8B). The extension of processes of spindle-shaped cells was significantly attenuated by the addition of IL-6-neutralizing antibody (Figs. 8C and 9A). In addition, spindle-shaped cells decreased, whereas flat-shaped cells increased after treatment with IL-6-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 8C). Treatment of cells with H89 also attenuated the extension of the processes, whereas SP600125 did not (Fig. 9B), validating the involvement of PKA in the differentiation of C6 cells. These results suggested that the IL-6 autocrine mechanism was essential not only for GFAP induction but also for the morphological changes observed in the cells.Fig. 8IL-6-neutralizing antibody inhibited morphological change and expression of GFAP in differentiating C6 cells. C6 cells cultured for 24 h in the absence (A and D) or presence (B, C, E, F) of Bt2AMP/theophylline. Cells were treated with control IgG (A, B, D, E) or 10 μg/ml of IL-6-neutralizing antibody (C and F). Cells were then immunolabeled for GFAP.

For example, IL-6 carries out trophic functions such as ensuring neuronal survival and astrocyte proliferation, and it can also function as a mediator of inflammation and astrogliosis (27Gadient R.A. Otten U.H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has suggested that an essential role is played by IL-6 in the development and differentiation of neural cells (6Nakashima K. Taga T. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 25: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Gadient R.A. Otten U.H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The expression of both IL-6 and its receptor mRNA in the rat central nervous system is increased in the striatum, hippocampus, and the neocortex during postnatal development (28Gadient R.A. Otten U.H. Brain Res. 1994; 637: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The major sites of IL-6 synthesis in the central nervous system are neurons and glial cells (27Gadient R.A. Otten U.H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that the elevation of intracellular cAMP enables C6 cells to provide their own astrocytic differentiation-inducing factor, IL-6. Mature astrocytes are known to secrete IL-6 in response to a large number of ligands; these ligands include IL-1, lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor α, transforming growth factor β, neurotransmitters, and various second messengers (29Van Wagoner N.J. Benveniste E.N. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 100: 124-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Such ligands bring about the activation of intracellular signal-transducing factors, including PKA, PKC, NFκB, and activator protein 1-binding element. In undifferentiated C6 cells, PKA activity is thought to be involved in cAMP-dependent IL-6 induction (Fig. 5). Therefore, PKA seems to play an important part in C6 cell differentiation. However, there remains the possibility that other factors are involved in cAMP-dependent GFAP induction. Although recombinant rat IL-6 has been shown to induce GFAP expression in C6 cells 12 h earlier than in Bt2AMP/theophylline-treated cells (Fig. 6, top panel, compare lane 6 with 12), the level of GFAP protein expression induced by recombinant IL-6 was much lower than that of Bt2AMP/theophylline-induced expression at 24 h after treatment (Fig. 6, top panel, compare lane 7 with 13). This finding implies that recombinant IL-6 alone is not sufficient to elevate GFAP to a level that can be induced by Bt2AMP/theophylline treatment. In addition, the introduction of a dominant-negative form of STAT3 did not completely suppress cAMP-dependent GFAP promoter activity (Fig. 2). Moreover, treatment with IL-6-neutralizing antibody did not completely suppress GFAP protein induction (Fig. 7). Here, we demonstrated that PKC might be involved in GFAP promoter activity (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the induction of cAMP-dependent GFAP appears to be regulated by both autocrine secretion of IL-6 and some PKC isoforms. Anciaux et al. (30Anciaux K. Van Dommelen K. Nicolai S. Van Mechelen E. Slegers H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported previously that cAMP-mediated induction of GFAP was independent of PKA activation in C6 cells. They found that the presence of 1 μm H89 did not suppress the level of Bt2AMP-induced GFAP mRNA 48 h after stimulation. In addition, pretreatment with H89 potentiated Bt2AMP-mediated GFAP protein synthesis. In the present study, the presence of 1 μm H89 in the culture medium suppressed both IL-6 and GFAP promoter activity at 3 and 24 h after stimulation with Bt2AMP/theophylline, respectively (Figs. 5B and 4B, respectively). Taken together, these findings suggest that 1 μm H89 might inhibit cAMP-mediated GFAP induction after a relatively short period of treatment (up to 24 h), whereas 1 μm H89 might promote GFAP expression after longer periods of treatment (after 24 h). Hence, the transcriptional regulation of some genes that are possibly involved in GFAP expression might take place during longer periods of H89 treatment in C6 cells. The treatment of C6 cells with IL-6-neutralizing antibody inhibited GFAP induction (Figs. 7 and 8F) and attenuated the extension of astrocytic processes (Figs. 8C and 9A). This effect of IL-6-neutralizing antibody was similar to that of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, which significantly inhibited cAMP-dependent GFAP induction and attenuated the extension of processes in C6 cells (20Takanaga H. Kunimoto M. Adachi T. Tohyama C. Aoki Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the importance of GFAP accumulation for the induction of cellular morphological changes. Thus, the present findings support those of a previous report demonstrating that the formation of the processes requires GFAP synthesis (31Chen W.J. Liem R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the other hand, even though GFAP expression was induced (Fig. 6, top panel, lane 13), we did not observe any spindle-shaped cells with processes after 24 h of treatment with recombinant IL-6 alone (data not shown). This result implied that recombinant IL-6 alone is not sufficient for the induction of morphological changes among C6 cells. Furthermore, the present findings indicated that such cAMP-dependent morphological changes require additional regulation by other signaling cascades. To date, the experimental observations suggest that the following signaling cascade is operative in cAMP-dependent C6 differentiation (Fig. 10). First, Bt2AMP/theophylline treatment elevates intracellular cAMP levels. The cAMP molecules then activate PKA, which stimulates CRE-binding protein to bind to the IL-6 gene promoter and activate its expression. IL-6 protein is secreted and binds to its receptor on the cell surface, which triggers the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that leads to the activation of the tyrosine kinase, JAK. Then activated JAK phosphorylates STAT3, which subsequently translocates into the nucleus and binds to its specific DNA sequence in the GFAP promoter. This in turn leads to the induction of the GFAP gene. The second messenger cAMP regulates multiple signaling cascades and plays a large variety of roles in the living body. Every type of cell in the central nervous system shows peculiar reactions to elevations in intracellular cAMP. Therefore, the cAMP-elevating stimuli that are required for astrocyte differentiation must be strictly regulated during neural development. One such candidate is a neuropeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, which promotes astrocytogenesis in vitro; the pattern of expression of its receptor appears to indicate its relationship to gliogenesis. C6 cells are known to display astrocytic, oligodendrocytic, and neuronal characteristics (32Parker K.K. Norenberg M.D. Vernadakis A. Science. 1980; 208: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 33Segovia J. Lawless G.M. Tillakaratne N.J. Brenner M. Tobin A.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains unknown whether or not the secretion of IL-6 from undifferentiated C6 cells is characteristic of astrocyte-lineage cells. Thus, further study will be required to identify the type(s) of neural cells that provide IL-6 during astrocytogenesis. Based on the results of present study, we propose that an important function of cAMP in the developing central nervous system is to induce IL-6 secretion from neural cells; this process is thought to play an essential role in the promotion of astrocytogenesis.

Since the –1013 to –1002 region of the TGF-β1 promoter shows high homology to glucose-response elements (GlRE) formerly described in genes involved in glucose metabolism, we studied the function of the GlRE in the high glucose-induced TGF-β1 gene activation in mesangial cells. We found that high glucose concentrations enhanced the nuclear amount of upstream stimulatory factors (USF) and their binding to this sequence. Fusion of the GlRE to the thymidine kinase promoter resulted in glucose responsiveness of this promoter construct. Overexpression of either USF-1 or USF-2 increased TGF-β1 promoter activity 2-fold, which was prevented by mutation or deletion of the GlRE. The high glucose-induced activation of the GlRE is mediated by the HBP; increased flux through the HBP induced by high glucose concentrations, by glutamine, or by overexpression of the rate-limiting enzyme glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (GFAT) particularly activated USF-2 expression. GFAT-overexpressing cells showed higher USF binding activity to the GlRE and enhanced promoter activation via the GlRE. Increasing O-GlcNAc modification of proteins by streptozotocin, thereby mimicking HBP activation, also resulted in increased mRNA and nuclear protein levels of USF-2, leading to enhanced DNA binding activity to the GlRE. USF proteins themselves were not found to be O-GlcNAc-modified.

Moreover, increased synthesis of amino sugars through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) has also been implicated in hyperglycemia-induced TGF-β1 synthesis (15Kolm-Litty V. Sauer U. Nerlich A.

The HBP has been implicated in increased promoter activity of genes under high glucose conditions (20Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W.

The product glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) is very rapidly further converted and activated to UDP-GlcNAc, the substrate of an O-GlcNAc transferase that modifies serine and threonine residues of cytosolic and nuclear proteins with a single monosaccharide O-GlcNAc group (20Wells L.

However, the identification of the HBP-response elements in the TGF-β1 promoter region and of the involved transcription factors remains open. Examination of the human TGF-β1 promoter region by computer analysis for transcription factor binding sites revealed that the region –1013 to –1002 (CACGTGGCGGCC) shows high homology to consensus motifs in the promoters of the liver pyruvate kinase (L-PK), the S14, and the fatty acid synthase gene, which refer to the glucose responsiveness of these genes, and are therefore called carbohydrate or glucose-response elements (GlRE) (25Shih H.M.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2640-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Among the proteins that were reported to possess GlRE DNA binding activity are members of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors, the upstream stimulatory factors (USF), which bind to the E-box motifs in the GlRE (25Shih H.M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J.

The current studies were initiated to examine the function of the GlRE sequence in the TGF-β1 promoter and to characterize the nuclear proteins that bind to this region. Furthermore, we investigated the hypothesis that the GlRE and GlRE DNA-binding proteins could be the link between the high glucose-induced activation of the HBP and the resulting enhanced TGF-β1 gene expression. We found enhanced binding of an USF-1 and -2 heterodimer to the GlRE in nuclear extracts obtained from high glucose-stimulated mesangial cells. Expression of either USF-1 or USF-2 induced TGF-β1 promoter activity 2-fold with no additive effect in the presence of both USF proteins. Mutation or deletion of the GlRE prevented the USF-induced promoter activation almost completely. Increased flux through the HBP stimulated by high glucose or glutamine, by overexpression of GFAT, or enhancement of O-glycosylation by streptozotocin (STZ) predominantly activated the expression of USF-2, although USF proteins were not a direct target of O-GlcNAc modification. Thus, activation of the HBP, via elevated O-glycosylation activity, enhanced nuclear USF protein levels, and increased binding of USF proteins to the GlRE, up-regulates TGF-β1 promoter activity.

Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Mesangial cells isolated from porcine glomeruli were cultured and characterized as described previously (15Kolm-Litty V. Sauer U. Nerlich A. Lehmann R. Schleicher E.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 15% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 3mm glutamine, non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 μg/ml minocyclin, and 10 mm glucose. For experiments, RPMI 1640 containing 5.5 mm glucose and 3 mm glutamine was used, and fetal calf serum was substituted by 2% Ultroser. Mouse SV40 mesangial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5.5 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 4 mm glutamine, non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For equal osmolarity in the high glucose experiments, NaCl was added to control cells. Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—SV40 mesangial cells and porcine mesangial cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 according to the instructions of the supplier. One day prior to transfection, 0.2 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 12-well plates with 1 ml of experimental medium. For one well, 1.5 μl of FuGENE 6 and 0.5 μg of total DNA were diluted in serum-free medium, and after 15 min, added to the cells. Glucose was added prior to transfection. Cells were harvested after 40 h. For normalization of transfection efficiencies, we cotransfected pRL-TK vector in porcine mesangial cells. Separate cell extracts of SV40 mesangial cells were obtained from triplicate wells to monitor the reproducibility of the transfection efficiency (replicates generally varied by <10% in luciferase activity). Transfected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 150 μl of lysis buffer from the dual luciferase assay for 15 min, and harvested. Firefly and sea pansy luciferase activities were determined according to the instructions of the dual luciferase assay using Magic Lite analyzer from Ciba Corning (Fernwald, Germany). All transfection experiments were repeated at least three times. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—For preparation of nuclear extracts, 6.0 × 106 porcine mesangial cells were seeded onto 15-cm culture dishes and cultured in 15 ml of experimental medium. Cells were incubated with 5.5 or 30 mm glucose or STZ for the indicated time points before harvesting. Nuclear proteins were prepared as described (30Netzker R. Weigert C. Brand K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Cellular extracts were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide (7.5%) gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by semidry electroblotting (transfer buffer: 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.0375% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% (v/v) methanol). The nitrocellulose membranes were then blocked with NET buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.25% gelatin) and incubated with the first antibody (diluted 1:1000 in NET) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with NET buffer, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG for 1 h at room temperature. Visualization of immunocomplexes was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence as described previously (13Weigert C. Sauer U. Brodbeck K. Pfeiffer A. Haering H.U. Schleicher E.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 2007-2016PubMed Google Scholar). India ink staining was performed as described in Ref. 31Hancock K. Tsang V.C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Synthetic oligonucleotides containing human TGF-β1 sequence –1019 to –996 GlRE (CTGCCCCACGTGGCGGCCCCTGGG) or GlREmut (CTGCCCCATATGGCGGCCCCTGGG), in which the mutated sequence is bold and underlined or containing a high affinity binding site for Sp1 (AGCCGGGGAGCCCGCCCCCTTTCCCCCAGGGCTG) were end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mm) and Klenow enzyme and were incubated with up to 6 μg of nuclear protein in 20 μl of 7 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 3.6 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol on ice for 20 min. 0.05 mg/ml poly[d(I-C)] was added as unspecific competitor. The samples were run on a 5% non-denaturating polyacrylamide gel in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 190 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. RT-PCR and Real-time Quantitative PCR Analysis—Reverse transcription of total RNA (1 μg) was performed using random hexamers and the first strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR. Aliquots (2 μl) of the reverse transcription reactions were then submitted in triplicate to online quantitative PCR with the Light Cycler system using the FastStart DNA-MasterSYBR Green I. The PCR reaction was optimized for Mg2+ concentration and annealing temperature. Initial real-time amplifications were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining to verify that the primer pairs amplified a single product of the predicted size. Subsequent aliquots of the PCR reaction where checked by melting curve analysis as provided by the Light Cycler system. The porcine USF-1 primers (sense, 5′-ggtggaattctgtccaaagc-3′; antisense, 5′-gctggtagcagcagattcttg-3′) and USF-2 primers (sense, 5′-cagtaccagttccgcacaga-3′; antisense, 5′-acacccacctgggtcacag-3′) amplified a product of 161 and 164 bp, respectively. The mouse USF-1 primers (sense, 5′-agctgttgttaccacccagg-3′; antisense, 5′-tatgttgagccctccgtttc-3′) and USF-2 primers (sense, 5′-ctacagcagcacaacctgga-3′; antisense, 5′-tgggcaacgtatcaacagaa-3′) amplified a product of 202 and 206 bp, respectively. The PCR was performed in a volume of 20 μl as follows: 2 μl of FastStart DNA-MasterSYBR Green I, MgCl2 3 mmol/liter, and primers according to a primer concentration of 1 μmol/liter. The instrument settings were as follows: denaturing was at 95 °C for 10 min, cycling was performed by denaturing at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing was at 68 °C for 5 s, and elongation was performed for 8 s; the number of cycles was 45. Quantification was performed by online monitoring for identification of the exact time point at which the logarithmic linear phase was distinguishable from the background. Serially diluted samples obtained by PCR with the above mentioned primers from wild type rat mesangial cells were used as external standards in each run. The cycle numbers of the logarithmic linear phase were plotted against the logarithm of the concentration of the template DNA, and the concentration of cDNA in the different samples was calculated with the Light Cycler software (version 5.32). Statistical Analysis—Results presented are derived from at least three independent experiments. Means ± S.E. were calculated, and groups of data were compared using student's t test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. High Glucose Stimulates Binding of Nuclear Proteins USF-1 and USF-2 to the GlRE—To characterize the TGF-β1 promoter region –1013/–1002 as a glucose-response element, the binding of nuclear proteins from normal and high glucose-treated porcine mesangial cells to this region was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Incubation with 30 mm ambient high glucose for 15 h induced the DNA binding activity to the –1013/–1002-containing sequence, and this effect was enhanced after 40 h of high glucose stimulation and persisted for at least 72 h (Fig. 1A). The specificity of the binding was tested by using 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled GlRE oligonucleotide, which prevented the DNA binding completely, whereas 30-fold molar excess of the mutated GlRE does not (Fig. 1B, lane 2 and 3). Moreover, no binding to the radiolabeled mutated GlRE was detected (Fig. 1B, lane 4). To identify the transcription factors that bind to the TGF-β1 GlRE sequence, antibodies against USF-1 and USF-2 were added to the binding reaction. With either antibody, the GlRE-protein complex was completely supershifted, leading to distinct new bands with lower mobility (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, addition of an anti-Sp1 antibody did not affect the mobility of the GlRE-protein complex (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Thus, USF-1 and USF-2 are identified as major components and proved to be essential for the nuclear DNA binding activity to the GlRE. High Glucose Stimulates Promoter Activation via the GlRE— The functional activity of the TGF-β1 promoter GlRE was studied as the ability of this promoter region to confer high glucose responsiveness to a different promoter. Fusion of the TGF-β1 promoter region –1022/–993 to the thymidine kinase promoter (Fig. 2A), which alone is not activated by high glucose concentrations in porcine mesangial cells (Fig. 2B, TK), led to a 1.5-fold induction of GlRE-TK promoter activity after 24 h of high glucose stimulation (Fig. 2B). Thus, the TGF-β1 promoter region –1022/–993 is a functionally active and independent GlRE. Expression of USF Proteins Enhances TGF-β1 Promoter Activity—To investigate whether high glucose-induced binding of USF to the GlRE can enhance TGF-β1 promoter activity, SV40 mesangial cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for USF-1 and/or USF-2 and TGF-β1 promoter constructs in pGL3basic in 5.5 mm ambient glucose concentrations. In these experiments, we used SV40 mesangial cells since the transfection efficiency obtained with porcine mesangial cells, although suitable to perform luciferase reporter gene assays, is not sufficient to investigate the effect of transfected proteins. In transfected SV40 mesangial cells, expression levels of USF-1 and USF-2 were high as measured by Western blotting with specific antibodies (Fig. 3A), thus leading subsequently to enhanced binding to the GlRE (data not shown). The nuclear amount of the transcription factor c-Jun was essentially unchanged in USF-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Promoter activity of the co-transfected –1065/+11 TGF-β1 promoter region (Fig. 3B) increased by either enhanced USF-1 or enhanced USF-2 levels 1.5–2.0-fold with no additive effect in the presence of elevated concentrations of both USF proteins (Fig. 3C). Mutation of the GlRE, which abrogates USF protein binding as demonstrated by EMSA (Fig. 1B), clearly reduces the effect of USF overexpression on TGF-β1 promoter activation (Fig. 3C). Remaining weak stimulation by USF-1 could possibly be mediated by a second putative USF binding site at position –877/–872. Accordingly, transfection of expression vectors for USF-1 and USF-2 showed no effect on a cotransfected –453/+11 TGF-β1 promoter construct lacking both USF binding sequences (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that elevated levels of USF-1 and USF-2 cause TGF-β1 promoter activation via the GlRE. Activation of the HBP Induce mRNA Expression of USF-2— Next, we investigated the underlying mechanism responsible for the high glucose-enhanced DNA binding of USF proteins to the GlRE.

https://openalex.org/W1974657780,"In this study, we generated three SAGE libraries from melanoma tissues. Using bioinformatics tools usually applied to microarray data, we identified several genes, including novel transcripts, which are preferentially expressed in melanoma. SAGE results converged with previous microarray analysis on the importance of intracellular calcium and G-protein signaling, and the Wnt/Frizzled family. We also examined the expression of CD74, which was specifically, albeit not abundantly, expressed in the melanoma libraries using a melanoma progression tissue microarray, and demonstrate that this protein is expressed by melanoma cells but not by benign melanocytes. Many genes involved in intracellular calcium and G-protein signaling were highly expressed in melanoma, results we had observed earlier from microarray studies (Bittner et al., 2000). One of the genes most highly expressed in our melanoma SAGE libraries was a calcium-regulated gene, calpain 3 (p94). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that calpain 3 moves from the nuclei of non-neoplastic cells to the cytoplasm of malignant cells, suggesting activation of this intracellular proteinase. Our SAGE results and the clinical validation data demonstrate how SAGE profiles can highlight specific links between signaling pathways as well as associations with tumor progression. This may provide insights into new genes that may be useful for the diagnosis and therapy of melanoma."

At the KN-93 arrest point, we found that cyclin D1/cdk4 complexes had assembled with p21/p27, accumulated in the nucleus, and become phosphorylated on Thr-172, yet were relatively inactive. Additional examination of cdk4 complexes by gel filtration analysis demonstrated that, in late G1, cyclin D1-containing complexes migrated toward lower molecular weight (Mr) fractions and this altered migration was accompanied by the appearance of two peaks of cdk4 activity, at 150-200 and 70 kDa, respectively. KN-93 prevented both the activation of cdk4, and this shift in cyclin D1 migration and overexpression of cyclin D1/cdk4 overcame the KN-93 arrest. To determine which multifunctional CaMK acts in G1, we expressed kinase-deficient forms of CaMKI and CaMKII. Overexpression of kinase-deficient CaMKI, but not CaMKII, prevented cdk4 activation, mimicking the KN-93 arrest point.

Treatment of a number of asynchronously cycling mammalian cells with the selective multifunctional calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) inhibitor KN-93 results in a G1 arrest. In HeLa cells, Rasmussen and Rasmussen (2Rasmussen G. Rasmussen C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) demonstrated that KN-93 treatment results in a G1 arrest, which was accompanied by elevation of p13 precipitable H1 kinase activity, implying the arrest was downstream of cdk2 activation. Additionally, KN-93 arrests both asynchronous and mitogen-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells in G1 (3Morris T.A. DeLorenzo R.J. Tombes R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 4Tombes R.M. Grant S. Westin E.H. Krystal G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1063-1070PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the HeLa cell experiments, this G1 arrest was characterized by a reduction in both cdk4 and cdk2 activity (3Morris T.A. DeLorenzo R.J. Tombes R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results raise the question as to why KN-93 induces distinct biochemical arrests points in different cell types. One possibility is that the multifunctional CaMKs act at multiple distinct points in G1, both upstream and downstream of cdk activation. Another possibility is that the degree of cell immortalization or transformation affects the nature of the KN-93 arrest point. Indeed, in several cell types, transformation reduces the requirements of Ca2+ and CaM for cell proliferation (5Ye Q. Wei Y. Fischer R. Borner C. Berchtold M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1359: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 6Whitfield J.F. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1992; 3: 55-90PubMed Google Scholar, 7Boynton A.L. Whitfield J.F. Isaacs R.J. Tremblay R.G. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 2657-2661PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, transformation may also reduce the requirement for CaMK function at certain cell cycle transitions. Here, we used normal diploid fibroblasts, which are unlikely to have disruptions in Ca2+/CaM-dependent pathways, to investigate the role of CaMK in G1 progression following serum stimulation. Similar to both HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells, KN-93 arrested WI-38 cells in G1. This arrest was characterized by dramatically reduced cdk2 and cdk4 activity, similar to the result from NIH 3T3 cells. The downstream cell cycle target of the KN-93 arrest was the cyclin D/cdk4 complex since overexpression of cyclin D/cdk4 alone was sufficient to overcome the KN-93 arrest. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a biochemically similar G1 arrest was induced by expression of kinase-deficient CaMKI, but not CaMKII, implying that CaMKI activity is required for proper activation of cyclin D/cdk4 complexes during G1 progression in human diploid fibroblasts. Cell Culture and Reagents—WI-38 fibroblasts were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository (National Institute on Aging, Repository AG06814F) at passage 14. Cells were grown according to their guidelines in Eagle's MEM with Earle's salts supplemented with MEM non-essential amino acids, MEM vitamins, l-glutamine, and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For experiments, cells were plated at ∼5000 cells/cm2 and grown overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. To arrest cells with low serum, they were washed two times with Puck's solution followed by the addition of medium containing 0.2% FBS for 26-32 h. All cell culture media and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc. FBS was obtained from Sigma, Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc., or Hyclone, and each time a new lot of serum was used cells were tested to ensure similar growth parameters. KN-93, KN-92, and W-13 were obtained from RBI/Sigma or Seikagaiku. Flow Cytometry and BrdU Incorporation—For flow cytometry, 0.5-1.0 × 106 cells were trypsinized, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS and 800 μl of ethanol. Cells were fixed overnight at -20 °C and resuspended in 0.5-1.0 ml of DNA Prep (Beckman/Coulter). Samples were analyzed using an EPICS Profile II and EXPO software analysis program (Beckman/Coulter). To assay BrdU incorporation by immunofluorescence, cells were plated onto coverslips or glass chamber slides (Becton Dickinson) and pulse-labeled with 10 μm BrdU for 30 min. Cells were fixed with cold methanol for 5 min at 4 °C followed by permeabilization with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Samples were denatured with 2 n HCl for 30 min, washed once with 0.1 m Na2B4O7 and twice with PBS, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Anti-BrdU (Beckman/Coulter) was diluted to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times with PBS, followed by incubation for 60 min with goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution. Samples were then washed three times with PBS, then incubated with DAPI (5 mg/ml stock) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS for 5 min, and mounted under coverslips using a solution of 25 mg/ml triethylenediamine in 50% glycerol, and 50% PBS. For each sample, 500-700 cells were counted at random and S phase percentage was determined by dividing the number of BrdU-positive nuclei by DAPI-positive nuclei. Assays of Cdk Activity—Cdk2 assays were carried out based on protocols described by DeGregori et al. (8DeGregori J. Leone G. Ohtani K. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2873-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and Sheaff (9Sheaff R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in Cdk2 IP/radioimmune precipitation assay buffer described by DeGregori et al., and protein concentration was determined using DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). For each sample, 500 μg of total protein was immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of anti-cdk2 (M2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). The final kinase reaction was carried out in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi per reaction of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 5 μg per reaction histone H1 (Roche Applied Science). Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer to stop the reaction, after which they were boiled and the proteins separated by electrophoresis. The amount of 32P-labeled histone H1 was evaluated by autoradiography. Cdk4 kinase assays were carried out based on protocols described by DeGregori et al. (8DeGregori J. Leone G. Ohtani K. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2873-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and Phelps and Xiong (10Phelps D.E. Xiong Y. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in Cdk4 IP Buffer described by DeGregori et al., and protein concentration was determined using DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). For each sample, 500 μg of total protein was immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of anti-cdk4 (C-22 or H-22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). The final kinase reaction was carried out in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na2VO4, 1 mm NaF, 20 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi per reaction of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 2 μg per reaction GST-Rb 769-921 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and processed as described above for the cdk2 assays. The amount of 32P-labeled GST-Rb was evaluated by autoradiography and quantified using PhosphorImager and ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. Western Analyses and Immunoprecipitation—Following lysis in Cdk4 IP buffer, samples were assayed for protein concentration and 50-100 μg of protein (depending on assay) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. For most Western blots, proteins were separated by 10-12% SDS-PAGE, but for retinoblastoma protein (pRb) analysis, 6% SDS-PAGE was used in order to ensure separation of the phosphorylated forms. Following gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore) based on the manufacturer's recommendations for the electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1-2 h in Blocking Solution (TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, 5% dry milk, and 0.5% fish gelatin). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted at 1:1000 (primary) or 1:5000 (secondary) in Blocking Solution and incubated either at 4 °C overnight or at room temperature for 60 min with rocking. Signal was detected by chemiluminescence with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies included anti-Rb (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin D1 (H-295, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin D1 (UBI), anti-cdk4 (C-22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cdk4 (H-22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cdk2 (M2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CaMKI (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CaMKIV (Transduction Laboratories/BD Biosciences), anti-p21 (UBI), anti-p27 (BD Biosciences), anti-phospho-ThrPro (Cell Signaling). The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, and rabbit anti-goat (Jackson). Quantification of pRb Westerns were performed with Personal Densitometer SI and ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. For immunoprecipitations, WI-38 cells were lysed in Cdk4 IP buffer and normalized by total cell number and/or total protein concentration. Cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated using 2-4 μg of anti-cdk4 (C-22 or H-22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 10-20 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) depending on the experiment. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western analyses as described above. Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescent microscopy, cells were plated in 4-well glass chamber slides (BD Biosciences) and cultured as described previously. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 50% methanol and 50% acetone for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min followed by incubation with the primary antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 60-90 min at room temperature. As a negative control, normal IgG from the same species was used at protein concentrations equivalent to the primary antibody. After washing, samples were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Samples were washed three times with PBS, then incubated with DAPI (5 mg/ml stock) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS for 5 min. Samples were mounted with coverslips using a solution of 25 mg/ml triethylenediamine in 50% glycerol and 50% PBS and stored at -20 °C until viewing. Gel Filtration Chromatography—To analyze cdk4 and its associated proteins based on molecular weight (Mr), WI-38 extracts were separated by gel filtration chromatography as described previously (11Warner B.J. Blain S.W. Seoane J. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Obaya A.J. Kotenko I. Cole M.D. Sedivy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31263-31269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The void volume and separation of proteins based on Mr of a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) was determined using blue dextran and a series of standard proteins ranging in Mr from 29 to 669 kDa (Sigma). The column was equilibrated with column buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) for Western analyses or with Cdk4 IP buffer (lacking aprotinin) for cdk4 IP kinase assays. WI-38 cell lysates, in Cdk4 IP buffer, were centrifuged for 12 min at 4 °C followed by ultracentrifugation in the TLA 100.1 rotor in an Optima TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman) at 50,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Approximately 250 μl of cleared lysate was injected into the column at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and then used for Western analyses (1/10 fraction) and cdk4 IP kinase assays (0.4 ml). The amount of total cdk4 activity recovered from fractions 6-20 was about 40% of the input. Adenoviral Infection of Cells—All adenoviruses were generated using the AdEasy system first described by He and colleagues and now available from Qbiogene (32He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). The methods used to generate these viruses were based on the initial description of the system, the website with updated protocols and sequence data (www.coloncancer.org/adeasy/protocol.htm), and the protocols published by Qbiogene (formerly, Quantum Biotechnologies). WI-38 cells were routinely infected as described by others (8DeGregori J. Leone G. Ohtani K. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2873-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32He T.C.

Similar cloning schemes were used for human CaMKI wild type and its kinase-deficient mutant, CaMKI K49A. CaMKI in pGEX-2T was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into pSP72 (Promega). The resultant vector, CaMKI → pSP72, was digested with SalI and EcoRV and ligated into pAdTrack-CMV. Similar cloning schemes were used for rat CaMKIIα and its kinase-deficient mutant, CaMKIIα K42M. CaMKIIα in pRSV was digested with XhoI and XbaI and ligated into pAdTrack-CMV. Adenovirus constructs encoding cyclin D1 and cdk4 were generous gifts of Marco Crescenzi (13Latella L. Sacco A. Pajalunga D. Tiainen M. Macera D. D'Angelo M. Felici A. Sacchi A. Crescenzi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5631-5643Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Reversible Inhibition of Late G1 Progression by KN-93—Ca2+/CaM is required in both early and late G1 and pharmacological inhibition of CaMK function arrests mammalian cells in G1 (1Kahl C.R. Means A.R. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated calcineurin to be required in early G1 to ensure the proper cyclin D1 accumulation in normal diploid fibroblasts, and hypothesized that one or more CaMKs may regulate late G1 progression. Using WI-38 cells, we investigated the requirement for CaMK function during cell cycle reentry from a serum-starved state. Similar to results in HeLa and NIH-3T3 cells (2Rasmussen G. Rasmussen C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3Morris T.A. DeLorenzo R.J. Tombes R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 4Tombes R.M. Grant S. Westin E.H. Krystal G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1063-1070PubMed Google Scholar), KN-93, a selective inhibitor of the multifunctional CaMKs, arrested WI-38 cells in G1 following serum stimulation while KN-92, a much less potent analog of KN-93, had no effect on reentry profiles (Fig. 1A). The KN-93 arrest was rapidly reversible with a large number of cells having progressed to G2/M by 6 h after KN-93 removal (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with our idea that the KN-93 arrest was likely to occur in late G1. To further evaluate this result, we added KN-93 at increasing times following serum addition and determined the amount of BrdU incorporation at peak S phase, about 18 h for WI-38 cells (Fig. 1C). As expected for a late G1 arrest, KN-93 caused a dramatic reduction in the number of S phase cells when it was added as late as 8 h after serum addition. In summary, KN-93 induced a late G1 arrest in WI-38 fibroblasts, implicating one or more of the multifunctional CaMKs in a signaling pathway required for the late stages of G1 progression. Inhibition of G1 Cdk Activity by KN-93—Since KN-93 has been reported to affect the activity of the cdks in G1 (2Rasmussen G. Rasmussen C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3Morris T.A. DeLorenzo R.J. Tombes R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we evaluated the activation status of two G1 cdks, cdk2, and cdk4, in WI-38 cells arrested in G1 with KN-93. Cdk2 kinase complexes were immunoprecipitated and assayed for activity using histone H1 as a substrate. In control cells, cdk2 activity was evident by 16 h after serum addition and was markedly increased at 20 h (Fig. 2A). Cells treated with KN-93 demonstrated little or no cdk2 activity at either 16 or 20 h. Because there was such little activity, we did not evaluate the relative contributions of cyclin E/cdk2 and cyclin A/cdk2 to the total cdk2 activity. Since cdk4 activity is required prior to cdk2 activity during normal G1 progression, we analyzed cdk4 activity by immunoprecipitating cdk4 kinase complexes followed by kinase assays using GST-Rb as an in vitro substrate. Although control cells demonstrated cdk4 activity at 18 h after serum addition, cells treated with KN-93 had profoundly reduced activity at the same time point (Fig. 2B). As an in vivo monitor of cdk4 activity, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of endogenous pRb protein by Western analysis (Fig. 2C). In contrast to serum-starved cells, which exhibit a single immunoreactive band for hypophosphorylated pRb, serum-stimulated cells demonstrated a shifted, hyperphosphorylated pRb and an increase in total pRb. KN-93-treated cells contained both forms of pRb, but at extremely reduced levels. The presence of some hyperphosphorylated pRb probably reflects the low, but detectable, amount of cdk4 activity that exists in the presence of KN-93. Because Morris et al. (3Morris T.A. DeLorenzo R.J. Tombes R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) found that KN-93 prevented cyclin D1 accumulation, and thus prevented cdk4 activation in NIH-3T3 cells, we examined the expression of cyclin D1. In contrast to results in NIH-3T3 cells, KN-93 did not affect the accumulation of cyclin D1 or cdk4 in WI-38 cells (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, we found that both KN-93 and W-13, a CaM antagonist, had similar effects on G1 cdk activities and pRb phosphorylation, and our results using W-13 were similar to previously published results for WI-38 cells (14Takuwa N. Zhou W. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Takuwa N. Zhou W. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 138-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, KN-93 arrested WI-38 cells in late G1 with dramatically reduced cdk4 activity and this G1 arrest was distinct from the arrest previously reported in NIH-3T3 cells since cyclin D1 levels were unchanged. Alteration of Cdk4 Complex Formation in the Presence of KN-93—Since cdk4 activity is regulated by cyclin binding, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) binding, subcellular localization, and phosphorylation status, we evaluated each of these components in KN-93-treated cells (16Ekholm S.V. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 17Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 18Ortega S. Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 19Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar, 20Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). First, cdk4 activity requires complex formation with the D type cyclins and in WI-38 cells, the most abundant complex was found to be cyclin D1/cdk4 (21Parry D. Mahony D. Wills K. Lees E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Using antibodies to immunoprecipitate cdk4 complexes, we found similar amounts of both cyclin D1 and cdk4 in the complexes in either the presence or absence of KN-93 (Fig. 3A). Parallel experiments were conducted using cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates with similar results (data not shown). A second regulator of cdk4 activation is association with CKIs of either the p15/p16 family or p21/p27 family. The p15/p16, or INK4 proteins, have been shown to bind cdk4 competitively with cyclin D resulting in dimeric, inactive kinase complexes (16Ekholm S.V. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 18Ortega S. Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 19Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). Because the amount of cyclin D1-bound cdk4 is similar in KN-93-treated or untreated cells, we reasoned it was unlikely that cdk4 was inactive due to inhibition by INK4 binding. In contrast to the INK4 proteins, p21/p27 proteins are required for proper assembly and nuclear entry of cdk4 complexes (16Ekholm S.V. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 18Ortega S. Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 19Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). We analyzed cdk4 immunoprecipitates for p21 and p27, and found similar levels of both proteins in KN-93-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 3B). Following its assembly with cyclin D, cdk4 requires phosphorylation of Thr-172 by the nuclear enzyme, CAK, for full activation. As a phosphospecific antibody to this site on cdk4 is not available, we evaluated Thr phosphorylation of cdk4 by immunoprecipitating cdk4 and probing with an antibody against a phospho-Thr-Pro epitope, as Thr-172 is followed by Pro in cdk4. This was possible because mutational analysis showed that Thr-172 is the only Thr residue phosphorylated in cdk4 (22Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Strom D.K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2713-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In cdk4 immunoprecipitates from WI-38 cells, the antibody recognized a single band that comigrated with cdk4 (Fig. 3C). KN-93-treated cell lysates had immunoreactivity similar to untreated cell lysates. We used cyclosporin A-treated cell extracts, which show no immunoreactivity, as a control sample in which we knew that cdk4 was not bound to cyclin D, and therefore presumed cdk4 would be unphosphorylated. In conclusion, KN-93 neither prevented the assembly of cdk4 complexes containing cyclin D1 or p21/p27 nor the subsequent activating phosphorylation by CAK. Although CAK is a nuclear enzyme, immunofluorescence microscopy was used to confirm that cyclin D1/cdk4 was localized in the nucleus of KN-93-treated cells. In untreated and KN-93-treated cells, the relative number of cells with nuclear cyclin D1 was similar (Fig. 3D). Parallel experiments using antibodies to cdk4 demonstrated equivalent results (data not shown). Although these experiments could not rule out an alteration in the kinetics of nuclear import or export, they demonstrated that cyclin D1/cdk4 complexes accumulated in the nucleus but were relatively inactive. Finally, it has also been reported that UV irradiation promotes Tyr phosphorylation of cdk4 on an inhibitory site (23Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Jinno S. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 376: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We have been unable to detect any Tyr phosphorylation by Western analysis in cdk4 immunoprecipitates from WI-38 cells, so conclude that Tyr phosphorylation of cdk4 is unlikely to be the mechanism by which cdk4 remains inactive in KN-93-treated cells (data not shown). Collectively, our data suggest that KN-93 prevented a novel step required for activation of cdk4 complexes even though cyclin D/cdk4/p21 assembly, nuclear localization, and activating phosphorylation occur normally. Because we ruled out the major known regulators of cdk4 activation as targets for the KN-93 arrest, we evaluated cdk4 complexes using gel filtration chromatography (11Warner B.J. Blain S.W. Seoane J. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Obaya A.J. Kotenko I. Cole M.D. Sedivy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31263-31269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In general, cdk4 has been suggested to partition between 3 major complexes: a large (∼450 kDa) chaperone complex with hsp90 and cdc37; an intermediate size (∼150 kDa) active complex with cyclin D and p21; and, a small (∼50 kDa) inactive complex with an INK4 protein (19Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). Importantly, the cdk4 immunoprecipitates from whole cell lysates actually contain a complex mixture of all these diverse cdk4 complexes, and it has been shown that only a small fraction of the total cdk4 exhibits kinase activity. To evaluate the relative amounts of these cdk4 complexes in cells, we fractionated WI-38 cell lysates by gel filtration chromatography followed by Western analysis of cdk4 and its binding partners. Whereas, the overall distribution of cdk4 in the fractions was similar in the presence or absence of KN-93, we did identify differences in the migration patterns of cyclin D1 (Fig. 4A). At 12 h after serum addition, in late G1, cyclin D1 was present primarily in fractions around 150 kDa, which was expected based on previous data that active cdk4/cyclin D1/p21 complexes were found in this region. However, at 16 h, cyclin D1 had shifted into lower Mr fractions that span the region from 150 to 60 kDa. In the presence of KN-93 for 16 h, the distribution of cyclin D1 was strikingly similar to that found at 12 h in the absence of the inhibitor, with cyclin D1 limited to fractions around 150 kDa. Because we detected a change in cyclin D1 fractionation patterns in extracts from cells"
https://openalex.org/W2050816574,"N-Linked glycosylation is a post-translational event whereby carbohydrates are added to secreted proteins at the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr, where Xaa is any amino acid except proline. Some consensus sequences in secreted proteins are not glycosylated, indicating that consensus sequences are necessary but not sufficient for glycosylation. In order to understand the structural rules for N-linked glycosylation, we introduced N-linked consensus sequences by site-directed mutagenesis into the polypeptide chain of the recombinant human erythropoietin molecule. Some regions of the polypeptide chain supported N-linked glycosylation more effectively than others. N-Linked glycosylation was inhibited by an adjacent proline suggesting that sequence context of a consensus sequence could affect glycosylation. One N-linked consensus sequence (Asn123-Thr125) introduced into a position close to the existing O-glycosylation site (Ser126) had an additional O-linked carbohydrate chain and not an additional N-linked carbohydrate chain suggesting that structural requirements in this region favored O-glycosylation over N-glycosylation. The presence of a consensus sequence on the protein surface of the folded molecule did not appear to be a prerequisite for oligosaccharide addition. However, it was noted that recombinant human erythropoietin analogs that were hyperglycosylated at sites that were normally buried had altered protein structures. This suggests that carbohydrate addition precedes polypeptide folding. N-Linked glycosylation is a post-translational event whereby carbohydrates are added to secreted proteins at the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr, where Xaa is any amino acid except proline.

This suggests that carbohydrate addition precedes polypeptide folding. Secreted proteins are often glycosylated during transit through the secretory apparatus in eukaryotic cells. These carbohydrates can be attached to the hydroxyl group on a serine or threonine (O-linked glycosylation) or the amine of an asparagine via an N-glycosidic bond (N-linked glycosylation). The addition of carbohydrate chains to the polypeptide backbone of a protein may have an impact on the structure, solubility, antigenicity, folding, secretion, and stability of the protein (1Hounsell E.F.

Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar).The nature of the signal for carbohydrate addition is partially understood. N-Linked carbohydrate addition is mediated by oligosaccharide transferase and occurs at asparagine residues that are part of the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr), where Xaa can be any amino acid, except proline (13Bause E. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 14Roitsch T. Lehle L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Imperiali B.

The observation that not all consensus sequences are glycosylated suggests that there are additional sequence or conformational requirements essential for efficient carbohydrate attachment (17Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 18Apweiler R. Hermjakob H. Sharon N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). Although at least 12-14 amino acids must be synthesized and have entered the luminal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum for carbohydrate addition, the synthesis of the protein need not be completed for glycosylation to take place (19Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This suggests that the structures for carbohydrate addition are recognized in partially folded molecules. The sequence context of the glycosylation site has also been shown to influence the efficiency of glycosylation. For example, it has been reported that Pro at the +3 position relative to Asn or Asp at +1 can inhibit glycosylation (14Roitsch T. Lehle L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 21Bause E. Hettkamp H.

Spitalnik S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9465-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Human erythropoietin is a 165-amino acid glycoprotein with three N-linked carbohydrates attached to asparagines at amino acid positions 24, 38, and 83 and one O-linked carbohydrate attached to Ser126 (24Egrie J.C.

The structure of rHuEPO 1The abbreviation used is: rHuEPO, recombinant human erythropoietin. 1The abbreviation used is: rHuEPO, recombinant human erythropoietin. and the functional importance of the amino acids for activity is well studied (26Cheetham J.C.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The importance of the carbohydrate on rHuEPO has been demonstrated by the ability to increase the in vivo activity and serum half-life of the protein by adding more N-linked carbohydrates to the molecule (9Delorme E. Lorenzini T. Giffin J. Martin F. Jacobsen F. Boone T. Elliott S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9871-9876Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Higuchi M. Oh-eda M. Kuboniwa H. Tomonoh K.

Structural requirements for carbohydrate can be deduced by analyzing glycosylation analogs. In this manner structural requirements for O-linked glycosylation of rHuEPO have been determined using rHuEPO Ser and Thr analogs (32Elliott S. Bartley T. Delorme E. Derby P. Hunt R. Lorenzini T. Parker V. Rohde M.F. Stoney K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11237-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that it is possible to engineer new functional N-linked glycosylation sites into rHuEPO and other proteins by introducing consensus sequences for N-linked carbohydrate addition (12Elliott S. Lorenzini T. Asher S. Aoki K. Brankow D. Buck L. Busse L. Chang D. Fuller J. Grant J. Hernday N. Hokum M. Hu S. Knudten A. Levin N. Komorowski R. Martin F. Navarro R. Osslund T. Rogers G. Rogers N. Trail G. Egrie J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Construction and study of N-linked carbohydrate glycosylation analogs are therefore tractable models for studying the structural requirements and functional consequences of carbohydrate addition.We utilized an in vitro mutagenesis approach to introduce N-linked glycosylation sites into various positions on the amino acid backbone of rHuEPO. The new proteins were examined for addition of N- and O-linked carbohydrate and to assess the effect of the mutations on structure. We also examined the effects of adjacent amino acids on glycosylation. Our results suggest that an added N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence is necessary but not sufficient for carbohydrate addition. Addition of carbohydrate can precede folding of a molecule. We also found that a consensus sequence that is not glycosylated could be converted into a functional site by manipulation of adjacent sequences.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of rHuEPO Glycosylation Analogs—In vitro mutagenesis was performed on an rHuEPO cDNA clone by using either oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with synthetic oligonucleotides and single-stranded DNA derived from M13mp18 bacteriophages or by PCR as described (12Elliott S. Lorenzini T. Asher S. Aoki K. Brankow D. Buck L. Busse L. Chang D. Fuller J. Grant J. Hernday N. Hokum M. Hu S. Knudten A. Levin N. Komorowski R. Martin F. Navarro R. Osslund T. Rogers G. Rogers N.

Blood. 1996; 87: 2702-2713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With both methods, the appropriate DNA fragment was cut by restriction endonucleases, purified, and ligated into an SV40 expression vector. The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by direct DNA sequence analysis.Expression of Variants in Mammalian Cells—SV40 expression vectors containing the rHuEPO glycosylation analog sequences were transfected into COS-1 cells by the calcium phosphate method (29Elliott S. Lorenzini T. Chang D. Barzilay J. Delorme E. Giffin J. Hesterberg L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2702-2713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) or by electroporation (29Elliott S. Lorenzini T. Chang D. Barzilay J. Delorme E. Giffin J. Hesterberg L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2702-2713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three to 5 days after transfection, the culture supernatants were harvested, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. For larger quantities of material, stable expression was obtained by transformation of Chinese hamster ovary cells.Analysis of Expressed Proteins—The presence of carbohydrate was assessed by SDS-PAGE Western blots. Aliquots of conditioned medium from cells expressing the desired rHuEPO glycosylation analog were immunoprecipitated overnight at room temperature with an anti-rHuEPO rabbit polyclonal antibody (34Elliott S. Chang D. Delorme E. Dunn C. Egrie J. Giffin J. Lorenzini T. Talbot C. Hesterberg L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2714-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated material was subjected to SDS-PAGE as described previously (32Elliott S. Bartley T. Delorme E. Derby P. Hunt R. Lorenzini T. Parker V. Rohde M.F. Stoney K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11237-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the resolved proteins were blotted to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose and subjected to Western analysis (35Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5867) Google Scholar) by using a mouse anti-rHuEPO monoclonal antibody (9G8a) (34Elliott S. Chang D. Delorme E. Dunn C. Egrie J. Giffin J. Lorenzini T. Talbot C. Hesterberg L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2714-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bands were visualized using an anti-mouse IgG from a Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories) and 4-chloronaphthol as substrate, or with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). In some cases, supernatants were directly loaded onto SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with the 9G8a anti-EPO monoclonal antibody and visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Some analogs were deglycosylated with N-glycanase (Glyko Inc.). The samples were boiled in 0.1% SDS, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.5) containing 0.02% sodium azide. Final concentrations of 0.75% Nonidet P-40 and 10 mm dithiothreitol were added along with 22.5 milliunits of N-glycanase before incubating the samples overnight at 37 °C. The deglycosylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to Western analysis as described above. For partial deglycosylation, purified samples were diluted to 1 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 140 mm sodium chloride and incubated at 37 °C with 15 milliunits of N-glycanase (Sigma) for various times and subjected to 4-20% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining.Purified rHuEPO and a hyperglycosylated A30N/H32T rHuEPO analog were subjected to additional characterization including peptide map analysis and N-terminal sequencing. Peptide map analysis was performed by dilution to 0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.2) and overnight incubation at 37 °C in the presence of 0.002 mg/ml endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Applied Science). Resulting peptides were separated by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a Jupiter C5 column (Phenomenex), with a linear gradient of 9-54% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. N-terminal sequencing of selected peptides was performed using a Procise 494-A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems).Analysis of Protein Structure and Determination of Locations of Consensus Sequences—Immunoassays were used to assess expression and protein conformation and stability. Radioimmunoassays were carried out using a rabbit anti-rHuEPO polyclonal antibody as described (36Egrie J.C. Cotes P.M. Lane J. Gaines Das R.E. Tam R.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 99: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoassays using the antibody 9G8a were performed as described previously (29Elliott S. Lorenzini T. Chang D. Barzilay J. Delorme E. Giffin J. Hesterberg L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2702-2713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 9G8a immunoreactivity has been shown to increase following denaturation or following introduction of destabilizing mutations into rHuEPO via in vitro mutagenesis (29Elliott S. Lorenzini T. Chang D. Barzilay J. Delorme E. Giffin J. Hesterberg L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2702-2713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that 9G8a immunoreactivity is a surrogate assay for structure or stability. The solved NMR (26Cheetham J.C. Smith D.M. Aoki K.H. Stevenson J.L. Hoeffel T.J. Syed R.S. Egrie J. Harvey T.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) structure of rHuEPO allowed a detailed examination of the tertiary structure of the molecule in regions where carbohydrate addition sites were introduced. The structure was also used to calculate the amount of a particular amino acid present on the surface of the folded and secreted protein (fractional surface exposure). We assumed that fractional surface exposure of substituted amino acids was not affected by mutagenesis.RESULTSIn order to identify the rules that define an N-linked glycosylation site, we introduced N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences into defined regions of the rHuEPO gene by using in vitro mutagenesis. 62 different rHuEPO glycosylation analogs were constructed with consensus sequences introduced into 47 different positions. Some of these analogs have been shown previously to result in attachment of additional carbohydrate to rHuEPO (12Elliott S. Lorenzini T. Asher S. Aoki K. Brankow D. Buck L. Busse L. Chang D. Fuller J. Grant J. Hernday N. Hokum M. Hu S. Knudten A. Levin N. Komorowski R. Martin F. Navarro R. Osslund T. Rogers G. Rogers N. Trail G. Egrie J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Both Asn-Xaa-Ser and Asn-Xaa-Thr consensus sequences were introduced. In some cases, existing Asn, Ser, or Thr residues were used as part of the introduced consensus sequence. In other cases, two or more substitutions were required, e.g. Trp88 and Pro90 were converted to Asn88 and Thr90 (W88N/P88T). If a Pro residue was present at the Xaa position, it was substituted with another amino acid because a Pro at the Xaa position inhibits N-linked glycosylation (17Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). At some positions, multiple replacements were made in order to examine the effects of substitutions at the -1, +2, and +4 positions relative to Asn. The genes were expressed in COS cells because these cells are mammalian in origin and are known to add both N- and O-linked carbohydrates to rHuEPO following transient transfections of the gene (9Delorme E. Lorenzini T. Giffin J. Martin F. Jacobsen F. Boone T. Elliott S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9871-9876Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Elliott S. Lorenzini T. Asher S. Aoki K. Brankow D. Buck L. Busse L. Chang D. Fuller J. Grant J. Hernday N. Hokum M. Hu S. Knudten A. Levin N. Komorowski R. Martin F. Navarro R. Osslund T. Rogers G. Rogers N. Trail G. Egrie J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar).A typical analysis of rHuEPO glycosylation analogs expressed in COS cells is shown in Fig. 1 (top panel). Some of the analogs were associated with an increased apparent size compared with rHuEPO, suggesting that additional carbohydrate was present, i.e. these analogs were hyperglycosylated (compare 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, and 10th lanes to 1st, 5th, 8th, and 9th lanes).There were also apparent differences in size distributions of the various rHuEPO glycosylation analogs. The increased distribution was presumably because of partial carbohydrate addition whereby there was a mixture of molecules containing three or four N-linked carbohydrates (e.g. compare 2nd lane, A30N/H32T, with 10th lane, P129S/L130N).To confirm the presence of additional carbohydrate, analogs were enzymatically deglycosylated by digestion with N-glycanase. Following digestion, all the samples had reduced size indicating that N-linked carbohydrate was removed. Most samples, including the rHuEPO native sequence control, were reduced to two bands (Fig. 1, lower panel, 1st 8 lanes). The apparent molecular masses of these bands were ∼18 and 20 kDa. The upper band (20 kDa) has been identified previously as an O-glycosylated form of rHuEPO, with the carbohydrate chain attached at Ser126 (32Elliott S. Bartley T. Delorme E. Derby P. Hunt R. Lorenzini T. Parker V. Rohde M.F. Stoney K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11237-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the lower band was shown to be unglycosylated rHuEPO. The 9th and 10th lanes of Fig. 1, lower panel, had only the lower band, indicating that the analogs with A125N/A127T and P129S/L130N substitutions contained no O-linked carbohydrate. This indicated that the introduction of a new N-linked consensus sequence at some positions could inhibit O-linked carbohydrate addition nearby.To confirm that increased size was due to increased numbers and not increased size of existing carbohydrates, peptide maps of one of the purified glycosylation analogs (A30N/H32T) and purified rHuEPOs were obtained (Fig. 2A). The elution positions of all peptides from both proteins were identical except for the first peptide, which eluted 4 min earlier in the A30N/H32T glycosylation analog peptide map (22.2 min) as compared with the rHuEPO peptide map (26.1 min). The earlier, more hydrophilic elution of the analog peptide is indicative of the additional carbohydrate present. Subsequent N-terminal sequence analysis of the analog peptide at 22.2 min was performed (Fig. 2B). Asn residues with attached carbohydrate (N*) and Cys residues (C) are not recovered during N-terminal sequencing and are observed as blank cycles. Partial glycosylation of asparagine results in a proportional recovery of the asparagine residues. Analysis of the analog peptide gave blank cycles for the Asn30 residue, indicative of complete attachment of carbohydrate at that position. The peptide also included the two naturally occurring N-linked sites at Asn24 and Asn38, and both gave blank cycles.Fig. 2Characterization of the A30N/H32T rHuEPO glycosylation analog.A, peptide map analysis of rHuEPO and A30N/H32T rHuEPO analog. Reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of peptides generated from proteolytic digestion of purified rHuEPO and A30N/H32T rHuEPO analog (depicted as N30 T32) was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The chromatographic traces for both peptide maps are shown. B, sequence analysis of the A30N/H32T glycosylation analog. N-terminal sequence analysis of A30N/H32T rHuEPO was performed for 19 cycles as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The observed sequence result and background-subtracted picomole recovery of each residue is shown. Asparagine residues with attached carbohydrate (N*) and cysteine (C) residues are not recovered during sequencing. C, analysis of partially deglycosylated rHuEPO and A30N/H32T rHuEPO analog. Deglycosylation of purified rHuEPO and A30N/H32T rHuEPO analog was performed with N-glycanase digestion for 5, 15, and 180 min at 37 °C and subjected to 4-20% SDS-PAGE analysis with visualization using Coomassie Blue stain. A non-deglycosylated control is also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Further evidence of attachment of carbohydrate to the introduced N-linked consensus sequence was obtained from a time course of deglycosylation by N-glycanase (Fig. 2C) whereby incomplete deglycosylation occurs. With this method, four bands corresponding to forms containing 0-3 N-linked carbohydrates were detected with rHuEPO (1st-4th lanes). The diffuse nature of each of the bands is thought to be from the heterogeneity in size of the attached carbohydrate structures. A time course of deglycosylation of the A30N/H32T rHuEPO analog (5th-8th lanes) yielded an additional higher molecular weight band, for a total of 5 bands. This is consistent with attachment of an additional N-linked carbohydrate at the introduced N-linked consensus sequence. These results confirm that the increased apparent size of certain analogs was due to the presence of additional amounts of N-linked carbohydrate.N-Linked glycosylation consensus sequences were introduced into 47 different positions on the rHuEPO backbone (Fig. 3). These rHuEPO glycosylation analogs were expressed in COS cells and examined by Western blot. The locations of the introduced consensus sequences were distributed throughout the length of the protein and included α-helical regions, turns, connection loops, and antiparallel β-sheets. Additional N-linked carbohydrates were detected with analogs containing consensus sequences at 15 of the 47 positions examined (32%). The consensus sequences that were successfully glycosylated were dispersed throughout the molecule. The fact that we did not detect additional carbohydrate addition with consensus sequences introduced at the majority of the positions (68%) suggests that most positions do not support N-linked carbohydrate addition. We concluded that a consensus sequence is necessary but not sufficient for N-linked carbohydrate addition.Fig. 3Natural and introduced consensus sequences in the rHuEPO amino acid backbone. The rHuEPO backbone is composed of 165 amino acids. Boxes indicate the locations of the four α-helical motifs (αA, αB, αC, and αD). Vertical lines on the top indicate the location of each introduced N-linked consensus sequences. Lines on the bottom indicate the locations of the existing glycosylation sites: Ser126 is the site for O-linked carbohydrate. The presence of additional carbohydrate was determined by Western analysis, and analogs containing additional carbohydrate are indicated by a circle attached to the top of the vertical line.

The structure also contains a short turn bound by a Cys29-Cys33 disulfide bond.Consensus sequences were introduced into 12 different positions within the four helices at positions 9, 19, 55, 56, 57, 58, 69, 111, 138, 147, 144, and 155. Three of the 12 analogs contained additional N-linked carbohydrate (consensus sequences introduced into amino acid positions 55, 57, and 69; Fig. 3). This result suggests that a consensus sequence contained within an α-helical region can be glycosylated. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the introduction of the consensus sequence altered the secondary structure of the region.Analogs containing N-linked consensus sequences in 21 of 25 positions in the C-D loop were constructed and tested. The C-D loop is notable in that it"

We describe for the first time the reconstitution of thiazole synthase activity using cell-free extracts and proteins derived from adenosine-treated E. coli 83-1 cells. The addition of adenosine or adenine to growing cultures of Aerobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, and E. coli has been shown previously to relieve the repression by thiamine of its own biosynthesis and increase the expression levels of the thiamine biosynthetic enzymes. By exploiting this effect, we show that the in vitro thiazole synthase activity of cleared lysates or desalted proteins from E. coli 83-1 cells is dependent upon the addition of purified ThiGH-His complex, tyrosine (but not cysteine or 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate), and an as yet unidentified intermediate present in the protein fraction from these cells. The activity is strongly stimulated by the addition of S-adenosylmethionine and NADPH.

All organisms able to produce the vitamin initially assemble the correspondent monophosphate (TP) by coupling 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine pyrophosphate (Hmp-PP) and 4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl) thiazole phosphate (Thz-P) (Fig. 1) (1Begley T.P.

TP is then converted to the biologically active form, TPP, either by direct phosphorylation (in enteric bacteria) or by de-phosphorylation to thiamine followed by pyrophosphorylation (in aerobic bacteria and yeast) (2Spenser I.D. White R.L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1997; 36: 1033-1046Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The two heterocyclic precursors of thiamine pyrophosphate, Hmp-PP and Thz-P, are biosynthesized through independent pathways. In Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, Hmp-PP derives from 5-aminoimidazole ribotide (AIR), a precursor shared between thiamine and de novo purine biosyntheses (3Estramareix B. Therisod M.

The sulfur atom is initially transferred to IscS, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent cysteine desulfurase (15Zheng L.M. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), in the form of a persulfide of an active site Cys residue (16Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is likely that in vivo the sulfur atom is then passed to ThiI (12Webb E. Claas K. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4399-4402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a persulfide of residue Cys-456 (13Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. Cheng H. Larson T.J. Mueller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8283-8286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The sulfur atom is then transferred to the C terminus of ThiS, converting it to a thiocarboxylate (14Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-20103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. Kinsland C. Chiu H.J. Costello C.K. Backstrom A.D. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16555-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This final sulfur transfer reaction requires the activation of ThiS as its acyladenylate (17Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. Kinsland C. Chiu H.J. Costello C.K. Backstrom A.D. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16555-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The adenylation reaction is catalyzed by ThiF, which has been observed to form a complex with ThiS (17Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. Kinsland C. Chiu H.J. Costello C.K. Backstrom A.D. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16555-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, an unusual acylpersulfide link between ThiS thiocarboxylate and Cys-184 of ThiF has been observed, and mutagenesis studies suggest it may be important for thiazole formation (18Xi J. Ge Y. Kinsland C. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8513-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Recent studies with purified Bacillus subtilis proteins have resulted in the first demonstration of thiazole biosynthesis in a bacterial cell-free system (19Park J.H. Dorrestein P.C. Zhai H. Kinsland C. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12430-12438Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although B. subtilis shares some metabolic components with E. coli, including some of the biosynthetic proteins (ThiFSG, ThiI, and IscS) and two metabolic precursors (Dxp and Cys), the biosynthetic pathways also differ significantly. Whereas B. subtilis depends upon ThiO, an oxygen-dependent flavoenzyme, to utilize glycine to provide the C-2–N-3 fragment of the thiazole (1Begley T.P. Downs D.M. Ealick S.E. McLafferty F.W.

Xi J. Kinsland C. Taylor S. McLafferty F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, tyrosine was cleaved to p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, a known by-product of TPP biosynthesis (25White R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 583: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but sulfur transfer from 35S-ThiS thiocarboxylate did not occur (1Begley T.P. Downs D.M. Ealick S.E. McLafferty F.W. Van Loon A. Taylor S. Campobasso N. Chiu H.J. Kinsland C. Reddick J.J. Xi J. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).Analysis of the ThiH sequence has identified a conserved cysteine triad motif, thought to be involved in Fe-S cluster binding and characteristic of the “radical AdoMet” family (26Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Recently, hexahistidine-tagged ThiH (ThiH-His) has been isolated in a complex with ThiG and shown to contain a highly oxygen-sensitive Fe-S cluster (21Leonardi R. Fairhurst S.A. Kriek M. Lowe D.J. Roach P.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which might explain the difficulty in obtaining in vitro activity under aerobic conditions. The ThiGH complex is likely to be involved in the last steps of the thiazole biosynthesis, a cyclization reaction that could conceivably require sulfur transfer to Dxp from either the ThiS thiocarboxylate or the ThiFS conjugate, condensation with Tyr (or a derivative), and cyclization to the thiazole product.The addition of adenosine or adenine during the growth phase of enteric bacteria, such as Aerobacter aerogenes (27Moyed H.S.

Tucker R.G. Biochem. J. 1968; 106: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Adenosine and adenine are negative regulators of de novo purine biosynthesis (33Zalkin H. Nygaard P. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R.R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

J. 1966; 100: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thiamine has been identified recently (34Winkler W. Nahvi A. Breaker R.R. Nature. 2002; 419: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) as one of the cellular metabolites with the potential to regulate its own production by directly binding to regulatory regions upstream of thiC and thiM within polycistronic mRNAs. A decrease in intracellular thiamine might therefore be expected to result in higher levels of biosynthetic enzymes (30Kawasaki T. Iwashima A. Nose Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1969; 65: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), thus providing a potential source of enzymes suitable for in vitro studies of thiazole biosynthesis.As a pre-requisite to elucidating the function of the ThiGH complex and the mechanism of the thiazole cyclization in E. coli, we report here the reconstitution of thiazole biosynthetic activity in vitro using a cell-free system containing extracts from adenosine-treated E. coli 83-1 cells (6Estramareix B. Therisod M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 192: 375-380Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and purified ThiGH-His under anaerobic conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Materials were purchased from the following suppliers: aldolase, triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI) (both from rabbit muscle), and all other reagent grade chemicals from Sigma unless otherwise stated; adenosine, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 4-aminobenzoic acid from Across; d-glucose from BDH; HPLC grade solvents, K2HPO4 and KH2PO4, from Fisher; K3[Fe(CN)6] and β-l-arabinose from Avocado; polyacrylamide/bispolyacrylamide solution (30% w/v, 37.5:1) from Amresco. Hmp and Thz-P were prepared as described (35Andersag H. Westphal K. Chem. Ber. 1937; 70: 2035-2044Crossref Google Scholar, 36Leder I.G. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 18: 166-167Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) was a generous gift from Dr. H. Schroeder (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany). For TLC analysis, aluminum-backed TLC plates (Silica Gel 60, F-254, 250 μm) were used. A Gilson 321 HPLC system connected to a Shimadzu RF-10Axl fluorimeter and/or to a Gilson UV-visible detector was used for HPLC analysis. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AC300 (300 MHz) spectrometer.Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Proteins—E. coli 83-1 cells, which are Tyr/Trp/Phe auxotrophs, were the generous gifts from Prof. R. Azerad and Prof. M. Therisod (6Estramareix B. Therisod M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 192: 375-380Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). BL21(DE3) cells transformed with a pET-23b-derived plasmid encoding for a hexahistidine-tagged 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (Dxs-His) were kindly donated by Prof. A. Boronat (37Lois L.M.

Dxs-His was expressed from these cells and purified to ∼80% purity by nickel-affinity and gel filtration chromatographies. ThiG and ThiH-His were purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) pRL1020 as described previously (21Leonardi R. Fairhurst S.A. Kriek M. Lowe D.J. Roach P.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was routinely estimated by the method of Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar); ThiG and ThiH-His concentrations in the ThiGH-His complex were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis and gel densitometry (Syngene Gene Genius imaging system) against bovine serum albumin standards.HPLC Purification of Dxp—Dxp was enzymatically synthesized as described by Taylor et al. (39Taylor S.V. Vu L.D. Begley T.P. Schorken U. Grolle S. Sprenger G.A. Bringer-Meyer S. Sahm H. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 2375-2377Crossref Google Scholar), and the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC analysis (40Hecht S. Kis K. Eisenreich W. Amslinger S. Wungsintaweekul J. Herz S. Rohdich F. Bacher A. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 3948-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When the reaction was judged to be complete, the proteins were removed by ultrafiltration (10-kDa molecular weight cut-off, Millipore), and Dxp was purified by semipreparative HPLC (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Prep-10 Octyl column, 250 × 10.0 mm). Dxp was eluted with H2O at 2 ml/min, and the column eluate was fractionated from t = 6.0 to t = 8.0 min. The TPP-containing fractions were identified by TLC analysis and discarded. The TPP-free fractions were pooled and freeze-dried. The Dxp content of the resultant white solid (which also contained residual salts) was determined by 1H NMR, and a stock solution of Dxp (50 mm) was prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2. The absence of contaminating TPP was confirmed with the thiochrome assay (41Gerrits J. Eidhof H. Brunnekreeft J.W.I. Hessels J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Cell Culture Media—The following media were used to grow or resuspend E. coli 83-1: DM medium, Davis and Mingioli medium (42Davis B.D. Mingioli E.S. J. Bacteriol. 1950; 60: 17-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without glucose; DM1 medium, DM medium supplemented with glucose (0.2%, w/v), Tyr and Phe (0.2 mm each), Trp (0.1 mm), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 4-aminobenzoic acid (10 μm each) (6Estramareix B. Therisod M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 192: 375-380Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Combinations of Tyr (0.2 mm), Hmp (14 μm), and Thz-P (14 μm) were added to the DM medium where stated. DM and DM1 media were supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) in all the experiments with E. coli 83-1 pRL1020.Time Course of the Adenosine Derepression—E. coli 83-1 was derepressed in DM1 medium containing adenosine (300 μg/ml), essentially as described previously (6Estramareix B. Therisod M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 192: 375-380Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The TPP content was determined in duplicate by the thiochrome assay (41Gerrits J. Eidhof H. Brunnekreeft J.W.I. Hessels J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and expressed as nanograms of TPP/mg of wet cells. To be able to use the “wet weight” of the cell pellets in the calculations, the published procedure was slightly modified. Single colonies were used to inoculate DM1 medium (10 ml) and the cells grown for 8–10 h; the resultant culture was used as a 0.3% inoculum into fresh DM1 medium (300 ml) and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (Beckman JA-14, 12,000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C), resuspended in DM medium (10 ml), transferred to pre-weighed tubes (15 ml), and centrifuged (Beckman JA-14 with adaptors, 7000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C). After having drained most of the medium, residual liquid was removed by gently wiping the walls of each tube with a clean tissue. Tubes were then re-weighed, and the wet weight was obtained by subtraction. The weighed cell pellets were resuspended in DM medium to yield 24 mg/ml suspensions, pooled, used as inoculum (1.3 ml) in DM1 medium (100 ml/flask, 12 flasks), and aerated in a rotary shaker. β-l-Arabinose (0.2%) was added to the DM1 medium during derepression experiments with E. coli 83-1 pRL1020, where indicated. To provide duplicate data, a pair of flasks were withdrawn at t = 0 and every 30 min for 2.5 h, rapidly cooled in icy water, and the cells harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were then resuspended and washed with sterile 0.9% NaCl (two times, 10 ml), and the wet weight determined as described above. Cell pellets (27–180 mg) were stored at –80 °C until analyzed.The thiochrome method (41Gerrits J. Eidhof H. Brunnekreeft J.W.I. Hessels J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was adapted to estimate the TPP content in cell pellets. Briefly, the frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice for 10 min and then resuspended in a 1:1 mixture of H2O/7.2% HClO4 (2 ml for cell pellets of up to 80 mg of wet cells, 4 ml for heavier cell pellets); the white suspensions were sonicated on ice and the precipitated proteins removed by centrifugation. The supernatants (0.5 ml) were oxidized with a K3[Fe(CN)6] (12 mm in 3.35 m NaOH) solution (100 μl) (41Gerrits J. Eidhof H. Brunnekreeft J.W.I. Hessels J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and then adjusted to pH 7.0 with phosphoric acid, and an aliquot (50 μl) was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC using a Phenomenex ODS column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size) and eluted with buffer A (140 mm K2HPO4, 12% MeOH, 1.5% N,N-dimethylformamide, 0.3 mm tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, pH 7.0) and buffer B (70% MeOH, 30% H2O). The compounds were eluted at 0.8 ml/min with linear gradients between the following time points: t = 0 min, 0% buffer B; t = 2 min, 0% buffer B; t = 5 min, 20% buffer B; t = 10 min, 20% buffer B; t = 12 min, 40% buffer B; t = 15 min, 40% buffer B; and detected by fluorescence (excitation at 360 nm and emission at 454 nm). TPP, TP, and unphosphorylated thiamine solutions of known concentration were derivatized and analyzed by HPLC by the same method. The retention times of the thiochrome derivatives of TPP, TP, and unphosphorylated thiamine were determined to be 7.5, 9.0, and 15.0 min, respectively. TP and TPP calibration curves (0–1.3 μm) were constructed and used to quantify the thiamine derivatives present in samples. Unphosphorylated thiamine was not detected in any of the in vivo or in vitro enzyme assays, but the retention time was determined to exclude the possibility of unphosphorylated thiamine contributing to the total amount of thiamine derivatives present.TPP Production by Washed Cell Suspensions—Experiments were carried out in duplicate. Cultures of E. coli 83-1 or 83-1 pRL1020 (100 ml/flask, 14 flasks) were incubated with adenosine as described above, and samples withdrawn at t = 0, 1.0, and 2.5 h to monitor the derepression phase. At the end of this phase, the cultures were quickly cooled in icy water, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation (Beckman JA-14, 12,000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C). The cell pellets were then washed with sterile 0.9% NaCl (two times, 10 ml) and transferred to pre-weighed tubes to be weighed. The pellets were resuspended in DM medium to yield 30 mg/ml suspensions, pooled, and used as a 10% inoculum into DM medium (10 ml) containing Hmp and either Tyr or Thz-P or no supplement. The 10-ml cultures were shaken at 37 °C, and the cells were harvested every 30 min for 2 h by centrifugation. The cell pellets were washed with NaCl solution, weighed, and stored at –80 °C until analyzed. The TPP content was estimated as described above.Large Scale Growth of E. coli 83-1 pRL1020 in the Presence of Adenosine—A single colony was used to inoculate DM1 medium (10 ml), and cells were grown at 37 °C for 8–10 h. This culture (3 ml) was used to inoculate fresh DM1 medium (800 ml). After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (Beckman JA-14, 12000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C). The cell pellets were weighed and resuspended in DM medium to yield 100 mg/ml suspensions, and then the resultant cultures were pooled and used as inocula (5 ml) in DM1 medium (four times, 1.25 liters) supplemented by the addition of adenosine (300 mg/liter). Cells were grown at 37 °C for 2.5 h, then cooled down by swirling in icy water, and harvested. The typical yield of cell paste ranged between 5.5 and 7.5 g from 5 liters. The cell paste was stored at –80 °C until used.Preparation of Cell-free Extracts Under Anaerobic Conditions— Where possible cell samples were manipulated under anaerobic conditions using a Belle glove box (<2 ppm of O2). Cell-free extracts from derepressed E. coli 83-1 pRL1020 or BL21(DE3) pRL1020 were prepared by introducing weighed amounts of cell paste (0.8–1.0 g) into the glove box and resuspending it in anaerobic reaction buffer (1.6–2.0 ml, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 12.5% (w/v) glycerol). The suspensions were then withdrawn from the anaerobic box and rapidly lysed by sonication. The lysates were returned to the box and allowed to degas for 10 min and then cleared by centrifugation (Beckman JA-14 with appropriate adaptors, 7000 rpm, 15 min at 4 °C) in gas-tight tubes. The protein concentration in these lysates was typically 35–45 mg/ml. The cleared lysate prepared from E. coli BL21(DE3) pRL1020 cells (grown in 2YT medium) was routinely gel-filtered through a NAP-10 column (AP Biotech), equilibrated in anaerobic reaction buffer to remove nearly all of the low molecular weight molecules, including TPP, and is referred to as the “ThiGH-His-enriched fraction.” Cell-free lysates and desalted protein fractions were prepared by similar methods from derepressed E. coli 83-1 pRL1020 and are termed “derepressed 83-1 lysate” and “derepressed 83-1 protein fraction,” respectively.Measurement of the in Vitro Thiazole Synthase Activity by Enzymatic Coupling to Hmp-PP and Thiochrome Assay—Unless otherwise specified, the term “thiamine” is used to indicate any vitamin form, regardless of the extent of phosphorylation. A typical reaction mixture contained the following: 100 μl of derepressed 83-1 lysate or protein fraction, 100 μl of ThiGH-His-enriched protein fraction or purified ThiGH-His (8.0–10.0 mg/ml, total protein concentration) in anaerobic reaction buffer, ATP (20 mm), Tyr (1.5 mm), Cys (1.5 mm), Dxp (1.0 mm), and Hmp (0.6 mm). Depending on the experiment, the total volume varied between 250 and 350 μl, as required. Tyr stock solutions (40 mm) were prepared in 100 mm HCl. Cys stock solutions (80 mm) were freshly prepared by dissolving the solid in anaerobic reaction buffer. Dxp and Hmp stock solutions (50 and 14 mm, respectively) were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2. The ATP stock solutions (250 mm) were prepared in 300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. All solutions were prepared within the glove box using anaerobic buffer or allowed to degas in the glove box (30 min) before being added to the reaction mixtures. To determine the background level of TP or TPP present in the assays, control reactions were prepared and immediately stopped for analysis. The remaining reactions were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, then stopped by adding HClO4 (7.2%, 500 μl), and the total volume adjusted to 1 ml with H2O. The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant (500 μl) assayed for TP and TPP. Due to the presence of DTT, the sensitivity of the thiochrome assay had to be optimized by doubling the final K3[Fe(CN)6] concentration. For each set of conditions, the amounts of TP and TPP were estimated separately, the respective background levels subtracted, and the results expressed as pmol/mg of protein/h.Effect of S-Adenosylmethionine and Reductants—Samples of purified ThiGH-His (100 μl, 113–136 μm in ThiH-His) were incubated for 2 h with a 5-fold molar excess of FeCl3 and Na2S, in the presence of DTT (5 mm), under anaerobic conditions. Thus treated ThiGH-His was added to in vitro reaction mixtures containing S-adenosylmethionine (1 mm) and NADPH (1 mm) in addition to Tyr, Hmp, ATP, and derepressed 83-1 protein fraction and then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Alternatively, the reconstituted ThiGH-His samples were anaerobically incubated with sodium dithionite (1 mm) for 30 min at room temperature (43Miller J.R. Busby R.W. Jordan S.W. Cheek J.

Peptide binding is known to induce conformational changes in class II MHC proteins on the basis of a variety of hydrodynamic and spectroscopic approaches, but the changes have not been clearly localized within the overall class II MHC structure. To map the peptide-induced conformational change for HLA-DR1, a common human class II MHC variant, we generated a series of monoclonal antibodies recognizing the β subunit that are specific for the empty conformation. Each antibody reacted with the empty but not the peptide-loaded form, for both soluble recombinant protein and native protein expressed at the cell surface. Antibody binding epitopes were characterized using overlapping peptides and alanine scanning substitutions and were localized to two distinct regions of the protein. The pattern of key residues within the epitopes suggested that the two epitope regions undergo substantial conformational alteration during peptide binding. These results illuminate aspects of the structure of the empty forms and the nature of the peptide-induced conformational change.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HA, hemagglutinin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ABTS, 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid); SPR, surface plasmon resonance. molecules are heterodimeric cell-surface proteins that play an important role in the initiation of antigen-specific immune responses. Class II MHC proteins bind peptides derived from extracellular, endosomal, and internalized cell-surface antigens, and present them at the cell surface for inspection by CD4+ T cells (1Watts C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 821-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures have been determined for peptide complexes of several polymorphic variants of both human and murine class II MHC molecules (reviewed in Ref. 2McFarland B.J. Beeson C. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 168-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Both the MHC α and β chains contribute to the peptide binding site, which is made up of a β sheet floor topped by two roughly parallel α helical regions. Each subunit contributes an immunoglobulin-like domain below the peptide binding site, as well as short transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Peptides bind in an extended conformation in the groove between the two helices, with ∼10 residues able to interact with the MHC protein, and the peptide termini extending from the binding site. This conformation, similar to a polyproline type II helix, has a 2.7-residue repeat and appears to be dictated by a network of conserved hydrogen bonding interactions between the MHC and bound peptide (3Jardetzky T.S. Brown J.H. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The conformation places 4–6 of the peptide side chains into pockets within the overall groove. The residues lining these pockets vary between allelic variants, providing different peptide-sequence binding specificity. Overall the interaction buries ∼70% of the peptide surface area in the central region of a bound peptide, leaving the remainder available for interaction with antigen receptors on T cells (4Stern L.J. Wiley D.C. Structure. 1994; 2: 245-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although the canonical structure visualized by x-ray crystallography is relatively stereotyped, a number of studies have suggested that alternate conformations of class II MHC molecules can exist under certain conditions (5Sato A.K. Zarutskie J.A. Rushe M.M. Lomakin A. Natarajan S.K. Sadegh-Nasseri S. Benedek G.B. Stern L.J. J. Biol.

Kinetic studies of the peptide-binding reaction indicate a multistep binding pathway, suggesting that peptide binding is accompanied by a conformational change in the MHC, although other interpretations of these kinetic analyses are possible (9Mason K. Denney Jr., D.W. McConnell H.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5216-5227PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mason K. McConnell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that at low pH, MHC molecules shift their equilibrium from a “closed” to an “open” or “peptide-receptive” state (16Sadegh-Nasseri S. Germain R.N. Nature. 1991; 353: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 17Jensen P.E. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Dornmair K. Rothenhausler B. McConnell H.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 409-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These alternate conformations have been suggested to play an important role during the peptide-binding reaction, and also in the interaction with the endosomal peptide exchange factor HLA-DM (6Natarajan S.K. Assadi M. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4030-4036PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rabinowitz J.D. Vrljic M. Kasson P.M. Liang M.N. Busch R. Boniface J.J. Davis M.M. McConnell H.M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6144-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Little structural information is available for the empty form of the protein. Spectroscopic and hydrodynamic studies on HLA-DR1, a common human class II protein and the subject of this study, have shown that a distinct conformational change occurs upon peptide binding, suggesting that the conformation of the empty protein is different from that of the peptide-loaded form (8Zarutskie J.A. Sato A.K. Rushe M.M. Chan I.C. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Stern L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5878-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Joshi R.V. Zarutskie J.A. Stern L.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3751-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The conformational change results in a decrease in hydrodynamic radius from 35 to 29 Å, together with a small increase in helical content as observed by circular dichroism (8Zarutskie J.A. Sato A.K. Rushe M.M. Chan I.C. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Stern L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5878-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The change can be induced by binding any of a large variety of peptides, including a capped dipeptide (5Sato A.K. Zarutskie J.A. Rushe M.M. Lomakin A. Natarajan S.K. Sadegh-Nasseri S. Benedek G.B. Stern L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2165-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and also by filling the P1 side chain binding pocket through mutagenesis (7Natarajan S.K. Stern L.J. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3463-3470PubMed Google Scholar). Conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies have long been used to investigate structural properties of proteins (23Goldberg M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 358-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These antibodies are able to distinguish between two or more structural forms of a protein, and are useful as structural and biological probes of the molecular surface. Mapping the epitopes of such antibodies can provide information on the nature of the structural change and on the location of the regions involved (24Fedorov A.N. Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Alakhov Y.B. Goldberg M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In previous work, the happenstance cross-reactivity of an antibody raised against the murine MHC protein I-As was used to help map regions involved in the peptide-induced conformational change in human HLA-DR1, which is only 66% identical with I-As. In the present work, a set of monoclonal antibodies directed against the β chain of HLA-DR1, raised by immunization with unfolded β subunit, was screened for the ability to distinguish between empty and peptide-loaded conformations of the intact, folded protein. In an effort to gain site-specific structural information about the peptide-induced conformational change, the epitope of each of these antibodies was mapped. Two distinct regions of the MHC β chain that are accessible in the empty but not peptide-loaded conformation were identified: one nearby but not coincident with the peptide binding site, and one across the molecule near the membrane-spanning region. Empty and peptide-loaded DR1 were prepared by expression in Escherichia coli and folded in vitro, as previously described (25Frayser M. Sato A.K. Xu L. Stern L.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, HLA-DR1 extracellular domains were expressed individually as insoluble inclusion bodies, isolated by denaturing ion exchange chromatography, and refolded in vitro without peptide. Peptide complexes were prepared by incubating immunoaffinity purified empty HLA-DR1 (1–5 μm) with at least 5-fold molar excess peptide for 3 days at 37 °C in PBS. The resultant peptide-DR1 complexes (or HLA-DR1 that had not been loaded with peptide and had been stored at 4 °C) were purified by gel filtration to remove aggregates and unbound peptide, and stored at 4 °C. HLA-DR allelic variants other than HLA-DR1 (and HLA-DRB5*0101 (26Li Y. Li H. Martin R. Mariuzza R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)) have been difficult to prepare by this method, and so HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR52 (and control HLA-DR1) were produced instead using an insect cell expression system (27Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 28Cameron T.O. Norris P.J. Patel A. Moulon C. Rosenberg E.S. Mellins E.D. Wedderburn L.R. Stern L.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 268: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, HLA-DR extracellular domains were secreted by Drosophila S2 cells transfected with genes carrying endogenous signal sequences, and HLA-DR proteins were isolated from conditioned medium by immunoaffinity and loaded with peptide as described above for HLA-DR1 from E. coli. Peptides were synthesized using an Advanced ChemTech 490 synthesizer and standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Biotinylated peptides were produced by addition of biotin-LC-LC-NHS ester (succinimdyl-6′-(biotinamido)-6-hexanamido hexanoate; Pierce) to the deprotected NH2 terminus of each peptide while still on the solid support. The reaction was carried out overnight in dimethylformamide with a catalytic amount of diisopropylethylamine. Crude peptides carrying either free amino- or biotin-LC-LC termini were deprotected and cleaved with a solution of 83% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% phenol, 5% water, 5% dithiothreitol, and 2% triisopropylsilane, and then precipitated in ether, washed, and lyophilized. Peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a gradient of 2–100% acetonitrile over 80 min. Purity was determined by analytical high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Mice (BALB/c x B10.A F1 hybrid) were immunized with purified, insoluble DR1 β chain (DRB1*0101) expressed in E. coli inclusion bodies. Hybridomas were obtained by standard techniques, including fusion with Sp2/0 myeloma, selection in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium, and repeated cloning by limiting dilution. After primary ELISA screening of hybridoma supernatants for reactivity with the denatured DR1 β subunit immunogen, the positive supernatants were screened for their ability to distinguish empty DR1 from HA-peptide-loaded DR1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (see below). After three rounds of subcloning and screening, four monoclonal hybridomas were selected for further study. Each of the four antibodies selected (MEM-264, MEM-265, MEM-266, and MEM-267) reacted with empty but not HA-peptide-loaded DR1 as well as several other DR allelic variants (see below). For Western blotting, purified DR proteins, or whole cell lysates of B cells or transfectants, were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or Immobilon-P (Millipore), and blocked with 1% BSA before incubation with the monoclonal antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase-coupled, affinity purified, goat anti-mouse IgG. For epitope mapping and cellular studies, the monoclonal antibodies were produced either as ascites in mice or in hybridoma culture using serum-free medium (Hybridoma SFM, Invitrogen), and were purified by protein A affinity chromatography. The antibody class of each monoclonal antibody was determined by enzyme immunoassay using a mouse-hybridoma subtyping kit (Roche). A sandwich ELISA was used for determination of the relative binding of antibodies to empty and peptide-loaded HLA-DR1. Purified antibodies (1 μg/ml unless noted) were immobilized onto Dynatech Immobilon-4 polystryrene 96-well plates, by incubation for 4 h at room temperature (or overnight at 4 °C). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 3% BSA in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies present in ascites fluid or hybridoma culture supernatant were bound to goat anti-mouse IgG that had been immobilized as described above for purified antibodies. After antibody coating, the plates were washed three times with TBST (25 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Dilutions of empty HLA-DR1, HA-peptide-loaded HLA-DR1, or HLA-DR1 complexes with other peptides were prepared in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.3% BSA, and incubated with the immobilized antibodies for 2 h at 25 °C. After binding, the plates were washed three times with TBST, incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with rabbit anti-DR1 antiserum (“CHAMP”) diluted 1/25,000 in PBST, and washed again. Finally, the plates were incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit Fc (Roche) diluted 1/4,000, washed, and developed using the colorimetric peroxidase substrate ABTS (Roche). Absorbance increase because of peroxidase activity (405 nm) was measured in a microtiter plate reader (Wallac, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For complexes of the very weakly bound peptide YRAL, excess peptide was included in the HLA-DR1 incubation. Apparent antibody binding affinities and optimum pH for each antibody was determined using this ELISA as well. A variation of the sandwich ELISA was used to estimate antibody-peptide affinity. Plates were coated with MEM antibodies, blocked, and washed as above, and then incubated with varying concentrations of biotinylated peptide for 1 h at 25 °C. Plates were washed three times with TBST, and binding was detected with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin and the colorimetric peroxidase substrate ABTS, as above. The concentration of half-maximal binding is reported as a measure of relative binding affinity. Another variation of the sandwich ELISA was used to confirm that the antibodies react with intact DR1 αβ heterodimers and not only isolated β subunits. Plates were coated with MEM antibodies, blocked, and washed as above, and then incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with various concentrations of empty DR1 that had been biotinylated on the cysteine residue introduced at the COOH terminus of the α chain (29Cochran J.R. Stern L.J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 683-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Plates were washed three times with TBST, and binding was detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin and the colorimetric substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (both from KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). Direct Binding ELISA—For epitope mapping, antibody-peptide interaction was measured using a direct ELISA with immobilized peptides and immunochemical detection of bound antibody. Ninety-six-well microtiter plates (as above) were coated with streptavidin (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA) at a concentration of 500 ng/well (overnight at 4 °C, in PBS). Plates were then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 3 h at 25 °C to block nonspecific binding sites. After washing three times with TBST, biotinylated peptides were added at a concentration of 10 μm in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.3% BSA and allowed to bind for 1 h at 25 °C. Plates were washed with TBST and test monoclonal antibodies (100 μlof1 μg/ml monoclonal antibody) were added, followed by incubation for 1 h at 25 °C. Plates were again washed with TBST three times and binding was determined using a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody, as above (Roche). Plates were developed using ABTS and absorbance was measured in a microtiter plate reader. Competition ELISA for Peptide Screening—Antibody-peptide interaction was also measured using a competition ELISA, in which soluble peptide and empty HLA-DR1 competed for binding to immobilized antibody, with immunochemical detection of bound HLA-DR1. Microtiter plates were coated with test monoclonal antibodies (100 μl at a concentration of 1 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were then blocked and washed as above and incubated with or without peptides. After a 30-min peptide incubation, 100 ng of empty HLA-DR1 was added to each well (peptides were not washed away). DR1 binding was measured as above, using rabbit anti-DR1 antiserum (1/25,000) followed by peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit Fc (1/4,000) as the secondary and detection antibodies, respectively. Plates were developed using ABTS and absorbance was measured in a microtiter plate reader. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) SpotMatrix Analysis—SpotMatrix SPR analysis was performed using an Applied Biosystems 8500 Affinity Chip Analyzer, with immobilized peptides and surface plasmon resonance detection of bound antibody. Biotinylated peptides were spotted using a SMP10B pin (Telechem) on a MicroSys spotter (Cartesian Dispensing Systems, presently Genomic Solutions) at a concentration of 25 μg/ml (∼10 mm) in 20 μl of either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum or 4 mg/ml BSA in PBS. Each spot had an approximate diameter of 330–360 μm and a volume of 2.5 nl per spot. Multiple copies of each chip were made and tested. Following chip equilibration for approximately 1 h in PBST at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, 5 ml of test monoclonal antibody at the indicated concentration in PBST (10 mm sodium phosphate, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4) was flowed over the SpotMatrix at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 8 min. Dissociation was monitored over a 10-min time span. End point binding was calculated after background subtraction of individual reference spots from the generated SpotMatrix affinity traces (RCU, resonance change units, as a function of time). One RCU corresponds to a 1-millidegree SPR shift. The end point consisted of the averaged RCU values for the last minute of the association/equilibrium phase prior to the start of dissociation. Cell surface expression of empty and total HLA-DR1 on immature dendritic cells and control splenocytes was assessed by flow cytometry. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were prepared as previously described by culture of bone marrow cells from class II-deficient mice transgenic for a chimeric DRB1*0401 molecule (a gift of B. Huber) or from normal non-transgenic C57BL/6 mice. Bone marrow cells depleted for red blood cells were cultured (1–2 × 106 cells/ml) in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin 4 (10 ng/ml each, R&D Systems) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, HEPES (10 mm), glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units each/ml). The cultures were replenished with cytokines every third day before harvesting for staining with MEM antibodies. Cells were harvested carefully by using cell lifters (COSTAR) to avoid unwanted cell damage/injury, washed in FACS buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.1% sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2), and suspended in the same buffer. Approximately 1 × 105 cells were stained with saturating amounts of antibody for 45 min on ice, washed three times with FACS buffer, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated (Fab′)2 anti-mouse IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 45 min. After incubation, the cells were washed three times, suspended in 300 μl of buffer, and analyzed immediately using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Propidium iodide (BD Pharmingen) negative cells were gated for analysis. Splenocytes used as a control were obtained from the same mice and were used freshly after red blood cell lysis.

The human class II MHC protein HLA-DR1 can be obtained in well characterized empty and peptide-loaded forms by separately expressing the α and β subunits in E. coli and subsequently refolding the subunits together in vitro in the absence or presence of peptide ligand (25Frayser M. Sato A.K. Xu L. Stern L.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Previously, we have used these species to characterize the peptide-induced conformational change in HLA-DR1 (5Sato A.K. Zarutskie J.A. Rushe M.M. Lomakin A. Natarajan S.K. Sadegh-Nasseri S.

Binding of any of a variety of peptide ligands induces a distinct conformational change, characterized by a decrease in hydrodynamic radius, an increase in per-residue molar ellipticity, and changes in binding of an antibody recognizing a polymorphic epitope on the β subunit. Similar changes have been shown for mouse homologues of HLA-DR1 (32Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Wettstein D.A. Allbritton N.L. Davis M.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Runnels H.A. Moore J.C. Jensen P.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To probe in more detail the structural changes involved in the ligand-induced conformational change in HLA-DR1, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies that distinguish the empty and peptide-loaded conformations were generated. Antibodies were raised by immunization with purified, denatured β subunit, and hybridomas were screened using a sandwich ELISA for their ability to preferentially bind to the empty but not the peptide-loaded form of HLA-DR1 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Four antibodies (MEM-264, MEM-265, MEM-266, and MEM-267) were selected based upon these characteristics. Each of the antibodies specifically binds to the empty but not peptide-loaded form of HLA-DR1 (Fig. 1A). Another antibody, LB3.1 (36Gorga J.C. Knudsen P.J. Foran J.A. Strominger J.L. Burakoff S.J. Cell Immunol. 1986; 103: 160-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Fu X.T. Karr R.W. Hum. Immunol. 1994; 39: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), does not distinguish the two forms of the protein, and binds both forms (Fig. 1B). Although the MEM epitopes are present on the β subunit, all MEM antibodies capture DR αβ heterodimers as efficiently as the αβ complex-specific antibody LB3.1 (Fig. 1C). Each of the antibodies was tested using a variety of different peptide complexes, to determine whether they were sensitive to the peptide-induced conformational change regardless of the peptide sequence, and to rule out the possibility that antibody binding might simply be blocked by particular features of the HA peptide used in the initial screen. In each case, the MEM antibody bound only to the empty complex, and not to any of the MHC-peptide complexes tested (Fig. 2). The set of peptides tested had completely different sequences with different MHC-interacting anchor residues (bold in Fig. 2A), and included both high-affinity viral antigens and self-peptides, as well as designed variants of lower binding affinity and decreased half-life (5Sato A.K. Zarutskie J.A. Rushe M.M. Lomakin A. Natarajan S.K. Sadegh-Nasseri S. Benedek G.B. Stern L.J. J. Biol.

The MHC-peptide complex with CLIP, a fragment of the class II-associated invariant chain chaperone, and an important intermediate in the class II biosynthetic pathway, was not recognized by the MEM antibodies. Importantly, even the minimal binding tetra-peptide YRAL, which occupies only the NH2-terminal half of the peptide binding site (5Sato A.K. Zarutskie J.A. Rushe M.M. Lomakin A. Natarajan S.K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2165-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), is able to completely abrogate the binding of the MEM antibodies. Thus, each of the MEM antibodies distinguishes empty and peptide-loaded forms of HLA-DR1, without regard for the detailed nature of the bound peptide. The reactivity of the MEM antibodies was characterized in more detail. Antibodies MEM-264, MEM-265, and MEM-267 are of the IgG2b isotype, whereas MEM-266 is IgG2a, and all carry the κ light chain. Each of the antibodies reacted strongly by Western blotting with reduced and denatured DR1 β subunits in whole cell lysates of B cells and transfectants expressing DR1, but not with SDS-solubilized (not boiled) samples from the same cells that contain native DR1αβ-peptide complexes (4Stern L.J. Wiley D.C. Structure. 1994; 2: 245-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Each antibody reacted also with an unidentified band of ∼80 kDa present in lysates of a variety of cells, and MEM-266 also reacted with several other unidentified bands. Other class II MHC proteins, HLA-DQ1 and DP4, were not recognized in whole cell lysates of transfected cells by any of the antibodies. The sandwich ELISA was used to determine the optimum binding pH and half-maximal binding affinity for each antibody (Table I). MEM-264, M"
https://openalex.org/W2002480651,"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) results from the accumulation of apoptosis-resistant clonal B cells that are arrested in G0/G1, and is heterogeneous with respect to clinical outcome. An aggressive form of the disease is identified by an impaired p53 response to ionizing radiation (IR). This is associated with inactivating mutations of either p53 or ATM, a regulator of p53 activated by IR-induced DNA damage. Since other forms of DNA damage activate p53 via ATR, a kinase closely related to ATM, abnormalities of the ATR-p53 pathway also have the potential to result in p53 dysfunction. We therefore tested cases of CLL for abnormal p53 responses to ultraviolet irradiation (UVC), a known activator of ATR, to screen for additional forms of p53 dysfunction. CLL cells and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) preparations (predominantly noncycling lymphocytes) were treated with UVC and assessed for p53 responses. In all of the CLL cases and PBMC preparations tested, we were unable to detect p53 accumulation, phosphorylation or transcriptional consequences in response to UVC-induced DNA damage. The most likely explanation for the absence of UVC-induced p53 activation in CLL and normal lymphocytes was that, in contrast to other cell types, the UVC-induced ATR pathway was inactive. This notion was confirmed by showing that ATR protein was absent or undetectable in all of the cases of CLL and normal PBMCs screened. This was an unexpected finding because ATR was thought to be essential for the viability of somatic cells and for normal human and murine embryonic development. An obvious difference between the cell lines used as positive controls for ATR antibodies and the CLL cells/PBMCs was that the former were actively cycling while the latter were quiescent. We therefore hypothesized that the ATR-p53 pathway is selectively downregulated in noncycling lymphocytes. To test this, we induced cycling in the T-cell fraction of PBMC preparations and demonstrated that ATR protein expression was restored. Furthermore, p53 was upregulated and phosphorylated in response to UVC in these cells. Our data support the conclusion that the ATR-p53 pathway is suppressed in noncycling lymphocytes via ATR downregulation. We tentatively suggest that this repressed DNA damage response may have evolved to protect quiescent lymphocytes from the potential for p53-dependent apoptosis in the face of some forms of endurable genotoxic stress. If this is the case, DNA repair and genome stability might be compromised in quiescent lymphocytes with potentially negative consequences."

For example, homologs to the key developmental factor bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2 have been cloned by sequence identity from arthropods, mollusks, cnidarians, and nematodes. Wide conservation of protein sequences suggests that differential gene expression explains many of the vast morphological differences between species. To test the hypothesis that the regulatory mechanisms controlling this evolutionarily ancient and critical gene are conserved, we compared sequences flanking Bmp2 genes of several species. We identified numerous conserved noncoding sequences including some retained because the fish lineage separated 450 million years ago. We tested the function of some of these sequences in the F9 cell model system of Bmp2 expression. We demonstrated that both mouse and primate Bmp2 promoters drive a reporter gene in an expression pattern resembling that of the endogenous transcript in F9 cells. A conserved Sp1 site contributes to the retinoic acid responsiveness of the Bmp2 promoter, which lacks a classical retinoic acid response element. We have also discovered a sequence downstream of the stop codon whose conservation between humans, rodents, deer, chickens, frogs, and fish is striking. A fragment containing this region influences reporter gene expression in F9 cells. The conserved region contains elements that may mediate the half-life of the Bmp2 transcript.

The phenotypes of these mutants prove that BMP signaling is required for vital developmental processes. The evolutionary conservation of the BMP2 and BMP4 proteins at both the functional and sequence levels is remarkable. Easily recognizable Bmp genes have been cloned from distantly related phyla such as arthropods, mollusks, cnidarians, and nematodes. Except for the nematode BMPs, the amino acid sequences of nonvertebrate BMPs are 70–87% identical to human BMP2 (Ref. 22Lelong C. Mathieu M. Favrel P. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and references therein). The Drosophila protein DPP, which is 71% identical to human BMP2, is functionally interchangeable with mammalian BMPs in a mammalian bone induction assay (23Sampath T.K. Rashka K.E. Doctor J.S. Tucker R.F. Hoffmann F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6004-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Conversely, the closely related mammalian BMP4 can rescue the dorsal-ventral axis defects of Drosophila lacking DPP function (24Padgett R.W. Wozney J.M. Gelbart W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2905-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Indeed, entire signaling pathways involving BMPs are conserved. For example, BMPs and their antagonists appear to play analogous, although inverted, roles in dorsal-ventral axis formation in vertebrates and invertebrates (25Hogan B. Nature. 1995; 376: 210-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Both Bmp2 in mouse and dpp in Drosophila are expressed in a highly tissue- and stage-specific pattern. Multiple promoters and alternative splicing produce a variety of dpp transcripts in Drosophila (26St. Johnston R.D. Hoffmann F.M. Blackman R.K. Segal D. Grimaila R. Padgett R.W. Irick H.A. Gelbart W.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1114-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Like Bmp2, the dpp mRNA has an unusually long 3′-untranslated region with portions highly conserved between flies (27Newfeld S.J. Padgett R.W. Findley S.D. Richter B.G. Sanicola M. de Cuevas M.

Our work, and that of others, suggests that mammalian Bmp2 may be regulated in an equally complex manner (29Ghosh-Choudhury N. Choudhury G.G. Harris M.A. Wozney J. Mundy G.R. Abboud S.L. Harris S.E.

The first indication that the vitamin A-derivative retinoic acid (RA) is involved in regulating the Bmp2 gene was our discovery of its strong induction in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells stimulated to differentiate with RA (35Rogers M.B. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Gudas L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). F9 cells lacking retinoic acid receptor (RAR) γ fail to express Bmp2 in response to RA (36Boylan J. Lufkin T. Achkar C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RA also induces the Bmp2 gene in the developing chick limb (37Francis P.H. Richardson M.K. Brickell P.M. Tickle C. Development. 1994; 120: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar). Many Bmp2-expressing tissues develop abnormally in vitamin A-deficient embryos or after exposure to teratogenic levels of vitamin A or other retinoids. These include the heart and cardiovasculature, limbs, central nervous system, craniofacial structures, and vertebrae (4Hogan B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 38Zile M. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 455S-458SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). F9 cells are widely used as a model of cellular differentiation and early embryonic development (39Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 1-254Google Scholar, 40Martin G.R. Science. 1980; 209: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The morphology, pattern of gene expression, and cell cycle of undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cells resemble that of the totipotent stem cells of the blastocyst inner cell mass. F9 cells differentiate rapidly and synchronously into primitive extraembryonic endoderm upon treatment with RA and into parietal extraembryonic endoderm upon treatment with RA and cAMP analogs (41Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 347-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). This model system has been used to identify genetic elements controlling the expression of many important developmental genes. Bmp2 is expressed at three distinct levels in F9 cells (35Rogers M.B. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Gudas L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 42Rogers M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar). Undetectable in undifferentiated stem cells, the Bmp2 transcript is readily detectable in RA-treated cells. The combination of elevated cAMP levels and RA increases the abundance of the Bmp2 transcript 5–6-fold more than RA alone. Cyclic AMP elevation alone induces neither differentiation nor expression of Bmp2. This indicates that maximally expressing Bmp2 requires a synergistic interaction between RA and cAMP. Reasoning that the regulatory elements controlling this ancient and critical gene were conserved (43Hardison R.C. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 369-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), we compared sequences flanking the Bmp2 genes from several species. We tested the function of several conserved noncoding sequences in F9 cells representing three embryonic cell types: stem cells, primitive endoderm, and parietal endoderm. The results suggest that, like other RA-induced genes lacking classical retinoic acid response elements (RAREs), a protein-protein interaction between retinoid receptors and Sp1 contributes to RA responsiveness. In addition, a portion of the 3′-untranslated region that has been conserved for 450 million years influences Bmp2 expression. All plasmids were purified using Qiagen® plasmid purification kits. Genomic DNA was isolated from cells grown on 150-mm dishes, lysed with ligation-mediated PCR lysis buffer, incubated overnight at 37 °C, and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction (44Garrity P.A.

Samples were covered with mineral oil and thermocycling was performed in a MasterCycler gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf). The cycling conditions were as follows: 2 cycles: denature at 97 °C for 3 min; anneal, 60 °C for 30 min; extend, 76 °C for 10 min followed by 29 cycles: 97 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 3 min, and 76 °C for 3 min. The ramping time between denaturation at 97 °C and annealing at 60 °C was set to 1 °C/s. The reactions were separated on a 0.7% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Following the initial sequencing of the squirrel monkey and African green monkey Bmp2 sequences, the following degenerate primers were designed using ClustalW alignments of the rodent, primate, and deer Bmp2 sequences: nt –140 to –116, 5′-CGTCCACACCCCTGCGCGCNGCTCC-3′; nt 645 to 619 5′-ATGGCTCGGGGCAGCCATC(C/G)TGGGCGA-3′. Genomic PCR using these primers was performed as described above. Following visualization of the genomic PCR products, Southern analysis was performed by standard methods (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probes for Southern blot analysis were made by primer extension using Bmp2-specific primers or random primers and [α-32P]dCTP (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed by the Molecular Biology Core Facility at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center (Tampa, FL) and the UMDNJ, New Jersey Medical School Molecular Resource Facility (Newark, NJ). A 2.3-kb squirrel monkey PCR product was isolated by gel electrophoresis and Sephaglas™ (Amersham Biosciences) purification. After adding an A to the ends with TaqDNA polymerase (Promega), the fragment was cloned into the pCRII TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting clone, pCRIISQM2.3Bmp2 was digested with NotI, BamHI, SmaI or, NheI and SpeI, or SalI and XhoI to remove 1-, 1.6-, 1.2-, 1.1-, and 1.3-kb fragments, respectively. The ends were religated to make pCRIISMBmp2-5′Not, pCRIISMBmp2-3′Bam, pCRIISMBmp2ΔSma, pCRIISMBmp2-3′Nhe, and pCRIISMBmp-5′Sal, respectively. pCRIISMBmp2-5′Not was digested with SstII and the ends religated to create pCRIISMBmp2-5′NotΔSstII. Each plasmid was sequenced using T7 and Sp6 primers or the following squirrel monkey-specific primers: SMB2aF, 5′-CTGTTTCTTTTACTTTTCCTCC, SMB2bF, 5′-GACCCCACGCTAGCCACAAA, SMB2bR, 5′-AAGCTGGTGCAGTCGTCCTCC, SMB2aR1, 5′-GTGTGGGAAGCGGAGCGACT, SMB2aR2, 5′-GGTCGCTGGCGGACGCTGT. A 1696-nt fragment was amplified from African green monkey genomic DNA and sequenced using the degenerate primers 5′-cgcggatccATTNNCCTCTGTGGGTTGCTAATCCG-3′ (mouse nt –1217 to –1192, lowercase letters indicate an added BamHI site) and 5′-GGGCNCATTCTCgaGCGAGTCGAGC-3′ (mouse nt 479 to 455, RevBmp2XhoI, lowercase letters indicate an added XhoI site) as described above. This PCR product also was digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites in pBluescript II SK+ to make pBS-AGM599 (analogous to mouse –104 to 465 nt) and sequenced with T7 and Sp6 primers. Contiguous squirrel monkey sequences were assembled using the Phrap interface in CuraTools. 2curatools.curagen.com. ABI trace viewing, ClustalW alignment/editing and percent identity were calculated using BioEdit. 3mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html. Promoter predictions were performed by neural network analysis. 4fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter. Putative transcription factor binding sites were determined by visual inspection and using TRANFAC and TFD analysis at SIGNALSCAN. 5bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/signal. Multiple alignments for figures and percent identity plots were performed using MultiPipMaker 6bio.cse.psu.edu/pipmaker. and VISTA. 7www-gsd.lbl.gov/vista.

B716-LUC (nt –245 to 471, pGL716dBX)—pGL1.7XX was linearized with HindIII and partially digested with BamHI. A 724-nt fragment (716 nt of Bmp2) was ligated into pGL2BasicΔBam cut with BglII and HindIII.

AGM-LUC (Analogous to Mouse nt –104 to 465, pGLAGM599)— pBS-AGM599 was digested with BamHI, made blunt with Klenow, digested with XhoI, and cloned into pGL2BasicΔBam digested with SmaI and XhoI. SqM-LUC (Analogous to Mouse nt –104 to 465, pGLSQM600)—A 1.6-kb fragment was PCR amplified from pCRIISQM2.3KB with the primers described above. The PCR product was digested with BamHI, made blunt with Klenow, digested with XhoI, and then cloned into pGL2BasicΔBam digested with SmaI and XhoI. F9 embryonal carcinoma cells were plated on dishes precoated with 1% gelatin and incubated at 37 °C with 10% CO2. The culture media consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum and 2 mm glutamine (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). The cells were induced to differentiate into parietal endoderm by adding 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid, 250 μm dibutyryl cAMP, and 500 μm theophylline (RACT). Undifferentiated control cells were treated with 250 μm dibutyryl cAMP and 500 μm theophylline (CT). Transfections were performed essentially as described by Vasios et al. (46Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, for 96-h drug treatments, F9 cells were plated at 1 × 106 or 0.3 × 106 (CT only) cells per 100-cm dish (Nunc) for 12 h, drugged for 48 h with CT or RACT, transfected by overnight calcium phosphate precipitation, and then cultured for an additional 48 h with drugs. Each 100-cm dish was cotransfected with 10 μg of reporter plasmid and 3 μg of pβAclacZ (46Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were extracted and luciferase activity was determined using the Promega Luciferase Assay system and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytic Luminescence Laboratory). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by dividing the raw luciferase value by the units of β-galactosidase activity (1 unit = A420·μl–1 h–1). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described in Glozak et al. (47Glozak M.A. Li Y. Reuille R. Kim K.H. Vo M.N. Rogers M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) except poly(dA-dT) was used to block nonspecific binding. Expression vectors encoding human RARβ and murine RXRγ (obtained from R. Evans) were linearized with BamHI and in vitro transcribed and translated using the TnT T7-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dr. F. Kashanchi provided human recombinant Sp1 from Promega Corp. ChIP conditions were adapted from Kang et al. (48Kang Z. Pirskanen A. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48366-48371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). F9 cells (∼1 × 108) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. 125 mm glycine was added to block cross-linking. Then, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin), and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged, resuspended in wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin), and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. The isolated nuclei were centrifuged and resuspended in 2 ml of RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin). 0.5 ml of suspended nuclei were sonicated to an average DNA length of 500–1200 base pairs using an ultrasonic processor with a microtip (8 × 10 s). 400 μg of sonicated DNA in 500 μl of RIPA buffer was centrifuged and the supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of protein A slurry (50% protein A-Sepharose in 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 400 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA) for 30 min. The precleared supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 2–4 μg of specific antibodies with rotation overnight at 4 °C. All antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.: Sp1 (PEP2) SC-59, RARα (C-20) SC-551, RARβ (C-19) SC-552, RXRα (D-20) SC-553, and RXRγ (Y-20) SC-555. Immunocomplexes adsorbed onto 100 μl of protein A beads were washed sequentially with 1 ml of washing buffer 1 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100), washing buffer 2 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100), washing buffer 3 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 mm, 1% sodium deoxycholate), and washing buffer 4 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). Antibody-bound chromatin fragments were eluted from the beads with 500 μl of 1% SDS in 0.1 m NaHCO3. Formaldehyde-induced cross-links were reverted by heating at 65 °C overnight. DNA then was extracted using 80 μg/ml proteinase K digestion, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. The DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of sterile H2O and 5 μl was used as a template for PCR. After separation on 1% agarose gels, the PCR products were subjected to Southern blot analysis as described above. Noncoding Sequences Upstream of the Bmp2 Gene Are Widely Conserved in Mammals and Chick—The Bmp2 coding sequences are highly conserved in distantly related animal phyla (3Wozney J.M. Rosen V.

Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Bmp2 expression also is conserved in several vertebrate tissues during early development. For example, Bmp2 transcripts occur in the posterior regions of developing mouse and chick limb buds and zebrafish fin buds (4Hogan B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 49Martinez-Barbera J.P. Toresson H. Da Rocha S. Krauss S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 53-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like others, we observed that the regions upstream of the Bmp2 gene are highly conserved between humans and mice (32Sugiura T. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Similarly, the untranslated regions (UTRs) of Bmp2 transcripts are conserved between many species. This suggests that critical regulatory elements mediating the expression of Bmp2 have been retained throughout evolution. To test the hypothesis that Bmp2 regulatory elements are conserved, we developed a PCR strategy to amplify Bmp2 noncoding regions from other species. We identified conserved regions 1.2 kb upstream of the distal promoter (30Heller L.C. Li Y. Abrams K.A. Rogers M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1394-1400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and at the 3′ end of exon 1. A degenerate upstream PCR primer was designed using a ClustalW alignment of the mouse and human Bmp2 genomic sequences. The degenerate exon primer was designed by comparing the human, mouse, rat, deer, and rabbit Bmp2 cDNA sequences. The locations of these primers and sequence accession numbers are shown in Fig. 1. Each primer sequence was compared with GenBank™ using BLAST 8www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. and no significant similarity to other sequences was found. The predicted 2.3-kb Bmp2 fragment was PCR amplified from murine (M. musculus, strain 129) genomic DNA using these degenerate primers. Similarly sized products (±200 nt) were also amplified from genomic DNA isolated from rat (R. norvegicus), hamster (C. griseus), human, squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), African green monkey (C. aethiops), marmoset (C. jacchus), dog (C. familiaris), and wallaby (M. eugenii) using these primers (not shown). We cloned and sequenced the amplified fragment from squirrel monkey (GenBank™ accession number AY494188). Subsequently, we designed degenerate internal primers flanking the distal promoter (nt –140 to 619, Fig. 1A). These primers amplified fragments from owl monkey (A. trivirgatus), cow (B. taurus), and chicken (G. gallus), as well as the species indicated previously (Fig. 1B). The ability of the primers to amplify fragments indicates that the primer sequence occurs in each genome. However, to confirm that the amplified fragments were the Bmp2 sequence, the PCR products were hybridized to a 1.7-kb Bmp2 fragment (–1237 to +471 nt relative to the distal promoter). This probe hybridized to the amplified fragments under normal stringency conditions (6× SSC, 50% formamide, 42 °C, Fig. 1B). These results demonstrated that the PCR products were indeed Bmp2 fragment"

The mechanism by which the concentration of sphingolipids such as glucosylceramide is increased in this disease is poorly understood. We have found that, in NPC fibroblasts, the cholesterol storage affects the stability of glucosylceramidase (GCase), decreasing its mass and activity; a reduction of cholesterol raises the level of GCase to nearly normal values. GCase is activated and stabilized by saposin C (Sap C) and anionic phospholipids. Here we show by immunofluorescence microscopy that in normal fibroblasts, GCase, Sap C, and lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), the most abundant anionic phospholipid in the endolysosomal system, reside in the same intracellular vesicular structures. In contrast, the colocalization of GCase, Sap C, and LBPA is markedly impaired in NPC fibroblasts but can be re-established by cholesterol depletion.

High levels of unesterified lipoprotein-derived cholesterol (Chol) accumulate in NPC1-deficient cells. Although alterations of Chol metabolism play a key role in the pathogenesis of NPC, there is also a more general dysfunction of the intracellular metabolism of lipids such as sphingolipids (SL) (7Vanier M.T.

Spleen and liver of NPC patients accumulate not only Chol, but also glucosylceramide (GC), lactosylceramide, and sphingomyelin. Normal concentrations of Chol, but pathological levels of GC, lactosylceramide, GM2-ganglioside and asialo-GM2 in brain are typical findings (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Morris J.A.

In normal cells, the SL are degraded in late endosomes/lysosomes by specific hydrolases. Some of these enzymes need the assistance of activator proteins such as saposins to exert their function (11O'Brien J. Kishimoto Y. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 12Kishimoto Y. Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1255-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Furst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Saposins are a group of four similar small glycoproteins, Sap A, B, C, and D, each of them stimulating the enzymatic degradation of specific SL. In fact, Sap B is required for the degradation of sulfatides by arylsulfatase A, and Sap C is required for the degradation of GC by glucosylceramidase (GCase) (14Wenger D.A. De Gala G. Williams C.

Pampols T. Guardiola A. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The physiological role of saposins has been unequivocally demonstrated by the observation that SL storage diseases can be caused either by the deficiency of a specific hydrolase or of an individual saposin. For instance, Gaucher disease, a genetic disorder characterized by an extensive GC accumulation within the lysosomes of cells of monocyte/macrophage origin, can be caused by a deficit of either GCase or Sap C (16Christomanou H. Chabas A. Pampols T. Guardiola A. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the Sap C-deficient cases of Gaucher disease, normal levels of GCase are unable to degrade GC. The role of Sap C in the enzymatic GC degradation has been examined in detail. In the past, we have provided compelling evidence that Sap C, at low pH values mimicking the acidic lysosomal environment, tightly binds to and destabilizes anionic phospholipid-containing membranes (17Vaccaro A.M.

Upon affecting the physical organization of these membranes, Sap C promotes the association of GCase with the lipid surface, thus favoring the contact between the enzyme and its lipid substrate, GC (18Vaccaro A.M.

Anionic phospholipids play a key role in the Sap C-promoted interaction of GCase with membranes; changes in the level and organization of these lipids can affect the topology and activity of GCase (18Vaccaro A.M.

Res. 1999; 24: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Vanier M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 750: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because SLs such as GC are believed to be centrally involved in the pathogenesis of NPC disease (21Zervas M. Somers K.L. Thrall M.A. Walkley S.U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1283-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), the mechanism of their accumulation and the properties of the hydrolases involved in the SL degradation have been extensively investigated. For instance, it has been found that the activities of GCase and sphingomyelinase are markedly reduced in NPC fibroblasts (22Besley G.T.N. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 752: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Chol-mediated regulation of sphingomyelinase activity has been investigated (23Thomas G.H. Tuck-Muller C.M. Miller C.S. Reynolds L.W. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1989; 12: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Reagan J.W. Hubbert M.L. Shelness G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38104-38110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas informations on the regulation mechanism of GCase in NPC cells are not available. It is important to fill this gap, because the accumulation of GC is very pronounced in several NPC tissues. The aim of our present work was to investigate the factors that might influence the GCase activity and stability in NPC cells. The possibility that the function of Sap C, a required cofactor for the enzymatic degradation of GC, might be altered in these cells was also taken into consideration and investigated.

[35S]methionine (Tran35S-Label™, 1175 Ci/mmol) and methionine/cysteine-deficient DMEM were obtained from ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA. Lipoprotein-deficient bovine serum (LPDS) was obtained from Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. Filipin and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were obtained from Sigma. Kodak X-Omat Blue films were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Prolong anti-fade kit was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). SDS-PAGE reagents were from Bio-Rad. ECL Western blotting reagents were from Amersham Bioscience, Buckinghamshire, UK. Cell Cultures—Two human fibroblast lines with previously described severe NPC1 mutations were used (25Millat G. Marçais C. Tomasetto C. Chikh K. Fensom A.H. Harzer K. Wenger D.A. Ohno K. Vanier M.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 1373-1378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The NPC1a cell line (81057) was homozygous for a Q775P mutation located in the sterol-sensing domain and shown to produce no detectable NPC1 protein by Western blot analysis. The NPC1b cell line (90089, affected sib of reported 87024) was homozygous for a V282fs mutation. Normal and NPC1 fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For specific experiments, NPC1 cells were first grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and then subcultured in fresh medium containing 10% LPDS for the indicated periods of time. GCase Assay—To measure the GCase activity, lipid substrate GC, purified from Gaucher spleens, was utilized (26Vaccaro A.M. Muscillo M. Salvioli R. Tatti M. Gallozzi E. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). GC was labeled with tritium in the glucose moiety (27McMaster Jr., M.C. Radin N.S. J. Labelled Comp. Radiopharm. 1977; 13: 353-357Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained in a final volume of 0.1 ml: 0.1/0.2 M citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 5.6, 10 μg of cell homogenate, 20 μg of GC supplemented with the 3H-labeled compound to a specific activity of 3000 dpm/nmol, 0.25% taurocholate, and 0.05% oleic acid. The assay mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The incubation was terminated by the addition of 0.4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 50 μl of a 0.1% glucose solution. After shaking and centrifugation at 4000 rpm, the enzymatically released [3H]glucose present in the aqueous phase was estimated by radioactivity measurements. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal (8E4) and rabbit polyclonal anti-GCase antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. H. Aerts, E. C. Slater Institute for Biochemical Research, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Rabbit anti-human Sap C antibody was prepared in our laboratory (17Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-human lysosome-associated membrane protein type 1 (LAMP1) antibody, developed by Dr. J. T. August, was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). Mouse monoclonal anti-lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) antibody (6C4) was a generous gift of Dr. J. Gruenberg, Department of Biochemistry, University of Geneva, Switzerland. The anti-actin monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma. Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed with 10% acrylamide gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and GCase was detected with anti-GCase monoclonal antibody 8E4 using an ECL Western blotting kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Bioscience, Buckinghamshire, UK). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of GCase or Sap C— Skin fibroblast cultures were grown until they almost reached confluency. Prior to being labeled, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 and starved for 2 h in methionine and cysteine-free medium containing 4% dialyzed FBS. This medium was replaced with the labeling medium (DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine and supplemented with [35S]methionine, 150 μCi/ml, and 4% dialyzed FBS). After a 1-h incubation, the cells were washed three times with DMEM and non-radioactive chase medium was added (DMEM containing 4% FBS). The cells were chased for the indicated periods and then harvested and disrupted in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet/50 ml in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5). The suspensions were subjected to brief sonication and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. For removing DNA and histones, the supernatants were incubated with 0.03% protamine sulfate for 45 min at 4 °C and centrifuged as above. Constant values of total 35S-labeled cellular proteins were utilized for each experimental point. After the addition of 0.1% BSA, the cell lysates were incubated with rabbit preimmune serum overnight at 4 °C, and nonspecific complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. The clarified supernatants were then incubated either with anti-GCase or anti-Sap C antiserum. Cross-reacting material was precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. The immunocomplexes were washed four times with PBS containing 1% BSA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate, and then with only PBS. The washed precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Labeled proteins were detected by fluorography. Fluorescence Microscopy—For fluorescence microscopy, the cells were grown on Labteck chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then rinsed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.05% saponin for 7 min, and incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. For intracellular free unesterified Chol staining, fixed cells were incubated with filipin solution (0.05% in PBS) for 30 min. The cells were observed with a UV 330–380 filter. For double immunostaining, the cells were incubated for 1 h with a specific rabbit polyclonal primary antibody (anti-Sap C or polyclonal anti-GCase), rinsed twice with PBS, and incubated for 1 h with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were then rinsed twice with PBS, incubated for 1 h with a specific mouse monoclonal primary antibody (anti-GCase (8E4), anti-LAMP1, or anti-LBPA), rinsed twice with PBS, and incubated with the secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Finally, the cells were mounted with ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) and observed with an Olympus BX52 fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters. The images were acquired using the IAS 2000 software. When specified, the fluorescence was viewed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS 4D apparatus equipped with an argon-krypton laser, double-dichroic splitters (488/568 nm), 520-nm barrier filter for Alexa Fluor-488 (green), and 590-nm barrier filter for Alexa Fluor-594 (red) observations. Image acquisition and processing were conducted by using SCANware, Multicolor Analysis (Leica Lasertechnik, GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), and Adobe Photoshop software programs. Signals from different fluorescent probes were taken in parallel, and colocalization was detected in yellow. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-Sap C (1:300), monoclonal anti-GCase (1:300), polyclonal anti-GCase (1:100), anti-LAMP1 (1:200), and anti-LBPA (1:80). GCase Activity and Mass Are Reduced in NPC Fibroblasts— GCase activity has been reported to be markedly diminished in NPC cells (22Besley G.T.N. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 752: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the GCase activity was ∼400 nmol/h/mg of protein in normal fibroblasts, whereas it was reduced to 75–100 nmol/h/mg protein (about 20% of the normal value) in cell lines from two NPC patients who lacked the NPC1 protein (NPC1a and NPC1b). Thus, much less functional GCase is present in NPC1 fibroblasts as a consequence of either a reduction or inactivation of the enzyme protein. To examine the first possibility, the GCase mass was analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-GCase antibody. The intensity of the enzyme bands in both the NPC1 cell lines was ∼80% weaker than in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 1, inset), indicating that much less protein was present. Thus, the difference in activity between the control and the mutated cells correlates well with differences in the enzyme mass. GCase Activity and Mass Are Modulated by Chol Accumulation—To address the possibility that the decreased amount of GCase is related to the accumulation of endolysosomal free Chol, the NPC1 cells were grown in LPDS medium. It is known that NPC cells no longer accumulate Chol when cultured for more than 2 days in lipoprotein-free medium (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Morris J.A. Carstea E. Neufeld E.B. Blanchette-Mackie J.E. Pentchev P.G. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York2001: 3611-3633Google Scholar). Accordingly, the free Chol level was dramatically reduced upon removal of low density lipoproteins, as indicated by the cytochemical filipin-staining of the NPC1 cells (data not shown). The GCase activity increased 3–4 times after 7 days of subculture with LPDS (Fig. 2A), and a parallel increase of the GCase protein was observed (Fig. 2B). When normal fibroblasts cells are grown in lipoprotein-free medium for 7 days, we observed a ∼20% increase of the GCase activity (from about 400 to 450–480 nmol/h/mg), whereas in NPC1 cells, the increase of activity was ∼250% (from about 100 to 300–350 nmol/h/mg). Thus, the level of free Chol in the endolysosomal system is able to modulate the level of GCase protein. Maturation of GCase in NPC1 Cells—To investigate at which step of maturation the amount of GCase decreased in the NPC1 cells, the biosynthesis and processing of the enzyme was examined by pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 3). According to previous findings (29Erickson A.H. Ginns E.I. Barranger J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14319-14324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Jonsson L.M.V. Murray G.J. Sorrell S.H. Strijland A. Aerts J.F.G.M. Ginns E.I. Barranger J.A. Tager J.M. Schram A.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a GCase precursor form (about 62 kDa) in normal fibroblasts was observed after a pulse of 1 h. A band at higher molecular mass (about 65 kDa) appeared after a 24-h chase. The fibroblast chased for 72 h contained an additional 58-kDa band of mature GCase. A similar pattern was observed in NPC1 fibroblasts. The densitometric quantitation of the intensity of the bands revealed that the amount of the 62-kDa precursor formed during a 1-h pulse was essentially the same in both control and NPC1 cells. In contrast, after a 72-h chase, much less GCase was detected in NPC1 than in control fibroblasts. These results indicate that the stability of the mature forms of GCase is markedly decreased in NPC1 cells. Maturation of Sap C in NPC1 Cells—Sap C, a small glycoprotein (about 10 kDa) derived from a large molecular mass precursor, prosaposin (65–70 kDa) (31Fujibayashi S. Wenger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15339-15343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is the specific activating and stabilizing factor of GCase (11O'Brien J. Kishimoto Y. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). A possible cause of the GCase instability in NPC1 cells might be a reduced amount of Sap C. To test this hypothesis, the biosynthesis and maturation of Sap C have been examined. As shown in Fig. 4, the amount of the prosaposin 65- to 70-kDa forms detected after pulse-labeling for 1 h and the amount of Sap C generated after 72 h of chase were nearly the same in normal and NPC1 fibroblasts. Thus, the instability of GCase in NPC1 cells simply cannot be ascribed to a lack of Sap C. Nevertheless, it must be noted that during a chase of 5 h, about 50% of prosaposin was converted to the mature saposin in normal fibroblasts, although only 5–15% was cleaved in NPC1 cells. This finding, consistent upon repetition, indicates that the prosaposin processing was retarded in the mutated cells. Subcellular Localization of GCase, Sap C, and LBPA—Our previous findings showed that the activity of GCase is efficiently expressed only when the enzyme is bound to membranes containing anionic phospholipids (19Salvioli R. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Vaccaro A.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Maras B. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sap C, which preferentially interacts with these lipids (17Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), in turn promotes the association of GCase with the lipid surface. According to this model, it can be expected that GCase, Sap C, and LBPA, the most abundant anionic phospholipid of the endolysosomal compartment (33Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), colocalize in the same regions of the late endosomal/lysosomal membranes in control fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 5, double-immunostaining revealed a complete colocalization of GCase and Sap C, as evident in the merged images. Moreover, all of the vesicular structures that contained GCase and Sap C also contained the anionic phospholipid LBPA. The late endosomal/lysosomal localization of GCase and Sap C was confirmed by the complete colocalization of the two proteins with LAMP1, a typical endolysosomal marker (Fig. 6).Fig. 6GCase and Sap C colocalize with LAMP 1 in normal fibroblasts. Normal human fibroblasts were double-immunostained for LAMP1 and either Sap C (top panels) or GCase (bottom panels), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All vesicles containing LAMP1 were also GCase-positive and Sap C-positive. Note that GCase was visualized with a polyclonal antibody (red, bottom left panel). Bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether an altered subcellular distribution might be responsible of the GCase instability, we performed the same immunofluorescence tests in NPC1 cells. As shown in Fig. 7, extensive storage of free Chol was observed in the two NPC1 cell lines (NPC1a and NPC1b), as visualized by the characteristic staining with filipin. Fig. 7 also shows that some cells staining for Chol were almost devoid of GCase. This observation was quantified by scoring NPC1a and NPC1b cells for GCase staining (n = 20 fields for each cell line). The enzyme was nearly absent in about 50% of the cells, an observation in keeping with the low amount of GCase found in the fibroblast homogenates (see Fig. 1). Immunofluorescence microscopy furthermore revealed that GCase distributed toward the periphery of vesicles in enlarged rings containing a heavy burden of Chol. The segregation of GCase toward the periphery of vesicular structures was constantly observed in NPC1 fibroblasts. In cells in which a significant amount of GCase was present, double-immunostaining showed the non-coincidence of the GCase distribution with those of LBPA and Sap C (Fig. 8). Also, the colocalization of Sap C with LBPA was impaired (Fig. 8). The intracellular distribution of GCase and Sap C was further defined by Laser scanning confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 9, the contact among GCase and its activating and stabilizing factor, Sap C, is rare in NPC1 cells, whereas the two proteins completely colocalize in control fibroblasts.Fig. 9Comparison of the GCase and Sap C localization in normal and NPC1 fibroblasts. NPC1 (top panels) and normal (bottom panels) fibroblasts were double-immunostained for GCase (green) and Sap C (red) and observed by laser scanning microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The right panels show an enlargement of the regions outlined by the boxes in the overlaid panels. The comparison of the overlaid images clearly shows that, in normal fibroblasts, the intracellular vesicles are yellow, indicating that each contains both GCase and Sap C, whereas in NPC1 cells, most of the vesicles are either green or red, indicating that the two proteins reside in distinct vesicles. Bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the depletion of Chol results in a dramatic increase of both the GCase mass and activity (see Fig. 2), we have investigated whether a reduction of the Chol level could also re-establish the colocalization of GCase with Sap C. The NPC1 cells were cultured for 7 days in medium containing LPDS. After this time, the morphology of the cells changed, and the filipin staining was no more detectable. As shown in Fig. 10, the decrease of Chol storage actually restored the colocalization of GCase with Sap C. In addition to an impairment in Chol trafficking, the NPC cells are characterized by an extensive endolysosomal accumulation of SL. Previous studies have shown that"
https://openalex.org/W1978112031,"The molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the balance between cellular proliferation and differentiation remain poorly understood. Members of the Ets-domain family of transcription factors are candidates for proteins that might differentially regulate cell cycle control and cell type-specific genes during the differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells. The Ets repressor PE-1/METS has been suggested to contribute to growth arrest during terminal macrophage differentiation by repressing Ets target genes involved in Ras-dependent proliferation. An important feature of this regulatory model is that PE-1/METS is itself induced by the program of macrophage differentiation elicited by M-CSF. Here, we present evidence that the <i>PE-1/METS</i> gene is a transcriptional target of the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein-1 (CREB-1). CREB-1 expression is dramatically up-regulated during macrophage differentiation and phosphorylation of CREB-1 and the related factor CREM-1 are stimulated by M-CSF in a SAPK2/p38-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that CREB-1/CREM-1 are recruited to the <i>PE-1/METS</i> promoter as well as to the promoters of other genes that are up-regulated during terminal macrophage differentiation. Overexpression of CREB-1 stimulates the activities of the <i>PE-1/METS,</i> and macrosialin promoters, while expression of a dominant negative form of CREB-1 during macrophage differentiation inhibits expression of the <i>PE-1/METS</i> and macrosialin genes. Inhibition of CREB function also results in reduced expression of CD54 and impaired cell adhesion. Taken together, these findings reveal new roles of CREB-1/CREM-1 as regulators of macrophage differentiation."

DNA binding to cells is saturable and inhibited by excess DNA, consistent with a receptor-mediated process (17McCoy S.L. Hausman F.A. Deffebach M.E. Bakke A. Merkens L.S. Bennett R.M. Hefeneider S.H.

Binding and internalization of exogenous DNA is a characteristic of most cell types and is non-sequence-restricted, and various forms (circular, linear, double-stranded, single-stranded) and types (bacterial, mammalian) of DNA bind and cross-compete with each other. The molecular characterization of the cell surface receptor responsible for the binding and internalization of exogenous DNA remains undefined (37Siess D.C. Vedder C.T. Merkens L.S. Tanaka T. Freed A.C. McCoy S.L. Heinrich M.C. Deffebach M.E. Bennett R.M. Hefeneider S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33655-33662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because internalization of DNA is required for cell activation, we questioned whether exposure of cells to CpG DNA would affect cell surface DNA binding and internalization. In this study we demonstrate that treatment of RAW264.7 murine macrophages with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), Escherichia coli DNA, or LPS leads to increased cell surface DNA binding. Enhanced DNA binding and internalization may represent one component of the host immune activation response, like cytokine secretion and induction of co-stimulatory molecules, that is regulated by the interaction of bacterial PAMPs and TLRs. Nuclease-resistant phosphorylated oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Oligos, Inc. (Wilsonville, OR). The sequences were 5′-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3′ (CpG ODN, designated ODN1826) and 5′-TCCAATGAGCTTCCTGAGTCT-3′ (non-CpG ODN, designated ODN1745) (38Yi A.K. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4493-4497PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse IL-1α and mouse TNF-α were obtained from R&D Systems. E. coli, calf thymus DNA, PMA, and LPS were purchased from Sigma. RAW264.7 (murine monocyte/macrophage) cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator and grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FCS, 1.5 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. RAW264.7 cells (2 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and then treated with medium, LPS, CpG ODN, or non-CpG ODN at the indicated concentrations and time periods. After treatment the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in DMEM containing 1% FCS, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2, and assessed for either cell surface DNA binding or DNA internalization as described below. DNA, pGEM-4Z plasmid (Promega), non-CpG ODN, or CpG ODN were labeled with YOYO-1 iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a cyanine fluorochrome that is 100–1000 times more fluorescent in the nucleic acid-bound form than in the free form. YOYO-1-DNA binding is high affinity, preventing the migration of YOYO-1 label from one DNA molecule to another. YOYO-1 (0.2 μm) and DNA (18 μg/ml) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in assay medium (phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), 1% FCS, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2,). RAW264.7 cells were grown in monolayers in T75 flasks until nearly confluent. The medium was removed, and cells were lifted with 8 mm EDTA and gentle scraping and collected into a single cell suspension. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended at 10 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM containing 1% FCS, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2. Cells were DNased and RNased by adding 250 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease I (Worthington Biochemical) and ribonuclease A (Worthington Biochemical). After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, EDTA (10 mm) was added to stop the action of the DNase and RNase, and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell surface DNA Binding—Cell surface DNA binding experiments were performed in 96-well V-bottom plates (Costar). 0.5 × 106 cells and YOYO-DNA (0.39–13.3 μg/ml) were added to the wells in quadruplicate in 200 μl/well assay medium. The plates were incubated in the dark at 4 °C for 30 min, as described previously (17McCoy S.L. Hausman F.A. Deffebach M.E. Bakke A. Merkens L.S. Bennett R.M. Hefeneider S.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 241: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined by preincubating cells with 100× calf thymus DNA (Sigma). After a 30-min incubation, the plates were washed twice with assay medium and resuspended in 300 μl of assay medium and 1 μg of 7-aminoactinomycin D (Molecular Probes), added to identify dead cells. Cells were incubated for 20 min on ice in the dark and analyzed by FACScan. Internalization of DNA—Cells were resuspended in DMEM, 1% FCS, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 (DMEM assay media). Internalization experiments were performed in 96-well V-bottom plates (Costar), with 0.5 × 106 cells and YOYO-DNA (1.35 and 3.6 μg/ml) added to the wells, in quadruplicate, in 200 μl/well DMEM assay media. Nonspecific binding was determined by preincubating cells with 200× calf thymus DNA (Sigma). The plates were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 3 h and washed twice with assay media, and the cells were resuspended in 300 μl of assay media and 1 μg 7-aminoactinomycin D (Molecular Probes). The cells were incubated for 20 min on ice in the dark, 2.5 μl of 0.4% trypan blue stain was added to quench cell surface binding, and DNA internalization was quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACScan, BD Biosciences). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using Cellquest software. Gates were drawn to exclude dead cells based on 7-aminoactinomycin D staining. Data obtained were geometric mean fluorescent units (F) with background autofluorescence subtracted. TNF-α levels were quantified from cell-free supernatants according to the manufacturer's directions, using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems (R&D Systems). Activation with CpG ODN Increases Cell Surface DNA Binding on RAW264.7 Cells—Because binding and internalization of DNA is required for cell activation by bacterial DNA (16Hacker H. Mischak H. Miethke T. Liptay S. Schmid R. Sparwasser T. Heeg K. Lipford G.B. Wagner H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6230-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), we questioned whether exposure of cells to CpG ODN would affect cell surface DNA binding. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that 1 μg/ml CpG ODN induced activation of RAW264.7 cells as assessed by quantification of cytokine activity (data not shown). Therefore, this concentration of CpG ODN was examined for its effect on DNA binding. RAW264.7 cells were treated for 4, 18, or 42 h with either 1 μg/ml non-CpG ODN or CpG ODN, washed, and assessed for cell surface DNA binding by FACScan. In these experiments, YOYO-CpG ODN was used for assessment of cell surface DNA binding. Treatment with CpG ODN significantly increased cell surface DNA binding on RAW264.7 cells at both 18 and 42 h compared with treatment with non-CpG ODN (Fig. 1A). Cell surface DNA binding approximately doubled after treatment with CpG ODN for either 18 or 42 h, with the overall binding greatest after 18 h of treatment. Treatment of cells with CpG ODN for 4 h had no effect on cell surface DNA binding compared with treatment with non-CpG ODN. Using an 18-h time point, multiple doses of both CpG ODN and non-CpG ODN were incubated with RAW264.7 cells, and cell surface DNA binding was examined (Fig. 1B). RAW264.7 cells were treated with 0.5, 1, or 3.0 μg/ml non-CpG ODN or CpG ODN, washed, and assessed for cell surface DNA binding by FACScan. Treatment with CpG ODN significantly increased cell surface DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner at all three CpG ODN concentrations compared with treatment with non-CpG ODN. No dose response was seen with non-CpG-treated cells. Increased Cell Surface DNA Binding Is Non-sequence-specific and Consistent with Increased Receptor Expression—DNA binding to cell surfaces has been previously shown to be non-sequence-specific and receptor-mediated (17McCoy S.L. Hausman F.A. Deffebach M.E. Bakke A. Merkens L.S. Bennett R.M. Hefeneider S.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 241: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 36Maurer T. Heit A. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. O'Keeffe M. Bauer S. Lipford G.B. Vabulas R.M. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2356-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We questioned whether the enhanced DNA binding seen after treatment with CpG ODN demonstrated these same properties. Cell surface binding of three different forms of DNA (YOYO-pGEM DNA, YOYO-CpG ODN, and YOYO-non-CpG ODN) were all increased on RAW264.7 cells treated for 18 h with 1 μg/ml CpG ODN (Fig. 2). For each type of DNA examined there was an approximately 2-fold increase in cell surface binding. The intensity of cell surface DNA binding as quantified by FACScan was greatest when pGEM DNA was used because this larger DNA binds more of the fluorescent YOYO-1 dye compared with the smaller non-CpG ODN and CpG ODN. Treatment of cells with non-CpG ODN for 18 h had no effect on cell surface DNA binding compared with non-treated cells (Fig. 2). Receptor-mediated binding is characterized by inhibition with excess unlabeled ligand and saturation of ligand binding over increasing concentrations. To test for inhibition of DNA binding, RAW264.7 cells were treated for 18 h with either non-CpG ODN or CpG ODN and then treated with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled DNA before cell surface DNA binding was examined. Unlabeled DNA effectively competed for binding, reducing the fluorescence of YOYO-CpG ODN to background (Fig. 3). To test for saturation of binding, RAW264.7 cells were treated for 18 h with either non-CpG ODN or CpG ODN, and cell surface DNA binding was examined over varying concentrations of YOYO-CpG ODN (Fig. 4). Both binding curves showed saturable binding (at ∼4 μg/ml YOYO-CpG ODN), with CpG ODN-treated cells saturating at a higher mean fluorescence than non-CpG ODN-treated cells; these data are consistent with increased receptor expression. Affinity of DNA binding, approximated by examining the amount of non-labeled DNA required for 50% inhibition of maximal DNA binding, showed no difference in DNA binding affinity between cells treated with either non-CpG ODN or CpG ODN (data not shown). Increased DNA binding on CpG ODN-treated cells is non-sequence-specific and is consistent with increased cell surface DNA receptors.Fig. 3Cell surface DNA binding on RAW264.7 cells is inhibited by excess DNA. RAW264.7 cells were treated with medium (hatched bars), 1 μg/ml non-CpG ODN (open bars), or 1 μg/ml CpG ODN (solid bars) for 18 h, and cell surface binding of YOYO-DNA (3.6 μg/ml) was assessed in the presence and absence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled calf thymus (C. T.) DNA by FACScan.

RAW264.7 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml CpG ODN (•) or 1 μg/ml non-CpG ODN (▪) for 18 h, and cell surface binding of YOYO-DNA was assessed by FACScan at varying concentrations (0.1–13.5 μg/ml). Nonspecific binding was determined by incubation at each concentration of YOYO-DNA with excess unlabeled calf thymus DNA and subtracted from total binding. Data are represented as the geometric mean fluorescence ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activation with CpG ODN Increases DNA Internalization—We next questioned whether increased cell surface DNA binding, seen after treatment with CpG ODN, would lead to enhanced internalization of DNA. RAW264.7 cells were treated for 18 h with either 1 μg/ml non-CpG ODN or CpG ODN; the cells were washed, and DNA internalization was quantified after 3 h at 37 °C by FACScan, after quenching cell surface binding. Cells treated with CpG ODN showed significant increase in the amount of YOYO-CpG ODN internalized compared with cells treated for 18 h with either medium or non-CpG ODN. An approximate 3-fold increase in internalization of DNA over background was observed in cells treated with CpG ODN, with enhanced internalization of YOYO-CpG ODN seen at both 1.35 μg/ml (Fig. 5A) and 3.6 μg/ml (Fig. 5B) YOYO-DNA. To determine whether increased DNA internalization was specific for DNA or represented nonspecific uptake, RAW264.7 cells were treated with medium, non-CpG ODN or CpG ODN, for 18 h and then treated with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled DNA before assessment of DNA internalization. In contrast to blocking of cell surface binding (Fig. 3), pretreatment of CpG ODN-activated cells with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled calf thymus DNA did not completely inhibit internalization of YOYO-CpG ODN (Fig. 5). These data suggest that enhanced DNA internalization seen after treatment of cells with CpG ODN results primarily but not exclusively from augmentation of a response that is specific for internalization of DNA. Increased DNA Binding Is Seen after Cell Activation by Bacterial PAMPs but Not with Non-bacterial Cell Activators—To begin to address the mechanism by which cell surface DNA receptors are increased, RAW264.7 cells were treated with either E. coli DNA or LPS, both of which are bacterial PAMPs that are potent activators of RAW264.7 cells; however, these agents use different TLR recognition structures. RAW264.7 cells were treated with non-CpG ODN (1 μg/ml), CpG ODN (1 μg/ml), calf thymus DNA (10 μg/ml), E. coli DNA (10 μg/ml), or LPS (1 ng/ml and 3 ng/ml). Cells were treated for 18 h, and cell surface DNA binding was quantified by FACScan. As expected, treatment with CpG ODN increased cell surface DNA binding ∼2-fold compared with non-CpG ODN-treated cells (Fig. 6A). Treatment with E. coli DNA and LPS significantly increased cell surface DNA binding, but the effect was not as pronounced as that seen with CpG ODN (Fig. 6A). Calf thymus DNA had no effect on DNA binding, and the result was similar to that with medium alone (Fig. 6B). We next questioned what effect non-bacterial cell activators had on cell surface DNA binding. RAW264.7 cells were treated for 18 h with non-CpG ODN (1 μg/ml), CpG ODN (1 μg/ml), TNF-α (10 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml), IL-1α (10 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml), or PMA (1 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml). Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with TNF-α, IL-1α, or PMA resulted in cell activation as evidenced by secretion of cytokines (data not shown). However, the secreted cytokine levels were increased less than 10-fold compared with an approximately 100-fold increase in secreted cytokine levels seen after treatment of RAW264.7 cells with CpG ODN, E. coli DNA, or LPS. There was a modest increase in DNA binding when cells were treated with non-bacterial agents compared with medium-treated cells; however, this increase was similar in magnitude to treatment with non-CpG ODN and did not match the increase seen after treatment with CpG ODN (Tables I and II). These data demonstrate that activating cells with these agents was not sufficient to induce increased cell surface DNA binding and suggest the involvement of bacterial PAMPs and their interaction with TLRs in mediating increased cell surface DNA binding. As further evidence of the importance of the interaction of bacterial PAMPs/TLRs, we examined the effect of CpG ODN using HEK293 cells. These cells bind and internalize DNA, but because they lack TLR9 they do not become activated on internalization of bacterial DNA. Incubation of HEK293 cells with CpG ODN specifically for human cells had no effect on cell surface DNA binding, compared with non-CpG ODN (data not shown). We have noted that cell surface DNA binding on HEK293 cells increased non-treated cells; however, no differences were seen between specific treatments (data not shown). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that increased cell surface DNA binding is one component of the cell activation profile resulting from the interaction of bacterial PAMPs and TLRs.Table ICell surface DNA binding on activated RAW264.7 cellsTreatmentMean fluorescence ± S.D.Medium14.22 ± 0.34Non-CpG ODN (1.0 μg/ml)22.08 ± 0.27CpG ODN (1.0 μg/ml)32.54 ± 1.28IL-1 (10 ng/ml)16.46 ± 0.60IL-1 (100 ng/ml)19.12 ± 0.47TNF-α (10 ng/ml)18.54 ± 0.42TNF-α (100 ng/ml)15.19 ± 0.56 Open table in a new tab Table IICell surface DNA bindingTreatmentMean fluorescence ± S.D.Non-CpG ODN (1.0 μg/ml)19.34 ± 0.16CpG ODN (1.0 μg/ml)39.66 ± 1.24PMA (1 ng/ml)23.80 ± 0.45PMA (10 ng/ml)20.09 ± 1.15 Open table in a new tab Cell-free Supernatants from Activated RAW264.7 Cells Do Not Increase Cell Surface DNA Binding Compared with Treatment with CpG ODN—We next questioned whether the increase seen after incubation with bacterial PAMPs was the result of direct interaction with PAMPs/TLRs or secondary stimulation by a soluble factor released when cells were treated by CpG ODN or LPS. RAW264.7 cells were treated for 3 h with non-CpG ODN (1 μg/ml), CpG ODN (1 μg/ml), LPS (1 ng/ml), or IL-1α (10 ng/ml), washed, and fresh media added for an additional 24 h. Cell-free supernatants were collected from treated cells and incubated with fresh non-treated cells for 18 h, and cell surface DNA binding was assessed by FACScan. Incubation of RAW264.7 cells with supernatants from CpG ODN-, LPS-, or IL-1α-treated cells showed a modest increase in cell surface DNA binding compared with supernatants from non-treated or non-CpG ODN-treated cells (Fig. 7). This effect on cell surface DNA binding did not approach the 2-fold increase seen after treatment of fresh cells for 18 h with CpG ODN (Fig. 7). Increased cell surface DNA binding does not appear to be mediated by a soluble product produced by incubation of RAW264.7 cells with CpG ODN or LPS. Increased Internalization of DNA Does Not Lead to Enhanced Cytokine Secretion—The increase in cell surface DNA binding and internalization seen on RAW264.7 cells treated with CpG ODN was shown to occur between 18 and 42 h. We questioned whether cells with enhanced capacity to bind and internalize DNA would be more responsive to subsequent exposure to CpG ODN. RAW264.7 cells were treated with medium, non-CpG ODN (1 μg/ml), or CpG ODN (1 μg/ml) for 24 h, and cell-free supernatants (24-h supernatants) were collected. Treated cells were then restimulated with medium, 1 μg/ml non-CpG ODN, or 1 μg/ml CpG ODN for an additional 24 h, and a second set of cell-free supernatants (48-h supernatants) were collected, and both 24- and 48-h supernatants were assayed for TNF-α activity (Table III). As expected, 24-h supernatants from CpG ODN-treated cells showed a substantial increase in TNF-α activity (8,912 pg/ml) compared with supernatants from medium (91 pg/ml) or non-CpG ODN-treated (91 pg/ml) cells. However, 48-h supernatants from CpG ODN-treated cells that were restimulated with CpG ODN showed a significant decrease in TNF-α activity (3,181 pg/ml) compared with the 24-h supernatants (8,912 pg/ml) from CpG ODN-treated cells. Our data demonstrate that whereas exposure to CpG ODN increases cell surface DNA binding and internalization, during this period the cells are hyporesponsive to continued stimulation by CpG ODN. The biological significance of increasing cell surface DNA binding and internalization following interaction with bacterial PAMPs may be to provide a mechanism to down-regulate an ongoing immune inflammatory response by enhancing clearance of bacterial DNA from the extracellular environment.Table IIICytokine secretion by activated RAW264.7 cellsTreatmentsTNF-α activityDay 1Day 224-h sup48-h suppg/ml ± S.D.Medium91 ± 20MediumMedium102 ± 37Non-CpG ODN91 ± 27Non-CpG ODNMedium87 ± 26Non-CpG ODNNon-CpG ODN146 ± 51CpG ODN8912 ± 1872CpG ODNMedium1181 ± 207CpG ODNCpG ODN3181 ± 766 Open table in a new tab The results of the present study demonstrate that activation of macrophages with CpG ODN resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in DNA binding and internalization. Increased cell surface DNA binding was seen at both 18 and 42 h after exposure to CpG ODN and was consistent with up-regulation of cell surface DNA receptors. Binding and internalizing of non-CpG ODN did not induce this response. Exposure to the bacterial PAMPs E. coli DNA and LPS increased DNA binding but not to the level seen with CpG ODN. To address the mechanism involved in increasing cell surface DNA binding, we questioned whether cell activation induced by non-bacterial products would affect DNA binding. In contrast to exposure to bacterial PAMPs, cell activation induced by IL-1α, TNF-α, or PMA did not affect DNA binding compared with non-CpG ODN. However, these results must be interpreted with caution because cell activation as assessed by cytokine secretion was significantly more effective when RAW264.7 cells were treated with CpG ODN, E. coli DNA, or LPS compared with treatment with IL-1α, TNF-α, or PMA. Exposure of HEK293 cells, which lack TLR9 and TLR4, to E. coli DNA or LPS did not influence cell surface DNA binding compared with non-CpG ODN, consistent with a postulated requirement that increased cell surface DNA binding requires cell activation initiated via interaction of bacterial PAMPs with their appropriate TLRs. Cell-free supernatants collected from cells activated with bacterial PAMPs did not increase cell surface DNA binding when incubated with fresh RAW264.7 cells, suggesting that direct PAMP/TLR interaction is required. Collectively, these data suggest that increased cell surface DNA binding results from the specific interaction of bacterial PAMPs and TLRs, is not a component of a general cell activation response, and is not mediated by production of a soluble factor in response to cell activation. During the period of increased DNA binding and internalization, RAW264.7 cells were shown to be hypo-responsive to continued stimulation by CpG ODN. We speculate that enhanced DNA binding and internalization in response to the interaction of PAMPs/TLRs may function to down-regulate an ongoing immune inflammatory response by enhancing clearance of bacterial DNA from the extracellular environment. Increased DNA binding and internalization seen after treatment with CpG ODN, E. coli DNA, and LPS may have application in the design of strategies for enhancing delivery of DNA-based therapies and therapeutic agents linked to DNA. Naked DNA has been used successfully in vivo for gene therapy; however, a major drawback has been its low efficiency for gene delivery (31Bennett R.M. Antisense Res.

Immunol. 2002; 32: 2356-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) demonstrated that linking of DNA to ovalbumin provided a significant advantage for antigen delivery compared with antigen alone. Enhanced delivery of DNA/antigen into cells was speculated to be because of binding and internalization of DNA by cell surface DNA receptors. Results of our study suggest that delivery of plasmid DNA and DNA/antigen into cells may be most efficient after first activating cells with bacterial DNA or LPS to enhance cell surface DNA binding and internalization. Our study, testing one design sequence of CpG ODN, resulted in a greater increase in cell surface DNA binding than either E. coli DNA or LPS. It may be possible to design CpG ODNs that would be more effective in enhancing cell surface DNA binding and internalization than the one used in our study. Recent studies reporting distinct stimulatory profiles specific to the class of CpG ODN and the importance of location and number of CpG motifs within a synthetic ODN to influence immunostimulatory capacity support this concept (4Krieg A.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 709-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 41Klinman D.M. Currie D. Clin. Exp.

The initial inflammatory response mounted by innate immune cells activated by bacterial PAMPs is followed by an active down-regulation, a process requiring the involvement of several factors. Evidence for this down-regulation is shown by studies that have found that continuous or repeated stimulation of innate immune cells with bacterial PAMPs affects the function of these cells differently than the initial stimulus. Significant reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been observed after cells were pre-stimulated with bacterial PAMPs, incubated for 24 h, and then restimulated with the same or other PAMPs (43Nomura F.

Immunol. 2003; 170: 1052-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) suggested that the observed hypo-responsiveness of macrophages to bacterial PAMPs was not because of cell exhaustion but rather a reprogramming of the cells. Our studies show that one consequence of exposure of RAW264.7 cells to CpG ODN, bacterial DNA, or LPS is increased cell surface DNA binding. The biological significance of cells binding and internalizing both bacterial and mammalian DNA remains unknown. Bennett et al. (34Bennett R.M. Gabor G.T. Merritt M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 2182-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) first proposed that DNA binding and internalization function as a salvage pathway for the breakdown of DNA into nucleotides with their subsequent reutilization within the cell. In certain autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus there is evidence of an autoantibody response to cell surface DNA receptors (48Bennett R.M. Peller J.S. Merritt M.J. Lancet. 1986; i: 186-188Abstract Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, these anti-DNA receptor antibodies function in vitro to block DNA binding to cells. One postulated consequence of this autoantibody response is impaired clearance of DNA and nucleosomes and the potential development of DNA-anti-DNA immune complexes with pathogenic significance (49Bennett R.M. Kotzin B.L. Merritt M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 850-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that enhanced DNA binding and internalization on immune cells activated by bacterial PAMPs could be a mechanism for clearance of extracellular DNA, as opposed to a means to further activate cells through increased interaction of bacterial DNA with TLR9. Up-regulation of binding to further activate a pro-inflammatory response initiated by bacterial PAMPs seems unlikely. Our data demonstrated that CpG ODN-treated RAW264.7 cells, with increased cell surface DNA binding and internalization, showed a reduced production of TNF-α in response to a secondary stimulation with CpG ODN. A potential host advantage of enhanced DNA binding and internalization would be to facilitate removal of DNA from the surrounding extracellular environment. Removal of extracellular DNA once an inflammatory response has been initiated may prevent stimulation of non-activated immune cells thereby helping to limit or contain an ongoing inflammatory response. Prolonged or chronic inflammation results when down-regulation is dysfunctional, and the uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines can result in inflammatory responses that are harmful to the host. Recent studies (50Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (11417) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that chronic inflammation is linked to several diseases with the development of effective anti-inflammatory therapies being an area of active investigation. The results of our current study suggest that enhanced cell surface DNA binding and internalization is one component of the activation response that develops when innate immune cells encounter bacterial PAMPs in the context of TLRs. If increased DNA binding is used as a clearance mechanism to facilitate down-regulation of the inflammatory response, enhanced cell surface DNA binding and internalization may provide a potential regulatory point to target for anti-inflammatory intervention.

https://openalex.org/W2326926638,"ID1 is a member of the inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation (ID) family of dominant negative helix–loop–helix transcription factors. ID-proteins have been implicated in the control of differentiation and transcriptional modulation of various cell cycle regulators and high levels of ID1 expression are frequently detected in various cancer types. However, it is unclear whether ID1 is a marker of highly proliferative cancer cells or whether it directly contributes to the tumor phenotype. A detailed analysis of ID1-expressing human cells revealed that a fraction of ID1 localizes to centrosomes. Ectopic expression of ID1 in primary cells and tumor cell lines resulted in accumulation of cells with abnormal centrosome numbers. There was no evidence for centrosomal localization or induction of centrosome abnormalities by the other ID family members. Hence, ID1 may contribute to oncogenesis not only by inhibiting transcriptional activity of basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors and abrogate differentiation but also by subverting centrosome duplication."
https://openalex.org/W2051667305,"The role of Thr-90 in the bacteriorhodopsin structure and function was investigated by its replacement with Ala and Val. The mutant D115A was also studied because Asp-115 in helix D forms a hydrogen bond with Thr-90 in helix C. Differential scanning calorimetry showed a decreased thermal stability of all three mutants, with T90A being the least stable. Light-dark adaptation of T90A was found to be abnormal and salt-dependent. Proton transport monitored using pyranine signals was ∼10% of wild type for T90A, 20% for T90V, and 50% for D115A. At neutral or alkaline pH, the M rise of these mutants was faster than that of wild type, whereas M decay was slower in T90A. Overall, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectra of T90A were strongly pH-dependent. Spectra recorded on films adjusted at the same pH at 243 or 277 K, dry or wet, showed similar features. The D115A and T90V FTIR spectra were closer to WT, showing minor structural differences. The band at 1734 cm-1 of the deconvoluted FTIR spectrum, corresponding to the carboxylate of Asp-115, was absent in all mutants. In conclusion, Thr-90 plays a critical role in maintaining the operative location and structure of helix C through three complementary interactions, namely an interhelical hydrogen bond with Asp-115, an intrahelical hydrogen bond with the peptide carbonyl oxygen of Trp-86, and a steric contact with the retinal.

The purple membrane patches of Halobacterium salinarum cells contain a single protein, bacteriorhodopsin (BR), 1The abbreviations used are: BR, bacteriorhodopsin; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: BR, bacteriorhodopsin; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; WT, wild type. which translocates protons from the interior to the exterior of the cell upon photon absorption by a retinal molecule (1Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2853-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). The native structure of bacteriorhodopsin consists of a bundle of seven densely packed α-helices forming a para-crystalline arrangement of BR trimers (2Henderson R. Unwin P.N.

Protein-protein and lipid-protein interactions as well as the lateral pressure exerted by the lipid chains on the protein molecules have important roles in this arrangement (9Curran A.R. Templer R.H. Booth P.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9328-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Weik M. Patzelt H. Zaccai G. Oesterhelt D. Mol.

Because of the high purple membrane density, the protein, in turn, should comply with some characteristics to allow the formation of the hexameric arrangement. Helix-helix interactions as well as retinal protein interactions are important elements involved in the BR compactness. When a relaxation of the protein structure occurs, the hexagonal arrangement appears impaired. One example refers to the bleached membrane, where the retinal absence compels the helices to lose several interactions (12Cladera J. Galisteo M.L. Sabés M. Mateo P.L. Padrós E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Moller C. Buldt G. Dencher N.A. Engel A. Muller D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 869-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Another case corresponds to the triple or quadruple mutants E9Q/E194Q/E204Q and E9Q/E74Q/E194Q/E204Q, which exhibit a more relaxed conformation as compared with WT (14Sanz C. Lazarova T. Sepulcre F.

IOS Press, Amsterdam2001: 120-136Google Scholar).The mutant T90A shows some characteristics indicative of a certain degree of softening of both the para-crystalline arrangement and the interactions within the seven-helix bundle. This is demonstrated by the decreased cooperativity and temperature of the differential scanning calorimetry pre-transition, as well as by a decreased temperature of the main transition (16Perálvarez A. Barnadas R. Sabés M. Querol E. Padrós E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because Thr-90 most probably does not form part of the proton transport chain (6Luecke H. Schobert B. Richter H.T. Cartailler J.P. Lanyi J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 7Facciotti M.T. Rouhani S. Burkard F.T. Betancourt F.M. Downing K.H. Rose R.B. McDermott G. Glaeser R.M. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3442-3455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it is likely that its importance relies on structural aspects. An earlier work already demonstrated the inability of the iodoacetic acid-derivatized T90C to fold normally in detergent/phospholipid micelles (17Flitsch S.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7800-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating that the -OH function and/or the side chain bulkiness is an important structural feature. According to the high-resolution BR structures, Thr-90 (helix C) and Asp-115 (helix D) form a hydrogen bond (Refs. 6Luecke H. Schobert B. Richter H.T. Cartailler J.P. Lanyi J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar and 7Facciotti M.T. Rouhani S. Burkard F.T. Betancourt F.M. Downing K.H. Rose R.B. McDermott G. Glaeser R.M. Biophys.

These two amino acids, which are conserved among various archaebacterial strains (18Ihara K. Umemura T. Katagiri I. Kitajima-Ihara T. Sugiyama Y. Kimura Y. Mukohata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Zhai Y. Heijne W.H. Smith D.W. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1511: 206-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), may be important in structural terms. Another significant structural interaction may be the hydrogen bond formed by the -OH group of Thr-90 with the peptide carbonyl oxygen of Trp-86, as bends and twists in transmembrane helices are induced by Thr through formation of an hydrogen bond with the backbone (20Gray T.M. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Ballesteros J.A. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The BR structural models effectively show a kink in helix C at this level (Fig. 1). On the other hand, Pro residues are known as helix-breaking residues, and, thus, the adjacent Pro-91 may contribute to bending the helix. Again, sequence comparison shows that Pro-91 is conserved (18Ihara K. Umemura T. Katagiri I. Kitajima-Ihara T. Sugiyama Y. Kimura Y. Mukohata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Finally, there are van der Waals contacts between the methyl group of Thr-90 and the retinal chain that may also be important for the correct location of retinal.In this work, we analyze in detail the behavior of the T90A, T90V, and D115A mutants to determine the structural and functional consequences of the disruption of the interactions involving the Thr-90 side chain. In the T90A mutant, we describe a chromoprotein with very different properties as compared with wild type BR, including a decrease in the efficiency of the proton transport and some critical alterations in the photocycle. In addition, the D115A and T90V mutations provide further knowledge about the role of the set of interactions involving Thr-90.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe construction and expression of T90A and D115A mutants in Halobacterium salinarum was carried out as described (14Sanz C. Lazarova T. Sepulcre F. González-Moreno R. Bourdelande J.L. Querol E. Padrós E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The mutant T90V was a generous gift from Dr. J. K. Lanyi.UV-visible spectra of dark- or light-adapted purple membrane suspensions (1.5·10-5m, and 3.5·10-5m in the case of T90A) were recorded with a Cary Bio3 spectrophotometer using an integrating sphere when necessary. The difference spectra were obtained by subtracting light-adapted minus dark-adapted samples.Flash-induced transient absorbance changes were monitored using a LKS50 instrument from Applied Photophysics. A Q-switched neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd-YAG) laser (Spectron Laser Systems; pulse width ∼9 ns; E = 5 mJ/pulse/cm2; repetition frequency 0.5 Hz) at 532 nm was used for light excitation. Transient pH changes in the bulk medium were followed by measuring the absorbance changes of 50 μm pyranine at 460 nm in a purple membrane suspension in 1 m KCl, pH 7 (22Grzesiek S. Dencher N.A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 337-342Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To obtain the net absorbance changes of pyranine, the traces of samples in the absence of the dye were subtracted from those in its presence. The negative signal of ΔΔA indicates the release of protons by BR (pyranine protonation), whereas the positive signal indicates BR proton uptake. Photocycle reactions of purple membrane suspensions of T90A and D115A mutants in 1 m KCl were followed by the acquisition of absorbance spectra at 410, 555, and 660 nm as a function of time at pH 6.5 and pH 10.Infrared experiments were performed at 277 and 243 K with wet and dry samples. The temperature was controlled and maintained using a homemade cell holder and a cryostat. Membrane samples were suspended in 150 mm KCl and either 3 mm carbonate-bicarbonate for pH 10 or3mm sodium phosphate for pH 7. Preparation of membrane films and spectra acquisition were done as described (23Lazarova T. Padrós E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8354-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with a Bio-Rad FTS6000 spectrometer at 2 cm-1 resolution. At least three cycles of 350 scans were averaged (i.e. at least 1050 interferograms were accumulated per spectrum). Difference spectra were calculated by subtracting unphotolyzed BR from the corresponding photointermediate. Absorption spectra were Fourier self-deconvoluted using the Kauppinnen algorithm (24Kauppinnen J.K. Moffatt D.J. Mantsch H.H. Cameron D.G. Anal. Chem. 1981; 53: 1454-1457Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar), with a Lorentzian band shape, a full width at a half-height of 10 cm-1, and a band narrowing factor k of 2. When necessary, films were illuminated with blue light to drive any remaining intermediate back to BR. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed as described previously (16Perálvarez A. Barnadas R. Sabés M. Querol E. Padrós E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).RESULTSLight-Dark Adaptation—Light-dark adaptation was found to be abnormal in T90A. Fig. 2 shows the absorbance and difference spectra (light-adapted minus dark-adapted) in water, 150 mm KCl, and 1 m KCl (pH 7, room temperature). In H2O, a decrease of the extinction coefficient and virtually no shift of the maximum upon illumination are observed. When the ionic strength is increased, a more normal behavior is observed (increase of the extinction coefficient and red shift upon light adaptation), due probably to the partial recovery of the normal isomer ratio in dark-adapted form. Under the conditions presented in Fig. 2, dark adaptation is very slow, taking at least 1 month to complete. In contrast, T90V and D115A show a normal dark adaptation, although all mutants present a shifted absorbance maxima as compared with WT (see Table I).Fig. 2Light-dark absorption spectra of T90A.Left column, absorption spectra of dark-adapted (dash-dot line) and light-adapted (solid line) membrane suspensions of T90A at pH 7 in water (A), 150 mm KCl (B), or 1 m KCl (C).

All mutants present a faster M rise and a slower M decay than WT (see Table I). Fig. 3A also shows that D115A presents a higher amount of O intermediate than T90A, T90V, or wild type and that T90A and T90V exhibit a longer-living O intermediate. At pH 10, like at neutral pH, the M rise of T90A and of T90V is faster and the M decay slower than those of the WT, whereas D115A has a faster M decay (Fig. 3B and Table I). On the other hand, at neutral or at alkaline pH, both the amplitude of the M intermediate (maximal signal at 410 nm) and the signal at the λmax of 555 nm (disappearance of the BR form) of T90A are ∼20% of the WT signal, whereas they are ∼40% for T90V and ∼50% for D115A. At pH 4, no signal was detected for T90A at any of the wavelengths analyzed, indicating the absence of photocycle intermediates under these conditions, whereas both T90V and D115A showed small signals (data not shown).Fig. 3Kinetics of photocycle intermediates. The traces show the absorption changes corresponding to the M intermediate (410 nm; top), BR depletion and recovery (555 nm for T90A, T90V and D115A and 570 nm for WT; middle), and the O intermediate (660 nm; bottom).

As is apparent, a weak signal is obtained for T90A and T90V, amounting to ∼10% of the WT signal for T90A and ∼20% for T90V. This is in keeping with the low accumulation of the M intermediate obtained at neutral pH and with the decreased pumping efficiency of T90A incorporated into liposomes, which was found to be <20% (16Perálvarez A. Barnadas R. Sabés M. Querol E. Padrós E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The signal of D115A also appears decreased, to ∼50% of the WT signal, again in accordance with the amplitude of the M intermediate for this mutant.Fig. 4Light-induced pyranine signals. Pyranine absorption changes were measured at 460 nm in suspensions of T90A, T90V, D115A, and WT in 150 mm KCl (pH 7) at 293 K.

On the other hand, we have found that the difference spectra depend mainly on the pH. As shown in Fig. 5A, the spectra taken at pH 10, at either 243 or 277 K, dry or wet, are similar to each other and relatively similar to the WT M1 intermediate spectrum (25Braiman M.S. Ahl P.L. Rothschild K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5221-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Asp-85 appears protonated (band at 1762–1763 cm-1), and a small negative band appears at 1747 cm-1 that is not present in the WT difference spectrum. The amide I is also somewhat changed in comparison to the WT M1 intermediate. The pair of bands at 1640 cm-1 (negative) and 1624 cm-1 (positive) indicate the presence of a protonated Schiff base in the unphotolyzed pigment and a deprotonated Schiff base in the M1-like intermediate. In the amide II, the C = C stretching band appears at 1530 cm-1, in keeping with the known inverse relationship with the λmax of the visible absorption spectrum, which is 550 nm at pH 10. On the other hand, the retinal negative peaks at 1201 and 1167 cm-1 indicate that the retinal is in the all-trans configuration in the unphotolyzed state (26Maeda A. Sasaki J. Pfefferle J.M. Shichida Y. Yoshizawa T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 911-921Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the small negative peak at 1276 cm-1 is not present, indicating that the conformational changes of the T90A photocycle do not affect Tyr-185 (27He Y. Krebs M.P. Fischer W.B. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2282-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Fig. 5FTIR difference spectra of T90A. The films were prepared from suspensions in 150 mm KCl at pH 10 (A) and pH 7 (B). Conditions were as follows: 1, dry sample at 277 K; 2, wet sample at 277 K; 3, dry sample at 243 K; and 4, wet sample at 243 K. The spectra are scaled so that all of them have the same intensity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)At pH 7 (Fig. 5B), the difference spectra depend more on the particular conditions, especially on the water content. The carboxylate band of Asp-85 is less evident, and it shifted to 1764–1768 cm-1, depending on the temperature and the state of the sample. The negative band at 1698 cm-1, which is particularly evident in the wet samples, probably corresponds to the band at 1692 cm-1 in WT and T90A at pH 10. This shift may indicate that the corresponding reverse turns of the unphotolyzed protein have a different structure in wet samples at pH 7 from those at pH 10. The positive band at 1509 cm-1 is also mainly seen in wet samples (Fig. 5B). It may be reminiscent of the band at 1506 cm-1, seen in the O difference spectra (28Zscherp C. Heberle J. J. Phys. Chem. 1997; 101: 10542-10547Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The most striking feature observed at pH 7 is the positive 1222 cm-1 peak, which again is more intense in wet samples and is accompanied by a low intensity of the 1200 cm-1 band. These features indicate that at neutral pH, the retinal adopts a distorted configuration in T90A as compared with WT. Difference spectra for D115A and T90V were more similar to WT, with only some deviation appearing in the amide I and in the fingerprinting region of the retinal (data not shown).Fig. 6A presents FTIR difference spectra collected under conditions of the N intermediate. D115A shows an N-like intermediate, whereas the main feature of T90A and T90V is an M-like intermediate (compare with the spectrum of WT). In D115A, the peak of protonated Asp-85 is shifted to a more M-like position (1761 cm-1), and the 1650 cm-1 peak corresponding to helical conformational changes is absent, as in T90A. The T90V mutant shows an M-like spectrum, although, as in D115A, a small positive band at 1186 cm-1 (characteristic of N) is present. Fig. 6B shows the absorbance FTIR spectra of WT, T90A, T90V, and D115A films at pH 7 in the carboxylate region after band narrowing by deconvolution. Two bands can be seen in the WT sample at 1734 and 1740 cm-1, which are assigned to Asp-115 and Asp-96, respectively (29Sasaki J. Lanyi J.K. Needleman R. Yoshizawa T. Maeda A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the mutants, the band at 1734 cm-1 is missing, whereas the band at 1740 cm-1 keeps its position in T90A and shifts to 1741 cm-1 in T90V and D115A. Similar spectra were found at pH 10 (data not shown). This indicates that, in T90A and T90V, the -COOH group of Asp-115 does not contribute to the carboxylate region and, thus, is most likely deprotonated at neutral or alkaline pH.Fig. 6N-like FTIR difference spectra and carboxylic region of the FTIR deconvoluted spectra of T90A, T90V, D115A, and WT.A, comparison of T90A, T90V, D115A, and WT FTIR difference spectra under conditions for WT to yield the N intermediate (pH 10, wet sample, at 277 K) 1, WT; 2, T90A; 3, T90V; and 4, D115A.

Fig. 7 shows the DSC scans after baseline subtraction. As is known, the WT purple membrane presents two transitions, namely the pre-transition, which is assigned to the reversible disorganization of the paracrystalline arrangement, and the main transition, which is caused by the irreversible (partial) protein denaturation. Fig. 7 shows that the mutations induce a clear destabilization. As described previously (16Perálvarez A. Barnadas R. Sabés M. Querol E. Padrós E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), T90A has the main transition at 83 °C and a decreased area of the transition curve, thus presenting a dramatic decrease in conformational stability as compared with WT (main transition at 98 °C). T90V and D115A show an intermediate behavior. They have the same main transition temperature (92 °C), but T90V shows a lower cooperativity. The mutations affect the pre-transition even more. As compared with WT, there is a decrease in the temperature of the pre-transition of 12 °C for D115A, 20 °C for T90V, and ∼30 °C for T90A. Additionally, an important decrease in cooperativity is observed, especially for T90V and T90A. Overall, these data indicate a more relaxed structure of the BR mutants, giving rise, in turn, to a decreased stability of the para-crystalline arrangement.Fig. 7DSC thermograms of wild type and mutants D115A, T90V, and T90A. Purple membrane patches were suspended in H2Oat a concentration of 2.0 mg/ml, pH 7. The curves were corrected with the instrumental and chemical baselines. Scans were taken at 1.5 K/min.

In accordance with our previous conclusions (16Perálvarez A. Barnadas R. Sabés M. Querol E. Padrós E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the results reveal Thr-90 as a key element in the structure of BR. Focusing on proton pumping, mutagenesis on Thr-90 yields a protein with a clear decrease in the proton-pumping ability. Thus, substitution of Thr-90 with Ala, which avoids all the interactions of residue 90, decreases the pumping efficiency to only ∼10% of the pyranine signal in comparison with WT. Similarly, substitution of Thr-90 with Val, which keeps the steric interaction with the retinal but loses the hydrogen bonds, shows a proton pumping ∼20% of that of WT. In accordance with this trend, the D115A mutant, which only loses the hydrogen bonding of Thr-90 with Asp-115, shows a proton pumping of ∼50% as compared with WT. Previous data on T90V expressed in Escherichia coli and reconstituted into liposomes also showed a somewhat decreased proton-pumping activity, although not as important as in our case (∼70%; Ref. 30Marti T. Otto H. Mogi T. Roesselet S.J. Heyn M.P. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6919-6927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas T90C showed similar proton pumping as WT (17Flitsch S.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7800-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be due to a more relaxed conformation of the protein in the monomeric state that is obtained by reconstitution, as compared with the crystalline lattice of purple membrane.The kinetics and yield of the photocycle intermediates constitute a valuable appraisal of the disruption of the function of BR produced by the mutations. First of all, the amount of M intermediate is much decreased in T90A compared with WT and is decreased to half of the value of WT in T90V and D115A, suggesting a back-reaction to the purple form from one of the intermediates preceding M. On the other hand, the M rise is faster than WT in all mutants at neutral or alkaline pH, whereas the M decay is slower in all mutants at both pH conditions, except for D115A, which shows faster M decay kinetics at alkaline pH. This indicates that the deprotonated state of the Schiff base, i.e. the M intermediate, is favored in T90A and T90V, in agreement with FTIR data (see Fig. 6A). On the other hand, the absorbance maximum and dark-light adaptation properties give information on the environment of the retinal chromophore. As described under “Results,” all three mutants show shifted absorbance maxima, but only T90A has abnormal dark-light adaptation kinetics. This means that the steric interaction between the methyl group of Thr-90 and the"

Understanding the mechanisms and structural basis for the inactivation of these inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases provides a rationale for the design of novel compounds. In the present work, SHV-1 and the Ser130 → Gly inhibitor-resistant variant of SHV-1 β-lactamase were inactivated with tazobactam, a potent class A β-lactamase inhibitor. Apoenzymes and inhibited β-lactamases were analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS), digested with trypsin, and the products resolved using LC-ESI/MS and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The mass increases observed for SHV-1 and Ser130 → Gly (+ Δ 88 Da and + Δ 70 Da, respectively) suggest that fragmentation of tazobactam readily occurs in the inhibitor-resistant variant to yield an inactive β-lactamase. These two mass increments are consistent with the formation of an aldehyde (+ Δ 70 Da) and a hydrated aldehyde (+ Δ 88 Da) as stable products of inhibition. Our results reveal that the Ser → Gly substitution at amino acid position 130 is not essential for enzyme inactivation. By examining the inhibitor-resistant Ser130 → Gly β-lactamase, our data are the first to show that tazobactam undergoes fragmentation while still attached to the active site Ser70 in this enzyme.

This class of antibiotics enjoys target specificity (bacterial cell wall synthesizing transpeptidases and carboxypeptidases) and safety. β-Lactamases (EC 3.5.2.6) threaten the continued efficacy of β-lactams. These ubiquitous enzymes are produced by a wide variety of microorganisms including anaerobic and aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Currently, there are nearly 470 β-lactamases assembled into four distinct molecular classes (classes A–D) or groups (Bush-Jacoby-Mederios Group 1–4) (1Bush K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001; 32: 1085-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 2Bush K. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 3: 1284-1290PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, www.lahey.org/studies/webt.asp). Classes A, C, and D are serine-reactive hydrolases that inactivate the β-lactam by acylation of the active site serine followed by hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. The class B enzymes are zinc-dependent hydrolases (3Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 4Galleni M.

Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2003; 3: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The increasing number of serine and metallo-β-lactamases with extended substrate specificity is seriously threatening the ability of clinicians to treat infections in the hospital, nursing home, and community settings. An urgent need exists to develop novel β-lactams.One of the most successful strategies used to overcome β-lactamase-mediated resistance is the use of β-lactamase inhibitors (6Page M.G. Drug Resist. Updat. 2000; 3: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These mechanism-based inhibitors act by covalently modifying the active site of class A β-lactamases. Tazobactam, sulbactam, and clavulanic acid are the current β-lactamase inhibitors used in clinical practice (Fig. 1). Each is coupled with a β-lactam antibiotic to improve the potency and longevity of the partner drug. Commercial preparations of β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitors available in the United States include piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn™), ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn™), amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin™), and ticarcillin/clavulanate (Timentin™). As a group, these β-lactamase inhibitors are primarily effective against susceptible class A β-lactamases.Unfortunately, single amino acid substitutions in the class A TEM and SHV families of β-lactamases have resulted in enzymes with reduced affinity for β-lactamase inhibitors. TEM and SHV β-lactamases that are resistant to inhibitors have alterations at Ambler positions Met69, Ser130, Arg244, Arg275, and Asp276 (7Ambler R.P. Coulson A.F. Frere J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Joris B.

By studying clavulanic acid inhibition of TEM-2 β-lactamase, four different mass increments relative to the uninhibited TEM-2 were found (+ Δ 52, 70, 88, and 155 Da) (22Brown R.P. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 24: 12421-12432Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The Ser70 and Ser130 amino acids were identified as modified residues in the inactivation process. Extending this work, Yang et al. (24Yang Y. Janota K. Tabei K. Huang N. Siegel M.M. Lin Y.I. Rasmussen B.A. Shlaes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26674-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the inactivation of PC 1 and TEM-1 β-lactamases by tazobactam results in four additions to PC 1 β-lactamase (+ Δ 52, 70, 88, and 300 Da) and three additions to TEM-1 β-lactamase (+ Δ 52, 70, and 88 Da). As in the case with clavulanic acid inactivation of TEM-2, the amino acids Ser70 and Ser130 were again the tazobactam-modified residues. Evidence for an aldehyde and hydrated aldehyde attached to Ser70 was found. A 70-Da increase in mass attached to the Ser130 residue was also detected. Hence, the critical involvement of Ser130 in the inactivation process, as first emphasized by Imitiaz et al. (25Imtiaz U. Billings E.M. Knox J.R. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5728-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), is central to the studies of the inhibition of class A β-lactamases by clavulanic acid and tazobactam.Investigations by Helfand et al. (26Helfand M.S. Bethel C.R. Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Anderson V.E. Bonomo R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52724-52729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) stressed that the relative differences in kinact values between SHV-1 and Ser130 → Gly, an inhibitor-resistant variant, were smaller than the differences in the dissociation constant for the pre-acylation complex, KI, for tazobactam and clavulanic acid. Furthermore, the apparent inhibitor to enzyme (I/E) ratios required to inactivate SHV-1 and Ser130 → Gly β-lactamases were similar; the inactivation process is hindered only by the affinities of clavulanic acid and tazobactam for the active site of the Ser130 → Gly variant. These observations led us to investigate the nature of the inhibited intermediates when Gly is substituted for Ser at position 130. Here we report the study of the inhibition reaction of SHV-1 and Ser130 → Gly-substituted SHV-1 β-lactamases with tazobactam by using LC-ESI/MS to determine the mass increase after the inhibition. Tryptic digests were analyzed using LC-ESI/MS and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Examining the inhibitor-resistant Ser130 → Gly β-lactamase, our data are the first to show that tazobactam undergoes fragmentation while still attached to the active site Ser70 in this enzyme. After acylation of tazobactam by Ser130 → Gly, we propose that inactivation proceeds independent of any additional modifications.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of SHV-1 and Ser130 → Gly-substituted β-Lactamases— The genetic constructs and Escherichia coli DH10B strains harboring the SHV-1 and Ser130 → Gly β-lactamases were described previously (8Hujer A.M.

SHV-1 and Ser130 → Gly β-lactamases were purified to greater than 95% homogeneity by preparative isoelectric focusing according to established procedures in our laboratory (10Helfand M.S. Hujer A.M.

The eluting and storage buffers for SHV-1 and Ser130 → Gly β-lactamases were 20 mm diethanolamine, pH 8.5.Inactivation of SHV-1 and Ser130 → Gly-substituted β-Lactamases by Tazobactam—SHV-1 β-lactamase (76 μm) and Ser130 → Gly-substituted SHV-1 β-lactamase (38 μm) stock solutions were used in these experiments. Sodium tazobactam (molecular mass 330 Da) was a kind gift from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (Pearl River, NY). Tazobactam was dissolved in HPLC grade water and mixed with SHV-1 and with the Ser130 → Gly β-lactamase in a molar ratio of 1000:1 (inhibitor/enzyme) at room temperature for 30 min. Immediately following the reaction, the inhibited enzymes were purified and characterized by the LC-MS procedure described below. All protein analyses were performed in HPLC grade water.LC-ESI/MS—The LC-ESI/MS analysis of all samples was performed using a Micromass (Beverly, MA) Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization interfaced to an Agilent (Colorado Springs, CO) 1100 series HPLC system as described previously (27Bonomo R.A. Liu J. Chen Y. Ng L. Hujer A.M. Anderson V.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The SHV-1, Ser130 → Gly β-lactamase, tazobactam-inactivated SHV-1, and the Ser130 → Gly enzymes were first separated on a C4 reverse phase column (1 × 150 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) from Vydac (Hesperia, CA). The mobile phase is a gradient mixture of A, 0.3% acetic acid in water, and B, 0.3% acetic acid in acetonitrile with a flow rate through the column of 45 μl/min. The gradient timetable was 2% B at 0 min and 80% B at 30 min, and the total run time was 60 min. The parameters for the ESI/MS are as follows: ionization mode was positive; cone voltage was 70 V; nitrogen was used both as a nebulizing and as a drying gas; the source temperature was 70 °C; capillary voltage was 3.5 kV; the spectra were obtained scanning over 800–2400 Da.Proteolysis—Sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to digest both uninhibited and tazobactam-inhibited SHV-1 and the Ser130 → Gly β-lactamases. The uninhibited and inactivated β-lactamases were denatured with 8 m urea at 50 °C for 30 min. The pH of the denaturation mixture was adjusted to 8 using 0.4 m NH4HCO3. After a 1:4 dilution with water, trypsin was added into the mixture at a β-lactamase/trypsin ratio of 25:1 (w/w) and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. Freezing the mixture at –40 °C terminated proteolysis. The digestion products were analyzed by LC-ESI/MS and by MALDI-TOF MS using the conditions described below.LC-ESI/MS for the Tryptic Digests—The tryptic digests of the uninhibited and tazobactam-inactivated β-lactamases were separated on a C18 column (1 × 150 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) (Vydac). The mobile phase was a gradient mixture of A, 0.3% acetic acid in water, and B, 0.3% acetic acid in acetonitrile from 2 to 80% B in 70 min with a flow rate through the column of 35 μl/min. The total run time was 120 min. The ESI/MS parameters were the same as described above, except that cone voltage was 45 V and the scanning range was 300–1700 Da.MALDI-TOF MS of the Tryptic Digests—The tryptic digests were analyzed using an Omniflex MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer from Bruker (Billerica, MA). Positive ionization and reflectron mode were used. The experimental parameters are as follows: laser power 60%, voltage 76.4%, and ion focus 9.2. The matrix was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. The internal standard consisted of bradykinin, renin substrate, and adrenocorticoid hormone fragments 18–39 and 7–38 (Sigma). The samples were de-salted using C18 Zip-Tips from Millipore (Bedford, MA) before mixing with the matrix.RESULTSLC-ESI/MS, MALDI-TOF MS, and the Inhibition of SHV-1 β-Lactamase—SHV-1 and tazobactam-inhibited SHV-1 β-lactamase were first separated and characterized using LC-ESI/MS. The scan mass spectra and the deconvoluted spectra for the chromatographic peaks of the enzymes are shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen, the molecular mass of the apoenzyme and tazobactam-inhibited SHV-1 β-lactamases measured by ESI/MS are 28,872 ± 3 and 28,959 ± 3 Da, respectively. This represents a mass increase of 87 ± 6 Da after inhibition. This additional mass is lower than the molecular mass of tazobactam indicating that a cleaved moiety of the inhibitor is covalently attached in the tazobactam-SHV-1 complex. The mass increment is consistent with the 88-Da increase seen in the tazobactam inactivation of PC 1 and TEM-1 and clavulanic acid inhibition of TEM-2 (22Brown R.P. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J.

Deconvoluted spectra for SHV-1 (A-2) and the tazobactam inhibited SHV-1 (B-2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To identify the amino acid site of attachment, the intact and inhibited SHV-1 were digested with trypsin, and the tryptic digests were analyzed by LC-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF MS. Twenty four peptides were identified by LC-ESI/MS from the tryptic digest, and 18 peptides were assigned by MALDI-TOF MS (Table I). We observed from the LC-ESI/MS data that the relative intensity of peptide 11 containing residues 66–73 (987.5 Da) and peptide 20 containing residues 62–73 (1458.7 Da) was dramatically decreased after tazobactam inhibition. As shown in Figs. 3A and 4A, the MALDI-TOF spectrum for the tryptic digest of the uninhibited SHV-1 had signals from the [M + H] ions of the 988.46 and 1459.7, respectively. However, the tryptic digest of the tazobactam-inhibited SHV-1 did not show the peaks for those peptides (Figs. 3B and 4B). These data indicate that the modification site is located between residues 66 and 73 of the SHV-1 β-lactamase. Hence, we demonstrate that a stable intermediate of inhibition of SHV-1 β-lactamase with tazobactam involves attachment of a fragment of this inhibitor to an amino acid segment containing Ser70. Based upon previous structural and ESI/MS studies, it is unlikely that Lys73 is the modified residue (17Kuzin A.P. Nukaga M. Nukaga Y. Hujer A. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R.

The mass difference between this new peak and the disappeared peptide peak at 988.5 m/z (residues 66–72) is 87.8 Da and is in excellent agreement with the mass increase of 87 ± 6 Da for SHV-1 after inhibition. This new peak with an m/z of 1076.3 establishes that a moiety with a mass of 88 Da is attached to the peptide with m/z 988.5.LC-ESI/MS, MALDI-TOF MS, and the Inhibition of Ser130 → Gly β-Lactamase—Ser130 → Gly and tazobactam-inhibited Ser130 → Gly variants of SHV-1 β-lactamase were studied in the same manner as the SHV-1 enzyme. By using LC-ESI/MS, we determined that the Ser130 → Gly β-lactamase had a mass increase of 70 ± 6 Da from 28,839 ± 3 to 28,909 ± 3 Da (Fig. 5) after inhibition with tazobactam.Fig. 5Scan mass spectra for Ser130 → Gly β-lactamase (A-1) and the tazobactam-inhibited Ser130 → Gly β-lactamase (B-1) obtained by LC-ESI/MS; deconvoluted spectra for Ser130 → Gly β-lactamase (A-2) and the inhibited Ser130 → Gly β-lactamase (B-2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The analyses of the tryptic digests of the Ser130 → Gly β-lactamase and inhibited Ser130 → Gly β-lactamase by LC-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF MS are presented in Figs. 6 and 7 and listed in Table II.

In this scheme, the Ser70-OH of Ser130 → Gly β-lactamase attacks the carbon of the carbonyl group in the β-lactam ring 1. This leads to the acyl-enzyme 2 that undergoes further reaction to generate a linear imine species 3 after thiazolidine ring opening and departure of the sulfinate from C-5. This linear imine leads to an enamine 4 via rearrangement. Addition of a water molecule to the imine 3 and/or enamine 4 yields an aldehyde 5 that has a 70-Da mass increase. For SHV-1, the hydration of the aldehyde 5 leads to the product 6 with an 88-Da mass increase. This pathway is consistent with our mass spectrometry studies, with detailed kinetic analysis of the Ser130 → Gly mutant of SHV-1 and other inhibitor-resistant enzymes, and is reminiscent of the reaction of CMY-2 β-lactamase with tazobactam (14Swaren P.

https://openalex.org/W2093756365,"We reported previously that interleukin-13 (IL-13) induces tyrosine phosphorylation/activation of Jak2 and Tyk2 kinases and Stats 1, 3, 5, and 6 in primary human monocytes. We recently revealed that p38 MAPK-mediated serine phosphorylation of both Stat1 and Stat3 is required for the induction of 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) expression by IL-13. In this study, we present data indicating that another serine/threonine kinase, PKCδ, is also required for IL-13-induced 15-LO expression. PKCδ, a member of the novel protein kinase C (PKC) subclass, was rapidly phosphorylated and activated upon exposure to IL-13. Treatment of cells with rottlerin, a PKCδ inhibitor, blocked IL-13-induced 15-LO mRNA and protein expression, whereas Go6976, an inhibitor of the conventional PKC subclass, had no inhibitory effects. Down-regulation of cellular PKCδ protein levels by PKCδ-specific antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides also inhibited 15-LO expression markedly. IL-13-induced 15-LO expression resulted in significant inhibition of synthesis of the potent chemotactic factor leukotriene B4, and that process was reversed by rottlerin, presumably through the blockage of PKCδ-dependent 15-LO expression. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that IL-13-mediated activation of PKCδ and p38 MAPK are independent pathways, because inhibition of one kinase activity had no effect on the other, suggesting that the two pathways act in parallel to regulate the downstream targets necessary for 15-LO expression. Inhibition of PKCδ activation by rottlerin also markedly attenuated IL-13-induced Stat3 DNA binding activity. Our findings indicate that PKCδ plays an important role in regulating IL-13-induced 15-LO expression in human monocytes and subsequently modulates the inflammatory responses mediated by 15-LO products.

Our recent studies demonstrated that p38 MAPK regulates serine 727 phosphorylation on Stat1 and Stat3 and that p38 MAPK activity is required for IL-13-induced 15-LO expression (27Xu B.

PKC is a heterogenous family of serine/threonine kinases mediating important intracellular signaling pathways (28Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 29Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 30Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). PKC isoforms are classified into three major categories, depending on their activation mechanisms as well as Ca2+ and lipid requirements. The conventional PKCs (cPKCs; α, β, and γ) require both Ca2+ and diacylglycerol. The novel PKCs (nPKCs; ϵ, δ, η, and θ) are Ca2+ independent but require diacylglycerol, whereas the atypical PKC isoforms (aPKCs; ι, λ, and ζ) are independent of both Ca2+ and diacylglycerol. Usually, PKCs are activated in response to the engagement of G protein-coupled receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors, and nontyrosine kinase receptors. The activation of PKCδ as evidenced by tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation is induced in response to several stimuli, such as H2O2 (31Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y.

In the present study, we investigated the role of PKC isoforms, particularly PKCδ, in IL-13-induced 15-LO expression in primary human monocytes. We provide evidence that activation of PKCδ by IL-13 is required for the induction of 15-LO in human monocytes and is independent of the p38 MAPK pathway. Reagents—Recombinant human IL-13 was purchased from BIOSOURCE. Antibodies against 15-LO were kindly provided by Dr. Joseph Cornicelli, Parke-Davis. Antibodies to phospho-p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK, phosphoserine 643-PKCδ, and phosphothreonine 505-PKCδ were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to PKCδ, p47phox, and β-tubulin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The general PKC inhibitor calphostin C, the PKCδ-selective inhibitor rottlerin, and the cPKC inhibitor Go 6976 were purchased from Biomol (Butler Pike, PA). The inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO and stored at –20 °C as stock solutions. Isolation of Human Monocytes—Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from whole blood by the separation of mononuclear cells followed by adherence to bovine calf serum (BCS)-coated flasks as described earlier (3Roy B. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32023-32029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Adherent cells were collected from the flask after release with 5 mm EDTA and plated in six-well cell culture plates (Nunclon; Nalge Nunc International, Roskilde, Denmark). The cell preparations were routinely >95% monocytes and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% BCS at 37 °C in the presence of 10% CO2. For some experiments, monocytes were purified from human peripheral blood by Ficoll-Hypaque sedimentation followed by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation (35Wahl L.M. Katona I.M. Wilder R.L.

We observed no differences in results with monocytes obtained by these two protocols. RNA Extraction and Real Time RT-PCR—Monocytes were plated in six-well culture plates at 5 × 106 cells/well in 2 ml of medium. Two hours after plating, cells were treated with 500 pm recombinant IL-13 for 4 h. In some experiments, monocytes were pretreated with inhibitors for 30 min followed by IL-13 treatment for 4 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini-kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), and real time quantitative RT-PCR was performed according to established protocols (27Xu B. Bhattacharjee A. Roy B. Xu H.M. Anthony D. Frank D.A. Feldman G.M. Cathcart M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3918-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Monocytes were plated at 2 × 106/ml in six-well plates, pretreated with the inhibitors (30 min) or antisense ODN whenever required and then treated with IL-13 (500 pm) for different time intervals as indicated. After protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Hercules, CA), lysates (50 μg/well) were loaded on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and blotted with appropriate antibodies. The hybridization signal was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation experiments, the lysates were incubated with anti-PKCδ antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Immune complexes were collected using pre-washed protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer. Immune complexes were released by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer and then subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. In several experiments, immunoblots were stripped and reprobed to assess equal loading. Quantification of all Western blot results was conducted using the software program NIH Image as indicated previously (11Roy B. Bhattacharjee A. Xu B. Ford D. Maizel A.L. Cathcart M.K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of Cells with PKCδ Antisense ODN—Human monocytes were plated (5 × 106/well) as described above in six-well plates. PKCδ antisense or sense ODNs were boiled for 1 min and then cooled on ice before being added to the cells. For PKCδ ODN treatment, human monocytes were treated with equivalent molar concentrations of two different PKCδ antisense or sense ODN sequences to yield final concentrations of 5 or 10 μm for 72 h with one re-feed at 24 h prior to the addition of IL-13. Cells were then lysed or utilized for further experimentation. The PKCδ antisense ODN sequences were 5′-GAAGGCGATGCGCAGGAA-3′ (PKCδ4) and 5′-AGGAACGGCGCCATGGTGGG3-′ (PKCδ5). Complementary PKCδ sense ODN sequences were used as controls. The antisense ODN sequences were selected based on prior literature (37Xu J. Rockow S. Kim S. Xiong W. Li W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8018-8027Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and our recently described protocol for identifying optimal mRNA regions for antisense ODN design (38Bey E.A. Cathcart M.K. J.

PKCδ Kinase Assay—The immune complex PKCδ kinase assay was performed as described previously (19Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 25Uddin S. Sassano A. Deb D.K. Verma A. Majchrzak B. Rahman A. Malik A.B. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5554-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, monocytes treated with different reagents for various time points were lysed in a phosphorylation lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm, MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against PKCδ and collected onto protein A-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed three times with the phosphorylation lysis buffer, twice with kinase assay buffer, and then resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer. Histone H1 (10 μg) was added as a substrate for PKCδ and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min before adding 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μg of phosphatidylserine. The incubation was continued at 30 °C for an additional 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding 5× sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, the reaction mixtures were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The phosphorylated form of histone H1 was detected using a PhosphorImager. The membranes were also subjected to Western blot analysis to assess the amount of PKCδ in the immune complexes. LTB4 Production by Monocytes—Monocytes (1 × 106 cells/ml) were plated in duplicate in 12-well culture plates and either pretreated with 5 μm rottlerin for 30 min or left without rottlerin before IL-13 treatment for 72 h. Cells were then challenged with the Ca2+-ionophore A23187, at a final concentration of 5 μm for 15 min. At the end of the incubation, cell supernatants were collected and assayed for LTB4 using the LTB4 Biotrak enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclear Protein Extraction and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—To assess the role of PKCδ in IL-13-induced Stat3 DNA binding activity, EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts and a specific Stat3 probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Monocytes were pretreated with 5 μm rottlerin for 30 min followed by the addition of IL-13 for another 30 min. Nuclear proteins were extracted, and the EMSA was performed following our previously published protocol (11Roy B. Bhattacharjee A. Xu B. Ford D. Maizel A.L. Cathcart M.K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar, 27Xu B. Bhattacharjee A. Roy B. Xu H.M. Anthony D. Frank D.A. Feldman G.M. Cathcart M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3918-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Role of PKC Isoforms in Regulating IL-13-induced 15-LO Expression—Our previous studies indicated that, in addition to protein tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases are also required in the IL-13 induction of 15-LO expression (27Xu B. Bhattacharjee A. Roy B. Xu H.M. Anthony D. Frank D.A. Feldman G.M. Cathcart M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3918-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). PKCs are a major class of serine/threonine kinases and are involved in regulating the expression of a variety of different genes. We, therefore, assessed the possible involvement of PKC in IL-13-mediated 15-LO expression. Monocytes were treated with calphostin C, a general inhibitor for PKC (40Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), before exposure to IL-13. Calphostin C substantially inhibited IL-13-induced 15-LO protein expression in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1A). In contrast, a cPKC-selective inhibitor, Go 6976, had no effect on the IL-13-mediated 15-LO expression at the doses shown to be specific for inhibiting PKCα and PKCβ activity (41Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that PKC isoform(s) other than cPKCs are required for IL-13-induced 15-LO expression. IL-13 Induces Phosphorylation and Activation of PKCδ in Human Monocytes—We recently reported that IL-13-induced 15-LO gene expression requires p38 MAPK activity (27Xu B. Bhattacharjee A. Roy B. Xu H.M. Anthony D. Frank D.A. Feldman G.M. Cathcart M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3918-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Another study suggests that thrombin-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene expression in endothelial cells involves PKCδ-dependent activation of p38 MAPK (32Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Uddin S. Xu N. Ye R.D. Platanias L.C. Malik A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5554-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKCδ is involved in the regulation of IL-13-induced 15-LO expression, we first examined PKCδ activation following IL-13 treatment utilizing antibodies that specifically recognize phosphoserine at position 643 or phosphothreonine at position 505 of PKCδ. After treatment with IL-13 for different times, the cells were lysed, and the whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCδ antibody followed by immunoblot analysis using the anti-phospho-PKCδ antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2A, IL-13 induced both serine (643) and threonine (505) phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. The phosphorylated forms of PKCδ were detected as early as 5 min, and the peak of phosphorylation was at 10 min after IL-13 treatment, with the signal diminishing afterward. To further determine whether phosphorylation of PKCδ resulted in increased kinase activity, we performed a PKCδ kinase assay in which PKCδ from monocytes was immunoprecipitated using an anti-PKCδ antibody, and the phosphorylation of the substrate histone H1 was assessed. IL-13 treatment for 15 min resulted in a remarkable induction of PKCδ kinase activity as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of its substrate, histone H1 (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the activation of PKCδ in IL-13-treated cells is one of the early signaling events leading to various cellular processes. PKCδ Is Required for IL-13 Signaling Pathways Leading to 15-LO Expression—To investigate the possible role of PKCδ in regulating IL-13-induced 15-LO expression, monocytes were pretreated with rottlerin, a PKCδ-selective inhibitor, or Go 6976 for 30 min and then incubated with IL-13 for an additional 4 h. The quantitative real time RT-PCR experiments showed that the induction of 15-LO mRNA by IL-13 was >60-fold (26) by 4 h, and pretreatment with rottlerin had profound inhibitory effects by reducing the fold-induction to 25 (>60% inhibition compared with that of the IL-13 treated group) (Fig. 3A). The mRNA levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were nearly identical in all the samples, indicating specificity of the response. Rottlerin was also effective in inhibiting IL-13-induced 15-LO protein expression as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). In contrast, Go 6976 had no effect on 15-LO mRNA or protein expression. To further test the functional role of PKCδ in regulating 15-LO gene expression, we treated cells with the PKCδ-specific antisense or control sense ODN before IL-13 addition. Total cellular RNA or proteins were extracted for real time RT-PCR or Western blot analysis, respectively. Our results, presented in Fig. 4, A and B, indicate that PKCδ antisense ODN inhibited both 15-LO mRNA and protein expression by ∼50%, whereas PKCδ sense ODN caused no inhibition of 15-LO expression. These data confirm the results presented in Fig. 3, A and B, where pharmacological inhibitors were employed. Induction of 15-LO Expression Blocks LTB4 Production— Previous studies suggest that LTB4 production in human monocytes is inhibited by IL-4-induced 15-LO expression (10Profita M. Sala A. Siena L. Henson P.M. Murphy R.C. Paterno A. Bonanno A. Riccobono L. Mirabella A. Bonsignore G. Vignola A.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We reproduced this observation with IL-13-induced 15-LO expression and tested whether a blockade of IL-13-induced 15-LO expression by the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin could restore LTB4 production. For these studies, monocytes were either left untreated or treated with 5 μm rottlerin for 30 min, followed by IL-13 for 72 h. Cells were then challenged by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, and LTB4 production in supernatants was determined. As presented in Fig. 5, treatment of monocytes with A23187 induced LTB4 production by >3-fold, and IL-13 pretreatment significantly inhibited the A23187-induced LTB4 production (p = 0.0302). Furthermore, when cells were treated with rottlerin at the dose that almost completely inhibited IL-13-induced 15-LO expression, it blocked the IL-13 inhibitory effects on LTB4 production (p = 0.0215 when compared with IL-13/A23187 group). These data suggest the potential importance and biological function of PKCδ in regulating inflammatory responses via 15-LO expression induced by Th2 cytokines. PKCδ Does Not Regulate p38 MAPK Phosphorylation/Activation—We recently found that, in human monocytes, IL-13 induces p38 MAPK activation, which regulates the Ser-727 phosphorylation of both Stat1 and Stat3 (27Xu B. Bhattacharjee A. Roy B. Xu H.M. Anthony D. Frank D.A. Feldman G.M. Cathcart M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3918-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As mentioned previously, a prior study suggests that PKCδ may be one of the upstream kinases regulating p38 MAPK activation (32Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Uddin S. Xu N. Ye R.D. Platanias L.C. Malik A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5554-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKCδ activity is required for p38 MAPK activation in IL-13-treated monocytes, we treated cells with rottlerin for 30 min before IL-13 stimulation. Total cell lysates were extracted, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation/activation was evaluated. As presented in Fig. 6A, pretreatment with rottlerin at a dose (5 μm) that substantially inhibited PKCδ activation (42Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) and 15-LO expression (Fig. 3) had no detectable effect on IL-13-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. These data suggest that p38 MAPK is not the downstream target of PKCδ in the IL-13-induced signaling pathway in human monocytes. To determine whether p38 MAPK was upstream of PKCδ, we treated cells with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 prior to IL-13 stimulation and evaluated PKCδ phosphorylation. Pretreatment with SB202190 at a dose that significantly inhibited p38 MAPK activity and IL-13-induced 15-LO expression (27Xu B. Bhattacharjee A. Roy B. Xu H.M. Anthony D. Frank D.A. Feldman G.M.

These results indicate that the PKCδ and p38 MAPK regulation of downstream targets are independent from each other and the two kinases act in parallel in regulating IL-13-induced 15-LO expression in human monocytes. PKCδ Is Involved in Stat3 DNA Binding Activity—PKCδ has been shown to regulate the expression of a variety of genes through the activation of various transcription factors (24Schuringa J.J.

In our previous report, we demonstrated a predominant role of Stat3 in IL-13-induced 15-LO expression (27Xu B. Bhattacharjee A. Roy B. Xu H.M. Anthony D. Frank D.A. Feldman G.M. Cathcart M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3918-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKCδ activity is required for Stat3 DNA binding, EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts from IL-13-treated monocytes and a 32P-labeled probe specific for Stat3. As shown in Fig. 7, pretreatment of cells with rottlerin profoundly inhibited the IL-13-induced Stat3 DNA binding activity. These results thus suggest that the activation of PKCδ by IL-13 is required for maximal Stat3 DNA binding activity. Our previous studies indicated that the induction of 15-LO expression by IL-13 requires activation of Jak2 and Tyk2 tyrosine kinases (3Roy B. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32023-32029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and that IL-13 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of selective Stat proteins (11Roy B. Bhattacharjee A. Xu B. Ford D. Maizel A.L. Cathcart M.K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar). We recently reported that IL-13-induced 15-LO expression is also modulated through Ser/Thr kinases, particularly through p38 MAPK regulation of Stat1 and Stat3 Ser 727 phosphorylation (27Xu B. Bhattacharjee A. Roy B. Xu H.M. Anthony D. Frank D.A. Feldman G.M. Cathcart M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3918-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide new insights of co-stimulatory signals for IL-13-induced 15-LO expression and provide evidence that one of the PKC isoforms, PKCδ, is required for 15-LO gene expression and modulates the production of inflammatory mediators. The activation of PKCδ requires the phosphorylation of residues at Thr-505 and Ser-643 (31Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 45Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Although PKCδ can be activated by a variety of agonists, our results demonstrate for the first time that IL-13 is able to induce PKCδ activation in primary human monocytes. The induction of PKCδ activity represents one of the early events in IL-13-initiated signaling pathways, suggesting an important role of PKCδ in IL-13-induced gene expression. We employed multiple approaches to establish the functional role of PKCδ in IL-13-induced 15-LO gene expression. Pretreatment of cells with rottlerin or PKCδ-specific antisense ODN inhibited IL-13-induced 15-LO mRNA and protein expression, whereas Go 6976, which inhibits only cPKCs (19Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) or PKCδ sense ODN were ineffective, suggesting an isoform-specific role in the regulation of the IL-13-mediated signaling pathways. Our current studies also showed that, in human monocytes, IL-13-induced 15-LO expression is accompanied by a significant reduction of LTB4 production upon challenge with A23187, and this inhibitory effect can be reversed by the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin. It has been suggested that the inhibition of LTB4 synthesis by Th2 cytokines is not due to changes in the expression of the key enzymes such as 5-LO nor due to the newly expressed 15-LO competing for common substrates with 5-LO (10Profita M. Sala A. Siena L. Henson P.M. Murphy R.C. Paterno A. Bonanno A. Riccobono L. Mirabella A. Bonsignore G. Vignola A.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Instead, 15-LO products such as 15(S)-HETE may be responsible for the inhibition of LTB4 production. Because 15(S)-HETE and other 15-LO products exert various immunoregulatory functions, our findings regarding the role of PKCδ in IL-13-induced 15-LO expression may prove to be physiologically relevant to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and asthma. The early activation of PKCδ suggests that it may be one of the upstream Ser/Thr kinases providing a co-stimulatory signal for IL-13-induced gene expression. There is increasing evidence supporting the critical role of PKCδ-mediated Stat1 and Stat3 Ser-727 phosphorylation in cytokine-induced gene expression (19Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 24Schuringa J.J. Dekker L.V. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5554-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because IL-13 treatment induces p38 MAPK activation and subsequent Stat1 and Stat3 Ser-727 phosphorylation in human monocytes (27Xu B. Bhattacharjee A. Roy B. Xu H.M. Anthony D. Frank D.A. Feldman G.M. Cathcart M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3918-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we investigated whether p38 MAPK was related to PKCδ in the IL-13-mediated signal transduction pathways. Our results with pharmacological inhibitors reveal that IL-13-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation/activation is neither a downstream event nor an upstream kinase of PKCδ. Hence, these two different pathways leading to phosphorylation of downstream targets are independent, parallel pathways, but both are indispensable for IL-13-induced 15-LO expression. The finding that two distinct Ser/Thr kinases regulate Stat3 DNA binding activity is novel and intriguing (27Xu B. Bhattacharjee A. Roy B. Xu H.M. Anthony D. Frank D.A. Feldman G.M. Cathcart M.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3918-3928Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We propose that, although neither of PKCδ or p38 MAPK regulates the phosphorylation/activation of the other, they may be present in a signaling complex that is required for and controls the important phosphorylation events of their downstream targets like Stat3. Current studies in the laboratory are focused on delineating the details of this unique process. In summary, our current study indicates that activation of PKCδ by IL-13 plays an important role in IL-13-induced 15-LO expression in human monocytes. Although PKCδ-mediated 15-LO expression is independent of p38 MAPK, the two Ser/Thr kinases may provide co-stimulatory signals to downstream targets regulating 15-LO expression and subsequently modulate the inflammatory responses mediated by 15-LO products.

https://openalex.org/W2054176719,"Interleukin-3 (IL-3) expression by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and its effects on vessel assembly were evaluated. TILs from 'in situ' human breast cancers expressed CD4/CD25 antigens and IL-3. An injection of Matrigel containing SMC and IL-3 or basic-fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) into SCID mice confirmed the neoangiogenetic effect of both factors. However, in response to IL-3, but not to bFGF, only few SMC became incorporated into the nascent vessels. To evaluate the possibility that signals emanated by the nascent vasculature in the presence of IL-3 may negatively regulate SMC recruitment, conditioned media (CM) from IL-3-treated endothelial cells (EC) or SMC were tested for their biological effects on SMC and EC. CM from IL-3-treated SMC stimulated the migration of EC. In contrast, the migration of SMC was not affected by CM from IL-3-stimulated EC; however, it was greatly enhanced by blocking transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) activity. TGF beta immunoenzymatic assay demonstrated the following: (i) the absence of TGF beta activity in CM from IL-3-stimulated EC; (ii) a barely detectable TGF beta activity in CM from IL-3-stimulated SMC; and (iii) the presence of TGF beta activity in the supernatants of SMC stimulated with CM from IL-3-, but not from bFGF-stimulated EC. Increased TGF beta mRNA expression was only detected in SMC stimulated with CM from IL-3-treated EC. Finally, the inhibitory signals induced by IL-3 in vivo were abrogated by the addition of the neutralizing TGF beta antibody. Thus, the positive immunostaining for IL-3 by TILs in 'in situ' breast cancers sustains the possibility that early in tumor development, IL-3 can contribute to the chronic immaturity of these vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2005197134,"Genotoxic carcinogens exert their tumorigenic effects in part by inducing genomic instability. We recently showed that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 12 associates significantly with the induction of chromosome instability (CIN) by the likely human lung carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and vinyl carbamate (VC) during mouse lung carcinogenesis. Here, we demonstrate the carcinogen specificity of this event and its effect on lung tumor evolution. LOH on chromosome 12 was observed in 45% of NNK-induced, 59% of VC-induced, 58% of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced, 14% of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced and 12% of spontaneous lung adenocarcinomas. The frequency of LOH in each of the carcinogen-induced groups, except ENU, was significantly higher than in the spontaneous group (P<0.001). Deletion mapping revealed four potential candidate regions of 1-4 centiMorgans suspected to contain targeted tumor suppressor genes, with at least one expected to have a role in CIN. The relationship between LOH on chromosome 12 and additional chromosomal alterations occurring during lung tumor progression was also examined. LOH on chromosomes 1 and 14 were moderately frequent during malignant progression in tumors from all treatment groups, occurring in 21-35 and 18-33% of tumors. However, these alterations showed significant concurrence with LOH on chromosome 12 in VC-, NNK- and AFB1-induced tumors (P<0.05). The results suggest that a carcinogen-selective mechanism of lung cancer induction involves the frequent inactivation of genes on chromosome 12, including a stability gene that evidently promotes the evolutionary selection of additional chromosomal alterations during malignant progression."

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the binding, we have employed charged-to-alanine scanning mutagenesis of the soluble fragment containing the N-terminal 287 amino acids of GPIbα. Sixty-two charged amino acids were changed singly or in small clusters, and 38 mutant constructs were expressed in the supernatant of 293T cells. Each mutant was assayed for binding to several monoclonal antibodies for human GPIbα and for ristocetin-induced and botrocetin-induced binding of 125I-labeled human VWF. Mutations at Glu128, Glu172, and Asp175 specifically decreased both ristocetin- and botrocetin-induced VWF binding, suggesting that these sites are important for VWF binding of platelet GPIb. Monoclonal antibody 6D1 inhibited ristocetin- and botrocetin-induced VWF binding, and a mutation at Glu125 specifically reduced the binding to 6D1.

The VWF binding domain of human GPIbα consists of the N-terminal flank region, domains of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), the C-terminal flank region, the anionic sulfated tyrosine region, and the macroglycopeptide region (4Clemetson K.J.

Plasmid Construct—The full-length cDNA for human GPIbα was kindly provided by Dr. Gerald J. Roth (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The EcoRI fragment containing the signal sequences and the full coding sequence of human GPIbα was cloned into pBluescriptII/KS(+), and the 1-kb EcoRI/XbaI fragment containing amino acid residues 1–318 of GPIbα was constructed (pBS/hGPIb/EX). To this template, a primer pair was designed: G652, CCAAAGGGCTTTTTTGGGTC (652–671 of human GPIbα cDNA (16Lopez J.A. Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Hagen F.S. Papayannopoulou T. Roth G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The amplified fragment was digested by PstI and XbaI, and the resulting 280-bp fragment was inserted into PstI- and XbaI-digested pBS/hGPIb/EX. Thus, in the resulting plasmid pBS/hGPIbFLAG, the corresponding amino acid residues 303–318 were replaced by FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK) followed by the stop codon TGA. Plasmid pBS/hGPIbFLAG was used as a template for further alanine scanning mutagenesis by using a PCR-based method as described earlier (17Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBS/hGPIbFLAG has unique HindIII, BsmBI, PstI, and NotI sites that enable mutagenesis of 287 amino acids by a cassette replacement method. Thirty-eight mutated GPIb fragments were produced and cloned into pBS/hGPIbFLAG by using two of these four enzymes. By the automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems 310, Foster City, CA), DNA sequence analysis was performed for ∼150–200 bp of the amplified fragments between each enzyme site. Then, the HindIII/NotI fragment was cloned into pcDNAI/neo (Invitrogen), and the expression plasmid pcPNAI/hGPIbFLAG was produced. It contained the N-terminal fragment between Met16 and Ala302 of human GPIbα and would be expressed as a soluble fragment containing a FLAG tag at the C-terminal end. Expression and Characterization of Recombinant GPIbα Chain— Human 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with pcDNAI/hGPIbFLAG containing either wild type or mutant GPIbα by using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's recommendation. In mock transfection, pcDNAI/neo was used. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated with the serum-free medium (Optimem-1, Invitrogen). After 48 h, recombinant GPIbα (rGPIbα) secreted in the medium was concentrated using Centriprep-30 and Centricon-100 devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The concentration of each mutant was determined by the two-step ELISA. For the first ELISA, diluted MAb 6D1 (7.5 μg/ml) in bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) was coated onto microtiter plates with U-shape bottoms (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed five times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and then incubated for 120 min at room temperature with 15 μl of rGPIbα diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The wells were washed again and incubated with diluted MWCL-1 for 90 min at room temperature. Washed wells were then incubated with diluted peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) followed by the color development of the absorbance at 490 nm. GPIbα-CaM (7Li C.Q.

After the first ELISA, the cell supernatant was concentrated, and PBS containing 0.5% BSA was used to dilute to 10 mg/ml. The sample was subjected to the second ELISA using anti-FLAG M2 MAb as the capturing antibody, and then the amount of each mutant was arbitrarily determined by comparing with wild type rGPIbα with known concentrations. The two ELISAs were performed in four distinct experiments. Mutants were aliquoted for the following ristocetin-induced or botrocetin-induced binding assays, and each aliquot was used for one experiment. In the VWF binding assays, an aliquot was also subjected to the simultaneous ELISA (same as the second ELISA). This additional ELISA was performed in duplicate. In the first ELISA, several mutants showed remarkably low absorbance, suggesting that they decreased 6D1 binding specifically or nonspecifically. For these mutants, the second ELISA was performed alternatively twice by using wild type rGPIbα with known concentrations as a standard. Western Blotting Analysis of Wild Type Recombinant GPIb—Approximately 25–30 ng of wild type rGPIbα was diluted 2-fold with gel-loading buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% acrylamide gels under non-reduced and reduced conditions. After transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), proteins were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 MAb or various anti-GPIb MAbs (6D1, HPL7, AN51, and SZ2) and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Blots were developed by using ECL-Western blotting detection systems. 125I Labeling of VWF—Purified human VWF (1 mg) and 1 mCi of Na125I were added to a vial containing 5 Iodobeads. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min with gentle agitation, and then 1 mm NaI buffer was added. Labeled proteins were separated from free Na125I on Centriprep-10 (Millipore). VWF antigen levels in the reaction mixture were determined by VWF-specific ELISA as described previously (18Tuley E.A. Gaucher C. Jorieux S. Worrall N.K. Sadler J.E. Mazurier C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6377-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). VWF Binding Assay—Polystyrene microplate wells with round bottom (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated with 50 μl of anti-FLAG M2 MAb (10 μg/ml in 50 mm bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) at 4 °C for 24 h. The plates were washed three times with 150 μl of PBST, pH 7.4, and then blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA (PBSA) at 4 °C for 48 h. After blocking, all incubations were performed at room temperature. For ristocetin-induced VWF binding to rGPIbα, varying concentrations of 125I-VWF and rGPIbα were incubated with PBSA and 2 mg/ml (final) ristocetin in a total volume of 25 μl for 1 h. Ristocetin causes nonspecific agglutination of VWF (19Scott A.P. Montgomery R.R. Retzinger G.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The mixture was transferred to anti-FLAG M2 MAb-coated plates, incubated, and washed six times with PBST. Bound VWF was solubilized by adding 2% SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol, and the radioactivity was quantitated by a γ-scintillation counter. For botrocetin-induced VWF binding, varying concentrations of VWF and rGPIbα were incubated with PBS, 10 μg/ml botrocetin (10 μg/ml, final), and 0.3% BSA (final) in a total volume of 50 μl for 30 min. Forty μl of the solution was transferred to anti-FLAG M2 MAb-coated plate wells and incubated; the solution was then washed, followed by measurement by the γ-scintillation counter as in the ristocetin-induced binding assay. Negative control assays were performed by using concentrated conditioned media from mock-transfected 293T cells. For both assays, nonspecific binding was determined by subtracting the total radioactivity from that of mock control. Inhibition of VWF Binding to GPIb by Anti-GPIb MAb—To analyze MAb inhibition for the ristocetin-induced VWF binding of wild type rGPIbα, 4 μg/ml VWF, 0.7 μg/ml wild type rGPIbα, and 10 μg/ml each anti-GPIb antibody were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 2 mg/ml ristocetin and 3% BSA in a total volume of 25 μl at room temperature. For botrocetin-induced binding, 1.25 μg/ml VWF, 0.7 μg/ml wild type rGPIbα, and 10 μg/ml each antibody were incubated for 1 h with 10 μg/ml botrocetin and 0.3% BSA in a total volume of 25 μl at room temperature. For both assays, rGPIbα in the mixture was captured on anti-FLAG M2 MAb-coated plates, and the bound radioactivity was quantitated as described above. The specific inhibition ratio of each antibody was normalized to corresponding values obtained without the antibodies. The MAb inhibition assay for the ristocetin- or botrocetin-induced platelet GPIb binding of VWF was performed as for recombinant VWF platelet binding assay as described previously (17Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), except that 10 μg/ml each anti-GPIb antibody was added. Bound VWF was calculated subtracting percent unbound VWF from 100%, and the percent inhibition was expressed by normalizing to the values obtained without antibodies (17Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mutant rGPIbα Binding to Anti-GPIb MAbs—Polystyrene microplate wells with U-shape bottoms (Coster, Cambridge, MA) were coated with 30 μl of various anti-GPIb MAbs (6D1, AN51, SZ2, and HPL7) at 4 °C for 24 h. Antibodies were diluted at 10 μg/ml in 50 mm bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Plates were washed three times with PBST. Because each antibody appeared to have a different dissociation constant for GPIb, the appropriate rGPIbα doses applied on the wells should vary, and appropriate concentrations were determined before the comparison of mutants. Several different concentrations of wild type rGPIbα were tested, and the specific range was set to give linear concentration-dependent signals for each antibody (data not shown). As a result, for 6D1 and HPL7, 5 ng/ml rGPIbα was applied on the wells. For AN51 and anti-FLAG M2 MAb, 500 ng/ml rGPIbα was used. For SZ2, 150 ng/ml rGPIbα was applied on the wells. Given concentrations of wild type or mutant rGPIbα were incubated in a total volume of 20 μl at 4 °C for 24 h. The wells were washed, incubated with diluted MWCL-1, washed, and then incubated with diluted peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG followed by the color development of the absorbance at 490 nm. At least two independent duplicate assays were performed, and the percent binding was calculated by normalizing to the value obtained for wild type rGPIbα. Negative control assays were performed by using concentrated conditioned media from mock-transfected 293T cells. Crystallographic Structure Representations—The PDB file of the structural coordinate was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (www.pdb.org). The coordinate of isolated human GPIbα (1GWB) (20Uff S. Clemetson J.M. Harrison T. Clemetson K.J. Emsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35657-35663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Jonas Emsley. 3J. Emsley, personal communication. Protein ribbon representation of the complex of GPIbα was prepared with the program PyMol (www.pymol.org). Design and Expression of rGPIbα Mutants—A functional domain that retains VWF binding activity resides in the N-terminal 45-kDa fragment between residues His1 and Arg293 of GPIbα (21Titani K. Takio K. Handa M. Ruggeri Z.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Vicente V. Kostel P.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18473-18479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The segment that was targeted in this study consists of 287 amino acid residues between His1 and Asp287 of human GPIbα (16Lopez J.A. Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Hagen F.S. Papayannopoulou T. Roth G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5615-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This segment contains several regions including the N-terminal flank, LRRs, the C-terminal flank region, the anionic sulfated tyrosine region, and a part of the macroglycopeptide region (Fig. 1) (4Clemetson K.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Lopez J.A. Andrews R.K. Afshar-Kharghan V. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 4397-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To simplify the production and analysis of mutant constructs, a clustered charged-to-alanine scanning strategy was chosen. Charged amino acids usually are at or near the protein surface, and alanine was selected as the replacement residue because it is the most common amino acid in proteins, is compatible with all types of secondary structures, and does not impose new structural effects related to hydrogen bonding, unusual hydrophobicity, or steric bulk (24Wells J.A. Langone J.J. Methods in Enzymology. 202. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 390-411Google Scholar). The recombinant GPIbα fragment 1–302 contained 62 charged residues, including arginine, lysine, aspartate, glutamate, and histidine, and was changed singly or in small clusters to alanine. The 62 charged residues in the targeted region were covered in a total of 38 constructs of rGPIbα, including 19 clustered mutants and 19 single mutants (Fig. 1). For convenience the mutants were named according to the residue number of the mutated amino acids in the mature GPIbα. If more than one charged amino acid was mutated, the range of residue numbers and the number of alanine substitutions are indicated. For example, in construct E128A, one glutamate at position 128 was changed to alanine; in construct (172–175)2A, the two residues Glu172 and Asp175 were changed to alanine (Fig. 1). Mutants were expressed in human kidney 293T cells and secreted as soluble proteins with FLAG tag at the C-terminal end. Cells were transfected with each construct, and serum-free media were analyzed for the expression of mutant rGPIbα. Because a construct containing the single mutation D106A was not secreted, D106K, where negatively charged Asp was changed to positively charged Lys, was constructed and analyzed. All other mutant proteins were expressed and secreted efficiently (data not shown). Western Blotting Analysis of Wild Type Recombinant GPIbα— The present study employed four MAbs, 6D1 (25Karpatkin S. Pearlstein E. Ambrogio C. Coller B.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 81: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), HPL7, AN51 (26Afshar-Kharghan V. Gineys G. Schade A.J. Sun L. Li C.Q. McIntire L.V. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3384-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and SZ2 (27Ward C.M. Andrews R.K. Smith A.I. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), directed against human GPIb. We performed Western blotting analysis of wild type rGPIbα by using the four MAbs (Fig. 2). The binding of anti-FLAG M2 antibody was studied simultaneously, and it bound both reduced and non-reduced forms of wild type rGPIbα with ∼45-kDa molecular masses (Fig. 2). Under non-reduced condition, all anti-GPIb antibodies reacted with wild type rGPIbα, and ∼45-kDa bands were visible (Fig. 2A). When proteins were reduced, 6D1, HPL7, and AN51 lost the binding, whereas SZ2 bound normally (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the binding of the antibodies 6D1, AN51, and HPL7 was sensitive to reduction, suggesting that these antibodies are protein conformation-dependent. The binding of SZ2 was not sensitive to protein reduction. Effect on VWF Binding by Monoclonal Antibodies for GPIb— The four MAbs, 6D1, HPL7, AN51, and SZ2, were tested for their ability to inhibit the ristocetin- or botrocetin-induced binding by 125I-VWF to rGPIbα (Fig. 3A). We also tested the inhibition for plasma VWF binding to fixed human platelets (Fig. 3B). MAb 6D1 completely inhibited both rGPIbα-VWF and platelet-VWF interaction in the presence of ristocetin or botrocetin (Fig. 3, A and B). SZ2 inhibited botrocetin-induced rGPIbα-VWF interaction by 30% and botrocetin-induced platelet-VWF interaction by 60% (Fig. 3, A and B). AN51 and HPL7 had no effects on VWF binding induced by either ristocetin or botrocetin (Fig. 3). Binding of Monoclonal Antibodies to Mutant rGPIbα—Mutant binding to each MAb was measurable by a specific ELISA. The MAb epitope might be related to the important amino acid residues for binding to VWF, and we analyzed the binding of the mutants to a panel of the four MAbs (Fig. 4). For each antibody, the relative absorbance value was expressed as the percentage for wild type GPIbα (Fig. 4). Mutants D83A, H86A, D106K, and (149–152)3A constitutively decreased binding to MAbs 6D1, HPL7, and AN51, whereas these mutants normally bound to SZ2. From the Western blotting analysis, the binding of 6D1, AN51, and HPL7 for wild type rGPIbα was lost by reduction, whereas SZ2 binding was not affected (Fig. 2), suggesting that the binding of the former three MAbs is dependent on protein conformation. Therefore, it is suggested that Asp83, His86, Asp106, Lys149, Glu151, and Lys152 are included in amino acids that are important for protein conformation of GPIbα. In contrast, MAb 6D1 specifically reduced the binding to mutant E125A by 6.3% of wild type rGPIbα, and MAb HPL7 showed 9.7% binding to a mutant R121A (Fig. 4). These mutants showed normal binding to other antibodies. It is thus suggested that the epitope of 6D1 and HPL7 is included in Glu125 and Arg121, respectively. SZ2 showed decreased binding to (274–277)2A (13.2%) and to (281–283)3A (14.8%) (Fig. 4), suggesting that the binding of SZ2 is dependent on the C-terminal side of the rGPIbα fragment between Asp274 and Asp283 and that the epitope is included in residues Asp274, Asp277, Glu281, Glu282, and Asp283. This result is consistent with the study on human-canine chimera proteins by Shen et al. (28Shen Y. Romo G.M. Dong J.F. Schade A. McIntire L.V. Kenny D. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. Lopez J.A. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2000; 95: 903-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that mapped the epitope of SZ2 into the anionic sulfated tyrosine region. Fig. 4 does not clearly demonstrate epitopes of MAb AN51. Binding of rGPIbα to VWF—Thirty-eight mutants were tested for the VWF binding induced by ristocetin or botrocetin. To determine the assay condition, we first evaluated the specific 125I-labeled VWF binding of varying doses of immobilized rGPIbα. For ristocetin-induced binding, wild type rGPIbα was tested in the presence of 2 mg/ml ristocetin. Wild type rGPIbα (1.4 μg/ml) immobilized on anti-FLAG M2 MAb-coated plates appeared to give half-maximum binding of VWF (Fig. 5A). Thus, varying VWF concentrations were tested for immobilized wild type rGPIbα (1.4 μg/ml), and 50 μg/ml 125I-VWF gave half-maximum binding (Fig. 5B). Based on these control experiments, the binding of 50 μg/ml 125I-VWF to 1.4 μg/ml each mutant GPIbα was tested and compared. The botrocetin-induced VWF binding assay was tested in the presence of 10 μg/ml botrocetin. Wild type rGPIbα (0.7 μg/ml) immobilized on anti-FLAG M2 MAb-coated plates appeared to give optimum binding of VWF (Fig. 5C). Varying VWF concentrations were tested for 0.7 μg/ml wild type rGPIbα, and 1.25 μg/ml 125I-VWF gave the optimum binding (Fig. 5D). This condition was used for comparison of the mutants. To summarize binding data in graphical form, values obtained for each rGPIbα mutant were normalized to the corresponding values obtained for wild type rGPIbα in the presenc"

https://openalex.org/W2088611581,"The pre-T-cell receptor (TCR) delivers essential survival/differentiation signals to the developing thymocytes. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) and recombination-activating gene (RAG)-deficient mice are unable to assemble antigen receptor genes, and therefore cannot express a pre-TCR. Consequently, T lymphocyte differentiation is arrested at an early stage in the thymus of these animals, and immature thymocytes are eliminated through apoptotic processes. This maturation arrest can be relieved and thymocyte differentiation rescued after the exposure of these mice to whole-body gamma-irradiation. Whereas the promotion of immature thymocyte survival/differentiation was shown to require p53 activity in irradiated SCID mice, it was suggested, on the other hand, that p53 activation prevents immature thymocytes survival/differentiation in irradiated RAG-deficient mice. However, SCID mice have impaired responses to ionizing radiation. In this paper, we analysed p53 requirement in radiation-induced thymocyte differentiation in CD3epsilon(Delta5/Delta5) mice, where pre-TCR deficiency also results in an early block of lymphocyte development. Our results show at the cellular and molecular levels that, in this DNA repair-proficient model, irradiation-induced thymocyte differentiation proceeds either by a p53-dependent or by a p53-independent pathway, which differ in their sensitivity to the radiation dose delivered."
https://openalex.org/W1985161670,"Unlike all other countries in the world, the United States awards patents to the first to invent, not to the first to file an application for a patent. In cases where two or more inventors submit patent applications claiming the same invention, an interference may be declared. Interference is the process by which the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO; Washington, DC, USA) determines which of the applicants was the first to invent and diligently reduce the invention to practice. More than half of these are resolved in favor of the inventor who was the first-to-file, raising questions about whether this unique system is worth retaining. Interferences are relatively rare. For the period 1998-2002, an average of four interferences were declared for every 10,000 patent applications filed. Data we have gathered suggest that interference proceedings in gene discovery and biotechnology are much more prevalent than other areas of technology. The resulting legal fees are costing the biotechnology industry millions of dollars each year. Comments Postprint version.
