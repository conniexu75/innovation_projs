https://openalex.org/W2760946358,"Visual inspection of histopathology slides is one of the main methods used by pathologists to assess the stage, type and subtype of lung tumors. Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are the most prevalent subtypes of lung cancer, and their distinction requires visual inspection by an experienced pathologist. In this study, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (inception v3) on whole-slide images obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas to accurately and automatically classify them into LUAD, LUSC or normal lung tissue. The performance of our method is comparable to that of pathologists, with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97. Our model was validated on independent datasets of frozen tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and biopsies. Furthermore, we trained the network to predict the ten most commonly mutated genes in LUAD. We found that six of them-STK11, EGFR, FAT1, SETBP1, KRAS and TP53-can be predicted from pathology images, with AUCs from 0.733 to 0.856 as measured on a held-out population. These findings suggest that deep-learning models can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype or gene mutations. Our approach can be applied to any cancer type, and the code is available at https://github.com/ncoudray/DeepPATH ."
https://openalex.org/W2892318814,"Neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, are characterized by invasion of the brain by autoreactive T cells. The mechanism for how T cells acquire their encephalitogenic phenotype and trigger disease remains, however, unclear. The existence of lymphatic vessels in the meninges indicates a relevant link between the CNS and peripheral immune system, perhaps affecting autoimmunity. Here we demonstrate that meningeal lymphatics fulfill two critical criteria: they assist in the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid components and enable immune cells to enter draining lymph nodes in a CCR7-dependent manner. Unlike other tissues, meningeal lymphatic endothelial cells do not undergo expansion during inflammation, and they express a unique transcriptional signature. Notably, the ablation of meningeal lymphatics diminishes pathology and reduces the inflammatory response of brain-reactive T cells during an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Our findings demonstrate that meningeal lymphatics govern inflammatory processes and immune surveillance of the CNS and pose a valuable target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2891731267,"Unlike most tumor suppressor genes, the most common genetic alterations in tumor protein p53 (TP53) are missense mutations1,2. Mutant p53 protein is often abundantly expressed in cancers and specific allelic variants exhibit dominant-negative or gain-of-function activities in experimental models3-8. To gain a systematic view of p53 function, we interrogated loss-of-function screens conducted in hundreds of human cancer cell lines and performed TP53 saturation mutagenesis screens in an isogenic pair of TP53 wild-type and null cell lines. We found that loss or dominant-negative inhibition of wild-type p53 function reliably enhanced cellular fitness. By integrating these data with the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) mutational signatures database9,10, we developed a statistical model that describes the TP53 mutational spectrum as a function of the baseline probability of acquiring each mutation and the fitness advantage conferred by attenuation of p53 activity. Collectively, these observations show that widely-acting and tissue-specific mutational processes combine with phenotypic selection to dictate the frequencies of recurrent TP53 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2890361765,"Cancer cells rely on dysregulated gene expression. This establishes specific transcriptional addictions that may be therapeutically exploited. Yet, the mechanisms that are ultimately responsible for these addictions are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the transcriptional dependencies of transformed cells to the transcription factors YAP and TAZ. YAP/TAZ physically engage the general coactivator bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), dictating the genome-wide association of BRD4 to chromatin. YAP/TAZ flag a large set of enhancers with super-enhancer-like functional properties. YAP/TAZ-bound enhancers mediate the recruitment of BRD4 and RNA polymerase II at YAP/TAZ-regulated promoters, boosting the expression of a host of growth-regulating genes. Treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of BRD4 blunts YAP/TAZ pro-tumorigenic activity in several cell or tissue contexts, causes the regression of pre-established, YAP/TAZ-addicted neoplastic lesions and reverts drug resistance. This work sheds light on essential mediators, mechanisms and genome-wide regulatory elements that are responsible for transcriptional addiction in cancer and lays the groundwork for a rational use of BET inhibitors according to YAP/TAZ biology. Interdependence between YAP/TAZ and BRD4 drives transcriptional addiction in cancer cells and determines sensitivity to BET inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2889632501,"Eukaryotic cells traffic proteins and lipids between different compartments using protein-coated vesicles and tubules. The retromer complex is required to generate cargo-selective tubulovesicular carriers from endosomal membranes1–3. Conserved in eukaryotes, retromer controls the cellular localization and homeostasis of hundreds of transmembrane proteins, and its disruption is associated with major neurodegenerative disorders4–7. How retromer is assembled and how it is recruited to form coated tubules is not known. Here we describe the structure of the retromer complex (Vps26–Vps29–Vps35) assembled on membrane tubules with the bin/amphiphysin/rvs-domain-containing sorting nexin protein Vps5, using cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging. This reveals a membrane-associated Vps5 array, from which arches of retromer extend away from the membrane surface. Vps35 forms the ‘legs’ of these arches, and Vps29 resides at the apex where it is free to interact with regulatory factors. The bases of the arches connect to each other and to Vps5 through Vps26, and the presence of the same arches on coated tubules within cells confirms their functional importance. Vps5 binds to Vps26 at a position analogous to the previously described cargo- and Snx3-binding site, which suggests the existence of distinct retromer-sorting nexin assemblies. The structure provides insight into the architecture of the coat and its mechanism of assembly, and suggests that retromer promotes tubule formation by directing the distribution of sorting nexin proteins on the membrane surface while providing a scaffold for regulatory-protein interactions. The retromer complex (the vacuolar protein sorting heterotrimer Vps26–Vps29–Vps35) has been resolved in association with membranes and the sorting nexin protein Vps5 using cryo-electron tomography."

https://openalex.org/W2949410668,"The prevailing model of cerebellar learning states that climbing fibers (CFs) are both driven by, and serve to correct, erroneous motor output. However, this model is grounded largely in studies of behaviors that utilize hardwired neural pathways to link sensory input to motor output. To test whether this model applies to more flexible learning regimes that require arbitrary sensorimotor associations, we developed a cerebellar-dependent motor learning task that is compatible with both mesoscale and single-dendrite-resolution calcium imaging in mice. We found that CFs were preferentially driven by and more time-locked to correctly executed movements and other task parameters that predict reward outcome, exhibiting widespread correlated activity in parasagittal processing zones that was governed by these predictions. Together, our data suggest that such CF activity patterns are well-suited to drive learning by providing predictive instructional input that is consistent with an unsigned reinforcement learning signal but does not rely exclusively on motor errors."
https://openalex.org/W2891808384,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to exert therapeutic effects on immunoregulation, tissue repair, and regeneration from the bench to the bedside. Increasing evidence demonstrates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from MSCs could contribute to these effects and are considered as a potential replacement for stem cell-based therapies. However, the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of EV-based treatment in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that human umbilical cord MSC-EVs (huc-MSC-EVs) could protect against IRI-induced hepatic apoptosis by reducing the infiltration of neutrophils and alleviating oxidative stress in hepatic tissue in vivo. Meanwhile, huc-MSC-EVs reduced the respiratory burst of neutrophils and prevented hepatocytes from oxidative stress-induced cell death in vitro. Interestingly, we found that the mitochondria-located antioxidant enzyme, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), was encapsulated in huc-MSC-EVs and reduced oxidative stress in the hepatic IRI model. Knockdown of MnSOD in huc-MSCs decreased the level of MnSOD in huc-MSC-EVs and attenuated the antiapoptotic and antioxidant capacities of huc-MSC-EVs, which could be partially rescued by MnSOD mimetic manganese (III) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP). In summary, these findings provide new clues to reveal the therapeutic effects of huc-MSC-EVs on hepatic IRI and evaluate their preclinical application.—Yao, J., Zheng, J., Cai, J., Zeng, K., Zhou, C., Zhang, J., Li, S., Li, H., Chen, L., He, L., Chen, H., Fu, H., Zhang, Q., Chen, G., Yang, Y., Zhang, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2892147384,"For many of our senses, the role of the cerebral cortex in detecting stimuli is controversial1–17. Here we examine the effects of both acute and chronic inactivation of the primary somatosensory cortex in mice trained to move their large facial whiskers to detect an object by touch and respond with a lever to obtain a water reward. Using transgenic mice, we expressed inhibitory opsins in excitatory cortical neurons. Transient optogenetic inactivation of the primary somatosensory cortex, as well as permanent lesions, initially produced both movement and sensory deficits that impaired detection behaviour, demonstrating the link between sensory and motor systems during active sensing. Unexpectedly, lesioned mice had recovered full behavioural capabilities by the subsequent session. This rapid recovery was experience-dependent, and early re-exposure to the task after lesioning facilitated recovery. Furthermore, ablation of the primary somatosensory cortex before learning did not affect task acquisition. This combined optogenetic and lesion approach suggests that manipulations of the sensory cortex may be only temporarily disruptive to other brain structures that are themselves capable of coordinating multiple, arbitrary movements with sensation. Thus, the somatosensory cortex may be dispensable for active detection of objects in the environment. Mice can learn to detect objects with their whiskers and respond appropriately even in the absence of their primary somatosensory cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2890216231,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a network of membranous sheets and pipes, supports functions encompassing biogenesis of secretory proteins and delivery of functional solutes throughout the cell1,2. Molecular mobility through the ER network enables these functionalities, but diffusion alone is not sufficient to explain luminal transport across supramicrometre distances. Understanding the ER structure–function relationship is critical in light of mutations in ER morphology-regulating proteins that give rise to neurodegenerative disorders3,4. Here, super-resolution microscopy and analysis of single particle trajectories of ER luminal proteins revealed that the topological organization of the ER correlates with distinct trafficking modes of its luminal content: with a dominant diffusive component in tubular junctions and a fast flow component in tubules. Particle trajectory orientations resolved over time revealed an alternating current of the ER contents, while fast ER super-resolution identified energy-dependent tubule contraction events at specific points as a plausible mechanism for generating active ER luminal flow. The discovery of active flow in the ER has implications for timely ER content distribution throughout the cell, particularly important for cells with extensive ER-containing projections such as neurons. Using super-resolution microscopy, tracking of single particle trajectories of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal proteins traversing tubular ER, and measuring ER dynamics, Holcman et al. show that ER content is propelled by active luminal flow."

Here we show a tailored program of noncoding genome elements active in situ in physiologically distinct dopamine neurons of the human brain. We found 71,022 transcribed noncoding elements, many of which were consistent with active enhancers and with regulatory mechanisms in zebrafish and mouse brains. Genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, addiction, and Parkinson's disease were enriched in these elements. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that Parkinson's disease-associated variants on chromosome 17q21 cis-regulate the expression of an enhancer RNA in dopamine neurons. This study shows that enhancers in dopamine neurons link genetic variation to neuropsychiatric traits."
https://openalex.org/W2890416202,"Actions are guided by a Bayesian-like interaction between priors based on experience and current sensory evidence. Here we unveil a complete neural implementation of Bayesian-like behavior, including adaptation of a prior. We recorded the spiking of single neurons in the smooth eye-movement region of the frontal eye fields (FEFSEM), a region that is causally involved in smooth-pursuit eye movements. Monkeys tracked moving targets in contexts that set different priors for target speed. Before the onset of target motion, preparatory activity encodes and adapts in parallel with the behavioral adaptation of the prior. During the initiation of pursuit, FEFSEM output encodes a maximum a posteriori estimate of target speed based on a reliability-weighted combination of the prior and sensory evidence. FEFSEM responses during pursuit are sufficient both to adapt a prior that may be stored in FEFSEM and, through known downstream pathways, to cause Bayesian-like behavior in pursuit. Behavior is the result of a Bayesian computation that weights past experience and current sensory information by their reliabilities. Here single-neuron activity in eye movement cortex exemplifies how the brain implements a Bayesian computation."
https://openalex.org/W2889980427,"T cell receptor cross-reactivity allows a fixed T cell repertoire to respond to a much larger universe of potential antigens. Recent work has emphasized the importance of peptide structural and chemical homology, as opposed to sequence similarity, in T cell receptor cross-reactivity. Surprisingly, though, T cell receptors can also cross-react between ligands with little physiochemical commonalities. Studying the clinically relevant receptor DMF5, we demonstrate that cross-recognition of such divergent antigens can occur through mechanisms that involve heretofore unanticipated rearrangements in the peptide and presenting MHC protein, including binding-induced peptide register shifts and extensions from MHC peptide binding grooves. Moreover, cross-reactivity can proceed even when such dramatic rearrangements do not translate into structural or chemical molecular mimicry. Beyond demonstrating new principles of T cell receptor cross-reactivity, our results have implications for efforts to predict and control T cell specificity and cross-reactivity and highlight challenges associated with predicting T cell reactivities. Structural analysis shows that cross-reactivity of the T cell receptor DMF5 is governed by adaptability of the peptide antigen, which can undergo TCR-binding-induced frameshifting forcing the peptide C terminus to extend from the MHC-binding groove."
https://openalex.org/W2891763083,"Objective Nursing home (NH) stay is the highest level of formal care. With the expected demographic changes ahead, the need for NH placement will put an increasing socioeconomic strain on the society. Survival in NHs and factors predicting survival are important knowledge in order to evaluate NH admission policies and plan future NH capacity. Methods We followed 690 NH residents included at admission to NH over a period of three years. Participants were examined at baseline (BL) and every six months. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including comorbidity, severity of cognitive impairment, dependency in activities of daily living (ADL) and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Median survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis, and factors associated with mortality were identified by Cox models with baseline and time-dependent covariates. Results Median survival in NH was 2.2 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9–2.4). Yearly mortality rate throughout the three-year observation period was 31.8%. Mortality was associated with higher age and comorbidity at BL, and more severe dementia, higher ADL-dependency, less severe psychotic symptoms, and a lower BMI throughout the study period. Of the organizational variables, living on a ward with more residents resulted in a higher risk of mortality. Conclusion In conclusion, the NH mortality rate remained stable throughout the three-year study period with about one third of the residents deceasing each year. Individual resident characteristics appeared to be more important than organizational variables for predicting mortality risk. The finding of an association between ward size and mortality risk deserves further investigation in future studies."

Establishing a causal link between circuit dysfunction and particular behavioral traits that are relevant to schizophrenia is crucial to shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the pathology. We studied an animal model of the human 22q11 deletion syndrome, the mutation that represents the highest genetic risk of developing schizophrenia. We observed a desynchronization of hippocampal neuronal assemblies that resulted from parvalbumin interneuron hypoexcitability. Rescuing parvalbumin interneuron excitability with pharmacological or chemogenetic approaches was sufficient to restore wild-type-like CA1 network dynamics and hippocampal-dependent behavior during adulthood. In conclusion, our data provide insights into the network dysfunction underlying schizophrenia and highlight the use of reverse engineering to restore physiological and behavioral phenotypes in an animal model of neurodevelopmental disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2890879010,"Efforts are being directed to systematically analyze the non-coding regions of the genome for cancer-driving mutations1-6. cis-regulatory elements (CREs) represent a highly enriched subset of the non-coding regions of the genome in which to search for such mutations. Here we use high-throughput chromosome conformation capture techniques (Hi-C) for 19,023 promoter fragments to catalog the regulatory landscape of colorectal cancer in cell lines, mapping CREs and integrating these with whole-genome sequence and expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas7,8. We identify a recurrently mutated CRE interacting with the ETV1 promoter affecting gene expression. ETV1 expression influences cell viability and is associated with patient survival. We further refine our understanding of the regulatory effects of copy-number variations, showing that RASL11A is targeted by a previously identified enhancer amplification1. This study reveals new insights into the complex genetic alterations driving tumor development, providing a paradigm for employing chromosome conformation capture to decipher non-coding CREs relevant to cancer biology."
https://openalex.org/W2892139824,"The evolution of the mammalian jaw is one of the most important innovations in vertebrate history, and underpins the exceptional radiation and diversification of mammals over the last 220 million years1,2. In particular, the transformation of the mandible into a single tooth-bearing bone and the emergence of a novel jaw joint—while incorporating some of the ancestral jaw bones into the mammalian middle ear—is often cited as a classic example of the repurposing of morphological structures3,4. Although it is remarkably well-documented in the fossil record, the evolution of the mammalian jaw still poses the paradox of how the bones of the ancestral jaw joint could function both as a joint hinge for powerful load-bearing mastication and as a mandibular middle ear that was delicate enough for hearing. Here we use digital reconstructions, computational modelling and biomechanical analyses to demonstrate that the miniaturization of the early mammalian jaw was the primary driver for the transformation of the jaw joint. We show that there is no evidence for a concurrent reduction in jaw-joint stress and increase in bite force in key non-mammaliaform taxa in the cynodont–mammaliaform transition, as previously thought5–8. Although a shift in the recruitment of the jaw musculature occurred during the evolution of modern mammals, the optimization of mandibular function to increase bite force while reducing joint loads did not occur until after the emergence of the neomorphic mammalian jaw joint. This suggests that miniaturization provided a selective regime for the evolution of the mammalian jaw joint, followed by the integration of the postdentary bones into the mammalian middle ear."
https://openalex.org/W2891577081,"Cancers must maintain their telomeres at lengths sufficient for cell survival. In several cancer subtypes, a recombination-like mechanism termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), is frequently used for telomere length maintenance. Cancers utilizing ALT often have lost functional ATRX, a chromatin remodeling protein, through mutation or deletion, thereby strongly implicating ATRX as an ALT suppressor. Herein, we have generated functional ATRX knockouts in four telomerase-positive, ALT-negative human glioma cell lines: MOG-G-UVW, SF188, U-251 and UW479. After loss of ATRX, two of the four cell lines (U-251 and UW479) show multiple characteristics of ALT-positive cells, including ultrabright telomeric DNA foci, ALT-associated PML bodies, and c-circles. However, telomerase activity and overall telomere length heterogeneity are unaffected after ATRX loss, regardless of cellular context. The two cell lines that showed ALT hallmarks after complete ATRX loss also did so upon ATRX depletion via shRNA-mediated knockdown. These results suggest that other genomic or epigenetic events, in addition to ATRX loss, are necessary for the induction of ALT in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2890426317,"Epigenetics is involved in sex differentiation of gonochoristic and hermaphroditic fish species, whereby two genes dmrt1 (pro-male) and cyp19a1 (pro-female) are known to play major roles. Barramundi, Lates calcarifer, is an important tropical aquaculture species that undergo natural and permanent male to female sex change, a process for which the exact underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown. To elucidate whether DNA methylation is involved in sex control of barramundi, a next-generation bisulfite amplicon sequencing approach was used to target 146 CpG sites within proximal promoters and first exons of seven sex-related genes (dmrt1, cyp19a1, amh, foxl2, nr5a2, sox8 and sox9) of 24 testis and 18 ovaries of captive and wild adult barramundi. Moreover, comparative expression profiles of the key dmrt1 and cyp19a1 genes were further investigated using RT-qPCR and Sanger sequencing approaches, whereas expression levels of remaining targeted genes were based on available literature for the species. Results showed that cyp19a1 and amh were more methylated in males, whereas dmrt1 and nr5a2 were more methylated in females (P < 0.001), with no gender differences found for foxl2, sox8 or sox9 genes (P > 0.05). Sex-biased promoter DNA methylation was inversely related to gene expression only for dmrt1 and nr5a2, and directly related to amh expression, whereas no differences in cyp19a1 expression were found between testes and ovaries. Notably, unique sex-specific alternative splicing of dmrt1 and cyp19a1 were discovered, whereby males lacked the full-length aromatase coding cyp19a1 mRNA due to partial or total exon splicing, and females lacked the dmrt1 exon containing the DM-domain sequence. This study advances the current knowledge aiming to elucidate the genetic mechanisms within male and female gonads of this large protandrous hermaphrodite by providing the first evidence of epigenetics and alternative splicing simultaneously affecting key genes (cyp19a1 and dmrt1) central to sex differentiation pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2889711527,"Approximately 85% of a single administered dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) will be degraded by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DYPD). Studies have highlighted a link between the complete or partial loss of DYPD function and clinical responses to 5-FU; however, the underlying molecular basis of DPD deficiency remains poorly understood. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevailing hypothesis which suggests that overexpression of LINC00261 possesses the ability to modulate the methylation-dependent repression of DPYD, ultimately resulting in an elevation of the sensitivity of human esophageal cancer cells to 5-FU. LINC00261 levels were initially quantified, followed by analysis of DYPD methylation within the cancerous tissues collected from 75 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer undergoing 5-FU–based adjuvant chemotherapy. In an attempt to determine the levels of LINC00261 related to the esophageal cancer cell resistance to 5-FU and to identify the interaction between the levels of LINC00261 and methylation of the DYPD promoter, esophageal cancer cells TE-1 and -5 were prepared, in which LINC00261 and the 5-FU–resistant TE-1 and -5 cells were overexpressed. The levels of LINC00261 were reduced among the cancerous tissues obtained from patients exhibiting resistance to 5-FU. Overexpression of LINC00261 was determined to dramatically inhibit proliferation and resistance to apoptosis among 5-FU–resistant TE-1 and -5 cells, whereas silencing of LINC00261 was determined to enhance proliferation and resistance to apoptosis among the TE-1 and -5 cells. DPYD, a confirmed target of LINC00261, displayed a greater incidence of DNA methylation among patient's sensitive to 5-FU. A key finding revealed that overexpressed LINC00261 could increase the methylation of the DPYD promoter through the recruitment of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), which, in turn, acts to decrease DPYD activity in 5-FU–resistant TE-1 cells, whereas a reversible change was recorded once the demethylation reagent 5-aza-2′-deoxyctidine was employed to treat the 5-FU–resistant TE-1 cells. Taken together, the results of the study provided evidence emphasizing the distinct antitumor ability of LINC00261 in cases of esophageal cancer, which was manifested by overexpression of LINC00261 detected to increase the sensitivity of human esophageal cancer cells to 5-FU by mediating methylation-dependent repression of DPYD. Our study highlighted the potential of LINC00261 as a novel target capable of improving the chemotherapeutic response and survival of patients with esophageal cancer.—Lin, K., Jiang, H., Zhuang, S.-S., Qin, Y.-S., Qiu, G.-D., She, Y.-Q., Zheng, J.-T., Chen, C., Fang, L., Zhang, S.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2889869864,"Home range estimators are a critical component for understanding animal spatial ecology. The choice of home range estimator in spatial ecology studies can significantly influence management and conservation actions, as different methods lead to vastly different interpretations of movement patterns, habitat selection, as well as home range requirements. Reptile studies in particular have struggled to reach a consensus on the appropriate home range estimators to use, and species with cryptic behavior make home range assessment difficult. We applied dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMMs) to radio-telemetry data from Ophiophagus hannah, a wide-ranging snake species. We used two focal individuals at different life stages (one juvenile male and one adult male) and sought to identify whether the method would accurately represent both their home range and movement patterns. To assess the suitability of dBBMMs, we compared this novel method with traditional home range estimation methods: minimum convex polygons (MCP) and Kernel density estimators (KDE). Both KDE and MCP incorporated higher levels of Type I and Type II errors, which would lead to biases in our understanding of this species space-use and habitat selection. Although these methods identified some general spatial-temporal patterns, dBBMMs were more efficient at detecting movement corridors and accurately representing long-term shelters sites, showing an improvement over methods traditionally favored in reptile studies. The additional flexibility of the dBBMM approach in providing insight into movement patterns can help further improve conservation and management actions. Additionally, our results suggest that dBBMMs may be more widely applicable in studies that rely on VHF telemetry and not limited to studies employing GPS tags."

Through microarray analysis, linc-SCRG1 (a lncRNA with transcript length 3118 bp) was found up-regulated 13.62-fold in human cirrhotic tissues. Quantitative PCR verified that linc-SCRG1 increased along with liver fibrosis progression in human tissues and in activated LX2 cells induced by TGF-β1. Knockdown of linc-SCRG1 significantly reversed the effects of TGF-β1 on LX2, including inhibiting activation, promoting apoptosis, reducing proliferation, lessening invasion, and down-regulating genes [fibrosis-related mRNA: α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA), type I collagen, and B-cell lymphoma-2; invasion-related mRNA: matrix metallopeptidase-2 ( MMP-2), MMP-9, and MMP-13; inflammation-related mRNA: TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10]. linc-SCRG1 had binding sites with tristetraprolin (TTP), a kind of RNA-binding protein, and specifically combined to TTP proteins. Overexpression of linc-SCRG1 would cause TTP mRNA unstably and proteins decreasing. TTP mRNA was proved having negative relevance with linc-SCRG1 and was gradually reduced during human liver fibrosis progression. Overexpressing TTP resulted in knockdown of lincSCRG1 and degraded downstream target genes ( MMP-2 and TNF-α) in activated LX2. Overexpressing TTP had the same effects as small interfering RNA-lincSCRG1 (si- lincSCRG1), whereas knockdown of TTP had reversal effects on si- lincSCRG1 in activated LX2. In summary, linc-SCRG1 reduced TTP and restricted its degradation of target genes TNF-α and MMP-2. Therefore, linc-SCRG1 had a repressing TTP-elicited inactivation effect on hepatic stellate cell (HSC) phenotypes. Inhibition of linc-SCRG1 may be a novel therapeutic approach to inactivate HSCs and extenuate human liver fibrosis.-Wu, J.-C., Luo, S.-Z., Liu, T., Lu, L.-G., Xu, M.-Y. linc-SCRG1 accelerates liver fibrosis by decreasing RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin."
https://openalex.org/W2889892052,"The etiological spectrum of ultra-rare developmental disorders remains to be fully defined. Chromatin regulatory mechanisms maintain cellular identity and function, where misregulation may lead to developmental defects. Here, we report pathogenic variations in MSL3, which encodes a member of the chromatin-associated male-specific lethal (MSL) complex responsible for bulk histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) in flies and mammals. These variants cause an X-linked syndrome affecting both sexes. Clinical features of the syndrome include global developmental delay, progressive gait disturbance, and recognizable facial dysmorphism. MSL3 mutations affect MSL complex assembly and activity, accompanied by a pronounced loss of H4K16ac levels in vivo. Patient-derived cells display global transcriptome alterations of pathways involved in morphogenesis and cell migration. Finally, we use histone deacetylase inhibitors to rebalance acetylation levels, alleviating some of the molecular and cellular phenotypes of patient cells. Taken together, we characterize a syndrome that allowed us to decipher the developmental importance of MSL3 in humans. De novo mutations in MSL3 cause an X-linked syndrome affecting both males and females. MSL3 mutations reduce H4K16ac levels and lead to misregulation of cellular pathways involved in morphogenesis, cellular shape, and cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2889566684,"Isotopic replacement has long-proven applications in small molecules. However, applications in proteins are largely limited to biosynthetic strategies or exchangeable (for example, N–H/D) labile sites only. The development of postbiosynthetic, C–1H → C–2H/D replacement in proteins could enable probing of mechanisms, among other uses. Here we describe a chemical method for selective protein α-carbon deuteration (proceeding from Cys to dehydroalanine (Dha) to deutero-Cys) allowing overall 1H→2H/D exchange at a nonexchangeable backbone site. It is used here to probe mechanisms of reactions used in protein bioconjugation. This analysis suggests, together with quantum mechanical calculations, stepwise deprotonations via on-protein carbanions and unexpected sulfonium ylides in the conversion of Cys to Dha, consistent with a ‘carba-Swern’ mechanism. The ready application on existing, intact protein constructs (without specialized culture or genetic methods) suggests this C–D labeling strategy as a possible tool in protein mechanism, structure, biotechnology and medicine.

Both plastomes are circular DNA molecules (146754 bp for O. sphegodes and 150177 bp for O. iricolor) with the typical quadripartite structure of plastid genomes and within the average size of photosynthetic orchids. 213 Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) (31.5% polymorphic between O. iricolor and O. sphegodes) were identified, with homopolymers and dipolymers as the most common repeat types. SSRs were mainly located in intergenic regions but SSRs located in coding regions were also found, mainly in ycf1 and rpoC2 genes. The Ophrys plastome is predicted to encode 107 distinct genes, 17 of which are completely duplicated in the Inverted Repeat regions. 83 and 87 putative RNA editing sites were detected in 25 plastid genes of the two Ophrys species, all occurring in the first or second codon position. Comparing the rate of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions, 24 genes (including rbcL and ycf1) display signature consistent with positive selection. When compared with other members of the orchid family, the Ophrys plastome has a complete set of 11 functional ndh plastid genes, with the exception of O. sphegodes that has a truncated ndhF gene. Comparative analysis showed a large co-linearity with other related Orchidinae. However, in contrast to O. iricolor and other Orchidinae, O. sphegodes has a shift of the junction between the Inverted Repeat and Small Single Copy regions associated with the loss of the partial duplicated gene ycf1 and the truncation of the ndhF gene. Data on relative genomic coverage and validation by PCR indicate the presence, with a different ratio, of the two plastome types (i.e. with and without ndhF deletion) in both Ophrys species, with a predominance of the deleted type in O. sphegodes. A search for this deleted plastid region in O. sphegodes nuclear genome shows that the deleted region is inserted in a retrotransposon nuclear sequence. The present study provides useful genomic tools for studying conservation and patterns of relationships of this rapidly radiating orchid genus."
https://openalex.org/W2890225916,"Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 2 (ALS2) is a juvenile autosomal recessive motor neuron disease caused by the mutations in the ALS2 gene. The ALS2 gene product, ALS2/alsin, forms a homophilic oligomer and acts as a guanine nucleotide–exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rab5. This oligomerization is crucial for both Rab5 activation and ALS2-mediated endosome fusion and maturation in cells. Recently, we have shown that pathogenic missense ALS2 mutants retaining the Rab5 GEF activity fail to properly localize to endosomes via Rac1-stimulated macropinocytosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulated distribution of ALS2 variants remain poorly understood. Therefore, we sought to clarify the relationship between intracellular localization and oligomeric states of pathogenic ALS2 variants. Upon Rac family small GTPase 1 (Rac1) activation, all mutants tested moved from the cytosol to membrane ruffles but not to macropinosomes and/or endosomes. Furthermore, most WT ALS2 complexes were tetramers. Importantly, the sizes of an ALS2 complex carrying missense mutations in the N terminus of the regulator of chromosome condensation 1–like domain (RLD) or in-frame deletion in the pleckstrin homology domain were shifted toward higher molecular weight, whereas the C-terminal vacuolar protein sorting 9 (VPS9) domain missense mutant existed as a smaller dimeric or trimeric smaller form. Furthermore, in silico mutagenesis analyses using the RLD protein structure in conjunction with a cycloheximide chase assay in vitro disclosed that these missense mutations led to a decrease in protein stability. Collectively, disorganized higher structures of ALS2 variants might explain their impaired endosomal localization and the stability, leading to loss of the ALS2 function.

It has been reported that ALS2C157Y is preferentially degraded by the UPS when compared with WT ALS2 (16Eymard-Pierre E. Yamanaka K. Haeussler M. Kress W. Gauthier-Barichard F. Combes P. Cleveland D.W. Boespflug-Tanguy O. Novel missense mutation in ALS2 gene results in infantile ascending hereditary spastic paralysis.Ann. Neurol. 2006; 59 (16718699): 976-98010.1002/ana.20879Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that, although both ALS2C157Y and ALS2G540E variants retain the Rab5 GEF activity in vitro, they fail to localize to macropinosomes and early endosomes upon Rac1 activation when ectopically expressed in cells (34Otomo A. Kunita R. Suzuki-Utsunomiya K. Ikeda J.E. Hadano S. Defective relocalization of ALS2/alsin missense mutants to Rac1-induced macropinosomes accounts for loss of their cellular function and leads to disturbed amphisome formation.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585 (21300063): 730-73610.1016/j.febslet.2011.01.045Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that such abnormal cellular behaviors of missense ALS2 variants are also implicated in loss of the ALS2 function. However, due to a limited number of pathogenic variants analyzed thus far, it is still too early to conclude as such, let alone underlying molecular mechanism for ALS2-linked MNDs. Previously, we have shown that ALS2 interacts with itself through the C-terminal region, forming a homophilic oligomer (35Kunita R. Otomo A. Mizumura H. Suzuki K. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Hadano S. Ikeda J.E. Homo-oligomerization of ALS2 through its unique carboxyl-terminal regions is essential for the ALS2-associated Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange activity and its regulatory function on endosome trafficking.J.

Importantly, this homo-oligomerization is not only crucial for the Rab5 GEF activity in vitro but also for the ALS2-mediated endosome fusion in cells (11Kunita R. Otomo A. Mizumura H. Suzuki-Utsunomiya K. Hadano S. Ikeda J.E. The Rab5 activator ALS2/alsin acts as a novel Rac1 effector through Rac1-activated endocytosis.J. Biol.

These results lend credence to the hypothesis that structural abnormalities in pathogenic missense and/or in-frame deletion ALS2 variants are closely linked to loss of its cellular function, and therefore that formation of the proper ALS2 complex might be a prerequisite for Rac1-induced endosomal localization of ALS2 and the following activation of endosomal Rab5. To prove this hypothesis, we here sought to clarify the relationship between intracellular localization and oligomeric states of several missense and in-frame deletion pathogenic ALS2 variants by conducting a series of immunocytochemical and biochemical analyses. In addition, to further gain insight into the structural basis of missense mutations, we generated a protein structure of N-terminal RLD harboring the majority of the missense pathogenic mutations, and we performed an in silico mutagenesis analyses to evaluate the potential effects of those mutations on the structure. We here demonstrated evidence showing that the altered oligomerization and/or destabilization of ALS2 was implicated in their impaired endosomal localization. Our data may provide important clues to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of ALS2-linked MNDs. Previously, we have demonstrated that the majority of the ectopically expressed WT ALS2 protein (ALS2WT) is scattered throughout the cytoplasm in HeLa and COS-7 cells (10Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.E.

Genet. 2003; 12 (12837691): 1671-168710.1093/hmg/ddg184Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Upon Rac1 activation, ALS2WT is recruited to membrane ruffles and then relocalized to macropinosomes and early endosomes via Rac1-stimulated macropinocytosis (11Kunita R. Otomo A. Mizumura H.

By contrast, two pathogenic ALS2 variants, ALS2C157Y and ALS2G540E, fail to be localized to macropinosomes and early endosomes (34Otomo A. Kunita R. Suzuki-Utsunomiya K. Ikeda J.E. Hadano S.

To clarify the intracellular behavior of other missense as well as small in-frame deletion ALS2 variants, which have been newly identified but yet to be tested, we chose three representative pathogenic ALS2 variants: ALS2S100I, the N-terminal RLD missense variant (14Luigetti M.

Using these variants, we investigated the changes in their intracellular distributions by the Rac1 activation.

The presence of distinct populations of corneal leukocytes (CLs) in the normal cornea has been firmly established. However, their precise function and kinetics remain, as of yet, unclear. Through intravital multiphoton microscopy (IV-MPM), allowing the means to accumulate critical spatial and temporal cellular information, we provide details for long-term investigation of CL morphology and kinetics under steady state and following inflammation. Significant alterations in size and morphology of corneal CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) were noted following acute sterile inflammation, including cell volume (4364.4 ± 489.6 vs. 1787.6 ± 111.0 μm3, P < 0.001) and sphericity (0.82 ± 0.01 vs. 0.42 ± 0.02, P < 0.001) compared with steady state. Furthermore, IV-MPM analyses revealed alterations in both the CD11c+ DC and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC)-II+ mature antigen-presenting cell population kinetics during inflammation, including track displacement length (CD11c: 16.57 ± 1.41 vs. 4.64 ± 0.56 μm, P < 0.001; MHC-II: 9.03 ± 0.37 vs. 4.09 ± 0.39, P < 0.001) and velocity (CD11c: 1.91 ± 0.07 μm/min vs. 1.73 ± 0.1302 μm/min; MHC-II: 2.97 ± 0.07 vs. 1.62 ± 0.08, P < 0.001) compared with steady state.

https://openalex.org/W2890818252,"In this paper, we examine the inequality in the dynamics of the total fertility rate within 21 sub-Saharan African countries by wealth quintiles. We also examine the associated inequality within each country in the proximate determinants of fertility–marriage, contraception, and breastfeeding. Applying Bongaarts’ proximate determinants of fertility framework, for 14/21 countries we analyze, we find that those in the richest wealth quintiles have had a more rapid decline in fertility rates than those in the poorest wealth quintiles. The rapid decline for those in the richest wealth quintiles is attributable to delayed marriage and modest increases in contraceptive use. Although the poorest lag in fertility decline, postpartum abstinence and breastfeeding are the most important factors for them for fertility regulation. Further encouraging maternal health programs that focus on natural methods of fertility regulation will work in favor of the poorest in sub-Saharan Africa in moving through the demographic transition."

The current model, being based primarily on genetic analyses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and companion biochemical reconstitution studies, posits that end resection proceeds in two distinct stages. Specifically, the initiation of resection is mediated by the nuclease activity of the Mre11–Rad50–Xrs2 (MRX) complex in conjunction with its cofactor Sae2, and long-range resection is carried out by exonuclease 1 (Exo1) or the Sgs1–Top3–Rmi1–Dna2 ensemble. Using fully reconstituted systems, we show here that DNA with ends occluded by the DNA end-joining factor Ku70–Ku80 becomes a suitable substrate for long-range 5′–3′ resection when a nick is introduced at a locale proximal to one of the Ku-bound DNA ends. We also show that Sgs1 can unwind duplex DNA harboring a nick, in a manner dependent on a species-specific interaction with the ssDNA-binding factor replication protein A (RPA).

Importantly, RPA also protects the resulting 3′-terminated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tail from nucleolytic attack, and the RPA–ssDNA complex serves to recruit the Mec1–Ddc2 (ATR–ATRIP in mammals) kinase complex for DNA damage checkpoint activation. For HR to proceed, RPA must first be replaced by the recombinase enzyme Rad51. RPA-Rad51 exchange on ssDNA is facilitated by HR mediators, such as Rad52 in yeast and the tumor suppressor BRCA2 in complex with the DSS1 protein in humans (27Jensen R.B. Carreira A.

However, whether the DNA nick introduced by MRX–Sae2 serves directly as a suitable entry site for Exo1 or Sgs1–Dna2 to initiate long-range resection remains to be determined. Here, using reconstituted systems with highly purified end resection factors and plasmid-length DNA substrates, we show that 1) Ku binding to DNA ends poses an obstacle to Exo1 or Sgs1–Dna2, but this inhibitory effect is relieved by the introduction of a DNA nick proximal to one of the Ku-bound DNA ends; 2) both Exo1 and Sgs1–Dna2 can carry out long-range DNA end resection from a DNA nick with a 5′ to 3′ polarity; and 3) Sgs1 helicase is able to unwind double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) harboring a nick or a gap, which depends on its species-specific interaction with RPA. These findings support a model wherein a DNA nick created by MRX–Sae2 at Ku-blocked DSB ends can serve as the entry site for Exo1 or Sgs1–Dna2. These findings are likely relevant for understanding the mechanism of resection of other types of protein-blocked DSB ends, such as Spo11-conjugated ends at meiotic DSBs or arrested topoisomerase–DNA conjugates (33Tammaro M. Liao S. Beeharry N. Yan H. DNA double-strand breaks with 5′ adducts are efficiently channeled to the DNA2-mediated resection pathway.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26420828): 221-23110.1093/nar/gkv969Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Garcia V.

MRX–Sae2 incises the 5′-terminated DNA strand endonucleolytically within the vicinity of Ku-occluded DNA ends (21Wang W. Daley J.M. Kwon Y. Krasner D.S. Sung P. Plasticity of the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2-Sae2 nuclease ensemble in the processing of DNA-bound obstacles.Genes Dev. 2017; 31 (29321177): 2331-233610.1101/gad.307900.117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Reginato G.

To mimic the endonucleolytically cleaved DNA generated by MRX–Sae2, we inserted an Nt.BbvCI nicking endonuclease recognition sequence proximal to the DNA end. An incision site 59 nucleotides (nt) away from the 5′-terminated DNA end was introduced by Nt.BbvCI digestion (Fig. 1A). We first tested the nuclease activity of Exo1 on the 3′-32P-labeled nicked dsDNA. As shown in Fig. S1A, Exo1 was able to resect dsDNA or nicked dsDNA with a comparable efficiency when there was no Ku at the DNA ends. Likewise, in the absence of Ku, Sgs1–Dna2 was also able to resect dsDNA with or without a nick equally well (Fig. S1B). We next tested the effect of Ku on Exo1- or Sgs1–Dna2-mediated long-range DNA end resection. On dsDNA without a nick, digestion by Exo1 or Sgs1–Dna2 was attenuated when we preincubated the DNA substrate with Ku, indicating that Ku restricts the access of Exo1 or Sgs1–Dna2 to DNA ends (Fig. 1, B and C). Importantly, the inhibitory effect of Ku on Exo1- or Sgs1–Dna2-mediated resection was significantly lessened upon introducing the site-specific nick into the DNA substrate (Fig. 1, B and C). Altogether, these results indicate that Ku protects DNA ends from nucleolytic digestion by Exo1 or Sgs1–Dna2 and also provide evidence that Exo1 and Sgs1–Dna2 can initiate DNA resection from a DNA nick. The latter premise is further validated in studies described below. Our previous findings indicate that MRX–Sae2 creates nicks ∼40 or ∼60 nt away from Ku-blocked DNA ends (21Wang W. Daley J.M. Kwon Y. Krasner D.S. Sung P. Plasticity of the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2-Sae2 nuclease ensemble in the processing of DNA-bound obstacles.Genes Dev. 2017; 31 (29321177): 2331-233610.1101/gad.307900.117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of the distance between nick and DNA end on resection activity, DNA substrates with nicks in different positions (41, 59, or 82 nt away from DNA ends) were utilized. As shown in Fig. S1C, Exo1 processed these nicks equally well when DNA ends were blocked by Ku. Likewise, no obvious difference was seen with Sgs1–Dna2 on these DNA substrates (Fig. S1D). Based on the above observations (Fig. 1), we surmised that a DNA nick can serve as an entry site for Exo1- or Sgs1–Dna2-mediated resection. To eliminate the possibility of strand resection by Exo1 or Sgs1–Dna2 initiating from a free end, we constructed a circular dsDNA substrate that harbors a unique nick at which the 3′ terminus was labeled with 32P (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. S2A, Exo1 alone was able to digest the circular nicked dsDNA substrate. The cleavage pattern of Exo1 on this DNA substrate was similar to that seen with bacteriophage T7 exonuclease, which has a strict 5′–3′ polarity (Fig. S2B) and is known to catalyze 5′ nucleotide removal at a DNA nick (35Kerr C. Sadowski P.D. Gene 6 exonuclease of bacteriophage T7. II. mechanism of the reaction.J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247 (4553438): 311-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kerr C. Sadowski P.D.

We further tested Exo1 alone or in combination with RPA and/or MRX on the nick-containing DNA substrate. As shown in Fig. 2B, the digestion of the circular nicked dsDNA by Exo1 was enhanced by RPA or MRX. The stimulatory effect of RPA stems from its ability to sequester ssDNA to prevent the formation of nonproductive Exo1–ssDNA complexes (37Cannavo E. Cejka P. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Dna2, Sgs1, and RPA constitute the minimal set of proteins capable of long-range DNA end resection (25Niu H. Chung W.H. Zhu Z. Kwon Y. Zhao W. Chi P. Prakash R. Seong C. Liu D. Lu L. Ira G. Sung P.

In agreement with our previous observation (25Niu H. Chung W.H. Zhu Z. Kwon Y. Zhao W. Chi P. Prakash R. Seong C. Liu D. Lu L. Ira G. Sung P. Mechanism of the ATP-dependent DNA end-resection machinery from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nature. 2010; 467 (20811460): 108-11110.1038/nature09318Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), resection of DNA from the nick by Sgs1–Dna2–RPA was stimulated by Top3–Rmi1 (TR) or MRX, with an additive effect being seen upon combining the latter two components (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these results provide evidence that Exo1 and Sgs1–Dna2 can initiate long-range resection from a DNA nick and that this activity is up-regulated by known cofactors of these enzymatic entities. We used Southern blotting to determine the directionality of Exo1- or Sgs1–Dna2-mediated resection that is initiated from a DNA nick in plasmid DNA. Two radiolabeled probes were used: P500 and P2500 that are complementary to the circular DNA strand near and further away from the 5′ terminus of the DNA nick (Fig. 3A). A time-course analysis showed that, at the early time points, nuclease products generated by Exo1 were detectable by P500 but not by P2500 (Fig. 3B), indicating that it carries out 5′ strand resection from the nick. A 5′–3′ polarity of resection was also seen with Sgs1–Dna2 (Fig. 3C). The final reaction product, detectable by hybridization with either P500 or P2500 (Fig. 3B and 3C), has the same size as that generated by T7 exonuclease (Fig. 3, E and F). As expected, the final reaction product was not recognized by the radiolabeled probe P2500R that is complementary to the nicked DNA strand in the substrate (Fig. 3, D and F). Although Dna2 alone was able to digest circular ssDNA (39Fortini B.K. Pokharel S. Polaczek P. Balakrishnan L. Bambara R.A. Campbell J.L. Characterization of the endonuclease and ATP-dependent flap endo/exonuclease of Dna2.J. Biol.

Taken together, these results support a model wherein Exo1 or Sgs1–Dna2–RPA specifically resects DNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction from the nick, generating a ssDNA circle that is protected by RPA from digestion. Sgs1 provides the helicase activity to unwind long stretches of duplex DNA during long-range end resection (25Niu H. Chung W.H. Zhu Z. Kwon Y. Zhao W. Chi P. Prakash R. Seong C. Liu D. Lu L. Ira G. Sung P. Mechanism of the ATP-dependent DNA end-resection machinery from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nature. 2010; 467 (20811460): 108-11110.1038/nature09318Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 26Cejka P.

We therefore asked whether Sgs1 could release the strand that harbors the nick from the circular DNA substrate (Fig. 5A). Sgs1 could completely unwind a significant fraction of the nicked circular substrate when RPA was present (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the Mph1 helicase showed no activity on this substrate (Fig. S3A). Consistent with published results (40Cobb J.A. Bjergbaek L. Shimada K. Frei C. Gasser S.M. DNA polymerase stabilization at stalled replication forks requires Mec1 and the RecQ helicase Sgs1.EMBO J. 2003; 22 (12912929): 4325-433610.1093/emboj/cdg391Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 41Hegnauer A.M.

In contrast, only a weak interaction of Sgs1 and human RPA (hRPA) was detected under the same reaction conditions (Fig. S3C). Importantly, the unwinding of the nicked DNA substrate by Sgs1 relies on its species-specific interaction with RPA as a much reduced level of fully unwound product occurred upon the substitution of yeast RPA with human RPA or with either of the human single-strand DNA-binding protein complexes SOSS1 and SOSS2 (Fig. 5C and Fig. S3B). The failure to stimulate Sgs1 is not due to protein inactivity as hRPA, SOSS1, and SOSS2 are fully capable of binding ssDNA (Fig. S3D). Although Escherichia coli SSB also supported DNA unwinding by Sgs1, its stimulatory effect was less than that of yeast RPA (Fig. 5C). Sgs1-mediated unwinding of the nicked substrate was also stimulated by TR and MRX individually (Fig. S3, E and F), and an additive effect was seen upon combining the latter two factors (Fig. 5D). We also verified that the stimulatory effect of TR and MRX on Sgs1-mediated unwinding is reliant on RPA (Fig. 5D). A recent study from our laboratory has provided direct evidence that MRX–Sae2 utilizes its 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity to create a DNA gap from an incision site (21Wang W. Daley J.M. Kwon Y. Krasner D.S. Sung P. Plasticity of the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2-Sae2 nuclease ensemble in the processing of DNA-bound obstacles.Genes Dev. 2017; 31 (29321177): 2331-233610.1101/gad.307900.117Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We therefore tested Sgs1 for the ability to unwind a 3-kb circular dsDNA containing a 46-nt DNA gap. As shown in Fig. 5E and Fig. S3G, Sgs1 was able to unwind the gapped substrate in the presence of RPA. Compared with the nicked DNA, the gapped substrate was unwound more efficiently by Sgs1 (Fig. 5E and Fig. S3G). By virtue of its abundance and high affinity for DNA ends, Ku is among the first protein factors that arrive at DSBs within the cellular setting where it not only promotes break repair by NHEJ (15Yang G.

https://openalex.org/W2890618162,"Vascular pathology is central to malaria pathogenesis and associated with severity of disease. We have previously documented shedding of the cerebral endothelial glycocalyx in experimental malaria and hypothesized that this action is implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria (CM). Quantification and characterization of the intraluminal vascular glycocalyx are technically challenging. Here, we used ferritin labeling, computerized image analysis, and biochemical characterization by using in vivo biotinylation and pull down. Image analysis divided mice with CM and uncomplicated malaria and uninfected control mice into 3 non-overlapping groups. Biochemical assessment of the luminal surface revealed malaria-induced alterations in all components of the glycocalyx in CM. This loss was mirrored in increases of the same components in peripheral blood samples. Corticosteroid treatment protected against CM, reduced inflammation, and prevented glycocalyx loss. Adjunctive antithrombin-3 also prevented glycocalyx loss and significantly reduced CM-associated mortality, as well as reduced local inflammation and prevented blood-brain barrier leakage. In contrast, inhibition of matrix metalloproteases with batimastat had limited effects on the glycocalyx and disease progression. Thus, glycocalyx loss may be associated with malaria pathogenesis and could be targeted by adjunctive treatment.-Hempel, C., Sporring, J., Kurtzhals, J. A. L. Experimental cerebral malaria is associated with profound loss of both glycan and protein components of the endothelial glycocalyx."

Their role in predicting the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is not well established. We tested the performance of several biomarkers in risk assessment for SCD in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and preserved left ventricular function. Methods and results The study population consisted of 1,946 CAD patients (68% male; mean age 66.9±8.6 yrs; type 2 diabetes (T2D) 43%) enrolled in the ARTEMIS study. The study subjects underwent examinations with echocardiography and measurement of several biomarkers. The primary endpoint of the study was SCD. During the mean follow up of 76±20 months 50 patients experienced SCD. Elevated high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP, p = 0.001), soluble ST2 (sST2, p<0.001), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP, p<0.001), and highly sensitive TroponinT (hs-TnT, p<0.001) predicted the occurrence of SCD in univariate analysis. Using the optimal cutoff points, elevated sST2 (≥27.45ng/mL; hazard ratio [HR] 2.7; 95%CI 1.4–5.1, p = 0.003) and hs-TnT (≥15 ng/mL; HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.5–5.6, p = 0.002) were the strongest predictors of SCD followed by hs-CRP (HR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3–4.4, p = 0.004) and BNP (HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.0–3.7, p = 0.046) in adjusted analysis. Combination of elevated hs-TnT and sST2 resulted in adjusted HR of 6.4 (95% CI 2.6–15.5, p<0.001). Conclusion Elevated sST2 and hs-TnT predict the occurrence of SCD among patients with CAD and preserved left ventricular function. The association between sST2, hs-TnT and SCD may be explained by an ongoing myocardial apoptosis followed by fibrosis leading to vulnerability to malignant arrhythmias."

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, COX is composed of 11–13 different polypeptide subunits. Here, using pulse labeling of mitochondrial gene products in isolated yeast mitochondria, combined with purification of tagged COX subunits and ancillary factors, we studied the Cox2p assembly intermediates. Analysis of radiolabeled Cox2p obtained in pulldown assays by native gel electrophoresis revealed the existence of several assembly intermediates, the largest of which had an estimated mass of 450–550 kDa. None of the other known subunits of COX were present in these Cox2p intermediates. This was also true for the several ancillary factors having still undefined functions in COX assembly. In agreement with earlier evidence, Cox18p and Cox20p, previously shown to be involved in processing and in membrane insertion of the Cox2p precursor, were found to be associated with the two largest Cox2p intermediates. A small fraction of the Cox2p module contained Sco1p and Coa6p, which have been implicated in metalation of the binuclear copper site on this subunit.

Analysis of radiolabeled Cox2p obtained in pulldown assays by native gel electrophoresis revealed the existence of several assembly intermediates, the largest of which had an estimated mass of 450–550 kDa. None of the other known subunits of COX were present in these Cox2p intermediates. This was also true for the several ancillary factors having still undefined functions in COX assembly. In agreement with earlier evidence, Cox18p and Cox20p, previously shown to be involved in processing and in membrane insertion of the Cox2p precursor, were found to be associated with the two largest Cox2p intermediates. A small fraction of the Cox2p module contained Sco1p and Coa6p, which have been implicated in metalation of the binuclear copper site on this subunit. Our results indicate that following its insertion into the mitochondrial inner membrane, Cox2p assembles as a stand-alone protein with the compositionally more complex Cox1p and Cox3p modules."

Twenty-two dogs with gastric dilatation-volvulus were included, being classified as survivors or non-survivors based on the final outcome. Dogs with intestinal obstruction (n = 16) were selected for comparison. Blood samples were collected upon admission (T0) and after 24 hours (T1). Serum lipase activity, canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI) and other variables (plasma lactate concentration and C- reactive protein -CRP- in particular) were evaluated as predictive variables. T0 cPLI and serum lipase activity were not found to differ significantly between dogs with gastric dilatation-volvulus or intestinal obstruction. Canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity values above 400 μg/L were detected in 6/22 dogs with gastric dilatation-volvulus and 4/16 with intestinal obstruction. However, lactate concentration was significantly higher and CRP significantly lower in GDV as compared to IO dogs, and in the GDV group, lipase, cPLI and CRP measured upon admission were significantly associated with a negative outcome. No differences in lipase activity and canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity values were detected between T0 and T1. Presurgical cPLI and lipase activity were frequently increased during gastric dilatation-volvulus and were suggestive of the presence of pancreatic damage; while more extensive studies are required, based on this pilot analysis, cPLI has the potential to be a useful predictive variable for outcome in GDV. Further to this, serum CRP was able to predict outcome in this population of dogs with GDV, while blood lactate was not."
https://openalex.org/W2892228037,"In this study, we aimed to determine whether seasonality affects the content, chemical composition, and antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EOs) from the leaves of three species of Nectandra (Nectandra megapotamica, Nectandra grandiflora, and Nectandra lanceolata) native to the Atlantic rainforest, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. In addition, we identified the compounds potentially related to the antimicrobial activity. Leaves were randomly collected in the middle of winter (August), spring (November), summer (February), and autumn (May). The influence of seasonality on the content and chemical composition of EOs from the Nectandra species was evident in this study. The EOs from N. lanceolata and N. grandiflora were characterized by similarities in the chemical composition and had a higher relative proportion of oxygenated sesquiterpenes. N. megapotamica presented a different chemical profile, with plenty of monoterpenic and sesquiterpenic hydrocarbons. Changes in the EO chemical profile because of seasonality were shown by the similarities between the EOs obtained in spring and autumn and the differences between the EOs obtained in summer and winter. The EO from the leaves of N. megapotamica harvested in winter and spring showed the highest control of the growth of Escherichia coli, and this antimicrobial action can be related to the monoterpenes α-pinene and β-pinene as well as myrcene and limonene. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the EO from the leaves of N. lanceolata harvested in summer and autumn was lower against the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and can be related to the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons isobicyclogermacrenal, epi-zizanone, and germacrene B."
https://openalex.org/W2889974863,"As the basic carrier of air flight operation, air route network (ARN) is of great significance to the smooth operation of flights. However, the waypoint is a core part of the route, so it is an important topic to identify influential waypoints in ARN. In this paper, a method to identify the influence of the node in ARN based on an improved entropy weight (IEW) method is proposed. Then, centrality measures including degree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector as the multi-attribute of ARN in IEW application. IEW method is used to aggregate the multi-attribute to obtain the evaluation of the influence of each waypoint. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the IEW method, three real ARNs are selected to conduct several experiments with susceptible infected recovered (SIR) model. The results show the efficiency and practicability of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W2889708113,"Deaths due to hypertension in the US are highest among African Americans, who have a higher prevalence of hypertension and more severe hypertensive symptoms. Research indicates that there are both genetic and sociocultural risk factors for hypertension. Racial disparities in hypertension also likely involve genetic and sociocultural factors, but the factors may interact and manifest differently across racial groups. Here we use a biocultural approach to integrate genetic and social network data to better understand variation in blood pressure. We assay genetic variation at the angiotensin I converting enzyme gene (ACE) and analyze social network composition and structure in African Americans living in Tallahassee, FL (n = 138). We demonstrate that models including both genetic and social network data explain significantly more variation in blood pressure and have better model diagnostics than do models including only one datatype. Specifically, optimal models for systolic and diastolic blood pressure explain a notable 35% and 21%, respectively, of blood pressure variation. Analysis of the social networks reveals that individuals whose networks are dominated by family connections and are more fragmented have higher blood pressure. Historically, family support has been associated with better mental and physical health, but our results suggest that those family connections can also take a toll on health. These findings raise compelling questions regarding the roles of genetics, family, and social environment in hypertension in the African American community and suggest that interactions among these factors may help explain racial disparities in hypertension more accurately than any of the factors alone."
https://openalex.org/W2890641648,"Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) and brucellosis are major endemic zoonoses in ruminants in Morocco that impact on both animal and human health. This study presents an assessment of the epidemiological and socioeconomic burden of bacterial zoonoses in Sidi Kacem Province in Northern Morocco from a cross-sectional survey of 125 cattle and/or small ruminant-owning households. In total, 1082 sheep and goats were examined from 81 households. The single intradermal comparative cervical test to screen for bovine tuberculosis was undertaken on 1194 cattle from 123 households and all cattle were blood sampled. Cattle and small ruminant sera were tested for brucellosis using the standard Rose Bengal Test (sRBT) and the modified Rose Bengal Test (mRBT). Bacteriology was performed on 21 milk samples obtained from cattle that were seropositive for brucellosis for isolation and phenotyping of circulating Brucella strains. Individual and herd prevalence for BTB in cattle of 20.4% (95% CI 18%-23%) and 57.7% (95% CI 48%-66%), respectively, were observed in this study. The prevalence of brucellosis in cattle at individual and herd level was 1.9% (95% CI 1.2%-2.8%) and 9% (95% CI 4.5%-1.5%), respectively. Brucella pathogens were isolated from three cattle milk samples and were identified as B. abortus using Bruceladder® multiplex PCR and B. abortus biovar 1 by classical phenotyping. All small ruminants were seronegative to sRBT, two were positive to mRBT. A higher risk of BTB and brucellosis was observed in cattle in intensive livestock systems, in imported and crossed breeds and in animals from larger herds (>15). The three risk factors were usually present in the same herds, leading to higher transmission risk and persistence of both zoonoses. These results highlight the importance of implementing control strategies for both BTB and brucellosis to reduce productivity losses and the risk of transmission to humans. Prioritising control for BTB and brucellosis in intensive livestock production systems is essential for human and animal health."
https://openalex.org/W2892060403,"Mucopolysaccharide diseases are a group of lysosomal storage disorders caused by deficiencies of hydrolase enzymes, leading to pathological glycosaminoglycan accumulation. A number of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) types are characterised by severe airway disease, the aetiology of which is poorly understood. There is ongoing evidence of significant clinical disease in the long-term despite disease modifying therapeutic strategies, including enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT). To provide a better understanding of this aspect of disease, we have characterised extracellular matrix (ECM) and inflammatory alterations in adenotonsillar tissue samples from 8 MPS patients.Adenotonsillar samples from MPS I, IVA and VI ERT treated patients and from a single enzyme naïve MPS IIIA individual were compared to non-affected control samples using quantitative immunohistochemistry, qPCR and biochemical analysis.Significantly increased lysosomal compartment size and total sulphated glycosaminoglycan (p = 0.0007, 0.02) were identified in patient samples despite ERT. Heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan was significantly elevated in MPS I and IIIA (p = 0.002), confirming incomplete reversal of disease. Collagen IV and laminin α-5 (p = 0.002, 0.0004) staining demonstrated increased ECM deposition within the reticular and capillary network of MPS samples. No significant change in the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-6 or TNF-α was seen compared to control.This study suggests a role for ECM remodelling contributing to the obstructive phenotype of airway disease in MPS. Current therapeutic strategies with ERT fail to normalise these pathological alterations within adenotonsillar samples. Our findings lend novel insight into the pathological cascade of events, with primarily structural rather than inflammatory changes contributing to the continuing phenotype seen in patients despite current therapeutic regimes."

However, the insulin effect on PDH function has not been well established. We observed that insulin attenuated the phosphorylation (p) of Ser264 (p-Ser264) in the PDH Elα subunit (PDHA1) in normal rat hepatocyte. In contrast, insulin induced an increase of p-Ser264 PDHA1 levels in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and Huh7 cells. Insulin activated RhoA and Rho-dependent coiled coil kinase, an effector protein of active RhoA, which regulated p-Ser264 PDHA1 levels, along with both p-Ser9 and p-Tyr216 forms of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in HepG2 cells. Only p-Tyr216 GSK-3β, the active form was involved in an increase of p-Ser264 PDHA1. Akt was also engaged in p-Ser9 of GSK-3β, but neither in p-Tyr216 of GSK-3β nor p-Ser264 of PDHA1 upon insulin. Reconstituted dephospho-mimic forms PDHA1 S264A and GSK-3β Y216F impaired, but wild-types PDHA1 and GSK-3β and phospho-mimic forms PDHA1 S264D and GSK-3β Y216E increased cell proliferation upon insulin through expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1. Therefore, we propose that insulin-mediated p-PDHA1 is involved in the regulation of HepG2 cell proliferation through RhoA signaling pathway.—Islam, R., Kim, J.-G., Park, Y., Cho, J.-Y., Cap, K.-C., Kho, A.-R., Chung, W.-S., Suh, S.-W., Park, J.-B.

However, underlying relationship between statin and CAC is still unclear. This study explored the mediating role of five statin-related biochemical factors [i.e., low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels]. Seoul Metabolic Syndrome cohort study includes 1370 participants suspected of metabolic syndrome. For causal mediation analysis, the dataset for 2016 including 847 participants with coronary computed tomography without any missing value were analysed using the Mediation package in R software. This study identified a causal mediation mechanism of HDL-cholesterol among the five biochemical factors. It implied that statin treatment increases the HDL-cholesterol level, leading to decreasing the probability of CAC score > 0. Estimated values of interest in HDL-cholesterol mediation were (1) average causal mediation effect, -0.011 with 95% CI [-0.025, -0.003], (2) average direct effect, 0.143 with 95% CI [0.074, 0.219], and total effect, 0.132 with 95% CI [0.063, 0.209]. Its mediation effect was maintained regardless of statin intensity. Sensitivity analysis also provided a robustness of the results under potential existence of a confounder between HDL-cholesterol and CAC. This study suggests a potential causal pathway between statin and CAC (the positive association of statin on CAC) through HDL-cholesterol as an inhibitor."

OGT thereby stably glycosylates serines and threonines of numerous proteins and, via a transient glutamate glycosylation, cleaves a single known substrate—the so-called HCF-1PRO repeat of the transcriptional co-regulator host-cell factor 1 (HCF-1). Here, we probed the relationship between these distinct glycosylation and proteolytic activities. For proteolysis, the HCF-1PRO repeat possesses an important extended threonine-rich region that is tightly bound by the OGT tetratricopeptide-repeat (TPR) region. We report that linkage of this HCF-1PRO-repeat, threonine-rich region to heterologous substrate sequences also potentiates robust serine glycosylation with the otherwise poor Rp-αS-UDP-GlcNAc diastereomer phosphorothioate and UDP-5S-GlcNAc OGT co-substrates.

Using serine- or glutamate-containing HCF-1PRO-repeat sequences, we show that proposed OGT-based or UDP-GlcNAc–based serine-acceptor residue activation mechanisms can be circumvented independently, but not when disrupted together.

Thus, the HCF-1PRO repeat appears to be a very specific OGT cleavage substrate because it is able to induce OGT to O-GlcNAcylate the Glu-10 residue. Indeed, the HCF-1PRO repeat interacts intimately with OGT across much of its length, favorably positioning the Glu-10 residue adjacent to the UDP-GlcNAc for glycosylation (2Lazarus M.B. Jiang J.

Here, we examine the glycosylation and cleavage activities of OGT on HCF-1PRO repeat–related and –nonrelated substrates and find that position 10 of the HCF-1PRO repeat confers special enzymatic OGT glycosylation properties on substrates leading to different outcomes: canonical serine glycosylation or noncanonical glutamate-induced proteolysis. To study the canonical serine and threonine glycosylation and noncanonical glycosyl glutamate–induced cleavage activities of OGT, we used human casein kinase 2 (CK2) and HCF-1PRO-repeat substrates, respectively, using both native and recombinant proteins as well as synthetic peptides. Protein substrates were used for immunoblot analysis with both GlcNAc and protein substrate–specific antibodies, whereas peptides were used for MS analysis.

To verify the precise status of E10S peptide glycosylation, we performed electron transfer dissociation analysis of the Rp-αS-UDP-GlcNAc E10S peptide product. As shown in Fig. 2D, the product is uniquely glycosylated at the E10S position. Thus, the E10S peptide relaxes the molecular constraints on UDP-GlcNAc–related co-substrates for OGT glycosyltransferase activity. To identify the properties of the E10S peptide responsible for its unusual relaxed UDP-GlcNAc co-substrate requirements, we compared the co-substrate requirements of the CK2 and E10S peptides by preparing two chimeric (Ch) peptides. As shown in Fig. 1B, the HCF-1PRO repeat has been divided into three regions: cleavage (PPCE) and threonine-rich (TGTTNTATTAT) regions held together by a flexible three amino acid (THE) linker segment (9Kapuria V. Röhrig U.F. Bhuiyan T. Borodkin V.S. van Aalten D.M. Zoete V. Herr W. Proteolysis of HCF-1 by Ser/Thr glycosylation-incompetent O-GlcNAc transferase:UDP-GlcNAc complexes.Genes Dev. 2016; 30 (27056667): 960-97210.1101/gad.275925.115Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the OGT-bound WT HCF-1PRO-repeat substrate, the Glu-10–containing cleavage region lies beside the UDP-GlcNAc co-substrate in the OGT catalytic domain, and the threonine-rich region binds the TPR domain anchoring the HCF-1PRO repeat in OGT (2Lazarus M.B. Jiang J. Kapuria V. Bhuiyan T. Janetzko J. Zandberg W.F. Vocadlo D.J. Herr W. Walker S. HCF-1 is cleaved in the active site of O-GlcNAc transferase.Science. 2013; 342 (24311690): 1235-123910.1126/science.1243990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the E10S HCF-1PRO-repeat substrate, the WT HCF-1PRO-repeat cleavage region is converted into a “glycosylation region.” As shown in Fig. 3A, the first chimeric peptide, called Ch10, replaced the N-terminal E10S HCF-1PRO-repeat glycosylation region (residues 1–10) with the corresponding CK2 peptide sequence (residues 1–12). The second, called Ch13, replaced both the glycosylation region and the THE linker (residues 1–13) with the corresponding CK2 peptide sequence (residues 1–15). These two chimeric peptides displayed co-substrate glycosylation selectivity similar to the HCF-1PRO-repeat E10S peptide, being also readily active with the Rp-αS-UDP-GlcNAc co-substrate. Thus, neither the E10S HCF-1PRO-repeat glycosylation region nor the THE linker is essential for its relaxed co-substrate requirements. These results led us to focus on the importance of the threonine-rich region, for which we created three Ch13 peptide–based mutants, called Ch13-T14A, Ch13-T14Y and Ch13-T(17–22)A. In Ch13-T14A and Ch13-T14Y, we replaced position Thr-14, the first residue of the threonine-rich region (see Fig. 3A) and a residue critical for HCF-1PRO-repeat cleavage (11Bhuiyan T. Waridel P. Kapuria V. Zoete V. Herr W. Distinct OGT-binding sites promote HCF-1 cleavage.PLoS One. 2015; 10 (26305326)e013663610.1371/journal.pone.0136636Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), either conservatively with alanine (Ch13-T14A) or radically with tyrosine (Ch13-T14Y). In Ch13-T(17–22)A, we replaced four conserved threonine residues with alanine, a mutation that severely disrupts OGT binding to the HCF-1PRO repeat (1Capotosti F. Guernier S. Lammers F. Waridel P. Cai Y. Jin J. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Herr W. O-GlcNAc transferase catalyzes site-specific proteolysis of HCF-1.Cell. 2011; 144 (21295698): 376-38810.1016/j.cell.2010.12.030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Fig. 3C shows the results of peptide glycosylation assays with UDP-GlcNAc and the Sp- and Rp-αS-UDP-GlcNAc diastereomers and these three threonine-rich region mutants. For each peptide, the results are normalized to the activity of UDP-GlcNAc for that peptide (see the legend to Fig. 3). The Ch13 parental and Ch13-T14A and Ch13-T14Y mutant peptides displayed similar activities with UDP-GlcNAc, whereas the radical threonine-region Ch13-T(17–22)A mutant was more than 10-fold less active. These results suggest that for normal UDP-GlcNAc–induced glycosylation, the threonine region is important because the Ch13-T(17–22)A mutant displays little activity and yet is not easily inactivated, as the Ch13-T14A and Ch13-T14Y mutants remain active in these assays. Indeed, the Ch13-T(17–22)A mutant showed activities similar to the CK2 peptide: low overall UDP-GlcNAc utilization and strong selectivity against the Rp-αS-UDP-GlcNAc diastereomer (compare Fig. 2B with Fig. 3C). In contrast, the Ch13-T14A and Ch13-T14Y mutants have high UDP-GlcNAc utilization and yet curiously display increasing discrimination between the two Sp- and Rp-αS-UDP-GlcNAc diastereomers, whereas the Rp-αS-UDP-GlcNAc diastereomer displays little if any activity with the Ch13-T14Y mutant chimeric peptide. Thus, the juxtaposition of the HCF-1PRO-repeat threonine-rich region to the CK2 glycosylation site in the Ch13 chimeric peptide has two distinct and separable effects on CK2 sequence glycosylation: (i) it stimulates glycosylation and (ii) relaxes the constraints on the use of the Rp-αS-UDP-GlcNAc co-substrate for OGT serine glycosylation. The aforementioned studies reveal a striking difference in activity of the CK2 and HCF-1PRO-repeat E10S substrates and that the CK2 substrate can be converted to an HCF-1PRO-repeat E10S-like substrate by fusion to the HCF-1PRO-repeat threonine-rich region. Given this unusual activity spectrum, we turned to computational methods to investigate how these different substrates might interact with OGT and UDP-GlcNAc. As shown in Fig. 4C, we generated an initial structure of the chimeric Ch13 peptide sequence by homology modeling, using the X-ray diffraction–determined structures of the parental HCF-1PRO repeat and CK2 (Fig. 4, A and B) (2Lazarus M.B. Jiang J. Kapuria V. Bhuiyan T. Janetzko J. Zandberg W.F. Vocadlo D.J. Herr W. Walker S. HCF-1 is cleaved in the active site of O-GlcNAc transferase.Science. 2013; 342 (24311690): 1235-123910.1126/science.1243990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as templates. This approach yielded an OGT-bound Ch13 peptide structure very similar to the CK2 crystal structure of Lazarus et al. (12Lazarus M.B. Jiang J. Gloster T.M. Zandberg W.F. Whitworth G.E. Vocadlo D.J. Walker S. Structural snapshots of the reaction coordinate for O-GlcNAc transferase.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8 (23103939): 966-96810.1038/nchembio.1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B) in the N terminus up to the serine-acceptor residue (root mean square deviation (RMSD) = 1.25 Å) and a structure similar to the WT HCF-1PRO-repeat peptide in the threonine-rich region (RMSD = 0.90 Å). The SAN linker region of the CK2 sequence adopts a conformation close to the linker region of the HCF-1PRO repeat. To test the relevance of the modeled OGT-bound chimeric Ch13 peptide structure and to compare the molecular properties of the three OGT-bound peptides, we turned to molecular dynamic simulations as shown in Fig. 4 (D–F). Fig. 4D shows the relative movements of the TPR and catalytic domains as well as of UDP-GlcNAc and of the peptide glycosylation region (−3 to +2 of the serine acceptor at position 0) with respect to the OGT catalytic domain X-ray structure. As expected, we observed little relative movement of the catalytic domain and UDP-GlcNAc moieties when bound to five different peptide substrates: CK2, HCF-1PRO-rep 2 WT (Glu-10) and E10S mutant, and chimeric Ch13 and Ch13-T14Y peptides. As described previously (10Lazarus M.B. Nam Y. Jiang J. Sliz P. Walker S. Structure of human O-GlcNAc transferase and its complex with a peptide substrate.Nature. 2011; 469 (21240259): 564-56710.1038/nature09638Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), we observed significant TPR-domain movements relative to the catalytic domain (Fig. 4D). However, relative TPR-domain movements of OGT bound to the two HCF-1 and chimeric Ch13 peptides were more constrained than those of the CK2 peptide. These results suggest that peptides binding to both the catalytic domain and the TPR domain restrict inter-TPR and catalytic domain movements. The mutant Ch13-T14Y peptide-bound OGT displayed less constrained inter-TPR and catalytic domain movements, similar to the CK2-bound OGT. These latter results are consistent with an unstable TPR-Ch13-T14Y interaction observed in the molecular dynamic simulations (data not shown) and the aforementioned similar pattern of glycosylation between the Ch13-T14Y and CK2 peptides (Figure 2, Figure 3). Fig. 4 (E and F) shows the relative movement of individual backbone positions from 7 to 14 of the HCF-1PRO-repeat peptides (position 10 being the glycosylation or cleavage position) relative to the catalytic (E) and TPR (F) domains. The three HCF-1 threonine-rich region–containing peptides behaved nearly identically—relative to the catalytic domain, there was little change in motion across the eight residues (Fig. 4E). Relative to the TPR domain, residues 7–10 exhibited more motion than residues 11–14, which are closer to the TPR domain (Fig. 4F). In contrast, the CK2 peptide residues displayed a bipartite pattern relative to the catalytic domain, with the glycosylation region residues 7–11 moving considerably less than the C-terminal residues 12–14 (Fig. 4E), which are not anchored to OGT via the TPR domain by the threonine-rich region. The same decoupling of the CK2 peptide movements from the TPR movements can be observed in Fig. 4F. These results are consistent with the HCF-1PRO-repeat threonine-rich region serving to anchor peptides to OGT; such anchoring could explain the relaxed co-substrate requirements of the HCF-1PRO-repeat threonine-rich region–containing peptides. To probe further the effects of the threonine-rich region on UDP-GlcNAc co-substrate requirements, we tested the glycosylation substrate activities of the various peptides with the previously described 5S-GlcNAc thio-derivative of UDP-GlcNAc, a potent inhibitor of OGT glycosylation (6Gloster T.M. Zandberg W.F. Heinonen J.E. Shen D.L. Deng L. Vocadlo D.J. Hijacking a biosynthetic pathway yields a glycosyltransferase inhibitor within cells.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7 (21258330): 174-18110.1038/nchembio.520Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we compared by LC-MS the levels of peptide glycosylation using the UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-5S-GlcNAc co-substrates. Owing to the molecular differences (hydrophobicity and molecular weight) of GlcNAc and 5S-GlcNAc, the glycosylated peptides could be distinguished from one another in both the HPLC and MS steps of the analysis, respectively. As expected, the CK2 peptide was only glycosylated by the UDP-GlcNAc co-substrate (Fig. 5A; m/z 662.661, blue). In contrast, the HCF-1PRO-repeat E10S peptide was effectively glycosylated with both the UDP-GlcNAc (m/z 951.760, blue) and UDP-5S-GlcNAc (m/z 957.085, red) co-substrates (Fig. 5B). The fusion of the HCF-1PRO-repeat threonine-rich region to the CK2 glycosylation region in a Ch13 peptide setting robustly activated UDP-5S-GlcNAc modification of the CK2 sequence (Fig. 5C, compare GlcNAc m/z 982.483 (blue) and 5S-GlcNAc m/z 987.809 (red)), which depended on the conserved threonine-rich region (Fig. 5D, m/z 942.469, blue). Thus, as for the Rp-αS-UDP-GlcNAc diastereomer, the HCF-1PRO-repeat threonine-rich region relaxes the constraints on UDP-5S-GlcNAc co-substrate utilization. The interaction of OGT with the HCF-1PRO repeat was first elucidated in the context of its unexpected role in cleavage of HCF-1 (1Capotosti F. Guernier S. Lammers F. Waridel P. Cai Y. Jin J. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Herr W. O-GlcNAc transferase catalyzes site-specific proteolysis of HCF-1.Cell. 2011; 144 (21295698): 376-38810.1016/j.cell.2010.12.030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that the HCF-1PRO repeat and in particular its threonine-rich region can activate unexpected enzymatic OGT glycosylation activities in CK2-HCF-1PRO-repeat chimeras. In so doing, we observed, as shown in Fig. 4C, that the structure of the CK2 glycosylation sequence in the Ch13 chimera can adopt a very similar backbone structure to the corresponding cleavage site and surrounding sequences of the OGT-bound HCF-1PRO repeat. This led us to ask whether simple replacement of the glycosylated CK2 serine residue by a glutamate (i.e. S10E) might be sufficient to activate cleavage of this non-HCF-1 sequence. To answer this question, we first mutated the three-HCF-1PRO repeat–containing HCF3R cleavage substrate into a single-cleavage-site substrate by inactivating HCF-1PRO repeats 1 and 3, creating HCF3R-AEA (see Table S2 for sequences). We then converted positions 3–13 of the central HCF-1PRO repeat 2 into the corresponding CK2 glycosylation site sequence—creating a robust glycosylation substrate (called HCF3R-A(CK2-S)A), as shown in Fig. S2—followed by mutation of the single CK2 serine glycosylation acceptor into a glutamate residue, thus creating HCF3R-A(CK2-E)A. Fig. 6 shows the results of a cleavage assay with the HCF3R-AEA and HCF3R-A(CK2-E)A substrates. As expected, the WT HCF-1PRO repeat in HCF3R-AEA was effectively cleaved by WT OGT (compare lanes 1 and 2) but not the inactive mutant K842M (lane 4) (2Lazarus M.B. Jiang J. Kapuria V. Bhuiyan T.

A previously described glycosylation-defective but proteolysis-competent “Swap” mutant (D554H/H558D) (9Kapuria V. Röhrig U.F. Bhuiyan T. Borodkin V.S. van Aalten D.M. Zoete V. Herr W.

The HCF3R-A(CK2-E)A substrate was also effectively cleaved (compare lanes 5–8), showing that OGT can cleave a substrate containing a glutamate residue at the right position (position 10) in a non-HCF-1 sequence context. The elevated cleavage activity observed with the OGT Swap mutant, in which residue Asp-554 is mutated, is consistent with the results of Janetzko et al. (3Janetzko J. Trauger S.A. Lazarus M.B. Walker S. How the glycosyltransferase OGT catalyzes amide bond cleavage.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12 (27618188): 899-90110.1038/nchembio.2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the aforementioned experiments, only two prominent elements of the HCF-1PRO repeat remained in the OGT proteolysis substrate: the glutamate cleavage-site residue at position 10 and the threonine-rich region. To address the importance of these two HCF-1PRO-repeat sequence elements for cleavage, we turned to the peptide and LC-MS–based cleavage assay recently described by Janetzko et al. (3Janetzko J.

https://openalex.org/W2890583804,"Background People with HIV infection in the United States are often affected by chronic viral hepatitis. These coinfected people with either HBV or HCV are at increased risk for serious, life-threatening complications. Coinfections with viral hepatitis may also complicate the delivery of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) by escalating the risk of drug-related hepatoxicity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 10 percent of people with HIV in the United States also have HBV, and 25 percent also have HCV coinfection. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the increased life-expectancy of HIV patients, clinicians are more likely to be confronted with issues related to co-infection and the management challenges that they present, especially in resource-limited settings. The purpose of this analysis was to identify geographical clusters of HIV- (HBV/HCV) co-infection and compared to the geographical clusters of not co-infected using DC, Department of Health surveillance data. The results of the analysis will be used to target resources to areas at risk. Methods HIV and Hepatitis surveillance data were matched among cases diagnosed between 1980 and 2016. HIV-hepatitis co-infected and the not co-infected spatial clusters were detected using discrete Poisson model. Kulldorff’s spatial scan statistic method was implemented in the free software tool called SaTScan which has been widely adopted for detecting disease cluster. The analysis was conducted by tracts, but for visualization, ease of interpretation and assist in policy making the tract map was overlaid with the ward map using ArcGIS 10.5.1. Results Between 1980 and 2016, there were 12,965 diagnosed cases of HIV, of which 2,316 HIV/Hepatitis matches were identified. Of the 2316 co-infected people living in DC, 25 percent (N = 590) of people had HBV, and 75 percent (N = 1,726) had HCV. Out of 12,965 diagnosed cases, remaining 10,649 did not have any co-infections (not co-infected). IDU (27.16 percent) and MSM (32.86 percent) were the highest mode of transmission for co-infected population. African-American were reported 83.64 percent (N = 1,937) among co-infection population. Three clusters were identified for both co-infected population in DC. The largest cluster radius for co-infected analysis covers wards 6, 7 and 8 as well as large parts of 2 and 5 (p < 0.001). Multiple clusters were identified for not co-infected population (p < 0.001). IDU (n = 450) was the highest mode of transmission for the co-infected clusters. For all clusters combined of not co-infected population highest mode of transmission were MSM (n = 2,534). This analysis also showed racial disparity, economic deprivation and lack of education were prominent in the co-infected clusters. Conclusion We identified locations of high risk clusters where enhanced hepatitis and HIV prevention, treatment, and care can help combat the epidemic. The clusters radius expands into the neighboring state of Maryland as well. The findings from this analysis will be used to target area based public health policy and healthcare interventions for HIV-hepatitis. It is recommended based on the analysis that needle exchange programs can successfully control new HIV infections as well as hepatitis co-infections."

The population genetics and historical biogeography of this plant have remained relatively unexplored. This study explores phylogeny, population genetics and ancestral reconstructions adopting multi locus sequence typing (MLST) approach. MLST sequences dataset was generated from genomics and chloroplast DNA sequences obtained from 31 T. officinale haplotypes located in 16 different countries. Phylogenetic analysis distributed these haplotypes in well differentiated geographic clades. The study suggested a close relationship between Europe and adjacent Asian countries. Populations of these regions predominantly formed common haplogroups, showed considerable level of gene flow and evidence for recombination events across European and Asian population. Biogeographical inferences obtained by applying statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis (S-DIVA) and Bayesian binary MCMC (BBM) analysis showed that T. officinale was putatively originated in Europe. Molecular clock analysis based on ITS dataset suggested that the divergence between Europe and East Asian populations can be dated to 1.07 Mya with subsequent dispersal and vicariance events. Among different spatial process long distance seed dispersal mediated by wind had potentially assisted the population expansion of T. officinale."

We developed a computational model that incorporates cell heterogeneity in order to investigate Jurkat T cell response to time dependent extracellular IL-2 stimulation. Our model predicted preferred timing of IL-2 oscillatory input for maximizing downstream intracellular STAT5 nuclear translocation. The modeled cytokine exposure was replicated experimentally through the use of a microfluidic platform that enabled the parallelized capture of dynamic single cell response to precisely delivered pulses of IL-2 stimulus. The in vitro results demonstrate that single cell response profiles vary with pulsatile IL-2 input at pre-equilibrium levels. These observations confirmed our model predictions that Jurkat cells have a preferred range of extracellular IL-2 fluctuations, in which downstream response is rapidly initiated. Further investigation into this filtering behavior could increase our understanding of how pre-existing cellular states within immune cell populations enable a systems response within a preferred range of ligand fluctuations, and whether the observed cytokine range corresponds to in vivo conditions."
