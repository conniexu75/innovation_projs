https://openalex.org/W1978505523,"Information was collected on 90 mummified carcasses of the ""crabeater"" seal in the ice-free areas of the McMurdo Sound region, Antarctica. The carcasses range from relatively well-preserved bodies to merely old, twisted, winddissected fragments of tissue. They are hard and dry and lie on the surface of the ground, mostly in valley bottoms. The arid, cold climate is ideal for retarding organic decay. One carcass was dated by radiocarbon analysis and found to be between 1600 and 2600 years old."
https://openalex.org/W2102796306,"production by rat adrenal tissue, in vitro, in the presence of triphosphopyridine nucleotide and glucose 6-phosphate is stimulated by freezing, by Ca++, and by ficin. Various properties of the stimulation resulting from these conditions have been described and it has been suggested that a common locus was involved (2). The experiments reported in this paper were designed to localize the stimulated system. It has been found that the system stimulated is present in the large particles of the rat adrenal cell and that, in the sequence of reactions leading to the synthesis of corticosteroids from endogenous precursor, the stimulated step(s) appears to be concerned with the transformation of cholesterol to pregnenolone."

The factor was estimated by a technique1 based on the thromboplastin generation test and results were expressed as a percentage of the concentration in a standard normal plasma. The lower histogram in Fig. 1 shows the plasma concentrations in 86 healthy white adults adjusted to the nearest 10 per cent. The values are skewed with a fairly sharply defined lower limit and range from 60 to 200 per cent of standard normal. This group comprised equal numbers of males and females, and there was no significant sex difference in the values. These normal results are very similar to those found in a previous group of 80 normal white adults reported on from this laboratory2."

https://openalex.org/W1972696766,"The basic proteins protamine (sulfate), histone, lysozyme, and ribonuclease were found to be potent inhibitors of mammalian heart muscle cytochromec oxidase. Their inhibitions were completely reversed in the presence of a strongly anionic polyglucose sulfate. With fresh rat heart muscle homogenates, Keili and Hartree type of beef heart muscle particulates, and deoxycholate-solubilized oxidase preparations, the reversible nature of the phenomenon was demonstrated with manometric and spectrophotometric assays for cytochrome c oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1964415057,"THE corpuscles of Stannius, supposedly endocrine glands, are peculiar to teleostean fishes. Their function is uncertain1, but Rasquin2 has suggested that they are concerned in osmoregulation. Unequivocal evidence that the interrenal tissue of teleosts is the homologue of the adrenal cortex3,4 strongly suggests that a role other than production of corticosteroids be attributed to the corpuscles of Stannius. In order to supply direct evidence to support this assumption, procedures used in studies on interrenal tissue of Fundulus heteroclitus 4 were applied to corpuscles of Stannius collected from Pseudo-pleuronectes americanus. Sixty-one fish, caught in Niantic Bay and Long Island Sound, Conn., in December 1958 yielded 95 corpuscles of Stannius weighing 104.7 mgm. This tissue and 162 mgm. of mesonephric kidney which served as control tissue, were separately incubated with tritiated progesterone in a manner previously described4."

https://openalex.org/W1977226125,"LITTLE is known about the factors which influence cartilaginous and bony metaplasia in tumours apart from the presence of calcified debris and mucinous infiltration in the stroma of these tumours. Willis1 discusses the association of frequent bony metaplasia in carcinomas of the large intestine, and suggests that this may be associated with the alkaline phosphatase content of these tumours. He furthermore suggests that studies of phosphatases and other enzymes should be undertaken in tumours which show a tendency to bony metaplasia. The presence of an alkaline phosphatase in the ‘fibroblasts’ of fibrous dysplasia2,3 and in the so-called fibrocytes of ossifying fibromas3 certainly lends support to the ossifying properties of this enzyme in certain tumours."

The ‘final activity’ and the ‘induction rate’—the slope within the linear range of the activity curve in Fig. 1—are characteristic for this strain and enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2087213137,"The construction of a modified Hartley oscillator transmitter activated through a pressure switch is described. When this device is placed within the rumen of a cow which is allowed unrestricted movement in the pasture, frequency-modulation signals are transmitted to a recording receiver whenever a preselected pressure is exceeded. The pressure at which transmission begins is determined by the capacitance across the coil of the circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2083051367,"VARIOUS studies have suggested that the excretion of β-amino-isobutyric acid in human urine is under genetic control1–4. This amino-acid is derived from the metabolism of thymine via dihydrothymine and β-ureido-isobutyric acid5. Variation in excretion of β-amino-isobutyric acid may be controlled by a single gene pair, with high excretors being homozygous for a single recessive gene and low excretors being either heterozygous or homozygous for the dominant allele6. It also has been suggested that low and high excretors may differ in their metabolism of β-amino-isobutyric acid7. An increased incidence of high excretors has been found in certain ethnic groups, notably the Athabascan and Apache Indians of North America, the Black Caribs of British Honduras, and the Chinese and Japanese4,6,8. High excretors of β-amino-isobutyric acid are relatively uncommon in populations of Caucasian origin1,2,3."

https://openalex.org/W2090240750,LABELLED adenine1 and thymidine labelled with tritium2 are incorporated into the deoxyribonucleic acid of the epithelial cells of the seminal vesicle of adult mice at a rate equivalent to a renewal of approximately 10 per cent of the deoxyribonucleic acid per day. Comparison of counts of cells in division and labelled nuclei in autoradiographs of the seminal vesicle and œsophagus2 show that this renewal of deoxyribonucleic acid is approximately 45 times in excess of requirements for cell-proliferation. It seemed of interest to explore whether this incorporation of thymidine is influenced by the sexual activity of the animals.

https://openalex.org/W2010115868,Evidence of facilitation of response has been found in psychometrically determined critical fusion frequencies to flicker at low contrast. Spatial summation is denied by the distribution form of the data. Temporal summation within a determined time limit is supported. This may be mediated through association cells at the bipolar-ganglion synapse.

https://openalex.org/W2058043959,"RECENT observations that methylpentynol, a sedative-hypnotic agent, interferes with transmission in certain cholinergic synapses1, have led to the demonstration by Marley and Paton that this action is due in part to a reduction in the output of acetylcholine, at least from the superior cervical ganglion of the cat2. In the course of work in this and other laboratories on the influence of a number of appropriate neuro-pharmacological agents on the acetylcholine content of the rat's brain, it became apparent that the administration of depressants of the central nervous system in general is followed by a rise in brain acetylcholine (unpublished work and ref. 3). It seemed essential, therefore, for us to include methylpentynol in our survey, because this central-depressant might, in the light of the findings of Marley and Paton, depress the output of acetylcholine by the brain, possibly leading to a depression of the total level of acetylcholine. On the other hand, if release of acetylcholine alone, and not its synthesis, were interfered with, one might expect an accumulation and an increase in the amount of acetylcholine in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2046460803,"ASYMMETRY of the abdominal segments in the corixid males is a regular occurrence with the sense of asymmetry, dextral or sinistral, regularly uniform intraspecifically. One finds among the males no intermediate forms, for all the asymmetrical structures of a dextral male are perfect mirror-images of those in a sinistral male and vice versa. More particularly, the sex-limited structures are confined to the body wall, and more precisely, to the last six segments where the exoskeleton and musculature display an asymmetrical pattern, emphasized by an oval black body (the strigil) and a curved genital capsule. In the dextral male the strigil is limited to the right margin of the sixth segment and the genital capsule is directed to the right. These asymmetrical structures are, of course, mirror-images of those in a sinistral male, while in the females bilateral symmetry prevails. Instances of situs inversus
1 are rare."
