https://openalex.org/W3195362838,"Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, as a result of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has been the direct cause of over 2.2 million deaths worldwide. A timely coordinated host-immune response represents the leading driver for restraining SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, several studies have described dysregulated immunity as the crucial determinant for critical illness and the failure of viral control. Improved understanding and management of COVID-19 could greatly reduce the mortality and morbidity caused by SARS-CoV-2. One aspect of the immune response that has to date been understudied is whether lipid mediator production is dysregulated in critically ill patients. In the present study, plasma from COVID-19 patients with either severe disease and those that were critically ill was collected and lipid mediator profiles were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results from these studies indicated that plasma concentrations of both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediator were reduced in critically ill patients when compared with those with severe disease. Furthermore, plasma concentrations of a select group of mediators that included the specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) Resolvin (Rv) D1 and RvE4 were diagnostic of disease severity. Interestingly, peripheral blood SPM concentrations were also linked with outcome in critically ill patients, where we observed reduced overall concentrations of these mediators in those patients that did not survive. Together the present findings establish a link between plasma lipid mediators and disease severity in patients with COVID-19 and indicate that plasma SPM concentrations may be linked with survival in these patients."

We present data on self-rated health three to eight months after laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease compared to a control group of SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. We followed a cohort of 8786 non-hospitalized patients who were invited after SARS-CoV-2 testing between February 1 and April 15, 2020 (794 positive, 7229 negative). Participants answered online surveys at baseline and follow-up including questions on demographics, symptoms, risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, and self-rated health compared to one year ago. Determinants for a worsening of self-rated health as compared to one year ago among the SARS-CoV-2 positive group were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression and also compared to the population norm. The follow-up questionnaire was completed by 85% of the SARS-CoV-2 positive and 75% of the SARS-CoV-2 negative participants on average 132 days after the SARS-CoV-2 test. At follow-up, 36% of the SARS-CoV-2 positive participants rated their health “somewhat” or “much” worse than one year ago. In contrast, 18% of the SARS-CoV-2 negative participants reported a similar deterioration of health while the population norm is 12%. Sore throat and cough were more frequently reported by the control group at follow-up. Neither gender nor follow-up time was associated with the multivariate odds of worsening of self-reported health compared to one year ago. Age had an inverted-U formed association with a worsening of health while being fit and being a health professional were associated with lower multivariate odds. A significant proportion of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, regardless of age, have not returned to their usual health three to eight months after infection."
https://openalex.org/W3196010646,"When the Fun Stops , Stop , is a prominent ‘responsible gambling’ campaign in the UK, originally funded and delivered by the industry-initiated and funded Senet Group. Since the Senet Group’s dissolution in 2020, the campaign has been overseen by the Betting and Gambling Council (BGC), the main gambling industry trade body. There has been no prior analysis of the activities, ideas and framing adopted by the Senet Group, who claimed to be acting as an industry ‘watchdog’ and oversaw what they characterised as a major public education campaign. We collated written and image-based material related to the Senet Group and its When the Fun Stops , Stop campaign from multiple sources. Guided by Entman’s four functions of framing, we analysed the Senet Group’s framing of the issues it sought to address, particularly harmful gambling, as well as its causes, and the solutions, focusing on the group’s main activity: the delivery of the When the Fun Stops , Stop campaign. We also critically appraised an evaluation of the campaign funded by the Senet Group, using the findings to interrogate the stated claims about the campaign’s effectiveness. The analysis showed that the Senet Group’s framing of the problem, its causes, and proposed responses resemble those adopted by other industries and industry-funded groups. This involves portraying any harms caused by their products as limited to an atypical minority, rejecting upstream determinants of harm, and promoting individually-targeted voluntary measures, all contrary to the evidence of what works in health promotion, and what would characterise a public health approach. Neither the existing evidence base nor the evidence presented by the Senet Group support their claims about the campaign’s effectiveness. These findings add to concerns about industry-funded campaigns in other areas. To minimise conflicts of interest, interventions intended to address gambling-related harms, such as public education campaigns, should be evidence-based and developed, implemented and evaluated completely independent of the industry and industry-funded organisations."
https://openalex.org/W3195347646,"Despite the greater adverse economic impacts in low and middle-income (LAMI) compared to high-income countries, fewer studies have investigated the associations between COVID-19-related stressor and mental health in LAMI countries. The objectives of this study were to determine the associations between COVID-19-related stressors and anxiety and depressive symptoms while controlling for known risk and protective factors and to investigate any sex differences. An online survey was carried out to assess sociodemographic, psychosocial (previous mental health conditions, sexual orientation, intimate partner violence and perceived social support) and COVID-19-related variables. Hierarchical linear regression was carried out with anxiety and depressive symptoms as separate outcomes. Of the COVID-19-related factors, testing positive for COVID-19 infection, having COVID-19 symptoms, having other medical conditions, self-isolating due to COVID-19 symptoms, worry about infection, perception of the pandemic as a threat to income and isolation during the lockdown were significantly associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms. Of these, worry about infection, isolation during lockdown and disruption due to the pandemic retained independent associations with both outcomes. The variance in anxiety and depressive symptoms explained by COVID-19-related factors was larger in women (11.8%) compared to men (6.1% and 0.8% respectively). COVID-19-related stressors are associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms, with these effects being larger in men compared to women. Enhancing social support can be an affordable strategy to mitigate this risk but this needs to be investigated using appropriate designs."
https://openalex.org/W3193674837,"The lack of social contact or good social relationships has been linked with cognitive decline and higher risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. One important but unexamined question is how daily social interactions relate to older adults' cognitive function in daily life. The present study examined how changes in daily social interactions related to fluctuations in older adults' performance on mobile cognitive tests from day to day. Using an ecological momentary assessments approach, 312 older adults (aged 70 to 90 years) completed surveys on social interactions and mobile cognitive tests five times a day for 16 consecutive days using smartphones. Multilevel modeling was used for analyses. Results demonstrated that having more daily social interactions, especially more pleasant social interactions, related to better cognitive performance the same day and over the subsequent two days. Cognitive performance, however, did not predict subsequent changes in social interactions across days. At the between-person level, older adults who had more (vs. less) frequent interactions with close partners on average, especially with their friends, had better cognitive performance. Finally, the average levels of social interactions also moderated the within-person associations between daily social interactions and the same-day cognitive performance. In sum, results from this study highlight the importance of having pleasant social interactions and frequent interactions with friends for older adults' cognitive function in daily life, and have important implications for future behavioral interventions targeting certain features of daily social interactions to reduce risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias."
https://openalex.org/W3195199709,"Although numerous epidemiological studies revealed an association between ambient fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) exposure and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the PM 2.5 -induced neuron toxicity and associated mechanisms were not fully elucidated. The present study assessed brain toxicity in 6-month-old female triple-transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice following subchronic exposure to PM 2.5 via an inhalation system. The treated mice were whole-bodily and continuously exposed to real-world PM 2.5 for 3 months, while the control mice inhaled filtered air. Changes in cognitive and motor functions were evaluated using the Morris Water Maze and rotarod tests. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis was used to record gross brain volume alterations, and tissue staining with hematoxylin and eosin, Nissl, and immunohistochemistry methods were used to monitor pathological changes in microstructures after PM 2.5 exposure. The levels of AD-related hallmarks and the oxidative stress biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA) were assessed using Western blot analysis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Our results showed that subchronic exposure to environmental levels of PM 2.5 induced obvious neuronal loss in the cortex of exposed mice, but without significant impairment of cognitive and motor function. Increased levels of phosphorylated-tau and MDA were also observed in olfactory bulb or hippocampus after PM 2.5 exposure, but no amyloid pathology was detected, as reported in previous studies. These results revealed that a relatively lower level of PM 2.5 subchronic exposure from the environmental atmosphere still induced certain neurodegenerative changes in the brains of AD mice, especially in the olfactory bulb, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, which is consistent with the nasal entry and spreading route for PM exposure. Systemic factors may also contribute to the neuronal toxicity. The effects of PM 2.5 after a more prolonged exposure period are needed to establish a more comprehensive picture of the PM 2.5 -mediated development of AD."
https://openalex.org/W3194475863,"Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) has become a prevalent ocular surface disorder. Its pathogenesis is regarded as a self-perpetuating inflammatory vicious circle. Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) treatment was recently applied to improve the meibomian gland function and reduce symptoms of MGD. However, studies investigating the change of specific inflammatory cytokines during IPL treatment remained sparse. To further figure out how IPL treatment modulates the inflammatory cytokines in tears of MGD, we therefore performed a cross-sectional study and enrolled 32 patients from March 2019 to December 2020. The patients received 3 sessions of IPL treatment (10 to 16 J/cm2) at 4-week interval. The signs and symptoms of MGD were evaluated by ocular surface disease index (OSDI), tear film breakup time (TBUT), and meibomian gland yield secretion score (MGYSS). The clinical evaluators and tear samples were analyzed at baseline and at each IPL treatment session. Concentrations of (chemokine ligand) CXCL1, (C-C motif chemokine) CCL11, (tumor necrosis factor) TNF-α, (interferon) IFN-γ, (interleukin) IL-2, IL-6 and (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase) TIMP-1were measured by Quantibody Human Dry Eye Disease Array1. OSDI significantly decreased after IPL treatment compared with baseline. TBUT and MGYSS increased consecutively during treatment. CXCL1, CCL11, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6 presented significantly decrease and TIMP-1 showed significantly increase from the pretreatment baseline. The changed concentrations of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, TIMP-1 correlated with TBUT, the changed values of CXCL1, TNF-α, IFN-γ, CCL11, IL-2, IL-6, TIMP-1 correlated with MGYSS, and the changed concentrations of CXCL1, IFN-γ, CCL11, IL-2, IL-6 correlated with TIMP-1. The data supported IPL treatment could significantly relieve both signs and symptoms of MGD. The therapeutic effect of IPL treatment may originate from regulation of inflammatory cytokines including CXCL1, TNF-α, IFN-γ, CCL11, IL-2, IL-6, and TIMP-1."
https://openalex.org/W3195693168,"Background Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represent a vulnerable population potentially negatively affected by COVID-19-associated reallocation of healthcare resources. Here, we report the impact of COVID-19 on the management of HCC patients in a large tertiary care hospital. Methods We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of HCC patients who presented at the Vienna General Hospital, between 01/DEC/2019 and 30/JUN/2020. We compared patient care before (period 1) and after (period 2) implementation of COVID-19-associated healthcare restrictions on 16/MAR/2020. Results Of 126 patients, majority was male (n = 104, 83%) with a mean age of 66±11 years. Half of patients (n = 57, 45%) had impaired liver function (Child-Pugh stage B/C) and 91 (72%) had intermediate-advanced stage HCC (BCLC B-D). New treatment, was initiated in 68 (54%) patients. Number of new HCC diagnoses did not differ between the two periods (n = 14 vs. 14). While personal visits were reduced, an increase in teleconsultation was observed (period 2). Number of patients with visit delays (n = 31 (30%) vs. n = 10 (10%); p = 0.001) and imaging delays (n = 25 (25%) vs. n = 7 (7%); p = 0.001) was higher in period 2. Accordingly, a reduced number of patients was discussed in interdisciplinary tumor boards (lowest number in April (n = 24), compared to a median number of 57 patients during period 1). Median number of elective/non-elective admissions was not different between the periods. One patient contracted COVID-19 with lethal outcome. Conclusions Changes in patient care included reduced personal contacts but increased telephone visits, and delays in diagnostic procedures. The effects on long-term outcome need to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W3193993648,"Advances in breast cancer screening and treatment have led to an increasing number of breast cancer survivors. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of comorbidities on self-reported quality of life (QOL) and emotional health following a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.Women with a personal history of breast cancer (N = 3,372) were identified from the cross-sectional Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (CPAC) Experiences of Cancer Patients in Transitions Survey. Multinomial (nominal) logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the relationship between burden of comorbidities and overall QOL and emotional health (very poor/poor, fair, good, very good).Of the 3,372 participants, 57% reported at least one chronic condition at the time of breast cancer diagnosis. As the number of chronic conditions at diagnosis increased, the odds of reporting worse quality of life and emotional health following treatment also increased. Specifically, compared to women reporting very good QOL, for each additional chronic condition, women reported significantly higher odds of reporting good (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.32), fair (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.58, 1.96), or poor/very poor (OR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.86, 2.88) QOL. Similarly, for each additional comorbidity, women reported significantly higher odds of reporting good (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.28), fair (OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.46, 1.82), or poor/very poor (OR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.81, 2.60) emotional health, relative to very good emotional health.Breast cancer survivors coping with a high comorbidity burden experience worse overall QOL and emotional health following treatment. This highlights the importance of integrating information on comorbidities into survivorship care to improve the experience and overall outcomes of patients with complex needs."
https://openalex.org/W3195766647,"Imports of seeds for sowing are a major pathway for the introduction of contaminant seeds, and many agricultural weeds globally naturalised originally have entered through this pathway. Effective management of this pathway is a significant means of reducing future plant introductions and helps minimise agricultural losses. Using a national border inspection database, we examined the frequency, origin and identity of contaminant seeds within seed for sowing shipments entering New Zealand between 2014-2018. Our analysis looked at 41,610 seed lots across 1,420 crop seed species from over 90 countries. Overall, contamination was rare, occurring in 1.9% of all seed lots. Among the different crop types, the arable category had the lowest percentage of seed lots contaminated (0.5%) and the forage category had the highest (12.6%). Crop seeds Capsicum, Phaseolus and Solanum had the lowest contamination rates (0.0%). Forage crops Medicago (27.3%) and Trifolium (19.8%) had the highest contamination rates. Out of 191 genera recorded as contaminants, Chenopodium was the most common. Regulated quarantine weeds were the rarest contaminant type, only occurring in 0.06% of seed lots. Sorghum halepense was the most common quarantine species and was only found in vegetable seed lots. Vegetable crop seed lots accounted for approximately half of all quarantine species detections, Raphanus sativus being the most contaminated vegetable crop. Larger seed lots were significantly more contaminated and more likely to contain a quarantine species than smaller seed lots. These findings support International Seed Testing Association rules on maximum seed lot weights. Low contamination rates suggest industry practices are effective in minimising contaminant seeds. Considering New Zealand inspects every imported seed lot, utilises a working sample size 5 times larger than International Seed Testing Association rules require, trades crop seed with approximately half of the world's countries and imports thousands of crop seed species, our study provides a unique overview of contaminant seeds that move throughout the seed for sowing system."
https://openalex.org/W3193632553,"Although racial/ethnic disparities in police contact are well documented, less is known about other dimensions of inequity in policing. Sexual minority groups may face disproportionate police contact. We used data from the P18 Cohort Study (Version 2), a study conducted to measure determinants of inequity in STI/HIV risk among young sexual minority men (YSMM) in New York City, to measure across-time trends, racial/ethnic disparities, and correlates of self-reported stop-and-frisk experience over the cohort follow-up (2014-2019). Over the study period, 43% reported stop-and-frisk with higher levels reported among Black (47%) and Hispanic/Latinx (45%) than White (38%) participants. Stop-and-frisk levels declined over follow-up for each racial/ethnic group. The per capita rates among P18 participants calculated based on self-reported stop-and-frisk were much higher than rates calculated based on New York City Police Department official counts. We stratified respondents' ZIP codes of residence into tertiles of per capita stop rates and observed pronounced disparities in Black versus White stop-and-frisk rates, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate levels of stop-and-frisk activity. YSMM facing the greatest economic vulnerability and mental disorder symptoms were most likely to report stop-and-frisk. Among White respondents levels of past year stop-and-frisk were markedly higher among those who reported past 30 day marijuana use (41%) versus those reporting no use (17%) while among Black and Hispanic/Latinx respondents stop-and-frisk levels were comparable among those reporting marijuana use (38%) versus those reporting no use (31%). These findings suggest inequity in policing is observed not only among racial/ethnic but also sexual minority groups and that racial/ethnic YSMM, who are at the intersection of multiple minority statuses, face disproportionate risk. Because the most socially vulnerable experience disproportionate stop-and-frisk risk, we need to reach YSMM with community resources to promote health and wellbeing as an alternative to targeting this group with stressful and stigmatizing police exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3195081768,"The state of São Paulo, Brazil, where more than 94.000 dentists are currently registered, has become the epicenter of COVID-19 in Latin America. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on dentists in this state. A semi-structured questionnaire was sent via e-mail to 93.280 dentists with active registration in the Dental Council of São Paulo (CROSP). The impact of COVID-19 pandemic was assessed through questions related to demographic, socioeconomic, dental practice characteristics and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between all the variables (p&lt;0.05). Over 8 days, 2113 responses were received. Only 26.52% of the sample reported a low-income reduction (from 0–10%), while the majority of dentists reported a more negative financial impact, 35.6% with a reduction of more than 50% of their monthly income. Dentists who worked in the private sector and at the capital had a greater financial impact when compared to those of the public sector and countryside of the state (p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, about 83% reported not having received any specific training to control the transmission of coronavirus in the health area. This study provides evidence of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the routine of dentists in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Hopefully, this study will help dental and other health care professionals to better understand the consequences of disease in dental settings and strengthen preparedness throughout the dental health care system."
https://openalex.org/W3195346389,"Financial inclusion has generally been considered an effective mechanism to support economic growth and reduce Vietnam’s poverty for the last decade. While the importance of financial inclusion to economic growth or macroeconomic stability has been widely examined, it appears that the degree of financial inclusion across Vietnam has not attracted attention from academics and policymakers. In particular, a convergence of financial inclusion across provinces in Vietnam has never been examined. This paper is conducted to examine the static and dynamic distributions of financial inclusion across provinces in Vietnam. The latest three biennial surveys from 2014 to 2018 and a novel approach known as the dynamic kernel density function are used in this study. Our results indicate that Vietnam’s economic growth and development over the 2014–2018 period is relatively inclusive. The evidence also demonstrates that households provided with access to multiple sources of finance depend significantly on the provincial level of income. We also find that provinces located in the national key economic regions, including (i) the Northern region and (ii) the Southern region, appear to achieve a higher degree of financial inclusiveness. Our findings also confirm the catching-up from the financially disadvantaged provinces to financially advantaged provinces locating within the key economic regions. We argue that understanding the asymmetric effect of economic growth on financial inclusion will be helpful for the Vietnamese government in formulating and implementing economic policies promptly to secure the sustainable and inclusive goals of economic growth and development in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3195564332,"Disclosure of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) status is important to prevent the spread of HIV and maintain the health of people living with HIV, their spouses, and the community. Despite the benefits of disclosure, many people living with HIV delay disclosing their status to those close to them thereby increasing the risk for disease transmission. This study aimed to determine the barriers to timely disclosure of HIV serostatus for people living with HIV in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and identify what motivated disclosure.A qualitative descriptive study using in-depth individual interviews was conducted with10 participants attending HIV care and treatment centers in Dar es Salaam. The participants were people living with HIV who had delayed disclosing their serostatus for more than one month after diagnosis. Data was analyzed using qualitative content analysis.Three categories emerged from the analysis: Barriers hindering timely disclosure, motivation for disclosure of serostatus, and consequences of delayed disclosure. Barriers to timely disclosure included denial of one's status, the fear of stigmatization, fear of being separated or divorced, the need to protect loved ones, and lack of adequate knowledge about the disease. Reasons that motivated disclosure included gaining social support, preventing disease transmission and wanting to be at peace.Timely disclosure is hindered by stigma because HIV is negatively perceived by the public. People living with HIV prefer not to disclose to avoid the negative consequences of disclosure, especially because of fear of being discriminated against and losing their social status, which plays a major role in social status in Tanzania. Trust and adequate counseling from health care workers helps prompt disclosure."
https://openalex.org/W3195388831,"Deep-sea hydrothermal vent habitats are small, rare and support unique species through chemosynthesis. As this vulnerable ecosystem is increasingly threatened by human activities, management approaches should address biodiversity conservation. Diversity distribution data provide a useful basis for management approaches as patterns of β-diversity (the change in diversity from site to site) can guide conservation decisions. Our question is whether such patterns are similar enough across vent systems to support a conservation strategy that can be deployed regardless of location. We compile macrofaunal species occurrence data for vent systems in three geological settings in the North Pacific: volcanic arc, back-arc and mid-ocean ridge. Recent discoveries in the Mariana region provide the opportunity to characterize diversity at many vent sites. We examine the extent to which diversity distribution patterns differ among the systems by comparing pairwise β-diversity, nestedness and their additive components. A null model approach that tests whether species compositions of each site pair are more or less similar than random provides insight into community assembly processes. We resolve several taxonomic uncertainties and find that the Mariana arc and back-arc share only 8% of species despite their proximity. Species overlap, species replacement and richness differences create different diversity distributions within the three vent systems; the arc system exhibits much greater β-diversity than both the back-arc and mid-ocean ridge systems which, instead, show greater nestedness. The influence of nestedness on β-diversity also increased from the arc to back-arc to ridge. Community assembly processes appear more deterministic in the arc and ridge systems while back-arc site pairs deviate little from the null expectation. These analyses reflect the need for a variety of management strategies that consider the character of diversity distribution to protect hydrothermal vents, especially in the context of mining hydrothermal deposits."
https://openalex.org/W3194921266,"Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) improves respiratory muscle function and might enhance weaning outcomes in patients with weaning difficulties. An electronic inspiratory loading device provides valid, automatically processed information on breathing characteristics during IMT sessions. Adherence to and quality of IMT, as reflected by work of breathing and power generated by inspiratory muscles, are related to improvements in inspiratory muscle function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of an electronic training device to assess and provide real-time feedback on breathing characteristics during inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in patient with weaning difficulties. Patients with weaning difficulties performed daily IMT sessions against a tapered flow-resistive load of approximately 30 to 50% of the patient’s maximal inspiratory pressure. Airflow and airway pressure measurements were simultaneously collected with the training device (POWERbreatheKH2, POWERbreathe International Ltd, UK) and a portable spirometer (reference device, Pocket-Spiro USB/BT100, M.E.C, Belgium). Breath by breath analysis of 1002 breaths of 27 training sessions (n = 13) against a mean load of 46±16% of the patient’s maximal inspiratory pressure were performed. Good to excellent agreement (Intraclass correlation coefficients: 0.73–0.97) was observed for all breathing characteristics. When individual differences were plotted against mean values of breaths recorded by both devices, small average biases were observed for all breathing characteristics. To conclude, the training device provides valid assessments of breathing characteristics to quantify inspiratory muscle effort (e.g. work of breathing and peak power) during IMT in patients with weaning difficulties. Availability of valid real-time data of breathing responses provided to both the physical therapist and the patient, can be clinically usefull to optimize the training stimulus. By adapting the external load based on the visual feedback of the training device, respiratory muscle work and power generation during IMT can be maximized during the training."
https://openalex.org/W3195839834,"Neonicotinoid pesticides undermine pollinating insects including bumblebees. However, we have previously shown that mitochondrial damage induced by neonicotinoids can be corrected by 670nm light exposure. But we do not know if this protection extends to immunity or what the minimum effective level of 670nm light exposure is necessary for protection. We use whole body bee respiration in vivo as a metric of neonicotinoid damage and assess the amount of light exposure needed to correct it. We reveal that only 1 min of 670nm exposure is sufficient to correct respiratory deficits induced by pesticide and that this also completely repairs damaged immunocompetence measured by haemocyte counts and the antibacterial action of hemolymph. Further, this single 1 min exposure remains effective for 3-6 days. Longer exposures were not more effective. Such data are key for development of protective light strategies that can be delivered by relatively small economic devices placed in hives."
https://openalex.org/W3162384178,"Affective sharing is a bottom-up process involving automatic processing of sensory inputs that facilitate vicarious experience of another's emotional state. It is grounded directly in the prior experiences of the perceiver. In adults, vicarious ratings of affective touch match the known velocity tuning and hypothesised anatomical distribution of C-tactile afferents (CT), a subclass of C-fibre which respond preferentially to low force/velocity stroking touch, typically perceived as pleasant. Given the centrality of touch to early nurturing interactions, here we examined whether primary school aged children's vicarious ratings of affective touch show the same anatomical and velocity specific patterns reported in adults. Forty-four children aged between 8 and 11 (mean age 9, 24 male) rated a sequence of video clips depicting one individual being touched by another on 5 different upper-body sites (palm, dorsal forearm, ventral forearm, upper-arm and back) at 3 different velocities (static, CT optimal, slow stroking and non-CT optimal, fast stroking). Immediately after viewing each clip, participants were asked to rate how pleasant they perceived the touch to be. While children rated the CT optimal velocity significantly higher than static or non-CT optimal touch, unlike adults their ratings did not vary across skin sites. This difference may reflect the fact children's ratings are grounded in bottom-up affective resonance while adults also draw on top-down cognitive evaluation of the broader social context when rating the stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W3194727435,"Introduction Maternal and perinatal deaths occurring in low and middle income countries could be prevented with timely access to maternal and new-born care. In order to increase access to maternal and child health services, a well-functioning referral system that allows for continuity of care across different tiers of healthcare is required. A reliable healthcare system, with adequate numbers of skilled staff, resources and mechanisms, is critical to ensuring that access to care is available when the need arises. Material and methods This descriptive, qualitative study design was used to explore barriers to implementing a reliable referral system. Twelve individual qualitative interviews were conducted with health care providers working in rural and semi-urban district hospitals in the Northern, Western, Eastern and Southern zones of Tanzania. Thematic analysis guided analysis of data. Results Three (3) main and interconnected themes were abstracted from the data relating to participants’ experiences of referring women with obstetric complications to adequate obstetric care. These were: 1. Adhering to a rigid referral protocol; 2. Completing the referral of women to an adequate health facility and 3. Communicating the condition of the woman with obstetric complications between the referring and receiving facilities. Conclusion Because of referral regulations, assistant medical officers were unable to make referral decisions even when they felt that a referral was needed. The lack of availability of hospital transport as well as the lack of a reliable feedback mechanism, prohibited effective referrals of patients. The Ministry of Health should revise the referral protocol to allow all clinicians to provide referrals, including assistant medical officers- who make up the majority of clinical staff in rural health care facilities. A mechanism to ensure effective communication between the referral facility and the tertiary care hospital should be instituted for quality and continuity of care. Furthermore, health care facilities should put aside budget for fuelling the ambulance for effective referrals."
https://openalex.org/W3194914116,"The development of inhibitors is the main complication of haemophilia A (HA) treatment. Immune tolerance induction (ITI) is the treatment of choice for inhibitor eradication. We describe the methodology of the Brazilian Immune Tolerance Induction (BrazIT) Study, aimed to identify clinical, genetic, and immune biomarkers associated with response to ITI and inhibitor recurrence. This cohort study includes people with HA (PwHA) and inhibitors (a) who require bypassing agents to treat and/or prevent bleeding, and (b) who are at any stage of ITI treatment. Patients are included in each haemophilia treatment centre (HTC). Factor VIII (FVIII) and inhibitor assessments are performed at local laboratories of each HTC. The ITI regimen followed the national protocol of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. All PwHA starts with low-dose ITI (50 IU/kg three times weekly); high-dose regimen (100 IU/kg daily) is used if there is lack of response to the low-dose ITI. Outcomes are classified as total or partial success, and failure. Standardized case report forms with clinical, laboratory, and treatment data are collected from medical files and interviews. Blood samples are collected for genetic and immune biomarkers at the time of inclusion in the study and at the end of ITI. The study is ongoing and, currently, 202/250 (80.8%) PwHA from 15 HTCs have been included. BrazIT Study is the largest cohort of PwHA and inhibitor under treatment with the same ITI regimen reported to date. This study is likely to contribute with novel predictors of ITI response."
https://openalex.org/W3195044951,"Findings from previous comparative genomics studies of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) suggest genomic variation among the genotypes may have phenotypic implications. We investigated the diversity in the phenotypic profiles of the main prevalent MTBC genotypes in West Africa. Thirty-six whole genome sequenced drug susceptible MTBC isolates belonging to lineages 4, 5 and 6 were included in this study. The isolates were phenotypically characterized for urease activity, tween hydrolysis, Thiophen-2-Carboxylic Acid Hydrazide (TCH) susceptibility, nitric oxide production, and growth rate in both liquid (7H9) and solid media (7H11 and Löwenstein-Jensen (L-J)). Lineage 4 isolates showed the highest growth rate in both liquid (p = 0.0003) and on solid (L-J) media supplemented with glycerol (p<0.001) or pyruvate (p = 0.005). L6 isolates optimally utilized pyruvate compared to glycerol (p<0.001), whereas L5 isolates grew similarly on both media (p = 0.05). Lineage 4 isolates showed the lowest average time to positivity (TTP) (p = 0.01; Average TTP: L4 = 15days, L5 = 16.7days, L6 = 29.7days) and the highest logCFU/mL (p = 0.04; average logCFU/mL L4 = 5.9, L5 = 5.0, L6 = 4.4) on 7H11 supplemented with glycerol, but there was no significant difference in growth on 7H11 supplemented with pyruvate (p = 0.23). The highest release of nitrite was recorded for L5 isolates, followed by L4 and L6 isolates. However, the reverse was observed in the urease activity for the lineages. All isolates tested were resistant to TCH except for one L6 isolate. Comparative genomic analyses revealed several mutations that might explain the diverse phenotypic profiles of these isolates. Our findings showed significant phenotypic diversity among the MTBC lineages used for this study."
https://openalex.org/W3195074976,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that damages the insulation of nerve cell fibers in the brain and spinal cord. In the visual system, this demyelination results in a robust delay of visually evoked potentials (VEPs), even in the absence of overt clinical symptoms such as blurred vision. VEPs, therefore, offer an avenue for early diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and, potentially, insight into the differential impairment of specific pathways. A primary hypothesis has been that visual stimuli driving the magno-, parvo-, and konio-cellular pathways should lead to differential effects because these pathways differ considerably in terms of myelination. Experimental tests of this hypothesis, however, have led to conflicting results. Some groups reported larger latency effects for chromatic stimuli, while others found equivalent effects across stimulus types. We reasoned that this lack of pathway specificity could, at least in part, be attributed to the relatively coarse measure of pathway impairment afforded by the latency of a VEP. We hypothesized that network synchrony could offer a more sensitive test of pathway impairments. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the synchrony of occipital electroencephalography (EEG) signals during the presentation of visual stimuli designed to bias activity to one of the three pathways. Specifically, we quantified synchrony in the occipital EEG using two graph-theoretic measures of functional connectivity: the characteristic path length (L; a measure of long-range connectivity) and the clustering coefficient (CC; a measure of short-range connectivity). Our main finding was that L and CC were both smaller in the MS group than in controls. Notably, this change in functional connectivity was limited to the magnocellular pathway. The effect sizes (Hedge’s g) were 0.89 (L) and 1.26 (CC) measured with magno stimuli. Together, L and CC define the small-world nature of a network, and our finding can be summarized as a reduction in the small-worldness of the magnocellular network. We speculate that the reduced efficiency of information transfer associated with a reduction in small-worldness could underlie visual deficits in MS. Relating these measures to differential diagnoses and disease progression is an important avenue for future work."
https://openalex.org/W3195751076,"The identification of novel therapies, new strategies for combination of therapies, and repurposing of drugs approved for other indications are all important for continued progress in the fight against lung cancers. Antibodies that target immune checkpoints can unmask an immunologically hot tumor from the immune system of a patient. However, despite accounts of significant tumor regression resulting from these medications, most patients do not respond. In this study, we sought to use protein expression and RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and two smaller studies deposited onto the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to advance our hypothesis that inhibition of SHP-2, a tyrosine phosphatase, will improve the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) that target PD-1 or PD-L1 in lung cancers. We first collected protein expression data from The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) to study the association of SHP-2 and PD-L1 expression in lung adenocarcinomas. RNA sequencing data was collected from the same subjects through the NCI Genetic Data Commons and evaluated for expression of the PTPN11 (SHP-2) and CD274 (PD-L1) genes. We then analyzed RNA sequencing data from a series of melanoma patients who were either treatment naïve or resistant to ICI therapy. PTPN11 and CD274 expression was compared between groups. Finally, we analyzed gene expression and drug response data collected from 21 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients for PTPN11 and CD274 expression. From the three studies, we hypothesize that the activity of SHP-2, rather than the expression, likely controls the expression of PD-L1 as only a weak relationship between PTPN11 and CD274 expression in either lung adenocarcinomas or melanomas was observed. Lastly, the expression of CD274, not PTPN11, correlates with response to ICI in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3193809969,"Cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) overproduction and eosinophil activation are hallmarks of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). However, pathogenic mechanisms of AERD remain to be clarified. Here, we aimed to find the significance of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in association with cysteinyl leukotriene E4 (LTE4) production, leading to eosinophil degranulation. To evaluate levels of serum TGF-β1, first cohort enrolled AERD (n = 336), ATA (n = 442) patients and healthy control subjects (HCs, n = 253). In addition, second cohort recruited AERD (n = 34) and ATA (n = 25) patients to investigate a relation between levels of serum TGF-β1 and urinary LTE4. The function of TGF-β1 in LTE4 production was further demonstrated by ex vivo (human peripheral eosinophils) or in vivo (BALB/c mice) experiment. As a result, the levels of serum TGF-β1 were significantly higher in AERD patients than in ATA patients or HCs (P = .001; respectively). Moreover, levels of serum TGF-β1 and urinary LTE4 had a positive correlation (r = 0.273, P = .037). In the presence of TGF-β1, leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) expression was enhanced in peripheral eosinophils to produce LTE4, which sequentially induced eosinophil degranulation via the p38 pathway. When mice were treated with TGF-β1, significantly induced eosinophilia with increased LTE4 production in the lung tissues were noted. These findings suggest that higher levels of TGF-β1 in AERD patients may contribute to LTE4 production via enhancing LTC4S expression which induces eosinophil degranulation, accelerating airway inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3193883842,"Eswatini has the highest global prevalence of HIV despite decades of universal access to free antiretroviral therapy (ART). We conducted a mixed methods study to investigate barriers to ART adherence among women living with HIV (WLHIV) in rural communities of Eswatini. Qualitative findings were reported in our previous publication. This subsequent paper expands on our qualitative analysis to examine the magnitude to which identified barriers impacted ART adherence among WLHIV in the same communities.We used an exploratory sequential design to collect data from WLHIV (n = 166) in rural Eswatini. Quantitative data were collected using interviewer-administered survey questionnaires between October and November 2017. ART adherence was measured using the CASE Adherence Index, with scores less than 10 indicating nonadherence. Log-binomial regression models were used to examine the extent to which critical barriers affected ART adherence among study participants.A majority of the women in our study (56%) were nonadherent to ART. Of the barriers identified in our prior qualitative analysis, only eight were found to be significantly associated with ART nonadherence in our quantitative analysis. These include, with adjusted risk ratios (ARR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI): household food insecurity (ARR: 3.16, 95% CI: 1.33-7.52), maltreatment by clinic staff (ARR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.94-3.66), forgetfulness (ARR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.41-2.31), stress (ARR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.14-1.88), gossip (ARR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.21-2.04), mode of transport (ARR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.44-0.79), age (ARR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99), and lack of community support (ARR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.35-0.85).Among numerous barriers identified in our study, food insecurity was found to be a significant contributor toward ART nonadherence among women living with HIV in rural Eswatini. Future strategies aimed at improving ART adherence in Eswatini should include programs which provide food and nutrition support for people living with HIV, particularly rural women living in poverty."
https://openalex.org/W3194363853,"The advancement of Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has laid more emphasis on reducing the parameter amount and storage space of the model in addition to the automatic and accurate fault diagnosis. In this case, this paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (LCNN) method for intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, which can largely satisfy the need of less parameter amount and storage space as well as high accuracy. First, light-weight convolution blocks are constructed through basic elements such as spatial separable convolutions with the aim to effectively reduce model parameters. Secondly, the LCNN model for the intelligent fault diagnosis is constructed via lightweight convolution blocks instead of the tradi-tional convolution operation. Finally, to address the “black box” problem, the entire network is visualized through Tensorboard and t-distribution stochastic neighbor embedding. The results demonstrate that when the number of lightweight convolutional blocks reaches 6, the diagnosis accuracy of the LCNN model exceeds 99.9%. And the proposed model has become the most robust with parameters significantly decreasing. Furthermore, the proposed LCNN model has realized accurate, automatic, and robust fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, which makes it more suitable for deployment under the IIoT context."
https://openalex.org/W3194602387,"Acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) is an important, life-threatening complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). To investigate the value of multiple simultaneous colon biopsies in improving diagnostic accuracy in patients with aGvHD, we retrospectively analyzed 157 patients after alloHSCT. The biopsies were evaluated individually using three established histological grading systems (Lerner, Sale, and Melson). The maximum, minimum, median, and mean histological aGvHD grades were calculated for each patient, and the results were correlated with the Glucksberg grade of clinical manifestation of GvHD, steroid therapy status, and outcome. We found that multiple colon biopsies enhanced diagnostic sensitivity. Moreover, higher histological grades correlated with steroid therapy initiation and refractoriness; the latter particularly occurred when advanced damage was present in all samples and healthy colon mucosa was reduced or absent. On multivariate analysis, the minimal Lerner and Glucksberg grades for intestinal aGvHD were significantly associated with steroid treatment failure. Ninety-nine patients died. The median survival was 285 days after the biopsies were taken. Fifteen patients died from relapse of their underling disorder and 84 from other causes, mostly infection (53 patients) and GvHD (14 patients). Multivariate analysis revealed a significant association between none-relapse mortality and the mean Lerner grade, minimum Melson grade, Glucksberg organ stage, and platelet counts. Thus, we found the Lerner system to be superior to the other grading methods in most instances and histologic evaluation of multiple simultaneously obtained biopsies from the colon to result in a higher diagnostic yield, which helps plan systemic steroid treatment while predicting treatment response and outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3195340770,"Uricase-deficient rats could be one of the optimal model animals to study hyperuricemia. The present study aimed to find the biological differences between uricase-deficient (Kunming-DY rats) and wild-type male rats. Uricase-deficient rats and wild-type rats were commonly bred. Their body weight, water and food consumption, 24-h urine and feces, uric acid in serum and organs, and serum indexes were recorded or assayed. Organs, including the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, thymus, stomach, duodenum, and ileum, were examined using a routine hematoxylin-eosin staining assay. We found that the growth of male uricase-deficient rats was retarded. These rats excreted more urine than the wild-type rats. Their organ indexes (organ weight body weight ratio), of the heart, liver, kidney, and thymus significantly increased, while those of the stomach and small intestine significantly decreased. The uricase-deficient rats had a significantly higher level of serum uric acid and excreted more uric acid via urine at a higher concentration. Except for the liver, uric acid increased in organs and intestinal juice of uricase-deficient rats. Histological examination of the uricase-deficient rats showed mild injuries to the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, thymus, stomach, duodenum, and ileum. Our results suggest that uricase-deficient rats have a different biological pattern from the wild-type rats. Uricase deficiency causes growth retardation of young male rats and the subsequent increase in serum uric acid results in mild organs injuries, especially in the kidney and liver."
https://openalex.org/W3195788315,"Proper mechanical model selection is critical in tunnel support design and stability analysis, especially to reflect the creep and strain-softening behavior of soft rock. We present a coupled nonlinear Burgers strain-softening (NBSS) model and numerical calculation method to investigate the coupled effects of creep and strain-softening of soft rock tunnels. The nonlinear elastic-viscous model is used to simulate the steady creep behavior of mudstone, and the nonlinear viscoplastic strain-softening model is used to simulate the accelerated creep behavior and post-peak strength attenuation behavior. The experimental results show that the viscoplastic parameters and post-peak softening parameters of mudstone are highly sensitive to confining pressure and exhibit nonlinear characteristics. The accelerated creep curve obtained by the numerical calculation is consistent with the experiments, which verifies the model reliability. We use the NBSS and nonlinear Burgers Mohr-Coulomb (NBMC) models to calculate the plastic zone distribution characteristics and deformation law. The distribution of the plastic zone calculated by the NBSS model is larger with more localized fractures. The NBSS model is useful for studying the evolution of stress and displacement fields of complex surrounding rock mass, which provides important theoretical guidelines for the support design and stability analysis of soft rock tunnel engineering."
https://openalex.org/W3193635119,"Background Gastric cancer (GC) is a multifactorial disease with high mortality. Anti-HER2 therapy is a promising strategy in GC treatment and trastuzumab was approved by FDA (Food and Drug Administration) as the first and the second line of treatment of the disease. Purpose The aim of the study was to examine the effectiveness of a combination of etoposide with trastuzumab or pertuzumab in AGS gastric cancer cells and breast cancer cells such as MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954. Methods and findings The cytotoxic effects of the tested compounds against gastric and breast cancer cells were checked by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The anti-proliferative potential was analyzed by the incorporation of [ 3 H]-thymidine into DNA. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry was used to demonstrate the effect of the compounds on apoptosis. The mitochondrial membrane potential, and the activity of caspase-8 and caspase-9 were assessed. Autophagosomes and autolysosomes formation was checked by flow cytometry. The concentrations of Beclin-1, LC3A and LC3B were performed using ELISA. The expression of LC3A/B was also determined. The results from our study proved that the combination of etoposide with anti-HER2 antibodies was not cytotoxic against breast cancer cells, whereas the combination of etoposide with anti-HER2 antibodies decreased viability and DNA biosynthesis in gastric cancer cells. The interaction of etoposide with pertuzumab or trastuzumab induced programmed cell death via extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in AGS gastric cancer cells, but did not affect autophagy, where a decrease of Beclin-1, LC3A and LC3B was observed in comparison with the untreated control. Conclusions The study demonstrated that etoposide (12.5 μM) with pertuzumab represent a promising strategy in gastric cancer treatment, but further in vivo examinations are also required."

Then, by applying social network analysis (SNA) to study NEV industry development node spatial correlations, we conclude that there is no overall hierarchical structure. The SNA are applied to examine spatial correlations with respect to NEV industry innovation efficiency in each province, and to analyze the role and position of each province in the spatial correlation network.

https://openalex.org/W3193865121,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has now affected tens of millions of people globally. It is the hope that vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will deliver a comprehensive solution to this global pandemic; however, this will require extensive national vaccination programs. Ultimately, clinical conditions and even sudden unexplained death will occur around the time of vaccination, thus a distinction needs to be made between events that are causally related to the vaccine or temporally related to vaccination. This study aimed to estimate the background occurrence of 43 clinical conditions in the Japanese population. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2013 to 2019 using data from two large healthcare claims databases (MDV and JMDC) in Japan. The estimated number of new cases and incidence were calculated based on the actual number of new cases identified in the databases. The PubMed and Ichushi-web databases, as well as grey literature such as guidelines and government statistics, were also searched to identify any publications related to incidence of these conditions in Japan. Results and conclusion The estimates of the number of total cases and incidence were similar for the MDV and JMDC databases for some diseases. In addition, some estimates were similar to those in the scientific literature. For example, from the MDV and JMDC databases, estimates of incidence of confirmed Bell’s palsy in 2019 were 41.7 and 47.9 cases per 100,000 population per year, respectively. These estimates were of the same order from the scientific publication. Determining whether clinical conditions occurring around the time of vaccination are causally or only temporally related to vaccination will be critical for public health decision makers as well as for the general public. Comparison of background occurrence at the population level may provide some additional objective evidence for the evaluation of temporality or causality."
https://openalex.org/W3194324821,"Climate change and global warming have serious adverse impacts on tropical forests. In particular, climate change may induce changes in leaf phenology. However, in tropical dry forests where tree diversity is high, species responses to climate change differ. The objective of this research is to analyze the impact of climate variability on the leaf phenology in Thailand's tropical forests. Machine learning approaches were applied to model how leaf phenology in dry dipterocarp forest in Thailand responds to climate variability and El Niño. First, we used a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to cluster mature leaf phenology at the species level. Then, leaf phenology patterns in each group along with litterfall phenology and climate data were analyzed according to their response time. After that, a Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM) was used to create model to predict leaf phenology in dry dipterocarp forest. The SOM-based clustering was able to classify 92.24% of the individual trees. The result of mapping the clustering data with lag time analysis revealed that each cluster has a different lag time depending on the timing and amount of rainfall. Incorporating the time lags improved the performance of the litterfall prediction model, reducing the average root mean square percent error (RMSPE) from 14.35% to 12.06%. This study should help researchers understand how each species responds to climate change. The litterfall prediction model will be useful for managing dry dipterocarp forest especially with regards to forest fires."

This study established a methodology with the objective of evaluating new associated strategies to reduce the risk of cross-transmission in a health environment by simulating spread of potentially contaminated dispersion particles (PCDP) in the environment. This crossover study, was conducted in a school clinic environment (4 clinics containing 12 dental chairs each). As a positive control group (without barriers), 12 professionals activated at the same time the turbine of dental drill, for one minute, with a bacterial solution (Lactobacillus casei Shirota, 1.5x10 8 CFU/mL), which had been added in the cooling reservoir of the dental equipment. In the experimental groups, the professionals made use of; a) an individual biosafety barrier in dentistry (IBBD) which consists of a metal support covered by a disposable PVC film barrier; b) a Mobile Unit of Disinfection by Ultraviolet-C, consisting of 8 UV lamps-C of 95W, of 304μW/cm 2 of irradiance each, connected for 15 minutes (UV-C) and; c) the association between the two methods (IBBD + UV-C). In each clinic, 56 Petri dishes containing MRS agar were positioned on the lamps, benches and on the floor. In addition, plates were placed prior to each test (negative control group) and plates were also placed in the corridor that connects the four clinics. In the groups without barrier and IBBD + UV-C the passive air microorganisms in Petri dishes was also evaluated at times of 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the end of the dental’s drill activation. The mean (standard deviation) of CFU of L . casei Shirota for the positive control group was 3905 (1521), while in the experimental groups the mean using the IBBD was 940 (466) CFU, establishing a reduction on average, of 75% (p&lt;0.0001). For the UV-C group, the mean was 260 (309) CFU and the association of the use of IBBD + UV-C promoted an overall average count of 152 (257) CFU, establishing a reduction on average of 93% and 96%, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). Considering these results and the study model used, the individual biosafety barrier associated with UV-C technology showed to be efficient strategies to reduce the dispersion of bioaerosols generated in an environment with high rate of PCDP generation and may be an alternative for the improvement of biosafety in different healthy environment."

Further research is needed to evaluate the ability of the scale to accurately identify and classify positive psychotic experiences (PE) in the general population.To provide psychometric evidence about the accuracy of the CAPE-P15 for detecting PE in a sample of Chilean adolescents from the general population and classifying them according to their PE severity levels.We administered the CAPE-P15 to a general sample of 1594 students aged 12 to 19. Based on Item Response Theory (IRT), we tested the accuracy of the instrument using two main parameters: difficulty and discrimination power of the 15 items.We found that the scale provides very accurate information about PE, particularly for high PE levels. The items with the highest capability to determine the presence of the latent trait were those assessing perceptual anomalies (auditory and visual hallucinations), bizarre experiences (a double has taken the place of others; being controlled by external forces), and persecutory ideation (conspiracy against me).The CAPE-P15 is an accurate and suitable tool to screen PE and to accurately classify and differentiate PE levels in adolescents from the general population.

The goal of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and precision of platelet counting using a new microvolume (8 μL), absolute counting, 1.5 kg cytometry-based blood analyzer, the rHEALTH ONE (rHEALTH) in comparison with the International Society of Laboratory Hematology (ISLH) platelet method, which uses a cytometer and an impedance analyzer.Inclusion eligibility were healthy adults (M/F) ages 18-80 for donation of fingerprick and venous blood samples. Samples were from a random N = 31 volunteers from a single U.S. site. Samples were serially diluted to test thrombocytopenic ranges. Interfering substances and conditions were tested, including RBC fragments, platelet fragments, cholesterol, triglycerides, lipids, anti-platelet antibodies, and temperature.The concordance between the rHEALTH and ISLH methods had a slope = 1.030 and R2 = 0.9684. The rHEALTH method showed a correlation between capillary and venous blood samples (slope = 0.9514 and R2 = 0.9684). Certain interferents changed platelet recovery: RBC fragments and anti-platelet antibodies with the ISLH method; platelet fragments and anti-platelet antibodies on the rHEALTH; and RBC fragments, platelets fragments, triglycerides and LDL on the clinical impedance analyzer. The rHEALTH's precision ranged from 3.1-8.0%, and the ISLH from 1.0-10.5%.The rHEALTH method provides similar results with the reference method and good correlation between adult capillary and venous blood samples.

https://openalex.org/W3196100770,"Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic and a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist. At subanesthetic dose, ketamine can relieve pain and work as a fast-acting antidepressant, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate the mode of action underlying the effects of acute subanesthetic ketamine treatment by bioinformatics analyses of miRNAs in the medial prefrontal cortex of male C57BL/6J mice. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses of the genes putatively targeted by ketamine-responsive prefrontal miRNAs revealed that acute subanesthetic ketamine modifies ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Validation analysis suggested that miR-148a-3p and miR-128-3p are the main players responsible for the subanesthetic ketamine-mediated alteration of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis through varied regulation of ubiquitin ligases E2 and E3. Collectively, our data imply that the prefrontal miRNA-dependent modulation of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is at least partially involved in the mode of action by acute subanesthetic ketamine treatment."

Nevertheless, data regarding associated factors for weight gain are limited and inconsistent.The present study aimed to determine the risk of metabolic syndrome and its associated factors among psychiatric patients.A cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted among all psychiatric patients at the Psychiatric Unit of the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from March 1- April 1, 2018. All eligible psychiatric patients were interviewed about their socio-demographic status,and clinical characteristics and useful parameters for the study were recorded from the medical records of the patients and by measuring waist to height ratio. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline information.Binary logistic regression was used to determine the associated factors and P-value <0.05 and confidence interval (CI) of 95% were used as cut off points for determining statistical significance.From 300 patients included in the study, 168(56%) patients were females,and around 50.3% of the study participants had low literacy levels. As per waist to a height ratio scale, 58% (174) of the patients had a risk of metabolic syndrome. The Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that sex (p-<0.0001), occupation (p -0.032), marital status (p-0.006), and distance from the hospital (p<0.0001) were statistically significant determinants of metabolic syndrome risk in the psychiatric patient in our setting.The majority of the psychiatric patients in the study setting had a risk of metabolic syndrome.

https://openalex.org/W3195066001,"This study aims to explore gender-related differences in persistent opioid use following an acute pain episode and evaluate potential explanatory variables.This retrospective population-based study using administrative databases included all opioid-naïve patients in Ontario with renal colic between 2013 and 2017. The primary outcome was to assess any association between persistent opioid use at 3-6 months by gender. Key confounding covariates and explanatory variables examined included both care- and patient-related factors, specifically past evidence of mental health diagnoses.The dataset of 64,240 males and 37,656 females demonstrated that 8.7% of males and 9.6% of females had evidence of persistent opioid use 3-6 months after presentation (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05, 1.17). Females had a higher incidence of mental health services utilization [44.5% vs 29.6% (p<0.001)] and were more likely to be on a provincial disability program [5.1% vs 3.8% (p<0.001)]. Age, income quintile, mental health diagnoses and dose of opioid prescribed were associated with the primary outcome in both genders. On adjusted analysis for multiple confounding and explanatory variables, females were still more likely than males to demonstrate persistent opioid use (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01, 1.13) with even more pronounced associations at 1-2 years.After controlling for key covariates, females are at slightly higher risk of demonstrating long term opioid use following an episode of renal colic. Evidence of prior mental health service utilization and acute colic care did not appear to significantly explain these observations."

Participants were randomized into usual physiotherapy care (control, n = 14) and usual physiotherapy care plus a wearables-based walking intervention (experimental, n = 12). The intervention duration was 8 weeks. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment rate, adherence to the intervention, dropout rate, and serious adverse events reporting rate. Other outcomes included disability and pain (primary); and physical activity level, daily walking steps, depression, pain catastrophizing and fear of movement (secondary). The outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention and 26 weeks post-randomization follow-up.Adherence of experimental participants with the prescribed walking program was moderate. Four participants dropped out during the intervention, and no serious adverse events were reported. Participants in the experimental group showed significant improvement in pain at 26 weeks (β = -0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.66, -0.10; P = .013), compared with the control group. No between-group differences were found for disability at any time point and pain immediately post-intervention. Experimental participants demonstrated post-intervention improvement in light-intensity (β = 156.71; 95% CI 86.79, 226.64; P < .001), moderate-intensity physical activity (β = 0.46; 95% CI 0.12, 0.80; P = .012), and daily walking steps (β = 7099.13; 95% CI 4522.93, 9675.32; P < .001). Experimental participants demonstrated post-intervention increase in pain catastrophizing (β = 0.52, 95% CI 0.18, 0.86; P = .006). No between-group differences were found for pain catastrophizing at 26 weeks and other secondary outcomes.Usual physiotherapy care plus a wearables-based walking intervention program was safe and moderately feasible, and provided significant reduction in pain at 26 weeks as well as increasing the total volume of light- and moderate-intensity physical activity, and daily walking steps immediately post-intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3195774703,"To investigate the association between relative grip strength and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) independently and in combination with body mass index (BMI) in Korean adults.The cross-sectional study includes 2,811 men and women (age 40 to 92 years old) with no history of heart disease, stroke, or cancer. Relative grip strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and calculated by dividing absolute grip strength by body weight. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of T2DM by sex-specific quintiles of relative grip strength. In a joint analysis, participants were classified into 4 groups: ""weak (lowest 20% quintile one) and normal weight (BMI <25.0 kg/m2)"", ""weak and overweight/obese (BMI ≥25.0 kg/m2)"", ""strong (upper 80% four quintiles) and normal weight"" or ""strong and overweight/obese"".Among the 2,811 participants, 371 were identified as having T2DM. Compared with the lowest quintile of relative grip strength (weakest), the ORs (95% CIs) of T2DM were 0.73 (0.53-1.02), 0.68 (0.48-0.97), 0.72 (0.50-1.03), and 0.48 (0.32-0.74) in upper quintiles two, three, four, and five, respectively, after adjusting for BMI and other potential confounders. In the joint analysis, compared with the ""weak and overweight/obese"" reference group, the odds of T2DM [ORs (95% CIs)] was lower in the ""strong and overweight/obese"" group [0.65 (0.46-0.92)] and the ""strong and normal weight"" group [0.49 (0.35-0.67)], after adjusting for potential confounders.In this cross-sectional study, greater relative grip strength was associated with a lower prevalence of T2DM independent of BMI in Korean adults. Additional prospective studies are needed to determine whether a causal association exists between relative grip strength and T2DM prevalence considering BMI."
https://openalex.org/W3195891659,"Surgical Site Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among operated patients. In spite of the accessibility of universal and national guidelines for surgical prophylaxis, recent studies surveying the present routine of prophylaxis have demonstrated overutilization of a wide range antibacterial medication for a single patient. Few studies have shown qualitatively factors influencing this and perceptions of surgeons on surgical antibiotic prophylaxis use. Unfortunately, none of these studies have been done in Tanzania.To describe the perceptions of surgeons on surgical antibiotic prophylaxis use at an urban tertiary hospital.A qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with surgeons was conducted in English by the primary investigator. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Systematic text condensation by Malterud was used for data analysis.Fourteen surgeons and obstetrics and gynaecologists participated. Their perceptions were summarized into three main categories: Inadequate data to support practice; one who sees the patient decides the antibiotic prophylaxis; prolonged antibiotic use for fear of unknown. The participants perceived that choice of antibiotic should be based on local hospital data for bacterial resistance pattern, however the hospital guidelines and data for surgical site infection rates are unknown. Fear of getting infection and anticipating complications led to prolonged antibiotics use.The study provides an understanding of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis use and its implementation challenges. This was partly expressed by unavailability of local data and guidelines to enhance practice. To improve this, there is a need of guidelines that incorporates local resistance surveillance data and enhanced antibiotic stewardship programmes. A strong consideration should be placed into ways to combat the fears of surgeons for complications, as these significantly affect the current practise with use of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis."
https://openalex.org/W3193683672,"To measure needle insertion force and change in intraocular pressure (IOP) in real-time during intravitreal injection (IVI). The effects of needle size, insertion speed, and injection rate to IOP change were investigated.Needle insertion and fluid injection were performed on 90 porcine eyeballs using an automatic IVI device. The IVI conditions were divided according to needle sizes of 27-gauge (G), 30G, and 33G; insertion speeds of 1, 2, and 5 mm/s; and injection rates of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05 mL/s. Insertion force and IOP were measured in real-time using a force sensor and a pressure transducer.The peak IOP was observed when the needle penetrated the sclera; the average IOP elevation was 96.3, 67.1, and 59.4 mmHg for 27G, 30G, and 33G needles, respectively. An increase in insertion speed caused IOP elevation at the moment of penetration, but this effect was reduced as needle size decreased: 109.8-85.9 mmHg in 27G for 5-1 mm/s (p = 0.0149) and 61.8-60.7 mmHg in 33G for 5-1 mm/s (p = 0.8979). Injection speed was also related to IOP elevation during the stage of drug injection: 16.65 and 11.78 mmHg for injection rates of 0.05 and 0.01 mL/s (p < 0.001).The presented data offers an understanding of IOP changes during each step of IVI. Slow needle insertion can reduce IOP elevation when using a 27G needle. Further, the injection rate must be kept low to avoid IOP elevations during the injection stage."
https://openalex.org/W3194038920,"To develop an index assessing the risks of low energy fractures (LEF) in patients prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AED) by exploring five previously suggested risk factors; age, gender, AED-type, epilepsy diagnosis and BMI.In a population-based retrospective open cohort study we used real world data from the Electronic Health Register (EHR) in Region Kalmar County, Sweden. 23 209 patients prescribed AEDs at any time from January 2008 to November 2018 and 23 281 matching controls were followed from first registration in the EHR until the first documented LEF, disenrollment (or death) or until the end of the study period, whichever came first. Risks of LEF measured as hazard rate ratios in relation to the suggested risk factors and in comparison to matched controls were analyzed using Cox regression. The index was developed using a linear combination of the statistically significant variables multiplied by the corresponding regression coefficients.Data from 23 209 patients prescribed AEDs and 2084 documented LEFs during a follow-up time of more than 10 years resulted in the Kalmar Epilepsy Fracture Risk Index (KEFRI). KEFRI = Age-category x (1.18) + Gender x (-0.51) + AED-type x (0.29) + Epilepsy diagnosis-category x (0.31) + BMI-category x (-0.35). All five previously suggested risk factors were confirmed. Women aged 75 years and older treated with an inducing AED against epilepsy and BMIs of 25 kg/m2 or below had 48 times higher LEF rates compared to men aged 50 years or younger, treated with a non-inducing AED for a condition other than epilepsy and BMIs above 25 kg/m2.The KEFRI is the first weighted multifactorial assessment tool estimating risks of LEF in patients prescribed AEDs and could serve as a feasible guide within clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3194368625,"Incomplete remyelination is frequent in multiple sclerosis (MS)-lesions, but there is no established marker for recent remyelination. We investigated the role of the oligodendrocyte/myelin protein ermin in de- and remyelination in the cuprizone (CPZ) mouse model, and in MS. The density of ermin+ oligodendrocytes in the brain was significantly decreased after one week of CPZ exposure (p < 0.02). The relative proportion of ermin+ cells compared to cells positive for the late-stage oligodendrocyte marker Nogo-A increased at the onset of remyelination in the corpus callosum (p < 0.02). The density of ermin-positive cells increased in the corpus callosum during the CPZ-phase of extensive remyelination (p < 0.0001). In MS, the density of ermin+ cells was higher in remyelinated lesion areas compared to non-remyelinated areas both in white- (p < 0.0001) and grey matter (p < 0.0001) and compared to normal-appearing white matter (p < 0.001). Ermin immunopositive cells in MS-lesions were not immunopositive for the early-stage oligodendrocyte markers O4 and O1, but a subpopulation was immunopositive for Nogo-A. The data suggest a relatively higher proportion of ermin immunopositivity in oligodendrocytes compared to Nogo-A indicates recent or ongoing remyelination."
https://openalex.org/W3194774403,"Studies on the large-scale latitudinal patterns of gastropod drilling predation reveal that predation pressure may decrease or increase with increasing latitude, or even show no trend, questioning the generality of any large-scale latitudinal or biogeographic pattern. Here, we analyze the nature of spatio-environmental and latitudinal variation in gastropod drilling along the Indian eastern coast by using 76 samples collected from 39 locations, covering ~2500 km, incorporating several ecoregions, and ~15° latitudinal extents. We find no environmental or latitudinal gradient. In fact, drilling intensity varies highly within the same latitudinal bin, or oceanic sub-basins, or even the same ecoregions. Moreover, different ecoregions with their distinctive biotic and abiotic environmental variables show similar predation intensities. However, one pattern is prevalent: some small infaunal prey taxa, living in the sandy-muddy substrate-which are preferred by the naticid gastropods-are always attacked more frequently over others, indicating taxon and size selectivity by the predators. The result suggests that the biotic and abiotic factors, known to influence drilling predation, determine only the local predation pattern. In the present case, the nature of substrate and prey composition determines the local predation intensity: soft substrate habitats host dominantly small, infaunal prey. Since the degree of spatial variability in drilling intensity within any time bin can be extremely high, sometimes greater than the variability across consecutive time bins, temporal patterns in drilling predation can never be interpreted without having detailed knowledge of the nature of this spatial variability within a time bin."
https://openalex.org/W3194692573,"The process of integrating observations into a numerical model of an evolving dynamical system, known as data assimilation, has become an essential tool in computational science. These methods, however, are computationally expensive as they typically involve large matrix multiplication and inversion. Furthermore, it is challenging to incorporate a constraint into the procedure, such as requiring a positive state vector. Here we introduce an entirely new approach to data assimilation, one that satisfies an information measure and uses the unnormalized Kullback-Leibler divergence, rather than the standard choice of Euclidean distance. Two sequential data assimilation algorithms are presented within this framework and are demonstrated numerically. These new methods are solved iteratively and do not require an adjoint. We find them to be computationally more efficient than Optimal Interpolation (3D-Var solution) and the Kalman filter whilst maintaining similar accuracy. Furthermore, these Kullback-Leibler data assimilation (KL-DA) methods naturally embed constraints, unlike Kalman filter approaches. They are ideally suited to systems that require positive valued solutions as the KL-DA guarantees this without need of transformations, projections, or any additional steps. This Kullback-Leibler framework presents an interesting new direction of development in data assimilation theory. The new techniques introduced here could be developed further and may hold potential for applications in the many disciplines that utilize data assimilation, especially where there is a need to evolve variables of large-scale systems that must obey physical constraints."
https://openalex.org/W3195525275,"Changes in renal function in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients receiving direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are controversial. The evolution of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in these patients remains unclear.A total of 232 CHC patients receiving DAA at Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital from May 2016 to February 2019, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Grade 2/3 renal function deterioration, defined as a decrease in eGFR between 10% and 50% from baseline (BL) to 12 weeks after the end of treatment (P12), was investigated for its association with BL characteristics. The changes in renal function and NGAL levels were also analyzed at the SOF-base or nonSOF-base DAA.Sixty-two patients (26.7%) had grade 2/3 renal function deterioration at P12 after DAA therapy. Univariate analysis showed that it was associated with age (P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis indicated that age (OR = 1.033, 95% CI: 1.004-1.064, P = 0.027), sex (male; OR = 2.039, 95% CI: 1.093-3.804, P = 0.025), ACEI/ARB use (OR = 2.493, 95% CI: 1.016-6.119, P = 0.046), and BL NGAL (OR = 1.033, 95% CI: 1.001-1.067, P = 0.046) positively correlated with grade 2/3 renal function deterioration. Furthermore, eGFR was decreased (P = 0.009) and NGAL was increased (P = 0.004) from BL to P12 in CHC patients receiving SOF-based DAA.Of the CHC patients receiving DAA therapy, 26.7% had grade 2/3 renal function deterioration at P12, and it was associated with older age, gender being male, ACEI/ARB use, and higher BL NGAL levels. In addition, NGAL might be a biomarker of nephrotoxicity at P12 in patients receiving SOF-based DAA."
https://openalex.org/W3195802156,"Little attention has been given to the effect of positional variation of gene expression in the mammary gland. However, more research is shedding light regarding the physiological differences that mammary gland location can have on the murine mammary gland. Here we examined the differentially expressed genes between mammary gland positions under either a low-fat diet (LFD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) in the mid-lactation mammary gland (lactation day 11; L11). Three-week old WT C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to either a low-fat diet (LFD) or high fat diet (HFD) (n = 3/group) and either the right thoracic mammary gland (TMG) or inguinal mammary gland (IMG) was collected from each dam for a total of 12 unique glands. Within each diet, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were first filtered by adjusted p-value (cutoff ≤ 0.05) and fold-change (FC, cutoff ≥2). Genes were further filtered by mean normalized read count with a cutoff≥10. We observed that mammary gland position had a significant impact on mammary gland gene expression with either LFD or HFD diet, with 1264 DEGs in LFD dams and 777 DEGs in HFD dams. We found that genes related to snRNP binding and translation initiation were most significantly altered between the TMG and IMG. Although we were not able to discern a molecular mechanism, many small nuclear RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs were differentially expressed between the TMG and IMG responsible for cellular functions such as splicing and ribosome biogenesis, which provides and interesting avenue for future research. Our study supports the hypothesis that collection of the mammary gland from a particular location influences mammary gland gene expression, thereby highlighting the importance for researchers to be vigilant in documenting and reporting which mammary gland they are using for their studies."
https://openalex.org/W3196241036,"In this paper we propose a new method of eliciting market research information. Instead of asking respondents for their personal choices and preferences, we ask respondents to predict the choices of other respondents to the survey. Such predictions tap respondents’ knowledge of peers, whether based on direct social contacts or on more general cultural information. The effectiveness of this approach has already been demonstrated in the context of political polling. Here we extend it to market research, specifically, to conjoint analysis. An advantage of the new approach is that it can elicit reliable responses in situations where people are not comfortable with disclosing their true preferences, but may be willing to give information about people around them. A theoretical argument demonstrates that predictions should yield utility estimates that are more accurate. These theoretical results are confirmed in four online experiments."
