https://openalex.org/W2110817748,"Cellular responses to DNA damage are mediated by a number of protein kinases, including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related). The outlines of the signal transduction portion of this pathway are known, but little is known about the physiological scope of the DNA damage response (DDR). We performed a large-scale proteomic analysis of proteins phosphorylated in response to DNA damage on consensus sites recognized by ATM and ATR and identified more than 900 regulated phosphorylation sites encompassing over 700 proteins. Functional analysis of a subset of this data set indicated that this list is highly enriched for proteins involved in the DDR. This set of proteins is highly interconnected, and we identified a large number of protein modules and networks not previously linked to the DDR. This database paints a much broader landscape for the DDR than was previously appreciated and opens new avenues of investigation into the responses to DNA damage in mammals."

In a living Escherichia coli cell, we directly observed specific binding of a lac repressor, labeled with a fluorescent protein, to a chromosomal lac operator. Using single-molecule detection techniques, we measured the kinetics of binding and dissociation of the repressor in response to metabolic signals. Furthermore, we characterized the nonspecific binding to DNA, one-dimensional (1D) diffusion along DNA segments, and 3D translocation among segments through cytoplasm at the single-molecule level. In searching for the operator, a lac repressor spends ∼90% of time nonspecifically bound to and diffusing along DNA with a residence time of &lt;5 milliseconds. The methods and findings can be generalized to other nucleic acid binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2134311770,"The industrially important coupling of aromatic compounds has generally required differential prefunctionalization of the arene coupling partners with a halide and an electropositive group. Here we report that palladium, in conjunction with a copper oxidant, can catalyze the cross-coupling of N -acetylindoles and benzenes in high yield and high regioselectivity across a range of indoles without recourse to activating groups. These reactions are completely selective for arene cross-coupling, with no products arising from indole or benzene homo-coupling detected by spectroscopic analysis. This efficient reactivity should be useful in the design of other oxidative arene cross-couplings as well."

We uncovered the atomic arrangement by real-space modeling of the pair distribution function (PDF) derived from direct Fourier transformation of the total x-ray scattering. The PDF for ferrihydrite synthesized with the use of different routes is consistent with a single phase (hexagonal space group P 6 3 mc ; a = ∼5.95 angstroms, c = ∼9.06 angstroms). In its ideal form, this structure contains 20% tetrahedrally and 80% octahedrally coordinated iron and has a basic structural motif closely related to the Baker-Figgis δ-Keggin cluster. Real-space fitting indicates structural relaxation with decreasing particle size and also suggests that second-order effects such as internal strain, stacking faults, and particle shape contribute to the PDFs."
https://openalex.org/W1989800108,"The BRCT repeats of the breast and ovarian cancer predisposition protein BRCA1 are essential for tumor suppression. Phosphopeptide affinity proteomic analysis identified a protein, Abraxas, that directly binds the BRCA1 BRCT repeats through a phospho-Ser-X-X-Phe motif. Abraxas binds BRCA1 to the mutual exclusion of BACH1 (BRCA1-associated C-terminal helicase) and CtIP (CtBP-interacting protein), forming a third type of BRCA1 complex. Abraxas recruits the ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)-containing protein RAP80 to BRCA1. Both Abraxas and RAP80 were required for DNA damage resistance, G(2)-M checkpoint control, and DNA repair. RAP80 was required for optimal accumulation of BRCA1 on damaged DNA (foci) in response to ionizing radiation, and the UIM domains alone were capable of foci formation. The RAP80-Abraxas complex may help recruit BRCA1 to DNA damage sites in part through recognition of ubiquitinated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1968943627,"Mutations affecting the BRCT domains of the breast cancer–associated tumor suppressor BRCA1 disrupt the recruitment of this protein to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The molecular structures at DSBs recognized by BRCA1 are presently unknown. We report the interaction of the BRCA1 BRCT domain with RAP80, a ubiquitin-binding protein. RAP80 targets a complex containing the BRCA1-BARD1 (BRCA1-associated ring domain protein 1) E3 ligase and the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) BRCC36 to MDC1-γH2AX–dependent lysine 6 - and lysine 63 -linked ubiquitin polymers at DSBs. These events are required for cell cycle checkpoint and repair responses to ionizing radiation, implicating ubiquitin chain recognition and turnover in the BRCA1-mediated repair of DSBs."
https://openalex.org/W2008396969,"Mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 ( BRCA1 ) are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA1 participates in the cellular DNA damage response. We report the identification of receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80) as a BRCA1-interacting protein in humans. RAP80 contains a tandem ubiquitin-interacting motif domain, which is required for its binding with ubiquitin in vitro and its damage-induced foci formation in vivo. Moreover, RAP80 specifically recruits BRCA1 to DNA damage sites and functions with BRCA1 in G 2 /M checkpoint control. Together, these results suggest the existence of a ubiquitination-dependent signaling pathway involved in the DNA damage response."

On-demand single-electron injection in a quantum conductor was obtained using a quantum dot connected to the conductor via a tunnel barrier. Electron emission was triggered by the application of a potential step that compensated for the dot-charging energy. Depending on the barrier transparency, the quantum emission time ranged from 0.1 to 10 nanoseconds. The single-electron source should prove useful for the use of quantum bits in ballistic conductors. Additionally, periodic sequences of single-electron emission and absorption generate a quantized alternating current."
https://openalex.org/W1967910172,"The roles of endocannabinoid signaling during central nervous system development are unknown. We report that CB 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB 1 Rs) are enriched in the axonal growth cones of γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) interneurons in the rodent cortex during late gestation. Endocannabinoids trigger CB 1 R internalization and elimination from filopodia and induce chemorepulsion and collapse of axonal growth cones of these GABAergic interneurons by activating RhoA. Similarly, endocannabinoids diminish the galvanotropism of Xenopus laevis spinal neurons. These findings, together with the impaired target selection of cortical GABAergic interneurons lacking CB 1 Rs, identify endocannabinoids as axon guidance cues and demonstrate that endocannabinoid signaling regulates synaptogenesis and target selection in vivo."

By the age of 8 months, only bilingual (French-English) infants succeed at this task. These findings reveal a surprisingly early preparedness for visual language discrimination and highlight infants' selectivity for retaining only necessary perceptual sensitivities."
https://openalex.org/W2015516003,"To understand the constraints on biological diversity, we analyzed how selection and development interact to control the evolution of inflorescences, the branching structures that bear flowers. We show that a single developmental model accounts for the restricted range of inflorescence types observed in nature and that this model is supported by molecular genetic studies. The model predicts associations between inflorescence architecture, climate, and life history, which we validated empirically. Paths, or evolutionary wormholes, link different architectures in a multidimensional fitness space, but the rate of evolution along these paths is constrained by genetic and environmental factors, which explains why some evolutionary transitions are rare between closely related plant taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2081719540,"Identifying the properties of gene networks that influence their evolution is a fundamental research goal. However, modes of evolution cannot be inferred solely from the distribution of natural variation, because selection interacts with demography and mutation rates to shape polymorphism and divergence. We estimated the effects of naturally occurring mutations on gene expression while minimizing the effect of natural selection. We demonstrate that sensitivity of gene expression to mutations increases with both increasing trans-mutational target size and the presence of a TATA box. Genes with greater sensitivity to mutations are also more sensitive to systematic environmental perturbations and stochastic noise. These results provide a mechanistic basis for gene expression evolvability that can serve as a foundation for realistic models of regulatory evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2075790601,"Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynecological malignancy in the United States. Although most women present with early disease confined to the uterus, the majority of persistent or recurrent tumors are refractory to current chemotherapies. We have identified a total of 11 different FGFR2 mutations in 3/10 (30%) of endometrial cell lines and 19/187 (10%) of primary uterine tumors. Mutations were seen primarily in tumors of the endometrioid histologic subtype (18/115 cases investigated, 16%). The majority of the somatic mutations identified were identical to germline activating mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 that cause Apert Syndrome, Beare-Stevenson Syndrome, hypochondroplasia, achondroplasia and SADDAN syndrome. The two most common somatic mutations identified were S252W (in eight tumors) and N550K (in five samples). Four novel mutations were identified, three of which are also likely to result in receptor gain-of-function. Extensive functional analyses have already been performed on many of these mutations, demonstrating they result in receptor activation through a variety of mechanisms. The discovery of activating FGFR2 mutations in endometrial carcinoma raises the possibility of employing anti-FGFR molecularly targeted therapies in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2042562529,"The advent of biotechnology-derived, herbicide-resistant crops has revolutionized farming practices in many countries. Facile, highly effective, environmentally sound, and profitable weed control methods have been rapidly adopted by crop producers who value the benefits associated with biotechnology-derived weed management traits. But a rapid rise in the populations of several troublesome weeds that are tolerant or resistant to herbicides currently used in conjunction with herbicide-resistant crops may signify that the useful lifetime of these economically important weed management traits will be cut short. We describe the development of soybean and other broadleaf plant species resistant to dicamba, a widely used, inexpensive, and environmentally safe herbicide. The dicamba resistance technology will augment current herbicide resistance technologies and extend their effective lifetime. Attributes of both nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded dicamba resistance genes that affect the potency and expected durability of the herbicide resistance trait are examined."

https://openalex.org/W2014422314,"Metformin is one of the most commonly used first line drugs for type II diabetes. Metformin lowers serum glucose levels by activating 5′-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which maintains energy homeostasis by directly sensing the AMP/ATP ratio. AMPK plays a central role in food intake and energy metabolism through its activities in central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Since food intake and energy metabolism is synchronized to the light-dark (LD) cycle of the environment, we investigated the possibility that AMPK may affect circadian rhythm. We discovered that the circadian period of Rat-1 fibroblasts treated with metformin was shortened by 1 h. One of the regulators of the period length is casein kinase Iɛ (CKIɛ), which by phosphorylating and inducing the degradation of the circadian clock component, mPer2, shortens the period length. AMPK phosphorylates Ser-389 of CKIɛ, resulting in increased CKIɛ activity and degradation of mPer2. In peripheral tissues, injection of metformin leads to mPer2 degradation and a phase advance in the circadian expression pattern of clock genes in wild-type mice but not in AMPK α2 knock-out mice.

Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar). The SCN neurons, cued by the LD cycle, orchestrate the circadian rhythms of peripheral clocks that reside in most cells of the body. The pacemaker, both in the SCN and in peripheral tissues, consists of a self-sustaining near 24-h rhythm in the expression of core clock genes. A central component of this pacemaker is the negative-feedback loop, which results from Per and Cry proteins suppressing their own transcription with a precisely timed lag.

Here, we report that metformin and AMPK have a surprising role in modulating the circadian rhythm. We find that CKIɛ is activated by AMPK-dependent phosphorylation and stimulates mPer2 degradation.

Rat-1 cells were then treated with forskolin, and 30 min later, the medium was replaced with the recording medium, containing 10% of fetal bovine serum and HEPES-buffered Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. Luminescence was measured for 6 days by counting the photon every 60 s. The period length was determined with regression analyses by using ClockLab (Actimetrics). Four to six peaks detected from the baseline-subtracted data (the baseline drift determined by an adjacent averaging method with 24 h was corrected by subtracting it from the original data) were used for the period determination. A more detailed description of this technique has been previously published (19Yamazaki S. Takahashi J.S. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 393: 288-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Mice—Animals were maintained in barrier facilities with sterile food, water, and bedding on a 12-h light/dark (6 a.m./6 p.m.) cycle and were allowed free access to food. All experiments were approved by NHLBI Animal Care and Use Committee. In Vitro AMPK Kinase Assay—GST-CKIɛ fusion protein fragments and mutants were expressed and purified using the GST purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. Reactions (20 μl) were performed in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij-35 with or without 300 μm AMP and 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with 50 milliunits of AMPK (Millipore) and 2 μgof GST-CKIɛ fusion protein substrates. The mixture was incubated 30 °C for 20 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assay—Myc-tagged CKIɛ, transiently expressed in 293T cells, was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody and 10 μl of protein A-agarose beads in 200 μl of total volume overnight after preclearing the lysates with protein A-agarose beads for 2 hat 4°C. For the kinase reaction, a His-tagged mPer2 (amino acids 550–763) fragment was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli. Kinase reactions were performed as described previously (3Camacho F.

In Vivo 32P Labeling Assay—V5-tagged CKIɛ fragment 2 and its S389A mutant were transiently expressed in 293T cells as described above. 36 h after transfection, cells were preincubated with phosphate-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 1 h and labeled with 500 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, after which they were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein were precleared by incubating them with protein A-agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C. The samples were immunoprecipitated with V5 antibody and protein A-agarose bead overnight at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed four times with the cell lysis buffer and dissolved in SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Since food intake and energy metabolism are synchronized to the LD cycle, we suspected that some pathways regulated by food intake and energy metabolism may affect the circadian rhythm. Since AMPK plays a central role in food intake and energymetabolism, weinvestigatedthepossibilitythatanAMPK-dependent pathway can affect circadian rhythm. The ability to visualize circadian oscillations of gene expression in vitro has been facilitated by the development of a cell culture-based luminescent reporter assay that can monitor the expression levels of the reporter in real time (20Izumo M. Johnson C.H. Yamazaki S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16089-16094Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To monitor the circadian variation in the activity of the mPer2 promoter, we used Rat-1 fibroblasts that have been stably transfected with an mPer2-luciferase reporter. After these cells were synchronized with forskolin (21Balsalobre A. Marcacci L. Schibler U. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1291-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), we treated them with metformin and monitored the luciferase activity in real-time. As shown in Fig. 1, metformin shortened the period length by approximately 1 h(p < 0.01). Since proteasomal degradation of mPer2 that is stimulated by CKIɛ phosphorylation can shorten the circadian period length (4Eide E.J. Woolf M.F. Kang H. Woolf P. Hurst W. Camacho F. Vielhaber E.L. Giovanni A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2795-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that AMPK regulated the period length by stimulating CKIɛ-mediated degradation of mPer2. To do this, we transiently transfected NIH3T3 cells with expression vectors for V5-tagged mPer2 and either CKIɛ or dominant-negative CKIɛ (K38R) and treated them with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) (22Sullivan J.E. Brocklehurst K.J. Marley A.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), an activator of AMPK. As shown in Fig. 2A, mPer2 protein levels decreased dramatically in the presence of CKIɛ, but this was blocked by dominant-negative CKIɛ (K38R), suggesting that AICAR treatment decreased mPer2 levels in a CKIɛ-dependent manner. To demonstrate that the reduction in mPer2 levels was caused by AMPK activation, we overexpressed constitutively active (CA) AMPKα2 and dominant-negative (DN) AMPKα2 in HeLa cells by infecting them with adenovirus carrying the expression vector for CA AMPK or DN AMPK. The levels of transiently expressed V5-mPer2 were significantly reduced by infection with CA AMPK adenovirus but were increased by infection with DN AMPK adenovirus (Fig. 2B). To further establish that activation of AMPK reduces mPer2 levels, we examined AMPK-dependent reduction in mPer2 level using murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) developed from AMPKα1/α2 double KO and WT embryos (23Laderoute K.R. Amin K. Calaoagan J.M. Knapp M. Le T. Orduna J. Foretz M. Viollet B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5336-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, activation of AMPK with metformin reduced mPer2 levels in WT MEFs but not in AMPKα1/α2 double KO MEFs. Activation of AMPK with metformin also reduced mPer1 levels in WT MEFs but not in AMPKα1/α2 double KO MEF (data not shown). To demonstrate that AMPK reduced mPer2 levels through proteasome-dependent degradation, we repeated the experiment shown in Fig. 2B in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2D). Indeed, MG132 blocked the reduction of mPer2 level induced by CA AMPK. Consistent with this, AICAR-induced reduction in mPer2 level was also blocked with MG132 (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these results suggest that activation of AMPK induces CKIɛ-mediated degradation of mPer2 by proteasome. We investigated whether AMPK stimulated CKIɛ-mediated degradation of mPer2 by directly phosphorylating CKIɛ. To test this possibility, we performed in vitro kinase reactions using fragments F1 (aa residues 1–230) and F2 (aa 211–416) of CKIɛ as AMPK substrates (Fig. 3A). AMPK did not phosphorylate F1 but did phosphorylate F2 very strongly in an AMP-dependent manner. In vitro kinase assays using fragments derived from F2 as sub-strates of AMPK indicated that the AMPK phosphorylation site resides in aa 377–404 near the C terminus of CKIɛ (Fig. 3B). Examination of the amino acid sequence in this region revealed that Ser-389 is part of a motif that resembles the consensus AMPK phosphorylation site ((S/T)XXXL) (Fig. 3C). Ser-389 and the sequence surrounding it are highly conserved in all vertebrate CKIɛ, including that of chicken and frog, and also in CKIδ. To test whether Ser-389 could be the AMPK phosphorylation site, we used F2 containing a Ser-389 → Ala mutation (S389A) as the AMPK substrate in a kinase reaction. The S389A mutation almost completely abolished AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), suggesting that in vitro, Ser-389 is the primary AMPK phosphorylation site in CKIɛ. To determine whether Ser-389 is phosphorylated in vivo, we transiently expressed F2 and F2 (S389A) in 293T cells and incubated them with [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free medium. Because phosphate-free medium activated AMPK by decreasing ATP (Fig. 3D, top), we did not treat cells with an AMPK activator. As shown in Fig. 3D (bottom), the S389A mutation dramatically decreased 32P labeling of CKIɛ in cells, indicating that Ser-389 is phosphorylated in vivo. To determine the role of Ser-389 on CKIɛ activity, we immunoprecipitated CKIɛ containing the S389A mutation and performed a kinase reaction using mPer2 as substrate (Fig. 3E). Although the basal activity of CKIɛ (S389A) was similar to that of CKIɛ, the activity of CKIɛ (S389A) did not change with AICAR treatment, whereas the activity of CKIɛ consistently increased by about 3-fold within 2 h of AICAR treatment (p < 0.05). If activation of AMPK stimulates mPer2 degradation by phosphorylating Ser-389 of CKIɛ, mPer2 degradation should be blocked in S389A mutant. Indeed, AICAR-induced degradation of mPer2 did not occur when CKIɛ (S389A) was overexpressed (Fig. 3F). The activity of the endogenous CKIɛ immunoprecipitated from Rat-1 fibroblasts (Fig. 1) was also increased after metformin treatment (Fig. 3G), and mPer2 in Rat-1 fibroblasts was degraded after metformin treatment (Fig. 3H). Since the oscillation in mPer mRNA expression results from mPer proteins suppressing their transcription through negative feedback, degradation of mPer2 during the period when mPer2 transcription is increasing should cause the mPer2 mRNA level to rise faster and peak earlier. To test this possibility, we injected WT mice with metformin, which has a short half-life (2.7 h) in mice (24Junien J.L. Brohon J. Guillaume M. Sterne J. Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther. 1979; 241: 165-176PubMed Google Scholar), at 8 a.m. and measured mRNA levels of core clock genes mPer1, mPer2, Clock, and Bmal1 at 8 a.m. (no injection), 1 p.m., 6 p.m., 10 p.m., 2 a.m., and 7 a.m. in the heart, skeletal muscle, and fat. Consistent with our earlier results, metformin injection induced AMPK activity and led to mPer2 degradation (Fig. 4A). Since metformin injection causes transient hypoglycemia, we also injected insulin to another group to evaluate the effect of hypoglycemia alone. Metformin and insulin both decreased serum glucose by ∼40% after 1 h (data not shown). The peak mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA levels in heart occurred at 6 p.m. in saline- and insulin-injected mice, but it occurred at 1 p.m. in metformin-injected mice (Fig. 4B). The expression patterns of Bmal1 and Clock mRNA were also shifted forward in the tissues of metformin-injected mice (Fig. 4B). Phase advance was also induced in skeletal muscle (Fig. 4C) and fat (data not shown). To determine whether AMPKα2 was required for the metformin-induced phase advance, we performed these experiments in AMPKα2 KO mice. As shown in Fig. 4D, the levels of mPer2 protein in AMPKα2 KO mice were higher when compared with WT mice but did not change with metformin injection. Moreover, metformin injection did not significantly alter mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA expression patterns in AMPKα2 KO mice as it did in WT mice (p = 0.2–0.9 between saline- and metformin-injected samples) (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that metformin-induced mPer2 degradation and phase advance were mediated primarily by AMPKα2. In summary, we provide evidence that activation of AMPK can modulate the circadian rhythm by targeting the CKIɛ-mPer pathway. From what is known about metformin or AMPK, their linkage to the CKIɛ-mPer pathway and circadian rhythm was unexpected. However, previous work has shown that altering the eating behavior affects the circadian rhythm. For example, leptin-deficient mice, which overeat and develop morbid obesity, have altered sleep regulation and circadian rhythmicity (25Laposky A.D. Shelton J. Bass J. Dugovic C. Perrino N. Turek F.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290 (–R903): R894Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, locomotor activity and the circadian clock in the peripheral tissues can be entrained by feeding (26Stokkan K.A. Yamazaki S. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Menaker M. Science. 2001; 291: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to test whether AMPK functions as the feeding sensor for this type of entrainment. Although metformin caused a dramatic shift in the circadian phase in the peripheral tissues, we have not been able to demonstrate that the circadian rhythm of behavior can be shifted by metformin because metformin does not cross the blood brain barrier. However, our work provides a proof of principle that chemical manipulation of the circadian phase, at least in the peripheral tissues, may be possible.

https://openalex.org/W2056383496,"In a conventional class I ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a diiron(II/II) cofactor in the R2 subunit reacts with oxygen to produce a diiron(III/IV) intermediate, which generates a stable tyrosyl radical (Y⚫). The Y⚫ reversibly oxidizes a cysteine residue in the R1 subunit to a cysteinyl radical (C⚫), which abstracts the 3′-hydrogen of the substrate to initiate its reduction. The RNR from Chlamydia trachomatis lacks the Y⚫, and it had been proposed that the diiron(III/IV) complex in R2 directly generates the C⚫ in R1. By enzyme activity measurements and spectroscopic methods, we show that this RNR actually uses a previously unknown stable manganese(IV)/iron(III) cofactor for radical initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2044559213,"Transcription factor Oct4 is a master regulator affecting the fate of pluripotent stem cells and germ cell precursors. Oct4 expression is tightly regulated, and small changes in expression level can have dramatic effects on differentiation or oncogenesis. Post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and ubiquitination have been reported to regulate Oct4 transcriptional activity. Here we show that Oct4 is a target for small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-1 modification <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Sumoylation of Oct4 occurs at a single lysine, Lys<sup>118</sup>, located at the end of the amino-terminal transactivation domain and next to the Pit1-Oct-Unc86 (POU) DNA binding domain. SUMO-1 and Oct4 colocalize at several promoter sequences <i>in vivo</i>, and a fraction of Oct4 molecules colocalized with SUMO-1 in nuclear aggregates. Sumoylation of Oct4 led to significantly increased Oct4 stability and increased DNA binding. In addition, SUMO-1 cotransfection led to augmented Oct4 transactivation potential that was reduced when the Oct4 sumoylation target site was mutated. Therefore, sumoylation of Oct4 results in increased stability, DNA binding, and transactivation and provides an important mechanism to regulate Oct4 activity."

Upon infection, the host detects an invading pathogen through pattern recognition receptors such as the toll-like receptors or the cytoplasmic receptors RIG-I and Mda-5. Depending on the microbial pathogen, distinct signaling pathways are triggered, many of which lead to activation of IRF-3.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).

The crystal structure of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain bound to the interferon-β promoter and the crystal structure of the IAD have been determined (14Panne D. Maniatis T. Harrison S.C.

Activation of IRF-3 requires phosphorylation on a cluster of serine and threonine residues in the C-terminal region of the IAD spanning amino acids 385 to 405. Despite considerable efforts, using mutagenesis, phosphopeptide mapping, and phospho-specific antibodies, the exact position and role of phosphorylation sites in the 385-405 region remain controversial. On the one hand, Fujita and co-workers (17Mori M. Yoneyama M. Ito T. Takahashi K. Inagaki F. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9698-9702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) suggest that phosphorylation at Ser385/Ser386 (site 1) is key to the activation of IRF-3 and that phosphorylation at site 2, spanning residues 396 to 405, has an auxiliary but not essential role. This view is supported by the observation that mutation of Ser385 or Ser386 to Ala abolishes IRF-3 activity (5Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 12Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T.

On the other hand, Hiscott and colleagues (11Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) argue that phosphorylation of site 2 residues may also be critical for virus-inducible IRF-3 activation. For instance, substitutions of the site 2 residues Ser396, Ser398, Ser402, Thr404, and Ser405 with the phosphomimetic Asp or Glu (IRF-3 5E) lead to a constitutive phenotype (11Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Further mutagenesis and use of a phosphospecific antibody has identified Ser396 as a key site 2 residue that is phosphorylated in vivo upon virus infection (18Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. tenOever B.R. Duguay D. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9441-9447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Substitution of Ser385 and Ser386 with either Ala or Asp inhibits IRF-3 activation (5Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data point to a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism of IRF-3 activation that requires serine 386 and a cluster of serine/threonine residues between Ser396 and Ser405. Analysis of the crystal structure of the IAD by Qin et al. (15Qin B.Y. Liu C. Lam S.S. Srinath H. Delston R. Correia J.J. Derynck R. Lin K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) suggested that phosphorylation of the site 2 residues 396-405 results in unfolding of an N-and C-terminal autoinhibitory structure, essentially consistent with the functional studies of Hiscott and colleagues (5Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 18Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. tenOever B.R. Duguay D. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol.

Unfolding of the autoinhibitory structure by introduction of a negative charge, through either phosphorylation or mutagenesis, exposes a hydrophobic surface for interaction with CBP/p300. Qin et al. (15Qin B.Y. Liu C. Lam S.S. Srinath H. Delston R. Correia J.J. Derynck R. Lin K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) also suggested that the dimer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal was not physiologically relevant and that the phosphorylated, rearranged C-terminal tail might be involved in subunit dimerization. In contrast, Takahasi et al. (16Takahasi K. Suzuki N.N. Horiuchi M. Mori M. Suhara W. Okabe Y. Fukuhara Y. Terasawa H. Akira S. Fujita T. Inagaki F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) doubt the existence of the N- and C-terminal autoinhibitory structure and interpret their crystallographic results to be consistent with the functional studies of Fujita and co-workers (12Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). They suggest that the dimer in the asymmetric unit is physiologically relevant and that phosphorylation of Ser385/Ser386 results directly in IAD dimerization. Dimerization would generate a combined surface for recognition of CBP/p300 (16Takahasi K. Suzuki N.N. Horiuchi M. Mori M. Suhara W. Okabe Y. Fukuhara Y. Terasawa H. Akira S. Fujita T. Inagaki F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This latter model was recently ruled out by a co-complex crystal structure of the IAD with the interferon-binding domain (IBiD) of CBP (19Qin B.Y. Liu C. Srinath H. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Derynck R. Lin K. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1269-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This structure shows that removal of the autoinhibitory N and C termini of the IAD leads to exposure of a binding pocket that interacts with IBiD and that the IAD and IBiD form a 1:1 complex. To clarify the role of phosphorylation in IRF-3 activation, as well as the role of TBK1 in this process, we purified to homogeneity full-length IRF-3, the constitutive mutant IRF-3 5E, and the kinase TBK1. We found that, as predicted, purified IRF-3 is a monomer in solution and that IRF-3 5E is a dimer. Access to highly purified and homogeneous protein preparations allowed us to map the phosphorylation sites in more detail. Monomeric IRF-3 is phosphorylated neither at site 1 nor at site 2. Dimeric IRF-3 5E is fully phosphorylated at site 1 (Ser385 or Ser386) as a result of constitutive in vivo phosphorylation by an insect cell kinase. TBK1 can directly phosphorylate IRF-3, resulting in a distribution of monomeric and dimeric IRF-3, consistent with earlier findings (5Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mapping of the phosphorylation sites in a purified TBK1-phosphorylated IRF-3 dimer showed 100% phosphorylation of one serine residue at site 1 (Ser385 or Ser386) and of one serine/threonine residue at site 2 (Thr404 or Ser405). The purified TBK1-phosphorylated IRF-3 monomer is not phosphorylated at site 1; it is fully phosphorylated on one serine at site 2 (Thr404 or Ser405), but mutation of residues 404 and 405 to Ala does not completely abolish in vitro phosphorylation of site 2 residues. We also show that CBP binding requires phosphorylation at site 2, the residues of which are functionally redundant. Thus, modification in site 2 is critical for alleviating autoinhibition, for allowing interaction with CBP, and for facilitating phosphorylation at site 1. Phosphorylation at site 1 leads in turn to IRF-3 dimerization as proposed previously (17Mori M. Yoneyama M. Ito T. Takahashi K. Inagaki F. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9698-9702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Insect Cell Culture and Baculovirus Cultivation—The recombinant baculoviruses were propagated in Sf21 insect cells with Hinks TMN-FH insect cell medium (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences). Virus titration, amplification, and storage were performed as described previously. For production of recombinant IRF-3 and IRF-3 5E, Sf21 insect cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 2.0, maintained in spinner flasks at 28 °C, and harvested by centrifugation at 64 h postinfection. For production of TBK1, Hi5 insect cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus and otherwise treated as described above. Purification of Full-length IRF-3 and IRF-3 5E from Insect Cells—Recombinant baculovirus-infected cell pellets were lysed by freezing and then thawed in equilibration buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. For TBK1 purification, frozen cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cells were homogenized by sonication and the lysate clarified by centrifugation at 180,000 × g for 40 min. The clarified insect cell lysate was incubated with pre-equilibrated Anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) for 1 h and then applied to a 25-ml Econo column (Bio-Rad). The resin was washed with 200 ml of equilibration buffer, and then bound protein was eluted using 0.1 mg/ml triple FLAG peptide (sequence, MDYKDHDADYKDHDIDYKDDDDK) dissolved in equilibration buffer. Fractions were concentrated using a Centricon-plus 30 ultrafiltration unit (Amicon, Inc.) and further purified on a Hi-Load 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The final protein was concentrated to 40 mg/ml for IRF-3, 14 mg/ml for IRF-3 5E, and 2.5 mg/ml for TBK1 in a Centricon-plus 30 ultrafiltration unit; aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by diluting the sample in 10 mm KH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 6 m guanidine HCL and measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient calculated from the amino acid sequence. IRF-3 Phosphorylation with TBK1—600 pmol of IRF-3 was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 24 pmol of TBK1 in a buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm ATP. Analytical Gel Filtration—IRF-3, IRF-3 5E, and IRF-3 phosphorylated by TBK1 were further analyzed, on a Superdex 200 10/300 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The column was calibrated using a set of globular protein standards consisting of thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa) (Bio-Rad). Calibration curves were constructed by plotting Kav versus ln (molecular weight), where Kav equals (Ve - V0)/(Vt - V0). Ve is the measured elution volume of the markers. V0, the void volume of the column, was determined by gel filtration of blue dextran, and Vt, the total column volume, was specified by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). Tryptic Digest—Stocks of trypsin were made from a lyophilized powder (Sigma T-8253) to 10 mg/ml in 1 mm HCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. IRF-3 and IRF-3 5E were diluted to 1.25 mg/ml in 80 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Trypsin was diluted to 0.5 mg/ml before use, and the digest was started by adding 1 μl of protease (ratio of protease:substrate was 1:200) to the mix. At each time point trypsin was inactivated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and EDTA and boiling of the sample for 5 min in SDS loading buffer. The samples were analyzed on a 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE. For Edman sequencing, the protein was transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Coomassie-stained bands were excised and sequenced at the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Samples for analytical ultracentrifugation were dialyzed against 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.25 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) using a 3500 molecular weight cutoff dialysis membrane (Pierce). The dialysis buffer was used as a blank and as diluent for centrifugation. Analytical centrifugation was performed using an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) with an AN-60 Ti rotor. Six-channel cells were used, and data were acquired at a resolution of 0.001 cm with five replicates at a temperature of 4 °C. Absorbance at 280 nm was used to monitor concentration gradients. IRF-3 concentrations were 9, 4.5, and 2 μm, and the speeds were 12,000, 15,000, and 22000 rpm. IRF-3 5E concentrations were 8, 5, and 2 μm, and the concentration distribution was measured at three different rotor speeds, 8,500, 12,000, and 15,000 rpm. Samples were determined to have reached equilibrium when scans taken 4 h apart showed no systematic differences. The protein partial specific volume was calculated from the amino acid composition to 0.7235 ml/g, and solvent density was calculated through summation of the contribution of buffer components to 1.00658 g/cm3 at 4 °C using the program SEDNTERP (www.cauma.uthscsa.edu/software/). Molecular mass was determined using Beckman software provided as an add-on to Origin version 4.1. All nine data sets were analyzed using a global fit procedure based on a model describing an ideal non-interacting single component system, with local parameters for reference concentrations and base-line offsets and global parameters for the molecular weight. Best-fits were determined through visual inspection of the residuals. Assessment of Phosphorylation—10-μg aliquots of each protein were desalted by microbore reverse phase liquid chromatography on a 300A polystyrene-divinylbenzene column. Intact protein phosphorylation load was estimated by ESI ion trap (Bruker-Agilent) and by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry prior to tryptic digestion aided by microwave irradiation (CEM Corp.; 5 min, 50 °C, 25 watts). Individual peptide phosphorylation levels were measured simultaneously by flow injection of the entire desalted tryptic digest and analysis of ESI-FTICR spectra (Bruker 9.4T). The accuracy of this method was confirmed by spiking the tryptic digest with known amounts of two pairs of mono- and diphosphorylated versus nonphosphorylated peptides. Phosphorylation sites were deduced by collision-induced dissociation time-of-flight tandem mass spectroscopy (CID TOF MS/MS; AB 4700). Purification of IBiD and in Vitro Protein Interaction Assay—IBiD was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with an N-terminal His tag. The protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) followed by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. ∼50 mg of purified IBiD was bound to 1 ml of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and excess protein was removed by washing in the same buffer. For each binding reaction 10 μg of each of the different IRF-3 preparations was incubated with 20 μl of IBiD-charged nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin in a total volume of 40 μl. The reaction was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and a 10-μl sample (input) was removed. The beads were collected by a 1-min centrifugation at 500 × g, and a 10-μl sample of the supernatant was taken. The beads were than washed twice with 500 μl of 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, and finally bound protein was eluted by boiling in SDS-loading buffer. The protein samples were resolved on a 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE. Purification of IRF-3, IRF-3 5E, IRF-3 2A, and TBK1—FLAG-tagged IRF-3, the constitutively active mutant IRF-3 5E, the mutant IRF-3 2A (T404A/S405A), and the kinase TBK1 were purified from the supernatant of a freeze-thaw lysate of recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells using a FLAG resin followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S200 column. This procedure yielded about 0.6 mg of IRF-3 or IRF-3 2A, 0.3 mg of IRF-3 5E, and 0.9 mg of TBK1 per liter of insect cell culture. To analyze the effect of TBK1 phosphorylation on IRF-3 in vitro, we incubated TBK1 with IRF-3 or IRF-3 2A and analyzed the products by size exclusion chromatography. IRF-3 has the calculated molecular mass of 48 kDa. As shown in Fig. 1, purified IRF-3 eluted as a single peak with a Kav of 0.41, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 111 kDa. The mutant IRF-3 5E eluted as a single peak with a Kav of 0.24, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 316 kDa. When IRF-3 was preincubated with the kinase TBK1, the protein eluted in two peaks from the column. The first peak had a Kav of 0.41, the same as unphosphorylated IRF-3, and the second peak had a Kav of 0.24, identical to that of IRF-3 5E. SDS-PAGE analysis of the two peaks showed an upward mobility shift in the second peak, indicative of phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus TBK1 phosphorylation of IRF-3 leads to a higher molecular weight species with elution properties similar to those of the constitutively active mutant IRF-3 5E. The mutant IRF-3 2A exhibited identical elution profiles and responsiveness to TBKI phosphorylation as the wild-type protein (data not shown). Analytical Ultracentrifugation of IRF-3 and IRF-3 5E—We performed sedimentation equilibrium experiments on IRF-3 and IRF-3 5E to determine the mass and oligomerization state independently of shape and matrix interactions. Both samples were analyzed at three different starting concentrations and three different rotor speeds. For all nine data sets, absorbance data were monitored at 280 nm and the resulting curves fitted using a nonlinear least-squares algorithm (Fig. 2). For both IRF-3 and IRF-3 5E, the residuals showed random distribution, indicating that the samples contained a single monodisperse species. For IRF-3, the data yielded a molecular mass of 52 ± 2 kDa, close to the calculated molecular mass of 48.2 kDa, showing that IRF-3 is a monomer. For IRF-3 5E, we obtained a molecular mass of 103 ± 2 kDa, about double the mass calculated from the composition. We conclude that IRF-3 5E is a dimer. Mapping of the TBK1 Phosphorylation Sites—As shown in Fig. 1, TBK1 phosphorylation of IRF-3 results in two species, one of which elutes from a size exclusion chromatography column at the same position as dimeric IRF-3 5E. We concluded that TBK1 phosphorylation induces dimerization of IRF-3 in vitro, consistent with earlier findings. Having pure, properly folded, and biochemically homogeneous proteins allowed us to investigate further the role of phosphorylation in IRF-3 activation. We analyzed by mass spectroscopy tryptic peptides from unphosphorylated IRF-3, IRF-3 2A, IRF-3 5E, and TBKI-phosphorylated IRF-3 separated by size exclusion chromatography into the dimeric and monomeric fractions. The constitutively active and dimeric IRF-3 5E was 100% phosphorylated at a site 1 residue (Ser385 or Ser386; our data did not allow us to distinguish which serine). That is, site 1 had been phosphorylated by insect cell kinases prior to purification, and the protein had dimerized. This constitutive phosphorylation was observed only in the context of the 5E mutation, and there was no phosphorylation of insect cell-expressed wild-type IRF-3, all of which was monomeric. We do not know the identity of the relevant insect cell kinase. After phosphorylation by TBK1, all IRF-3 had acquired a phosphate at site 2 (Ser404 or Thr405; our data did not allow us to distinguish which residue). The IRF-3 that remained monomeric (peak at 13.6 ml in Fig. 1) had not been modified at site 1, whereas the IRF-3 that had dimerized (peak at 11.6 ml in Fig. 1) was fully phosphorylated at both sites 1 and 2. To investigate further the role of phosphorylation at Ser404 and Thr405, we mutated these residues to alanine (IRF-3 2A) and repeated the TBK1 kinase assay, gel filtration and phosphate mapping studies. The IRF-3 2A mutant dimerized, and peptide analysis showed that dimerization was dependent on phosphorylation of Ser385 or Ser386 as in the wild-type protein. In addition, we detected in both monomeric and dimeric TBK1-treated IRF-3 2A a single phosphorylation event in one of the three remaining site 2 positions (serine 396, 398, or 402). These data imply that phosphorylation at site 1 leads to dimerization, as both the TBK1 phosphorylation-dependent dimer and the IRF-3 5E dimer have been phosphorylated there. These data also show that phosphorylation at site 1 occurs only when site 2 bears a negative charge either from phosphorylation or from the 5E mutation. We never found a species that had a phosphate at site 1 without either a phosphate or a phosphomimetic at site 2. Finally, we can conclude that TBK1 phosphorylates preferentially at site 2, as this site was fully phosphorylated in both monomer and dimer, whereas only the fraction that had been converted to dimer had a phosphate at site 1 (Fig. 1). Our data indicate that positions in site 2 can be targeted redundantly by TBK1, as mutation of residues 404/405 to Ala did not abolish site 2 phosphorylation. Trypsin Digestion of IRF-3 and IRF-3 5E—The structures of the C-terminal activation domain of IRF-3 in the presence and absence of the IRF-3-binding domain from CBP have been determined previously (15Qin B.Y.

They show that the conformations of the latent, autoinhibited IRF-3 and of the IBiD-bound complex are mutually exclusive. The autoinhibitory helices 1 and 5 must be displaced to expose a hydrophobic pocket containing the helices 3 and 4 that interact with the IBiD. Thus we expect that phosphorylation induces structural rearrangements in the domain, which ultimately allow interaction with IBiD and dimerization. We probed monomeric IRF-3 and dimeric IRF-3 5E by limited proteolysis (Fig. 3) and found that IRF-3 5E is more susceptible than wild type to tryptic digestion. After a 10-min incubation, most of the IRF-3 5E had been digested, whereas only a fraction of wild type had been cleaved at that time point. These data show that latent, autoinhibited IRF-3 is less labile than IRF-3 5E dimer. IRF-3 5E cleavage leads to two major products. N-terminal sequencing showed that the larger product derives from the N terminus of the protein and that the smaller product results from cleavage C-terminal to Arg194 (N-terminal LLVPGE). Limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry indicated that this fragment was further cleaved at residue 409, resulting in a stable proteolytic fragment comprising amino acids 195-409. Cleavage sites 195 and 409 are within autoinhibitory helices 1 and 5, respectively. In contrast, proteolytic cleavage of wild-type IRF-3 displayed"
https://openalex.org/W2076362310,"The ubiquitin-specific protease HAUSP is a critical component of the p53-Mdm2 pathway by acting as a specific deubiquitinase for both p53 and Mdm2. Recent structural studies have indicated that p53 and Mdm2 bind to the N-terminal TRAF-like domain of HAUSP in a mutually exclusive manner. To understand the mechanism of HAUSP-mediated effects, we have created a p53 mutant that lacks HAUSP binding based on the crystal structure analysis. Indeed, this mutant p53 protein can be degraded by Mdm2 but fails to interact with HAUSP both in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, however, we have found that direct interaction between HAUSP and p53 is not absolutely required for it to antagonize efficiently Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 and that HAUSP is capable of enzymatically functioning in trans on p53 by using Mdm2 as a bridge. Further, we show that a trimeric protein complex containing p53, Mdm2 and HAUSP can exist in vivo, despite mutually exclusive binding, with Mdm2 serving as a binding mediator for p53 and HAUSP. These findings reveal the complication of HAUSP-mediated effects in the p53-Mdm2 interplay. It also has important implications for the development of novel chemotherapeutic compounds aimed at blocking this protein-protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2017890634,"Myosin V is a molecular motor that moves cargo along actin filaments. Its two heads, each attached to a long and relatively stiff neck, move alternately forward in a ""hand-over-hand"" fashion. To observe under a microscope how the necks move, we attached a micrometer-sized rod to one of the necks. The leading neck swings unidirectionally forward, whereas the trailing neck, once lifted, undergoes extensive Brownian rotation in all directions before landing on a site ahead of the leading head. The neck-neck joint is essentially free, and the neck motion supports a mechanism where the active swing of the leading neck biases the random motion of the lifted head to let it eventually land on a forward site."
https://openalex.org/W2009776832,"FDH (10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase) is strongly downregulated in tumors while its elevation suppresses proliferation of cancer cells and induces p53-dependent apoptosis. We have previously shown that FDH induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser6, which is a required step in the activation of apoptosis. In the present study, we report that FDH-induced p53 phosphorylation is carried out by JNK1 and JNK2 (c-Jun N-terminal kinases) working in concert. We have demonstrated that FDH induces phosphorylation of JNK1 and JNK2, while treatment of FDH-expressing cells with JNK inhibitor SP600125, as well as knockdown of JNK1 or JNK2 by siRNA, prevents phosphorylation of p53 at Ser6 and protects cells from apoptosis. Interestingly, the knockdown of JNK1 abolished phosphorylation of JNK2 in response to FDH, while knockdown of JNK2 did not prevent JNK1 phosphorylation. Pull-down assay with the p53-specific antibody has shown that JNK2, but not JNK1, is physically associated with p53. Our studies revealed a novel mechanism in which phosphorylation of JNK2 is mediated by JNK1 before phosphorylation of p53, and then p53 is directly phosphorylated by JNK2 at Ser6."
https://openalex.org/W2035539272,"High-precision 60Fe-60Ni isotope data show that most meteorites originating from differentiated planetesimals that accreted within 1 million years of the solar system's formation have 60Ni/58Ni ratios that are approximately 25 parts per million lower than samples from Earth, Mars, and chondrite parent bodies. This difference indicates that the oldest solar system planetesimals formed in the absence of 60Fe. Evidence for live 60Fe in younger objects suggests that 60Fe was injected into the protoplanetary disk approximately 1 million years after solar system formation, when 26Al was already homogeneously distributed. Decoupling the first appearance of 26Al and 60Fe constrains the environment where the Sun's formation could have taken place, indicating that it occurred in a dense stellar cluster in association with numerous massive stars."
https://openalex.org/W2018964420,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by stromal fibroblasts plays an important role in tumor angiogenesis. However, VEGF is also expressed by normal tissue fibroblasts, raising the question of how the VEGF activity of fibroblasts is regulated. Here we report that the latent VEGF angiogenic activity of fibroblasts is activated by cancer cells, resulting in tumor-selective utilization of fibroblast-derived VEGF. Through the production of VEGF, human VA-13 fibroblasts promote angiogenesis in and growth of human pancreas cancer Capan-1 xenograft tumors, whereas VA-13 fibroblasts alone do not show significant angiogenesis. Treatment of VA-13 fibroblast supernatant with matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), an extracellular proteinase characteristically expressed by cancer cells, elicits endothelial tube formation. This effect is abrogated by anti-VEGF antibody or connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which was previously reported to sequester VEGF and be degraded by MMP-7. Suppression of MMP-7 in Capan-1 cells abrogates the tumor angiogenic activity of VA-13 fibroblasts, which is restored by suppression of CTGF in VA-13 fibroblasts. We further show that these molecular mechanisms that trigger angiogenesis are effective in human primary fibroblasts and human colorectal tissue. These data suggest that fibroblasts may store VEGF in a latent state in the extracellular environment for urgent use in angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2047052174,"Polycystin-1 (PC1), the PKD1 gene product, plays a critical role in renal tubule diameter control and disruption of its function causes cyst formation in human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Recent evidence shows that PC1 undergoes cleavage at the juxtamembrane G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS), a process likely to be essential for its biological activity. Here we further characterized the proteolytic cleavage of PC1 at the GPS domain. We determined the actual cleavage site to be between leucine and threonine of the tripeptide HLT3049 of human PC1. Cleavage occurs in the early intracellular secretory pathway and requires initial N-glycan attachment but not its subsequent trimming. We provide evidence that the cleavage occurs via a cis-autoproteolytic mechanism involving an ester intermediate as shown for Ntn hydrolases and EMR2.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). ADPKD is characterized by the progressive development of numerous fluid-filled cysts derived from tubular epithelial cells in both kidneys, which leads to end-stage kidney disease in ∼50% of affected individuals by the age of 60. ADPKD is a systemic disease with many extrarenal manifestations, including cyst formation in the liver and spleen and cardiovascular abnormalities (1Gabow P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). PC1 is thought to function as a cell surface signaling receptor at cell-cell/cell-matrix junctions and as a mechano-sensor in renal primary cilia that activates signaling pathways involved in renal tubular differentiation (2Boletta A.

It is a 4302-amino acid (aa) 11-transmembrane glycoprotein with a large N-terminal extracellular region (ectodomain) of 3072 aa and a short cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of ∼200 aa (5Hughes J.

The ectodomain contains a novel combination of motifs. One of them is the ∼1000-aa long receptor for egg jelly (REJ) domain, a structure of unknown function, which was originally described in sea urchin receptor for egg jelly protein (6Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Situated between the REJ domain and the first transmembrane domain is the GPS (G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site) domain of ∼50 aa (7Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Curr.

It was first demonstrated to be the internal cleavage site for the neuronal G protein-coupled receptor, latrophilin/CIRL, with the actual cleavage site at HL↓T (where ↓ identifies the position of cleavage) (9Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G.

It was later identified in many proteins of the LNB-TM7 family, a group of seven-transmembrane receptors related to family-B G protein-coupled receptors (10Stacey M. Lin H.H. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 284-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These proteins, like PC1, are extraordinary for having unusually large and complex N-terminal extracellular regions; they include EMR2, ETL, and Drosophila Flamingo. We have previously shown indirectly that PC1 undergoes cleavage at the GPS domain (8Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Xu H. Liu L. Ahrabi A.K. Watnick T.J. Zhou F. Germino G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16981-16986Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This reaction results in the N-terminal fragment (NTF) and C-terminal fragment (CTF), which remain tethered noncovalently. One unique aspect of PC1 cleavage is that it is incomplete when expressed in various cell types. The degree of cleavage (DOC; (defined as the fraction of CTF over the sum of CTF and uncleaved full-length (uFL)) is typically ∼50% (i.e. an equal amount of CTF and uFL). Partial cleavage has also been found for endogenous PC1 (8Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Xu H. Liu L. Ahrabi A.K. Watnick T.J. Zhou F. Germino G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16981-16986Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). PKD1-associated missense mutations in the GPS domain and the neighboring REJ domain, as well as synthetic mutations at the predicted cleavage site, were found to disrupt the cleavage. They also resulted in loss of the functional properties of PC1 to activate the JAK2-STAT pathway and induce in vitro tubulogenesis of MDCK cells (8Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Xu H. Liu L.

These findings indicate that GPS cleavage likely plays a critical role for the biological function of PC1. The GPS or GPS-like sequence is present at a similar juxtamembrane position of all PC1 family members (11Li A. Tian X. Sung S.W. Somlo S.

Cleavage has also been demonstrated for suREJ3 (13Mengerink K.J. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 943-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and PKDREJ and suREJ2 have recently been shown to be uncleaved (14Butscheid Y. Chubanov V. Steger K.

Growth Differ. 2004; 46: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The functional significance of cleavage or noncleavage for the PC1 family is currently unclear. Proteolytic cleavage at the extracellular juxtamembrane position occurs in many membrane proteins including receptors and channel proteins (16Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem.

Van De Ven W.J. Creemers J.W. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) or at the plasma membrane (e.g. TACE sheddase) (21Malemud C.J. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 1696-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). However, several types of self-catalyzed protein modifications that do not require the intervention of other enzymes have been identified (22Perler F.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The best characterized mechanism among them is the cis-autoproteolysis, a self-catalyzed protein rearrangement that results in cleavage at the HX↓(T/S/C) (22Perler F.B. Nat. Struct.

This process is essential for the biological function of a diverse group of proteins that include Hedgehog, glycosylasparaginase, nucleoporin, and intein-containing proteins (24Paulus H. Annu. Rev.

It is initiated by a nucleophilic attack of the side chain hydroxyl group (T, S) or thiol group (C) of HX↓(T/S/C) on the penultimate α-carbonyl group. The process is followed by the reversible N–O or N–S acyl rearrangement that converts the peptide (amide) bond to a more reactive (thio)ester intermediate. The subsequent attack of the intermediate by a second nucleophile results in the irreversible cleavage of the scissile bond. Lin et al. (25Lin H.H. Chang G.W. Davies J.Q. Stacey M. Harris J.

This result suggested that PC1 might be cleaved through the same mechanism. In this study, we confirmed the cleavage site within the GPS domain of PC1 as proposed previously and identified the intracellular location at which PC1 cleavage takes place. We have provided evidence that PC1 is cleaved at the GPS domain through a similar cis-autoproteolytic mechanism involving an ester intermediate. Cell Culture—The HEK293 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MDCK(hPKD1FLAG) with stable expression of hPKD1FLAG, human PKD1 cDNA with C-terminal FLAG epitope (8Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Xu H. Liu L. Ahrabi A.K. Watnick T.J. Zhou F. Germino G.G. Proc.

All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Transfection of the cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The HEK293 stable cell lines, HEK(hPKD1FLAG) and HEK(ED-Fc), were established using the Flp-In™ T-REx™ system (Invitrogen). Reagents and Antibodies—All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Complete protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science. Agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody was from Sigma. Anti-Fc was from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Anti-CT, the polyclonal antibody against human PC1 cytoplasmic C-terminal tail is described elsewhere (27Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Protein G-agarose beads were from GE Healthcare. Generation of PC1 and ETL Cleavage Mutant Constructs—The construct wild-type (WT) hPKD1FLAG was the base plasmid for the generation of the cleavage mutants (8Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Xu H. Liu L. Ahrabi A.K. Watnick T.J. Zhou F. Germino G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16981-16986Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The cleavage mutants were generated in a two-step procedure by PCR using pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), as described in (8Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Xu H. Liu L. Ahrabi A.K. Watnick T.J. Zhou F. Germino G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16981-16986Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To generate expression vector for the soluble human PC1 or ETL ectodomain-human immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins, the Fc region of human IgG1 was PCR-amplified from a human immunoglobulin G1 Fc fragment cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF150959) and inserted in-frame at the 3′-end of the ectodomain of human PC1 (residues 1–3072) or of ETL, respectively, at AvrII site using primers Fc-F(AvrII) and Fc-R(AvrII). The sequences of the primers used are as follows (AvrII site is underlined): Fc-F(AvrII), 5′-AAAACCTAGGCAAATCTTGTGACAAAACTCA-3′; Fc-R(AvrII), 5′-TTTTCCTAGGTCATTTACCCGGAGACAGGG-3′. The AvrII site used for cloning was introduced by site-specific mutagenesis. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. EMR2 constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Hsi-Hsien Lin (Oxford, UK). Purification of PC1 ED-Fc and N-terminal Sequencing—HEK cells with stable expression of ED-Fc, HEK(ED-Fc) were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing Complete protease inhibitor cocktails for 1 h on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 9000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation using protein G-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C under constant and gentle rotation. The beads were washed three times with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and eluted with 4 ml of 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5). The eluate was neutralized by adding 800 μl of 0.5 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and concentrated using Centriprep-10 concentrators. The concentrated sample was loaded onto 10% SDS gel for electrophoresis and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the protein band was excised for N-terminal sequencing. N-terminal sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation using a protein sequencer from Applied Biosystems (Midwest Analytical, Inc). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Transfected HEK293 or MDCK cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture for 1 h on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 9000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation using agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody at 4 °C for 1 h under constant rotation. In the case of the Fc fusion proteins, protein G-agarose beads were used to bind the Fc fragment. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in SDS loading buffer by incubation at 95 °C for 3 min. The eluted immunoprecipitation product was resolved on a 4% or 3–8% SDS gel and electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with primary antibodies and then with the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (GE Healthcare). The signal was detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). In Vitro Cleavage Assay—HEK cells transfected with expression constructs of full-length WT or mutant PC1 were harvested for lysis as described as above. The PC1 proteins were bound to agarose-counjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody. For in vitro cleavage reaction, the beads were evenly distributed to the tubes for different time points. For example, the beads were evenly distributed to nine tubes for four time points. Tube 1 was a negative control at time zero. 250 mm hydroxylamine was added to four of the remaining eight tubes, and the other four tubes were used as parallel negative controls. The time zero negative control was eluted from the beads by SDS loading buffer right after the distribution of the beads. Other samples remained at 4 °C until they were taken out at desired time points. After washing twice with cleavage buffer, the samples were eluted with SDS loading buffer and kept at –80 °C before loading onto 3–8% SDS-PAGE for Western blotting. For the soluble Fc fusion proteins isolated from the conditioned media, the in vitro cleavage reaction was carried out as described by Lin et al. (25Lin H.H. Chang G.W. Davies J.Q. Stacey M. Harris J. Gordon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31823-31832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fusion proteins bound to the protein G-agarose beads were evenly distributed to three tubes (tubes 1, 2, and 3). The protein in tube 1 was eluted immediately in the SDS loading buffer and served as control. The cleavage buffer was added to tubes 2 and 3. To tube 3, 250 mm hydroxylamine was also added. Tubes 2 and 3 were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. The proteins were then eluted in the SDS loading buffer for detection. The signal intensity of the blots was quantified by scanning densitometry using NIH ImageJ software. DOC is the fraction of CTF over the sum of CTF and uncleaved full-length PC1. Determination of the Cleavage Site within the GPS Domain of PC1—The exact site of cleavage within the GPS domain of human PC1 was proposed to be at HL↓T3049 (7Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R585-R588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Xu H. Liu L. Ahrabi A.K. Watnick T.J. Zhou F. Germino G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16981-16986Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We sought to confirm the cleavage site by N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the ∼150-kDa CTF fragment from HEK(hPKD1FLAG), which stably expresses human FLAG-tagged PC1 at the C terminus, but were unable to obtain sufficient quantity of the product. We therefore resorted to using ED-Fc, the human PC1 ectodomain (aa 1–3072) fused to human IgG Fc fragment (28Qian F. Wei W. Germino G. Oberhauser A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40723-40730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). ED-Fc was cleaved when expressed in cells, as evident by detection of a ∼34-kDa Stalk-Fc band by anti-Fc (Fig. 1C). The T/R(+1)-Fc, which contains the T to R mutation at the critical +1 position of HL↓T, known to disrupt cleavage of full-length PC1 (8Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Xu H. Liu L. Ahrabi A.K. Watnick T.J. Zhou F. Germino G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16981-16986Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), was not cleaved. This result confirmed that ED-Fc was cleaved at the same site as the full-length PC1. We isolated the ∼34-kDa Stalk-Fc for N-terminal sequencing following SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D) and determined the sequence of five N-terminal residues as TAFGA (Fig. 1E). We therefore concluded that the cleavage site of PC1 is indeed at the predicted HL↓T3049, a site 23 aa N-terminal to the first transmembrane domain. Subcellular Localization of PC1 Cleavage—We sought to define the intracellular location where PC1 cleavage occurs by using inhibitors affecting protein trafficking (Fig. 2A). Brefeldin A (BFA) blocks membrane protein export out of ER by dissembling the Golgi complex and fusion of Golgi cisternae with ER, whereas monensin blocks intra-Golgi protein trafficking (29Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells, PC1 cleavage was considerably reduced by BFA, as evident by reduced DOC (∼15%) (Fig. 2B, lane 2), compared with the untreated control (∼50%) (lane 1). However, it was not affected by monensin (lane 3). This result indicated that a modest amount of PC1 was cleaved in ER and a considerable amount was cleaved post-ER, probably in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (30Appenzeller-Herzog C. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This result differs from that of EMR2, which is cleaved exclusively in ER (25Lin H.H. Chang G.W. Davies J.Q. Stacey M. Harris J. Gordon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31823-31832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To assay whether the location of PC1 cleavage may differ between cell types, we performed the same analyses in MDCK cells with stable PC1 expression. We found that both BFA (up to 500 μg/ml) and monensin only minimally affected PC1 cleavage (lanes 9, 11 and 12), indicating that cleavage occurred predominantly in the ER in MDCK cells. Our results indicate that PC1 cleavage takes place in the early secretory pathway but the location may differ between cell types. Role of N-Glycosylation of PC1 for Cleavage—PC1 is heavily N-glycosylated (31Boletta A. Qian F. Onuchic L.F. Bragonzi A. Cortese M. Deen P.M. Courtoy P.J. Soria M.R. Devuyst O. Monaco L. Germino G.G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20763-20773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We examined the role of N-glycosylation for PC1 cleavage. We found that inhibition of N-glycosylation of PC1 by tunicamycin (TM), as evident by increased mobility of the full-length PC1, abolished cleavage in both HEK293 and MDCK cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 10), indicating that the N-glycan addition to PC1 is required for cleavage, likely for correct folding of the protein. We examined whether the subsequent processing of the N-glycan plays a role for its cleavage using glycosidase inhibitors in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). Hepatocystin is the regulatory subunit of glucosidase II that carries out the initial glucose trimming and thus the ER quality control of newly synthesized glycoproteins in concert with lectin chaperones (33Drenth J.P.

We found that castanospermine (CAS) and 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), the inhibitors of both glucosidase I and II (38Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), did not affect PC1 cleavage (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that glucose trimming and thus hepatocystin are not required for PC1 cleavage. In agreement with this result, inhibitors of mannosidases of the Golgi, 1-deoxymannojirimycin (ManDNJ) and swainsonine (SW), did not affect PC1 cleavage (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8). Our results show that PC1 cleavage occurs after the transfer of the oligosaccharide precursor but does not require its subsequent processing. Evidence for cis-Autoproteolytic Mechanism for PC1 Cleavage—The sequence of the GPS domain in PC1 does not match the consensus cleavage site of any known intracellular processing proteases. We noticed that the cleavage tripeptide HL↓T of PC1 matches the cleavage site sequence HX↓(T/S/C) of the cis-autoproteolytic proteins, although no overall sequence similarity outside of it could be recognized between them (Fig. 3A). To determine whether PC1 cleavage might occur through a similar cis-autoproteolytic mechanism, we first examined the requirement of the +1 position residue for cleavage (Fig. 3, B and C). Such a mechanism requires that only Thr, Ser, and Cys, which contain a nucleophile side chain (-OH or -SH group), can support cleavage. We found that this was indeed the case. Substitution of Thr by Ser or Cys did not disrupt the cleavage, although the latter reduced the DOC (3–5%). Cleavage also occurred when the whole HL↓T was replaced by the cleavage tripeptide HF↓S of nucleoporin (39Rosenblum J.S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11370-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, substitution of Thr to Val, Gly, or Arg blocked cleavage (Fig. 3C). We next examined the formation of the postulated peptide ester, the hallmark of the cis-autoproteolysis, in the FLAG-purified WT PC1 expressed in HEK293 cells. The sample represents the steady-state condition of the cells and contains ∼50% of uFL available for the study. Formation of an ester intermediate in the known cis-autoproteolytic proteins is usually inferred from the increased cleavage rate in vitro by strong nitrogen nucleophiles such as hydroxylamine (23Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 25Lin H.H. Chang G.W. Davies J.Q. Stacey M. Harris J. Gordon S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9695-9702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This effect is a result of the facilitated hydrolysis of the (thio)ester intermediate (the rate-limiting step in the cis-autoproteolysis) by virtue of the high reactivity of hydroxylamine against peptide (thio)ester. We found no cleavage of the uFL PC1 occurring in vitro at various temperatures (4, 25, or 37 °C) regardless of the presence or absence of hydroxylamine as judged by the unchanged DOC (∼50%) (Fig. 3D, shown for reactions at 4 °C). While our kinetic study was under way, Lin et al. (25Lin H.H. Chang G.W. Davies J.Q. Stacey M. Harris J. Gordon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31823-31832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) reported that EMR2 is cleaved at its GPS domain via the cis-autoproteolytic mechanism. We reexamined PC1 cleavage using the condition as described in that study but still found no cleavage (not shown). Our result suggests that no detectable amount of stable ester intermediate was present in the sample during the incubation. Alternatively, the postulated oxygen ester intermediate might not be susceptible to hydroxylamine under our neutral conditions. We therefore performed the same analysis with FLAG-purified T/C(+1) mutant, in which the presumed thioester intermediate is known to be much more reactive to hydroxylamine than the oxygen ester in WT, as found for protein splicing reaction (41Shao Y. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3810-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We found that T/C(+1) uFL underwent slow cleavage at 4 °C (to minimize activity of potential contaminating proteases) in the absence of hydroxylamine, with no cleavage apparent in the first 5 h of incubation (DOC ∼3%; Fig. 3E). However, cleavage consistently proceeded to a DOC of ∼11% after 16 h of incubation, a ∼4-fold of progression. In the presence of hydroxylamine, this DOC was reached after only 1 h of incubation and remained unchanged over time. Higher temperatures (25 or 37 °C) did not result in a higher DOC (not shown). Therefore, hydroxylamine shortened the t½ (defined as the time to reach half of the maximal DOC) from >5 h to <15 min, which is a >20-fold increase of the cleavage rate (Fig. 3F). In the presence of iodoacetamide, a thiol-alkylation reagent, this T/C(+1)"

However, the molecular mechanisms mediating essential pathophysiological functions remain poorly defined. Here, we used comparative expression profiling of PAX3/FKHR silencing in vitro and PAX3/FKHR-specific gene signatures in vivo to identify physiologically important target genes. Hereby, 51 activated genes, both novel and known, were identified. We also found repression of skeletal muscle-specific genes suggesting that PAX3/FKHR blocks further differentiation of aRMS cells. Importantly, TFAP2B was validated as direct target gene mediating the anti-apoptotic function of PAX3/FKHR. Hence, we developed a pathophysiologically relevant transcriptional profile of PAX3/FKHR and identified a critical target gene for aRMS development."

The ectodomain is anchored to the viral envelope by a C-terminally located transmembrane domain (TMD), which precedes an ∼150-residue cytoplasmic domain. The majority of the gp41 ectodomain appears to be buried by the gp120 trimer. This model for gp41 in the context of prefusion Env is based on the findings that the epitopes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) encompassing the fusion peptide and polar segment (residues 521–538), disulfide bonded region (579–613), and C-helix (644–663), are largely occluded in prefusion Env but become exposed following interaction between gp120 and recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) or receptor expressing cells (17Finnegan C.M.

By contrast, the epitopes of mAbs 2F5 and 4E10 within the MPR (662–667) are exposed in gp120-gp41 prior to CD4 binding indicating an external location for this region (17Finnegan C.M. Berg W.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1398-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These data are largely reflected in a structural model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Env derived by cryoelectron tomography (22Zhu P. Liu J. Bess Jr., J. Chertova E. Lifson J.D. Grise H. Ofek G.A. Taylor K.A. Roux K.H. Nature. 2006; 441: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In this model, a large globular domain comprises a gp120 trimer surrounding the gp41 ectodomain and is anchored to the plasma membrane by a splayed tripod, which corresponds to the MPR in an extensive interaction with the viral envelope. However, an alternative cryoelectron tomographic model of SIV gp120-gp41 revealed a more compact head domain linked to the membrane via a stalk with no evidence of a tripod-like structure (23Zanetti G. Briggs J.A. Grunewald K. Sattentau Q.J. Fuller S.D. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e83Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The structure of the MPR in situ therefore remains an open question. gp120-receptor interactions trigger the membrane fusion cascade, beginning with insertion of the fusion peptide into the outer leaflet of the target membrane and gp41 adopting a pre-hairpin intermediate conformation that bridges the viral and cellular membranes (24Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Trivedi V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5299-5309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Gordon L.M. Mobley P.W. Pilpa R. Sherman M.A. Waring A.J. Biochim.

In the prehairpin intermediate, the trimeric coiled coil of N-helices is exposed and available for interaction with peptides derived from the C-helix that can prevent subsequent stages of the fusion cascade. Likewise, exposed C-helices are available for interaction with synthetic analogues of the N-helix, which also inhibit fusion (18Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct.

These interactions mimic the antiparallel packing of native C-helices into hydrophobic grooves on the exterior of the coiled-coil that forms the 6-helix bundle (6HB) core, bringing together the N- and C-terminal membrane inserted ends of gp41 (the fusion peptide and TMD), and the associated viral and cellular membranes for merger (30Caffrey M.

Three phases of cell-cell and virus-cell membrane fusion have been discerned experimentally for class I fusion proteins: lipid mixing or hemifusion; the opening of a small pore through which small solutes can pass; and pore expansion (35Blumenthal R.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). These events precede entry of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytosol. Six-helix bundle formation and hemifusion appear to be co-dependent processes as lipids that promote positive spontaneous membrane curvature and block hemifusion also prevent completion of the trimer of hairpins fold (37Melikyan G.B. Markosyan R.M. Hemmati H. Delmedico M.K. Lambert D.M. Cohen F.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). How conserved sequences located outside the 6HB core domain of gp41, such as the N-terminally located polar segment adjacent to the fusion peptide, and the C-terminal Trp-rich MPR linking the C-helix to the TMD (40Salzwedel K. West J.T. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2469-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contribute to the membrane fusion mechanism is not clearly understood. The MPR is of particular interest as it is a highly conserved region that overlaps with the C terminus of the Fuzeon inhibitor peptide and encompasses the epitopes of the two most broadly neutralizing mAbs available, 2F5 and 4E10 (41Binley J.M.

The MPR is functionally relevant as simultaneous Ala replacements of the conserved Trp666-Trp670-Trp672-Trp678-Trp680 cluster block fusion pore opening (44Munoz-Barroso I. Salzwedel K. Hunter E. Blumenthal R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6089-6092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an effect that may be related to the lipid destabilizing properties of this sequence (45Saez-Cirion A. Nir S. Lorizate M.

For example, the 2F5 epitope (Glu657-Trp670) is available for mAb binding in prefusion and prehairpin intermediate forms of Env but becomes occluded when the 6HB forms (21Dimitrov A.S. Jacobs A.

This change in antigenicity corresponds to a structural transition for the N-terminal portion (Glu657-Asp664) from an extended conformation to α-helix (30Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J.

Virol. 2004; 78: 10724-10737Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Helical conformation has also been observed for the MPR when bound to lipid (52Schibli D.J. Montelaro R.C. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Antibody binding studies suggest that the polar segment and MPR occupy internal and external locations, respectively, in prefusion gp120-gp41 complexes (17Finnegan C.M. Berg W. Lewis G.K. DeVico A.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12123-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Sattentau Q.J. Zolla-Pazner S. Poignard P.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1398-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By contrast, these sequences would become apposed at the membrane-interactive end of the fusion-activated trimer of hairpins by formation of the 6HB. Consistent with this idea, extension of the 6HB core to include residues 528–535 of the polar segment and residues 669–677 of the MPR confers stability to a trimer of hairpins model protein (53Lay C.S. Wilson K.A. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Drummer H.E. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this study we assessed the functional role of the polar segment and MPR. Alanine replacement of conserved residues within the MPR did not affect cell-cell fusion but resulted in 8–120-fold reductions in viral entry. Simultaneous Ala replacement of MPR residues with Leu537 of the polar segment inhibited cell-cell fusion, viral entry, and sCD4-induced dissociation of gp120 from the Env complex. By using a trimer of hairpins model of gp41, we found that simultaneous mutations in the polar segment and MPR destabilized the membrane interactive end of this fusion-activated structure. We propose that the MPR has distinct roles in different stages of the fusion cascade. HIV-1 Env Expression Vectors—Preparation of the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven HIV-1AD8 Env expression vector, pCDNA3.1-AD8env, is described elsewhere (54Poumbourios P. Maerz A.L. Drummer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42149-42160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In vitro mutagenesis of the gp41 region was carried out by overlap extension PCR techniques. Bacteriophage T7 promoter-driven Env expression vectors based on pTM.1 (55Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) were generated by transferring the HIV-1AD8 env fragment bounded by NdeI and XhoI, from pCDNA3.1-AD8env to pTMenv.2, giving pTM-AD8env (56Poumbourios P. Ahmar W.E. McPhee D.A. Kemp B.E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequences were confirmed using the ABI BigDye terminator reagent. Env was either expressed in a Rev-dependent manner from the cytomegalovirus promoter of pCDNA3.1-AD8env, or in a Rev-independent manner from the bacteriophage T7 promoter in pTM-AD8env (55Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 56Poumbourios P. Ahmar W.E. McPhee D.A. Kemp B.E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Rev-independent expression, the cells were cotransfected with pTM-AD8env and pCAG-T7, the latter directing expression of bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase from a cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer and chicken β-actin promoter (57Takikawa S. Ishii K. Aizaki H. Suzuki T. Asakura H. Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5066-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the pTM-AD8env-transfected cells were infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7.3, which directs expression of bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (55Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Cells—293T, BHK21, HeLa, and U373MG-CCR5 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modification of minimal essential medium, 10% fetal calf serum (complete medium) and transfected with expression vectors using FuGENE 6 (Roche). U87.CD4.CCR5 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified minimal essential medium, 15% fetal calf serum supplemented with puromycin (0.1 mg/ml) and G418 (0.3 mg/ml).

Processing of Env Glycoproteins—At 24-h post-transfection, 293T cells were lysed for 10 min on ice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C prior to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with mAb C8. The immunoblots were developed with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit IgG to mouse Ig and enhanced chemiluminescence or with Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Invitrogen) and scanning in a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imager. Biosynthetic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—293T cells were cotransfected with pTM-AD8env and pCAG-T7 plasmids. At 48-h post-transfection, the cells were incubated for 30 min in cysteine and methionine-deficient medium (MP Biomedicals, Seven Hills, New South Wales, Australia), and then labeled for either 20 or 45 min with 150 μCi of Tran35S-label (MP Biomedicals). The cells were then washed and chased in complete medium for 6 h prior to lysis. All incubations were performed at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cell lysates and clarified culture supernatants were immunoprecipitated with various antibodies and protein G-Sepharose and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, as described previously (54Poumbourios P.

The labeled proteins were visualized by scanning in a Fuji phosphorimager. Luciferase Reporter Assay of Cell to Cell Fusion—293T effector cells (250,000 cells per well of a 12-well culture plate) were cotransfected with pCDNA3.1-AD8env or pTM-AD8env and pCAG-T7 plasmids. BHK21 target cells (250,000 cells per well of a 12-well culture plate) were cotransfected with pT4luc (62Maerz A.L. Drummer H.E. Wilson K.A. Poumbourios P. J.

At 24 h post-transfection, targets and effectors were each resuspended in 1 ml of complete medium; targets (100 μl) were co-cultured with effectors (100 μl) in a 96-well plate for a further 18 h at 37 °C. The cells were assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega SteadyGlo reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Lipid Mixing Assays—Lipid mixing assays were performed as described previously (64Baaör S. Alizon M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HeLa effector cells (200,000 cells per well of a 6-well plate) were transfected with wild type or mutant Env-expression vectors. At 5 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with vTF7.3. At 18 h post-transfection, Env expressing cells were labeled with 2 μm DiO (3,3′-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate; green fluorescence, excitation at 484 nm, emission at 501 nm (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)), whereas target U373MG-CCR5 cells were labeled with 2 μm DiI (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; red fluorescence, excitation at 549 nm, emission at 565 nm) for 2 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, target cells were detached with PBS, 1 mm EDTA and added to an equivalent number of adherent effector cells. Following 2 h of co-culture at 37 °C, the cells were detached with trypsin, and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Two-color fluorescence analysis was performed on an Epics XL flow cytometer. Cells displaying >4 and >70 arbitrary log units in the green and red wavelengths, respectively, were scored as double-fluorescent cells. Single Cycle Infectivity Assays—Env-pseudotyped luciferase reporter viruses were produced by cotransfecting 293T cells (350,000 cells per well of a 6-well Linbro culture plate) with either 1 μg of pCDNA3.1-AD8env plus 1 μg of luciferase reporter virus vector, pNL4.3.Luc.R–E– (obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program from N.

Drummer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42149-42160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The protein composition of pseudotyped virions was assessed by first pelleting the virions from 9 ml of transfection supernatant through a 1.5-ml 25% (w/v) sucrose/PBS cushion (Beckman SW41 Ti rotor, 25,000 rpm, 2.5 h, 4 °C) followed by reducing SDS-PAGE in 7.5–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels and Western blotting with IgG 14 and goat anti-Env 2–3. The immunoblots were developed with IRDye 800CW-conjugated rabbit anti-human Ig (Rockland) or Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated donkey anti-goat Ig (Invitrogen), respectively, and scanning in a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imager. Soluble CD4-induced Shedding of gp120—293T cells were transfected with Env expression plasmids as described above. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were starved with methionine and cysteine-free medium for 30 min and then pulse labeled with 150 μCi of Tran35S-label for 45 min.

Although methylation of histone H3 at lysines 4 and 36 is linked to transcription, the roles of histone demethylases in transcription regulation are not understood. Here we show that overexpression of either Jhd1 or Rph1, two JmjC-domain proteins, bypasses the requirement for the positive elongation factor gene BUR1. Biochemical analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that Rph1 functions as a specific demethylase for H3 K36me3 and K36me2, directly regulating Lys36 methylation in transcribed regions. Both Jhd1 and Rph1 are required for normal levels of RNA polymerase II cross-linking to genes. Taken together, these findings indicate that a general function of histone demethylases for H3 Lys36 is to promote transcription elongation by antagonizing repressive Lys36 methylation by Set2.

Five lysine residues (Lys4, Lys9, Lys27, Lys36, and Lys79) of histone H3 and Lys20 of histone H4 are methylated by specific histone methyltransferases (5Zhang Y. Reinberg D.

Furthermore, methylation states (mono-, di-, and tri-) within the same residue can produce different biological and transcriptional consequences.

In contrast, transcriptionally inactive regions are methylated at H3 Lys9 and Lys27 as well as H4 Lys20. In yeast, H3 Lys4, Lys36, and Lys79 are methylated by Set1, Set2, and Dot1 methyltransferases, respectively (13Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol.

Although histone methylation was originally thought to be a stable mark, recent studies show that methylation can be reversed by histone demethylases. Mammalian lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) specifically reverses mono- and dimethylation of H3 Lys4 and functions as a transcriptional repressor (23Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P.

Recently, a family of histone demethylases characterized by the presence of a JmjC domain was identified. Unlike LSD1, JmjC demethylases are found from bacteria to humans and can theoretically reverse all three lysine methylation states by a Fe(II)- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent mechanism (25Tsukada Y.

Mammalian JHDM1 and JHDM2A have been shown to antagonize mono- and dimethylation of H3 Lys36 and H3 Lys9, respectively, and the JMJD2/JHDM3 family preferentially reverses di- and trimethylation of both H3 Lys36 and Lys9 (25Tsukada Y.

In contrast, JMJM2A/JHDM3A, a trimethyl-specific demethylase for Lys9 and Lys36, negatively regulates ASCL2 transcription (28Klose R.J. Yamane K. Bae Y. Zhang D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

The Set2/Rpd3C(S) pathway also inhibits elongation by RNA Pol II, and this inhibition is counteracted by the positive elongation factor Bur1 (31Keogh M.C. Kurdistani S.K. Morris S.A. Ahn S.H.

Biol. 2006; 26: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To further understand connections between H3 Lys36 methylation and transcription, we isolated high copy suppressors of bur1Δ. We reasoned that such suppressors may have a positive role in transcription and/or antagonize the Set2-Rpd3C(S) pathway. Two isolated suppressors were JHD1 and RPH1, both of which have a JmjC domain motif for histone demethylases. Jhd1 has previously been shown to specifically demethylate H3 Lys36 (25Tsukada Y. Fang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Warren M.E. Borchers C.H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Nature. 2006; 439: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Here we show that Rph1 can reverse both tri- and dimethylation at Lys36. We present evidence that the Jhd1 and Rph1 Lys36 demethylases promote transcription by RNA Pol II through repressive chromatin generated by Set2 and Rpd3C(S). Antibodies—The following histone antibodies were used: anti-H3K36Me1 (Abcam 9048), anti-H3K36Me3 (Abcam 9050), anti-H3 (Abcam 1791), and anti-H3K36Me2 (Upstate Biotechnology 07-369). Anti-Rpb3 was from Neoclone. Protein A- and protein G-Sepharose-4 Fastflow were from Amersham Biosciences, and IgG-agarose was from Sigma. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1 and plasmids in supplemental Table S2. To generate pRS424 plasmids containing JHD1, RPH1, YJR119c/JHD2, GIS1, or ECM5, the entire ORF and 1kb of upstream region was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers that create terminal NotI/SmaI (for RPH1, YJR119c/JHD2, and ECM5) or NotI/BamHI (for JHD1 and GIS1) sites. To construct pRS424-JHD1-3XHA, the JHD1 fragment digested with NotI and BamHI was cloned with a 500-bp BamHI/XhoI fragment containing 3× HA and SSN6 terminator from pBSSK(+)-3XHA/SSN6 terminator into the NotI/XhoI sites of pRS424. For cloning of RPH1, YJR119c/JHD2, ECM5 and GIS1, PCR fragments were gel-purified, digested with the appropriate enzymes for the new terminal sites, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pRS424-JHD1-3XHA. The downstream primers removed the stop codon and produced an in frame fusion to express triple-HA epitope tagged proteins. JHD1 and RPH1 point mutants were constructed by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. The sequences of oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S3. Phenotype Analyses—To isolate high copy suppressors of bur1Δ, the BUR1 shuffle strain YSB787 was transformed with pRS424 plasmids (2 micron, TRP1) containing different genes, and the resulting transformants were patched on synthetic complete media lacking uracil (as a positive growth control) or SC media containing 5-FOA (to select against the BUR1/URA3 plasmid). The plates were incubated for 2–6 days as indicated. Spotting analyses were performed as previously described (35Keogh M.C. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell.

Whole cell extracts were made from wild type or set2Δ cells and nucleosomes were isolated via an Hhf2-TAP fusion protein by precipitation with IgG-agarose. A non-tagged strain served as a negative control. The bead-bound nucleosomes were incubated with whole cell extracts from cells containing either Jhd1-HA or Rph1-HA tagged proteins. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the complexes were washed four times with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A) and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting analysis with the indicated antibodies. Chromatin Immunoprecipitations—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were carried out as previously described with minor modifications (35Keogh M.C. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell.

For histone H3 and H3K36Me IPs, 1 μl of anti-H3 or 0.5 μl of anti-H3 K36Me3 were bound to protein A-agarose beads and used to precipitate chromatin. For K36Me3 antibody, binding was done overnight in FA lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% deoxycholate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 m NaCl. The precipitates were washed with the same buffer, once with FA lysis buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl, once with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25 m LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and once with TE (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA). Elution and decross-linking was performed as previously described (35Keogh M.C. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7005-7018Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 38Ahn S.H.

The sequences of oligonucleotides for PCR amplification are in supplemental Table S3. In Vitro Demethylase Assay—Recombinant Rph1 proteins were expressed as hexahistidine fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and purified using nickel-agarose. 4–6 μg of purified wild-type or mutated Rph1 proteins were incubated with 10 μgof calf thymus type II-A histones (Sigma) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 μm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 1 mm α-ketoglutarate, and 2 mm ascorbate) for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. The reaction mixtures were subject to SDS-PAGE (15%) followed by Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Overexpression of JmjC-domain Proteins Jhd1 or Rph1 Suppresses bur1Δ—Yeast cells grow poorly or not at all if they lack the Bur1/Bur2 kinase complex, but this requirement can be bypassed by mutation of H3 Lys36 to alanine, deletion of the SET2 methyltransferase gene, or by deletions of genes encoding components of the Rpd3C(S) HDAC complex (31Keogh M.C.

These results indicate that Set2-dependent Lys36 methylation is a repressive mark that negatively regulates transcription. We therefore predicted that histone demethylases that can reverse Lys36 methylation should have a positive role in transcription. Furthermore, overexpression of histone demethylases for Lys36 might also suppress the growth defect of bur1Δ. To explore this possibility, we tested whether overexpression of JmjC domain containing proteins could suppress the poor growth phenotype of a bur1Δ strain. Budding yeast has five JmjC proteins: Jhd1, Rph1, Gis1, Ecm5, and Yjr119c/Jhd2 (supplemental Fig. S1). Among these, two genes were considered likely candidates for bur1Δ suppressors. Jhd1 is most similar to mammalian JHDM1A, which antagonizes Lys36 mono- and dimethylation. Jhd1 can remove methyl groups from Set2 methylated H3 Lys36 in vitro, although no in vivo activity has been assigned (25Tsukada Y. Fang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Warren M.E. Borchers C.H. Tempst P.

Kachirskaia I. Walter K.L. Kuo J.H. Lake A. Davrazou F. Chan S.M. Martin D.G. Fingerman I.M. Briggs S.D. Howe L. Utz P.J. Kutateladze T.G. Lugovskoy A.A. Bedford M.T. Gozani O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 2450-2455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Since the Eaf3 subunit of Rpd3C(S) also binds methylated Lys36, Ecm5 overexpression might also suppress bur1Δ by competing with Eaf3 for binding to nucleosomes. High copy plasmids expressing Jhd1, Rph1, Gis1, Ecm5, or Yjr119/Jhd2 were introduced into a BUR1-shuffling strain, and transformants were grown on synthetic complete (SC) media or media containing 5-FOA to test the ability to grow in the absence of BUR1. As predicted from its in vitro activity, Jhd1 overexpression allowed bur1Δ cells to grow (Fig. 1A), suggesting that Jhd1 acts as a H3 Lys36 demethylase in vivo. Surprisingly, high copy RPH1, but not GIS1, ECM5 or YJR119c/JHD2, also bypassed the requirement for BUR1 (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Rph1 was originally identified as a transcriptional repressor for the PHR1 gene (40Jang Y.K. Wang L. Sancar G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7630-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this protein has sequence similarity to mammalian JHDM3A/JMJD2A, a trimethyl-specific histone demethylase for H3 Lys9 and H3 Lys36 (27Whetstine J.R. Nottke A. Lan F. Huarte M.

Genet. 2006; 7: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that both Jhd1 and Rph1 may bypass the requirement of BUR1 by removing the repressive Lys36 methylation. To test whether the histone demethylase activities of Jhd1 and Rph1 were required to bypass the requirement for BUR1, point mutants in a key catalytic histidine (41Klose R.J. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) were constructed. The Jhd1 H305A mutation abrogates demethylase activity in vitro (25Tsukada Y. Fang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Warren M.E. Borchers C.H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Nature. 2006; 439: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar), and this allele was unable to suppress bur1Δ (Fig. 1B). Similarly, overexpression of the H235A mutant Rph1 protein also failed to bypass the requirement for BUR1 (Fig. 1B). The mutant proteins were expressed at levels comparable with wild type (Fig. 1C), arguing that the loss of suppression is due to the loss of catalytic activity rather than defects in protein folding or stability. Neither protein suppressed as strongly as deletion of SET2 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that some Lys36 methylation persists even when the demethylases are overexpressed (see below). Rph1 Reverses Trimethylation of H3 Lys36 in Vivo and in Vitro—To test whether overexpression of Jhd1 or Rph1 results in reduction of Lys36 methylation in vivo, immunoblot analysis with antibodies against different methylated forms of H3 Lys36 was carried out on chromatin fractions. Unfortunately, mono- and dimethylated Lys36 were not detectable under these conditions. However, trimethylation of H3 Lys36 was readily detected, and this signal was completely absent in set2Δ cells (Fig. 2A). Triple HA-tagged Jhd1 or Rph1 was overexpressed from the GAL10 promoter and equal amounts of chromatin fractions from the indicated strains were analyzed. Levels of Rpb3, histone H3, and dimethylated Lys4 were unaffected by overexpression of Jhd1 or Rph1. In contrast, Lys36 trimethylation levels were greatly reduced upon overexpression of Rph1 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, overexpression of Jhd1 at best caused only a small decrease in Lys36 trimethylation. To determine whether Rph1 directly acts as a Lys36 histone demethylase, recombinant Rph1 protein expressed in E. coli (shown in Fig. 2E) was tested for in vitro demethylase activity on purified bulk histones. Rph1 catalyzed demethylation of both the di- and trimethylated H3 Lys36, while mono-methylated Lys36 was unaffected (Fig. 2, C and D). This observation is consistent with previous reports that mammalian JHDM3A/JMJD2A is also capable of removing di- and trimethylation of H3 Lys36 in vitro (27Whetstine J.R. Nottke A. Lan F. Huarte M. Smolikov S. Chen Z. Spooner E. Li E. Zhang G. Colaiacovo M. Shi Y. Cell. 2006; 125: 467-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 28Klose R.J. Yamane K. Bae Y. Zhang D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y. Nature. 2006; 442: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). An Rph1 protein mutated in a key residue for Fe(II) binding (H235A) was also tested for histone demethylase activity. This mutant protein had no effect on methylated Lys36 levels (Fig. 2, C and D). Jhd1 and Rph1 Associate with Nucleosomes Independently of H3 Lys36 Methylation—In most cases it is unclear how histone demethylases are recruited to their substrates. Some may be recruited to specific genes by interacting with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Alternatively, they could be recruited directly or indirectly by other histone modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, or methylations at different residues. It was recently shown that JMJD2A/JHDM3A binds to methylated H3 Lys4 through its double Tudor domain (42Huang Y. Fang J. Bedford M.T. Zhang Y. Xu R.M. Science. 2006; 312: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Jhd1 contains a PHD finger and Rph1 has two zinc fingers (supplemental Fig. S1). The Rph1 zinc domains have been implicated in sequence-specific binding (40Jang Y.K. Wang L. Sancar G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7630-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To monitor the association of Jhd1 and Rph1 with histones, a chromatin binding assay was performed. Nucleosomes were isolated via a Hhf2-TAP protein from SET2 or set2Δ strains and incubated with whole cell extracts from cells expressing Jhd1-HA or Rph1-HA. Both Jhd1 and Rph1 co-precipitated with nucleosomes regardless of whether Lys36 methylation by Set2 was present (Fig. 3). We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation to map the positions of Jhd1 and Rph1 along transcribed and transcriptionally inactive regions. However, no enrichment of Jhd1 or Rph1 was observed with either TAP-tagged or triple HA-tagged proteins (data not shown). Therefore, the association of these two JmjC proteins with histones might be equivalent throughout the genome or else too weak or transient to detect by ChIP. Since these two demethylases might be working together, we tested whether Jhd1 and Rph1 are associated. However, precipitations of TAP-tagged Rph1 did not co-precipitate Jhd1. The converse experiment also gave negative results (data not shown). Rph1 Regulates H3 Lys36 Methylation at Actively Transcribed Regions—Set2-depend"

Thus, PKCζ may function as a physiological Bax kinase to directly phosphorylate and interact with Bax, which leads to sequestration of Bax in cytoplasm and abrogation of the proapoptotic function of Bax. Apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway is mainly controlled and mediated by Bcl2 family proteins. Bax is a major multidomain proapoptotic member of the Bcl2 family that is required for apoptotic cell death (1Wei M. Zong W. Cheng E. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A. Roth K. MacGregor G. Thompson C. Korsmeyer S. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). However, the signaling mechanism(s) by which Bax is regulated remains enigmatic. It has been proposed that activation of the proapoptotic function of Bax likely occurs through several interdependent mechanisms including translocation from cytosol to mitochondria (2Goping I.

The mechanisms for activation have been established for sequential phosphorylation, the recruiting of proper localization, and the exchanging of binding proteins (11Kim J. Kim J.H. Ohba M. Suh P. Ryu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3194-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Growing evidence indicates that PKC family members play important roles in regulating cell survival and apoptosis (12DeVries T. Kalkofen R. Matassa A. Reyland M. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 5955-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All these findings support the notion that Bcl-2 family members potentially function as downstream targets of PKCs in regulating cell survival and cell death. PKCζ is a member of the atypical PKC subfamily and plays a critical role in suppression of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (20Brady S. Allan L. Clarke P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10543-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Wang Y. Seibenhener M. Vandenplas M. Wooten M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). PKCζ consists of four functional domains and motifs, including a PB1 domain in the N terminus, a pseudosubstrate (PS) sequence, a C1 domain of a single Cysrich zinc finger motif, and a kinase domain in the C terminus (22Hirai T. Chida K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The kinase domain includes an ATP-binding region, an activation loop, a turn motif, and a hydrophobic motif. The ATP-binding domain contains a Lys residue (Lys281) that is crucial for its kinase activity. A mutation of Lys → Trp at Lys281 site resulted in a kinase-defective dominant negative form of PKCζ (i.e. K281W) (23LaVallie E. Chockalingam P. Collins-Racie L. Freeman B. Keohan C. Leitges M. Dorner A. Morris E. Majumdar M. Arai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24124-24137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The activation loop and turn motif contain two important phosphorylation sites (i.e. Thr410 and Thr560). Phosphorylation of Thr410 and Thr560 residues is essential for PKCζ activation (24Chou M. Hou W. Johson J. Graham L. Lee M. Chen C. Newton A. Schaffhausen B. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Standaert M. Bandyopadhyay G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25308-25316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). PKCζ is insensitive to second messengers such as Ca2+ and diacylglycerol. Thus, its activity is primarily regulated by protein-protein interaction and phosphorylation (11Kim J. Kim J.H. Ohba M. Suh P. Ryu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3194-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The signal mechanisms for PKCζ activation include the PDK1-dependent (i.e. PI3K/PIP3/PDK1/PKCζ) and PDK1-independent (i.e. PI3K/PIP3/PKCζ) pathways (22Hirai T. Chida K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Growth factor or agonist-induced activation of PI3K produces PIP3. On the one hand, PDK1 binds to PIP3 via its PH domain, which results in activation of PDK1. The activated PDK1 interacts with PKCζ and phosphorylates the kinase domain at Thr410, which induces Thr560 phosphorylation. On the other hand, PKCζ directly interacts with PIP3, which releases PS-dependent autoinhibition. Both contributions of PIP3 and PDK1 are necessary for the complete and stable activation of PKCζ (22Hirai T. Chida K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phospholipase D2 has recently been identified as a novel protein cofactor for activation of PKCζ that can enhance PKCζ activity through direct interaction in a lipase activity-independent manner (11Kim J. Kim J.H. Ohba M. Suh P. Ryu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3194-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our previous findings reveal that nicotine stimulates Bax phosphorylation in association with increased cell survival (9Xin M. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10781-10789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, a direct signal link between PKCζ and Bax in nicotine-induced cancer cell survival has not been established, yet. Here we have demonstrated that PKCζ functions as a novel nicotine-activated Bax kinase that directly phosphorylates and inactivates Bax in human lung cancer cells. Materials—Nicotine and cisplatin were purchased from Sigma. Purified, active PKCζ, myristoylated PKCζ pseudosubstrate peptide (MYR-PKCζ-PS, Myr-SIYRRGARRWRKL-OH) and the myristoylated PKCα pseudosubstrate peptide (MYR-PKCα-PS, Myr-N-FARKGALRQ-NH2) were obtained from Calbiochem. Bax, Bcl2, prohibitin, and PKCζ antibodies, PKCζ siRNA1 (sense strand sequence: CAAGCCAAGCGCUUUAACAtt) and PKCζ siRNA2 (sense strand sequence: CAGAUGGAAUUGCUUACAUtt) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Myelin basic protein (MBP) was obtained from Invitrogen. HA-tagged wild type (WT), constitutively active A119D and dominant negative (DN) K281W PKCζ mutants in pcDNA3 were kindly provided by Dr. Brian Law (University of Florida). Recombinant purified WT, BH1, BH2, and BH3 deletion mutant proteins were purchased from Protein X (San Diego, CA). WT and Bax-/- MEF cells were kindly provided by Dr. Douglas R. Green (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis). All reagents used were obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture, cDNA Constructs, and Transfections—WT and Bax-/- MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mm l-glutamine as described (26Chipuk J. Kuwana T. Hayes L. Droin N. Newmeyer D. Schuler M. Green D. Science. 2004; 303: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). H23, H69, H82, H157, H358, H460, and H1299 were maintained in RPMI1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. A549 cells were maintained in F-12K medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mm l-glutamine. For generation of the phosphomimetic and the nonphosphorylatable Bax mutants, the 5′-phosphorylated mutagenic primers for various precise deletion mutants were synthesized as follow: S184A, 5′-GTCCTCACCGCCGCGCTCACCATCTGG-3′; S184E, 5′-GTCCTCACCGCCGAGCTCACCATCTGG-3′. The T7-tagged WT-Bax/pUC19 construct was used as the target plasmid that contains a unique NdeI restriction site for selection against the unmutated plasmid. The NdeI selection primer is: 5′-GAGTGCACCATGGGCGGTGTGAAA-3′. These Bax mutants were created using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each single mutant was confirmed by sequencing of the cDNA and then cloned into the pCIneo (Promega) mammalian expression vector. The pCIneo plasmid containing each Bax mutant cDNA was transfected into MEF Bax-/- cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). The expression levels of exogenous Bax were determined by Western blot analysis using a Bax antibody. Preparation of Total Cell Lysate—Cells were washed with 1× PBS and resuspended in ice-cold 1% CHAPS lysis buffer (1% CHAPS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was collected as the total cell lysate and used for protein analysis or co-immunoprecipitation. Assay of PKCζ Activity in Vitro—PKCζ activity was measured using MBP as substrate as previously described (27Bourbon N. Sandirasegarane L. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3286-3292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, PKCζ was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an agarose-conjugated PKCζ antibody. Immunoprecipitated PKCζ was washed and resuspended in kinase buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Tween 20, 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and MBP (10 μg). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling the sample for 5 min. The samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at -80 °C. The activity of PKCζ was determined by autoradiography. PKCζ activity was also assessed by measuring the rate of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP incorporation into a peptide (ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV) corresponding to the pseudosubstrate region of PKCɛ in which an alanine was replaced by a serine as described (28Kazanietz M.

Specific immunoprecipitation of PKCζ was performed by incubating a polyclonal PKCζ antibody overnight at 0–4 °C with 1 mg of total cell lysate protein in buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose, 1.2 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaF, Triton X-100 (1%), Nonidet (0.5%), and 150 mm NaCl. Precipitates using non-immune serum were simultaneously prepared to determine blank values. Precipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads, washed, and suspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 40 μm modified PKCɛ pseudosubstrate peptide for 10 min at 30 °C. After thermal equilibration, assays were started by the simultaneous addition of 15 μm ATP, 0.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and terminated after 30 min with 100 μl of 175 mm phosphoric acid. Then, 100 μl was transferred to P18 filter paper, and washed three times with 75 mm phosphoric acid. The level of peptide phosphorylation was determined by scintillation counting. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with phosphate-free RPMI medium and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 120 min. After agonist or inhibitor addition, cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS and lysed in detergent buffer. Bax was immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated Bax antibody. The samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at -80 °C. Bax phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. The same filter was then probed by Western blot using a Bax antibody and developed using an ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences as described previously (9Xin M. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10781-10789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells (2 × 107) were washed with cold 1× PBS and resuspended in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture set I, homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer operating for 4 bursts of 10 s each at a setting of 5, then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min to pellet the nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to pellet mitochondria as described (9Xin M. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10781-10789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The second supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g to pellet light membranes. The resulting supernatant is the cytosolic fraction. Mitochondria was washed with mitochondrial buffer twice and resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and rocked for 60 min, then centrifuged at 17,530 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant containing mitochondrial proteins was collected. Protein (100 μg) from each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bax was analyzed by Western blot using a Bax antibody. The purity of fractions was confirmed by assessing localization of fraction-specific proteins including prohibitin (mitochondria) and caspase 3 (cytosol) (30Ikonen E. Fielder K. Parton R.G. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 31Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Shabaik A. Gascoyne R. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1605-1613PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Bax in Vitro—Purified recombinant Bax protein was obtained from Protein X, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The endogenous Bax was immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated Bax antibody from lysates of A549 cells. Recombinant or endogenous Bax was resuspended in a kinase assay buffer containing 25 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 100 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with purified, active PKCζ at 30 °C for various times as indicated. The reaction was terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling prior to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of Bax was determined by autoradiography. Alkali Extraction of Bax Which Is Peripherally Associated with Mitochondrial Membranes—Cells were treated with C2-ceramide (30 μm) for 24 h. Mitochondria were isolated by subcellular fractionation and resuspended in freshly prepared 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min, and the alkali-extracted membrane pellet was collected as described (2Goping I. Gross A. Lavoie J. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S. Shore G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 10Xin M. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18859-18867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The alkali-resistant Bax (i.e. nonextractable or integral) in mitochondrial membranes was washed with kinase buffer and used as substrate for PKCζ in vitro kinase assay as described above. Immunofluorescence—A549 cells were seeded and cultured on a Lab-Tek® chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International) overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were washed with 1× PBS, fixed with ice-cold mixture of methanol/acetone (1:1), and blocked with 10% mouse and rabbit serum. Then, cells were incubated with a mouse against human Bax and a rabbit against human PKCζ primary antibodies for 90 min. After washing, samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 60 min. Cells were washed with 1× PBS and observed under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). Pictures were taken and colored with the same exposure setting for each experiment. To determine subcellular regions of protein co-localization, individual red- and green-stained images derived from the same field were merged using Openlab 3.1.5 software from Improvision, Inc. (Lexington, MA). Areas of protein co-localization appear yellow. Depletion of PKCζ Expression by RNA Interference—Human PKCζ siRNA was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A549 cells were transfected with PKCζ siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A control siRNA (non-homologous to any known gene sequence) was used as a negative control. The levels of PKCζ expression were analyzed by Western blotting using a PKCζ antibody. Bax phosphorylation or cell viability was assessed following various treatments. Specific silencing of the targeted PKCζ gene was confirmed by at least three independent experiments. Nicotine Induces Activation of PKCζ and Phosphorylation of Bax in Association with Prolonged Survival of Human Lung Cancer Cells, Which Is Suppressed by a PKCζ-specific Pseudosubstrate Inhibitor—PKCζ has been implicated in many key cellular functions including cell survival (20Brady S. Allan L. Clarke P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10543-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Plo I. Hernandez H. Kohlhagen G. Lautier D. Pommier Y. Laurent G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31407-31415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because both human small cell (SCLC) cells (i.e. H69 and H82) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (i.e. H23, H157, H358, H460, H1299, and A549) express high levels of endogenous PKCζ (Fig. 1A), nicotine may activate PKCζ to promote cell survival. To test this, A549 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of nicotine for 60 min and PKCζ was then immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated PKCζ antibody. Activity of PKCζ was measured by an immune complex kinase assay using purified MBP as a substrate as described (27Bourbon N. Sandirasegarane L. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3286-3292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The same filter was then probed by Western blot to quantify PKCζ protein. To ensure that the kinase activity that phosphorylates MBP is from PKCζ, and not from any other kinase that may be co-immunoprecipitated with PKCζ, we also probed the same filter by Western blot using a PKCι or PKCα antibody, respectively. Total cell lysate was used as a positive control. Results indicate that the PKCζ antibody specifically immunoprecipitates PKCζ and does not co-immunoprecipitates either PKCι or PKCα (Fig. 1B), indicating its specificity for PKCζ. Importantly, nicotine significantly enhances PKCζ activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). To further confirm these results, we used a modified pseudosubstrate peptide with an Ala to Ser mutation as a PKCζ substrate for the PKCζ activity assay as described (28Kazanietz M. Areces L. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J. Blumberg P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Previous reports have demonstrated that a higher level of phosphorylation by PKCζ was obtained with the peptide derived from the pseudosubstrate region of PKCɛ as compared with the peptide derived from the pseudosubstrate region of PKCζ (28Kazanietz M. Areces L. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J. Blumberg P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), indicating that the PKCɛ pseudosubstrate peptide is a better substrate for PKCζ. Therefore, we chose a modified PKCɛ pseudosubstrate peptide (ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV) as a substrate for the PKCζ activity assay as previously reported (28Kazanietz M. Areces L. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J. Blumberg P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Results indicate that treatment of A549 cells with nicotine markedly up-regulates PKCζ activity (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with the results obtained by using MBP as a substrate (Fig. 1B). We have previously demonstrated that nicotine can stimulate Bax phosphorylation in association with increased cell survival (9Xin M. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10781-10789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To assess whether PKCζ is involved in nicotine-induced Bax phosphorylation, A549 cells were exposed to nicotine in the absence or presence of the PKCζ specific inhibitor (MYR-PKCζ-PS, a myristoylated PKCζ pseudosubstrate peptide) or the myristoylated PKCα pseudosubstrate peptide (MYR-PKCα-PS) (20Brady S.

Results reveal that MYR-PKCζ-PS but not MYR-PKCα-PS potently suppresses nicotine-induced Bax phosphorylation as well as nicotine-prolonged cell survival following cisplatin treatment (Fig. 1, D and E).

The transport of molecules from the cell cytoplasm to the nucleoplasm through the nuclear pore is a key pathway through which gene expression can be controlled in some conditions. It is presently unknown if mechanical stimuli can induce changes in nuclear pore expression and/or function. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if mechanical stretching of a cell will alter nuclear protein import and the mechanisms that may be responsible. Vascular smooth muscle cells that were mechanically stretched exhibited an increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, cell number, and cell size within 24–48 h. Cells were microinjected with marker proteins for nuclear import. Nuclear protein import was significantly stimulated in stretched cells when compared with control. This was associated with an increase in the expression of nuclear pore proteins as detected by Western blots. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway blocked the stretch-induced stimulation of both cell proliferation and nuclear protein import. We conclude that nuclear protein import and nuclear pore density can adapt to mechanical stimuli during the process of cell growth through a MAPK-mediated mechanism.

Under normal conditions, the vessel wall is subjected to hemodynamic forces that can stretch the large arteries up to 10% (1Spofford C.M. Chilian W.M. Am. J.

Cell growth in the form of hyperplasia and/or cell hypertrophy is an active process that requires cells to enter the cell cycle through the induction of cell cycle regulatory proteins (11Batetta B.

The mechanism through which mechanical stretch induces cell growth is important to understand to control the development of diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cancer (2Irace C. Cortese C. Fiaschi E. Carallo C. Farinaro E. Gnasso A. Stroke. 2004; 35: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Shaw A. Xu Q. Curr. Vasc.

Many cell surface factors have been identified to be involved, including platelet-derived growth factor receptors (4Shaw A. Xu Q. Curr. Vasc.

Acta. 1995; 1241: 425-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, this represents only a portion of the cellular pathway to induce growth. It is also possible that the nucleus itself may be a target of mechanical stimuli. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) present on the surface of the nuclear membrane mediates the transport of transcription factors, cell cycle proteins, and signaling proteins into the nucleus to induce cell differentiation, transformation, and proliferation (17Allen T.D. Cronshaw J.M. Bagley S. Kiseleva E. Goldberg M.W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bagley S. Goldberg M.W. Cronshaw J.M. Rutherford S. Allen T.D. J.

Clearly, gene expression and transcription in any cell changes during a growth phase. However, it is still unknown if these changes occur through adaptive changes in nuclear transport in response to physiological and pathological stimuli. Any change in nuclear protein import may take place in concert with or independently of a change in NPC density. It is known that general changes in cell metabolism may influence NPC density (20Maul G.G. Deaven L.L. Freed J.J. Campbell G.L. Becak W. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1980; 26: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but beyond that, little is known. There are no data available to determine if mechanical stretch can induce alterations in nuclear protein import or NPC expression and what specific factors, if any, are involved in the changes. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine if the effects of mechanical strain can cause alterations in nuclear pore density and nuclear protein import in vascular smooth muscle cells and the mechanisms involved in these changes. Antibodies and Reagents—The following antibodies were used: proliferating cell nuclear antigen and smooth muscle α-actin (Sigma), signaling antibodies p38, phospho-p38, p44/p42, and phospho-p44/p42 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), nuclear pore protein antibodies mAb414 and NUP 153 (BabCO, Richmond, VA), and loading control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Secondary antibodies used were anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and Alexa488 anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). Other reagents purchased included PD-98059 and SB-202190 (Calbiochem) calcein AM and Alexa488 BSA conjugate (BODIPY-FL conjugate-BSA) (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). Cell Culture—Smooth muscle cells were isolated from the thoracic aorta of New Zealand White rabbits, as described previously (21Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, aortic rings were placed in a culture plate containing DMEM, 20% fetal bovine serum, and 10% fungizone. The rings were incubated for several days then transferred to a new plate to allow the migration of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The aortic tissue was then removed to allow the cells to grow to confluency (DMEM plus 5% fetal bovine serum plus 2% fungizone). Cells were trypsinized and seeded at a density of 40,000 cells per well in 6-well bioflex plates coated with Type 1 collagen. Cells were left to attach to the membranes for 24 h and maintained in starvation media (DMEM, 5 μg/ml holo-transferrin, 1 mm sodium selenite, 200 μm ascorbate, 10 mm insulin, 2.5 μm sodium pyruvate, and 2% fungizone) for 3 days prior to stretch. Mechanical Stretch—Mechanical stimulation was performed using a Flexcell 4000 cell stretch vacuum system. VSMCs plated on bioflex plates were supplemented with media (DMEM plus 5% fetal bovine serum plus 2% fungizone). Stoppers were inserted under the membranes of non-stretched controls. Pulsatile stretch was performed using a frequency of 1 Hz and an elongation of 20% for 24 or 48 h. Microinjection and Measurement of Nuclear Protein Import by Confocal Microscopy—Thin walled glass capillary tubes (1.0 mm, 3 inch) were used to fashion micropipettes for cell injection. The capillary tubes were made using a Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Model p-97). After stretch, the bioflex membranes containing the cells were carefully removed with a scalpel and placed in a Leyden dish containing 1 ml of pre-warmed perfusate buffer (6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dextrose, 6 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were maintained at 37 °C using a microperfusion chamber. An Alexa-BSA NLS fluorescent substrate was prepared in our laboratory by conjugating BODIPY-BSA to a SV40 large T antigen NLS (CGGGPKKKRKVED) (21Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The substrate was added to a micropipette, which was then inserted into the cell cytoplasm using an MS314 micromanipulator (Fine Science Tools). Cells were injected using a PV830 Pneumatic PicoPump (World Precision Instruments) and the pipette was slowly removed. In control experiments, cells remained viable for >10 h. Images of the cell after microinjection were acquired on a Bio-Rad MRC600 CLSM. Images were taken of the pre- and post-injected cells to observe the rate of nuclear import of the Alexa-BSA NLS fluorescent protein for each cell over time. There is no movement of the fluorescent marker into the cell nucleus when it does not contain an NLS. As discussed previously (21Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Faustino R.S. Czubryt M.P. Pierce G.N. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 352: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the use of this marker protein is advantageous because, instead of measuring the import of one specific protein, it identifies regulatory factors and pathways applicable to the nuclear import of all proteins. Final images were analyzed and processed on an SGI workstation using the Molecular Dynamics Imagespace image analysis software. Immunoblotting—Protein samples were prepared using 30 μg of protein in 2× Sample Buffer (0.15 m Tris, pH 6.8, 1.2% SDS, 30% glycerol, 15% β-mercaptoethanol, 1.8% bromphenol blue) and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and placed in blocking buffer (10% skim milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with the 1° antibody in Tris-buffered saline, 1% skim milk, and 0.05% Tween 20. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h in a solution containing 1% skim milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20, and the 2° antibody (i.e. a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig). The membrane was then visualized with the ECL detection system (Pierce), and images were created using a Fluores-max instrument and quantified using Quantity One imaging software. Immunocytochemistry—For the detection of mAb414, SM α-actin, and NF-κB, cells grown on Flex membranes were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X. Cells were washed and incubated with blocking buffer (10% skim milk powder, 1× Tris-buffered saline) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with the 1° antibody in Tris-buffered saline and 1% skim milk overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed and incubated with 1× Tris-buffered saline and the 2° antibody (i.e. Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig) for 1 h in the dark. The cells were rinsed, treated with Hoescht for 5 min, and inverted on a microscope slide using 10 μlof Fluorosave reagent. Images were collected on a Zeiss fluorescent microscope using a 63× oil immersion objective. Total fluorescence was measured to determine any differences in nuclear pore density and nuclear area was calculated by staining DNA with Hoescht. Each experiment consisted of averaging data from ∼75–100 cells for both stretched and non-stretched groups. Determination of Intracellular Signaling Mechanisms—After stretching, control and stretched cell groups were microinjected with specific MAPK inhibitors (i.e. SB202190 and PD98059). Micropipettes contained the Alexa-BSA NLS substrate and either 1 μm SB-202190 or 1 μm PD98059, and injected into VSMCs to measure nuclear protein import rate. Control and stretched cell groups were also treated with media (DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 2% fungizone) containing 1 μm PD98059 during the 48-h stretching regimen. Cell lysates were collected, and Western blots were analyzed to determine changes in nuclear pore protein expression as well as the phosphorylation status of phospho-p42. Statistical Analysis—Variation between means was determined using one-way analysis of variance followed by Duncan’s Posthoc test and significance was set at p < 0.05. Mechanical Stretch of VSMCs Stimulates Cell Growth—VSMCs were mechanically stretched to stimulate cell growth. After 48 h of stretch, the cells exhibited a significant 5-fold increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression when compared with non-stretched control cells (Fig. 1A). This would suggest that the stretched cells were actively entering the cell cycle. Cell counts confirmed that the cells were completing the cell cycle. There was a significant increase in cell number in a time-dependent manner as a function of the stretch stimulus (Fig. 1B). Both of these effects were blocked in the presence of a MAPK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 1, A and B). Cell hypertrophy is another type of cell growth that may be stimulated by cell stretching. Cell hypertrophy was determined using the cytoplasmic probe calcein AM to measure total cell volume. Cells stimulated by stretching exhibited a significant increase in cell size compared with the non-stretched control group (Fig. 1C). This too was blocked in the presence of 1 μm PD98059. These results demonstrate that mechanical stretching is capable of inducing both hyperplasia and hypertrophy in the SMCs and that this appears to occur in an MAPK-dependent manner. Involvement of the MAPK Pathway in the Stretch-induced Stimulation of Cell Growth—Using antibodies against the phosphorylated form of p44/42, Western blots were performed to further identify the activation of this pathway. Stretched cell lysates exhibited a significant increase in the levels of phospho-p44/42 when compared with the non-stretched control groups (Fig. 2). This was reversed after treatment with 1 μm PD98059 during stretching (Fig. 2). PD98059 induced no effect when stretching was not present. Effects of Mechanical Stretching on Nuclear Protein Import—VSMCs were subjected to stretch and microinjected with Alexa488-BSA NLS-conjugated fluorescent substrate to visualize nuclear import rate in cells over time. Nuclear protein import increased in cells after stretching in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3). We examined the maximal rate of import during the initial period of transport. For the first 10 min after injection, import occurred in a linear fashion (R2 value = 0.98, 0.98, and 0.97 in control cells or cells after 24 or 48 h of stretch, respectively). Cells stretched for 48 h had the largest increase in nuclear import; therefore, subsequent experiments were focused on this time point. Involvement of the MAPK Pathway in the Stretch-induced Stimulation of Nuclear Protein Import—The mechanisms mediating the stretch-induced effects on nuclear import were unknown. The data in Figs. 1 and 2 would suggest that the MAPK pathway may be important in mediating the effects of stretching on cell growth. In addition, previous work in our laboratory has identified the MAPKs as an important regulatory pathway in nuclear protein import (21Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Faustino R.S. Rousseau D.C. Landry M.N. Kostenuk A.L. Pierce G.N. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2006; 84: 469-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Faustino R.S. Stronger L.N. Richard M.N. Czubryt M.P. Ford D.A. Prociuk M.A. Dibrov E. Pierce G.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, MAPK inhibitors were again used to determine the role of the MAPK pathway as a potential mechanism for the stretch-induced effects on nuclear protein import. Both the p38 and MEK inhibitors SB202190 and PD98059, respectively, were able to reverse the effects of stretching on nuclear protein import (Fig. 4). The changes in nuclear fluorescence were apparent whether the measurements were expressed as total fluorescence or as nuclear/cytosolic fluorescence. There was also a small decrease in fluorescent intensity with the use of PD98059 below control values. These data would suggest that there may be a modest activation of the MAPK pathway in control cells as they adhere and “mildly stretch” onto the surface of the culture plate. It is important to note, however, that this is not a statistically significant decrease below control values. PD98059 is an MEK inhibitor. We also used the more selective p38 inhibitor SB202190 to determine if it could reverse the effects of stretch on nuclear protein import (Fig. 4, C and D). Its effects were similar to those of PD98059. Effects of Stretch on Nuclear Pore Density—Nuclear protein import may be altered through a direct increase in the number of nuclear pore channels. Immunocytochemistry revealed a significant increase in nuclear pore protein (as detected by mAb414 fluorescence) in stretched cells when compared with non-stretched controls (Fig. 5). This was evident if the fluorescence was plotted as absolute values or as a percentage of control. To confirm and quantitate this, cell lysates were collected from stretched and control groups and run on SDS-PAGE gels. Western blots were probed with antibodies against two different nuclear pore proteins using mAb414 and NUP153. Both p62 protein expression (using the mAb414 antibody) (Fig. 6A) and NUP153 (Fig. 6B) were significantly increased in stretched cells when compared with control. The presence of PD98059 blocked these effects.FIGURE 6Nuclear pore protein expression increased in cells stimulated by stretch. Western blots probed with two monoclonal nuclear pore protein antibodies and mAb414 for p62 (A) and NUP153 (B) revealed an increase in nuclear pore protein expression. Stretched cells exhibited a significant increase in p62 expression, which was blocked in both cases by the treatment with PD98059 during stretch (B). (*, p < 0.05 versus control, n = 3–5 independent experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Influence of Nuclear Size on Nuclear Pore Density—As shown in Fig. 1, stretching induced an increase in cell size. It is possible that this increase in cell size may have also induced an increase in nuclear size as well. If so, it is also possible that the increase in nuclear pore density was simply a reflection of the greater size of the nuclei. To determine if this was true, nuclear volume was measured by confocal microscopy and then this was plotted as a function of nuclear pore expression as indicated by p62 expression. As shown in Fig. 7, nuclear size was significantly increased in the cells after 48 h of stretch. However, the increase in p62 expression was still significantly elevated in comparison to control even when expressed as a ratio to nuclear size. Hypertension can increase overall cyclic mechanical strain on the arterial wall in the range of 15–30% (1Spofford C.M. Chilian W.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280 (–H1360): H1354PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shaw A. Xu Q. Curr. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2003; 1: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), leading to the pulsatile stretch of vascular SMCs within the medial layer of the vascular wall (1Spofford C.M. Chilian W.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280 (–H1360): H1354PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shaw A. Xu Q. Curr. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2003; 1: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cell growth is a hallmark response in adaptive remodeling of vascular arteries in response to hypertension (2Irace C. Cortese C. Fiaschi E. Carallo C. Farinaro E. Gnasso A. Stroke. 2004; 35: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Lee R.M. Owens G.K. Scott-Burden T. Head R.J. Mulvany M.J. Schiffrin E.L. Can J. Physiol.

VSMCs within the arterial wall are constantly exposed to a variety of flow-related mechanical stimuli (27Lehoux S. Tedgui A. J. Biomech. 2003; 36: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 28Kleinstreuer C. Hyun S. Buchanan Jr., J.R. Longest P.W. Archie Jr., J.P. Truskey G.A. Crit. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2001; 29: 1-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mechanical stimuli such as intermittent flow, pressure, turbulent flow, and stretching can induce significant changes in cell growth and alter cell shape (1Spofford C.M. Chilian W.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280 (–H1360): H1354PubMed Google Scholar, 29Owens G.K. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 30Owens G.K. Reidy M.A. Circ.

Physiol. 1989; 257 (–H1765): H1755PubMed Google Scholar). The pathophysiological mechanism underlying these changes is not well understood and remains to be determined. It has been suggested that VSMCs in the vessel wall can adapt in response to the mechanical forces induced by hypertension, and that mechanical stress may be involved in the progression of arteriosclerosis and medial vascular hypertrophy (5Li C. Xu Q. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used a physiological pulsatile stretch of 20% elongation at a frequency of 1 Hz (60 cycles/min) (33Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. Hypertension. 1996; 28: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 34Shyu K.G. Ko W.H. Yang W.S. Wang B.W. Kuan P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 68: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This amount of stretch was adequate to induce the cells to actively enter and complete the cell cycle. This stretching stimulus not only induced cell hyperplasia but also caused cellular hypertrophy. Our results are consistent with other studies that have shown this as well (29Owens G.K. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 30Owens G.K. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 1985; 57: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31Owens G.K. Schwartz S.M.

Despite considerable research effort (35Pauletto P. Sarzani R. Rappelli A. Chiavegato A. Pessina A.C. Sartore S. Am. J. Hypertens. 1994; 7: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 36Lehoux S. Tedgui A. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), the exact sequence of events within the cell that leads to vascular cell growth caused by stretching is not fully elucidated. To investigate the underlying intracellular mechanisms that lead to the increase in cell growth, we monitored the rate of nuclear protein import in VSMCs. Nuclear protein import can be an important regulatory step in gene expression (21Czubryt M.P. Austria J.A. Pierce G.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Jankowski R. Czubryt M.P. Pierce G.N. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2000; 44: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). For example, Perez-Terez et al. (38Perez-Terzic C. Behfar A. Mery A. van Deursen J.M. Terzic A. Puceat M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) reported that a depletion in Ca2+ or ATP/GTP in cardiac cells resulted in a closed state within the NPC and an inhibition of nuclear protein import. Maul et al. (39Maul H.M. Hsu B.Y. Borun T.M. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 59: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported that the prevention of ATP synthesis also leads to the inhibition of nuclear pore formation. Disturbances in ion channel homeostasis are common during cardiac hypertrophy leading to the depletion of Ca2+ stores that can directly result in a higher incidence of ischemic heart disease and heart failure (38Perez-Terzic C. Behfar A. Mery A. van Deursen J.M. Terzic A. Puceat M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Perez-Terez et al. (38Perez-Terzic C. Behfar A. Mery A. van Deursen J.M. Terzic A. Puceat M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) concluded that the inhibition in nuclear protein import directly contributes to the progression of disease. However, the import of proteins into the nucleus is but one step in the process of gene expression and may or may not be changed by a physiological stimulus like mechanical stretching. Although it is clear that complete blockade of import will have drastic changes on cell viability and growth, the effects of more subtle changes as may occur during physiological and pathological conditions are unknown. Surprisingly little is known about the plasticity of nuclear protein import in cells in situ. Therefore, it was important to study whether mechanical stretching of VSMCs leads to a direct increase in the rate of nuclear protein import. In our study, mechanical stretching of VSMCs resulted in an increased rate of nuclear protein import. Thus, nuclear protein import may represent an important regulatory point in the control of cell growth in the vasculature during mechanical stretching. The mechanism responsible for this adaptive response in nuclear protein import requires further study. One potential mechanism for the increased rate of nuclear protein import may be due to a direct increase in the number of nuclear pores present on the nuclear envelope. Mechanical stretching did cause an increase in nuclear size but the increase in pore expression was significantly greater than the increase in nuclear size, thus suggesting that pore density increased as well. The increase in NPC expression was shown by both immunocytochemical analyses and Western blots. This finding is consistent with recent data that have shown that cells contain more NPCs when the nucleus is more active in transcription (20Maul G.G. Deaven L.L. Freed J.J. Campbell G.L. Becak W. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1980; 26: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Maul H.M. Hsu B.Y. Borun T.M. Maul G.G. J.

NPCs have been described as both mobile and dynamically adaptable structures, especially under metabolic and hypertrophic stress (38Perez-Terzic C. Behfar A. Mery A. van Deursen J.M. Terzic A. Puceat M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 43Perez-Terzic C. Gacy A.M. Bortolon R. Dzeja P.P. Puceat M. Jaconi M. Prendergast F.G. Terzic A. Circ.

Cell Biol. 1972; 55: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Studies using green fluorescent protein-tagged nucleoporins have revealed free moving NPCs within the nuclear envelope as well as the formation of NPC clusters (45Doye V. Hurt E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Our data argue strongly that mechanical stretching can also induce a significant increase in nuclear pore number. Therefore, we can conclude that an increase in nuclear pore number may be at least one of the underlying mechanisms for the increase in the rate of nuclear protein import. It was hypothesized that an intracellular signaling mechanism may also be involved in the increase in nuclear protein import, NPC expression, and vascular cell growth. MAPKs are a group of signal transduction pathways (6Hosokawa H. Aiuchi S. Kambe T. Hagiwara Y. Kubo T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 1588-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that may play a role in the progression of vascular diseases such as hypertension and ischemic heart disease (5Li C. Xu Q. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 46Li C. Hu Y. Mayr M. Xu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that MAPKs are rapidly activated in response to elevated levels of mechanical stretching (2Irace C. Cortese C. Fiaschi E. Carallo C. Farinaro E. Gnasso A. Stroke. 2004; 35: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 5Li C. Xu Q. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 6Hosokawa H. Aiuchi S. Kambe T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Our results as well as others (4Shaw A. Xu Q. Curr. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2003; 1: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) show a significant increase in the phosphorylated state of p44/42 (ERK2) due to mechanical stretching, and the effects of stretching on cell growth were blocked by inhibitors of the MAPK pathway. Previous work in our laboratory using permeabilized cell assays and microinjection techniques has shown that ERK2 has the capacity to increase nuclear protein import (24Faustino R.S. Rousseau D.C. Landry M.N. Kostenuk A.L. Pierce G.N. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2006; 84: 469-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Faustino R.S. Stronger L.N. Richard M.N. Czubryt M.P. Ford D.A. Prociuk M.A. Dibrov E. Pierce G.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It was reasonable, therefore, to assess the MAPK pathway as a mechanism for the stretch-induced changes in nuclear protein import. The ERK and p38 MAPK inhibitors, PD98059 and SB202190, respectively, blocked the stimulatory effects of mechanical stretching on nuclear protein import and cell proliferation (24Faustino R.S. Rousseau D.C. Landry M.N. Kostenuk A.L. Pierce G.N. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2006; 84: 469-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Faustino R.S. Stronger L.N. Richard M.N. Czubryt M.P. Ford D.A.

It may be concluded from these results that the MAPK pathway plays an active role in the stretch-induced increase in nuclear protein import and cell proliferation and that the two processes are closely integrated in response to mechanical stretching. In addition, although it was not statistically significant, the dramatic down-regulation in NPC expression induced by PD98059 would suggest that it may have a role to play in this process as well. In summary, these results suggest that mechanical stretching induces a high level of activation of the MAPK pathway and this is directly involved in the up-regulation of nuclear protein import and NPC expression. The increased import of specific proteins into the nucleus (i.e. transcription factors) could directly lead to the activation of genes that cause cell proliferation and hypertrophy. If uncontrolled, this could lead to the progression of proliferative diseases like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cancer (9Hollander W. Am. J. Cardiol. 1976; 38: 786-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results, therefore, may have additional significance to identify targets for the treatment of cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2150540788,"Hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor for diabetic heart failure. However, the mechanisms that mediate hyperglycemia-induced cardiac damage remain poorly understood. The transcription factor GATA4 is essential for cardiac homeostasis, and its protein levels are dramatically reduced in the heart in response to diverse pathologic stresses. In this study, we investigated if hyperglycemia affects GATA4 expression in cardiomyocytes and if enhancing GATA4 signaling could attenuate hyperglycemia-induced cardiomyocyte injury. In cultured rat cardiomyocytes, high glucose (HG, 25 or 40 mm) markedly reduced GATA4 protein levels as compared with normal glucose (NG, 5.5 mm). Equal amount of mannitol did not affect GATA4 protein expression (NG, 100 ± 12%; mannitol, 97 ± 8%, versus HG, 43 ± 16%, p < 0.05). The GATA4 mRNA content, either steady-state or polysome-associated, remained unchanged. HG-induced GATA4 reduction was reversed by MG262, a specific proteasome inhibitor. HG did not activate the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in cardiomyocytes as indicated by a UPS reporter, nor did it increase the peptidase activities or protein expression of the proteasomal subunits. However, the mRNA levels of ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) were markedly increased in HG-treated cardiomyocytes. CHIP overexpression promoted GATA4 protein degradation, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated CHIP knockdown prevented HG-induced GATA4 depletion. Moreover, overexpression of GATA4 blocked HG-induced cardiomyocyte death. Also, GATA4 protein levels were diminished in the hearts of streptozotocin and db/db diabetic mice (44 ± 7% and 67 ± 13% of control, p < 0.05), which correlated with increased CHIP mRNA abundance. In summary, increased GATA4 protein degradation may be an important mechanism that contributes to hyperglycemic cardiotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1994366041,"Higher eukaryote genomes contain repetitive DNAs, often concentrated in transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin. Although repetitive DNAs are not typically considered as regulatory elements that directly affect transcription, they can contain binding sites for some transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate that binding of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) to the mouse major α-satellite repetitive DNA sequesters C/EBPα in the transcriptionally inert pericentromeric heterochromatin. We find that this sequestration reduces the transcriptional capacity of C/EBPα. Functional sequestration of C/EBPα was demonstrated by experimentally reducing C/EBPα binding to the major α-satellite DNA, which elevated the concentration of C/EBPα in the non-heterochromatic subcompartment of the cell nucleus. The reduction in C/EBPα binding to α-satellite DNA was induced by the co-expression of the transcription factor Pit-1, which removes C/EBPα from the heterochromatic compartment, and by the introduction of an altered-specificity mutation into C/EBPα that reduces binding to α-satellite DNA but permits normal binding to sites in some gene promoters. In both cases the loss of α-satellite DNA binding coincided with an elevation in the binding of C/EBPα to a promoter and an increased transcriptional output from that promoter. Thus, the binding of C/EBPα to this highly repetitive DNA reduced the amount of C/EBPα available for binding to and regulation of this promoter. The functional sequestration of some transcription factors through binding to repetitive DNAs may represent an underappreciated mechanism controlling transcription output. Higher eukaryote genomes contain repetitive DNAs, often concentrated in transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin.

The functional sequestration of some transcription factors through binding to repetitive DNAs may represent an underappreciated mechanism controlling transcription output. The eukaryotic cell nucleus is highly structured into subdomains of specialized function that include compartments of high and low transcriptional capacity, the euchromatin and heterochromatin (for review, see Refs. 1Isogai Y. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 1-8Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Kosak S.T. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 3Misteli T.

Biol. 2005; 21: 133-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The most transcriptionally inactive compartment, constitutive heterochromatin, consists typically of repetitive DNAs and specialized, highly compact chromatin concentrated near centromeres or telomeres (5Henikoff S. Ahmad K. Malik H.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1098-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 6Lamb, J. C., and Birchler, J. A. (2003) genomebiology.com/2003/4/5/214Google Scholar). Although repetitive DNAs retain their historic label as “junk” DNA, they play an important role in chromosomal segregation as an essential structural component of the centromere (7Schueler M.G. Higgins A.W. Rudd M.K. Gustashaw K. Willard H.F. Science. 2001; 294: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In addition, the heterochromatic chromosomal domains repress the activity of nearby genes (2Kosak S.T. Groudine M.

The correlation between repetitive DNA binding and targeting to heterochromatin is strengthened by a report that treatment of a preadipocyte cell line with growth hormone enhances targeting of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) 2The abbreviations used are: C/EBPβ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β; C/EBPα, C/EBP α; α-satellite DNA, mouse major α-satellite DNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; C/EBP-RE, C/EBP response element; WT, wild-type; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GH, growth hormone; WT, wild type. to heterochromatin and the ability of that factor to bind a repetitive DNA in vitro (17Piwien Pilipuk G.

In the current study, we identify methods to preferentially block the binding of a transcription factor to repetitive DNA and then follow the effects of that intervention on promoter binding and activation. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) is a transcription factor important to the differentiation and transcriptional regulation of a number of cell types (25Darlington G.J. Wang N. Hanson R.W.

In addition to binding and activating a large number of gene promoters, C/EBPα also is capable of binding in vitro to the mouse major α-satellite repetitive DNA (11Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The major α-satellite DNA repeat (referred to hereafter as α-satellite DNA) is prevalent at murine pericentromeric heterochromatin (29Joseph A. Mitchell A.R. Miller O.J. Exp.

Endogenous C/EBPα expressed upon differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes concentrates strongly at the pericentromeric heterochromatin (11Tang Q.Q.

The concentration of C/EBPα at pericentromeric heterochromatin is an intrinsic property of C/EBPα as C/EBPα ectopically expressed in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells and in pituitary progenitor cells also concentrates there (31Schaufele F.

The ability to mimic the intranuclear localization with ectopically expressed proteins enabled us to manipulate C/EBPα and establish that the conserved bZIP domain of C/EBPα was necessary and sufficient for ectopically expressed C/EBPα to target to pericentromeric heterochromatin (21Liu, W., Enwright, J.

Methods. 2001; 25: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We also showed previously that the concentration of C/EBPα in transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin is highly regulated by the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1 that translocates C/EBPα from a pericentromeric to a non-pericentromeric distribution in the pituitary progenitor cell model (31Schaufele F.

Here, we provide experimental evidence that specific binding of C/EBPα binding to α-satellite DNA sequesters C/EBPα in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of the cell nucleus. Furthermore, the regulated translocation of C/EBPα away from the pericentromeric heterochromatin (31Schaufele F. Enwright J.F.I. Wang X. Teoh C. Srihari R. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Day R.N. Mol.

This indicates that transcription factor binding to repetitive DNA can act as a direct negative regulator of transcriptional activity. The impact of repetitive DNA binding on the activity of other transcription factors remains unknown, but this report suggests that it is a facet of transcription regulation that should be considered for some factors. Imaging—Cells were stained with anti-C/EBPα C-18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-9314, Santa Cruz, CA) and a rhodamine-linked anti-IgG secondary antibody, then counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) as described (32Schaufele F. Wang X. Liu X. Day R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10578-10587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with anti-C/EBPα antibodies sc-9315 or sc-61 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Representative images were acquired confocally with a 63× 1.40 NA oil immersion objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) (Fig. 1). To quantify the location of C/EBPα relative to pericentromeric heterochromatin (Fig. 2B), wide-field microscope images were acquired using a 40× 0.95 NA air objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The relative positions of the anti-C/EBPα-stained material and the Hoechst 33342-stained pericentromeric heterochromatin were quantified from >50 cells for each mutant using the correlation plot functions of Metamorph (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA) as described (32Schaufele F. Wang X. Liu X. Day R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10578-10587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For these quantitative studies, cells were stained with the M2 antibody against the FLAG epitope (Sigma) that was added to the amino terminus of all mutants to ensure equivalent immuno-detection of the different mutants.FIGURE 2Mutations that disrupt C/EBPα concentration at pericentromeric heterochromatin also disrupt binding to α-satellite DNA.

TA domains, transcriptional activation domains; b, basic region; ZIP, leucine zipper. Blocks of amino acids conserved among C/EBP proteins from different species and with selected bZIP proteins are indicated as a black bar. Numbers represent amino acid positions. C/EBPα mutants are named according to the amino acids that were mutated (e.g. X60A/X61A/X62A (X60–62A)). The known activities affected by these mutations are briefly described under “Results.” X67–69A, X67A/X68A/X69A; X76–78A, X76A/X77A/X78A; X63–65A, X63A/X64A/X65A; X146–148A, X146A/X147AA/X148A. B, co-localization of antibody-stained C/EBPα with Hoechst-33342 stained C/EBPα was quantified from multiple cells as a correlation coefficient for WT and mutant C/EBPα expressed in GHFT1-5 cells (mean ± S.D., n > 50 cells for each). A correlation coefficient of +1.0 indicates complete co-localization; 0.0 indicates no relationship; –1.0 indicates completely opposite localization. *, mutants with correlation coefficients significantly (p ≪ 0.001) less than for wild-type C/EBPα. There is no correlation coefficient for cells transfected with vector alone since there is no C/EBPα present.

D, representative gel mobility shift of radiolabeledα-satellite DNA by wild-type C/EBPα and the indicated mutants present in the nuclear extracts of GHFT1-5 cells.

Enwright J.F.I. Wang X. Teoh C. Srihari R. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Day R.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1665-1676PubMed Google Scholar). GHFT1-5 cells were transfected with the Rc-C/EBPα expression vector (FLAG epitope-tagged C/EBPα cDNA subcloned into the Rc/CMV expression vector of Invitrogen) using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). 3T3-L1 cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Point mutations were introduced into the C/EBPα expression vector using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and were confirmed by complete sequencing of the C/EBPα cDNA. The C/EBPα-Gal expression vectors were constructed by inserting the Gal4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) amplified from the pM vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in-frame between C/EBPα amino acids 308 and 309 in the Rc-C/EBPα vector. The nucleotide sequence of the three-amino acid-long spacer linking C/EBPα amino acid 308 (underlined) to Gal4 amino acid 1 (underlined) is CTCAAGCTTCCCAAG. Extract Preparation and Western Blotting—Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared from cells transfected with the Rc/CMV or Rc-C/EBPα wild-type or mutant expression vectors, as previously described (36Schaufele F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein amount in the extracts was determined by the Coomassie Plus protein assay (Pierce). Expression of C/EBPα and mutants was assessed by Western blots of equal amounts of protein in each extract using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or the anti-C/EBPα 14AA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-61), a species-appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Levels of expression for the different mutants (Fig. 2C) in the nuclear extracts were quantified by densitometry of unsaturated films from anti-FLAG-probed extracts from three independent experiments. None of the C/EBPα mutants was observed in the cytoplasmic extracts. DNA Binding—Nuclear extracts were used in gel mobility shift assays of radiolabeled α-satellite DNA (Figs. 2D and 3C) or of radiolabeled oligonucleotides representing the previously described C/EBPα binding sites found at –230 in the growth hormone promoter (37Schaufele F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21484-21489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or at –68 in the PU.1 promoter (38Kummalue T. Friedman A.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Figs. 3, A and B, and 5B). α-Satellite DNA was prepared by polymerase chain reaction from total genomic DNA extracted from GHFT1-5 cells using the primers TGGAATATGGCGAGATAACTGAAAATCACGG and AGGTCCTTCAGTGTGCATTTCTCATTT. The 234-bp single copy of α-satellite DNA was gel-purified from higher multiples of this tandem repetitive element and represents the population of α-satellite DNAs present in those cells. Similar results were obtained when the gel shift experiments were conducted with subcloned, single-copy, radiolabeled α-satellite DNAs (not shown). Specific C/EBPα binding to all sites was demonstrated by supershifts of the gel-shifted bands with the anti-FLAG M2 or 14AA antibodies and by competition with excess unlabeled α-satellite DNA (not shown). Quantitative comparison of subsaturating equilibrium binding by wild type and V296A (Fig. 3) was done by mixing 4 μg of total extract, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and radiolabeled DNA. The amounts of probe bound by wild-type and mutant C/EBPα were quantified by densitometry of unsaturated films using extracts of three independent transfections. The removal of rabbit reticulocyte lysate-translated C/EBPα by the addition of rabbit reticulocyte-translated Pit-1 (Fig. 3C) was done under the same binding conditions.FIGURE 5Superactivity by the V296A mutation is not associated with enhanced intrinsic transcriptional activity. A, full-length V296A superactivates the C/EBP-RE reporter (see Fig. 4) in both undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells and GHFT1-5 cells. *, promoter activation of V296A C/EBPα that is significantly greater than WT C/EBPα. B, intrinsic transcriptional activity was measured as the amount of luciferase expressed from a promoter containing Gal4 binding sites upon co-expression of fusions with the Gal4 DNA binding domain with amino acids 1–308 of the wild-type or V296A mutant C/EBPα. There was no activation by the Gal4 DNA binding domain alone or by either wild-type or mutant C/EBPα (amino acids 1–308). Data represent the mean ± S.D. from six (GHFT1-5 (A)), four (3T3-L1 (A)), or three (GHFT1-5 and 3T3-L1 (B)) independent experiments.

The C/EBP-RE reporter (Figs. 4 and 5) consists of a single C/EBPα binding site of the rat growth hormone promoter (–239/–219) inserted upstream of the TATA box of the GH promoter (–33/+8) appended to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter (37Schaufele F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21484-21489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Gal-RE reporter (Fig. 4) is the modified GK1 reporter (39Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J.

The reporters were co-transfected with the Rc/CMV (“vector”), Rc-C/EBPα wild-type, or mutant expression vectors. The –85/+158 fragment of the PU.1 promoter was inserted in front of the luciferase reporter (38Kummalue T. Friedman A.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and co-transfected with the C/EBPα expression vectors and with a FLAG-tagged Pit-1 cDNA in the Rc/CMV expression vector or with an equivalent amount of Rc/CMV itself. The GK1 and PU.1 reporter vectors were kindly provided by Drs. Paul Webb (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and Alan Friedman (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), respectively. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Two days after transfection with expression vectors, chromosomal DNA was formaldehyde-cross-linked to protein in ∼10 × 106 intact GHFT1-5 cells for 10 min then glycine-quenched. Genomic DNA was isolated and sheered to an average length of 200–1000 bp by sonication. 300 μg of sheered DNA was precleared by binding to protein G-Sepharose beads, and the cross-linked C/EBPα-DNA complexes were precipitated with anti-C/EBPα (C-18) antibodies. The precipitated DNA was heat-released to remove cross-links to the precipitated C/EBPα, and 1/25th of the resulting DNA was amplified by 12 PCR cycles using α-satellite DNA primers (see DNA binding analysis for primers) or by 31 PCR cycles using PU.1 primers (CGACCGGAGCAGCAGAAG and CAAGTTCCTGATTTTATCGAAG). The amount of ethidium bromide-stained amplified DNA was measured only for subsaturating rounds of amplification; the 234-bp “monomeric” α-satellite product and the 239-bp PU.1 gene product were quantified against the amounts of DNA amplified from 2.5% of input DNA. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—GHFT1-5 cells were transfected with the IRES-GFP vector (Invitrogen) or the same vector containing wild-type or V296A mutant C/EBPα cDNAs. The transfected cells were isolated as green fluorescent cells using a MoFlo cell sorter (DakoCytomation, Fort Collins, CO). RNA was extracted and quantified by real time reverse transcription-PCR using 5′ fluorogenic nuclease techniques. RNA expressed from the endogenous PU.1 gene was detected after initial cDNA synthesis, with amplification primers in exons 3 and 4 (CGTCCTCGATACTCCCATGGT and AAGGTTTGATAAGGGAAGCACATC) and an intron/exon-spanning probe (6FAM-TCAGTCACCAGGTTTCCTACATGCCCC-BHQ1) created by Drs. Scott Kogan and David Ginziger (University of California San Francisco Comprehensive Cancer Center). The number of cycles required to reach threshold detection were compared against a similarly detected internal control for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) expression (Applied Biosystems Mm00446968_m1, Foster City, CA and similarly designed probes from David Ginziger at the University of California San Francisco Comprehensive Cancer Center) and corrected for differing efficiencies of amplification for the PU.1 and HPRT probes determined in cDNA dilution experiments (40Pfaffl M.W.

https://openalex.org/W1968384507,"MUC4 is a transmembrane mucin, which is aberrantly expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma with no detectable expression in the normal pancreas. Here, we present a novel mechanism of IFN-γ-induced expression of MUC4 in pancreatic cancer cells. Our studies highlight the upregulation of STAT-1 as a basis for MUC4 induction and demonstrate that its activation and upregulation by IFN-γ are two distinct, albeit temporally integrated, signalling events that drive the selective induction of IRF-1 and MUC4, respectively, within a single cell system. The profile of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 gene induction by IFN-γ is consistent with its rapid transactivation by phospho-Y701-STAT-1. In contrast, the induction of the MUC4 mucin gene expression is relatively delayed, and occurs only in response to an increase in STAT-1 expression. A progressive binding of STAT-1 to various γ-interferon-activated sequences (GAS) in the MUC4 promoter is observed in chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, indicating its direct association. Stimulation of STAT-1 expression by double-stranded polynucleotides or ectopic expression is shown to induce MUC4 expression, without Y701 phosphorylation of STAT-1. This effect is abrogated by short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of STAT-1 expression, supporting further the relevance of STAT-1 in MUC4 regulation. In conclusion, our findings identify a novel mechanism for MUC4 regulation in pancreatic cancer cells and unfold new perspectives on the foundation of IFN-γ-dependent gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2017833724,"DM catalyzes the exchange of peptides bound to Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Because the dissociation and association components of the overall reaction are difficult to separate, a detailed mechanism of DM catalysis has long resisted elucidation. UV irradiation of DR molecules loaded with a photocleavable peptide (caged Class II MHC molecules) enabled synchronous and verifiable evacuation of the peptide-binding groove and tracking of early binding events in real time by fluorescence polarization. Empty DR molecules generated by photocleavage rapidly bound peptide but quickly resolved into species with substantially slower binding kinetics. DM formed a complex with empty DR molecules that bound peptide with even faster kinetics than empty DR molecules just having lost their peptide cargo. Mathematical models demonstrate that the peptide association rate of DR molecules is substantially higher in the presence of DM. We therefore unequivocally establish that DM contributes directly to peptide association through formation of a peptide-loading complex between DM and empty Class II MHC. This complex rapidly acquires a peptide analogous to the MHC class I peptide-loading complex. DM catalyzes the exchange of peptides bound to Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Because the dissociation and association components of the overall reaction are difficult to separate, a detailed mechanism of DM catalysis has long resisted elucidation. UV irradiation of DR molecules loaded with a photocleavable peptide (caged Class II MHC molecules) enabled synchronous and verifiable evacuation of the peptide-binding groove and tracking of early binding events in real time by fluorescence polarization. Empty DR molecules generated by photocleavage rapidly bound peptide but quickly resolved into species with substantially slower binding kinetics. DM formed a complex with empty DR molecules that bound peptide with even faster kinetics than empty DR molecules just having lost their peptide cargo. Mathematical models demonstrate that the peptide association rate of DR molecules is substantially higher in the presence of DM. We therefore unequivocally establish that DM contributes directly to peptide association through formation of a peptide-loading complex between DM and empty Class II MHC. This complex rapidly acquires a peptide analogous to the MHC class I peptide-loading complex. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 5The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; FP, fluorescence polarization; Anp, 3-amino-3-(2-nitro)phenyl-propionic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DNP, dinitrophenyl; MBP, myelin basic protein. molecules are cell surface proteins that present peptides to antigen-specific receptors on T cells. The Class II MHC products are specialized in sampling endosomal compartments to acquire these peptides. Delivery of newly synthesized and assembled Class II MHC proteins to endo-lysosomal compartments is assured by means of the transient association of the MHC αβ heterodimer with the invariant chain, a protein endowed with both chaperone function and an address code (1Roche P.A. Cresswell P. Nature. 1990; 345: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 2Bakke O. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1990; 63: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In endosomal compartments, the invariant chain is destroyed, yielding a Class II MHC product occupied with an invariant chain-derived remnant, the CLIP peptide (3Riberdy J.M. Newcomb J.R. Surman M.J.

The HLA-DM (DM) molecule, itself incapable of binding peptide, facilitates replacement of CLIP with antigenic peptides (6Denzin L.K. Cresswell P.

Such editing by DM favors presentation to CD4 T cells of those peptides that are most resistant to peptide displacement by DM (9Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E.

Med. 1996; 184: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). DM is a membrane-anchored heterodimer that belongs to the extended family of proteins with a MHC fold but lacks a functional peptide-binding groove (18Fremont D.H. Crawford F. Marrack P. Hendrickson W.A. Kappler J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Mosyak L. Zaller D.M. Wiley D.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 377-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis experiments identified lateral surfaces on DM and DR molecules that are involved in the interaction between the two proteins. On the DR side, these mutations span the entire length of the ectodomain and are localized to the α1 and β2 domains (20Doebele C.R. Busch R. Scott M.H. Pashine A. Mellins D.E. Immunity. 2000; 13: 517-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). On the DM side, an extended interaction surface has been mapped that also spans the entire length of the ectodomain (21Pashine A. Busch R. Belmares M.P. Munning J.N. Doebele R.C. Buckingham M. Nolan G.P. Mellins E.D. Immunity. 2003; 19: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These data support a model in which lateral interactions between DM and DR molecules induce a conformational change that destabilizes the DR-bound peptide. It has been proposed that DM disrupts one or several hydrogen bonds between the peptide backbone and conserved DR residues, which could account for the fact that DM accelerates dissociation of peptides that are highly diverse in sequence (12Weber D.A. Evavold B.D. Jensen P.E. Science. 1996; 274: 618-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 19Mosyak L. Zaller D.M. Wiley D.C.

Immunol. 2007; 8: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, DR-peptide complexes vary substantially in susceptibility to DM and peptide, and DR residues along the entire length of the binding site can affect susceptibility to DM (23Belmares M.P. Busch R. Wucherpfennig K.W. McConnell H.M. Mellins E.D. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5109-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These data suggest that DM causes a more global conformational change of the peptide-binding site. High affinity peptides form stable, long-lived complexes with DR molecules that have a half-life of days to weeks (24Lanzavecchia A. Reid P.A. Watts C. Nature. 1992; 357: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Purified, soluble DM greatly increases the rate at which labeled peptides dissociate from DR molecules at an acidic pH (6Denzin L.K. Cresswell P. Cell. 1995; 82: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 9Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 12Weber D.A. Evavold B.D. Jensen P.E. Science. 1996; 274: 618-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In such experiments, DM obviously also accelerates the binding of labeled peptides to DR molecules, but it has been difficult to discern whether accelerated peptide binding is solely due to the increased availability of binding sites or also due to a direct contribution of DM to peptide association. The detailed mechanism of DM catalysis has resisted elucidation, partly because of this difficulty of measuring independently the contributions to peptide dissociation and peptide association. Isolating the contribution of DM to peptide association would require a homogenous population of empty Class II MHC molecules in a peptide-receptive state. In theory, empty Class II MHC molecules could be generated by dissociating bound peptide, but empty molecules tend to aggregate during the prolonged incubation periods that would be required. An alternative approach that has been pursued consists of the production of recombinant molecules refolded from denatured DR chains in the absence of peptide, but the majority of such molecules (∼95%) bind peptides only slowly, apparently because conversion to more active conformer(s) is required (25Joshi R.V. Zarutskie J.A. Stern L.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3751-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Zarutskie J.A. Busch R. Zavala-Ruiz Z. Rushe M. Mellins E.D. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12450-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because of these technical challenges, two different models have been proposed regarding the interaction of DM with DR molecules. According to the first model, DM interacts only with DR-peptide complexes but not empty DR molecules and catalyzes the interconversion between transient and stable DR-peptide complexes (26Zarutskie J.A. Busch R. Zavala-Ruiz Z. Rushe M. Mellins E.D. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12450-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The second model proposes that DM interacts with both DR-peptide complexes and empty DR molecules and that DM acts as a molecular chaperone that rescues empty DR molecules at an acidic pH (27Denzin L.K. Hammond C. Cresswell P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2153-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 28Kropshofer H. Arndt S.O. Moldenhauer G. Hammerling G.J. Vogt A.B. Immunity. 1997; 6: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Resolution of this issue requires a novel approach with which empty DR molecules can be generated rapidly and synchronously. An intriguing new development has been the generation of conditional ligands for Class I MHC molecules. Toebes et al. (29Toebes M. Coccoris M. Bins A. Rodenko B. Gomez R. Nieuwkoop N.J. van de Kasteele W. Rimmelzwaan G.F. Haanen J.B. Ovaa H. Schumacher T.N. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) synthesized photocleavable ligands for Class I MHC molecules and reconstituted the relevant subunits into an assembled Class I MHC complex. UV irradiation resulted in cleavage of the bound peptide and rapid departure of the cleavage fragments from the binding pocket. Here, we apply this chemistry to generate empty Class II MHC molecules. The experiments make use of a human Class II MHC molecule, the expression of which predisposes its carrier to multiple sclerosis, HLA-DR2 (DRA, DRB1*1501), and a photocleavable peptide based on a T cell epitope of human myelin basic protein (MBP85-99) (30Smith K.J. Pyrdol J. Gauthier L. Wiley D.C. Wucherpfennig K.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 31Wucherpfennig K.W. Sette A. Southwood S. Oseroff C. Matsui M. Strominger J.L. Hafler D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Rapid, early binding events were followed with a fluorescence polarization (FP) readout, in which the fraction of emitted fluorescent light that retains polarization is proportional to the amount of MHC-bound fluorescent reporter peptide, because of a slower tumbling speed of the MHC-peptide complex compared with free peptide (32Nicholson M.J. Moradi B. Seth N.P. Xing X. Cuny G.D. Stein R.L. Wucherpfennig K.W. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 4208-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The presence of DM substantially accelerated peptide binding to such empty DR molecules under all of the reaction conditions tested. Mathematical models show excellent concordance with the experimental data for a model wherein DM contributes significantly to peptide association through formation of a complex with empty Class II MHC molecules. We propose that this DM-DR complex represents a peptide-loading complex that facilitates antigen presentation by rapid peptide capture, analogous to the MHC class I peptide-loading complex (33Cresswell P. Ackerman A.L. Giodini A. Peaper D.R. Wearsch P.A. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis and Photocleavage—Peptides were constructed manually with the aid of Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-based solid phase peptide chemistry using standard protocols. The photolabile 3-amino-3-(2-nitro)phenyl-propionic acid (Anp) residue was incorporated at the positions indicated in Fig. 1 as described previously (29Toebes M. Coccoris M. Bins A. Rodenko B. Gomez R. Nieuwkoop N.J. van de Kasteele W. Rimmelzwaan G.F. Haanen J.B. Ovaa H. Schumacher T.N. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Details of the synthesis of MBP-C647 and MBP-N647 are provided in the supplemental information. Photocleavage was examined by preparing a stock solution of lyophilized peptide in Me2SO (10 mg/ml). This stock was diluted in H2O, and 200-μl aliquots were added to a 96-well plate on ice. Two UV sources were used, both of which induced efficient photolysis: a Stratalinker 2400 UV cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) fitted with lamps emitting at a wavelength of 365 nm and a dedicated long wavelength UV lamp (Blak Ray B100AP, UVP, Upland, CA; wavelength of 365 nm). Aliquots were taken at different time points to determine the kinetics of photolysis by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. For liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, an HP/Agilent 1100 HPLC system (UV detection at 214 nm) equipped with an analytical C18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 3.5-μm particle size) was used in combination with buffers H2O, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid (A) and MeCN, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid (B), which was coupled to an LCT mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) with an electrospray interface. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed using a Waters MALDI Micromass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) and 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. Protein Expression and Purification—Soluble DR2 with covalently linked CLIP peptide (1 μm) was loaded with DNP-labeled photocleavable peptides (10 μm) following linker cleavage with thrombin (34Day C.L. Seth N.P. Lucas M. Appel H. Gauthier L. Lauer G.M. Robbins G.K. Szczepiorkowski Z.M. Casson D.R. Chung R.T. Bell S. Harcourt G. Walker B.D. Klenerman P. Wucherpfennig K.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) overnight at 30 °C in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1% octylglucoside, protected from light. Free peptide was removed from the protein complex by HPLC gel filtration (Superose 6, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp, Piscataway, NJ). The fraction containing the DR2-peptide complex was then affinity-purified on an anti-DNP HPLC column (34Day C.L. Seth N.P. Lucas M. Appel H. Gauthier L. Lauer G.M. Robbins G.K. Szczepiorkowski Z.M. Casson D.R. Chung R.T. Bell S. Harcourt G. Walker B.D. Klenerman P. Wucherpfennig K.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The yields of the purified complexes are listed in supplemental Table S1. Soluble DM was produced from stably transfected Drosophila melanogaster-derived S2 cells as described previously (9Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 35Busch R. Reich Z. Zaller D.M. Sloan V. Mellins E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27557-27564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). FP Assay—Association of MBP-488 was monitored by FP as described previously (32Nicholson M.J. Moradi B. Seth N.P. Xing X. Cuny G.D. Stein R.L. Wucherpfennig K.W. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 4208-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The assay was performed in black polystyrene 384-well flat bottom plates (Corning, Corning, NY) with a nonbinding surface, and the reactions were protected from external light and evaporation with an aluminum foil seal (Excel Scientific, Wrightwood, CA) when the plate was not in the reader. The data were acquired using a Victor3V plate reader (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) with 485/20 and 530/30 filter sets to track FP of the Alexa-488 (Invitrogen) label. Typically, the experiments were performed in citrate buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 5.2) in a final volume of 40 μl. FP values were recorded at ambient temperature. The data were acquired from triplicate wells, and wells that contained only the fluorescent MBP-488 peptide were used to determine base-line FP values. In experiments where FP was monitored in a cuvette, a QM-7 fluorometer was used (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville NJ). DR2-MBP-P4* was UV-cleaved at the same conditions as above but 7.5-fold concentrated relative to the binding reaction. MBP-488 was added to a quartz cuvette containing 1300 μl of buffer, and the FP followed over time to generate a base line and stabilize the temperature to 20 °C before DR2 and DM addition. Photocleaved DR2 with or without DM was rapidly injected in a volume of 200 μl into the cuvette using a spring-loaded 200-μl Hamilton syringe (CR700-200, Hamilton Company, Reno, NV). A small opening in the cover of the reader allowed the injection to be performed while the FP was being measured. The reaction was under constant mixing with a magnetic stirrer. FP values were measured for 10 min after DR2 addition at a speed of 1 reading/s. Binding of Photocleavable Peptides to DR2—Freshly cleaved DR2-CLIP complex (final concentration 100 nm) and MBP-488 (final concentration 10 nm) were added to citrate buffer containing 1% octylglucoside. Photocleavable DNP-labeled peptides were added to these reactions at different concentrations (3-fold dilution series, highest concentration of 250 μm) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The amount of bound MBP-488 was then determined by FP, and the ability of the photocleavable peptides to compete for binding of MBP-488 to DR2 was compared with the MBP85-99 index peptide (supplemental Table S1). Photocleavage and Exchange—In a typical experiment, a stock solution of DR2-MBP-P4* was deposited into several wells (maximum volume of 50 μl/well) of a 96-well V-bottom plate (Corning Inc., Corning, NY), placed on ice, and allowed to cool. In a separate 96-well plate (no UV control), the samples were shielded from UV light with aluminum foil but otherwise treated identically. The plates were then placed directly under a preheated UV lamp fitted with a UV source emitting at 365 nm (Blak Ray B100AP, UVP, Upland, CA). After 2-10 min of UV irradiation, the contents of wells were pooled (no signs of solvent evaporation were apparent at this point), and 30 μl were dispensed into appropriate wells of a 384-well plate, preloaded with MBP-488 alone or a mixture of DM and MBP-488. Following mixing, the 384-well plate was transferred to the FP reader. The FP values were measured at regular intervals, and the data was collected in triplicate. Separation of Empty DR2 Molecules from Cleavage Fragments—DR2-MBP-P4* was photocleaved at a concentration of 3 μm as described above. 1 ml of the photocleaved product was loaded onto a HPLC gel filtration column (Superose 6) with 50 mm sodium citrate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 5.2, as the mobile phase to separate free peptide fragments from empty DR2 molecules. The protein concentration in collected fractions was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce). The purified molecules were then assayed by FP for their ability to bind MBP-488. In each experiment, the purification and reaction set-up time required 1.5-2 h starting at the end of photocleavage. Design and Properties of Photocleavable Peptide Ligands—The structure of DR2 complexed with the MBP85-99 peptide (30Smith K.J. Pyrdol J. Gauthier L. Wiley D.C. Wucherpfennig K.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) served as the point of departure for the design of photocleavable ligands. We applied the strategy first described by Schumacher and co-workers (29Toebes M. Coccoris M. Bins A. Rodenko B. Gomez R. Nieuwkoop N.J. van de Kasteele W. Rimmelzwaan G.F. Haanen J.B. Ovaa H. Schumacher T.N. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) for Class I MHC products and synthesized peptides that contained an Anp residue at the indicated positions (Fig. 1A). Peptide binding to Class II MHC molecules is stabilized by cooperative hydrogen bond networks and anchor residues nestled deep into the peptide-binding groove (36Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). A panel of peptides was synthesized that placed the Anp residue between the known anchor residues Val89 (P1) and Phe92 (P4) and critical hydrogen bonds such that, upon cleavage, two fragments would be generated, neither of which was expected to fulfill the criteria for strong binding on its own. We refer to Class II MHC molecules loaded with a photocleavable ligand as caged Class II MHC products. The peptides (MBP-P1* to MBP-P5*) were further fitted with a DNP group through a 4-aminobutyric acid spacer to allow affinity purification of the properly loaded DR2 complex. A model based on the crystal structure of MBP85-99 illustrates the close proximity of the nitro-substituent on the aromatic ring to the backbone of MBP-P4* (Fig. 1B), which accounts for the photochemical liberation of the N-terminal amide and C-terminal nitroso-fragments at the relatively long wavelength of 365 nm, at which proteins are essentially transparent. Affinity of the Peptide Ligands for DR2 and Efficiency of Photocleavage—The peptide ligands were next used to generate complexes with DR2. A Chinese hamster ovary cell-derived DR2 preparation, in which the CLIP peptide was attached covalently to the DR2 β-chain, was exposed to thrombin, upon which the CLIP peptide could be readily exchanged in DM-independent fashion for other ligands. To avoid confounding effects of a mixture of DR2 loaded with MBP-P4*, DR2-CLIP, and empty DR2, a DNP moiety installed at the N terminus of the photocleavable peptide was used for retrieval of the correspondingly loaded DR2 molecules on an anti-DNP affinity matrix. This final purification step ensured that all DR2 molecules used as input for subsequent reactions were occupied homogeneously with the photocleavable peptide. We identified one MBP-derived ligand, MBP-P4*, for which the caged DR2 complex could be obtained in yields comparable with the DR2-MBP85-99 complex. The affinity of DR2 binding by photocleavable ligands (MBP-P1* to MBP-P5*) was explored by means of a competition assay (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S1), confirming that the substitution of Phe92 of the MBP85-99 peptide (the P4 anchor in context of DR2) for Anp least affected the affinity (3-fold) for DR2. Therefore, the caged complex that contained MBP-P4*, which most closely matched the affinity of the MBP85-99 index peptide for DR2, was chosen as substrate for peptide exchange reactions in the following experiments. Each of the photocleavable peptides was examined individually for its ability to undergo chromatic cleavage. Electron spray ionization mass spectroscopy was used to follow the disappearance of the dominant triple-charged ion species of the parent peptide. In the representative case of MBP-P4* (Fig. 2B), photocleavage was largely complete after 2 min of irradiation. Photocleavage proceeded with similar efficiency when the peptide was bound to DR2 (Fig. 2C). In addition to the expected reaction products of UV fragmentation that were identified with certainty (Fig. 2D), electron spray ionization mass spectroscopy as well as MALDI-TOF spectra showed several additional unidentified cleavage products, whereas the index MBP85-99 peptide was unaffected by UV irradiation (data not shown). Functional Properties of DR2 Molecules Synchronously Liberated from Bound Peptide—The ability to quickly arrive at an empty state allowed us to examine the association of peptides with Class II MHC and revisit the role of DM in peptide loading. This method differs significantly from published procedures that use refolded empty Class II MHC as a starting point (37Altman J.D. Reay P.A. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10330-10334Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Frayser M. Sato A.K. Xu L. Stern L.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Such preparations contain a mixture of species that actively bind peptide, that slowly convert to an active form, or that are inactive. Furthermore, the conformations that may be accessed by a properly loaded Class II MHC molecule upon loss of its peptide ligand may well differ from those of Class II MHC products generated in the complete absence of a ligand. Tracking of early stages of peptide association was important for examining the functional properties of DR2 molecules immediately following photocleavage of MBP-P4*. We used an Alexa-488-labeled version of the MBP85-99 peptide (MBP-488, Fig. 1A) as a fluorescent reporter peptide in the FP assay. In the absence of UV irradiation, the DR2-MBP85-99 complex was stable (Fig. 3B), showing no evidence for peptide exchange over the time course followed. The DR2-CLIP complex was less stable, with a slow increase in FP values over the 100-min observation window (Fig. 3C). In the absence of UV irradiation, the DR2-MBP-P4* complex showed peptide exchange behavior intermediate to that of the DR2-MBP85-99 and DR2-CLIP complexes (Fig. 3A, blue curve), consistent with their affinity rank order (MBP > MBP-P4* > CLIP). When the identical assay was performed upon UV irradiation, neither peptide binding to the preformed DR2-CLIP nor to the DR2-MBP85-99 complex was affected. In contrast, we observed a steep increase in peptide association for the DR2-MBP-P4* complex upon UV exposure (Fig. 3A, red curve). In this experiment, the MBP-488 reporter peptide was included during photocleavage, and the reaction had already proceeded significantly when the first data points could be recorded, even though photocleavage was performed for 2 min on ice. Therefore, in the absence of DM, rapid peptide association occurs to what we propose are newly vacated DR2 molecules. We then assessed the potential contribution of DM to MBP-488 association following photocleavage of the bound peptide. DM was added before photocleavage at an equimolar concentration relative to DR2 (150 nm), and MBP-488 was then added to measure peptide association. As shown above, the peptide binding reaction proceeded rapidly following photocleavage in the absence of DM, but DM further accelerated the rate of peptide association (Fig. 3D). There may be several explanations for this DM-dependent increase in the kinetics of peptide association: removal of residual uncleaved MBP-P4*, removal of cleavage fragments from the peptide-binding site, or, alternatively, a direct contribution of DM to peptide association. The DR2 Conformer Created by Peptide Photocleavage Is Short-lived—Mass spectrometry showed that DR2-bound MBP-P4* was cleaved at a rate similar to that of free MBP-P4* (Fig. 2, B and C), and incomplete cleavage could thus not account for the increased rate of peptide association in the presence of DM. Acceleration of peptide association was observed even when photocleavage was extended to 10 min (Fig. 4B). Extension of photocleavage also demonstrated that the peptide-receptive DR2 conformer created by photocleavage was short-lived (Fig. 4A). During UV cleavage, significant quantities of MBP-488 rapidly bound to uncaged DR2 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the reaction kinetics were substantially different when MBP-P4* was photocleaved in the absence of MBP-488. More than 50 min at a more favorable temperature (room temperature) were required to reach 100 mP, a readin"

The identification of an effective intranuclear delivery vehicle and pathway for the transport of therapeutic macromolecules across plasma and nuclear membranes, however, has posed a significant challenge. The anti-DNA antibody fragment 3E10 Fv has received attention as a novel molecular delivery vehicle due to its penetration into living cells with specific nuclear localization, absence of toxicity, and successful delivery of therapeutic cargo proteins in vitro and in vivo. Elucidation of the pathway that allows 3E10 Fv to cross cell membranes is critical to the development of new molecular therapies. Here we show that 3E10 Fv penetrates cells through a nucleoside salvage transporter. 3E10 Fv is unable to penetrate into cells deficient in the equilibrative nucleoside transporter ENT2, and reconstitution of ENT2 into ENT2-deficient cells restores 3E10 Fv transport into cell nuclei. Our results represent the first demonstration of protein transport through a nucleoside salvage pathway. We expect that our finding will facilitate a variety of methods of gene regulation in the treatment of human diseases, open up new avenues of research in nucleoside salvage pathways, and enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases.

The ability to regulate gene expression through intranuclear delivery of macromolecules would significantly impact the treatment of a multitude of human diseases. Effective macromolecular therapy is dependent upon molecular delivery vehicles to circumvent the plasma membrane barrier and facilitate intracellular transport of cargo molecules. The single chain Fv fragment of the 3E10 anti-DNA autoantibody (3E10 Fv) has recently been harnessed as a novel molecular delivery vehicle due to its specific nuclear localization and apparent lack of toxicity (1Weisbart R.H. Stempniak M. Harris S. Zack D.J. Ferreri K. J. Autoimmun. 1998; 11: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 3E10 Fv and Fv fusion proteins readily transduce across cell membranes and penetrate into cell nuclei, and 3E10 Fv has successfully delivered biologically active proteins such as Hsp70 (2Hansen J.E.

Moreover, 3E10 Fv mediated full-length p53 protein therapy in vivo (4Hansen J.E. Fischer L.K. Chan G. Chang S.S. Baldwin S.W. Aragon R.J. Carter J.J. Lilly M. Nishimura R.N. Weisbart R.H. Reeves M.E. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1769-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The pathway that carries 3E10 Fv across cell membranes and into cell nuclei, however, has not been identified. Previous studies implicated DNA binding as important in 3E10 Fv transduction into cell nuclei. Specifically, mutations that abrogate DNA binding by the antibody render it incapable of cellular penetration (5Zack D.J. Stempniak M. Wong A.L. Taylor C. Weisbart R.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2082-2088PubMed Google Scholar). The association between cellular penetration and DNA binding distinguished 3E10 Fv from other protein transduction domains and implied that nucleoside salvage pathways might be involved in 3E10 Fv transport. Both concentrative (CNT) 3The abbreviations used are: CNT, concentrative nucleoside salvage transporter; ENT, equilibrative nucleoside salvage transporter; PKNTD, nucleoside transporter-deficient PK15 cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NBMPR, nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside. and equilibrative (ENT) nucleoside salvage transporters mediate the uptake of nucleobases and nucleosides by mammalian cells (6Kong W. Engel K. Wang J. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 63-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Since any major role of CNTs in 3E10 Fv transport was excluded by previous studies that demonstrated 3E10 Fv penetration into COS-7 cells that lack endogenous CNTs (2Hansen J.E. Sohn W. Kim C.

Cell Lines—COS-7, K562, and CEM/ENT1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). PKNTD/ENT1 and PKNTD/ENT2 cells were generated as described previously (8Ward J.L. Sherali A. Mo Z.P. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8375-8381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Plasmids—A construct for expression of 3E10 Fv in the X-33 strain of Pichia pastoris, pPICZαA-Fv, was generated as described previously (9Weisbart R.H. Miller C.W. Chan G. Wakelin R. Ferreri K. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Lett. 2003; 195: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purification of 3E10 Fv—3E10 Fv was purified from the supernatant of P. pastoris transfected with pPICZαA-Fv as described previously (9Weisbart R.H. Miller C.W. Chan G. Wakelin R. Ferreri K. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Lett. 2003; 195: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cellular Penetration Assays—Purified 3E10 Fv was exchange-dialyzed into PBS prior to application to cells. After dialysis, 10% fetal calf serum was added to the buffer. Control buffer was PBS with 10% fetal calf serum. For adherent cell lines (COS-7, PKNTD/ENT1, and PKNTD/ENT2), 50 μl of control buffer or 3E10 Fv was added to cells on 96-well plates for 1 h. After incubation with 3E10 Fv, the antibody fragment was removed, and cells were washed, fixed in chilled 100% ethanol, and stained with the 9E10 α-Myc antibody as described previously (9Weisbart R.H. Miller C.W. Chan G. Wakelin R. Ferreri K. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Lett. 2003; 195: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For non-adherent cells (K562 and CEM/ENT1), cell pellets composed of ∼200,000 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of control buffer or 10 μM 3E10 Fv and allowed to incubate with intermittent shaking at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then centrifuged at 100 × g for 2 min and washed three times with PBS. Next, cells were spread on glass slides and allowed to dry overnight. Cells were then fixed in chilled 100% ethanol for 10 min, washed three times in PBS, and stained with the 9E10 α-Myc antibody. Nucleoside Transporter Inhibition Assay—Nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside(NBMPR) was purchased from Sigma, and a stock solution of 100 mM NBMPR in Me2SO was prepared. To control for the effects of Me2SO in cell culture, Me2SO was added to control buffers not containing NBMPR. The concentration of Me2SO in all control and experimental buffers was 0.1%. COS-7 cells were pretreated for 30 min with control buffer (PBS + 10% fetal calf serum) or buffer containing 10 or 100 μm NBMPR. Buffers were then replaced with control buffer or 10 μm 3E10 Fv in the presence or absence of 10 or 100 μm NBMPR for 1 h. Cells were then washed, fixed, and stained with the 9E10 α-Myc antibody. Microscopic Images—As described previously, images of cells were acquired with an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope with RC reflected light fluorescent attachment and MagnaFire SP Digital Imaging System (Olympus, Melville, NY) (10Weisbart R.H.

As expected, control K562 (A, left panel) and CEM/ENT1 (B, left panel) cells showed no staining. 3E10 Fv-treated K562 cells exhibited distinct staining (A, right panel), whereas 3E10 Fv-treated CEM/ENT1 cells showed an absence of staining (B, right panel), which indicated a limitation or inability of 3E10 Fv to penetrate into ENT2-deficient cells.

A and B, PK15 cells deficient in nucleoside transporters were reconstituted with ENT1 (PKNTD/ENT1) or ENT2 (PKNTD/ENT2) and were treated with control buffer or 10 μm 3E10 Fv for 1 h. Cells were then washed, fixed, and stained with the α-Myc antibody. Control PKNTD/ENT1 (A, left panel) and PKNTD/ENT2 (B, left panel) cells showed an absence of staining. Similarly, 3E10 Fv-treated PKNTD/ENT1 cells exhibited no staining (A, right panel), indicating failure of the antibody fragment to penetrate into the ENT2-deficient cells. By contrast, 3E10 Fv penetrated well into the PKNTD/ENT2 cells as evidenced by nuclear staining (B, right panel).

Sherali A. Mo Z.P. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8375-8381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We therefore tested NBMPR for inhibition of 3E10 Fv transport. Purified 3E10 Fv (constructed with His6 tag for purification and Myc tag for identification) migrated as a single ∼30-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Transduction of 3E10 Fv into COS-7 cells was confirmed by incubating cells with 10 μm 3E10 Fv for 1 h at 37 °C followed by Western blot analysis of cell lysates (Fig. 1B) or immunocytochemical staining of cells (Fig. 1C, top panels). Western blot analysis of cell lysates demonstrated the presence of an ∼30-kDa Myc-tagged protein inside cells treated with 3E10 Fv (Fig. 1B, lane 2), which indicated penetration of the full-length antibody fragment. Furthermore, immunocytochemical staining confirmed nuclear localization by 3E10 Fv (Fig. 1C, top right panel), consistent with previous confocal microscopy and immunocytochemical studies on the antibody (2Hansen J.E. Sohn W. Kim C. Chang S.S. Huang N.C. Santos D.G. Chan G. Weisbart R.H. Nishimura R.N. Brain Res. 2006; 1088: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Weisbart R.H. Baldwin R. Huh B. Zack D.J. Nishimura R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6020-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Next, COS-7 cells were pretreated for 30 min with control buffer or buffer containing 100 μm NBMPR prior to a 1-h incubation with 10 μm 3E10 Fv in the presence or absence of NBMPR. Subsequent immunocytochemical staining of the cells demonstrated that 100 μm NBMPR suppressed nuclear penetration by 3E10 Fv (Fig. 1C, bottom left panel), which suggested that ENT1 or ENT2 is involved in 3E10 Fv transport. In an attempt to resolve which of the ENTs was linked to 3E10 Fv transport, 3E10 Fv penetration into COS-7 cell nuclei was tested in the presence of a lower dose of NBMPR to take advantage of the different Ki of NBMPR for ENT1 and ENT2 (0.4 nm versus 2.8 μm, respectively) (8Ward J.L. Sherali A. Mo Z.P. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8375-8381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). At 10 μm, NBMPR ENT1 activity is completely inhibited, whereas ENT2 retains moderate activity. In contrast to the distinct inhibition of 3E10 Fv transport provided by 100 μm NBMPR (Fig. 1C, bottom left panel), 3E10 Fv successfully penetrated COS-7 cell nuclei in the presence of 10 μm NBMPR (Fig. 1C, bottom right panel). This result suggested that ENT2, not ENT1, mediated transport of 3E10 Fv. The decreased nuclear staining intensity in cells treated with 3E10 Fv + 10 μm NBMPR when compared with cells treated with 3E10 Fv alone likely reflects partial inhibition of 3E10 Fv transport due to the expected >50% suppression of ENT2 activity by 10 μm NBMPR. As an additional approach to identifying the equilibrative nucleoside transporter(s) involved in 3E10 Fv transduction, we examined 3E10 Fv transduction into the CEM/ENT1 cell line that lacks ENT2 (11Crawford C.R. Patel D.H. Naeve C. Belt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5288-5293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). 10 μm 3E10 Fv was applied to the CEM/ENT1 cells for 1 h. As a positive control, 10 μm 3E10 Fv was also applied to K562 leukemia cells that express both ENT1 and ENT2 (12Huang M. Wang Y. Mitchell B.S. Graves L.M. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2004; 23: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As predicted, immunocytochemical staining of the 3E10 Fv-treated K562 cells demonstrated penetration of the antibody fragment into ∼100% of the cells (Fig. 2A, right panel). CEM/ENT1 cells treated with 3E10 Fv, however, showed no staining (Fig. 2B, right panel). This result demonstrated that the absence of ENT2 significantly impaired transduction by 3E10 Fv into cells. Taken together, the inhibition of 3E10 Fv transport by high concentrations of NBMPR and failure of 3E10 Fv to penetrate a cell line lacking ENT2 strongly support a role of ENT2 in 3E10 Fv transport. To verify that ENT2 facilitates 3E10 Fv intranuclear protein transduction, experiments were performed on nucleoside transporter-deficient PK15 cells (PKNTD) with either ENT1 or ENT2 reconstituted through stable transfection and expression of ENT1 or ENT2 cDNA (8Ward J.L. Sherali A. Mo Z.P. Tse C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8375-8381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). PKNTD/ENT1 cells treated for 1 h with 10 μm 3E10 Fv showed no evidence of nuclear penetration (Fig. 3A, right panel), similar to the results obtained with the CEM/ENT1 cells. By contrast, 3E10 Fv-treated PKNTD/ENT2 cells exhibited distinct nuclear staining (Fig. 3B, right panel), which indicated that restoration of ENT2 to the nucleoside transporter-deficient cells significantly augmented nuclear penetration by 3E10 Fv. This result confirmed that the presence of ENT2 facilitates nuclear penetration by 3E10 Fv and verified protein transduction of the antibody fragment through the ENT2-mediated nucleoside salvage pathway. The nucleoside salvage pathways have been studied in detail, but protein transport through or related to nucleoside salvage has not been previously described. The precise interaction between 3E10 Fv and ENT2 remains to be determined, but it is tempting to speculate that 3E10 Fv may be carried into cells by virtue of its binding to nucleosides or nucleobases that are sub-sequently transported into cells by ENT2. Alternatively, 3E10 Fv may mimic the structure of a nucleoside or nucleobase that is recognized and transported into cells by ENT2. Elucidation of the mechanism by which ENT2 facilitates 3E10 Fv transport should yield further insights into both protein transduction and nucleoside salvage pathways. Furthermore, since ENT2 is located in both plasma and nuclear membranes, it will be important to ascertain whether ENT2 facilitates transport of 3E10 Fv across both cellular and nuclear membranes or whether another pathway is involved in nuclear penetration (13Mani R.S.

With regard to molecular therapy, the linkage between ENT2 and nuclear penetration by 3E10 Fv reported here further establishes 3E10 Fv as a novel molecular delivery vehicle that is distinct from other protein transduction domains previously described. Endosomal localization by cell-penetrating peptides limits their role in molecular therapy (14Jones S.W. Christison R. Bundell K. Voyce C.J. Brockbank S.M. Newham P. Lindsay M.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 145: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 15Kaplan I.M. Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. J. Controlled Release. 2005; 102: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), but the identification of 3E10 Fv transport through ENT2 provides a rationale for future studies on the use of 3E10 Fv in delivering molecules such as small interfering RNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, and transcription factors to cell nuclei. It also generates an impetus to determine whether toxic cell-penetrating antibodies utilize a nucleoside salvage pathway in cellular penetration since inhibition of nucleoside transporters might then be investigated as a means of limiting tissue damage by cytotoxic autoantibodies in certain autoimmune diseases. The discovery of intranuclear protein transduction by 3E10 Fv through the ENT2-mediated nucleoside salvage pathway has profound implications for cell biology, pharmacology, and medicine.

Ikkβ-/- mouse 3T3 fibroblasts have decreased expression of antioxidant genes, such as metallothionein 1 (Mt1). In contrast to wild type and IKKβ-reconstituted Ikkβ-/- cells, IKKβ-null cells display a marked increase in arsenic-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, which leads to activation of the MKK4-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, c-Jun phosphorylation, and apoptosis. Pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and expression of MT1 in the Ikkβ-/- cells prevented JNK activation; moreover, NAC pretreatment, MT1 expression, MKK4 ablation, and JNK inhibition all protected cells from death induced by arsenic. Our data show that two signaling pathways appear to be important for modulating arsenic toxicity. First, the IKK-NF-κB pathway is crucial for maintaining cellular metallothionein-1 levels to counteract ROS accumulation, and second, when this pathway fails, excessive ROS leads to activation of the MKK4-JNK pathway, resulting in apoptosis.

Arsenic is a highly toxic ubiquitous environmental contaminant. Chronic low level exposure may cause skin, lung, bladder, and kidney cancer, whereas higher doses of arsenic lead to tissue damage through the induction of cell death. Such dose and cell type-dependent effects are the basis for arsenic trioxide to be used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Initially it was thought that arsenic, like all-trans-retinoic acid, could target the promyelocytic leukemia gene product retinoic acid receptor (PML-RAR) fusion protein, causing its degradation; however, many PML-RAR-negative cell lines and cells from PML knock-out mice are also sensitive to arsenic, suggesting alternative mechanisms for toxicity (1Akao Y.

Numerous studies have shown that chronic exposure to arsenic from drinking water in humans and experimental animals are often associated with increased oxidative stress, a state when cellular ROS production exceeds antioxidant capacity (19Pi J.

Depending on their level and persistence, excessive ROS can cause diverse pathophysiological conditions, such as oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, that may contribute to cell transformation and tumorigenesis (23Nishigori C.

ROS can perturb the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and disrupt electron transfer, triggering apoptosis and necrosis (18Schuliga M. Chouchane S. Snow E.T. Toxicol.

ROS can also activate death-related signaling effectors, such as the JNK, whose sustained activation results in the phosphorylation of the Bcl family of proteins, leading to cytochrome c release from mitochondria, thereby functioning as an important proapoptotic factor (27Aoki H.

The ultimate toxicity of arsenic, therefore, is dependent largely on the ability of the cell to produce antioxidants and to modulate ROS levels. Tipping the cellular redox balance toward ROS accumulation can enhance arsenic-induced cell damage, as seen in glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit-deficient Gclm-/- fibroblasts and in γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase mutant Caenorhabditis elegans (17Kann S. Estes C. Reichard J.F. Huang M.Y. Sartor M.A. Schwemberger S. Chen Y. Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Xia Y. Puga A. Toxicol. Sci. 2005; 87: 365-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Liao V.H. Yu C.W. Biometals. 2005; 18: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Conversely, inclusion of ROS scavengers in the culture medium protects cell against arsenic toxicity (31Hei T.K.

Hered. 1991; 41: 71-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). One of the most important redox modulation cellular constituents is the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-κB. NF-κB members are present in the cytoplasm associated with IκB, which hinders recognition of the nuclear localization signal on NF-κB and prevents its nuclear translocation. Upon stimulation by various growth factors, cytokines and cellular stressors, the IκB kinase (IKK) complexes consisting of α, β, and γ subunits are activated, which phosphorylate IκB on serine/threonine residues. This phosphorylation leads to IκB ubiquitination and subsequent proteolytic degradation, thereby unmasking the nuclear localization signal on NF-κB and allowing its nuclear translocation. The nuclear NF-κB complex binds to sequence-specific consensus DNA and activates gene transcription (33Edelstein L.C. Lagos L. Simmons M. Tirumalai H. Gelinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2749-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Haas A.F. Wong J.W. Iwahashi C.K. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Davis P.A. Free Radic. Biol.

NF-κB is a critical regulator of the expression of genes involved in adaptive anti-oxidative responses, including glutathione peroxidase, mitochondrial SOD2, and cytosolic SOD1. Cells and mice defective in NF-κB signaling are more susceptible to oxidative damage induced by TNFα, H2O2, and arsenic (36Andela V.B. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Puzas E.J. Rosenblatt J.D. Rosier R.N.

The IKK-NF-κB pathway has recently emerged as a master regulator for buffering cellular redox levels and suppressing ROS accumulation during inflammatory responses (37Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M.

In the current studies we showed that IKKβ activity was essential for transcriptional activation of antioxidant genes, such as metallothionein 1, whose expression was markedly reduced in Ikkβ-/- cells. As a consequence, Ikkβ-/- cells had higher levels of ROS accumulation than wild type cells. Arsenic caused a ROS-dependent activation of the signaling cascade MKK4-JNK-c-Jun that led to apoptosis. The thiol-containing redox scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), MKK4 ablation, SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, and reconstitution of IKKβ and MT1 expression in Ikkβ-/- cells all resulted in a reduction of cell death caused by arsenic exposure. Our data suggest that IKKβ protects cells from arsenic toxicity by supporting antioxidant gene expression, thereby preventing arsenic-induced ROS and activation of the redox-sensitive signaling pathways that lead to apoptosis. Reagents, Antibodies, and cDNA Vectors—All cell culture reagents, including Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium (MEM) fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, MEM nonessential amino acids, penicillin-streptomycin, and MEM vitamins were obtained from Invitrogen.

The p65-/- fibroblasts were from Dr. Sankar Ghosh (Yale University). The AP-1-luciferase MEFs were isolated from E13.5 fetuses of transgenic mice harboring AP-1-driven luciferase gene. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin streptomycin, 1% MEM nonessential amino acids, 1% Eagle’s vitamins. The embryonic stem (ES) cells of wild type, Mkk4-/-, and Mkk7-/- were kindly provided by Dr. Nishina (Tokyo Women’s Medical University, Japan) and were maintained under conditions as described (41Nishina H.

Adenoviruses at 107 plaque-forming units were used for infection of 90% confluent cells. Viral infection was carried out in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 2 h with gentle shaking and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. After infection, the cells were incubated with growth medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. When the cells reached 60-80% confluence, they were exposed to various concentrations of sodium arsenite in fetal bovine serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for different lengths of time. Cell Toxicity Assays—Cells cultured on cover-glass slides were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed, and treated with 0.25% Nonidet P-40 for 1 min. Cells were stained with 10 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 30 min, the staining was observed, and pictures were taken under a fluorescence microscope. Approximately 100-200 cells in 3 different fields/cover-glass were photographed. The percentage of apoptotic cells with condensed or fragmented nuclei was calculated in comparison to the numbers of total cells number. As a measure of total cell death, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was determined in a colorimetric assay following the manufacture’s instructions (Pierce). Briefly, 50 μl of cell culture supernatant were mixed with 200 μl of reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The remaining cells were lysed with water for 30 min and processed as described above. Absorbance was measured in a microplate reader at 490 nm. Total LDH = LDH in supernatant + LDH in water-treated cells. LDH release (%) = (supernatant LDH/total LDH) × 100. Fluorescence based terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed using the labeling protocol provided by the manufacture (Roche Applied Science). ROS Measurement—Direct detection of intracellular steady-state levels of ROS was carried out on living cells using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA). Cells cultured on glass coverslips were incubated with 10 μm CM-H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes, Inc., OR) in fetal bovine serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium in the dark for 30 min. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with DAPI. ROS generation, resulting in the oxidative production of dichlorofluorescein (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 515-540 nm), was detected under fluorescence microscopy. Alternatively, cells cultured on 10-cm2 plates were trypsinized and centrifuged, the cell pellets were incubated in fetal bovine serum-free culture medium with 5 μm H2-DCFDA for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and suspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by FACS-Calibur (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems), which was equipped with a 488 argon laser for measurements of intracellular fluorescence. Logarithmic detectors were used for the FL-1 fluorescence channel necessary for DCF detection. Mean log fluorescence intensity values were obtained by the CELLQUEST software program (BD Biosciences). Cell Lysates and Western Blotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μm leupeptin) at 4 °C for 60 min. Samples were boiled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blotting was performed using antibodies as indicated. Reverse Transcription and Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted by using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Sciences), and RNA (10 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using random hexamer primers and the Stratascript enzyme following the instructions from the company (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed using an MX3000p thermal cycler system and SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The conditions for the amplification were optimized for specific PCR reactions. At the end of the PCR the samples were subjected to melting curve analysis. All reactions were performed at least in triplicate. Oligonucleotides used as the specific primers to amplify mouse antioxidant genes cDNA are as follows: Mt1, 5′-CACGACTTCAACGTCC and 5′-CAGCAGGAGCAGCAGCTCTTCTTGCAG; Mt2, 5′-GCTCCTAGAACTCTTCAAAC and 5′-CAGCAGGAGCAGCAGCTCTTCTTGCAG; Gapdh, 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG and 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC; Sod2, 5′-GCACATTAACGCGCAGATCA and 5′-AGCCTCCAGCAACTCTCCTT; Sod1, 5′-TGGCGATGAAAGCGGTGTGC and 5′-GCGGCTCCCAGCATTTCCAG; glutathione peroxidase, 5′-CCTCAAGTACGTCCGACCTG and 5′-CAATGTCGTTGCGGCACACC; catalase, 5′GCAGATACCTGTGAACTGTC and 5′-GTAGAATGTCCGCACCTGAG. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates at 2 × 105 cells/well the evening before transfection. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid along with 1 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid or with expression vectors for MT1 and green fluorescence protein (GFP) following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated by arsenic and followed by staining by CM-H2DCFDA, anti-p-c-Jun, and DAPI. For the luciferase assay, cells were starved overnight and treated with 20 ng/ml TNFα for 16 h. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity of cell lysates were determined using the luciferase reporter kit and β-galactosidase reporter kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Immunofluorescent Staining for Phospho-c-Jun—Cells grown on cover glasses were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.25% Nonidet P-40. Cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h and incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody diluted 1:500 in 1% BSA followed by rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-G antibody (Molecule Probes) diluted 1:500 in 1% BSA for 30 min. Slides were analyzed using a fluorescent light microscope. Statistical Analysis—Statistical comparisons were performed with Student’s two-tailed paired t test and analysis of variance. Values of p < 0.01 were considered statistically significant. IKKβ Protects Cells from Arsenic Toxicity—The identity of the cells used for these studies was confirmed by genotypic analyses, which detected the presences of the Ikkβ-null alleles (40Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) in Ikkβ-/- and Ikkβ-/--R but not in wild type cells (Fig. 1A). Western blot analyses showed that expression of IKKβ proteins, apparent in wild type, Ikkβ-/--R, and Ikkβ-/--Ad, was completely absent in Ikkβ-/- (Fig. 1B). To evaluate the role of IKKβ in arsenic toxicity, we exposed wild type and IKKβ-deficient cells to different concentrations (0-200 μm) of sodium arsenite for various length of time, as indicated (Fig. 1, C-F). Under normal growth condition, IKK status had not much influence on cell survival; when exposed to sodium arsenite, the Ikkβ-/- cells were more sensitive to toxicity than wild type cells, as indicated by the higher levels of LDH release and apoptosis. There was a clear association of arsenic dose and exposure time with increased death of all cells, but in each treatment condition toxicity was more severe in Ikkβ-/- than in wild type cells. Specifically, although 50 μm arsenite exposure for 6 h did not cause much toxicity of wild type cells, it induced 20% condensed nuclei, indicative of apoptosis, and 80% of the total LDH release, a marker of apoptotic and necrotic death, in the Ikkβ-/- cells. The PARP cleavage and TUNEL staining, measuring caspase activation and genomic DNA damage, respectively, were both markers of apoptosis and were both more highly induced in the arsenic-treated Ikkβ-/- than in wild type cells (Fig. 1, G and H). Importantly, reconstituting IKKβ expression in Ikkβ-/--R and Ikkβ-/--Ad completely protected the Ikkβ-/- cells from arsenic-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1, C, G, and H). The arsenic treatment conditions applied in these studies ranged from low dose (1 μm) and long time (96 h), which might mimic chronic environmental exposure, to high dose (50 μm) and short time (6 h), which might resemble acute accidental/occupational exposure. Nonetheless, in all conditions tested IKK offered equal effective protection against arsenic toxicity. We, therefore, chose the latter treatment condition in most of the subsequent studies. Ikkβ-/- Cells Are Defective in Maintaining Redox Levels after Arsenic Exposure—Arsenic is known to elicit intracellular ROS, which may be the cause of massive death of Ikkβ-/- cells. To test this possibility, wild type, Ikkβ-/-, Ikkβ-/--R, and Ikkβ-/--Ad cells were labeled with CM-H2DCFDA after arsenic exposure, and ROS-activated fluorescence positive cells were identified by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. There was a slight increase in fluorescence levels in all arsenic-exposed cells; however, the intensity was significantly higher in Ikkβ-/- than in wild type, Ikkβ-/--R, and Ikkβ-/--Ad cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, Western blot analyses showed that heme oxygenase-1, whose expression is commonly used as a marker for elevated intracellular ROS, was highly induced by arsenic in Ikkβ-/- but not much so in wild type and Ikkβ-/--R cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Adenoviral-mediated transient IKKβ expression also significantly reduced apoptosis of the Ikkβ-/- cells in response to arsenic (Fig. 2E). To investigate whether ROS were responsible for arsenic toxicity, we used antioxidant agents to modulate cellular redox levels; NAC was used to increase the intracellular concentration of cysteine and up-regulate the level of glutathione, and butylated hydroxytoluene and vitamin E were to prevent or scavenge the formation of reactive oxygen radicals. Wild type and Ikkβ-/- cells were treated with antioxidants before arsenic exposure. Although all antioxidants, specifically vitamin E and NAC, significantly prevented apoptosis of Ikkβ-/- cells, none of the antioxidants seemed to affect wild type cells, which did not have high levels of ROS and apoptosis induced by arsenic. The Ikkβ-/- cells were also extremely sensitive to exogenous H2O2, suggesting that these cells might lack ROS scavengers (Fig. 2E). The Role of IKKβ in ROS Modulation Is Likely Mediated through NF-κB—Lack of ROS scavenging capacity in Ikkβ-/- cells may be due to defective activation of NF-κB, a redox-sensitive transcription factor known to play an important role in antioxidant gene expression. Indeed, TNFα, a known IKK-NF-κB pathway activator, caused an apparent induction of IκBα degradation and NF-κB promoter-driven luciferase activity in wild type but not in Ikkβ-/- cells (Figs. 3, A and B). On the other hand, neither arsenic nor H2O2 induced IκBα degradation in wild type or Ikkβ-/- cells, suggesting that these agents did not cause an apparent activation of NF-κB through immediate induction of the IKKβ-IκBα pathway (Fig. 3B). To determine whether NF-κB has a role in arsenic toxicity, we pretreated wild type cells with a NF-κB inhibitor for 2 h before they were exposed to sodium arsenite. NF-κB inhibitor-treated cells behaved like Ikkβ-/- cells, exhibiting increased ROS accumulation and apoptosis after arsenic exposure (Fig. 3, C and D). Moreover, cells deficient in the p65 (42Shumilla J.A. Broderick R.J. Wang Y. Barchowsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36207-36212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) NF-κB component exhibited an obvious induction of PARP cleavage upon arsenic exposure (Fig. 3E). Thus, there is the existence of an IKKβ-NF-κB"

It is activated by long-chain fatty acids and has been implicated in mediating physiological and pathological effects of long-chain fatty acids on β cells. We mapped the GPR40 transcription start site to a location 1044 bp upstream of the translation start site. This permitted definition of the GPR40 core promoter and the organization of the gene, which comprises a 24-bp non-coding exon, a 698-bp intron and a 4402-bp second exon, containing the entire protein coding sequence. Sequence analysis of the GPR40 locus revealed three evolutionarily conserved regions upstream to the translation start site (HR1-HR3). DNase I-hypersensitive sites were present in the HR2 and HR3 regions in β cells but not in non-β cells. The 5′-flanking region of the GPR40 gene was capable of directing transcriptional activity selectively in β cells. An important component of this is attributable to the HR2 region, which showed strong β cell-specific enhancer activity. Systematic mutagenesis of HR2 revealed several important sub-regions. Mutagenesis of sub-regions 4-5, and 9 reduced transcriptional activity by ∼60 and 40%, respectively. These sub-regions can bind the β cell-specific transcription factors PDX1 and BETA2, respectively, both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, cell-specific expression of the GPR40 gene involves a characteristic chromatin organization of the locus and is controlled at the transcriptional level through HR2, a potent β cell-specific enhancer.

Kaufman K.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 2005; 56: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). LCFAs have complex, divergent effects on β cells: whereas acute exposure leads to enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, prolonged exposure results in impaired β cell function (“lipotoxicity”) (5Poitout V.

Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1297-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this impairment may contribute to the defective β cell function associated with T2DM (7Poitout V. Robertson R.P. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Yet the precise mechanisms linking obesity and T2DM remain incompletely understood. The mouse GPR40 gene is a member of a small gene family encoding G protein-coupled receptors (8Brown A.J. Jupe S. Briscoe C.P. DNA Cell Biol. 2005; 24: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These receptors are activated by fatty acids: GPR40 responds to medium- and long-chain fatty acids (9Itoh Y. Kawamata Y.

The gene family is clustered in a region of ∼40 kb on mouse chromosome 7, downstream to the gene encoding CD22, a receptor involved in modulation of B lymphocyte function (14Poe J.C. Fujimoto Y.

GPR40 is expressed in highly selective manner. In rodents, GPR40 mRNA is present at high levels in pancreatic islets and β cell lines, but at very low levels in all other tissues examined (9Itoh Y. Kawamata Y. Harada M. Kobayashi M. Fujii R. Fukusumi S. Ogi K. Hosoya M. Tanaka Y. Uejima H. Tanaka H. Maruyama M. Satoh R. Okubo S. Kizawa H. Komatsu H. Matsumura F. Noguchi Y. Shinohara T.

In humans, it has been reported that GPR40 is expressed not only in pancreas, but also in brain and monocytes (11Briscoe C.P. Tadayyon M. Andrews J.L. Benson W.G. Chambers J.K. Eilert M.M. Ellis C.

Several studies have examined the role of GPR40 in β cells. In cultured β cells, down-regulation of GPR40 inhibits LCFA-dependent increases in intracellular [Ca2+] and insulin secretion (9Itoh Y. Kawamata Y. Harada M. Kobayashi M. Fujii R. Fukusumi S. Ogi K. Hosoya M. Tanaka Y. Uejima H. Tanaka H. Maruyama M. Satoh R. Okubo S. Kizawa H. Komatsu H. Matsumura F. Noguchi Y. Shinohara T.

Consistent with this, islets isolated from mice lacking GPR40 show impaired insulin secretion in response to short term exposure to LCFAs (15Steneberg P. Rubins N. Bartoov-Shifman R. Walker M.D. Edlund H. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 245-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these mice display significant protection from obesity-induced hyperglycemia and fatty liver (15Steneberg P. Rubins N. Bartoov-Shifman R. Walker M.D. Edlund H. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 245-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar): on the other hand, overexpression of GPR40 in β cells leads to impaired β cell function and diabetes (15Steneberg P. Rubins N. Bartoov-Shifman R. Walker M.D. Edlund H. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 245-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that GPR40 plays a role in mediating both acute and chronic effects of LCFAs on β cells, and may therefore help explain the link between obesity and T2DM. The important physiological role of GPR40 prompted us to study the regulation of the gene. We identified the GPR40 transcription start site (TSS) and showed that the promoter is selectively active in β cells. The GPR40 5′-flanking region contains two highly conserved regions that display DNase I hypersensitivity in β cells: one of these, HR3, contains the GPR40 core promoter, whereas the other, HR2, is a strong transcriptional enhancer that plays an important role in directing GPR40 expression selectively to β cells. Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures using the Tri-Reagent procedure (Molecular Research Center Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where indicated, RNA was treated with DNase I (RQ1, Promega, Madison, WI) to remove traces of genomic DNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of DNase I-treated βTC1 RNA, using reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers used were complementary to a specific sequence located either within the GPR40 coding region or upstream to it. The cDNA was purified and a poly-G tail was added to the cDNA 3′-end using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Promega) by incubating 80% of the cDNA purified above with 1× terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase buffer (Promega), 0.83 mm dGTP and 20 units of enzyme in a final volume of 60 μl at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by heating to 65 °C for 15 min. The cDNA was purified, and PCR was performed using the Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science), with 5 μl of cDNA and 30 pmol of a reverse primer complementary to GPR40 sequences nested to the primers used for reverse transcription and a forward primer: GAATTC(C)24. A fraction of the PCR product was resolved on a 1% agarose gel. When a band appeared, it was excised from the gel, purified, and sequenced. When a smear appeared, the PCR product was purified using the Roche Applied Science purification kit and subcloned into pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega). Plasmids from the resulting bacterial clones were isolated, fractionated on 1% agarose gel, and analyzed by Southern blot, using as a probe, a radioactive end-labeled primer specific for GPR40 and nested to the primer used for PCR. Three of the relevant plasmids were sequenced. A plasmid (pBS-RPA3-T7antisense) was constructed in which a genomic fragment, spanning the GPR40 transcription start site, was inserted antisense to the T7 promoter and sense to the T3 promoter. The insert contained 133 bp of the GPR40 second exon, the entire first exon (24 bp), and 52 bp upstream to the transcription start site. In vitro transcription reaction was carried out as described (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1988; (, Greene/Wiley-Interscience, New York)Google Scholar). The resulting radioactive probe was 278 bases, of which 209 bases are derived from the GPR40 genomic sequence. RPAs were performed using 50 μg of βTC1 (21Efrat S. Linde S. Kofod H. Spector D.

Samples were resolved on polyacrylamide urea gels and visualized by autoradiography. The following established cell lines were used in this study: βTC1 (mouse β cells) (21Efrat S. Linde S. Kofod H.

Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), CHO (Chinese hamster ovary cells), 293T (human embryonic kidney cells), and NIH-3T3 (mouse fibroblast cells). βTC1, HIT, CHO, NIH-3T3, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (or 15% horse serum, 2.5% fetal calf serum for βTC1 cells), penicillin (200 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). A DNA fragment spanning the GPR40 gene was isolated from a mouse genomic library using a 32P-labeled probe containing the 900-bp GPR40 open reading frame. The clone obtained is 16,195 bp long, begins in the tenth intron of the CD22 gene, contains the entire GPR40 gene, and ends 3 kb downstream to the GPR41 open reading frame. The DNA fragment was characterized by restriction enzyme analysis and partial sequencing. Transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique (25Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). CHO and HIT transfections consisted of a mixture of 2 μg of reporter construct and 250 ng internal control plasmid. When expression plasmids were used, 1-2 μg of each was added. The total amount of expression plasmid DNA was equalized by addition of the empty expression plasmid pcDNA3. Transfection of 293T cells utilized 4 μg of expression plasmid and 0.5 μg of plasmid pCMV-GFP. Total DNA amount was adjusted to 10 μg by addition of pUC18 DNA. Glycerol shock was applied to HIT cells (20% glycerol) and CHO cells (10% glycerol) 4-7 h after transfection. Cells were harvested 40-48 h after transfection, and whole cell extracts were prepared as described below. Whole Cell Extracts—Cells were washed with PBS, collected, and pelleted by centrifugation for 30 s in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in KPi buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and extracted by 3 cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature. Cell debris was removed by 5 min centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Nuclear Extracts—Cells were washed with PBS and collected by centrifugation for 30 s in a microcentrifuge. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (26Aronheim A. Ohlsson H. Park C.W. Edlund T. Walker M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3893-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of cell extracts was determined by the Bradford method (27Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211840) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase assays were carried out as follows: whole cell extracts containing 5-50 μg (1-5 μl) of protein were added to 100 μl of either firefly luciferase assay buffer (20 mm Tricine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.07 mm (MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2*5H2O, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 3.3 mm dithiothreitol, 270 μm coenzyme A, 470 μm luciferin (Promega #E1602), and 530 μm ATP, pH 7.8) or Renilla luciferase assay buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.5 μm coelenterazine (Calbiochem)). The light output was determined over a 10-s interval using a LUMAC Biocounter M2500 luminometer. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized according to the activity of Renilla luciferase. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange system (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligonucleotides designed for mutagenesis of the HR2 region of GPR40 are indicated in the supplemental information. Sequence alignment of genomic DNA sequences was performed using NCBI-BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) and software from GCG. Identification of transcription factor binding sites was performed using rVista program and Geno-matix suite programs MatInspector and FrameWorker. Probe Labeling—The double-stranded oligonucleotides from the HR2 region of the mouse GPR40 promoter, which were used as probes are described in the supplemental materials. Radioactive probes were generated as described (28Glick E. Leshkowitz D. Walker M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2199-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Specific activity obtained was typically ∼2,000 cpm/fmol. Binding Reaction—Nuclear extracts of βTC1, NIH-3T3, 293T, and transfected 293T cells were prepared as described above. Binding reactions and electrophoresis conditions used for PDX1 were as follows: protein extracts (0.5-2.5 μg) were incubated for 10 min on ice in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 70 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) with addition of 900 ng of poly(dI·dC) (Sigma) in a final assay volume of 14 μl, in the presence or absence of antibody, as specified in the figure legends. Competition experiments included 10-, 50-, 100-, or 200-fold molar excesses of the following three unlabeled oligonucleotides: HR2-2-6, HR2-M4-5, and the E1 element from the rat insulin gene promoter (29German M. Ashcroft S. Docherty K. Edlund T. Edlund H. Goodison S. Imura H. Kennedy G. Madsen O. Melloul D. Moss L. Olson K. Permutt A. Philippe J. Robertson R.P. Rutter W.J. Serup P. Stein R. Steiner D. Tsai M-J. Walker M.D. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1002-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Following this incubation, 1 μl of 32P-labeled probe was added (∼25 fmol), and incubation was allowed to continue on ice for an additional 20 min. Samples were subsequently resolved on 5.5% polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA at 184 V for 80 min at 4 °C. Reactions to test BETA2 binding were carried out in the presence or absence of appropriate antibodies as described (28Glick E. Leshkowitz D. Walker M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2199-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Competition experiments included 10-, 50-, or 100-fold molar excesses of unlabeled oligonucleotide (HR2-7-10, HR2-EM, and P1 (from the rat insulin promoter (30Liberzon A. Ridner G. Walker M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). HR2-EM contains two point mutations (underlined) in the E-box element: 5′-CCTGTTCCCAAGCCTGGCTGCTGATATAAAGCTAC-3′. Following electrophoresis (28Glick E. Leshkowitz D. Walker M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2199-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), gels were dried, and labeled DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by using a PhosphorImager and ImageGauge software. Preparation of Nuclei—Cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in growth medium. They were pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5 min, washed twice in cold PBS, and incubated on ice for 10 min in Dounce buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40). Cells were then homogenized on ice using a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes, pestle B (loose)), and nuclei were pelleted at 1000 rpm for 7 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were then resuspended in cold RSB buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2), counted in a hemocytometer, pelleted again, and resuspended in 1× RQ1 DNase buffer at concentration of 108 nuclei/ml. DNase I Treatment—A series of digestions using DNase I (RQ1) was performed in the presence of 107 nuclei and increasing concentrations of DNase (0-20 units/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of 1 volume of 2× TNESK (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and 200 μg/ml proteinase K). Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C and then phenol-chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8). The concentration of purified genomic DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Southern Blot—Purified DNase I-treated genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested to completion at 37 °C overnight with KpnI and resolved on 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA) at 20 V overnight. Southern blot analysis was performed as described (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1988; (, Greene/Wiley-Interscience, New York)Google Scholar). Soluble chromatin was prepared as described (31Ainbinder E. Revach M. Wolstein O. Moshonov S. Diamant N. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6354-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) from 2 × 107 βTC1 cells. For each immunoprecipitation reaction, 25 μg of pre-cleared chromatin was incubated with anti-PDX1 or anti-BETA2 or control antiserum overnight at 4 °C on a rotator wheel. Following centrifugation, the extracts were incubated with 20-30 μl of 50% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose suspension at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotator wheel, and the beads were then washed. The immune complexes were then eluted by incubating the beads three times with 100 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, 20 μg/ml glycogen) for 10 min each. The combined eluates were heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the formaldehyde cross-links. The eluates were extracted once with phenolchloroform and once with chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 20 μl of TE buffer. A 2-μl sample was used for amplification by quantitative real-time PCR. The real-time PCR reactions were performed in an ABI 7300 real-time PCR system using the “absolute quantification method” option with SYBR-Green PCR master Mix (ABI) and 333 nm primers. The primers used are described in the supplemental materials. In each experiment, a standard curve for each chromatin was plotted using serial dilutions of chromatin input. The PCR program employed 40 cycles of denaturation (95 °C for 10 s), annealing, elongation, and fluorescence detection (60 °C for 1 min). At the end of the final cycle, a dissociation curve of all samples was performed. The DNA recovered from each immunoprecipitate was calculated as a percentage of the total input chromatin. Statistical significance between two groups was assessed using unpaired two-tailed t test. The data in Fig. 5 was analyzed by two-factor analysis of variance using experiment and mutant as the factors. Means for each mutant were compared with wild-type mean using the Dunnett test (α = 0.05). The data in Fig. 6C was analyzed using the Wilcoxon two-sample test corrected for multiple comparisons by the Holms method. Values are shown as mean ± S.E.FIGURE 6PDX1 binds the HR2 region of the GPR40 flank in vitro and in vivo. A, EMSA analysis. Nuclear extracts from untransfected 293T cells (lane 1), 293T transfected with PDX1 expression vector (lane 2), NIH-3T3 (lane 3), or βTC1 (lanes 4-8) were incubated with 32P-labeled HR2-2-6 probe and resolved on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. In lanes 5-8 the incubation reaction was performed in the presence of the following: PBS (lane 5), anti-PDX1 antibodies (lane 6), pre-immune serum anti-P33 (lane 7), and irrelevant anti-serum anti-N22 (lane 8). B, competition experiments were performed by incubation of nuclear extracts from βTC1 cells with 32P-labeled HR2-2-6 probe, and increasing concentrations of unlabeled E1, HR2-2-6, or HR2-M4-5 oligonucleotides. Extent of binding is expressed relative to that observed in the absence of unlabeled oligonucleotides. C, ChIP. Cross-linked chromatin from βTC1 cells was immunoprecipitated using either anti-PDX1 antibodies or pre-immune serum. DNA fragments recovered from immunoprecipitations were amplified using specific sets of primers corresponding to the β cell-specific enhancer HR2, and the coding sequence (CDS) of GPR40 and CD22 genes. Binding of antisera to the tested regions was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and presented as percentage recovery of input chromatin. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three or more independent ChIP experiments. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (p < 0.04 for anti-PDX1 compared with GPR40 CDS, p < 0.02 for anti-PDX1 compared with CD22 CDS, and p = 0.05 for anti-PDX1/HR2 compared with pre-immune/HR2). Statistical significance involving more than two groups in the experiment was determined by comparing the occupancy of PDX1 on HR2 region to each of the other regions using the Wilcoxon 2-sample test corrected for multiple comparisons by the Holms method.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Characterization of the GPR40 Transcription Start Site and Intron-Exon Organization—As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling cell-specific regulation of the mouse GPR40 gene, we identified the 5′-end of the GPR40 mRNA. 5′-RACE experiments using βTC1 RNA and primers complementary to the open reading frame of GPR40 (Fig. 1A) produced a major product of ∼400 bp (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Comparison of its sequence with that of mouse genomic DNA revealed the presence of a 698-bp intron beginning 321 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon, and a 24-bp first exon. Thus, the major TSS is located 1044 bp upstream of the translation initiation site. Additional weaker bands, suggested the existence of minor upstream transcription start sites (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Indeed, a 5′-RACE experiment performed with a primer starting 4 bases downstream to the major transcription start site gave rise to several products: sequencing of three of these showed distinct 5′-ends mapping 100-150 bp upstream of the major transcription start site (data not shown). To confirm this result, RPAs were performed using a 278-base RNA probe comprising sequences corresponding to the 52 bp immediately upstream of the putative transcription start site, the 24 bp of exon 1 and the 133 bp at the 5′-end of exon 2 (Fig. 1C). A protected band of ∼157 bases was observed using βTC1 RNA, but not αTC1 RNA (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2), confirming the location of the start site indicated by the 5′-RACE result. An additional weak full protection band (209 bases) was also seen, consistent with the existence of the additional minor transcription start sites previously indicated by 5′-RACE. Additional 5′-RACE experiments performed using primers distributed across the GPR40 gene (data not shown), and examination of expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences present in public data-bases, suggest that no"

https://openalex.org/W2092188551,"Laeverin/aminopeptidase Q (APQ) is a cell surface protein specifically expressed on human embryo-derived extravillous trophoblasts that invades the uterus during placentation. The cDNA cloning of Laeverin/APQ revealed that the sequence encodes a protein with 990 amino acid residues, and Laeverin/APQ contains the HEXXHX(18)E gluzincin motif, which is characteristic of the M1 family of aminopeptidases, although the exopeptidase motif of the family, GAMEN, is uniquely substituted for the HAMEN sequence. In this study, we expressed a recombinant human Laeverin/APQ using a baculovirus expression system, purified to homogeneity, and characterized its enzymatic properties. It was found that Laeverin/APQ had a broad substrate specificity toward synthetic substrate, although it showed a preference for Leu-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide. Searching natural substrates, we found that Laeverin/APQ was able to cleave the N-terminal amino acid of several peptides such as angiotensin III, kisspeptin-10, and endokinin C, which are abundantly expressed in the placenta. In contrast to the case with other M1 aminopeptidases, bestatin inhibited the aminopeptidase activity of Laeverin/APQ much more effectively than other known aminopeptidase inhibitors. These results indicate that Laeverin/APQ is a novel bestatin-sensitive leucine aminopeptidase and suggest that the enzyme plays important roles in human placentation by regulating biological activity of key peptides at the embryo-maternal interface."

We expressed fragments of ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) in COS cells alone or fused to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), each tagged with yellow fluorescent protein, and used confocal imaging and glycoprotein analysis to identify the determinants of ER targeting and retention. Single transmembrane domains (TMD) of RyR1 taken from the first (TMD1–TMD2) or last (TMD5–TMD6) pair were expressed in the ER membrane. TMD3–TMD4 was expressed in the outer mitochondrial membrane. The TMD outer pairs (TMD1–TMD2 and TMD5–TMD6) retained ICAM-1, a plasma membrane-targeted protein, within the ER membrane. TMD1 alone provided a strong ER retention signal and TMD6 a weaker signal, but the other single TMD were unable to retain ICAM-1 in the ER. We conclude that TMD1 provides the first and sufficient signal for ER targeting of RyR1. The TMD outer pairs include redundant ER retention signals, with TMD1 providing the strongest signal.

Ryanodine receptors (RyR) 3The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor(s); IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor(s); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TMD, transmembrane domain(s); ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein. compose a family of intracellular Ca2+ channels that mediate release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores of excitable and non-excitable cells (1Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The three mammalian subtypes of RyR (types 1–3) share ∼70% amino acid sequence identity, and they are also related to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) (1Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 2Mignery G.A. Suödhof T.C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Nature. 1989; 342: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). All subtypes of each of the major families of intracellular Ca2+ channels are expressed predominantly, although not exclusively, in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or sarcoplasmic reticulum (3Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 4Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T-U. Dubel S.J Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Both families of channels are regulated by diverse intracellular signals, and they also share structural features. All IP3R are co-regulated by Ca2+ and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (5Taylor C.W. Laude A.J. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and they are modulated by many additional signals (6Patterson R.L. Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 437-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). RyR are also regulated by cytosolic Ca2+ and modulated by many of the signals that regulate IP3R (1Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), but RyR subtypes differ in their most important modes of physiological regulation. RyR1, the major isoform of skeletal muscle, is activated by depolarization of the sarcolemma transmitted from dihydropyridine receptors in the plasma membrane to RyR in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (7Papadopoulos V. Leuranguer V. Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44046-44056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle, the major activator of RyR2 is the local increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] that follows depolarizationevoked activation of dihydropyridine receptors. In other cells in which each of the three RyR subtypes can be expressed (8Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), cytosolic Ca2+ and such signals as cyclic ADP-ribose (9Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP: Structures, Metabolism and Functions. 2002; (, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA)Crossref Google Scholar) are probably the major regulators of RyR. Both IP3R and RyR form homo- or heterotetrameric assemblies of subunits (3Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10Xiao B. Masumiya H. Jiang D. Wang R. Yoshitatsu S. Zhang L. Murayama T. Ogawa Y. Lai F.A. Wagenknecht T. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41778-41785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Each subunit contains a large cytosolic N-terminal domain, a short C-terminal tail, and a stretch of hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMD), the last two of which form a cation-selective pore with the intervening luminal loop (11Ramos-Franco J. Galvan D. Mignery G.A. Fill M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Balshaw D. Gao L. Meissner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The biophysical properties and probably the structure of the pore are similar for RyR and IP3R (14Williams A.J. West D.J. Sitsapesan R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 61-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and a structure similar to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-binding core is present within a similar part of RyR1 (15Serysheva I.I. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Ludtke S.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 345: 427-431Google Scholar). Considerable evidence suggests that each IP3R subunit has six TMD (16Galvan D.L. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J.

Biophys. 2004; 40: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Dulhunty A.F. Pouliquin P. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2003; 30: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is clear that the N and C termini are cytosolic (20Du G.G. Sandu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), that the only TMD lie toward the C terminus, and that all models share four TMD, but there have been competing claims for 4–12 TMD (20Du G.G.

The position of the final pair of TMD and the role of the intervening loop in forming a selectivity filter are clear (see Fig. 1A) (13Samso M. Wagenknecht T. Allen P.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 6: 539-544Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Dulhunty A.F. Pouliquin P. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2003; 30: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Du G.G. Guo X. Khanna V.K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31760-31771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This region is most conserved within RyR and IP3R (see Fig. 1B), and point mutations within the loop affect the conductance of the channel (4Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T-U. Dubel S.J Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 24Du G.G. Guo X. Khanna V.K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

J. 2001; 79: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Analysis of membrane insertion of RyR1 fragments defined the boundaries of the six TMD shown in Fig. 1A, but suggested also the existence of another membrane-associated region (residues 4329–4381; “M4a–M4b” in Ref. 20Du G.G. Sandu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) before the TMD1 shown in Fig. 1A. Substantial additional attempts to resolve the topology of this region (26Du G.G. Avila G. Sharma P. Khanna V.K. Dirksen R.T. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37566-37574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) failed to demonstrate the presence of a pair of TMD before TMD1, suggesting that the region may be associated with the membrane without integrating into it. The latter is consistent also with three-dimensional reconstructions of cryoelectron micro-scopic images of RyR1. These show that the transmembrane stalk includes at least five α-helices from each of the four subunits and that it is large enough to accommodate at least six TMD from each (15Serysheva I.I. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Ludtke S.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 345: 427-431Google Scholar, 27Ludtke S.J. Serysheva I.I. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1203-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The most recent high resolution structure of the pore region of RyR1 suggests also that the M4a–M4b region may lie along the cytosolic membrane surface rather than forming TMD (27Ludtke S.J. Serysheva I.I. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1203-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest that RyR, like IP3R, have six TMD (see Fig. 1A). In our analysis, we assumed that RyR1 has six TMD (see Fig. 1A). The boundaries of the shared TMD are the same as those proposed by Bhat and Ma (28Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8597-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in their four-TMD model, with their TMD1–TMD2 equating with ours, but their TMD3–TMD4 equating with our TMD5–TMD6 (see Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Most cells express IP3R; many express RyR; and many express both, although tissues differ considerably in their complements of IP3R and RyR subtypes. The patterns of expression change also during development. Although most IP3R and RyR in most cells are expressed in the ER or sarcoplasmic reticulum, the two channels may be segregated within those organelles (29Lee H.C. Sci. STKE. 2000; 2000: PE1Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and they may also be expressed in the nucleoplasm (30Echevarria W. Leite M.F. Guerra M.T. Zipfel W.R. Nathanson M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 31Marius P. Guerra M.T. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Leite M.F. Cell Calcium. 2006; 39: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), secretory vesicles (32Huh Y.H. Yoo J.A. Bahk S.J. Yoo S.H. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2507-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and plasma membrane (4Dellis O. Dedos S. Tovey S.C. Rahman T-U. Dubel S.J Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 33Moonga B.S. Li S. Iqbal J. Davidson R. Shankar V.S. Bevis P.J.R. Inzerillo A. Abe E. Huang L.-H.C Zaidi M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282 (–F932): F921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such specific subcellular targeting of intracellular Ca2+ channels is an important determinant of the spatial organization of intracellular Ca2+ signals, but the mechanisms are not understood (34Parker A.K.T. Gergely F.V. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ER-resident membrane proteins must first be targeted to the ER, usually by the signal recognition particle, which recognizes a stretch of 7–15 hydrophobic residues as they emerge from the ribosome (35Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The signal recognition particle then delivers the nascent protein-ribosome complex to the Sec61 translocon, allowing co-translational insertion of the protein into the ER membrane (36High S. Abell B.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Once targeted to the ER, resident proteins must be retained by preventing them from leaving or by active retrieval from the Golgi (37Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Protein Targeting, Transport & Translocation. 2002; (, Academic Press, Orlando, FL)Google Scholar). Both cytosolic (di-Arg- or C-terminal di-Lys- or Tyr-based motifs) and TMD sequences can mediate retention or retrieval of ER membrane proteins (discussed in Ref. 34Parker A.K.T. Gergely F.V. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RyR1 lacks C-terminal di-Lys motifs, and the N-terminal di-Arg motifs are unlikely to be effective. For both IP3R and RyR, TMD provide the major signals for ER retention (28Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8597-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Parker A.K.T. Gergely F.V. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Sayers L.G. Miyawaki A. Muto A. Takeshita H. Yamamoto A. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our previous analysis of IP3R1 established that ER retention signals are provided by any pair of TMD together with the linking luminal loop or by TMD5 or TMD6 alone, although the single TMD provide weaker retention signals than do the pairs (34Parker A.K.T. Gergely F.V. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A similar analysis of RyR1 concluded that only TMD6 includes an ER retention signal: TMD1–TMD2 and TMD5 were suggested to be ineffective (28Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8597-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The signals that target RyR1 or IP3R1 to the ER are less clear, although they, too, involve the TMD. A naturally occurring N-terminally truncated RyR1 comprising only its last 656 residues and therefore including TMD1–TMD6 is targeted to and retained within the ER (39Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Nishi M. Ikeda M. Sugimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A similar fragment of RyR2 is also targeted to the ER (40George C.H. Jundi H. Thomas N.L. Scoote M. Walters N. Williams A.J. Lai F.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2627-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For IP3R, the first pair of TMD is required for ER targeting, but either TMD when expressed alone is targeted to mitochondria (34Parker A.K.T. Gergely F.V. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Expression of fragments of IP3R or RyR in the ER requires that they are both targeted to the ER and then retained within it: such fragments must therefore include both targeting and retention signals. ER retention signals can be identified in proteins that lack ER-targeting signals by constructing chimeric proteins with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a plasma membrane protein with a single TMD that has its own ER-targeting sequence (28Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8597-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we used fragments of RyR1 and the same fragments attached to ICAM-1 to address the mechanisms responsible for ER targeting and retention of RyR1. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium with 5.6 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 2 mml-glutamine. They were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (34Parker A.K.T. Gergely F.V. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Preparation of Expression Constructs—Full-length rabbit RyR1 (GenBank™ accession number X15209) (21Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) N-terminally tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was used to examine subcellular targeting of full-length RyR1. This construct was a gift from Dr. David MacLennan (University of Toronto) (20Du G.G. Sandu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PCR was used to isolate fragments of RyR1 from the same construct using the primers listed in supplemental Table S1. Fragments of the RyR1 sequence were subcloned in-frame into the pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech) to allow expression of RyR1 fragments N-terminally tagged with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) (see Fig. 1C). EYFP-ICAM and EYFP-tagged chimeras of ICAM-1 with fragments of RyR1 (Fig. 1C) were produced by PCR amplification of the RyR1 fragment from the pEYFP-C1 clones using the EYFP-ICAM primers (supplemental Table S1) and ligated into the pBJ1Neo vector containing ICAM-1 (a gift from Dr. Mark Davis, Stanford University) (41Wulfing C. Sjaastad M.D. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6302-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The coding sequences of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing (supplemental Table S2), which also confirmed several minor nucleotide differences from the published RyR1 sequence (20Du G.G. Sandu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The expression construct for full-length OIP106 (O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase-interacting protein 106) N-terminally tagged with c-Myc was provided by Dr. Anne Stephenson (School of Pharmacy, London) (42Brickley K. Smith M.J. Beck M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14723-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Immunostaining and Confocal Imaging—Nearly confluent COS-7 cells grown on glass coverslips and transfected with appropriate vectors were used 20 h after transfection. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The following antibodies (in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% bovine serum albumin) were used: rabbit anti-calreticulin antiserum (1:100; Calbiochem), anti-GM130 monoclonal antibody (1:100; BD Transduction Laboratories), and anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology) with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse Alexa 633- or Alexa 488-coupled secondary antibodies (1:500; Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted in either ProLong (Invitrogen) or 85% glycerol with 2.5% n-propyl gallate and stored at –20 °C. Mitochondria were identified using MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) as reported previously (34Parker A.K.T. Gergely F.V. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Confocal imaging was performed using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 or a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS scanning confocal microscope with settings that avoided bleed-through between pairs of indicators. Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop and adjusted to use the full range of pixel intensities. The images shown are typical of many fields from at least three independent transfections (see legend to Fig. 2). Western Blotting and Deglycosylation—Membranes and supernatant fractions were prepared by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 30 min) from transfected cells. The fractions were either prepared for Western blotting or incubated with 0.1 unit/ml endoglycosidase H or 10 units/ml N-glycosidase F (both from Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 4 h exactly as described previously (34Parker A.K.T. Gergely F.V. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, EYFP- or EGFP-tagged proteins were identified using rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibodies (1:1000; AbCam) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antiserum (1:5000; AbCam) and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Perbio) to visualize antibody binding. Western blotting was performed using the iBlot dry gel transfer system (Invitrogen), and the blots were quantified using GeneTools software (Syngene). Expression of Full-length RyR1 in the ER—When expressed alone, GFP was diffusively distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of COS-7 cells and co-localized with neither calreticulin (Fig. 2A) nor cyan fluorescent protein-ER (cyan fluorescent protein tagged with the signal sequence from calreticulin at its N terminus and KDEL at its C terminus) (data not shown). Treatment of GFP-transfected cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 37 °C released fluorescence from 97% of the cells (Fig. 3E), and after crude subcellular fractionation, most of the GFP was found in the supernatant (Fig. 2D). These and previous results (20Du G.G. Sandu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Bhat M.B. Ma J.

Full-length RyR1 N-terminally tagged with EGFP was localized to the ER. The receptors were located within fine reticular networks, which were most abundant around the nucleus; colocalized with calreticulin and calnexin (Fig. 2, B and C); and were associated with the membrane fraction (Fig. 2D). We reported previously an indistinguishable distribution for IP3R1 in COS-7 cells (34Parker A.K.T. Gergely F.V. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and others have reported expression of complete (20Du G.G. Sandu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8597-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) N- or C-terminally tagged GFP-RyR1 in the ER of various cell types. The TMD Region of RyR1 Is Expressed in the ER—COS-7 cells do not express endogenous RyR (44Chen S.R.W. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. Mac-Lennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This allows heterologous expression of RyR1 fragments to be used to identify determinants of ER expression with no risk that fragments might be retained within the ER by forming oligomers with native RyR. A fragment of RyR1 that includes the six TMD but excludes the N-terminal region (RyTMD1–6C) (Fig. 1C) was expressed in the ER, co-localized with calreticulin (Fig. 3A) and calnexin (data not shown), and was retained in cells after permeabilization (Fig. 3E). Identical results were obtained after removal of the C-terminal tail from this fragment (RyTMD1–6) (Fig. 3, B and E). Expression of similar fragments of IP3R1 caused significant changes in cellular morphology that were prevented by introducing an inactivating mutation within the pore (34Parker A.K.T. Gergely F.V. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We had anticipated similar problems with RyR1, but the morphology of cells expressing RyTMD1–6C, RyTMD1–6, or RyTMD5–6 was normal (Figs. 3 and 4C), although the levels of expression of these fragments were much lower than for similar fragments of IP3R1. Others have also reported low levels of heterologous expression of RyR1 (44Chen S.R.W. Vaughan D.M. Airey J.A. Coronado R. Mac-Lennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Previous work showed that removal of either much of the N-terminal (28Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8597-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Nishi M. Ikeda M. Sugimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or most of the C-terminal tail (28Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8597-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) of RyR1 failed to affect ER targeting and retention. Our results extend these observations and confirm that the region of RyR1 that includes its six TMD is sufficient both to target it to the ER and to retain it there. We have not examined whether additional redundant ER localization signals are present within either of the cytosolic regions, and we cannot exclude expression of some RyR1 in the Golgi (see below), but it is clear that neither RyR1 nor RyTMD1–6 is significantly co-localized with GM130 (Fig. 3, C and D), a marker of the early Golgi (45Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). We conclude that the TMD region of RyR1 lying between residues 4551 and 4943 is sufficient to mediate both targeting to and retention within the ER. The First and Last Pairs of TMD from RyR1 Are Expressed in the ER—The first (RyTMD1–2) and final (RyTMD5–6) pairs of TMD were expressed in the ER. They were distributed in a fine reticular network and co-localized with calreticulin (Fig. 4, A and C) and cyan fluorescent protein-ER (data not shown); and after subcellular fractionation, both fragments were found in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4D). The subcellular distribution of the middle pair of TMD (RyTMD3–4) was entirely different: it was associated with membranes after cell fractionation (Fig. 4D), but it was not within the ER (Fig. 4B). RyTMD3–4 was instead associated with mitochondrial membranes, forming a ring around each area of staining with MitoTracker Red, a mitochondrial matrix marker (Fig. 5A). The annular distribution of RyTMD3–4 around the Mito-Tracker Red staining (Fig. 5A) left open the possibility that this fragment might have been targeted to ER associated specifically with mitochondria. To address this possibility, we coexpressed RyTMD3–4 with Myc-tagged OIP106 (42Brickley K. Smith M.J. Beck M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14723-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The latter associates with kinesin and causes mitochondria to aggregate (42Brickley K. Smith M.J. Beck M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14723-14732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In COS cells, too, expression of OIP106 caused the mitochondria to aggregate (Fig. 5, B, C, and E), and RyTMD3–4 co-localized with these aggregates (Fig. 5B). By contrast, the distribution of RyTMD1–2, which is targeted to the ER (Fig. 4A), was unaffected by coexpression of OIP106 (Fig. 5, D and E). Furthermore, whereas OIP106 and RyTMD3–4 were perfectly colocalized (Fig. 5B, inset), both formed annuli around the Mito-Tracker Red staining (Fig. 5, A and C, insets). These results confirm that RyTMD3–4 is expressed within the outer mitochondrial membrane and so lacks ER-targeting sequences. Furthermore, expression of RyTMD3–4 within an intracellular membrane (Figs. 4 and 5) is consistent with this region (residues 4770–4830) including two TMD, an even number to allow the N and C termini of the receptor to be cytosolic (20Du G.G.

https://openalex.org/W1988873620,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) expression is controlled at the transcriptional level through three TaxBLV-responsive elements (TxREs) responsive to the viral transactivator TaxBLV. The cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) has been shown to interact with CRE-like sequences present in the middle of each of these TxREs and to play critical transcriptional roles in both basal and TaxBLV-transactivated BLV promoter activity. In this study, we have investigated the potential involvement of the cAMP-response element modulator (CREM) in BLV transcriptional regulation, and we have demonstrated that CREM proteins were expressed in BLV-infected cells and bound to the three BLV TxREs in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using BLV-infected cell lines demonstrated in the context of chromatin that CREM proteins were recruited to the BLV promoter TxRE region in vivo. Functional studies, in the absence of TaxBLV, indicated that ectopic CREMτ protein had a CRE-dependent stimulatory effect on BLV promoter transcriptional activity. Cross-link of the B-cell receptor potentiated CREMτ transactivation of the viral promoter. Further experiments supported the notion that this potentiation involved CREMτ Ser-117 phosphorylation and recruitment of CBP/p300 to the BLV promoter. Although CREB and TaxBLV synergistically transactivated the BLV promoter, CREMτ repressed this TaxBLV/CREB synergism, suggesting that a modulation of the level of TaxBLV transactivation through opposite actions of CREB and CREMτ could facilitate immune escape and allow tumor development.

These features are thought to be due to the transcriptional repression of viral expression in vivo (1Gupta P. Ferrer J.F.

The 5′-LTR is composed of the U3, R, and U5 regions and transcription initiates at the U3-R junction. BLV exhibits two distinct functional transcriptional states as follows: a low basal level of transcription ensured by host cellular transcription factors, and a high level of transcription directed by the virus-encoded transcriptional activator TaxBLV (3Derse D. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2462-2471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Willems L. Gegonne A. Chen G. Burny A. Kettmann R. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3385-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the early stages of BLV transcription, before TaxBLV expression and transactivation, the basal transcriptional promoter activity is ensured by several cis-acting elements located in the 5′-LTR. In the U3 region are present the promoter CAAT and TATA boxes (5Derse D. Casey J.W. Science. 1986; 231: 1437-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Katoh I. Yoshinaka Y. Ikawa Y. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and three 21-bp enhancers, each containing an imperfectly conserved 8-bp cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE), which binds at least three proteins: CRE-binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factors 1 and 2 (ATF-1 and ATF-2) (7Adam E.

Importantly, the 21-bp enhancers are also called TaxBLV-responsive elements (TxREs) because transactivation of the BLV LTR by TaxBLV requires these enhancers. It has been proposed that TaxBLV activation of transcription could be mediated, as reported for human T-cell leukemia virus-1, through increased binding of the cellular proteins CREB, ATF-1, and ATF-2 (and possibly other factors yet to be identified) to the TxREs (7Adam E.

Virol. 1992; 66: 766-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the CREB/CREM/ATF family of transcription factors, the cAMP-response element modulator (CREM) has emerged as a unique member because CREM expression is finely regulated, both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, leading to the production of various activator and repressor isoforms (13Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 14Sassone-Corsi P. Int. J. Biochem.

In contrast to CREB and ATF, the CREM isoforms are expressed in a cell- and tissue-specific manner (13Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P.

A. 1994; 91: 12423-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Production of the different CREM isoforms depends upon RNA processing and upon selection of transcription initiation sites or translation initiation sites. CREM isoforms are highly homologous to CREB, especially in their DNA-binding domain and kinase-inducible domain (KID). However, with the exception of CREMτ, CREMθ1, and CREMθ2, all other CREM isoforms lack a glutamine-rich transcriptional activating domain and are therefore considered to function as repressors of cAMP-regulated genes, either by competing with CREB proteins for binding to CRE motifs or by heterodimerizing with CREB proteins and abolishing their transcription activating potential. Expression of the CREM isoforms in BLV-infected cells and recruitment of these CREM isoforms to the BLV promoter through the viral CREs have so far not been investigated. In this study, we have examined the potential expression of CREM proteins in BLV-infected cells and the potential specific binding of CREM proteins to the CRE-like motifs of the U3 BLV LTR region, and we have investigated by transient cotransfection experiments the functional role of the CREMτ isoform in basal and TaxBLV-transactivated BLV promoter activity. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—The mouse B-lymphoid cell line A20 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). A20 cells are BALB/c B-lymphoma cells derived from a spontaneous reticulum cell neoplasm found in an old BALB/cAnN mouse. A20 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml. Human HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml. The YR2 B-cell line is derived from leukemic cells of a BLV-infected sheep and contains a single, monoclonally integrated silent provirus with two mutations in TaxBLV that impair the infectious potential of the integrated provirus (20van den Broeke A.

The YR2 cell line was maintained in OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml. All cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Isolation of PBMCs and Cell Culture Conditions—Blood samples were collected from a healthy sheep by jugular venipuncture, mixed with EDTA as an anticoagulant, and centrifuged at 1,750 × g for 25 min at room temperature. The PBMCs were then isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation (density, 1.129 g/ml; Amersham Biosciences) and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.075% EDTA. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline until the supernatant became clear.

At 20 h post-transfection, transfected cells were mock-treated or treated with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody at a concentration of 6.5 μg/ml (reference 115-006-006, Jackson ImmunoResearch). At 42 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized with respect to protein concentrations using the detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). HeLa cells were transfected with jetPEI™ Transfection Reagent (Polyplus Transfection) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In Vitro Coupled Transcription Translation Reaction—Coupled transcription and translation reactions in wheat germ extracts were performed with the TnT® coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega) under the conditions described by the manufacturer. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 90 min in the presence of the T7 RNA polymerase with 1 μgof coding DNA (pSG-CREB2, pSV-CREMτ-wt, or pSG5). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays and Supershift Assays—Nuclear extracts from YR2 cells or from PBMCs isolated from a healthy sheep were prepared and EMSAs, competition EMSAs, and supershift assays were performed as described previously (10Calomme C.

The sequence of the coding strand of the double-stranded Oct-1 consensus oligonucleotide used as competitor was 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′). For supershift assays, monoclonal antibodies against ATF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-243X) and ATF-2 (catalog number sc-242X) and polyclonal antibodies against human CREB (catalog number sc-240X) and human full-length CREM (catalog number sc-440X) were added at a final concentration of 2 μg/reaction mixture at the beginning of the binding reaction for 20 min before adding the DNA probe (blocking conditions). Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear extracts prepared from BLV-infected YR2 cells or in vitro translated CREB or CREM proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated with anti-CREB (catalog number sc-240) or anti-CREM (catalog number sc-440) antibodies in blocking solution. A second antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (catalog number sc-2054), was used for enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Cell Signaling). Preparation of mRNA and cDNA, RT-PCR Amplification, and Cloning of CREM Isoform—One million YR2 cells were used for extracting RNA (RNeasy mini kit, Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 2 μg of YR2 total RNA and (dT)16 primers (Invitrogen) with the Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase reagent, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). RNaseOUT™ RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen) was added to the RT reaction. The resulting cDNA templates were used directly for PCR. After a denaturation period of 5 min at 95 °C, PCR was performed as follows: 40 cycles for 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 2 min at 72 °C, followed by a final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min.

Primers used for detecting CREM mRNA were designed according to the mouse cDNA sequence (supplemental Fig. S2) and are as follows: 5′-CCG GAA TTC ATG ACC ATG GAA ACA GTT GAA TCC CAG-3′ (this forward primer localized in CREM exon B at the 5′ end of the translational start codon (underlined) contains an added EcoRI restriction site (in boldface)) and 5′-GC TCT AGA CTA ATC TGT TTT GGG AGA GCA AAT GTC-3′ (this reverse primer localized in CREM exon Ib at the 3′ end of the DBD II contains an added XbaI restriction site (in boldface)). The forward primer is located at the most 5′ end of exon B, and the reverse primer is located at the most 3′ end of exon Ib. To control reproducibility of the results, RNA samples used for RT-PCR were collected from three independent cultures of YR2 cells. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and purified using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen). PCR products were restricted with XbaI/EcoRI and inserted into the XbaI/EcoRI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). The resulting constructs were transformed into TOP10 cells, and several independent clones were sequenced. Homology searches in the nucleotide and genomic DNA data bases were performed with BLAST software accessed through the NCBI web page (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The ovine CREMτ1α DNA sequence we cloned is deposited in GenBank™ under accession number EF507802. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed by using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Formaldehyde cross-linking reactions from 107 BLV-infected YR2 cells were performed for 10 min (or 30 min for the detection of CBP recruitment) at room temperature and quenched with 125 mm glycine. Cells were lysed, and chromatin was sonicated to obtain an average DNA length of 600 bp. Following centrifugation, the chromatin was diluted 10-fold and precleared with a protein A-agarose slurry containing salmon sperm DNA and bovine serum albumin (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Precleared chromatin (2 ml) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of either anti-CREB antibody (catalog number sc-186X), anti-ATF-1 antibody (catalog number sc-243X), anti-ATF-2 antibody (catalog number sc-242X), anti-CREM antibody (catalog number sc-440X), anti-CBP (catalog number sc-369X), or normal rabbit IgG antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., catalog number 12-370) as control. Incubation with the antibodies was followed by immunoprecipitation with protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed and eluted twice with 200 μl of elution buffer. The protein-DNA cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C overnight, and 10% of the recovered DNA was used for radioactive PCR amplification (35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min) with a primer set amplifying the BLV TxRE promoter region (nt –172 to +29), 5′-nt-172CCGTAAACCAGACAGAGACGTCAG-3′/5′-nt+29CACGAGGGTCTCAGGAGGAGAAC-3′, or with an unrelated primer set amplifying a gag gene region located ∼1.8 kb downstream of the LTR region (nt +1736 to +1955): 5′-nt+1736CAGCCCTCTCAGAATCAAGC-3′/5′-nt+1955AATTTGCCATTTATCGAAAG-3′. PCR products from all reactions were resolved by PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Endogenous CREM Proteins from Nuclear Extracts of BLV-infected YR2 Cells and of Ovine PBMCs Specifically Bind to the BLV LTR CRE Motifs in Vitro—The potential role of CREM members in regulating BLV gene expression has so far not been examined. CREM is a bZIP protein belonging to the CREB/CREM/ATF family of transcription factors that bind to DNA-regulatory regions via CRE target sequences. As CREM expression is known to be finely regulated in a cell- and tissue-specific manner (16Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8613-8622Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 19Walker W.H. Sanborn B.M. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Res. 2002; 275: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether CREM proteins were expressed in BLV-infected cells, and whether these CREM proteins were able to bind to the BLV LTR CRE motifs. To this end, we performed supershift EMSA experiments using the three 21-bp TxREs as probes. These probes were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from YR2 cells derived from leukemic cells of a BLV-infected sheep (20van den Broeke A. Bagnis C. Ciesiolka M. Cleuter Y. Gelderblom H. Kerkhofs P. Griebel P. Mannoni P. Burny A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1054-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), either mock-treated or treated for 1 h with phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (P + I), a combination known to activate BLV expression (29Kerkhofs P.

Portetelle D. Willems L. Kettmann R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5034-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out in the presence of either a polyclonal anti-CREM antibody (Fig. 1A, lanes 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12) or purified rabbit IgG as control (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10). The anti-CREM antibody is raised against the full-length protein sequence, including the CREM DNA-binding domain present in all CREM isoforms. Therefore, this antibody is predicted to be active against all CREM isoforms. Results presented in Fig. 1 showed that the mock-treated YR2 nuclear extracts formed three major retarded complexes (C1, C2, and C3) when incubated with the TxRE1, TxRE2, or TxRE3 probe (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 5, or 9, respectively). Treatment of BLV-infected YR2 cells with P + I caused an increased binding activity to the TxREs (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2, lanes 5 and 6, and lanes 9 and 10). Because P + I treatment is known to activate BLV expression, these data suggest that initiation of BLV transcription could occur, in response to P + I, through increased recruitment of CREB/CREM/ATF cellular transcription factors at the viral LTR TxREs. To evaluate the specificity of these interactions, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared and used as competitors in EMSAs (Fig. 1B). Binding of proteins in complexes C1, C2, and C3 was shown to be sequence-specific to the CRE motif. Indeed, formation of these complexes was inhibited by a 80-fold molar excess of the unlabeled homologous TxRE1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 4) but not by the same molar excess of an unlabeled TxRE1 oligonucleotide mutated at the CRE site or an unlabeled oligonucleotide with an unrelated sequence containing an Oct-1 consensus binding site (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 4). Addition of the anti-CREM antibody in the binding reactions resulted in the complete (mocktreated cells) or partial (P + I-treated cells) disappearance of the C2 complex concomitant with the appearance of a supershifted complex of lower mobility (S-CREM) but did not modify the migration profile of complexes C1 and C3 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12). In contrast, the presence of the IgG control did not affect formation of complexes C1, C2, and C3 (data not shown), indicating the specificity of the protein-antibody interaction. These results indicated that the C2 complex contained CREM isoform(s). To further evaluate the binding of CREM to the BLV TxREs and its potential heterodimerization with other members of the CREB/CREM/ATF family of transcription factors, we performed additional supershift experiments with antibodies directed against CREB, ATF-1, or ATF-2 alone or in combination with the anti-CREM antibody (Fig. 2A). Addition of the anti-CREB antibody to the binding reaction interfered with formation of complex C2 and resulted in the appearance of a supershifted complex (Fig. 2A, lane 2, 1S-CREB), indicating that CREB is part of complex C2. As shown in Fig. 1, addition of the anti-CREM antibody impaired complex C2 formation concomitant with a supershifted complex with lower mobility (Fig. 2A, lane 3, 2S-CREM), indicating that CREM is part of complex C2. Anti-ATF-1 antibody interfered with formation of complex C2 and caused the appearance of three supershifted complexes (Fig. 2A, lane 4, 3, 3′, 3″S-ATF-1), suggesting the binding of ATF-1 to the BLV TxRE1 in vitro. Finally, addition of the anti-ATF-2 antibody resulted in the appearance of a supershifted complex (Fig. 2A, lane 5, 4S-ATF-2) and the corresponding disappearance of the slower migrating complex C1 (Fig. 2A, lane 5), indicating that formation of this complex results from ATF-2 binding to the TxRE1 in vitro. As negative control, we used the same antibodies in supershift experiments performed with a probe corresponding to the CRE-mutated TxRE1 site (Fig. 2A, lanes 12–16), and we observed that mutation of the CRE motif abolished formation of complexes C1 and C2, indicating that binding of CREB, CREM, ATF-1, and ATF-2 to the BLV TxRE1 was specific to the CRE motif. To evaluate bZIP complex formation on the BLV TxREs, we next performed additional supershift experiments by including combinations of the antibodies in the binding reactions. We observed a dramatic decrease of complex C2 formation concomitant with the appearance of a super-supershifted complex (Fig. 2A, lane 6, 5SS-CREB + CREM) when both the anti-CREB and the anti-CREM antibodies were added to the same binding reaction mixture, indicating that CREM·CREB heterocomplexes bind to the BLV TxRE1. As a control for cross-reactivity between the anti-CREM antibody and the CREB protein, we performed Western blot analysis on CREB (TnT-CREB) and CREMτ (TnT-CREMτ) proteins produced in vitro in a transcription-translation-coupled wheat germ extract reaction (Fig. 2B). This control experiment shows that the anti-CREM antibody had no cross-reactivity with the TNT-CREB protein (Fig. 2B, top panel, lane 3), thereby demonstrating the relevance of the anti-CREM antibody to distinguish between CREM-"
