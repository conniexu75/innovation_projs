https://openalex.org/W2072947251,We demonstrate a tunable Kondo effect realized in small quantum dots. We can switch our dot from a Kondo impurity to a non-Kondo system as the number of electrons on the dot is changed from odd to even. We show that the Kondo temperature can be tuned by means of a gate voltage as a single-particle energy state nears the Fermi energy. Measurements of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of a Coulomb-blockaded dot show good agreement with predictions of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium Kondo effects.

In a fast, single-step reaction, the monomeric alkoxide precursors permeate the array of bulk polystyrene spheres and condense in air at room temperature. Close packed, open-pore structures with 320- to 360-nanometer voids are obtained after calcination of the organic component at 575 degreesC. The examples presented demonstrate the compositional diversity possible with this technique. The resulting highly structured ceramics could have applications in areas ranging from quantum electronics to photocatalysis to battery materials."
https://openalex.org/W2055557491,"Frizzled family proteins have been described as receptors of Wnt signaling molecules. In Drosophila, the two known Frizzled proteins are associated with distinct developmental processes. Genesis of epithelial planar polarity requires Frizzled, whereas Dfz2 affects morphogenesis by wingless-mediated signaling. Dishevelled is required in both signaling pathways. Here, we use genetic and overexpression assays to show that Dishevelled activates JNK cascades. Rescue analysis reveals different protein domain requirements in Dishevelled for the two pathways; the C-terminal DEP domain is essential to rescue planar polarity defects and induce JNK signaling. Furthermore, the planar polarity–specific dsh1 allele is mutated in the DEP domain. Our results indicate that different Wnt/Fz signals activate distinct intracellular pathways, and Dishevelled discriminates among them by distinct domain interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2097981550,"Selective protein kinase inhibitors were developed on the basis of the unexpected binding mode of 2,6,9-trisubstituted purines to the adenosine triphosphate–binding site of the human cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). By iterating chemical library synthesis and biological screening, potent inhibitors of the human CDK2–cyclin A kinase complex and of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc28p were identified. The structural basis for the binding affinity and selectivity was determined by analysis of a three-dimensional crystal structure of a CDK2-inhibitor complex. The cellular effects of these compounds were characterized in mammalian cells and yeast. In the latter case the effects were characterized on a genome-wide scale by monitoring changes in messenger RNA levels in treated cells with high-density oligonucleotide probe arrays. Purine libraries could provide useful tools for analyzing a variety of signaling and regulatory pathways and may lead to the development of new therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1988987622,"The phylogeny of the Phytophaga, the largest and oldest radiation of herbivorous beetles, was reconstructed from 115 complete DNA sequences for the 18S nuclear ribosomal subunit and from 212 morphological characters. The results of these analyses were used to interpret the role of angiosperms in beetle diversification. Jurassic fossils represent basal lineages that are still associated with conifers and cycads. Repeated origins of angiosperm-feeding beetle lineages are associated with enhanced rates of beetle diversification, indicating a series of adaptive radiations. Collectively, these radiations represent nearly half of the species in the order Coleoptera and a similar proportion of herbivorous insect species."

https://openalex.org/W2154395440,"Experimental visualization and verification of a single-molecule rotor operating within a supramolecular bearing is reported. Using a scanning tunneling microscope, single molecules were observed to exist in one of two spatially defined states laterally separated by 0.26 nanometers. One was identified as a rotating state and the other as an immobilized state. Calculations of the energy barrier for rotation of these two states show that it is below the thermal energy at room temperature for the rotating state and above it for the immobilized state."

The fast recession of Pine Island Glacier, predicted to be a possible trigger for the disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is attributed to enhanced basal melting of the glacier floating tongue by warm ocean waters."
https://openalex.org/W2042776102,"Clathrin-coated buds and dynamin-coated tubules morphologically similar to corresponding structures observed in synaptic membranes can be generated on protein-free liposomes by incubation with cytosol, or with clathrin coat proteins and purified dynamin, respectively. Dynamin- and clathrin-coated intermediates may form independently of each other, despite the coupling between the two processes typically observed in synaptic membranes. Formation of both structures on liposomes can occur in the absence of nucleotides. These findings indicate that interfaces between lipids and cytosolic proteins are fully sufficient to deform lipids bilayers into buds and tubules. They suggest that a main function of membrane proteins is to act as positive and negative regulators of coat assembly, therefore controlling these processes in time and space."
https://openalex.org/W1980754944,"The T cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta heterodimer interacts with its ligands with high specificity, but surprisingly low affinity. The role of the zeta component of the murine TCR in contributing to the fidelity of antigen recognition was examined. With sequence-specific phosphotyrosine antibodies, it was found that zeta undergoes a series of ordered phosphorylation events upon TCR engagement. Completion of phosphorylation steps is dependent on the nature of the TCR ligand. Thus, the phosphorylation steps establish thresholds for T cell activation. This study documents the sophisticated molecular events that follow the engagement of a low-affinity receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2163002490,"Avirulent strains of Salmonella typhimurium are being considered as antigen delivery vectors. During its intracellular stage in the host, S. typhimurium resides within a membrane-bound compartment and is not an efficient inducer of class I-restricted immune responses. Viral epitopes were successfully delivered to the host-cell cytosol by using the type III protein secretion system of S. typhimurium. This resulted in class I-restricted immune responses that protected vaccinated animals against lethal infection. This approach may allow the efficient use of S. typhimurium as an antigen delivery system to control infections by pathogens that require this type of immune response for protection."
https://openalex.org/W1979165906,"Aberrations affecting the tumor suppressor gene p16INK4a have been described for a variety of tumors. In breast cancer, approximately 50% of tumors show low or lack p16 expression. While evidence provided by some studies has implicated a possible role for p16 in normal replicative senescence, other studies have suggested that the Rb, pathway through which p16 functions, may not be involved in senescence control. Previously we observed that all immortal lines derived from normal mammary epithelium which were analysed for p16 displayed inactivation of this gene through distinct mechanisms, supporting p16 inactivation as a possible necessary event in escape from senescence. To further clarify this issue, we have analysed p16 expression in a panel of normal finite lifespan human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) from initial propagation through growth arrest, using media which confer different replicative capacity. Approximately 10-25-fold increase in p16 expression was observed for all normal HMEC with initial onset of a senescence phenotype following 15-25 population doublings in culture. These cells also displayed expression of the senescence associated beta-galactosidase. Interestingly, HMEC with additional long term replicative capacity (approximately 80 population doublings) arose from these growth arrested cultures, showing lack of p16 expression. This extended growth capacity appears to be associated with a methylation phenomenon since treatment of these cells with the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine resulted in growth arrest concurrent with reacquisition of p16 expression and senescence associated beta-galactosidase. Analysis of p21waf1 expression revealed no change in expression during growth in vitro. These results support p16INK4a as the 9p senescence gene and suggest a role for p16 loss in the escape from initial onset of senescence and in acquisition of an extended life span of human mammary epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2152678528,"Connections in the developing nervous system are thought to be formed initially by an activity-independent process of axon pathfinding and target selection and subsequently refined by neural activity. Blockade of sodium action potentials by intracranial infusion of tetrodotoxin in cats during the early period when axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were in the process of selecting visual cortex as their target altered the pattern and precision of this thalamocortical projection. The majority of LGN neurons, rather than projecting to visual cortex, elaborated a significant projection within the subplate of cortical areas normally bypassed. Those axons that did project to their correct target were topographically disorganized. Thus, neural activity is required for initial targeting decisions made by thalamic axons as they traverse the subplate."
https://openalex.org/W2079291010,"Benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC), a class of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder of newborns. BFNC has been linked to mutations in two putative K+ channel genes, KCNQ2 andKCNQ3. Amino acid sequence comparison reveals that both genes share strong homology to KvLQT1, the potassium channel encoded byKCNQ1, which is responsible for over 50% of inherited long QT syndrome. Here we describe the cloning, functional expression, and characterization of K+ channels encoded byKCNQ2 and KCNQ3 cDNAs. Individually, expression of KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 in Xenopus oocytes elicits voltage-gated, rapidly activating K+-selective currents similar to KCNQ1. However, unlike KCNQ1, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 currents are not augmented by coexpression with the KCNQ1 β subunit, KCNE1 (minK, IsK). Northern blot analyses reveal that KCNQ2 andKCNQ3 exhibit similar expression patterns in different regions within the brain. Interestingly, coexpression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 results in a substantial synergistic increase in current amplitude. Coexpression of KCNE1 with the two channels strongly suppressed current amplitude and slowed kinetics of activation. The pharmacological and biophysical properties of the K+currents observed in the coinjected oocytes differ somewhat from those observed after injecting either KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 by itself. The functional interaction between KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 provides a framework for understanding how mutations in either channel can cause a form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.

Potassium channels are the largest and most diverse group of ion channels. They are primary regulators of resting membrane potential and action potential configuration and, therefore, modulate excitability of neurons, cardiac myocytes, and other electrically active cells. Recent identification of KCNQ1 (KvLQT1), the gene responsible for more than 50% of inherited cardiac long QT syndrome (LQTS), 1The abbreviations used are: LQTS, long QT syndrome; BFNC, benign familial neonatal convulsions; 4-AP, 4-aminopyridine; TEA, tetraethylammonium; EST, expressed sequence tag; CTX, charybdotoxin. established a new family of six-transmembrane domain K+ channels (1Wang Q.

KCNQ1, in combination with the KCNE1 subunit, encodes the slow component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (2Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G.

In an attempt to identify additional members of the KCNQ1K+ channel gene family, the KCNQ1 sequence was used to search DNA and protein sequence data banks. Two additionalKCNQ1-related genes, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, were identified. Recent publications indicate that mutations in KCNQ2 orKCNQ3 are associated with BFNC, an autosomal dominantly inherited epilepsy in newborns (7Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F.

Preliminary functional characterization of KCNQ2 confirmed that this gene encodes a voltage-activated K+ channel (9Singh N.A. Charlier C. Stauffer D. DuPont B.R. Leacj R.J. Melis R. Ronen G.M. Bjerre I. Quattlebaum T. Murphy J.V. McHarg M.L. Gagnon D. Rosales T.O. Peiffer A. Anderson V.E. Leppert M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Here we describe the cloning, tissue distribution, and functional expression of both KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. More importantly, we demonstrate that these two channels interact functionally with each other and with KCNE1. 5′ Rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction was performed by amplifying human brain or fetal brain cDNA libraries or Marathon-Ready cDNAs (CLONTECH) using primers derived from the KvLQT1-related EST sequences (EST numbers yn72g11, yo31c08, and ys93a07). Polymerase chain reaction products were gel-purified, subcloned, and sequenced. The Gene Trapper experiment was performed using the protocol as described in the manufacturer's manual (Life Technologies Inc.). Random-primed32P-labeled DNA probes containing specific regions ofKCNQ2 or KCNQ3 sequence were used for screening of cDNA libraries and Northern blot analysis using standard protocols. The composite full-length KCNQ2 andKCNQ3 cDNA clones were obtained by restriction enzyme digestion and ligation of overlapping cDNA clones. The full-length cDNAs were subcloned into a Xenopus expression vector, derived from pSP64T plasmid. Capped cRNA for microinjection was synthesized using mMessage mMachine Kit (Ambion) as described (4Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Shalaby F.Y. Blanar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar,6Shalaby F.Y. Levesque P.C. Yang W.-P. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Jenkins-West T. Blanar M.A. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1733-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Stages V and VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were defolliculated with collagenase treatment and injected with cRNAs as described previously (4Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Shalaby F.Y. Blanar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Currents were recorded at room temperature using conventional two-microelectrode voltage clamp (Dagan TEV-200) 3–4 days after injecting KCNQ2 (15 ng), KCNQ3 (15 ng), or KCNE1 (2 ng) cRNA alone or in combination. Microelectrodes (0.8 to 1.5 megaohms) were filled with 3 m KCl. Bath solution contained (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 0.4 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.5). K+ selectivity was assessed by determining the dependence of tail current reversal potential on the external K+ concentration. Tail currents were elicited at potentials of −110 to +10 mV following a voltage step to +20 mV while the external K+ concentration was varied between 2, 10, 40, and 98 mm. Current reversal potential under each condition was determined for each oocyte by measuring the zero intercept from a plot of tail current amplitude versustest potential. KCl was varied in selectivity experiments by equimolar substitution with NaCl. PCLAMP 6.0 software (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and analysis. All data were sampled at rates at least two times the low pass filter rate. Clofilium was obtained from RBI Biochemicals and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), tetraethylammonium (TEA), and charybdotoxin were obtained from Sigma. E-4031 was synthesized at Bristol-Myers Squibb from patents published by Eisai Research Laboratories. KCNQ1-related expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified in a GCG BLAST search of the GenBankTM data base with KCNQ1 sequence. Primers, derived from the consensus sequences of EST clones, were used to amplify human brain-derived cDNA, and 877-base pair and 325-base pair fragments were isolated for KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, respectively. To obtain full-length cDNA sequences of both genes, we employed 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction, screening of cDNA libraries, and Gene Trapper techniques. The composite full-length cDNAs of KCNQ2 andKCNQ3 contain an open reading frame (ORF) encoding an 871- and 854-amino acid polypeptide, respectively. DNA sequence analysis and conceptual translation of both cDNAs reveals that they encode proteins with the structural features of a voltage-gated potassium channel and are most closely related to KCNQ1 (3Sanguinetti M.C.

Blanar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). KCNQ2exhibits a high degree of sequence similarity with KCNQ3(≈70%), indicating that they belong to the same subfamily. Both proteins have a longer C-terminal domain (∼200 amino acids) than KCNQ1. Unlike KCNQ1, which is expressed strongly in human heart and pancreas (1Wang Q. Curran M.E. Splawski I. Burns T.C. Millholland J.M. VanRaay T.J. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Jager T.-D.

A. 1997; 94: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), Northern blot analysis revealed thatKCNQ2- and KCNQ3-specific transcripts are detectable only in human brain (Fig. 1). The sizes of the major transcripts for KCNQ2 andKCNQ3 are 8.5 kilobases and 10.5 kilobases, respectively. Expression of human KCNQ2 is high in the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and amygdala; moderate in the thalamus, and weak in the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and corpus callosum (Fig. 1,top panel). A separate Northern blot demonstrates that expression of human KCNQ2 is high in the cerebral cortex, is moderate in the putamen, temporal lobe, frontal lobe, occipital pole, and cerebellum, and is barely detectable in the medulla and spinal cord (Fig. 1, top panel). A similar pattern of expression was observed previously for KCNQ2 (7Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K. Science. 1998; 279: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Interestingly, KCNQ3 exhibits a nearly identical expression pattern in the brain (Fig. 1, bottom panel). The full-length KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 cDNAs were subcloned into a Xenopus expression vector, and cRNA was generated byin vitro transcription. The properties of the channels encoded by KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were investigated by expressing the transcribed cRNAs in Xenopus oocytes. Depolarizing voltage steps elicited outward currents in oocytes injected with KCNQ2 (Fig. 2 A). The currents activated at potentials positive to −60 mV and showed slight inward rectification at the more positive potentials. Similar currents never were observed in water-injected control oocytes. KCNQ2 currents exhibited a rapidly activating delayed rectifier current phenotype similar to KCNQ1 current (2Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 3Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T.

A. 1997; 94: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows the current-voltage (I-V) relationship for KCNQ2 currents recorded at the end of the 1-s voltage steps. The K+ selectivity of the expressed current was examined by investigation of tail current reversal potentials in bath solutions containing 2, 10, 40, and 98 mm K+. Reversal potentials closely followed the Nernst potential for K+ revealing a predominantly K+-selective channel (Fig. 2 C). The reversal potential for KCNQ2 current shifted by 51 mV per 10-fold change in external K+. Inhibitors of K+ channels were used to investigate the pharmacology of KCNQ2. The effects of 4-AP, E-4031, clofilium, charybdotoxin (CTX), and TEA on KCNQ2 currents recorded from a single oocyte are shown in Fig. 2 D. Each of these compounds also was tested alone in individual oocytes, and the effects of each agent were consistent with the data shown in Fig. 2. CTX (100 nm), a protein from scorpion venom that inhibits a variety of Ca2+-activated and voltage-dependent K+ channels (10Sugg E.E. Garcia M.L. Reuben J.P. Patchett A.A. Kaczorowski G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18745-18748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Miller C. Moczydlowski E. Lotorre R. Phillips M. Nature. 1985; 313: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), did not inhibit KCNQ2 current. CTX also had no effect on KCNQ1 current (not shown). E-4031 (10 μm), a selective inhibitor of the HERG K+channel (12Snyders D.J. Chaudhary A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 949-955PubMed Google Scholar), and 4-AP (2 mm), an inhibitor of Shaker-type K+ channels (13Deal K.K. England S.K. Tamkun M.M. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 49-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), also had no significant effects on KCNQ2 current. Similarly, neither agent inhibits KCNQ1 channels (4Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Shalaby F.Y. Blanar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Clofilium (10 μm), a compound that inhibits KCNQ1 (4Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Shalaby F.Y. Blanar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) with an IC50 <10 μm, had little effect on KCNQ2 current. TEA (1 mm), a nonselective K+channel inhibitor and weak KCNQ1 antagonist (4Yang W.-P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Shalaby F.Y. Blanar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), reduced KCNQ2 current by 90%. A family of currents elicited by depolarizing voltage steps in an oocyte injected with KCNQ3 cRNA are shown in Fig. 2 E. The currents activate at potentials positive to −70 mV and rectify inwardly at potentials greater than 0 mV, as is obvious from the I-V relationship (Fig. 2 F). The KCNQ3 reversal potential shifted 49 mV per 10-fold change in external K+ (Fig.2 G). Thus, although still predominantly selective for K+, KCNQ3 is slightly less K+-selective than KCNQ2. The pharmacology of KCNQ3 was significantly different from that of KCNQ2 (Fig. 2 H). Clofilium (10 μm) reduced KCNQ3 current by 30% from control but had little effect on KCNQ2. TEA, which strongly inhibited KCNQ2 at 1 mm, produced little inhibition of KCNQ3 at 5 mm. CTX (100 nm; not shown), 4-AP (2 mm), and E-4031 (10 μm) also had no effect on KCNQ3 current. Thus, although both KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 encode related voltage-activated K+ channels, significant differences include: (a) degree of rectification at positive voltages, (b) minimum activation voltage, (c) selectivity for K+, and (d) pharmacology. The overlapping expression pattern of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in different brain regions (Fig. 1), together with the fact that mutations in either KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 cause the same inherited epilepsy (BFNC; 7–9), prompted us to test for functional interaction between the two channels. Families of currents elicited by depolarizing voltage steps in oocytes injected with KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 alone and together are shown in Fig. 3 A. Current amplitudes recorded from oocytes coexpressing the two channels were 15-fold greater than in oocytes injected with each of the channels individually. Peak current amplitudes at +30 mV for KCNQ2, KCNQ3, and KCNQ2+KCNQ3 were 0.98 ± 0.09 (n = 6), 0.98 ± 0.06 (n = 5), and 14.2 ± 0.62 μm(n = 6), respectively. Quantitatively similar results were obtained in three separate batches of oocytes. The I-V relationship shows that KCNQ2+KCNQ3 currents activated at potentials positive to −60 mV and did not rectify, unlike KCNQ2 and particularly KCNQ3, at positive voltages (Fig. 3 B). The reversal potential of tail currents shifted by 57 mV per 10-fold change in external K+ indicating that KCNQ2+KCNQ3 is nearly perfectly selective for K+ (Fig. 3 C). KCNQ2+KCNQ3 current is weakly sensitive to inhibition by 5 mm TEA and 10 μm clofilium but not to 100 nm CTX or 2 mm 4-AP (Fig. 3 D). E-4031 (10 μm) also did not inhibit KCNQ2+KCNQ3 current (not shown). These results suggest strongly that KCNQ2+KCNQ3 interact to form a channel with properties distinct from either KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 channels. The β subunit KCNE1 dramatically alters the amplitude and gating kinetics of the KCNQ1 channel (2Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G.

Because KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are members of the same K+ channel subfamily, we tested for an interaction between KCNE1 and KCNQ2+KCNQ3 channels. Fig.4 shows currents elicited by 1-s depolarizing voltage steps in oocytes expressing KCNE1 alone, KCNQ2+KCNQ3, and KCNQ2+KCNQ3+KCNE1. KCNE1 significantly attenuated KCNQ2+KCNQ3 current amplitude and slowed gating kinetics. Peak current amplitude at +30 mV was reduced by 62 ± 6.0% (n= 6) in oocytes coexpressing KCNE1. Activating currents were fitted to a bi-exponential function to determine fast and slow time constants of activation. Fast and slow time constants for activation of KCNQ2+KCNQ3 current at +10 mV were 50.1 ± 3.4 (n = 6) and 239.3 ± 17.5 ms (n = 6), respectively; these were shifted to 124.7 ± 8.8 (n = 5) and 680.7 ± 71.4 ms (n = 6) when KNCE1 was injected together with KCNQ2+KCNQ3. Similar results were obtained in more than 15 oocytes from each group in this and two additional batches of oocytes. KCNE1 currents appear absent because of the duration (1 s) of the voltage steps used and the scale at which the currents are shown; however, as shown clearly in the inset, 5-s voltage steps elicited typical KCNE1 currents in the same oocyte. Whether regions of the brain which coexpress KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 also express KCNE1 remains to be determined. The effect of KCNE1 on gating kinetics is similar for KCNQ1 and KCNQ2+KCNQ3 channels. In contrast, KCNE1 augments KCNQ1 current but inhibits KCNQ2+KCNQ3. Mutations in KCNE1 cause LQTS and produce dominant-negative suppression of KCNQ1 current (15Splawski I. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lehmann M.H. Sanguinetti M.C. Keating M.T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Although KCNE1 has opposite effects on KCNQ1 and KCNQ2+KCNQ3 channels, it will be interesting to determine whether mutations in KCNE1account for altered neuronal excitability. The results explain why mutations in either of two unlinked K+-channel encoding genes yield the same phenotype. BFNC-associated mutations in either KCNQ2 orKCNQ3 could cause a profound reduction in KCNQ2+KCNQ3 current amplitude. Interestingly, a BFNC-causing mutation resulting in an nonfunctional, truncated KCNQ2 protein, failed to produce a dominant-negative inhibition of wild-type KCNQ2 channels expressed in oocytes (7Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K. Science. 1998; 279: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Our results, demonstrating a synergistic interaction between KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, may provide a likely explanation for this finding. That is, mutations in KCNQ2 may only produce dominant-negative effects when coexpressed with wild-type KCNQ3 channels and vice versa. This supports the suggestion from the previous study (7Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K. Science. 1998; 279: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) that dominant-negative effects of KCNQ2 mutants may require a β-subunit or second protein. This information will prove important for the evaluation of functional effects of channel mutations that cause BFNC and perhaps other disorders of neuronal excitability. We thank B.

The α3β3γε complex of TF1 was fixed to a solid surface, and fluorescently labeled actin filament was attached to the ε subunit through biotin-streptavidin. In the presence of ATP, the filament attached to ε subunit rotated in a unidirection. The direction of the rotation was the same as that observed for the γ subunit. The rotational velocity was slightly slower than the filament attached to the γ subunit, probably due to the experimental setup used. Thus, as suggested from biochemical studies (Aggeler, R., Ogilvie, I., and Capaldi, R. A. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 19621–19624), the ε subunit rotates with the γ subunit in F1-ATPase during catalysis.

F0F1-ATP synthase catalyzes ATP synthesis coupled with the proton flow across the energy-transducing membranes such as the plasma membrane of bacteria, mitochondrial inner membrane, and thylakoid membrane of chloroplast (1Senior A.E.

F1-ATPase is the water-soluble portion of F0F1-ATP synthase and contains a catalytic core for ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. The F1-ATPase consists of five kinds of subunits with a stoichiometry of α3β3γ1δ1ε1. The catalytic sites of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis are located mainly on the β subunits, and noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites are located mainly on the α subunits (5Abrahams J.P. Leslie A. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). The α3β3γ subcomplex of F1-ATPase is regarded as a minimum stable complex which has catalytic features similar to F1-ATPase (6Yokoyama K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

Three catalytic sites of F1-ATPase exhibit strong negative cooperativity in ATP binding and positive cooperativity in ATP hydrolysis. To explain these characteristics, a binding change mechanism was proposed (3Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 4Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev.

In the binding change mechanism, all three β subunits in F0F1-ATP synthase are in different states at a given moment and alternately exchange their states during ATP synthesis and hydrolysis.

This conclusion is based upon the synthesis of LCB kinase activity in Escherichia coli expressing eitherLCB gene. LCB4 encodes most (97%)Saccharomyces LCB kinase activity, with the remainder requiring LCB5.

The finding of both intracellular and extracellular SPP receptors is a strong indication that SPP modulates physiological processes.Most studies of SPP published to date have used cultured mammalian cells. Whole animal as well as tissue culture studies would benefit from the availability of a cDNA encoding sphingosine kinase which could be used to verify the physiological significance of SPP signaling and to determine how the level of SPP is regulated. No such cDNA is available, nor has any such gene been identified. Here we present evidence for the identification of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes encoding kinases, referred to as LCB (long chain base) kinases, because they phosphorylate several LCBs including sphingosine. These two genes should expedite future studies of the functions of LCB phosphates inSaccharomyces and in multicellular eukaryotes.DISCUSSIONOur data demonstrate that the LCB4 and LCB5genes of S. cerevisiae encode LCB kinase activity, the first time that genes encoding this type of enzyme have been identified in any organism. This conclusion is based upon the complete lack of LCB kinase enzyme activity in an lcb4 lcb5 double deletion strain (Table II), upon the production of LCB kinase activity inE. coli cells expressing either LCB4 orLCB5 but not in cells carrying only the vector (Fig. 4), and finally, the demonstration that a lcb4 deletion mutant does not make any detectable DHS-1-P or PHS-1-P in vivo under conditions where the parental strain makes both compounds (Fig. 5).Identification of the LCB4 gene was based upon the observation that a strain lacking the DPL1 gene, believed to encode LCB phosphate lyase activity, is more sensitive to and is growth-inhibited by lower concentrations of sphingosine than is the parental strain (22Saba D.J. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In the presence of sphingosine the mutant cells accumulate SPP (22Saba D.J. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) which is believed to inhibit growth, although the mechanism is unclear (25Skrzypek M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data support the idea that SPP is growth-inhibiting since mutation of lcb4 resulted in both the loss of more than 95% of cellular LCB kinase activity, and it allowed growth in the presence of an inhibitory concentration of sphingosine. Because SPP appears to inhibit growth it may be that under some physiological circumstances DHS-1-P, PHS-1-P, or both are used by yeast cells to modulate growth.The predicted Lcb4 and Lcb5 proteins are paralogs that show no similarity to known proteins. They thus represent a new class of lipid kinase. They appear to be related to proteins with unknown functions including one from S. pombe (Fig. 3) and ones encoded by mouse and human expressed sequence tags (e.g. GenBankAA107451, D31133, R74736, and N55929). The two most conserved portions of the LCB kinases are in the middle and the COOH terminus of the proteins (Fig. 4). The functions of these regions and the less conserved NH2 terminus remain to be determined.S. cerevisiae cells contain a high level of LCB kinase activity in the 100,000 × g pellet fraction based upon a specific activity of 4,500 pmol/mg/min (Table II). This value is more than four times the value of 1,080 pmol/mg/min for LCB kinase activity in corn shoot microsomes (19Crowther G.J. Lynch D.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and 100 times greater than the value of 40 pmol/mg/min from bovine brain (26Louie D.D. Kisic A. Schroefer Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4557-4564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). About two-thirds of the Lcb4 and one-third of the Lcb5 enzyme activity are found in the pellet fraction of the cell (Table II). It remains to be determined if the proteins are retained within the lumen of an organelle or if they are bound to a membrane. Neither protein has a predicted transmembrane spanning domain nor an attachment site for a lipid anchor, so if the proteins are binding to a membrane, they must do so through protein-protein interaction or through a novel lipid anchor motif. In platelets, sphingosine kinase is primarily a soluble enzyme, whereas in rat brain and other tissues it is peripherally associated with membranes (21Buehrer B.M. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar). About 80% of the activity in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 neuronal cells is soluble and the other 20% is in the particulate fraction (27Rius R.A. Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), where it is presumed to be membrane-bound. It should now be possible to determine the mechanism and the circumstances under which Lcb4 and Lcb5 enzyme activity distribute between the membrane and soluble fractions. This information may help to elucidate why sphingosine kinase activity is in a similar fraction in mammalian cells. Other lipid kinases have been shown to bind to membranes in a regulated manner (28Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar), and it will be important to determine if LCB kinases show similar behavior.Most of the LCB kinase activity in JK9-3a cells is encoded byLCB4 (Δlcb5, strain RCD164, Table II), and this kinase synthesizes all of the DHS-1-P and PHS-1-P present in log phase cells grown in rich medium because neither of these compounds was found in cells making only the Lcb5 kinase (Δlcb4, strain RCD158, Fig. 5). Our data do not eliminate the possibility that LCB phosphates made by the Lcb5 kinase are very short lived and present at a very low concentration. The function of the Lcb5 kinase may be very specialized and depend upon its cellular location. Alternatively, theLCB5 gene may just be a remnant of the genome duplication event that occurred in S. cerevisiae (29Wolfe H.W. Shields D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). This possibility seems unlikely, however, because a nonessential gene would be expected to become mutated and no longer encode an active enzyme. Mice and humans also seem to have more than one species of LCB kinase based upon our analysis of homologs predicted to be encoded by expressed sequence tags. Retention of multiple species of LCB kinases over a long evolutionary time span suggests that they perform specialized functions.All eukaryotes examined to date have LCB kinase activity, indicating that this enzyme provides survival value to cells. Besides its presumed role in generating signaling molecules, it is essential for catabolizing LCBs to yield phosphoethanolamine, which serves as a precursor for synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. The physiological importance of this metabolic conduit from sphingolipid to glycerophospholipid metabolism has not been determined. The LCB4 and LCB5 genes make it possible to examine the role of this metabolic pathway in S. cerevisiae cells. Cells lacking both genes grow normally in rich and synthetic medium (data not shown), indicating that LCB phosphates and flux through this metabolic pathway are not necessary for a normal rate of growth with glucose as the carbon source, at least not under short term laboratory conditions. Other phenotypes await analysis as does the role of LCB phosphates as second messengers during stress responses (30Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).If the putative human and mouse expressed sequence tags do indeed encode homologs of the yeast LCB kinases, it should be possible to use them to manipulate the level of SPP in mammals and thereby establish the physiological functions of SPP.AddendumAfter submission of this manuscript for publication, Olivera et al.

https://openalex.org/W2094220982,"The ratio of late to early events stimulated by the mast cell receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) correlated with the affinity of a ligand for the receptor-bound IgE. Because excess receptors clustered by a weakly binding ligand could hoard a critical initiating kinase, they prevented the outnumbered clusters engendered by the high-affinity ligands from launching the more complete cascade. A similar mechanism could explain the antagonistic action of some peptides on the activation of T cells."

This correlation is more significant than that between hot spots and negative velocity anomalies in tomographic models of deep mantle compressional and shear velocity. This correlation is consistent with the notion that many hot spots originate in a low-velocity, probably partially molten layer at the core-mantle boundary and undergo little lateral deflection on ascent."

Strikingly, these potency changes were in opposite directions suggesting Tyr95 contributes both positive and negative determinants of antagonist potency. To gain insight into how the Y95F mutant might influence mazindol potency, we determined how structural variants of mazindol responded to the mutation.

Acta. 1994; 1197: 133-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the SERT amino acid sequence predicts 12 TMDs, a large extracellular loop between TMD III and TMD IV with multiple sites forN-linked glycosylation, and multiple consensus sequences in the intracellular domains for possible phosphorylation by protein kinases. Although inconsistencies have been reported for the 12 TMD model (15Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

For example, the location of a cysteine residue in the proposed extracellular loop between predicted TMDs I and II of SERT has been confirmed (17Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and the extracellular locations of other putative domains including the large N-glycosylated loop between TMDs III and IV have been verified for both SERT (18Tate C.G.

Knowledge of SERT primary structure provides opportunities for probing structural determinants of SERT function and may contribute to a better understanding of ligand recognition and structure for all of the biogenic amine transporters. Thus, we have focused on identifying which components of the proposed 12 TMD structure of SERT participate in forming the binding pocket for substrates and antagonists. In this regard, conserved amino acid sequences are thought to be responsible for common properties among homologous structures, whereas sequence differences can reveal areas responsible for the unique properties of a protein. Mutagenesis and chimera studies with the catecholamine transporters, NET and DAT, have suggested that the major determinants of the various functions of these transport proteins can be attributed to discrete domains of the proteins structure (23Kitayama S.

A useful strategy for identifying ligand binding domains of G protein-coupled receptors and ion channels has been the exploitation of species differences in antagonist potencies, in which cross-species chimeras and site-directed mutagenesis localize domains and residues critical for ligand interaction (28Fong T.M. Yu H. Strader C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25668-25671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Oksenberg D. Marsters S.A. ODowd B.F. Jin H. Havlik S. Peroutka S.J. Ashkenazi A.

Previously, such cross-species comparisons of SERT demonstrated differences in tricyclic antidepressant and amphetamine potency between rat and human SERTs localized by chimera studies to carboxyl-terminal regions of the protein (31Barker E.L. Kimmel H.L. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 799-807PubMed Google Scholar). Follow-up studies using site-directed mutagenesis identified a single amino acid in TMD XII responsible for the species selectivity of the tricyclic antidepressants (32Barker E.L. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 957-965PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that analyses of pharmacologic differences evident between more distantly related SERTs, such as Drosophila and human SERTs (9Ramamoorthy S. Bauman A.L. Moore K.R. Han H. Yang Feng T.

A. 1994; 91: 1188-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), might allow for additional insights into key structural domains for ligand recognition. dSERT is a protein of 622 amino acids with the same proposed 12 TMD topology modeled for mammalian SERTs. The sequences of the dSERT and hSERT share an overall amino acid identity of 49% which increases to 58% when considering only the TMDs (10Demchyshyn L.L. Pristupa Z.B. Sugamori K.S. Barker E.L. Blakely R.D. Wolfgang W.J. Forte M.A. Niznik H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5158-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In order to compare the properties of hSERT and dSERT expressed in the same host cells, we have performed 5-HT uptake assays in HeLa cells transiently transfected with either SERT species homolog. These studies confirmed that hSERT and dSERT have markedly different sensitivities to some, but not all, biogenic amine transporter antagonists, although 5-HT transport kinetics are essentially equivalent. Specifically, most antagonists such as fluoxetine and citalopram were much less potent at dSERT with the one exception being the NET/DAT-selective antagonist mazindol which exhibited greater potency for dSERT as compared with hSERT. Using hSERT/dSERT chimeras and species-scanning mutagenesis, we have tracked the determinant of species-specific recognition of the antagonists mazindol and citalopram to an aromatic residue located in TMD I. Selective effects on the potency of cocaine induced by substitutions at this position support a contribution of TMD I to the binding pocket for phenyltropane antagonists as well. SERT species homologs and mutants also were analyzed using multiple mazindol derivatives, thereby identifying critical functional groups of mazindol likely to participate in TMD I interactions with SERTs. Our findings reveal molecular information regarding potential ligand-protein interactions between mazindol and monoamine transporters and support the role of TMD I in the formation of antagonist-binding sites. Antibodies targeted to the carboxyl tail of hSERT have been described (19Qian Y. Melikian H.E. Rye D.B. Levey A.I. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1261-1274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and could be used for detection of chimeric proteins when a chimera contained the hSERT carboxyl tail (19Qian Y. Melikian H.E. Rye D.B. Levey A.I. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1261-1274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, antibodies against the amino-tail of hSERT or any portion of dSERT suitable for immunoblotting do not exist, hindering our ability to perform protein analysis on expression of other chimeras. Therefore, an epitope (YPYDVPDYA) derived from a viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein (33Wadzinski B.E. Eisfelder B.J. Peruski Jr., L.F. Mumby M.C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16883-16888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the amino terminus of the hSERT cDNA for immunochemical detection of the protein using commercial anti-HA antibodies (Babco). The HA epitope was introduced into the parental hSERT using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overlap extension method (34Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar, 35Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) using Vent DNA polymerase for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min, with a 10-min extension time at cycles 1 and 30. The oligonucleotide primers (sense, 5′-TATCCATATGATGTTCCAGATTATGCTGAGACGACGCCCTTGAATTC-3′; antisense, 5′-AGCATAATCTGGAACATCATATGGATACATCCTGCTGGTTAGTAAATG-3′) that encoded the HA tag also introduced a unique NdeI restriction endonuclease site that allowed for easy identification of HA tag-containing plasmids. The 650-base pair PCR product and the parental hSERT cDNA were digested with XcmI restriction enzyme, and the two fragments were ligated using T4 DNA ligase after gel purification. Dideoxy sequencing (36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) of this ligated region confirmed the presence of the HA tag in the proper orientation and confirmed that no other sequence changes were introduced during construction. Human and Drosophila SERT chimeras were generated using the previously described restriction site-independent method of chimera formation (37Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar, 38Barker E.L. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Neurotransmitter transporters: A Volume of Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998Google Scholar). Briefly, the parental cDNAs, HA/hSERT and dSERT, were subcloned into a tandem tail-to-head construct in the vector pBluescriptII KS−. The tandem insert construct T7HA/hSERT-dSERT was generated by transferring the HA/hSERT cDNADraIII-KpnI fragment into the dSERT plasmid upstream of the dSERT cDNA. The T7 HA/hSERT-dSERT construct was then digested between the two SERT cDNAs usingStuI and KpnI, and the linearized DNA containing the two SERT cDNAs was gel-purified. 100–500 ng of purified DNA was transformed into competent DH5α bacteria and plated on selective media to obtain colonies containing recircularized plasmids. In a similar manner, the complimentary tandem plasmid, T7dSERT-HA/hSERT, was constructed using theDraIII-XbaI fragment of dSERT inserted upstream to HA/hSERT cDNA. The tandem construct was then linearized withNdeI and XbaI and transformed as described previously. Colonies were screened for chimeric DNA by subjecting DNA to agarose gel electrophoresis immediately following alkaline lysis (cracking preparation). Colonies with plasmid sizes indicating retention of only a single transporter sized insert were isolated by miniprep DNA preparations and plasmid DNA diagnostically digested with restriction enzymes to localize the region of the internal chimeric switch point. Dideoxy sequencing confirmed the location of the chimera switch point and established that the junction was formed in-frame with respect to the coding sequences of the parental transporters. Two in-frame chimeras were recovered and characterized as follows: D1–136H137–625 (amino acids 1–136 from dSERT with remainder from hSERT) and H1–118 D119–627 (amino acids 1–118 from hSERT with remainder from the Drosophila homolog) (Fig. 1). An additional chimera H1–449D450–631 was generated by using complementary restriction enzyme sites found in the two SERT species variants. Initially, a BclI restriction site was introduced at position 1730 of dSERT using the Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The new BclI site does not alter the coding sequence of the dSERT cDNA but corresponds to the BclI site at position 1409 of the HA/hSERT cDNA. After digesting the two SERT cDNA constructs with XmnI and BclI, the 2346-base pair dSERT fragment and the 2465 HA/hSERT fragment were ligated together to create the chimera H1–449D450–631 (amino acids 1–449 from hSERT and the remaining amino acids from dSERT) (Fig.1). Point mutations were introduced into the wild-type hSERT or dSERT cDNAs by using of the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The wild-type hSERT cDNA was used instead of the HA/hSERT cDNA for mutation constructs because the HA epitope was not required for identification of the point mutants, and the properties of the two SERTs were identical. A “species-scanning” mutagenesis strategy was used which consists of changing residues in one species of SERT to the corresponding identity in the other species variant. Oligonucleotides used for the mutagenesis introduced both an amino acid mutation and a unique restriction site to provide for facile screening of mutants. The following mutations were made to introduce a dSERT identity in the hSERT cDNA: in TMD I, S91A, and Y95F, and in TMD II, L119V, T122C, I123L, M124F, A125L, and I130L. In addition, we converted dSERT Phe90 to Tyr and hNET Phe72 to Tyr, the reciprocal mutation of hSERT Y95F. Complementary sense and antisense primers were annealed to the cDNA of interest and extended with Pfu polymerase. Following the QuikChange kit protocol, the nicked, circular strands were digested withDpnI to eliminate the methylated, nonmutant parental strands. The DNA was transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetentEscherichia coli cells (Stratagene), and colonies were screened using PCR primers on either side of the mutation and then digested with the diagnostic restriction enzyme. Once mutant colonies were identified, the plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced through the mutation-containing region. The fragment containing the mutations in hSERT was isolated by digestion with XbaI andNsiI, gel-purified, and ligated into theXba/Nsi-digested wild-type hSERT vector. A similar digestion and ligation procedure was performed in the formation of the dSERT F90Y mutant using BsmI and NarI. Ligated DNA was transformed into supercompetent XL1-Blue cells, PCR-screened again for the presence of diagnostic restriction sites, and sequenced before use in 5-HT transport assays. In order to compare directly the pharmacological profiles of hSERT (9Ramamoorthy S. Bauman A.L. Moore K.R. Han H. Yang Feng T. Chang A.S. Ganapathy V. Blakely R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The parental cDNAs, hSERT and dSERT, were previously cloned into the plasmids pBluescript II KS− and pBluescript II SK+, respectively. In each case, sense RNA is transcribed by the plasmid-encoded T7 RNA polymerase promoter. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells plated in 24-well culture plates (100,000 cells per well) were infected with recombinant VVT7–3 vaccinia virus encoding T7 RNA polymerase at 10 plaque-forming units per cell as described (39Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 40Fuerst T.R. Niles E. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Virus infection of the cells proceeded for 30 min in serum-free Opti-MEM I containing 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C. Following virus infection, SERT cDNA constructs were transfected into virus-infected HeLa cells using liposome-mediated transfection (Lipofectin reagent) at 100 ng of DNA per well at a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 3 μg of Lipofectin (mixed in Opti-MEM I/β-mercaptoethanol). At 6 h postinfection, HeLa cells were washed with a Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH) buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4). Cells were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in KRH containing 0.18 g/liter d-glucose and then transport assays with 10 nm [3H]-5-HT, 100 μmpargyline, and 100 μml-ascorbic acid were performed for 10 min at 37 °C. Inhibitors were added in the preincubation step. Saturation kinetics were determined using increasing concentrations of [3H]5-HT with the specific activity diluted to ∼0.1 Ci/mmol with unlabeled 5-HT. Uptake was terminated by three washes with ice-cold KRH buffer. The level of accumulated [3H]5-HT was determined either by solubilizing cells in 1% SDS and analysis by liquid scintillation spectrometry or by solubilizing directly in scintillant (Optiphase SuperMix) with direct counting of culture plate in a Wallac MicroBeta plate reader. Nonspecific [3H]5-HT transport was assessed by parallel transfections with the host plasmid pBluescript SK II(−) alone and subtracted from the total counts. SubstrateKm and antagonist Ki values were derived by nonlinear least-square fits (Kaleidagraph; Synergy Software) using either the Hill equation for a rectangular hyperbola or the four-parameter logistic equation with necessary adjustments of IC50 values for substrate concentration to determine apparent Ki values (41Cheng Y.

An 17 O excess up to 7.5 per mil was observed in summer at high northern latitudes. The major source of this puzzling fractionation in this important trace gas is its dominant atmospheric removal reaction, CO + OH → CO 2 + H, in which the surviving CO gains excess 17 O. The occurrence of mass-independent fractionation in the reaction of CO with OH raises fundamental questions about kinetic processes. At the same time the effect is a useful marker for the degree to which CO in the atmosphere has been reacting with OH."

All three substitutions resulted in about 100-fold decrease of the bimolecular rate constants for hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine; however, whereas replacements of Gly-120 and Gly-121 affected only the turnover number, mutation of residue Gly-122 had an effect also on the Michaelis constant.

Reactivity of both mutants toward TMTFA was 2000–11,000-fold lower than that of the wild type HuAChE; however, the G121A enzyme exhibited a rapid inhibition pattern, as opposed to the slow binding kinetics shown by the G122A enzyme. For both phosphates (diethyl phosphorofluoridate, diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, and paraoxon) and phosphonates (sarin and soman), the decrease in inhibitory activity toward the G121A enzyme was very substantial (2000–6700-fold), irrespective of size of the alkoxy substituents on the phosphorus atom.

Another important component of the AChE active center functional architecture is an arrangement of hydrogen bond donors that can stabilize the tetrahedral transition enzyme-substrate complex through accommodation of the negatively charged carbonyl oxygen (14Kraut J.

Storer A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The contribution of the amide nitrogen of Ala-204, rather than that of the catalytic Ser-203, to the oxyanion hole is consistent with the reverse handedness of the catalytic triads in AChE compared with serine proteases (1Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). Residues Gly-121, Gly-122, and Gly-120 are part of a flexible “glycine loop” which constitutes one of the gorge walls adjacent to the catalytic serine and, due to the narrow dimensions of the gorge bottom, should be in contact with most of the AChE noncovalent ligands (1Sussman J.L.

Sussman J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The notion that, apart from its role in accommodating the oxyanion, this loop is one of the important determinants of the active center geometry was recently supported by the x-ray structure of the huperzine A-TcAChE complex (4Raves M.L. Harel M. Pang Y.-P. Silman I. Kozikowski A.P. Sussman J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In this structure the conformation of Gly-121 is different from that observed in other TcAChE-ligand complexes, demonstrating the flexibility of the loop and the extent of its interaction with the ligand. Such conformational mobility of the glycine loop implies that its function may be modified by single replacements of Gly-120(117), Gly-121(118), and Gly-122(119). It was reported (17Millard C.B. Lockridge O. Broomfield C.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15925-15933Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Loewenstein-Lichtenstein Y. Glick D. Gluzman N. Sternfeld M. Zakut H. Soreq H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1423-1431PubMed Google Scholar) that replacements of some of the analogous glycine residues in butyrylcholinesterase resulted in enzyme (G115(117)A) exhibiting diminished affinity toward tacrine, but not toward BW284C51, or in enzymes (G117(119)E and the G117(119)H) retaining a nearly wild type catalytic activity toward butyrylthiocholine (BTC). In HuAChE, our past attempts to introduce large residues (e.g. histidine, glutamate, and serine) at position 122 yielded no protein, underscoring the different active center void volumes of the two enzymes. Here we describe the construction of HuAChE enzymes with modified oxyanion hole, through substitution of Gly-121 and Gly-122 by alanine, and examine their reactivity toward substrates and a variety of covalent and noncovalent active center inhibitors. We show that reactivity of the mutants is indeed affected mainly by steric and conformational changes in the glycine loop. Furthermore, the similar changes in catalytic activity due to replacement of the adjacent residue Gly-120, which is not part of the oxyanion hole, may be also attributed to conformational mobility of the glycine loop. These results further define the functional architecture of HuAChE-active center and its role in the enzyme reactivity. Mutagenesis of AChE was performed by DNA cassette replacement into a HuAChE sequence variant (Ew4) which conserves the wild type (22Soreq H. Ben-Aziz R. Prody C.A. Seidman S. Gnatt A. Neville A.

S-3,3-Dimethylbutyl thioacetate (TB) was synthesized as described previously (6Ordentlich A. Barak D. Kronman C. Flashner Y. Leitner M. Segall Y. Ariel N. Cohen S. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17083-17095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diethyl phosphorofluoridate (DEFP) was prepared according to the procedure by Saunders and Stacy (19Saunders B.C. Stacy G.J. J. Chem. Soc. (Lond.). 1948; : 695-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of 2-propyl methylphosphonofluoridate (sarin) and 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl methylphosphonofluoridate (soman) followed an accepted synthetic procedure using methylphosphonodifluoride (20Monard C. Quinchon J. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1961; : 1084-1085Google Scholar) and the appropriate alcohol. m-(N,N,N-Trimethylammonio)trifluoroacetophenone (TMTFA) was prepared according to the procedure described by Nairet al. (21Nair H.K. Lee K. Quinn D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9939-9941Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). AChE activity was assayed according to Ellman et al. (25Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21719) Google Scholar) (in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.3 mm5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 50 mm sodium-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and various concentrations of ATC), carried out at 27 °C, and monitored by a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Values of inhibition constants (Ki) for the noncovalent inhibitors edrophonium, tacrine, and huperzine A were determined from the effects of various concentrations of the inhibitor on Km and Vmax of the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATC. All the HuAChE enzymes examined formed rapid equilibria with the tested inhibitors, allowing for an immediate addition of increasing amounts of enzyme to the ATC/inhibitor mixture (preincubation of the enzymes with huperzine A for 10 min, before addition of the substrate, or simultaneous mixing yielded the same results). The values of Ki were computed from the secondary plots of the values ofKm/Vmax (determined from slopes of 1/V versus 1/[S]) versusconcentrations of the respective inhibitors as described previously (26Ashani Y. Grunewald J. Kronman C. Velan B. Shafferman A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 555-560PubMed Google Scholar). The rate constants of progression of the carbamylation reactions (see Scheme 1) were estimated for at least four different concentrations (and at least 10-fold in ligand concentration, around the estimated value of Kd) of carbamate (CX), by adding substrate at various time intervals, and measuring the enzyme residual activity (E). The apparent bimolecular carbamylation rate constants (ki), at different carbamate concentrations, were computed from the plot of slopes of ln(E) versus time. Only the initial slopes were considered in order to minimize the errors due to reactivation of the carbamylated enzymes. Double-reciprocal plot of kiversus [CX] were used to compute k2and Kd from the intercept and from the ratio of the slope and the intercept, respectively, according to the following equations: 1/k = 1/k2 + 1/ki[CX]; Kd =k2/ki (27Aldrich W.N. Reiner E. Enzyme Inhibitors as Substrates. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1972: 245Google Scholar). Note that whenk−1 ≫k2,Kd approaches the value of dissociation constant for the corresponding Michaelis complex. Determination of the apparent bimolecular rate constants (ki) for the irreversible inhibition of HuAChE enzymes by organophosphates and organophosphonates as well as estimation of the dissociation constants Kd and the first-order phosphorylation rate constants (k2) for paraoxon and DFP were carried out as described before (10Ordentlich A.

The apparent first-order rate constants for the time-dependent inhibition of the wild type and the G122A HuAChE enzymes by TMTFA were determined by periodically measuring the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis of aliquots of the reaction mixture. The inhibitor concentrations used were 7.5–75 nmfor the wild type and 5.0–50 μm for the G122A HuAChEs. Following the kinetic treatment of Nair et al. (21Nair H.K. Lee K. Quinn D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9939-9941Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and assuming a two-state inhibition mechanism (Scheme 2), the values ofkon and koff could be estimated from the linear plots of kobs versus inhibitor concentration according to Equation1. kobs=kon′[TMTFA]+koffEquation 1 E+TMTFAket⇌koffkonE­TMTFAScheme 2 Since in aqueous solution TMTFA is a mixture of the free ketone (TMTFAket) and the ketone hydrate (TMTFAhyd), corrected values of the association rate constants were obtained from kon = k′on (1 + [TMTFAhyd]/[TMTFAket]), using the ratio of hydrated and ketone forms of TMTFA (62,500), as determined by19F NMR (21Nair H.K. Lee K. Quinn D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9939-9941Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To measure directly the values of koff, the enzyme was inhibited by excess TMTFA (over 90% inhibition), and the mixture was filtered rapidly through a column (Ultrafree-Biomax30k, Millipore) to remove free inhibitor. Regeneration of enzymatic activity for the wild type and the G122A enzymes followed first-order kinetics, yielding values of the dissociation rate constants (koff). For adduct of the G121A HuAChE, activity was completely restored within processing time required for removal of the free inhibitor. TMTFA behaved toward this enzyme as a rapid reversible inhibitor, and the corresponding inhibition constant (Ki) could be determined as described above for noncovalent inhibitors. Models of the tetrahedral adducts of wild type, G120A, G121A, and G122A HuAChEs with ATC and TMTFA were performed on an Indigo 2 workstation using SYBYL modeling software (Tripos Inc.). Initial models of the substrate adducts were constructed as described before (6Ordentlich A. Barak D. Kronman C. Flashner Y. Leitner M. Segall Y. Ariel N. Cohen S. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17083-17095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and those of TMTFA were built in analogy to the x-ray structure of the TcAChE-TMTFA conjugate (3Harel M. Quinn D.M. Nair H.K. Silman I. Sussman J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2340-2346Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The resulting structures were optimized by molecular mechanics using the AMBER and the MAXMIN force fields (with AMBER charge parameters for the enzyme). For most of the starting geometries, for adducts of the G120A and G121A enzymes, a conformational flip of residue at position 121 occurred during the optimization process. Replacement of residue Gly-121 by alanine resulted in an enzyme with a 100-fold lower value of the turnover number (kcat) for both ATC and its noncharged analog TB (Table I; for structures see Fig. 1), as compared with the wild type HuAChE. On the other hand, this substitution had only a limited effect on the Km values for both substrates. Past studies with these isosteric substrates demonstrated that in their respective Michaelis complexes with HuAChE the alkoxy substituents are accommodated in a different manner (6Ordentlich A. Barak D. Kronman C. Flashner Y. Leitner M. Segall Y. Ariel N. Cohen S. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17083-17095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of significant effect on the values of Km for either substrate may suggest that during the formation of Michaelis complexes there is no significant stabilization due to interaction of the substrate carbonyl moieties with the oxyanion hole. Replacement of the second oxyanion hole element Gly-122 by alanine also resulted in similar decreases in the values of kcat for ATC and TB (18- and 15-fold, respectively). However, for this enzyme theKm value for ATC was also affected (6-fold), whereas practically no effect was observed on the corresponding value for TB (Table I). As in the case of the G121A enzyme the nearly equivalent decrease in the turnover numbers for both substrates indicates that the structural modification of the oxyanion hole affects mainly interactions with the substrate acyl moiety. Replacement of Gly-120 by alanine was carried out assuming that although this residue is not a constituent of the oxyanion hole, its substitution may affect the conformation of the glycine loop. Indeed, the effects on the catalytic parameters for ATC are similar to those observed for the G121A enzyme (see Table I), suggesting that the structure of the loop may be similarly affected by the two replacements. However, since the poorly expressed G120A enzyme could be obtained only in extremely low quantities and due to the limited solubility of TB in water, kinetic studies with the noncharged substrate could not be carried out.Table IKinetic constants for ATC and TB hydrolysis by HuAChE and its derivativesAChE typeKmkcatkappaThe apparent bimolecular rate constant (kapp) was calculated from the ratiokcat/Km.ΔΔG bΔΔG # represents the change in free energy relative to the wild type enzyme required to reach the transition state (ES#), evaluated from the effect of mutation on the value of kapp.ATCTBATCTBATCTBATCTBmm×10−5 min−1× 10−8 m−1 min−1kcal/molWT0.10.334.00.3400.9G120A0.05—cLow availability of the G121A enzyme and limitation of TB aqueous solubility precluded examination of this reaction.0.06—cLow availability of the G121A enzyme and limitation of TB aqueous solubility precluded examination of this reaction.1.2—cLow availability of the G121A enzyme and limitation of TB aqueous solubility precluded examination of this reaction.2.09—cLow availability of the G121A enzyme and limitation of TB aqueous solubility precluded examination of this reaction.G121A0.10.90.040.0030.40.0032.753.4G122A0.570.440.220.020.40.052.751.72Values represent mean of triplicate determinations with standard deviation not exceeding 20%.a The apparent bimolecular rate constant (kapp) was calculated from the ratiokcat/Km.b ΔΔG # represents the change in free energy relative to the wild type enzyme required to reach the transition state (ES#), evaluated from the effect of mutation on the value of kapp.c Low availability of the G121A enzyme and limitation of TB aqueous solubility precluded examination of this reaction.

On the other hand, nothing is known about the structure ofZ-prenyl chain-elongating enzymes. Consequently, only limited information is available about the molecular mechanism of enzymatic Z-prenyl chain elongation. In bacteria, undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UPS) catalyzes theZ-prenyl chain elongation onto (all-E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as a primer to yield undecaprenyl diphosphate (UPP), a C55-prenyl diphosphate withE,Z-mixed stereochemistry (18Allen C.M.

Ribonuclease and acid phosphatase were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Micrococcus luteus B-P 26 was used as the source for chromosomal DNA. Escherichia coli JM109 was used as the host for the M. luteus B-P 26 DNA library. The plasmids pFP00 and pHX06, which carry the genes for FPS and HexPS of M. luteus B-P 26, respectively, were described in our recent paper (21Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LB broth (10 g of Bacto-tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of NaCl dissolved in 1 liter of water), supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, where appropriate, was used to propagate bacterial strains unless otherwise stated. The pET expression system was obtained from Novagen, Inc. Restriction enzyme digestions, transformations, and other standard molecular biology techniques were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The procedure was essentially similar to that developed by Raetz (23Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2274-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On a sterilized nylon membrane (0.2-μm grid of the mesh Biodyne A, 82-mm diameter, Pall), which had been placed on an LB-agar plate containing ampicillin, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), E. coli transformants were inoculated and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. Several sheets of the replica filter were prepared by filter-to-filter contact followed by incubation at 37 °C for another 6 h on a fresh LB-agar plate containing ampicillin to propagate bacterial cells. The master filter was also laid on a fresh LB-agar plate containing ampicillin, incubated at 37 °C for another 3 h, and then kept at 4 °C until use. Each of the replica filters was removed from the plate, floated on a 0.6-ml TE buffer solution (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mmEDTA) in a plastic Petri dish lid, keeping the colony side up to wash out residual nutrient broth absorbed in the filter. Then the filters were placed on a paper towel to remove the water. The incubation mixtures for the direct assay of the replica filter contained, in a final volume of 0.6 ml, 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μm DMAPP, 0.46 μm [1-14C]IPP (specific activity, 1.95 TBq/mol) (Conditions I) or 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 μm FPP or Z-GGPP, and 0.46 μm[1-14C]IPP (Conditions II). The replica filter was floated on one of the assay mixtures in a Petri dish keeping the colony side up. Then the Petri dishes were placed in a sealed plastic bag with a wetted paper towel and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. After incubation, the filters were placed on a paper towel and kept at room temperature for 30 min to remove water from the filter. The initial concentration of [1-14C]IPP was set up low enough to reduce background signals from unreacted substrates without washing them out from the filter. The filters were then wrapped with Saran Wrap and exposed on a Fuji film BAS-IIIs imaging plate at room temperature. The distributions of radioactivity in the filters were analyzed with a Fuji BAS 1000 Mac bioimaging analyzer to detect positive colonies. M. luteus B-P 26 grown in 2 liters of L (Lennox) broth (10 g of Bacto-tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, and 1 g of glucose dissolved in 1 liter of water) at 30 °C was harvested in the late log phase, and the chromosomal DNA was prepared as described by Saito and Miura (24Saito H. Miura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 72: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). Partial digestion of the chromosomal DNA (72 μg) was carried out with Sau3AI (128 units). DNA fragments 4–8 kilobases long were extracted from 0.8% agarose gel after electrophoresis. The DNA fragments were ligated into theBamHI site of pUC119 with T4 DNA ligase, and the ligation mixture was used directly for transformation of E. coliJM109 to construct a genomic DNA library of M. luteus B-P 26. An appropriate amount of E. coli cells carrying the genomic DNA library was inoculated (4,000 colonies/plate) on a nylon membrane (0.2-μm grid of the mesh Biodyne A, 132-mm diameter) that had been laid on an LB-agar plate containing ampicillin. After incubation at 37 °C for 14 h, two replica filters were made by filter-to-filter contact. The replica filters were incubated for another 7 h on new LB-agar plates containing ampicillin. Then, UPS activity was screened over the library by the colony autoradiography method as described above using FPP or Z-GGPP as a primer substrate. In this case, the total volume of the reaction mixtures was increased to 1.6 ml adjusting to the size of the filter. After seeking the coincident spots in the autoradiograms of the duplicate filter, double-positive clones were isolated from the master plate and analyzed further. Transformed E. coli cells were cultured in 2 ml of LB broth at 37 °C overnight. The cells were harvested, resuspended in 0.3 ml of TE buffer, and homogenized by sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was examined for prenyltransferase activity. The incubation mixture contained, in a final volume of 0.2 ml, 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 μm FPP or Z-GGPP, 0.46 μm[1-14C]IPP, 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100 (for UPS assay), and crude cell-free homogenate (1 μg of protein) of an E. coli transformant to be examined. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then treated with 1-butanol to extract the product of the prenyltransferase reaction. The radioactivity in the butanol extract was measured with an Aloka LSC-1000 liquid scintillation counter. After incubation, the radioactive prenyl diphosphates in the reaction mixture were hydrolyzed to the corresponding alcohols with potato acid phosphatase according to our method reported previously (25Fujii H.

The alcohols were extracted with pentane and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on a reversed phase LKC-18 plate (Whatman) with a solvent system of acetone/water (19:1). Normal phase TLC of the radioactive prenyl diphosphate products was also carried out on a Silica Gel G-60 plate (Merck) with a solvent system of 1-propanol, 29% aqueous NH3, H2O (6:3:1). The positions of authentic standards were visualized with iodine vapor, and the distribution of radioactivity was determined by autoradiography with a bioimaging analyzer. All DNA sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method with a DNA sequencer (LI-COR model 4000L). Computer analysis and comparison of DNA sequences were performed using GENETYX genetic information processing software (Software Development). The UPS gene sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from M. luteus B-P 26 genomic DNA, using the primers 5′-GAGGTTGACATGTTTCCAATTAA-3′ and 5′-CATGATTTAAAGCTTATAATCCACC-3′. These primers were designed so that the amplified DNA would contain the restriction endonuclease sites for AflIII andHindIII at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were digested with AflIII and HindIII, purified, and ligated into the pET22b expression vector. The resultant vector, designated as pET22bMLU, was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The UPS gene was fused to the pelB signal sequence so that the translated protein could be secreted to the periplasmic region followed by removal of the signal peptide by endogenous signal peptidase. Recombinant clone was selected for the UPS gene insert, and a single colony was grown in 3 ml of LB medium for 9 h. The resulting culture was inoculated into 2 liters of M9-glucose (1 mg of thiamine, 120 mg of MgSO4, 11 mg of CaCl2, and 2 g of glucose in 1 × M9 salts (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar)) plus ampicillin (50 mg/liter) and grown at 37 °C. The cell growth was monitored and induced with 1.0 mm IPTG when cells reached 0.3 absorbance unit at 600 nm. The cells were grown for another 26 h and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets (3 g, wet weight) of BL21(DE3)/pET22bMLU were suspended in 30 ml of TE buffer and disrupted by sonication (Fraction I). The extracts from the cells were collected by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant (Fraction II) was subjected to further purification. The protein fraction precipitated from the 100,000 × g supernatant by 30–60% saturation with ammonium sulfate was dissolved in 30 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3 (buffer A) (Fraction III). Then the UPS solution was applied to a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted at 1 ml/min with a stepwise gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. The UPS fractions (Fraction IV) after Mono Q chromatography were subjected to gel filtration performed with Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 0.4 ml/min with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl (buffer P). All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Protein elution was monitored by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. The 30-kDa protein (30 μg) purified by Mono Q chromatography was developed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and then electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The transferred polypeptide was visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue and sequenced using the HP G1005A protein sequencing system. To examine the possibility of selective labeling of E. coli cells that produce recombinant prenyltransferase, we incubated intact colonies on a nylon membrane with radiolabeled substrates. Three recombinant clones, JM109/pFP00 producing FPS of M. luteus B-P 26 (24Saito H. Miura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 72: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar), JM109/pHX06 producing HexPS of M. luteus B-P 26 (21Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and JM109/pUC119 as a control, were streaked separately on a nylon membrane placed on an agar plate. Six replica filters were prepared and were subjected to prenyltransferase activity assays by the colony autoradiography method with three different sets of substrates. If nonspecific adsorption or absorption of radioactive IPP by E. coli cells or by the membrane filter had occurred primarily, all of the colonies should have given nonselective signals, or the background level should have been high in the autoradiogram. In fact, however, the clone expressing a certain level of prenyltransferase was labeled selectively enough to give distinct signals in the autoradiograms after incubation with radiolabeled substrates (Fig.1). It was thus found to be possible to discriminate the three kinds of clones by colony autoradiography. When the Mg2+ concentration in the incubation mixture was 0.5 mm (Conditions II, Fig. 1, a–c), specific selection of JM109/pHX06, which expresses HexPS, was successful when assayed with the mixture containing FPP as the priming substrate (Fig.1 c). No colony was labeled when [1-14C]IPP was employed as the sole substrate (Fig. 1 a). The colonies expressing FPS, JM109/pFP00, could not be detected clearly with its substrate DMAPP as the allylic primer (Fig. 1 b). However, strong signals were obtained from the colonies of JM109/pFP00 with DMAPP (Fig. 1 e), when the Mg2+ concentration as raised to 5 mm (Conditions I; Fig. 1, d–f). This is consistent with the observation that FPS requires a higher Mg2+ concentration than HexPS (26Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In this case, discrimination between JM109/pUC119 and JM109/pFP00 was possible, but JM109/pHX06, which should not utilize DMAPP as a primer, also gave strong signals (Fig. 1 e). This was probably because of a low but significant activity of the host FPS, which could produce FPP acceptable as substrate for HexPS under these conditions. The case was similar with JM109/pFP00 (Fig. 1 d). The JM109/pFP00 colonies were visualized under the conditions where [1-14C]IPP was the only substrate, probably because of the production of DMAPP by the action of IPP isomerase of the host cells. Even with such an undesirable background of prenyltransferase activity by the host cells, this assay method appears promising for screening a clone expressing a prenyltransferase if the specific assay conditions are chosen properly . We first applied this method to screening a transformant expressing UPS of M. luteus B-P 26. Based on the fact that the UPS activity can be detected by using FPP as the allylic primer substrate and that the optimum concentration of Mg2+ for UPS is lower than for FPS (27Koyama T. Yoshida I. Ogura K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1988; 103: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it is possible to set proper screening conditions for UPS. Furthermore, because UPS can utilize Z-GGPP as a primer, which cannot be a substrate for HexPS (26Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 28Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14610-14612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may be possible to identify the clone expressing UPS among the positive clones under the assay conditions using FPP as the priming substrate. With this expectation, about 4,000 transformants ofE. coli cells carrying a genomic DNA library of M. luteus B-P 26 were screened by this filter assay method, using Conditions II with FPP or Z-GGPP as the priming substrate (Fig. 2). As a result, we could obtain four positive colonies coinciding in the two assay systems using different priming substrates. Then the four clones were isolated from the master plate, and the prenyltransferase activities in the cell-free homogenates of the clones were examined precisely as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Table I, all of the four clones expressed significant levels of prenyltransferase activities when assayed with FPP as the primer, and two of them showed significant activities when Z-GGPP was the allylic substrate. TLC analyses of the butanol-extractable polyprenyl products and the corresponding alcohols obtained by phosphatase treatment clearly indicated that the two clones produced UPP and that the rest of them produced HexPP. Hence, we assigned the former two clones as transformants with plasmids carrying the UPS gene of M. luteus B-P 26 and the latter two as those carrying the genes for the two essential components of HexPS of the same bacterium, which we have cloned recently (21Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two clones expressing the UPS activity were found to carry plasmids of different insert size with overlapping fragment, and the smaller one, containing a 6-kilobase insert, was designated as pSU29S2 and was subjected to deletion experiments and sequence determination.Table IPrenyltransferase activities of the clones selected by the direct filter assaySelected clonesAllylic primer substrateDMAPPFPPZ-GGPPdpmdpmdpmJM109/pUC119480510730JM109/pSU264502,0402,040JM109/pSU275003,080790JM109/pSU285802,600630JM109/pSU29S25602,8302,930Each of the cell-free homogenates of the four double-positive clones, JM109/pSU26, -/pSU27, -/pSU28, and -/pSU29S2, obtained by means of colony autoradiography, was examined for the prenyltransferase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Radioactivities obtained under three different sets of assay conditions using DMAPP, FPP, or Z-GGPP as the priming substrate are shown.

JM109/pUC119 was assayed as a control. Deletion experiments of pSU29S2 indicated that the DNA sequence responsible for the UPS activity was located within a 1-kilobase DNA region. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the region revealed the presence of one open reading frame of 750 base pairs. The deduced amino acid sequence of the UPS is shown in Fig. 3 with its nucleotide sequence. The primary structure of the UPS of M. luteus B-P 26 is totally different from those of the prenyltransferases (prenyl diphosphate synthases) forE-prenyl chain elongation (1Ogura K. Koyama T. Ogura K. Sankawa U. Dynamic Aspects of Natural Products Chemistry: Molecular Biological Approaches. Kodansha Ltd., Tokyo1997: 1-23Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the induction products in the whole cell lysate of theE. coli cells harboring pET22bMLU, pET22b containing the UPS gene, showed the existence of two protein forms with slightly different molecular masses of 30 and 31 kDa (Fig.4, lane 2). After ultracentrifugation, the 30-kDa protein product was found in the soluble fraction (Fig. 4, lane 4), and the 31-kDa protein remained in the pellet fraction (Fig. 4, lane 3). The pellet fraction showed the UPS activity as well as the soluble fraction (data not shown). The UPS in the soluble fraction was readily purified to near homogeneity through ammonium sulfate precipitation and two chromatographic steps, which are summarized in TableII. Hydrophobic chromatography was not suitable for the purification of this enzyme because it was easily absorbed by butyl-, octyl-, and phenyl-Sepharose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted very broadly during decreasing linear gradient of ammonium sulfate. The ammonium sulfate precipitate fraction was applied to a Mono Q column, from which the UPS was eluted by 100 mm NaCl. As shown in Fig. 4, the UPS fraction after Mono Q chromatography gave a protein band at 30 kDa (lane 6). However, after storage at 4 °C for a week, the protein migrated at a molecular size of 29 kDa (lane 7). After gel filtration with Superdex 200, the purity of the enzyme appeared to be better than 95% (Fig. 4, lane 8).Table IIPurification of recombinant M. luteus B-P 26 UPSFractionTotal proteinaDetermined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Specific activitybRepresented as nmol of IPP incorporated/mg of protein/min.

Amino-terminal sequencing was performed to verify that the 30-kDa protein after Mono Q chromatography was that encoded by the pET22bMLU vector. As a result, the sequence of 20 amino acids from the amino terminus was AQPAMAMFPIKKRKAIKNNN, indicating that 6 residues from the amino terminus (AQPAMA) was the remainder of the pelBsignal sequence which resulted from the cleavage at an unexpected position. The sequence MFPIKKRKAIKNNN was in complete agreement with that predicted from the DNA sequence of the UPS. Fig. 5 shows radiochromatographic analyses of reaction products of the purified UPS from BL21(DE3)/pET22bMLU when FPP was used as the allylic primer substrate. The major prenol obtained after phosphatase treatment had the same mobility as authentic undecaprenol (C55OH) on reversed phase TLC (panel A, lane 4). Small amounts of intermediate products with chain lengths of C20-C50 were also observed. WhenZ-GGPP was used as the allylic primer, the TLC patterns were almost similar to those of lane 4, except that the intermediate products with chain length of C20 were not observed (data not shown). On normal phase TLC (panel B,lane 4), the major product had a largerRF value (0.48) than those of HexPP (0.42,lane 2) and FPP (0.37, lane 1), showing that it was UPP. Although the reaction catalyzed by UPS is similar to those ofE-type prenyl chain-elongating enzymes, we have never found a candidate gene for the Z-type prenyltransferase by searching the whole genome sequence data base of E. coli on the assumption that Z-prenyltransferases also have some homologies to the E-prenyltransferases whose genes are already cloned (29Fujisaki S. Hara H. Nishimura Y. Horiuchi K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1990; 108: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Asai K. Fujisaki S. Nishimura Y. Nishino T. Okada K. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We therefore planned shotgun screening of theM. luteus B-P 26 genomic DNA library for expression of prenyltransferase activities. To screen as many clones as possible simultaneously, we conducted the colony autoradiography method originally developed by Raetz for the selection of mutants defective in specific enzymes (23Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2274-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Replica filters of M. luteus B-P 26 genomic DNA library were incubated with the substrates for prenyltransferases, and enzymatic activities were screened directly on the intact colonies. The lipid bilayers of E. coli cells were thought to be impermeable to charged molecules such as IPP and FPP. However, Takatsuji et al. (31Takatsuji H. Nishino T. Miki I. Katsuki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 110: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and Fujisaki et al. (32Fujisaki S. Nishino T. Izui K. Katsuki H. Biochem. Int. 1984; 8: 779-785PubMed Google Scholar) reported that 14C-labeled IPP was incorporated into isoprenoid compounds in the presence of Mg2+ ions when incubated with Arthrobacter or lyophilized E. coli cells. This observation suggests thatE. coli cells are permeable to IPP in the presence of Mg2+. Therefore, we expected that both14C-labeled IPP and allylic diphosphates would permeate the cells and that the E. coli transformants overexpressing prenyltransferases could utilize them to yield radioactive products in the cells in amounts large enough to detect by autoradiography. Thus, we were able to set up proper conditions for screening the UPS activity and succeeded in cloning the UPS gene. Our first attempt to overproduce the recombinant UPS in an active form in E. coli cells failed. We ascribed the failure to the overproduction and accumulation of UPP, which might disrupt the metabolic pathway because UPP is involved in cell wall biosynthesis of the host bacterium. Then, we introduced the bacterial pelBsignal sequence to the amino terminus of the UPS to localize the protein product in the periplasmic space so that interference in the host growth could be avoided. The expression of the protein was controlled by a T7 RNA polymerase-mediated system in a recombinant strain of E. coli BL21(DE3). Two major protein bands were detected on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the whole cell lysate of transformants after treatment with IPTG. Because the 31-kDa protein was detectable only in the insoluble pellet fraction, this may be attributable to the products with unprocessedpelB leader sequence encoded by the pET22b vector, which tends to associate with the membrane fraction. Sequence analysis of the 30-kDa protein product obtained in the Mono Q chromatography indicated that part of the signal sequence was left at the amino terminus of the recombinant enzyme. A signal peptidase remaining in the UPS fraction after Mono Q chromatography might have processed the residual peptide properly while kept at 4 °C for a week. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified UPS shows a single band at 29 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 8), which is consistent with the molecular weight of 28,876 calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence. Because all of the three protein species, 31-, 30-, and 29 kDa proteins, showed considerable UPS activity, it is likely that flanking amino-terminal sequence does not affect the catalytic activity. The purified protein itself had the UPS activity, showing almost the same specific activity as reported by Muth and Allen (19Muth J.D. Allen C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) for an extensively purified specimen of UPS of Lactobacillus plantarum. This indicates that the 29-kDa protein overproduced is actually UPS and not an accessory protein that stimulates the endogenous UPS. Thus it was confirmed that the gene for theZ-prenyltransferase was first cloned and overproduced. The E-prenyltransferases so far known have several characteristic regions well conserved regardless of the chain length of the product. The regions include two DDXXD motifs that are important for both catalytic function and substrate binding (7Joly A. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26983-26989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Song L. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 15018-15023Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It is also shown that prenyl diphosphate is bound to one of the conserved DDXXD motifs through a magnesium bridge (15Tarshis L.C. Proteau P.J. Kellogg B.A. Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15018-15023Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). TheZ- and E-prenyltransferases are similar in that they both catalyze sequential condensations between IPP and allylic diphosphates with concomitant release of inorganic pyrophosphate in the presence of magnesium ions. In view of this similarity, it was expected that a considerable extent of sequence similarity would be found between the Z- and E-prenyltransferases. Surprisingly, however, no similarity was found between them. There is a DDXXD-like motif structure in residues 117–121 in the UPS, but the significance of this structure remains to be explored. It is assumed that the E-farnesyl-Z-octaprenyl (undecaprenyl) moiety and the E-prenyl side chain of menaquinone are early ancestors of a variety of isoprenoid compounds because undecaprenyl phosphate and menaquinone play essential roles in cell wall construction and membrane-associated bioenergetics, respectively, in prokaryotes. Thus, the Z- andE-prenyltransferases responsible for these two isoprenoid moieties might have evolved independently. Our search through protein data bases for amino acid sequences similar to that of UPS revealed several as yet unidentified proteins, including eukaryotic proteins. The identification of these proteins will be of interest from an evolutional aspect. It is also interesting to learn the similarity and difference in the three-dimensional structures of these two types of prenyltransferases. The stereochemical courses of Z- andE-prenyltransferase reactions are similar to each other in that in both cases the C-C bond is formed on the same side of IPP as the C-H bond that is cleaved (33Ito M. Kobayashi M. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4745-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This suggests that the conformation of the IPP molecule bound in the active site of theZ-prenyltransferase must be different from that in the case of the E-prenyltransferases. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism of the UPS reaction will provide a practical strategy for designing of new antimicrobial molecules."

To test proliferative functions of E2F, we generated transgenic mice expressing human E2F-1 and/or human DP-1. When the hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase promoter was used to express DP-1, overexpression occurred in a variety of tissues and did not confer phenotypic changes. In contrast, expression of E2F-1 from the same promoter was obtained only in testicles, in which E2F-1 overexpression caused atrophy and sterility through a process involving increased apoptosis in the germinal epithelium. This effect was potentiated by simultaneous overexpression of DP-1. Testicular atrophy as a result of overexpression of E2F-1 and DP-1 is independent of functional p53, since p53-nullizygous transgenic mice overexpressing E2F-1 and DP-1 also suffered testicular atrophy."

Folding rate could predominate, if folded protein rapidly escapes from the proofreading apparatus by exiting the ER promptly upon achieving a folded conformation. Alternatively, thermodynamic folding stability could determine secretion efficiency by defining a rapidly equilibrated partition between conformations subject to two irreversible processes: degradation of the unfolded form versus export of the folded form. Yet another possibility is that the varying strength of currently ill-defined ER export signals affects ER residence time (16Kuehn M.J. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), hence exposing proteins to potential retention and degradation for varying lengths of time. In all likelihood, each of these properties influences secretion efficiency to some extent, with particular attributes accentuated for particular proteins. It was recently shown that secretion efficiency in yeast for bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor mutants lacking disulfide bonds is correlated with thermodynamic stability but not with reported in vitro folding rates (17Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because removal of cysteines by site-directed mutagenesis qualitatively alters the oxidative folding pathway, the linkage between stability and secretion efficiency was tested further in the present study by examining six point mutants of BPTI that destabilize the surface 14–38 disulfide (18Goldenberg D.P. Bekeart L.S. Laheru D.A. Zhou J.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For these mutants, secretion efficiency is strongly correlated with the destabilization free energy of the 14–38 disulfide but is not predicted by in vitro folding or unfolding rates. These results support a model for BPTI quality control in which a variable fraction of the protein is degraded while the folded form awaits export from the ER, implying that folding of even relatively stable proteins is functionally reversible in the ER. Cultures of S. cerevisiae strain BJ5464 (α ura3–52 trp1 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 pep4::HIS3 prb1Δ1.6R can1 GAL) were obtained from the Yeast Genetic Stock Center (Berkeley, CA). BJ5464 is deficient in vacuolar proteases, reducing proteolytic artifacts during cell extract preparation (19Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Strain YVH10 for overexpression of PDI was derived from the parent strain BJ5464 (20Robinson A.S. Hines V. Wittrup K.D. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It contains an integrated copy of the yeast PDI gene under control of the constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter, resulting in 15-fold overexpression of yeast PDI. Strains W303-BD (MATαder1::URA3 ura3–1 his3–11,15 leu2–3, 112 trp1–1 ade2–1 oc can1–100), W303-CQ (MATα prc1–1 ubc7::LEU2 ura3–1 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 ade2–1 oc can1–100), and W303–1b (MATα ura3–1 his3–11,15 leu2–3, 112 trp1–1 ade2–1 oc can1–100) were gifts of D. Wolf. All yeast transformations were performed by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser (21Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on minimal medium containing casamino acid supplement (SD-CAA + uracil) buffered with sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.0) (22Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Independent transformant colonies were grown in culture tubes with 5 ml of liquid SD-CAA + uracil media for 96 h prior to measurement of BPTI secretion. The plasmid used to express EA-BPTI in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was constructed by subcloning the expression cassette from the vector pUC-G-BPTI (23Parekh R. Forrester K. Wittrup D. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) into the multicopy yeast shuttle vector YEplac112 (24Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar) as anEcoRI-BamHI fragment. The resulting plasmid is referred to as YE112-GPD-BPTI. BPTI is expressed using the constitutive yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. A synthetic preproleader is used to target BPTI to the ER (23Parekh R. Forrester K. Wittrup D. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The proregion contains a dibasic Lys-Arg site at its C terminus to allow cleavage by the Kex2p protease. This results in a Glu-Ala extension at the N terminus of the secreted, mature BPTI. The construction of the C14/38A BPTI plasmid has been described previously (17Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This plasmid is referred to as YE112-GPD-BPTI-C14/38A. Mutations to YE112-GPD-BPTI and YE112-GPD-BPTI-C14/38A plasmids were introduced using an oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis kit (Morph site-specific plasmid DNA mutagenesis kit, 5 Prime–3 Prime, Inc.). Each oligonucleotide introduced the indicated amino acid change as well as a silent mutation that introduced a restriction site to aid in screening of the mutant colonies. The following oligonucleotides were used for each mutant: Y35F, CCTTCGTTTTCGGTGGTTGTAGGGCTAAGCGAAACAAC; P13S, GGAACCACCGTATACGGGCTCTTGTAAGGC; G37A, CCTTCGTTTACGGTGCTTGTAGGGCTAAGCGAAACAAC; A16V, GGAACCACCGTATACGGGCCCATGTAAGGTTAGAATTATCAG; G36D, GGCTGGTTTGTGTCAAACGTTCGTTTACGATGGTTGTAGGGC; Y35L, CAAGGCAGGCCTATGTCAAACCTTCGTTTTGGGTGGTTGTAGGGCTAAGAGAAACAACTTCAAGTCCGC; P13S, C14/38A, GGAACCACCGTATACGGGCTCAGCTAAGGC; Y35L, C14/38A, CAAACCTTCGTCCTAGGTGGTGCACG. The various mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis (Automated Applied Biosystems Sequencer, University of Illinois UC Genetic Engineering Facility). Plasmid manipulations were carried out according to standard procedures (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The level of BPTI secreted in the supernatant was measured as described (23Parekh R. Forrester K. Wittrup D. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transformants were grown in selective growth medium (SD-CAA + uracil) in 5-ml test tube cultures for 96 h to anA600 of approximately 10.0. SaturatedA600 did not vary with expression of different mutants, and quintuplicate replicates varied less than 5% inA600. Increase in intensity ofl-BAPA (Sigma), a synthetic trypsin substrate, at 405 nm was used to measure trypsin activity. A standard curve was obtained for a given level of trypsin (36 mg) and varying amounts of standard native BPTI (0–10 mg) obtained from Worthington Biochemicals. Trypsin inhibition obtained with the supernatant was compared with the standard curve to estimate the level of BPTI present in the culture. Since BPTI-trypsin binding is effectively irreversible, BPTI activity is equal to the difference between the added and detected trypsin activities. For metabolic labeling of cells, an exponentially growing culture of BJ5464 in selective minimal media was used. The cells were transformed with either the expression plasmid plasmids for WT, P13S, or Y35L BPTI. The cell cultures were switched to minimal media lacking methionine 2 h before labeling. Cells were pulsed with 50 mCi ofl-[35S]methionine (Redivue, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per 1 A600 units of cells for 1 min. For the chase, methionine was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. Intracellular samples were taken immediately following the addition of unlabeled methionine to determine initial BPTI synthesis. Supernatant samples were taken for times between 0 min and 2 h to record the appearance of secreted BPTI. During labeling and chase periods, the cells were incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 14,000 rpm using an Eppendorf Thermomixer. For the intracellular samples, one A600 unit was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 s. The supernatant was removed and 100 μl of ice-cold stop buffer was rapidly mixed with the pellet (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm ammonium acetate, 500 mm iodoacetamide, 20 mm sodium azide, 0.45 mm cycloheximide, 5 mm EDTA). The sample was then frozen in a dry ice ethanol bath. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (26Robinson A.S. Bockhaus J.A. Voegler A.C. Wittrup K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10017-10022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Triplicate samples were thawed by addition of ice-cold cell extract buffer and vortexing (final concentrations: 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm ammonium acetate, 500 mm iodoacetamide, 20 mm sodium azide, 0.45 mm cycloheximide, 20 mm EDTA, 10% trichloroacetic acid, 4 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 3 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml antipain). This suspension was transferred to a tube containing 600 μl of zirconium oxide beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK). The cells were mechanically lysed by two 50-s cycles in a Bead-Beater (BioSpec Products) with cooling on wet ice between cycles. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the beads were washed twice with 500 ml of wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm ammonium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 10% trichloroacetic acid). The washes were combined with the original supernatant, and the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of trichloroacetic acid resuspension buffer (3% SDS, 100 mmTris (pH 11), 10 mm dithiothreitol) and boiled for 5 min. After boiling, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 50 mm, then 160 μl of dilution buffer was added (60 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 190 mm NaCl, 6 mmEDTA, 1.25% Triton X-100). Ten μl of Omnisorb (CalBiochem) was added, and the mixture was incubated with rotation for 10 min. This mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was prepared for electrophoresis. In control immunoprecipitations, the bands corresponding to intracellular and secreted BPTI were identified. Immunoprecipitation was not necessary for the quantitation presented here because no abundant cellular proteins were present in the molecular weight range of BPTI and pro-BPTI. Supernatant samples were concentrated 10-fold in a Microcon-3 concentrator (Amicon) and prepared for electrophoresis. The sample was mixed with an equal volume of 2× Tricine sample buffer (Novex, San Diego, CA) with dithiothreitol added to a final concentration of 65 mm and boiled for 5 min. This mixture was then loaded onto a 10–20% gradient Tricine gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) and was electrophoresed at 125 V for 90 min using Tricine running buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm Tricine, 0.05% SDS, pH 8.3). The gel was placed on 3 MM Whatman paper and covered with plastic wrap. The gel was then dried on a gel dryer (Hoeffer) for 2 h at 80 °C and allowed to cool for 30 min under vacuum only. The dried gel was placed in a PhosphorImager exposure cassette (Molecular Dynamics) for 24–72 h. The cassette was scanned and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software. A series of point mutations that destabilize the 14–38 disulfide of BPTI by 0.6–3.7 kcal/mol (18Goldenberg D.P. Bekeart L.S. Laheru D.A. Zhou J.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were selected for examination of secretion efficiency from yeast. These mutations were introduced into a yeast expression and secretion vector for BPTI (23Parekh R. Forrester K. Wittrup D. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and BPTI secretion levels were determined (Table I.) The observed variation in secreted BPTI was not because of variable stability in the culture medium because secreted BPTI mutant activities were stable for at least one week in the growth culture under these experimental conditions, in the presence or absence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as a carrier protein.Table ISecretion levels of BPTI and mutants (expressed in mg/liter)Form of BPTI expressedBJ5464 (wild-type yeast)YVH10 (BJ5464 w/PDI overexpression)W303–1b (wild-type isogenic to BD and CQ)W303-BD ΔDER1W303-CQ ΔUBC7WT BPTI23.6 ± 1.47.5 ± 0.924.0 ± 0.512.6 ± 9.213.7 ± 6.6Y35F18.8 ± 0.46.3 ± 0.1NDNDNDP13S11.6 ± 1.24.0 ± 0.314.1 ± 0.613.2 ± 1.211.3 ± 1.0G37A9.3 ± 1.54.2 ± 0.5NDNDNDA16V12.7 ± 1.34.8 ± 0.6NDNDNDG36D10.4 ± 0.5NDNDNDNDY35L1.9 ± 1.630.9 ± 0.58.3 ± 0.57.0 ± 0.46.3 ± 0.5C14/38A19.1 ± 0.4NDNDNDNDP13S + C14/38A8.1 ± 0.62.5 ± 0.3NDNDNDY35L + C14/38A2.1 ± 0.50.4 ± 0.6NDNDNDND, not determined; S. cerevisiae strain genotypes provided under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab ND, not determined; S. cerevisiae strain genotypes provided under “Experimental Procedures.” To confirm that the observed variation in secreted BPTI levels is attributable to variable secretion efficiency, pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments were performed for WT and two mutant forms of BPTI. Yeast cultures expressing wild-type BPTI, P13S BPTI, or Y35L BPTI were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 min, with a chase period initiated by addition of 10 mm unlabeled methionine. During the pulse labeling period, equivalent quantities of radiolabeled BPTI were accumulated intracellularly for each construct as a percentage of total protein: 1.4 ± 0.3% for wild-type BPTI, 1.2 ± 0.3% for P13S BPTI, and 1.4 ± 0.3% for Y35L BPTI. This result indicates an absence of substantial variation in pre-ER processes such as plasmid stability, transcription, translation, or ER membrane translocation. These percentages are in quantitative agreement with earlier measurements for C14/38A, C30/51A, and C5/55A BPTI in the same expression system under the same experimental conditions (17Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The rate of appearance of radiolabeled BPTI in the culture supernatant is shown in Fig. 1. Two h following the radiolabeling pulse, levels of secreted radiolabeled P13S and Y35L BPTI relative to wild-type BPTI parallel total secretion levels in Table I. Wild-type BPTI continues to accumulate in the medium 30 min following the radiolabeling pulse, whereas the less stable mutant P13S BPTI reaches its maximum secretion level within 30 min. Similar secretion kinetics were observed previously for wild-type BPTI relative to the destabilized mutants C14/38A and C30/51A BPTI (17Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), with the less stable mutants ceasing accumulation in the medium by 1 h of chase time, while WT BPTI continues to accumulate. Secretion levels are strongly correlated with the reported extent of destabilization of the 14–38 disulfide (Fig.2). Secretion efficiency is not predicted by the in vitro reduction rates because G36D BPTI actually displays a slower in vitro reduction rate for the 14–38 disulfide (18Goldenberg D.P. Bekeart L.S. Laheru D.A. Zhou J.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) yet is secreted less efficiently than WT BPTI, while each of the other five mutants have faster reduction rates than WT BPTI. Secretion efficiency is also not predicted by the in vitro oxidative folding rate because Y35L BPTI has been shown to fold an order of magnitude faster than wild-type BPTI in vitro (27Zhang J.X. Goldenberg D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14075-14081Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The correlation between thermodynamic stability and secretion shown in Fig. 2, together with the absence of such a correlation with in vitro oxidative folding or reduction rate, supports the hypothesis that a pseudo-steady-state equilibration between the folded and unfolded states determines the efficiency of escape from the ER quality control system for this series of BPTI mutants. Removal of cysteines 14 and 38 by mutagenesis indicates that folding instability rather than destabilization of the 14–38 disulfide per seis responsible for reduced secretion efficiency. Following reduction of the 14–38 disulfide, BPTI unfolding can proceed both by intramolecular attack on the buried 30–51 or 5–55 disulfides by the newly liberated cysteine 14 or 38 thiols, or by intermolecular attack of the buried 30–51 and 5–55 disulfides by a reducing agent (28Mendoza J.A. Jarstfer M.B. Goldenberg D.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine whether an increased presence of free cysteine 14 and 38 thiols is responsible for the observed reduction in secretion efficiency of P13S and Y35L BPTI, we introduced the C14/38A mutations into these expression constructs. If the intramolecular rearrangement pathway were primarily responsible for misfolding, retention, and degradation of P13S and Y35L BPTI, then removal of cysteines 14 and 38 should produce a marked stabilization of these forms, leading to increased secretion efficiency. This is not the case, as indicated in Table I and Fig.3. Loss of the 14–38 disulfide reduces secretion of wild-type, P13S, and Y35L BPTI by similar proportions. These results indicate that destabilization of the folded conformation rather than the increased presence of Cys-14 and Cys-38 thiols is primarily responsible for reduced secretion. As discussed in further detail below, thermodynamic linkage between disulfide redox equilibria and folding stability have been established previously for other mutants of BPTI, DsbA, and thioredoxin. Overexpression of PDI in yeast can increase secretion of some proteins by as much as an order of magnitude (20Robinson A.S. Hines V. Wittrup K.D. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar,29Schultz L. Markus H. Hofmann K. Montgomery D. Dunwiddie C. Kniskern P. Freedman R. Ellis R. Tuite M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 721: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), yet overexpression of PDI reduces secretion of BPTI (Ref. 17Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Table I, Fig. 4). If either oxidative folding or reductive unfolding rates alone determined the efficiency of quality control escape for these BPTI mutants, then increased PDI levels might be expected to exert differential effects among the mutants. However, PDI overexpression reduces secretion of wild-type, Y35F, P13S, A16V, G37A, Y35L, P13S + C14/38A, Y35L + C14/38A BPTI proportionally (Fig. 4.) The correlation of secretion efficiency with thermodynamic stability therefore persists under substantially altered conditions for redox folding catalysis in the ER. Of course, a redox folding catalyst such as PDI accelerates the oxidative folding and unfolding kinetics of a protein without altering its underlying thermodynamic stability. The mechanism for reduced BPTI secretion upon PDI overexpression is not clear, particularly given the beneficial effects of PDI overexpression for platelet-derived growth factor,Schizosaccharomyces pombe acid phosphatase, and antistasin (20Robinson A.S. Hines V. Wittrup K.D. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 29Schultz L. Markus H. Hofmann K. Montgomery D. Dunwiddie C. Kniskern P. Freedman R. Ellis R. Tuite M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 721: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 2J. M. Kowalski, R. N. Parekh, J. Mao, K. D. Wittrup, manuscript in preparation. One possible explanation is the “antichaperone” activity of PDI (30Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has also been invoked to explain negative effects of mutant PDI expression on antibody secretion in insect cells (31Whiteley E.M. Hsu T.-A. Betenbaugh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22556-22563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because the extent of retention and proteolysis of unfolded protein determines secretion efficiency (Fig. 1), one might expect that loss of key components of the degradation pathway might increase secretion efficiency. This was not found to be the case however (Fig. 5.) Secretion of wild-type, P13S, and Y35L BPTI was unaffected by loss of function of theDER1 and UBC7 genes, which are required for efficient ER-associated degradation (32Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 33Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Thus, BPTI secretion efficiency is not increased in the absence of a fully functional ER-associated degradation apparatus. It is interesting that greater clonal variation of WT BPTI secretion occurred in the ER degradation-deficient mutant strains; this is because of the presence of several cultures in which secretion dropped precipitously to ≈ 5 mg/liter. Such variation was not observed for P13S or Y35L BPTI secretion in these strains. The data presented here supports a model for ER quality control whereby thermodynamic stability can determine the efficiency of escape from retention and degradation. Such a correlation was also observed for mutants of BPTI with cysteine/alanine replacements (17Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A kinetic model for this pathway is represented schematically in Fig.6. If folded protein were promptly exported from the ER by vesicular transport, one would expect secretion efficiency to be determined chiefly by the rate of folding. However, BPTI mutants that fold more rapidly than wild-type in vitro(Y35L and C30/51A BPTI) are secreted less efficiently than wild-type (Table I, Fig. 2; Ref. 17Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ER export rate for folded protein is determined by an ill-characterized process of protein cargo concentration into vesicles budding from the ER membrane (16Kuehn M.J. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The nature of the required export signals and possible cargo receptors for soluble proteins are still uncertain, although Emp24p is a candidate yeast cargo receptor for some proteins (34Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Schroder S. Kruger U. Barlowe C. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 35Elrod-Erickson M.J. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1043-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). If a protein folds rapidly but is delayed in export from the ER because of slow or inefficient cargo loading into transport vesicles, then a greater fraction of protein may be unfolded and degraded while awaiting export. Consistent with this scenario, the half-time for appearance of WT BPTI in the growth medium is approximately 30 min (Fig. 1) whereas the half time for folding, as assayed by binding to trypsin-Sepharose, is 2–5 min.2 BPTI therefore persists intracellularly with a half time of approximately 30 min following completion of folding, during which time it may be partially unfolded, retained, and degraded, with the extent of such losses correlated with stability. Retention and degradation are represented as separable processes in Fig. 6 because loss of components of the degradation pathway (Der1p and Ubc7p) does not shift the balance toward secretion (Fig. 5). ER retention could result either from physical binding to an ER-resident component of the quality control apparatus or exclusion from export vesicles. A constant fraction of WT, P13S, and Y35L BPTI are retained by the quality control apparatus even in the absence of a degradation sink for the retained material (Fig. 5), indicating that any retention receptors are not saturable at this level of multicopy expression. Calnexin has been shown to serve as a retention receptor for glycosylated proteins; however, BPTI is not glycosylated. Furthermore, deletion of the yeast calnexin homolog CNE1 does not increase the secretion efficiency of wild-type, P13S, or Y35L BPTI (data not shown). The identity of a quality control receptor responsible for BPTI retention has not been determined. It should be emphasized that although secretion is correlated with thermodynamic stability, true equilibrium between the folded and unfolded forms cannot exist in the ER because of the presence of irreversible rate processes: degradation and ER export. Rather, a pseudo-steady-state partition between folded and unfolded proteins is attained. Of course, if the rates of degradation and export are much slower than the rates of folding and unfolding, then the pseudo-steady-state ratio of folded to unfolded protein could closely approximate the equilibrium value. Given wild-type BPTI's extreme stability (Tm = 105 °C, Ref. 36Moses E. Hinz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), even the 3.7 kcal/mol of 14–38 disulfide destabilization produced by the Y35L mutation should yield a protein that is mostly folded at equilibrium at 30 °C. The precipitous drop in secretion efficiency for Y35L BPTI would be difficult to explain strictly on the basis of the small fraction of unfolded protein at equilibrium in vitro. However, the presence of high concentrations of protein folding chaperones such as BiP and PDI in the ER are likely to shift the folding equilibrium toward the unfolded state by Le Châtelier's principle, stabilizing partially unfolded conformers through chaperone binding free energy. Chaperones as structurally and functionally diverse as GroEL and SecB have been shown to catalyze deuterium exchange with normally protected amide protons in folded proteins (37Zahn R. Perrett S. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 38Zahn R. Perrett S. Stenberg G. Fersht A.R. Science. 1996; 271: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Such “unfoldase” activity would be strongly present in the ER lumen given the high concentration of protein folding chaperones in this organelle. Therefore, the unfolded protein fraction vulnerable to retention and degradation would be expected to be larger than the equilibrium unfolded fraction in vitro. There are several precedents for thermodynamic stability determining the half-life of proteins in vivo. Mutants of the bacteriophage λ cro protein with varying stability exhibit a correlation between increasing stability and decreasing degradation in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli (39Pakula A.A. Sauer R.T. Proteins. 1989; 5: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) Degradation and resulting expression yield in the E. coli periplasm also correlates with thermodynamic stability of mutants of barnase (40Kwon W.S. Da Silva N.A. Kellis Jr., J.T. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The metabolic stability in E. coli of T4 lysozyme mutants correlates roughly with their thermal stability with several clear exceptions (41Inoue I. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29241-29246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the same general correlation between thermal and metabolic stability with several distinct exceptions is also observed for stability of radiolabeled T4 lysozyme mutants injected into HeLa cells (42Inoue I. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29247-29251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The available data indicate that secretion efficiency depends on the stability of the BPTI fold itself, rather than directly on the stability of the 14–38 disulfide. Because removal of cysteines 14 and 38 by mutagenesis does not itself substantially reduce secretion efficiency of otherwise wild-type BPTI (Table I and Fig. 3, Ref. 17Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Wittrup K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), destabilization of this disulfide per se is unlikely to directly reduce secretion efficiency. Furthermore, misfolding because of intramolecular thiol/disulfide rearrangements with free cysteines 14 and 38 cannot be responsible for reduced secretion of P13S or Y35L BPTI because the C14/38A mutation does not increase secretion of these mutants (Table I, Fig. 3). Destabilization of the 14–38 disulfide therefore must correspond to destabilization of the folded form of BPTI in the absence of the 14–38 disulfide. Such thermodynamic linkage between disulfide stability and folding stability has been demonstrated for several BPTI mutants previously (43Ma L.C. Anderson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3728-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) This linkage has also been demonstrated for mutants of DsbA (44Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and thioredoxin (45Lin T-Y. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5282-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The kinetic model presented in Fig. 6 leads to several alternative limiting regimes depending on a given protein's rates of folding and unfolding relative to the rates of export and retention. For BPTI and the mutants examined to date, it appears that the folding and unfolding rates in vivo are substantially more rapid than export and retention rates, leading to a rapid equilibration relative to the irreversible processes leading to export or degradation. For proteins that fold more slowly or are exported more rapidly following folding, such equilibration would not occur and the rate of folding would be expected to determine secretion efficiency. The intrinsic biophysical attributes of folded BPTI that lead to its slow export kinetics from the ER are currently under investigation. Strains W303-BD, W303-CQ, and W303–1b were a kind gift of D.

A 41-amino acid peptide, final sigma-conotoxin GVIIIA, was purified on the basis of its ability to inactivate the 5-HT3 receptor, an excitatory serotonin-gated ion channel. final sigma-Conotoxin contains a brominated tryptophan residue, which may be important for peptide activity because the endogenous ligand for the 5-HT3 receptor is a hydroxylated derivative of tryptophan. final sigma-Conotoxin inactivates the 5-HT3 receptor through competitive antagonism and is a highly selective inhibitor of this receptor. Serotonin receptors can now be included among the molecular targets of natural polypeptide neurotoxins."

Earlier studies demonstrated changes in neural response as a function of gaze direction and gaze distance in the dorsal visual cortical pathway to parietal cortex. These findings have been interpreted as evidence of the parietal pathway's role in spatial representation. Here, distance-dependent changes in neural response were also found to be common in neurons in the ventral pathway leading to inferotemporal cortex of monkeys. This result implies that the information necessary for object and spatial scaling is common to all visual cortical areas."

LPS caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in NO release and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genestein, the phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C inhibitor, D609, and the phosphatidate phosphodrolase inhibitor, propranolol, attenuated the LPS effects, whereas the PI-PLC inhibitor, U73122, had no effect. The PKC inhibitors (staurosporine, Ro 31–8220, Go 6976, and calphostin C) also inhibited LPS-induced NO release and iNOS expression. However, long term (24 h) pretreatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) did not affect the LPS response. Previous results have shown that TPA-induced translocation, but not down-regulation, of PKCη occurs in astrocytes (Chen, C. C., and Chen, W. C.

These data suggest that in astrocytes, LPS might activate phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C and phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase D through an upstream protein tyrosine kinase to induce PKC activation. Of the PKC isoforms present in these cells, only activation of PKCη by LPS resulted in the stimulation of NF-kB-specific DNA-protein binding and then initiated the iNOS expression and NO release.

Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). Low concentrations of NO play a role in neurotransmission and vasodilation. However, when secreted at higher concentrations, NO is implicated in the pathogenesis of stroke and other degenerative diseases, such as demyelinating conditions and ischemic and traumatic injury (2Jaffrey S.E. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). NO is formed enzymatically from l-arginine by nitric-oxide synthase (NOS). NOS enzymes are classified into two groups. One type (cNOS) is constitutively present in several cell types (e.g. neurons and endothelial cells) and is regulated predominantly at the post-transcriptional level by calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (2Jaffrey S.E. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In contrast, the inducible form (iNOS), expressed in various cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages, hepatocytes, and astrocytes, is induced in response to proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (3Nunokawa Y.

The mechanism of the signal transduction cascade involved in the induction of iNOS in response to LPS and cytokines is an active area of investigation. Although LPS-produced iNOS induction in primary astrocytes has been reported (6Galea E. Feinstein D.L. Reis D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proteins of the NF-kB family appear to be essential for the enhanced iNOS gene expression seen in macrophages exposed to LPS (15Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the p65 NF-kB also seems to be responsible for iNOS induction in astrocytes (16Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Aquino D.A. Li G.C.

In the present study, the intracellular signaling pathway by which LPS induces iNOS expression in primary astrocytes was studied. The results show that LPS might activate phosphatidylcholine-phospholipases C and D (PC-PLC and PC-PLD) via tyrosine phosphorylation to produce PKC and NF-kB activation, iNOS expression, and, finally, NO release. Of the PKC isoforms α, δ, θ, η, and ζ expressed in astrocytes (17Chen C.C. Chang J. Chen W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen C.C. Chen W.C. Glia. 1996; 17: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), only PKCη is involved in the regulation of LPS-induced NF-kB activation, iNOS expression, and NO release. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to iNOS was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Basal modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, glutamine, gentamycin, penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to PKCδ and η and the NF-kB probe were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. TPA was from L. C. Services Corp. (Woburn, MA). LPS (from Escherichia coliserotype 0127:B8), staurosporine, pyrolidine dithiocarbamate, sulfanilamide, and N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine were from Sigma. Genestein, calphostin C, Go 6976, and Ro 31–8220 were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). D609, U73122, and U73343 were from RBI (Natick, MA). T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Poly(dI·dC) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Reagents for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. [τ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. The horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit second antibody and ECL detecting reagent were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Glial cell cultures were prepared from the cerebellum of 8-day Wistar rats as described previously (17Chen C.C. Chang J. Chen W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cerebella were dissected and dissociated by mechanical chopping and trypsinization to obtain a cell suspension. Cells were plated at a density of 105 cells/well in poly-l-lysine-precoated 12-well plates for the nitrite assay and at a density of 107 cells/10-cm dish for iNOS and PKCη and δ isoform expression tests and the NF-kB gel shift assay. Cultures were maintained in basal modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin, which was changed twice each week. Cells grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% humidified air at 37 °C were used after 10–12 days in culture, at which time they consisted of confluent glial cells, which stained positively for glial fibrillary acidic protein (17Chen C.C. Chang J. Chen W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar). NO production in culture supernatant was evaluated by measuring nitrite, its stable degradation product, using the Griess reagent. The basal modified Eagle's medium was changed to phenol red-free medium before the cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24 h, and then the isolated supernatant was centrifuged and mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide, 0.1% naphthylethylene diamine dihydrochloride, 2% phosphoric acid) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min before the absorbance was measured at 550 nm in a microplate reader. Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) was used as a standard. In pretreatment experiments, cells were incubated with genestein (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), U73122 (a PI-PLC inhibitor), D609 (a PC-PLC inhibitor), propranolol (a phosphatidate phosphohyrolase inhibitor), staurosporine, calphostin C, Go 6976, or Ro 31–8220 (PKC inhibitors) for 30 min or with TPA for 24 h before the addition of LPS. Following treatment with LPS, or pretreatment with inhibitors, TPA or antisense oligonucleotides (see below) followed by LPS, the cells were harvested and collected. For studies of iNOS expression or PKCη and δ expression (antisense oligonucleotides treatment), cell homogenates were prepared and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 7.5% (iNOS) or 10% (PKC isoform) running gels, and then the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (17Chen C.C. Chang J. Chen W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane was incubated successively at room temperature with 0.1% milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TTBS) for 1 h, with rabbit antibodies specific for iNOS or PKCη or δ for 1 h and with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody for 30 min. After each incubation, the membrane was washed extensively with TTBS. The immunoreactive band was detected with ECL detecting reagents and developed with Hyperfilm-ECL. Phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized in trityl-on mode using an Applied Biosystems model 391 DNA synthesizer, as described previously (19Lin S.B. Huang S.S. Choo K.B. Chen P.J. Au L.C. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1100-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), using A, G, C, and T phosphoramidites, controlled pore glass supports, and sulfuring reagent purchased from Glen Research Corp. (Sterling, VA). The oligodeoxynucleotides were deblocked and cleaved from the solid support using concentrated ammonia water by a standard procedure. After evaporation of the ammonia, the deprotected oligodeoxynucleotides were purified on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Millipore, Milford, MA), as reported previously (20Lin S.B. Chang G.W. Teh G.W. Lin K.I. Au L.C. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 795-798PubMed Google Scholar). Control sequences (scrambled versions of the antisense oligonucleotides) with the same base composition as the PKCη antisense oligonucleotides were also synthesized. The sequences of the PKCη and δ antisense oligonucleotides and scrambled PKCη controls are listed in TableI.Table ISequences of antisense oligonucleotides and controls used in this studyOligonucleotideSequence (5′–3′)Target region on mRNA of PKC isoformaThe first nucleotide of the translation initiation codon was numbered 1.ηCTGCTGCCGGAGCCCCGA−25 to −8 of PKC-ηη-CCCGAGAGCCGCCGTCGTCControl with scrambled PKCη sequenceδGTGCCATGATGGAGCCTTTT−13 to +7 of PKC-δa The first nucleotide of the translation initiation codon was numbered 1. Open table in a new tab Following attachment on day 1 of culture, cells were treated with PKCη or δ antisense oligonucleotides or control oligonucleotides (10 μm) for 9 days (the medium was changed once) before challenge with 1 μg/ml LPS for 24 h, and then the protein levels of PKCη and δ were determined by Western blotting using antibodies specific for PKCη or δ. Control cells or cells pretreated with genestein, D609, propranolol or Ro 31–8220 for 30 min, TPA for 24 h, or antisense oligonucleotides for 9 days were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were then isolated as described previously (21Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Chen W.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pelleted. The cell pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm NaVO4) and incubated for 15 min on ice, and then the cells were lysed by the addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by vigorous vortexing for 10 s. The nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4), and the tube vigorously shaken at 4 °C for 15 min on a shaking platform. The nuclear extracts were then centrifuged, and the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing NF-kB sequences (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGGC-3′, Santa Cruz) was purchased and end-labeled with [τ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The nuclear extract (6–10 μg) was incubated with 1 ng of the32P-labeled NF-kB probe (40,000–60,000 cpm) in 10 μl of binding buffer containing 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), 15 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol at 30 °C for 20 min. DNA/nuclear protein complexes were separated from the DNA probe by electrophoresis on a native 6% polyacrylamide gel, and then the gels were vacuum-dried and subjected to autoradiography with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. Exposure of cells to LPS resulted in concentration- and time-dependent nitrite production and expression of the 130-kDa iNOS (Fig. 1). Using a 24-h exposure period, maximum nitrite release (65 ± 9 nmol/105 cells/24 h; n = 3) was obtained at 10 μg/ml LPS, and the basal nitrite release was 2 ± 1 nmol/105 cells/24 h (n = 3) (Fig.1 A). When cells were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for various times, nitrite release was significant at 12 h (8 ± 5 nmol/105 cells/24 h; n = 3) and maximal at 48 h (Fig. 1 B). In the following NO release experiments, the cells were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 24 h. In order to study the intracellular signaling pathway involved in the LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genestein was used. When cells were pretreated for 30 min with 30 μm genestein, LPS-induced nitrite production was inhibited by 35% and iNOS expression decreased (Fig.2 A). When cells were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μm U73122 or U73343 (an inactive analog of U73122), 50 μm D609, or 50 μM propranolol, LPS-induced nitrite production was inhibited 50 and 38% by D609 and propranolol, respectively, whereas U73122 and U73343 had no effect (Fig. 2 B); iNOS protein expression was also inhibited by D609 or propranolol but not by U73122 (Fig. 2 C). LPS-induced nitrite production and iNOS expression were both inhibited by D609 and propranolol, indicating the involvement of the PC-PLC and PC-PLD pathways. Both pathways can increase diacylglycerol levels and then activate PKC. To determine whether activation of PKC by LPS was involved in the regulation of LPS-induced NO production, PKC inhibitors were used. Pretreatment of cells for 30 min with 100 nm staurosporine, 0.5 μm Ro 31–8220, 3 μm Go 6976, or 100 nm calphostin C inhibited LPS-induced nitrite production by 48, 73, 47, or 26%, respectively; iNOS protein expression was also inhibited by Ro 31–8220 (Fig. 3 A). When cells were treated with 1 μm TPA for 24 h, NO release (10 ± 1 nmol/105 cells/24 h; n = 4) was seen; under these conditions, the LPS-induced nitrite production was 66 ± 5 nmol/105 cells/24 h (n = 7), which was greater than with LPS alone (48 ± 5 nmol/105 cells/24 h; n = 3), although not statistically significant by the t test (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained for iNOS expression (Fig. 3 B). Previous studies have shown that in macrophages, MDCK cells and astrocytes, PKCη is translocated but not down-regulated by TPA treatment (21Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Chen W.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the LPS-induced effects by PKC inhibitors, but not by long term TPA treatment, suggested the possible involvement of PKCη in LPS-induced NO production. Because PKCη is involved in the LPS-mediated NO production and iNOS expression, the effect of direct TPA-mediated activation of PKC on NO release and iNOS expression was examined. As shown in Fig.4, 1 μm TPA also induced a time-dependent increase in nitrite release. However, the increase was much smaller than that induced by LPS (compare with Fig.1 B). Similar time-dependent results were seen for TPA-induced iNOS expression (Fig. 4). To further study the involvement of PKCη and the lack of involvement of other isoforms in the LPS-induced NO release and iNOS expression, PKCη antisense and scrambled control oligonucleotides and antisense oligonucleotides for PKCδ, another isoform abundantly expressed in astrocytes (17Chen C.C. Chang J. Chen W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar), were used. Following treatment of primary astrocyte cultures with PKCη or PKCδ antisense oligonucleotides for 9 days, the expression levels of PKCη or δ were determined by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.5 A, 10 μm of PKCη or δ antisense oligonucleotides caused a specific reduction in the level of the corresponding immunoreactive isoform protein,e.g. PKCη antisense oligonucleotides specifically inhibited the expression of PKCη protein but had no effect on the expression of PKCδ. Because cerebellar astrocytes grow confluently after 10–12 days in culture, PKCη or δ antisense oligonucleotides were added for entire culture periods, and the reduction in the level of PKCη and PKCδ was similar to those shown in Fig.5 A. When cells were treated for 9 days with PKCη or δ antisense oligonucleotides, LPS-induced nitrite production was inhibited 39% by the PKCη antisense oligonucleotides, whereas the PKCδ antisense oligonucleotides, although they inhibited the expression of PKCδ, had no effect (Fig. 5 B). The control sequences for PKCη, which did not affect the expression of PKCη, also had no effect on the LPS response. Similar results were seen for LPS-induced iNOS expression (Fig. 5 B). In resting cells, the NF-kB heterodimer is held in the cytosol by binding to IkB (22Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar); after stimulation of the cells with various agents, the cytosolic NF-kB/IkB complex dissociates and free NF-kB translocates to the nuclei. pyrolidine dithiocarbamate, an antioxidant that acts as a specific inhibitor of NF-kB activation (23Schreck R. Meiser B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeverle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar), blocks the ability of astrocytes to produce nitrite production and the nuclear binding activity for NF-kB normally seen in response to LPS. 2C.-C. Chen, J.-K. Wang, D.-Y. Lin, and W.-C. Chen, unpublished data. Thus, activation of NF-kB is critical in the induction of iNOS by LPS in astrocytes. We performed an EMSA using oligonucleotides containing NF-kB recognition site-like sequences present in the iNOS gene (13Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Synder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) and nuclear extracts prepared from LPS-stimulated cells. In nuclear extracts of unstimulated astrocytes, one faint NF-kB-specific DNA-protein complex was identified, the intensity of which markedly increased following exposure of the cells to 1 μg/ml LPS for 10 min and was even greater after 1 h of treatment (Fig.6 A). For the EMSA, cells were treated with LPS for 1 h. After pretreatment of cells for 30 min with 30 μmgenestein, 50 μm D609, 50 μm propranolol, or 0.5 μm Ro 31–8220, the LPS-induced activation of NF-kB-specific DNA-protein complex formation was inhibited (Fig. 6,B and C). However, overnight pretreatment with TPA, which, in astrocytes, down-regulates conventional and new PKC isoforms, but not PKCη (17Chen C.C. Chang J. Chen W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen C.C. Chen W.C. Glia. 1996; 17: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Chen W.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), did not affect the LPS-induced NF-kB activation (Fig. 6 C). Following exposure of cells to 1 μm TPA for 1 h, activation of NF-kB-specific DNA-protein complex formation was also seen (Fig.7 A). When cells were treated with 10 μm of PKCη antisense oligonucleotide for 9 days, the LPS-induced NF-kB activation was inhibited, whereas PKCη control sequences had no effect (Fig. 7 B). In both cultured astrocytes and C6 glioma cells, LPS induces NO production (6Galea E. Feinstein D.L. Reis D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10945-10949Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 24Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Roberts S. Berquist H. Wang H. Reis D.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In macrophages, activation by LPS requires the presence of a 53-kDa glycoprotein, mCD14 (25Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3406) Google Scholar), which is attached to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety (26Haziot A. Chen S. Ferrero F. Low M.G. Silber R. Goyert S.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 547-552PubMed Google Scholar). A second form of CD14, soluble CD14, is found at high concentrations in the serum (27Bazil V. Horejst V. Baudys M. Kristofova H. Strominger J.L. Kostka W. Hilgert I. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 1583-1589Google Scholar), and can confer LPS responsiveness upon cells that lack mCD14, including astrocytoma cells (28Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V. Espevik T. Fintay B.B. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Complexes formed between LPS and either mCD14 or soluble CD14 are thought to lead to transfer of bound LPS to a distinct signaling molecule, which may be either transmembrane or intracellular (29Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). The formation of LPS/CD14 complexes is accelerated by LPS-binding protein (30Hailman E. Lichtenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miler D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.H. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), which is also present at high concentrations in normal serum and thus can contribute to the serum effects (31Pugin J. Schurer-Maly C.C. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2744-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of CD14 mRNA and protein in rat astrocytes and that LPS-produced iNOS induction requires membrane and soluble forms of CD14 (32Galea E. Reis D.J. Fox E.S. Xu H. Feinstein D.L. J. Neuroimmunol. 1996; 64: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, in astrocytes, formation of a LPS/LPS-binding protein complex might allow binding to, and activation of, CD14, and then trigger signal transduction to initiate the expression of iNOS and NO release. Although PKC has been shown to be involved in LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO production in macrophages (33Severn A. Wakelam M.J.O. Liew F.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 199: 461-466Google Scholar, 34Paul A. Pendreigh R.H. Plevin R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it has been reported to be unnecessary for iNOS induction by LPS in astrocytes (11Simmons M. Murphy S. Glia. 1994; 11: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, four PKC inhibitors, calphostin C, Go 6976, Ro 31–8220, and staurosporine, inhibited LPS-stimulated NO production and iNOS expression, indicating that PKC activation is an obligatory event in the LPS-mediated regulation of NO release and iNOS expression in astrocytes. PKC is activated by the physiological activator diacylglycerol, which can be generated either directly by the action of PLC or indirectly by a pathway involving the production of phosphatidic acid by PLD, followed by a dephosphorylation reaction catalyzed by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. Normally, the PLC involved in the production of diacylglycerol is PI-PLC, but PC-PLC may also be involved (36Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar, 37Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The PC-PLC inhibitor, D609, and the phosphatidate phosphohydrolase inhibitor, propranolol, both inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO production, whereas the PI-PLC inhibitor, U73122, had no effect. Thus, LPS may act through the PC-PLC and PC-PLD pathways, but not the PI-PLC pathway, to induce PKC activation in astrocytes; this contrasts with the situation in RAW 264.7 macrophages in which the PI-PLC and PC-PLC pathways, but not the PC-PLD pathway, are involved (38Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol.,. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). The mechanism involved in the activation of PC-PLC and PC-PLD is still unknown but may involve tyrosine phosphorylation (37Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 39Dubyak G.R. Schomisch S.J. Kusner D.J. Xie M. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Genestein also inhibited LPS-induced iNOS induction and NO production in astrocytes. The tyrosine kinase involved might be p53/p56lyn, because, in monocytes, LPS activates this kinase, which is associated with CD14 (40Stefanova I. Corcoran M.L. Horak E.M. Wahl L.M. Bolen J.B. Horak I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20725-20728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Beaty C.D. Franklin T.L. Uehara Y. Wilson C.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, in astrocytes, the LPS/LPS-binding protein complex binds to CD14 and then might activate PC-PLC and PC-PLD via an upstream protein tyrosine phosphorylation to elicit PKC activation and, finally, iNOS expression and NO production. Although PKC inhibitors attenuated LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO production, long term TPA pretreatment, which down-regulates PKCα, δ, and θ, but not PKCη, in astrocytes (17Chen C.C. Chang J. Chen W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen C.C. Chen W.C. Glia. 1996; 17: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), had no effect, indicating the possible involvement of PKCη in LPS-mediated effects. To confirm the involvement of PKCη, PKCη antisense oligonucleotides and the scrambled controls or antisense oligonucleotides for PKCδ, which is abundantly expressed in astrocytes and down-regulated by TPA, were used. The specificity of the PKCη and PKCδ antisense oligonucleotides was demonstrated (Fig. 5 A), and the results showed inhibition of LPS-stimulated iNOS expression and NO production by PKCη antisense oligonucleotides but not by PKCδ antisense or control oligonucleotides. Thus, a crucial role for PKCη in the LPS-induced stimulation of NO production and iNOS expression has been demonstrated. The PKC family, which consists of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases, is believed to play a major role in cellular functions. Molecular cloning has shown that it consists of at least 12 isoforms with different tissue expressions (36Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar), which have been shown to be related to specialized cell functions (36Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Primary cerebellar astrocytes express the new types of PKCδ, θ, and η, which are not expressed in neuronal granule cells (17Chen C.C. Chang J. Chen W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar,18Chen C.C. Chen W.C. Glia. 1996; 17: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 3W.-C. Chen, and C.-C. Chen, unpublished data. PKCδ and θ, but not PKCη, have been shown to be involved in the regulation of receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis (17Chen C.C. Chang J. Chen W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen C.C. Chen W.C. Glia. 1996; 17: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, in this study, PKCη, but not other isoforms, was shown to be involved in the LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO production. This is further evidence that different members of the PKC family within a single cell elicit specific physiological responses. However, PKCη, which is abundantly expressed in RAW 264.7 macrophages (21Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Chen W.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was not involved in the LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO production (38Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol.,. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). The transcriptional factor, NF-kB, is critical in the induction of iNOS by LPS in macrophages (13Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Synder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 14Xie Q.W. Wishnan R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). In astrocytes, the NF-kB blocker, pyrolidine dithiocarbamate, inhibits LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression,2 indicating that NF-kB is also critical in the induction of iNOS by LPS in these cells. LPS increased the levels of the NF-kB-specific DNA-protein complex in nuclear extracts (Fig.6 A); this activation was inhibited by genestein, D609, propranolol, or Ro 31–8220 but not by long term TPA treatment. Furthermore, PKCη antisense oligonucleotides, but not the scrambled controls, attenuated this activation, indicating the involvement of PKCη in the LPS-stimulated up-regulation of iNOS in astrocytes. Direct activation of PKC by TPA does induce NF-kB activation, NO production, and iNOS expression in astrocytes (Figs. 4 and7 A). Similar findings have been reported in peritoneal macrophages, hepatocytes, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (42Hortelano S. Genaro A.M. Bosca L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 43Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Velasco M. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) but not in RAW 264.7 macrophages, in which TPA alone did not induce NF-kB activation and NO production (38Chen C.C. Wang J.K. Lin S.B. J. Immunol.,. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar, 45Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Bodelon O.G. Velasco M. Whelan R. Parker P.J. Bosca L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32028-32033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the role of PKCη has been clearly demonstrated, other LPS-activated components are also involved in the co-stimulation of NF-kB and iNOS expression, because direct activation of PKC by TPA induced less NF-kB activation and NO production than LPS stimulation (Figs. 1 B, 4, and7 A). Glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, are involved in lesion and plaque formation in multiple sclerosis and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a central nervous system disorder with immune-mediated destruction of myelin and the myelin-producing cells, oligodendrocytes. The presence of iNOS in tissues of patients with multiple sclerosis and in animals with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis suggests that NO may play a role in the central nervous system autoimmune diseases (35Bagasra O. Michaels F.H. Zheng Y.M. Boroski L.E. Spitsin S.V. Fu Z.F. Tawadros R. Koprowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12041-12045Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 46Lin R.F.

Invest. 1994; 93: 2684-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Rodent astrocytes and microglia express a high level of iNOS and release significant amounts of NO within hours of LPS stimulation (Refs. 6Galea E. Feinstein D.L. Reis D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10945-10949Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 7Merrill J.E. Ignarro L.J. Sherman M.P. Melinek J. Lance T.E. J.

Neurosci. 1993; 16: 323-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar and the present study). Astrocytes are the major cell population in the central nervous system; therefore, induction of iNOS in astrocytes may be an important source of NO in central nervous system inflammatory disorders associated with neuronal and oligodendrocytes death (9Mitrovic B. Ignarro L.J. Montestruque S. Smoll A. Merril J.E. Neuroscience. 1994; 61: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In summary, the signaling pathway involved in the LPS-induced activation of PKC in primary astrocytes was explored, and the PKC isoform η, but not other isoforms, was found to be involved in the regulation of LPS-induced NF-kB activation, iNOS expression, and NO release. This is the first study showing the involvement of these two mechanisms in LPS-stimulated NO release in such cells."

We expression-cloned a group of PKC-binding proteins and identified a high molecular weight, heat-soluble protein as the major PKC-binding protein in REF52 fibroblasts (Chapline, C., Mousseau, B., Ramsay, K., Duddy, S., Li, Y., Kiley, S. C., and Jaken, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 6417–6422). In this study, we demonstrate that this PKC-binding protein, clone 72, is also a PKC substrate in vitro and in vivo. Using a combination of phosphopeptide mapping, Edman degradation, and electrospray mass spectrometry, serine residues 283, 300, 507, and 515 were identified as the major in vitro PKC phosphorylation sites in clone 72. Phosphorylation state-selective antibodies were raised against phosphopeptides encompassing each of the four phosphorylation sites. These antibodies were used to determine that phorbol esters stimulate phosphorylation of serines 283, 300, 507, and 515 in cultured cells, indicating that clone 72 is directly phosphorylated by PKC in living cells. Phosphorylated clone 72 preferentially accumulates in membrane protrusions and ruffles, indicating that PKC activation and clone 72 phosphorylation are involved in membrane-cytoskeleton remodeling. These data lend further evidence to the model that PKCs directly interact with, phosphorylate, and modify the functions of a group of substrate proteins, STICKs (substrates that interact withC-kinase).

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). PKC activity has been associated with a variety of growth and pathological defects, indicating that PKCs are involved in regulating fundamental cellular processes. PKC is the major cellular receptor for tumor-promoting phorbol esters, and consequently, PKC activation has been linked to later events in multistage carcinogenesis, i.e. tumor promotion/progression. Phorbol esters and other PKC activators rapidly induce a variety of cellular responses including cell shape changes, cytoskeletal remodeling, decreased cell-cell communication, and increased exocytosis. The diversity of the observed responses has made it complicated to focus on particular phosphorylation events that mediate changes in biological activity. Identifying target proteins and determining how PKC phosphorylation alters their activities are keys to understanding the role of PKC in cell regulation. Several approaches have been used to identify PKC-binding proteins. PICKs (proteins that interact withC-kinase) are PKC substrates identified by yeast two-hybrid screening (2Staudinger J. Lu J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). RACKs (receptors foractivated C-kinase) are non-substrate proteins that bind to catalytically active PKC. These may target active PKCs to the vicinity of appropriate substrate proteins (3Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Several years ago, we began using a PKC overlay assay to identify PKC-interacting proteins (4Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Liao L. Hyatt S.L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We found that many of the binding proteins identified by this method, including MARCKS and the related protein MacMARCKS, were PKC substrates (5Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth Diff. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore named this group of PKC-binding proteins/substrates STICKs (forsubstrates that interact withC-kinase. In cultured cells, phorbol esters stimulate 32PO4 incorporation into STICKs (7Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth Diff. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar,8Dong L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25534-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), indicating that PKC activation increases their phosphorylation. However, since activating PKC can also lead to increased activity of other cellular kinases, additional evidence is needed to determine if the increased phosphorylation is directly mediated by PKC. This is accomplished by comparing in vitro and in vivophosphorylation sites in target proteins. In recent studies, we determined that two of the PKC-binding proteins we identified, α-adducin and the novel γ-adducin (8Dong L. Chapline C. Mousseau B. Fowler L. Ramsay K. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25534-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), are in vivo PKC substrates by demonstrating that Ser660 is phosphorylated by PKC in vitro and that phorbol esters stimulate Ser660 phosphorylation in living cells (9Fowler L. Dong L.Q. van de Water B. Bowes R. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). Increased phosphorylation in transformed renal cells in culture and in renal tumors was also noted (9Fowler L. Dong L.Q. van de Water B. Bowes R. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fowler L. Everitt J. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 405-413PubMed Google Scholar). The major PKC-binding protein/substrate detected by overlay assays in normal REF52 fibroblasts (REF A cells) is a >200-kDa heat-soluble PKC substrate referred to as clone 72 (11Chapline C. Mousseau B. Ramsay K. Duddy S. Li Y. Kiley S.C. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6417-6422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and also as SSeCKS (12Lin X. Tombler E.

Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Clone 72 is also closely related to gravin, an autoantigen identified in patients with myasthenia gravis (14Nauert J.B. Klauck T.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Clone 72 protein and message levels are down-modulated in oncogene-transformed cells, indicating that this protein may play an important role in normal growth regulation. In fact, reexpressing clone 72 (SSeCKS) in transformed cells has been shown to attenuate growth and transformation (15Lin X.Y. Gelman I.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2304-2312PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of the present studies was to determine if clone 72 is an in vivo PKC substrate by comparingin vitro and in vivo sites of phosphorylation. Our results indicate that clone 72 is phosphorylated by PKC at multiple sites in vitro and in vivo. These studies extend our evidence that PKC directly binds to and phosphorylates a group of target proteins (STICKs). These results contribute to the emerging model that STICKs are primary targets for PKC phosphorylation and that phosphorylation of STICKs is directly related to the role of PKC in regulating the complex processes of cell growth, death, and differentiation. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce HindIII and Xma sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the binding and phosphorylation domain encompassing amino acid residues 496–531 (Table I). In this process, Val497 in the wild type sequence was converted to Leu. This conservative change did not alter PKC binding, PS binding, or PKC phosphorylation. The HindIII and Xma sites were used to insert double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides that encode for the deletion mutant sequences 1–4 (Table I). Site-directed mutagenesis was also used to prepare the single and triple amino acid changes in mutants 5–7 (Table I). Mutagenesis was done with double-stranded plasmid DNA using the Chameleon mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutant proteins were expressed from pTrc (Invitrogen) as His-tagged fusion proteins. All sequences were verified by sequence analysis.Table ILysyl peptides identified by LC-ESMS following PKC phosphorylation of C34EPeptide residuesRetention timeObserved massCalculated massDifference (Obs. − Calc.)SequencePhosphorylation sitePeptideClone 72min1 and 2NDaND, peptide not detected.249.1CK3–829.6670.8670.40.4VQSPLK3–928.5798.8798.50.3VQSPLKK10–1732.8837.7837.50.2LFSSSGLK10–1733.2917.5837.580.0LFS SS GLK10–1734.8917.5837.580.0LF pS SSGLKSer12Ser50710–1831.7965.7965.60.1LFSSSGLKK10–1832.21045.8965.680.2LFSSSGLKK10–1833.51045.8965.680.2LFSSSGLKK18–22 or 19–2310.6611.5531.380.2KLpSGK or LpSGKKSer20Ser51519–22ND403.2LSGK19–229.4483.5403.280.3LpSGKSer20Ser51519–23ND531.3LSGKK19–23 or 18–2212.3611.3531.380.0LpSGKK or KLpSGKSer20Ser51524–25ND274.3QK26–27ND203.2GK28–347.2646.5646.30.2RGGGDESynthetic peptide C34E (designed from clone 72 residues; (see “Materials and Methods”) was phosphorylated with PKC, digested with endoproteinase Lys-C, and analyzed by LC-ESMS (Fig. 6) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lysyl peptides are listed by residues, HPLC retention time, calculated and observed masses, and amino acid sequence.

Potential phosphorylation sites are in italic type; identified sites are in boldface type. For quantitative measurements, purified, recombinant proteins and peptides were phosphorylated with purified recombinant PKCα (PanVera) at 30 °C for 15 min using standard conditions (4Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. For maximum phosphorylation needed for identifying phosphorylated residues, synthetic peptide C34E designed from clone 72 residues (Lys496–Glu529, with an N-terminal cysteine added to facilitate coupling) (3.5 μm) was phosphorylated with PKCα (13.5 nm) for 2–4 h until maximum phosphorylation was reached as monitored by incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate. The phosphorylated synthetic peptide (6.25 μg) was digested with 0.6 μg of endoproteinase Lys-C overnight. The digested peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESMS). Synthetic peptide corresponding to clone 72 residues Arg296–Lys305 (10 μm) was phosphorylated with PKCα (3.0 nm). The undigested peptide was analyzed by LC-ESMS. Automated FMOC solid phase synthesis was used to produce PKC phosphorylation substrate peptides R10K and C34E as well as calibration and tuning reagents for the mass spectrometer (peptides G9I, K13L, L20R, V26E, E10A, K6R, and bA5K). Peptides G9I (GRTGRRNSI), K13L (KTREGNVRVSREL), L20R (LKPVKKKKIKREIKILENLR), V26E (VAMKKIRLEEEGVPSTAIREISLLKE), and C34E (CKVQSPLKKLFSSSGLKKLSGKKQKGKRGGGGDE) were synthesized at the 250-μmol scale on HMP (Wang) resin using a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems model 430A Peptide Synthesizer and the Applied Biosystems FastMoc synthesizer program, cleaved from the solid support with trifluoroacetic acid, and extracted with acetic acid as described previously (16Escribano J. Hernando N. Ghosh S. Crabb J. Coca-Prados M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides E10A (EPQpYEEIPIA-NH2) (where pY represents phosphorylated tyrosine) and K6R (KRpTIRR-NH2) (where pT represents phosphorylated threonine) were also prepared on the model 430A instrument (300-μmol scale) using the FastMoc program, Fmoc-phosphotyrosine (PO3H2)−OH, Fmoc-phosphothreonine (O-benzyl), and Fmoc-4-methylbenzylhydrylamine (MBHA) rink amide resin. PKC substrate peptide R10K (RKKTSFKKSK) (100-μmol scale) and phosphopeptide bA5K (biotin-ApSSYK) (where pS represents phosphorylated serine) (50-μmol scale) were synthesized with a Rainin Symphony/Multiplex Peptide Synthesizer using the synthesizer software (version 3.2) provided by the instrument manufacturer (Protein Technologies, Inc.) and Fmoc-phosphoserine (O-benzyl). Following automatic cleavage from the solid support on the Symphony instrument, peptides were precipitated from trifluoroacetic acid with ice-cold ether, washed two or three times with cold ether, and either vacuum-dried or purified by RP-HPLC. Extended double coupling steps were used for Fmoc-phosphoamino acids on both instruments; two equimolar additions of the Fmoc-phosphoamino acid were made approximately 6–12 h apart with a total coupling reaction time of 18 h. Biotin was coupled with a single coupling reaction of 12 h. Fmoc-phosphoamino acids,d-biotin, Wang resins (with or without preloaded Fmoc amino acids), and Fmoc-MBHA rink amide resin were from AnaSpec. Reagents and chemicals used with the Symphony instrument were from Rainin, and those used with the model 430A instrument were from PE Applied Biosystems and Burdick and Jackson. Synthetic peptides used for mass spectrometry tuning and calibration were purified by RP-HPLC using aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile solvents and a 10μ Vydac C18 column (2.2 × 25 cm). All synthetic peptides were quality control-analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC and amino acid analysis (17Crabb J.W. Gaur V.P. Garwin G.G. Marx S.V. Chapline C. Johnson C.M. Saari J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16674-16683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in addition to ESMS. Phenylthiocarbamyl amino acid analysis was performed as described previously using an automated analysis system (Applied Biosystems model 420H/130A/920) (18West K.A. Crabb J.W. Angeletti R. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. 1992: 233-242Google Scholar). ESMS, LC-ESMS, and low energy collision tandem MS (MS/MS) were performed with a Perkin-Elmer Sciex API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thornhill, Canada) fitted with articulated ion spray plenums and atmospheric pressure ionization sources. Initial tuning and calibration was with a standard mixture of polypropylene glycol provided by PE Sciex. Resolution was adjusted to about 50% valley between adjacent isotope peaks in a singly charged cluster, allowing singly charged ions to be identified by apparent spacing between peaks and doubly charged ions to be distinguished from those with higher charge states. The nebulization gas for negative ion monitoring was bottled air (Medical Grade USP, Merriam-Graves, Claremont, NH), and for positive ion monitoring nitrogen was used at 40 p.s.i. Nitrogen was also used as the curtain gas and was supplied from a Dewar flask (XL-45, Taylor-Wharton) of liquid nitrogen (Merriam-Graves). For infusions in positive ion mode, spectra were acquired at an orifice potential of 60 V over a scan range of m/z 300–1500 using 0.25-atomic mass unit steps and a total scan time of 4.8 s. For negative ion monitoring, the ion spray needle voltage was operated at −4.0 kV and the focusing ring at −230 V; for positive ion monitoring, the ion spray needle voltage was 4.3 kV and the focusing ring was at 300 V. Low energy collision MS/MS was performed with the RO2 voltage set between −55 and −70 V, nitrogen as the collision gas, and CAD gas settings between 3 and 4, and 50–70 scans were accumulated. Parent ion transmission was maximized by setting Q1 to transmit about a 2–3m/z window around the selected ion. LC-ESMS with selective ion monitoring for PO3− at m/z 79 was performed in negative ion mode at high orifice potential (−190 V) over a narrow scan range of m/z 78.8–79.2 using 0.1-atomic mass unit steps, a dwell time of 100 ms/step, and a total scan time of 0.5 s. In the same analysis, full scans in positive ion mode were acquired at a lower orifice potential (60 V) over the scan range m/z 300–2000 using 0.25-atomic mass unit steps and a total scan time of 4 s. This was accomplished by looping the negative ion and positive ion experiments together with computer-controlled polarity reversal between each scan. The higher orifice potential in negative ion mode enhances collision-induced decomposition of phosphopeptides, producing the diagnostic PO3− fragment ion, thus allowing selective detection of phosphopeptides (19Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Bean M.F. Carr S.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 4: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The lower orifice potential used for full scans in positive ion mode allowed acquisition of mass spectra for all peptides (19Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Bean M.F. Carr S.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 4: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Seven synthetic peptides, including three phosphopeptides containing phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, or phosphothreonine, were used to optimize negative ion detection sensitivity for the m/z 79 fragment ion or to serve as internal controls for PO3− monitoring during LC-ESMS or to verify correct calibration during LC-ESMS. Synthetic peptides used for mass spectrometry include G9I (M = 1015.6), K13L (M = 1542.9), L20R (M = 2475.2), V26E (M = 2940.5), and phosphopeptides E10A (M = 1266.6), K6R (M = 907.5), and b-A5K (M = 860.4). For LC-ESMS, the HPLC eluant was split, with 22% going to the mass spectrometer and the remainder collected in 1-min fractions. RP-HPLC for LC-ESMS was performed at a flow rate of 50 μl/min on a 5μ Vydac C18 microbore column (1 × 250 mm) using an Applied Biosystems model 120A HPLC system equipped with a 75-μl dynamic mixer and aqueous acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid solvents (17Crabb J.W. Gaur V.P. Garwin G.G. Marx S.V. Chapline C. Johnson C.M. Saari J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16674-16683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Portions of select HPLC fractions were diluted 1:3 in 0.2% formic acid, 50% methanol and infused at 2 μl/min for MS/MS analysis. Four phospho-serine peptides containing the phosphorylation sites identified in in vitro reactions were synthesized with N-terminal cysteines added to facilitate coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and/or solid supports. The peptides were as follows: Asn276–Lys286 included phosphoserine 283; Arg296–Lys305 included phosphoserine 300; Lys503–Lys512 included phosphoserine 507; and Leu511–Arg523 included phosphoserine 515. Antisera were raised in rabbits and purified against the cognate peptides coupled to agarose. REF52 cells were grown, and cell lysates were prepared as described previously (7Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth Diff. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (25–50 μg of protein) were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with immunopurified antisera preparations under standard conditions, and reactive bands were detected with ECL reagents. The phosphorylation state-insensitive antibody was raised to the recombinant fusion protein containing amino acid residues 388–790 (clone 72 original) (11Chapline C. Mousseau B. Ramsay K. Duddy S. Li Y. Kiley S.C. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6417-6422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). REF52 cells were grown on glass coverslips. Cells were fixed in formaldehyde and permeabilized with methanol as described previously (20Jaken S. Leach K. Klauck T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with affinity-purified primary antibodies, washed, and then incubated with FITC-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies. Photomicrographs were taken on a Nikon Optiphot microscope. In previous studies, we prepared eight overlapping clone 72 fragments that span the entire open reading frame. Of the eight recombinant proteins, only fragments 1, 2, and 3 (from the N terminus) were phosphorylated in vitrowith PKC. 2C. Chapline, J. Cottom, Y. Li, J. Scott, and S. Jaken, submitted for publication. To identify sites of phosphorylation, the phosphorylated fragments were digested with proteases, and phosphopeptides were isolated by HPLC and identified by Edman degradation. Those studies identified three phosphopeptides containing putative PKC phosphorylation sites, Thr280–Phe288, Arg296–Asp308, and Arg494–Glu530. We have now extended these studies using mass spectrometry to identify the PKC phosphorylation sites in these peptides. The synthetic peptide C34E (designed from residues Lys496–Glu529 with cysteine added) was phosphorylated with PKC and then digested with endoproteinase Lys-C. Identified peptides with their corresponding retention times and masses are summarized in Table I. Several lysyl peptides (representing partially digested fragments) containing a single serine residue (Ser20 in peptide C34E) corresponding to serine 515 in clone 72 showed an increased mass of 80 Da, indicative of phosphate incorporation. Several lysyl peptides containing serine residues 507–509 also showed an 80-Da increase in mass, indicating that one of these serine residues is also a target. Observed masses of lysyl peptides containing serine 500 correlated with calculated masses; therefore, serine 500 is not a PKC target (Table I). To determine which of serines 507–509 were phosphorylated, lysyl peptide LFSSSGLK (corresponding to residues 505–512 from clone 72) was further analyzed by low energy collision MS/MS (Fig.1). The sequence was determined from the loss in fragment mass starting from the C terminus (y fragments) or N terminus (b fragments). This analysis confirms that the serine corresponding to Ser507 in clone 72 is phosphorylated. Thus, Ser507 and Ser515, but not Ser500 are in vitro PKC phosphorylation sites in fragment 3 (Met387–Ile790). Phosphorylated residues in the other phosphorylation site found in fragment 2 (Gln261–Gly532) of clone 72 were identified by phosphorylating the synthetic peptide corresponding to residues Arg296–Lys305. Phosphorylation resulted in an observed mass increase of 80 Da, indicating that only one of the three serines and threonines is the preferred site (Fig.2, A and B). Low energy collision MS/MS analysis showed that phosphorylation occurred at serine 300 (Fig. 2 C). Several mutants within the fragment 3 phosphorylation site were constructed to analyze the structural requirements for PKC binding and phosphorylation (Table II). Fragment 3 and a subfragment (subfragment 3, Ser370–Glu620) had quantitatively similar PKC binding activity, indicating that the PKC binding motif is contained within this region (Fig.3). Mutating the three tandem serine residues to alanines (S507–509A) did not influence binding, indicating that these residues are not critical for PKC binding. Phenylalanine residues in the MARCKS phosphorylation domain have been shown to be important for hydrophobic interactions with PS at the membrane interface (21Wertz S.L. Savino Y. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11104-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Replacing phenylalanine 506 with valine (F506V) severely attenuated PKC binding and PS binding (Fig. 3). Thus, interactions of the clone 72 and MARCKS phosphorylation domain peptides with PS may be somewhat analogous. Structural changes in this motif were introduced by replacing leucine 511 with proline (L511P). According to Chou-Fasman and Garnier-Robson rules, this mutation is predicted to decrease α-structure and increase β-structure. This mutation also coordinately decreased PKC and PS binding. These results identify the Lys497–Pro511 region as a major determinant of phospholipid-dependent PKC binding. Neither of these mutations influenced the net positive charge of this domain, indicating that PKC and PS binding are primarily regulated by hydrophobic interactions and/or secondary structure.Table IIClone 72 mutant constructsConstructSequenceSubfragment 3(502)LKKLFSSSGLKKLSGKKQK(521)F506VLKKLVSSSGLKKLSGKKQKL511PLKKLFSSSGPKKLSGKKQKS507–509ALKKLFAAAGLKKLSGKKQKMutants in the clone 72 phosphorylation site within the Lys496–Pro531 fragment were prepared and expressed as His6-tagged fusion proteins. Open table in a new tab Mutants in the clone 72 phosphorylation site within the Lys496–Pro531 fragment were prepared and expressed as His6-tagged fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, phosphorylation of S507–509A relative to the wild type sequence was decreased, which verifies that these residues are among the PKC targets. Surprisingly, the F506V and L511P mutants were relatively better PKC substrates than the wild type protein, despite their decreased PKC and PS binding. Kinetic analysis of L511P mutant phosphorylation demonstrated that this was due to an increased Vmax with no significant effect on Km (Fig. 5). The Vmax value was increased 2.2-fold for the F506V mutant compared with subfragment 3. Differences inKm values were <20%. One potential explanation for this result is that phosphorylatable residues in the wild type sequence are partially masked, and mutations in this region increase accessibility to PKC.Figure 5Kinetic analysis of clone 72 phosphorylation. Subfragment 3 and mutant F506V (0.13–5 μm) were phosphorylated by PKC in the presence of 1 mm EGTA, 1.2 mm calcium chloride, 20 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 200 nm PDBu at 30 °C for 15 min. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis, and phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography. Phosphate incorporation was quantitated by densitometry of the autorad. Data are duplicate measurements. Lines drawn are best fit determined by linear regression analysis. Similar results were found in two additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if the PKC phosphorylation sites identified in in vitro studies were actual sites in vivo, antisera were raised to phosphopeptides containing the putative phosphorylation sites Ser300, Ser507, and Ser515. In addition, an antiserum to Ser283 was prepared, since preliminary in vitro phosphorylation studies identified Thr280–Phe289 as a phosphopeptide. Antisera were affinity-purified against the cognate phosphopeptides. Specificities of the antibodies were tested by comparing their reactivities against the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the immunizing peptides. As shown in Fig.6, each of the antibodies preferentially recognizes the corresponding phosphopeptide compared with the unphosphorylated peptide. The antibodies did not cross-react with unphosphorylated recombinant clone 72 proteins. Furthermore, each of the antibodies specifically recognizes its cognate peptide and does not cross-react with other Ser(P)-containing peptides. Thus, these antibodies recognize context-specific Ser(P) and not Ser(P) alone. These data indicate that these antibodies are phosphorylation state-selective and can be used to monitor clone 72 phosphorylation at selected residues. To determine if clone 72 is phosphorylated by PKC in vivo, we prepared extracts from REF52 cells that had been treated with the PKC activator, PDBu. As shown in Fig. 7, phorbol esters stimulated phosphorylation at serines 283, 300, 507, and 515. The relative increases in antibody binding were determined by densitometry of immunoblots and were 634 ± 351, 297 ± 185, 1996 ± 875, and 783 ± 300 (means ± S.D., n = 4)for phosphoserines 283, 300, 507, and 515, respectively. The correlation between the phosphorylation sites identified in in vitro and in vivo assays, indicates that clone 72 is an endogenous PKC substrate. To gain insight into the function of clone 72 and the effects of PKC phosphorylation, we compared the localization of clone 72 and phosphorylated clone 72 by immunofluorescence. Each of the clone 72 antibodies used for immunofluorescence preferentially recognized only clone 72 on immunoblots of REF52 cell extracts (Fig.8 A), which demonstrates their suitability for immunolocalization studies. In unstimulated cells, total clone 72 (monitored with a phosphorylation state nonspecific antibody) is distributed throughout the cytoplasm and concentrated in membrane ruffles (Fig. 8 B). In contrast, phosphoserine 300 and 515 antibodies did not detect substantial cytoplasmic staining. With these antibodies, staining was concentrated in membrane protrusions and ruffles. These data indicate that under physiological conditions, PKC activation and clone 72 phosphorylation are preferentially localized to the cell perimeter. The prominent nuclear staining observed with the phosphoserine 515 antibody is not seen with other antibodies and appears to be an artifact of this particular antibody. PDBu caused a redistribution of total clone 72 toward the perinuclear space but did not substantially influence the staining intensity. In contrast, PDBu substantially increased the immunostaining seen with the phosphoserine 300 and 515 antibodies. Staining was concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm but was also apparent in membrane protrusions and ruffles. PKC isozymes expressed in these cells (α, δ, ε, and ζ) are also found in these locations. However, the broad distribution patterns of PKCs and clone 72 do not permit the detailed comparison required to assess colocalization. Other approaches will be required to determine which PKCs interact with and phosphorylate clone 72 in vivo. Since PDBu is cell-permeable, it can activate PKCs throughout the cell, and its actions are not limited to the cell surface. To investigate physiological PKC activation and clone 72 phosphorylation, cells grown on coverslips were artificially wounded by scraping the monolayer with a sharp object. Cells were then stained with antibodies to actin and clone 72 (Fig. 9). The double staining clearly demonstrates that phosphorylated clone 72 is concentrated in membrane ruffles and regions in which actin is depolymerized. These results demonstrate a strong correlation among PKC activation, clone 72 phosphorylation, and dynamic actin remodeling. PKC phosphorylates a wide variety of proteins in in vitro reactions, many of which are not relevant physiological substrates in vivo. The relatively limited number of PKC phosphorylation events that occur in vivo indicates that PKC access to substrates is regulated in cells. One mechanism for limiting PKC phosphorylations to appropriate substrate proteins would be through direct, high affinity interactions of PKC with its substrates. We have cloned several PKC-interacting proteins based on their ability to bind PKC in an in vitro assay (4Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding proteins identified by this method include the PKC substrates MARCKS and the related protein MacMARCKS (22Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and two forms of adducin, α-adducin and the novel γ-adducin (8Dong L. Chapline C. Mousseau B. Fowler L. Ramsay K. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25534-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We named this class of PKC binding proteins/substrates STICKs (for substrates thatinteract with C-kinase. Studying the effects of PKC phosphorylation on STICK functions provides an avenue for understanding the mechanisms by which PKC regulates cell growth, death, and gene expression. In the present study, we demonstrated that clone 72, the major PKC-binding protein in REF52 cells, is phosphorylated by PKC at the same sites in vitroand in vivo. In other studies, we found that overexpressing certain PKCs increases clone 72 phosphorylation, whereas inhibiting PKC with bisindoylmaleimide I decreases clone 72 phosphorylation. 3H. M. Tobin, J. Cotton, Y. Li, J. Scott, and S. Jaken, manuscript in preparation. We conclude that PKC is a clone 72 kinase. The selective localization of phosphorylated clone 72 compared with total clone 72 indicates that phosphorylation occurs at discrete sites and may be either a consequence or an effector of localized actin remodeling involved in formation of membrane protrusions and ruffles. Clone 72 is related to gravin, which was also recently shown to be a PKC-binding protein in vitro (14Nauert J.B. Klauck T.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Gravin is >80% identical to clone 72 in the PKC binding domains/phosphorylation sites that we have identified in clone 72. Studies with gravin failed to detect any evidence for an in vivo complex formation between gravin and PKC (14Nauert J.B. Klauck T.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, since gravin is highly homologous to clone 72 in the PKC phosphorylation sites/binding domains, it seems likely that gravin is also a PKC substrate that associates (at least transiently) with PKC in vivo. Although a fragment of gravin was reported to inhibit PKC phosphorylation of an exogenous peptide substrate, since clone 72 and (by analogy) gravin are PKC substrates, it seems likely that emphasis should be placed on the role of clone 72 and gravin as PKC substrates rather than inhibitors. Mutational analysis was used in structure-function studies to define the PKC binding site in the fragment 3 region of clone 72. We found that the F506V and L511P mutants had decreased PS and PKC binding activity yet were improved PKC substrates due to an increase inVmax. These results lend support for the model proposed by Ohno et al. (23Fujise A. Mizuno K. Ueda Y. Osada S. Hirai S. Takayanagi A. Shimizu N. Owada M.K. Nakajima H. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31642-31648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to explain why MARCKS is a high affinity (low Km) yet slowly phosphorylated (lowVmax) PKC substrate. It is possible that high affinity interactions of PKC with substrates are accomplished at the expense of the rate of the phosphorylation reaction. For example, the decreased binding of the F506V and L511P mutants would facilitate dissociation of product and increase enzyme turnover. Given the high affinity of PKC for STICKs and the less than optimal phosphorylation efficiency, it is possible that PKC-STICK interactions are important for localizing PKC. In summary, these data provide additional evidence that PKC directly interacts with and phosphorylates a class of substrate proteins named STICKs. Thus, STICKs have two important activities: PKC binding partners and PKC substrates. Phosphorylation of certain STICKs, such as MARCKS and adducins, alters their functions with regard to association with cytoskeletal proteins and membranes (20Jaken S. Leach K. Klauck T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 21Wertz S.L. Savino Y. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11104-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, STICKs are also effectors of PKC activation. Additional studies of PKC-STICK interactions and phosphorylation-induced changes in STICK functions should provide new insight into the initial events in PKC activation that contribute to downstream effects on cell growth, transformation, and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1986573181,"The mammalian hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, a member of the C-type animal lectin family, displays preferential binding to N-acetylgalactosamine compared with galactose. The structural basis for selective binding toN-acetylgalactosamine has been investigated. Regions of the carbohydrate-recognition domain of the receptor believed to be important in preferential binding to N-acetylgalactosamine have been inserted into the homologous carbohydrate-recognition domain of a mannose-binding protein mutant that was previously altered to bind galactose. Introduction of a single histidine residue corresponding to residue 256 of the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor was found to cause a 14-fold increase in the relative affinity forN-acetylgalactosamine compared with galactose. The relative ability of various acyl derivatives of galactosamine to compete for binding to this modified carbohydrate-recognition domain suggest that it is a good model for the natural N-acetylgalactosamine binding site of the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Crystallographic analysis of this mutant carbohydrate-recognition domain in complex withN-acetylgalactosamine reveals a direct interaction between the inserted histidine residue and the methyl group of theN-acetyl substituent of the sugar. Evidence for the role of the side chain at position 208 of the receptor in positioning this key histidine residue was obtained from structural analysis and mutagenesis experiments. The corresponding serine residue in the modified carbohydrate-recognition domain of mannose-binding protein forms a hydrogen bond to the imidazole side chain. When this serine residue is changed to valine, loss in selectivity forN-acetylgalactosamine is observed. The structure of this mutant reveals that the β-branched valine side chain interacts directly with the histidine side chain, resulting in an altered imidazole ring orientation. The mammalian hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, a member of the C-type animal lectin family, displays preferential binding to N-acetylgalactosamine compared with galactose. The structural basis for selective binding toN-acetylgalactosamine has been investigated. Regions of the carbohydrate-recognition domain of the receptor believed to be important in preferential binding to N-acetylgalactosamine have been inserted into the homologous carbohydrate-recognition domain of a mannose-binding protein mutant that was previously altered to bind galactose. Introduction of a single histidine residue corresponding to residue 256 of the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor was found to cause a 14-fold increase in the relative affinity forN-acetylgalactosamine compared with galactose. The relative ability of various acyl derivatives of galactosamine to compete for binding to this modified carbohydrate-recognition domain suggest that it is a good model for the natural N-acetylgalactosamine binding site of the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Crystallographic analysis of this mutant carbohydrate-recognition domain in complex withN-acetylgalactosamine reveals a direct interaction between the inserted histidine residue and the methyl group of theN-acetyl substituent of the sugar. Evidence for the role of the side chain at position 208 of the receptor in positioning this key histidine residue was obtained from structural analysis and mutagenesis experiments. The corresponding serine residue in the modified carbohydrate-recognition domain of mannose-binding protein forms a hydrogen bond to the imidazole side chain. When this serine residue is changed to valine, loss in selectivity forN-acetylgalactosamine is observed. The structure of this mutant reveals that the β-branched valine side chain interacts directly with the histidine side chain, resulting in an altered imidazole ring orientation. The mammalian hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor is best known for its role in clearance of desialylated proteins from serum (1Spiess M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10009-10018Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 2Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The receptor is often regarded as a galactose-binding animal lectin because of its ability to bind galactose exposed when sialic acid is removed from complex N-linked oligosaccharides. However, the affinity of the receptor forN-acetylgalactosamine-terminated sugar structures and neoglycoproteins derivatized with this monosaccharide is substantially higher than for those terminating in galactose (3Sarkar M. Liao J. Kabat E. Tanabe T. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3170-3174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Connolly D.T. Townsend R.R. Kawaguchi K. Bell W.R. Lee Y.C. J. Biol.

In competition assays, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) 1The abbreviations used are: GalNAc,N-acetylgalactosamine; MBP, mannose-binding protein; RHL-1, rat hepatic lectin (major subunit of the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor); CRD, carbohydrate-recognition domain; QPDWG, mutant of MBP containing the sequence Gln-Pro-Asp-Asp-Trp-Tyr-Gly-His-Gly-Leu-Gly-Gly in place of residues 185 through 191; QDPWGH, mutant QPDWG with the additional change Thr202 → His; QPDWGHV, mutant QPDWGH with the additional change Ser154 → Val. 1The abbreviations used are: GalNAc,N-acetylgalactosamine; MBP, mannose-binding protein; RHL-1, rat hepatic lectin (major subunit of the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor); CRD, carbohydrate-recognition domain; QPDWG, mutant of MBP containing the sequence Gln-Pro-Asp-Asp-Trp-Tyr-Gly-His-Gly-Leu-Gly-Gly in place of residues 185 through 191; QDPWGH, mutant QPDWG with the additional change Thr202 → His; QPDWGHV, mutant QPDWGH with the additional change Ser154 → Val. competes approximately 60-fold more effectively than galactose (Gal) for binding to the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of the major subunit of the receptor (rat hepatic lectin 1, RHL-1). Interestingly, preferential binding of GalNAc is not a property of the asialoglycoprotein receptor of peritoneal and tumoricidal macrophages, even though the CRD of this receptor shares 85% sequence identity with RHL-1 (5Kawasaki T. Ii M. Kozutsumi Y. Yamashina I. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 151: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Sato M. Kawakami K. Osawa T. Toyoshima S. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The basis for the different behavior of the hepatic and macrophage asialoglycoprotein receptors has previously been investigated by studying a series of chimeric CRDs containing different portions of the two receptors (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This approach led to identification of three regions of the primary structure that contribute to selective binding of GalNAc. The position of the most significant of these regions relative to the monosaccharide binding site found in the three-dimensional structure of the homologous mannose-binding protein (MBP) CRD (8Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) suggests that these amino acids are unlikely to form direct contacts with the bound sugar. Instead, these residues probably influence the position of a critical histidine side chain (His256 in RHL-1), which could in turn contact the N-acetyl portion of the sugar. The importance of His256 for GalNAc selectivity was confirmed by mutagenesis (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Direct structural analysis of the CRD from an asialoglycoprotein receptor has not yet proven feasible. However, studies on mutant forms of the homologous mannose-binding CRD of rat serum mannose-binding protein suggest the likely arrangement of Gal and GalNAc in the binding site of the receptor. Insertion of three portions of RHL-1 into MBP results in a complete change in ligand-binding preference of this CRD from mannose to galactose (9Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant QPDWG, which contains the sequence Gln-Pro-Asp-Asp-Trp-Tyr-Gly-His-Gly-Leu-Gly-Gly in place of residues 185 through 191 of MBP, has binding properties almost indistinguishable from the asialoglycoprotein receptor when galactose and mannose are compared. Crystallographic analysis of galactose bound to the mutant CRD provides a model for the mode of galactose binding to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (10Kolatkar A.R. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6679-6685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These studies have now been extended by further mutagenesis of the CRD from MBP to mimic the selective binding of GalNAc by RHL-1. Structural analysis confirms the importance of the histidine corresponding to His256 of RHL-1 in directly contacting the bound ligand and provides additional evidence that other regions of RHL-1 that contribute to GalNAc binding may do so indirectly by influencing the position of this key histidine side chain. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides to replace restriction fragments of the cDNA for MBP following standard methods (11Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were prepared on an Applied Biosystems 391 DNA synthesizer. The CRDs derived from MBP were expressed in the pINIIIompA vector as described previously (9Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and those derived from RHL-1 were expressed in vector pT5T (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All of the CRDs were isolated by chromatography on galactose-Sepharose (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,12Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). N-propionyl andN-iso-butanoyl derivatives of galactosamine were prepared by reaction of the free amino sugar with propionic andiso-butyric anhydride (13Horton D. Mayer H. Montgomery R. Biochem. Prep. 1966; 11: 1-3Google Scholar). Thio derivatives were prepared as described previously (14Isecke R. Brossmer R. Tetrahedron. 1993; 49: 10009-10016Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The carboxypropionyl derivative was synthesized by reacting galactosamine hydrochloride with succinic anhydride. The detailed procedure will be published elsewhere. All derivatives were characterized using 1H-NMR spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy. Concentrations were determined using the Morgan-Elson assay (15Davidson E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 52-60Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar) following hydrolysis in 1m HCl for 3 h at 96 °C. Solid phase binding and competition assays were performed using 125I-Gal34-serum albumin as reporter ligand (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The KI values reported represent the point of half-maximal competition for binding as determined using a nonlinear least squares fitting program (SigmaPlot, Jandel Scientific). Proteins for NMR studies were further purified by reverse phase chromatography on a C3 ultrapore column (Beckman Instruments) using a gradient from 10 to 50% acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Eluted proteins were lyophilized and prepared for NMR analysis as in previous studies (16Iobst S.T. Wormald M.R. Weis W.I. Dwek R.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15505-15511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sugar was added in aliquots from concentrated stock solutions in D2O. Titrations were performed on a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer. Changes in chemical shift were fitted to a simple first order binding equation, Δδ = Δδbound/(KD + [sugar]), whereKD is the dissociation constant and Δδbound is the apparent change in chemical shift for the bound form. Protein prepared as described above was subjected to clostripain (Worthington Enzymes) digestion and repurified by affinity and reverse phase chromatography as described previously (17Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure ( Lond. ). 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Lyophilized protein was redissolved in 10 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2 to 10–20 mg/ml, and the pH was adjusted to 7 by addition of dilute sodium hydroxide. Crystals of QPDWGH and QPDWGHV were grown at 20 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion by mixing equal volumes of protein with reservoir solutions containing 12–15% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm CaCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3. Crystals typically grew in 5–7 days to a size of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm. Prior to data collection, the crystals were adapted in a stepwise manner to reservoir solution containing 0, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. The solutions all contained 200 mm GalNAc (Sigma) to form the monosaccharide complexes. Crystals were flash-cooled at 100 K, and diffraction data were measured on a RAXIS II imaging plate detector mounted on a rotating copper anode. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (18Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: “Data Collection and Processing”, 29–30 January 1993. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, United Kingdom1993: 56-62Google Scholar). Crystals of QPDWGH and QPDWGHV are nearly isomorphous with those of the galactose-binding MBP-A mutant QPDWG, with one trimer comprising the asymmetric unit (10Kolatkar A.R. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6679-6685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Structure solution consisted of rigid body refinement of the QPDWG mutant model against each of the data sets from QPDWGH and QPDWGHV. Water molecules, Ca2+ ions, and the side chain of residue 202 were omitted from the model for both data sets. Additionally, the side chain of residue 154 was omitted during the initial QPDWGHV refinement. Temperature factors from the QPDWG model were retained. The protomers were refined as individual rigid bodies against data from 10–4.0 Å and then from 10–2.8 Å. Positional and temperature factor refinement followed using data from 10–2.2 Å. Calcium atoms were added, and the omitted residues were built into the difference (Fo-Fc) electron density using the program O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Ser. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). From this point on, a maximum likelihood refinement target and all data from 30 Å to the high resolution limit were used (20Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Ser. A. 1996; 52: 659-668Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Water molecules were added, and positional and isotropic temperature factor refinement was carried out. A bulk solvent correction and an overall anisotropic temperature factor tensor were applied throughout. The GalNAc molecule was modeled only after the difference density allowed unambiguous positioning of the sugar ring. All calculations were performed using the program CNS (21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D.

The side chains of His99 and Met103 in protomer 1 were modeled in two conformations in QPDWGHV + GalNAc. As a complement to previous studies of the hepatic and macrophage asialoglycoprotein receptors (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), four regions of the hepatic receptor found to be important for selective binding of GalNAc were introduced into the CRD of MBP (Fig. 1). The starting point for these studies was a mutant CRD (QPDWG) already containing three regions from RHL-1, which are sufficient to establish high affinity binding to galactose (9Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the histidine at position 256 of RHL-1 is absolutely essential for highly selective binding of GalNAc, this residue (region 4) was introduced into the corresponding portion of mutant QPDWG in place of Thr202 to create mutant QPDWGH. The effect of this change was to increase by 14-fold the relative ability of GalNAc to compete for binding compared with Gal (TableIII). This result confirms the importance of this histidine residue in binding to GalNAc.Table IIIAnalysis of sugar binding to mutant forms of mannose-binding proteinName of mutantRegion 4Region 2Region 3Region 1KI,Gal/KI,GalNAcQPDWGThr202Lys182-Lys-Asp184Val204-Asp-Asn-Gly-Leu208Ser1540.6 ± 0.1QPDWGHHis202Lys182-Lys-Asp184Val204-Asp-Asn-Gly-Leu208Ser1548.0 ± 0.9QPDWGHVHis202Lys182-Lys-Asp184Val204-Asp-Asn-Gly-Leu208Val1543.2 ± 0.3His202Arg182-Pro-Gly184Val204-Asp-Asn-Gly-Leu208Ser1549.3 ± 1.0His202Arg182-Pro-Gly184Thr204-Thr-Asp-Gly-Leu208Ser1542.8 ± 0.3His202Arg182-Pro-Gly184Thr204-Thr-Asp-Gly-His208Ser1542.5 ± 0.5All mutants contain the sequence Gln185-Pro-Asp-Asp-Trp189 plus the inserted sequence Gly-His-Gly-Leu-Gly-Gly in place of residue Ser191 to establish high affinity galactose binding. Open table in a new tab All mutants contain the sequence Gln185-Pro-Asp-Asp-Trp189 plus the inserted sequence Gly-His-Gly-Leu-Gly-Gly in place of residue Ser191 to establish high affinity galactose binding. The higher affinity of the MBP derivative containing His202for GalNAc compared with Gal was independently verified using NMR to assess binding affinities directly. The affinities were determined by examining the perturbation of amino acid side chain resonances in the aromatic region of the one-dimensional proton NMR spectrum of the His202 mutant with increasing concentrations of sugar. The measured KD of 2.1 mm for Gal was comparable with that previously determined for the parental Thr202 mutant (16Iobst S.T. Wormald M.R. Weis W.I. Dwek R.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15505-15511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, similar analysis of GalNAc binding provided a KD value of 0.20 mm(Fig. 2). Thus, the NMR titrations provide independent evidence that the His202 mutant displays more than 10-fold higher affinity for GalNAc than for Gal. Examination of individual spectra obtained during the titration also provides information about the nature of the interaction between His202 and GalNAc. As shown in Fig.3, a well resolved resonance can be associated with H2 (Hε1) of the imidazole ring of this residue by comparison with the parental CRD. In the presence of increasing concentrations of sugar, the peak is largely unchanged, although there may be some broadening associated with immobilization at higher concentrations. However, it is difficult to quantify this effect because of increasing interference from the adjacent resonance that shifts upfield from 7.65 ppm with increasing sugar concentrations. Shifting of this adjacent resonance is also observed in both the parental and His202-containing CRDs titrated with galactose. In cases where sugar protons are positioned above aromatic amino acid side chains in sugar-lectin complexes, there is often a ring current-induced broadening and shifting of the resonances (22Perkins S.J. Dwek R.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). No such effects are observed for the methyl protons in the acetamido substituent of GalNAc in the presence of the His202-containing CRD. This result suggests that there is no direct stacking interaction with the face of the imidazole side chain of His202. Titration of the CRD from RHL-1 similarly fails to show broadening of this resonance (data not shown), providing further evidence for the similarity of the interaction of RHL-1 and the MBP mutant with GalNAc. The crystal structure of QPDWGH complexed with GalNAc was determined. The structure is essentially superimposable with the original QPDWG structure. The Thr202 → His mutation produces significant changes only at the His202 and Ser154 side chain positions (Fig. 4). The hydroxyl group of Ser154 in QPDWGH swings about the χ1angle by 120° relative to its orientation in QPDWG and forms a hydrogen bond with His202. The orientation of His202 confirms that the increase in GalNAc specificity of this mutant results from a direct interaction between this residue and GalNAc. The imidazole ring is oriented so that the methyl group in the acetamido substituent of GalNAc makes van der Waals contact with Nε2 and Cε1 of His202 (Fig. 5). The contact distances between the acetamido carbon atom and the Nε2 and Cε1 atoms are 3.9 ± 0.2 and 3.9 ± 0.1 Å, respectively (averaged over the three copies in the trimer), and compare favorably with the expected van der Waals distance between two carbon atoms or between a carbon and a nitrogen atom.Figure 5van der Waals dot surface representation of the GalNAc binding site of the QPDWGH mutant of MBP. Stereo pair shows the GalNAc binding site in an orientation very similar to that in Fig. 4. The His202/GalNAc contact is apparent at the bottom. The stacking of the glycine-rich loop, Trp189 ring, and the apolar face of GalNAc is seen at the top. This figure was prepared with the Xfit component of the XtalView program suite (24McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies with a macrophage galactose receptor mutant that exhibits more than 20-fold enhanced binding of GalNAc compared with Gal have indicated that histidine at the position corresponding to His256 of RHL-1 has a unique ability to support preferential binding of GalNAc (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This residue has been mutated to a variety of different amino acids. Substitution of either alanine or glutamine at this position reduces preferential binding of GalNAc over Gal to less than 2-fold, whereas changes to asparagine, tyrosine, aspartic acid, and lysine actually result in lower affinity for GalNAc than for Gal. Glutamine, which is similar in length to histidine and contains amide and carbonyl oxygen functionalities, does not produce strong GalNAc selectivity, suggesting that hydrogen bonding is not involved and that the presence of Cε1 is essential. Of the amino acids tested, glutamic acid comes closest to histidine, because it supports 4-fold tighter binding of GalNAc than Gal. The unique ability of histidine to elicit strong GalNAc selectivity can be explained by the fact that none of the other amino acids is isosteric with histidine and thus cannot form the favorable van der Waals contacts with the GalNAc acetamido group. Among the three other regions of RHL-1 that affect GalNAc binding (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), region 1 shows the largest effect but is somewhat unusual in that most amino acids at position 208 of the hepatic receptor support selective binding to GalNAc. The major exception is valine, which is found at the corresponding position in the macrophage receptor. This substitution is primarily responsible for the different binding properties of the hepatic and macrophage receptors. The tolerance of this position for a wide range of side chains other than valine suggests that the effect of the valine might reflect alterations in the positions of other side chains, particularly His256 in region 4, caused by the presence of a β-branched amino acid in region 1. To provide evidence for this interpretation of the role of region 1, a further mutation in RHL-1 was created by substitution of isoleucine at position 208. This change results in substantial loss of affinity for GalNAc, because the KI, Gal/KI, GalNAc for this mutant is 1.9 ± 0.1. This value can be compared with 1.2 ± 0.1 in the presence of Val208 and 60 ± 8 in the presence of Asn208 (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Combined with previous studies introducing various amino acid substitutions into region 1 of the macrophage galactose receptor, this result provides support for the suggestion that the presence of a β-branched amino acid at the position of Asn208 in RHL-1 leads to loss of affinity for GalNAc. Threonine also has a β-substituent, but unlike valine and isoleucine, it has a hydroxyl group that could hydrogen bond to His202in a manner similar to that seen for Ser154 in QPDWGH. The possibility that the corresponding portion of MBP might similarly influence the binding of GalNAc to QPDWGH, perhaps by affecting the position of the histidine side chain, was investigated by insertion of valine in place of the residue that most nearly corresponds to Asn208 of RHL-1. The alignment of amino acid sequences shown in Fig. 1 suggests that there are some differences in the conformation of this region of the protein, because the segment connecting α-helix 2 and β-strand 2 in MBP is 1 residue shorter than the corresponding segment of RHL-1. However, Ser154 of MBP, at the beginning of β-strand 2, appears to correspond most closely to Asn208 of RHL-1. Changing this residue to valine to create mutant QPDWGHV results in a 3-fold loss of preferential binding of GalNAc (Table III). This finding is consistent with the suggestion that amino acid side chains in region 1 influence the ability of the histidine residue in region 4 to mediate higher affinity binding to GalNAc. The crystal structure of the His202/Val154mutant (QPDWGHV) was determined to probe the structural basis of the effect of Val154 on GalNAc selectivity (Fig.6 A). In this mutant, the β-methyl substituent of Val154 makes van der Waals contact with the Cγ, Nδ1, and Cε1 atoms of the His202imidazole ring, which rotates about its χ2 torsion angle by 25° to accommodate the Val154 β-methyl group (Fig.6 B). Despite this rotation, the imidazole ring of His202 is still able to make van der Waals contact with the GalNAc acetamido group (lines in Fig. 6 A). These findings are consistent with the observation that although the specificity of QPDWGHV for GalNAc is reduced 3-fold (Table III), the presence of Val154 does not completely abolish GalNAc selectivity. The basis of the reduced preference for GalNAc is unclear, because the van der Waals contact distances between GalNAc and His202 are not significantly altered when Ser154 is mutated to valine. Given the difference in the length of segments connecting α-helix 2 to β-strand 2 in MBP and RHL-1, it is possible that valine at position 208 in RHL-1 clashes more severely with His256, resulting in a larger displacement of the imidazole ring than that observed in QPDWGHV. Incorporation of two additional regions of RHL-1 into the macrophage receptor increases the relative effectiveness of GalNAc as a competitor for binding by roughly 3-fold (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The introduction of regions 2 and 3 (Fig. 1) into MBP does not result in significantly increased selectivity for GalNAc (Table III). In fact, some loss in selectivity is observed in the presence of either a short or long version of region 3. This loss of affinity for GalNAc may reflect an indirect effect on the essential His202 in region 4, which is immediately adjacent in the amino acid sequence. The lack of positive effects from inclusion of regions 2 and 3 suggests that these portions of the MBP mutants do not assume conformations that accurately mirror the corresponding segment of the RHL-1. Alternatively, they may have indirect effects in RHL-1 that are mediated by residues not present in MBP. To compare the selectivity of the binding site in authentic RHL-1 with QPDWGH in region 4, the abilities of different N-acylated derivatives of galactosamine to compete for binding were assessed. The results for the two proteins are summarized in TableIV. The data for thio derivatives of theN-acetyl and N-propionyl substituents reflect the same relative preferences for side chain size previously observed for a series of simple N-acyl derivatives (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, the derivative with the larger thioacetyl substituent competes for binding to RHL-1 more effectively than does GalNAc and appears to bind at least as well as N-propionyl galactosamine. However, the thiopropionyl derivative, like the n-butanoyl derivative, binds less well than the N-propionyl derivative. These results define an optimal size for the 2-substituent in line with previous studies (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The change of oxygen to sulfur in the acyl substituent has approximately the same effect as addition of a carbon atom. Steric effects could also explain why the still larger carboxypropionyl derivative is the least effective inhibitor, although it is possible that the negative charge adversely affects the interaction of this ligand with the protein.Table IVBinding of acylated derivatives of galactosamine to CRDsRHL-1 wild typeMBP mutant QPDWGHKI,GalNAc/KI,GalNPr7.7 ± 2.41.2 ± 0.2KI,GalNAc/KI,GalNnBu3.4 ± 0.7—aNot available.KI,GalNAc/KI,GalNiBu1.2 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.1KI,GalNAc/KI,GalNSAc9.3 ± 1.68.7 ± 0.5KI,GalNAc/KI,GalNSPr5.4 ± 1.84.4 ± 0.4KI,GalNAc/KI,GalNCPr0.4 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.1The first three values in column 1 are recalculated from Ref. 7Iobst S.T.

Ac, acetyl; Pr, propionyl; nBu, n-butanoyl; iBu,iso-butanoyl; SAc, thioacetyl; SPr, thiopropionyl; CPr, 3-carboxy propionyl. When the same derivatives were tested with the His202mutant of MBP, similar effects of size were observed. The thio derivatives show enhanced binding to the mutant MBP that closely parallels that observed for the natural RHL-1 binding site, whereas the carboxypropionyl derivative is again less effective. These comparisons provide evidence that the mutant MBP displays a restricted binding site for the 2-acylamido substituent of the ligand. The properties of this binding site are therefore similar to, although not exactly like, those of RHL-1. The apparently higher affinity of the propionyl derivative for RHL-1 is not observed in the modified MBP, indicating that the favorable interactions resulting from the presence of this intermediate-sized side chain must involve regions of RHL-1 that have not been incorporated into the MBP framework. However, theN-iso-butanoyl derivative is considerably less effective than the N-propionyl derivative as a competitor for binding to both QPDWGH and RHL-1. These results suggest that the larger group clashes with portions of QPDWGH, thereby limiting the size of the substituent that can be tolerated in a manner similar to RHL-1. Modeling suggests that although the N-propionyl derivative can be accommodated in the QPDWGH sugar- binding site, one of the terminal methyl groups of the larger N-iso-butanoyl derivative would clash with His202 and Asn210. It is possible to model a N-iso-butanoyl rotamer such that there are no steric clashes, but there would be an entropic cost to restricting the rotation of the butanoyl group. In the propionyl derivative, this methyl group would be absent and no unfavorable contacts would be expected, which is consistent with the binding data. Several lines of evidence suggest that the modified GalNAc-binding CRD in mutant QPDWGH provides a useful model for the structure of the GalNAc-selective binding site in RHL-1. The preferential binding of GalNAc compared with Gal and the relative selectivity of the model CRD for different N-acyl derivatives parallels qualitatively if not quantitatively the natural GalNAc-binding CRDs. In addition, the absolute dependence on a histidine residue in region 4 combined with the absence of evidence of an aromatic stacking interaction with theN-acetyl group of GalNAc indicate that the molecular interactions which stabilize GalNAc in the binding site are similar in the two cases. The nature of this interaction is evident from the crystallographic analysis of the QPDWGH mutant. The increase in GalNAc selectivity in the mutant is the result of a direct van der Waals contact between the critical histidine and GalNAc. Furthermore, a nearby valine in the QPDWGHV mutant has been shown to influence this interaction because its β-methyl substituent directly alters the orientation of the histidine imidazole ring. Taken together, these results explain the ability of RHL-1 to bind GalNAc preferentially over Gal because of the presence of a histidine residue at position 256 and the fact that Asn208 lacks a β substituent. In the macrophage galactose receptor, which also contains the critical histidine residue, a valine residue is present at the position corresponding to Asn208in RHL-1. The β-methyl group of this valine residue likely perturbs the ring orientation of the critical histidine residue and its van der Waals contact to GalNAc, leading to a substantial loss of GalNAc selectivity. However, the QPDWGHV mutant data cannot completely explain the loss of GalNAc selectivity in the macrophage receptor because, unlike the receptor, the mutant still exhibits 3-fold selectivity for GalNAc over Gal (Table III). The structure of this region of the protein may differ between MBP and RHL-1, or other regions of the receptor that have not been incorporated into the QPDWGHV mutant are required to eliminate GalNAc selectivity completely. The preferential binding of acyl derivatives of certain sizes suggests the presence of a binding cleft that accommodates the 2-substituent of the ligand; greater stability is achieved up to a certain size, probably because of additional interactions between protein and ligand, but still larger side chains result in steric clashes that reduce affinity. The binding and NMR data provide some insight into the nature of the interactions that define this site. The fact that the thioacetyl derivative binds with higher affinity than the acetyl derivative argues against the presence of a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen in the GalNAc complex, because sulfur would be expected to be a weaker hydrogen bond acceptor than oxygen in this position. Combined with the NMR and crystallographic evidence that the binding does not involve packing of the methyl portion of the acetyl group against the face of the histidine or any other aromatic residue, these data indicate that the predominant interactions defining the binding cleft for the 2-substituent are simple van der Waals contacts with the edge of a histidine ring.

Using NIH3T3 cells expressing constitutively active protein kinase B/akt (PKB/akt) or kinase-dead PKB/akt, we show that PKB/akt mediates the stimulatory effect of Ras on endocytosis. Fluid phase endocytosis of horseradish peroxidase in cells expressing the constitutively active form of PKB/akt was elevated and insensitive to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors. However, expression of dominant negative Rab5:N34 blocked endocytosis in cells expressing the constitutively active form of PKB/akt.Transient expression of either Rab5:wt or Rab5:L79, a GTPase deficient mutant of Rab5, in cells expressing constitutively activated PKB/akt further increased endocytic rate. However, in cells expressing kinase-dead PKB/akt, endocytic rate was not affected by transient expression of Rab5:wt. Rab5:L79, on the other hand, increased endocytosis in cells expressing kinase-dead PKB/akt. Similar results were obtained using an in vitro endosome fusion reconstitution assay with cytosol prepared from cells expressing the activated PKB/akt or kinase-dead PKB/akt. Both Rab5:wt and Rab5:L79 stimulated endosome fusion when assayed in cytosol containing the activated PKB/akt, whereas only Rab5:L79 activated fusion when the assay utilized cytosol from kinase-dead expressing cells.

Twenty-four h after withdrawal of serum, NIH3T3 cell monolayers in 35-mm dishes were washed three times with serum-free α-MEM, and HRP endocytosis was initiated by addition of 1 ml of α-MEM containing 2 mg/ml HRP and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at 37 °C. To estimate HRP uptake, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsinized on ice for 20 min, washed two times with PBS, and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (3Li G.

To determine protein kinase B/akt activity, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin).

To determine the ratio of GTP to GDP bound to Rab5 (GTP/GDP ratio), confluent (∼5 × 105 cells/dish) NIH3T3 control cells and NIH3T3 expressing constitutively active PKB/akt or kinase-dead PKB/akt were incubated in α-MEM phosphate-free medium for 3 h with 300 μCi of 32Pi (200 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After incubation, the cells were lysed as described (19Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.I. Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Golemis E.A. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell.

The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) and three times with wash buffer containing 0.001% SDS. The bound nucleotides were then eluted in 12 μl of buffer (10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% SDS, 5 mmGDP, 5 mm GTP) for 3 min at 65 °C. All the manipulations, from lysis of the sample to elution of the nucleotides bound to Rab5, were carried out at 4 °C within 40 min. Four-μl samples were then spotted onto 0.1 mm polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC (Merck) plates, which were developed for 60 min in 0.75 mphosphate, pH 3.4. The samples were dried and placed in autoradiography cassettes. For visualization of the32Pi-labeled GTP and GDP, films were exposed at −80 °C for 24–36 h. A phosphoimager was used to determine the GTP/GDP ratio. To examine endocytosis in cells expressing constitutively activated or kinase-dead PKB/akt, cells were starved for serum overnight prior to initiating endocytosis assays or transiently expressing Ras or Rab5 constructs. As shown in Fig.1 A, transient expression of Ras:V12 in control cells results in enhanced endocytosis of HRP, a fluid phase endocytosis marker. Expression of Ras:N17, the dominant negative mutant, modestly reduced endocytosis (Fig. 1 A). Ras is known to interact with multiple target molecules via its effector domain, including the 110-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (21Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by Ras:V12 results in increased production of several lipid products. These include phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, which are thought to activate, directly or indirectly, several downstream effectors such as p70 S6 kinase, Rac1, PKC, RalB, and PKB/akt (21Rodriguez-Viciana P.

To establish a connection between elevated endocytosis observed following activation of the Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and the activation of PKB/akt, a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, we asked whether activation of PKB/akt was directly coupled to endocytosis.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Cells expressing constitutively active PKB/akt demonstrated substantially higher endocytic rates (Fig. 1 A), which were similar to the elevated levels observed following expression of Ras:V12 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, cells expressing the kinase-dead construct of PKB/akt (Fig. 1 A) showed depressed levels of HRP uptake. To explore the linkage between Ras and PKB/akt, cells were infected with Sindbis virus encoding Ras:V12 and Ras:N17. Overexpression of either activated or dominant negative Ras in cells expressing kinase-dead PKB/akt had no effect on HRP endocytosis, suggesting that activation of PKB/akt is required for Ras stimulation of endocytosis. Moreover, transient expression of either Ras construct (Ras:V12 or Ras:N17) in cells expressing constitutively active PKB/akt had no effect on endocytosis (Fig. 1 A). These data suggest that activation of PKB/akt is linked to Ras stimulation of endocytosis and that PKB/akt lies downstream of Ras. Consistent with this proposal, expression of dominant negative Ras:N17 was unable to block the enhanced endocytic rate observed in cells expressing the constitutively active PKB/akt (Fig. 1 A). Ras:V12-stimulated endocytosis is inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (3Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we found that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 completely inhibited the activation of PKB/akt by Ras:V12 in NIH3T3 cells and substantially reduced the endocytic response (data not shown). The time course of HRP endocytosis in control cells and in cells expressing constitutively active PKB/akt and kinase-dead PKB/akt is shown in Fig. 1 B. Constitutively active PKB/akt enhanced both the rate of internalization and the accumulation of internalized HRP. In cells expressing the constitutively active PKB/akt, wortmannin had no effect on endocytosis of HRP (Fig. 1 C). This result is consistent with the observation that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors had no effect on the activity of activated PKB/akt. 2M. A. Barbieri, R. Roth, and P. D. Stahl, unpublished observations. These results clearly indicate that PKB/akt is a downstream effector of the Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and a key regulator of endocytosis. Following the internalization step at the plasma membrane, endocytic vesicles access the early endocytic sorting compartment by fusion, a process that is regulated by the GTPase Rab5 (2Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Rab5 is rate-limiting for endocytosis and for endosome fusion reconstituted in vitro (2Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18720-18722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that elevated endocytosis following overexpression of Rab5 is dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (3Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase appears to be required for the activation of Rab5, because enhanced endocytosis following expression of Rab5:L79, the GTPase-defective mutant, was unaffected by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (3Li G.

Similar results have been obtained with the in vitroendosome fusion assay (3Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 4Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Cooper J.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

The insensitivity of Rab5:Q79L-induced endocytosis to inhibitors of PI 3-kinase following transient expression in cultured cells is confirmed in Fig.2 A. However, recent work by Jones et al. (31Jones A.T. Mills I.G. Scheidig A.J. Alexandrov K. Clague M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) indicates that under some circumstances, the sensitivity of Rab5:Q79L-induced in vitro endosome fusion to wortmannin is substantially reduced, suggesting that PI 3-kinase and guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab5 may not be in a linear pathway. However, the in vitro assay employed by Joneset al. (31Jones A.T. Mills I.G. Scheidig A.J. Alexandrov K. Clague M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) varied substantially from that used in the initial report (3Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), which showed that stimulation of fusion with Rab5:Q79L was wortmannin-insensitive. Clearly, more work will be needed to sort out the relationship between PI 3-kinase and activation of Rab5. To address whether the stimulation of endocytosis by PKB/akt requires Rab5 activity, we examined the effect of Rab5:wt and Rab5 mutants on HRP uptake in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2 A) overexpressing constitutively active PKB/akt (Fig. 2 B) or kinase-dead PKB/akt (Fig. 2 C). Confluent NIH3T3 cell monolayers were infected with recombinant Sindbis viruses encoding Rab5:wt, Rab5:N34, or Rab5:L79 or the Sindbis vector as a control. At 4 h postinfection, cells were treated with LY294002, and HRP uptake was assayed. As expected, the overexpression of Rab5:wt and Rab5:L79 in NIH3T3 cells induced a significant increase in HRP uptake (Fig. 2 A). Both expression of Rab5:N34, the dominant negative mutant (data not shown), and the addition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (LY294002) blocked Rab5:wt-stimulated and basal HRP uptake (Fig. 2 A). However, in cells expressing constitutively active PKB/akt (Fig. 2 B) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors had no effect on the activation of endocytosis following expression of either Rab5:wt or Rab5:L79. Expression of Rab5:N34, the dominant negative mutant, significantly blocked HRP uptake (data not shown). In NIH3T3 cells expressing kinase-ead PKB/akt, Rab5:wt was unable to stimulate HRP uptake, when overexpressed with the Sindbis expression vector (Fig.2 C). Rab5:L79, on the other hand, was fully active when expressed in cells stably expressing kinase-ead PKB/akt (Fig.2 C). Thus, it appears that an active PKB/akt is required for Rab5:wt to produce its effects on endocytosis. Rab5 is active in the GTP form. To address whether the expression of active and kinase-dead forms of PKB/akt affects the guanine nucleotide status of Rab5, we determined the ratio of GTP and GDP bound to Rab5 in control cells and in cells expressing the constitutively active PKB/akt or kinase-dead PKB/akt. As shown in Fig. 2 D, cells were labeled with32Pi for 3 h, after which the cells were lysed, and Rab5 was immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In Fig. 2 D, we show that a significant increase in the GTP-bound to Rab5 in cells expressing the constitutively active PKB/akt and a decrease in GTP bound to Rab5 in cells expressing the kinase-dead PKB/akt. These observations are consistent with the fact that the Rab5 dominant negative mutant (Rab5:N34) blocked endocytosis in cells expressing constitutively active PKB/akt (Fig. 2 B). Given the inhibitory effect of the kinase-dead PKB/akt mutant on HRP uptake and the insensitivity of the constitutively active PKB/akt to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, our results suggested a direct involvement of PKB/akt in endocytosis. To confirm these observations, we took advantage of the in vitro endosome fusion by testing directly whether cytosol prepared from cells overexpressing constitutively active PKB/akt or kinase-dead PKB/akt would support fusion. Early endosomes, prepared from J774 E-clone macrophages, were loaded with aggregated monoclonal anti-DNP mouse IgG (via the Fc receptor) or with DNP-β-glucuronidase (via the mannose receptor) as described (15Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endosomes were incubated with cytosol from control NIH3T3 cells or cells expressing constitutively active PKB/akt or kinase-dead PKB/akt. Endosome fusion with cytosol from cells expressing the constitutively active PKB/akt was elevated compared with control cytosol. However, unlike control cytosol, the endosome fusion with cytosol from cells expressing constitutively active PKB/akt was wortmannin-insensitive (Fig.3 A). Cytosol from cells expressing kinase-dead PKB/akt was poorly active in the in vitro assay (Fig. 3 A). PKB/akt-enriched cytosol-stimulated endosome fusion had all the requirements of the standard endosome fusion assay (e.g. ATP, temperature). Importantly, PKB/akt-stimulated endosome fusion was blocked by the Rab5:N34 mutant (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, the addition of Rab5:L79, but not Rab5:wt, to cytosol containing kinase-dead PKB/akt substantially stimulated endosome fusion (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, these data suggest that Ras regulates endocytosis via PKB/akt and Rab5 and that the target PKB/akt action is probably guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab5. Ras is reported to have a variable effect on PKB/akt activation by growth factors. In some cases, dominant negative Ras has been found to block growth factor-induced stimulation of PKB/akt, whereas in others, such effects have not been reported (6Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1994; 376: 599-602Crossref Scopus (1884) Google Scholar,7Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). This probably reflects the complexity of the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which is controlled by multiple signaling pathways (8Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 9Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the closely related protein R-Ras can stimulate both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and PKB/akt without affecting the well characterized Ras target, Raf (8Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 9Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of PKB/akt may ensure tight regulation of Rab5 function, possibly via guanine nucleotide exchange at the correct membrane localization site during the endocytic cycle to coordinate the assembly and function of macromolecular complexes necessary for endosome fusion.

https://openalex.org/W2028587304,"HEK2 belongs to the family of EPH-related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) which are involved in axonal pathfinding and the formation of the embryonic body plan. The knowledge about intracellular pathways of signal transduction mediated by EPH-related receptors is still limited. Many of the known key players of cellular signalling contain Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which recognize phosphotyrosine motifs in RTKs. Thus, we examined the interactions of various SH2-containing molecules like PLC-γ1, rasGAP, p85 subunit of PI3-kinase, Src, Fyn, Crk, Nck, Grb2 and Shc with HEK2 using in vitro binding assays, immunoprecipitations and yeast Two-Hybrid assays. We found that rasGAP, Crk and Fyn bind in a SH2-dependent manner to autophosphorylated HEK2. rasGAP, which contains two SH2- and one SH3-domain, was shown to associate with its N-terminal SH2-domain to HEK2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a single amino acid substitution (Y614F) clearly reduces the phosphotyrosine content of HEK2 and abrogates its ability to bind rasGAP, Crk and Fyn indicating that this residue functions as major phosphorylation and multi-docking site. The conservation of this predicted binding site among various EPH-related RTKs provides evidence that Fyn, Crk and rasGAP are key players in signal transduction of at least a subset of these receptors."

A point mutation in the extracellular domain of β1A (D130A) was introduced as follows. cDNA for β1A was excised withXbaI and Acc65I from pBSβ1A (38Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and cloned into pGEM-7Zf. The mutant was generated by oligonucleotide-primed DNA synthesis using a mutagenesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The region spanning the HindIII and ClaI sites was analyzed by DNA sequence analysis, and the correctly mutagenized HindIII-ClaI fragment was isolated and ligated intoHindIII-ClaI-digested pGEM-7Zf containing the original XbaI-BglII fragment of β1A. The XbaI-NcoI fragment was then excised and ligated into XbaI-NcoI-digested pBSβ1A, yielding cDNA encoding full-length β1A polypeptide containing the point mutation. The plasmid was linearized with XbaI and transfected into GD25 cells by electroporation. Clones stably expressing mutant β1A were obtained with the selection by puromycin and analyzed for expression of β1A by flow cytometry (36Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The population of higher expressing cells in several clones was selected by fluorescence-detected cell sorting and expanded. By flow cytometry, the cells selected for study expressed mutant cell-surface β1A at comparable levels with cells expressing wild type β1A. Wild type β1A was expressed in GD10 cells by transfecting with pBSβ1A using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell migration assays were performed in modified Boyden chambers containing Nucleopore polycarbonate membranes (5-μm pore size; Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) as described previously (36Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The filters were soaked overnight in a 10 μg/ml solution of vitronectin, fibronectin, or laminin-1 or 100 μg/ml gelatin, briefly rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), air-dried, and then placed in the chamber. PDGF from porcine platelets (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) or 1-oleoyl-LPA (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA was added to the lower (and/or upper) compartment of the chambers. Cells suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA were introduced into the upper compartment. The chambers were then incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. The filters were fixed and stained, and the cells that had migrated to the lower surface were counted at × 400 magnification. In each experiment, two areas from each of two wells were counted. Values are the mean ± S.D. of cells per 0.16-mm2 field. Total RNA was isolated using total RNA isolation system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). RT-PCR was performed on Perkin-Elmer 480 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) using the Access RT-PCR system (Promega Corp.) as described elsewhere. 2O. Peyruchaud and D. F.

The specific primers used were based upon human cDNA sequence: 5′-AATCGAGAGGCACATTACGG-3′ (nucleotide 429–448) and 5′-TGTGGACAGCACACGTCTAG-3′ (nucleotide 857–838) for edg-2 (28Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A.

Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed as described previously elsewhere (39Sakai T. Kawakatsu H. Furukawa Y. Saito M. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. Briefly, cells grown to 80–90% confluence were starved in medium without serum for 16 h and then stimulated with agonists for 5 min or left unstimulated. The cells were then lysed on ice in buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm sodium fluoride,1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm sodium molybdate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.4 mm pefabloc SC, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 r.p.m. The same amounts of protein from different experimental samples were used for analyses, as determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). The supernatants were precleaned with protein A-Sepharose 4 fast-flow (Pharmacia LKB Bio-tech, Uppsala, Sweden) and subsequently incubated with antibody. The complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose 4 fast-flow, and the proteins were eluted from the resins by incubation with SDS-sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For immunoblotting, the blots were probed with the primary antibody, then with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Organon Teknika Corp., Westchester, PA). Immunoreactive bands were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate system (NEN Life Science Products). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognized mouse EGF and PDGF receptors were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (mAb 4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Human recombinant EGF was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. GD25 and GD10 cells were differentiated from β1-null embryonic stem cells and are of uncertain lineage. We used RT-PCR to check the expression ofvzg-1/edg-2 and edg-1, which have been identified as receptors for LPA and sphingosine 1-phosphate, respectively (28Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J.

GD25 and GD10 cells lacking β1A, and GD25 and GD10 cells expressing wild type β1A, were found to express vzg-1/edg-2 LPA-specific receptor (Fig. 1). The relatededg-1 receptor was also expressed by these cells (Fig.1). The effects of β1A integrin on LPA-induced cell migration through gelatin-coated filters were analyzed. GD25 cells lacking β1A migrated very little when LPA (500 nm) was added to the lower compartment (Fig.2 A and TableI). GD25 cells expressing wild type β1A migrated 10-fold more than nontransfected GD25 cells in response to LPA. GD25 cells and GD25 cells expressing β1A migrated equally well in response to PDGF (Table I). GD10 cells and GD10 cells expressing wild type β1A behaved similarly to the GD25 counterparts (Table I). Thus, β1-null fibroblasts demonstrate a profound defect in migration through gelatin-coated filters in response to LPA that is not because of an intrinsic inability to migrate through the gelatin-coated pores.Table IEffect of LPA or PDGF on cell migration through gelatin-coated filtersChemoattractantβ1-Nullβ1A-transfectedGD25GD10β1GD25β1GD10cells/0.16 mm2cells/0.16 mm2None<10<10<10<10LPA (500 nm)17 ± 239 ± 5172 ± 13230 ± 12PDGF (30 ng/ml)79 ± 1885 ± 977 ± 1496 ± 14Cells and chemotactic agents were added to the upper and lower compartments, respectively.

Numbers represent the mean ± S.D. of at least four determinations. Cells expressing mutant β1As were tested for an ability to migrate in response to LPA. The mutations in the cytoplasmic domain fell into two groups, active (D759A; Y783F; Y795F; Y783,795F) and inactive (T788P; P781,793A), based upon the reactivity of expressing cells with anti-β1 (9EG7) antibody, α6β1-dependent adhesion to laminin-1, and ability to support fibronectin assembly (36Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). T788P or P781,793A cells, which express inactive β1As, migrated much less in response to LPA through gelatin-coated filters than cells expressing wild type β1A (Fig. 2 B). D130A cells, carrying a point mutation of extracellular domain of β1A known to impair ligand binding (40Takada Y. Ylanne J. Mandelman D. Puzon W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), also showed less ability to migrate. In contrast, cells expressing β1A with an activating D759A mutation of conserved aspartate in the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain migrated 9-fold more than GD25 cells lacking β1A and equivalently to the cells expressing wild type β1A. Although mutation of one or both of the tyrosines in the two NPXY motifs (Tyr783, Tyr795) to phenylalanines results in active β1A as assessed by adhesion to laminin-1 and reactivity with the 9EG7 antibody (36Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), Y795F or Y783,785F cells migrated much less than cells expressing wild type β1A and no more than GD25 cells lacking β1A (Fig. 2 B). Y783F cells showed intermediate migratory behavior between GD25 cells lacking β1A and expressing wild type β1A. Expression of β1A in GD25 cells enhances haptotactic migration through filters coated with vitronectin, fibronectin, or laminin-1 as well as migration through such filters in response to PDGF or EGF (36Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Migration of cells expressing wild type β1A through vitronectin-, fibronectin-, or laminin-1-coated filters in response to LPA was greater than migration through gelatin-coated filters (compare Table I and Fig.3 A). In response to LPA, GD25 cells expressing β1A migrated 5-fold (on vitronectin) or 6-fold (on fibronectin) more than cells lacking β1A and 10-fold (on vitronectin) or 3.5-fold (on fibronectin) more than the haptotactic responses in the absence of LPA (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that the participation of β1A integrins in cell-matrix interactions synergizes with the response to LPA. LPA-induced migration through laminin-1-coated filters required expression of β1A (Fig. 3 A), as is also the case for EGF- or PDGF-induced migration (36Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Migration of cells expressing wild type β1A was half-maximal in response to approximately 50 nm LPA through all the adhesive substrates (Fig. 3 A). Migration of cells expressing the cytoplasmic D759A mutation was somewhat less than that of cells expressing wild type β1A (Fig. 3 B). Y783,795F cells migrated much less, nearly equivalent to GD25 cells lacking β1A. Y783F and Y795F cells had migratory behavior that was intermediate between Y783,795F cells and cells expressing wild type β1A (Fig. 3 B). D130A cells also had an impaired migratory response through filters coated with fibronectin, vitronectin, or laminin-1 (not shown). Previous studies suggested that LPA causes random, nondirectional migration (chemokinesis) rather than chemotaxis of Rat1 fibroblasts (27Anand-Apte B. Zetter B.R. Viswanathan A. Qiu R-G. Chen J. Ruggieri R. Symons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30688-30692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Checkerboard analysis in which different concentrations of chemoattractant were added to the upper and lower chamber of the apparatus was therefore carried out to characterize the effect of LPA on cell migration by derivatives of GD25 cells (Fig. 4). Such an analysis differentiates directed migration across the filter in response to the gradient of chemoattractant (chemotaxis) from increased random motility because of the presence of the chemoattractant per se(chemokinesis). Cells expressing wild type β1A, the D759A mutant, or the Y783F mutant displayed directional motility in a LPA gradient, although there were substantial increases in random motility when LPA was present at equal concentrations in both chambers: the chemotactic responses were 1.2–1.5-fold greater than the chemokinetic responses. Migration of Y795F cells was greater when LPA was present in both chambers than when there was a gradient of LPA, indicating that the main effect was a chemokinetic response. Migration of Y783,795F cells or nontransfected GD25 cells was too low to classify responses as chemotaxis or chemokinesis. Signaling pathways initiated by high concentration of LPA (10–25 μm) are known to “cross-talk” with EGF signaling pathways to cause phosphorylation of the EGF receptors (41Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 42Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Because GD25 cells are also deficient in migration in response to EGF or PDGF (36Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we checked the presence of EGF and PDGF receptors in GD25 cells and GD25 cells expressing β1A. Lysates of both cells contained comparable amounts of both receptors when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (not shown). As assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated receptors, both receptors in both cells were activated appropriately by concentrations of 3 ng/ml EGF or PDGF but not by 500 nm LPA that caused migration (not shown). We previously found that β1A with an intact cytoplasmic tail, including intact NPXY motifs, is important for optimal chemotaxis of GD25 fibroblasts through filters coated with vitronectin, fibronectin, or laminin-1 in response to PDGF or EGF (36Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The purposes of the present studies were to learn if GD25 cells or its derivatives migrate in response to LPA and then to compare and contrast LPA-induced migration to that induced by PDGF or EGF. The fact that the extracellular D130A mutation ablated ability of β1A to support migration through filters coated with fibronectin or vitronectin indicates that β1 integrins must be able to interact with extracellular ligands. However, which integrins are responsible for migration on the various coated filters is open to question, with the exception of laminin-1, to which adhesion of β1A-expressing GD25 cells is blocked by anti-α6β1 antibody (36Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). GD25 and GD10 cells lacking β1A expressed thevzg-1/edg-2 LPA receptor and also the relatededg-1 receptor. The generality of the findings for better defined cell types remains to be elucidated. Bovine heart or aortic endothelial cells expressing edg-1 respond to LPA with enhanced cell migration. 3T. Panetti, O. Peyruchaud, and D. F. Mosher, manuscript in preparation. In contrast, human MG63 osteosarcoma cells expressingvzg-1/edg-2 respond to LPA with inhibited migration. 2O. Peyruchaud and D. F. Mosher, submitted for publication., 4m. K. Magnusson and D. F. Mosher, submitted for publication. Thus, the germ cell-derived lines should be considered as models of cellular behavior rather than of any one cell type. At least two functions of β1 integrins may account for the need for β1 integrins in migration of the germ cell-derived cells: binding of β1 integrins by insolubilized ligands to allow haptotaxis and synergism between integrin-initiated and LPA-initiated signaling pathways to drive chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Although high concentrations of LPA (10–25 μm) have been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptors in a variety of cell types (41Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 42Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), we could not show such cross-talk for EGF or PDGF receptors of GD25 cells with a concentration of LPA (500 nm) that induced optimal chemotaxis, suggesting that the initial steps in LPA-induced signaling are independent of tyrosine kinase receptors. LPA (19Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and ligated β1 integrins (43Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) both signal by multiple pathways. Our results indicate that the β1A integrin must not only be active but have intact NPXY motifs in the cytoplasmic domain to support LPA-induced migration. The latter requirement differentiates the effect of LPA on migration from the effect of LPA on fibronectin matrix assembly, which is up-regulated by LPA in GD25 cells expressing β1A with conservative Tyr to Phe substitutions (36Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We previously hypothesized that conversion of both tyrosines between nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated states was critical for directed movement, based upon the fact that the Y783F and Y795F mutations caused loss of migration ability to PDGF or EGF (36Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). One scenario is that the conversion between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated states is important for cycling of integrins to facilitate migration in response to a variety of agonist-receptor systems. Phosphorylated integrins may initiate a pathway leading to changes in F-actin containing cytoskeleton and thus to generation of the cellular polarity required for directional movement. In addition, NPXY motifs may regulate cycling of β1integrins. Upon phosphorylation of the NPXY motifs, the integrin may lose its affinity for both extracellular ligand and cytoplasmic components of the focal contacts and exit the focal contact. Dephosphorylation of the motifs would allow the integrin to participate in a new round of ligation and focal contact formation. The phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle may also allow polarization of receptors for chemotactic agents. An alternative scenario is that the enzymatic cascade initiated by ligation of integrins and phosphorylation of β1A is linked with a common pathway initiated by ligated LPA receptor or tyrosine kinase receptors. Expression of a dominant negative Ras inhibits migration in response to both LPA and PDGF but not to soluble fibronectin (35Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Ligated LPA receptors (19Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C.M. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), and ligated EGF or PDGF receptors (41Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) all can work through Ras. Thus, downstream targets of Ras are the most likely common pathway.

Snake venom is one of the most abundant sources of secretory PLA2s. Secretory PLA2s have been classified into three groups, I, II, and III, according to their primary structures (1Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elapidae venom contains group-I PLA2s; and Viperidae venom, group-II ones. These snake venom PLA2s exhibit a wide variety of toxicity, such as neurotoxicity and myotoxicity (2Kini R.M. Evans H.J. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Venomous snakes have PLA2 inhibitory proteins (PLIs) in their blood sera in order to protect them from the leakage of their own venom PLA2s into the circulatory system. We have purified three distinct types of PLA2 inhibitors (PLIα, PLIβ, and PLIγ) from the blood plasma of the Chinese mamushi, Agkistrodon blomhoffii siniticus (3Ohkura N. Okuhara H. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PLIα was found to be a 75-kDa glycoprotein and a trimer of 20-kDa subunits having sequence homology to the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of C-type lectins (4Ohkura N. Inoue S. Ikeda K.

Chem. 1991; 266: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These CRD-like inhibitors inhibited specifically the group II acidic PLA2s, and thus they seemed to recognize a unique aromatic patch structure on the surface of these acidic PLA2molecules (7Inoue S. Shimada A. Ohkura N. Ikeda K. Samejima Y. Omori-Satoh T. Hayashi K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 41: 529-537PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, PLIγ was found to be the same type of inhibitor as those purified from the plasma of Naja kaouthia (8Ohkura N. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Crotalus durissus terrificus (9Fortes-Dias C.L. Lin Y. Ewell J. Diniz C.R. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15646-15651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Perales J. Villela C. Domont G.B. Choumet V. Saliou B. Moussatché H. Bon C. Faure G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is a 100-kDa glycoprotein containing 25- and 20-kDa subunits, and their amino acid sequences were characterized by two tandem patterns of cysteine residues found in Ly-6 related proteins (11Ohkura N. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This type of inhibitor exhibited a broad inhibition spectrum against PLA2s, and it is thought to recognize the Ca2+-binding loop of PLA2s, which is conserved among all the secretory PLA2s. PLIβ was shown to be a 160-kDa glycoprotein having a trimeric structure composed of 50-kDa subunits (3Ohkura N. Okuhara H. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It inhibited only some group II basic PLA2s and did not inhibit other kinds of PLA2s. The N-terminal 30-amino acid sequence of the 50-kDa subunit was determined, but no significant homology was found to the known PLA2inhibitors. In the present study, to elucidate the complete primary structure of PLIβ, we cloned and sequenced the PLIβ cDNA and found that PLIβ is a protein with leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and that its sequence is 33% identical to that of leucine-rich α2-glycoprotein (LRG) from human serum. The blood plasma, venom, and liver of Chinese mamushi (A. blomhoffii siniticus) were obtained from Ueda Trading Co. (Gifu, Japan). A. blomhoffii siniticus basic PLA2 was purified from the venom as described previously (4Ohkura N. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. J. Biochem. 1993; 113: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Chinese mamushi PLIβ was purified to homogeneity from blood plasma as described previously (3Ohkura N. Okuhara H. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PLIβ was deglycosylated with an enzymatic deglycosylation kit (Bio-Rad). O-Linked oligosaccharides were cleaved by the combination ofO-glycanase and N-acetylneuraminidase at 37 °C for 1 h in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. N-Linked oligosaccharides were cleaved by peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) at 37 °C for 3 h in 150 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. PLIβ used for the PNGase F digestion was denatured by treatment with 0.1% SDS and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 5 min prior to the digestion. SDS-PAGE on 11% gels was carried out by the method of Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). After the electrophoresis, protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Blue. For the detection of sugars in glycoproteins, proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gel were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. The glycoproteins on the membrane were detected with a DIG glycan detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). They were oxidized, labeled with digoxigenin, and then detected by an enzyme immunoassay using a digoxigenin-specific antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Mass analysis was performed on a Voyager DE STR (PerSeptive Biosystems) matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer. The instrument was operated in the linear positive ion mode with an accelerating potential in the source of 20 kV. Ionization was accomplished with the 337-nm beam from a nitrogen laser with the laser energy precisely tuned for an optimal signal to noise ratio. Calibration was done externally with a mixture of two standard compounds (bovine serum albumin and horse heart myoglobin). An aliquot (2 μl) of the HPLC-purified, deglycosylated PLIβ in 40% acetonitrile was mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution (10 mg/ml of sinapinic acid in 30% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA). This mixture was deposited on the metal target, allowed to air-dry, and introduced into the MALDI source. Aliquots (5 μl) of the purified PLIβ (140 μg/ml) in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5, ionic strength 0.2) were treated with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)-suberate (Pierce) for 3 h at room temperature. The samples were diluted with the double-strength gel sample buffer containing 0.2 mdithiothreitol, heated to 100 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. A 0.23-nmol amount of PLIβ was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0, 0.7, and 2.1 nmol of basic PLA2 in 100 μl of 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5, ionic strength 0.2) containing 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20. The mixture was then applied to a Superose 12 HR10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. The fractions containing the PLIβ·PLA2 complex were further analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column (The Separations Group). PLIβ was pyridylethylated in the presence of 6m guanidine hydrochloride by the method described previously (13Cavins J.F. Friedman M. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 35: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The pyridylethylated PLIβ was digested with lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Chemicals), and the resultant fragments were separated by HPLC on a Vydac C4 column with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing a linear concentration gradient of acetonitrile from 0 to 48%. The fragments thus obtained were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer equipped with a 120A PTH analyzer. The free thiol group in PLIβ was quantified in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.6 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) in the absence or presence of 6 m guanidine HCl according to Riddles et al. (14Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from fresh liver by use of a total RNA extraction kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+-enriched RNA was obtained using an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA synthesis was carried out by means of a Superscript choice system (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNAs were ligated to the λMOSElox arms (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and packaged via a λ-in vitropackaging module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To obtain the probe for cDNA screening, we performed the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a Chinese mamushi liver total RNA as template. On the basis of the determined N-terminal and internal peptide sequences of PLIβ, two degenerated oligonucleotide primers, ABSPR5 and ABSPR6, were designed for amplification of a cDNA internal fragment by PCR. The primer ABSPR5 (5′-GARAAYGTNACNGARTTYGT-3′, where N, R, and Y denote G/A/T/C, G/A, and T/C, respectively) was oriented in the sense direction and corresponded to the N-terminal residues 11–17 of PLIβ. The primer ABSPR6 (5′-ACDATRCAYTGDATNGGRTT-3′, where D denotes G/A/T), was oriented in the antisense direction and corresponded to residues 186–192. The total RNA was subjected to first-strand cDNA synthesis with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using an oligo(dT) primer. The obtained single-strand cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification with Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) under the following thermal cycling conditions: 5 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 60 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C, followed by 50 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The amplified 550-bp product was cloned into pMOSBlue T-vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), cut out, and labeled with horseradish peroxidase by means of an ECL direct nucleic acid labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plaques were formed using the Chinese mamushi liver cDNA library, then transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and screened with the peroxidase-labeled 550-bp fragment as a probe by hybridizing at 42 °C overnight in an ECL gold hybridization buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing 5% blocking agent. The filters were washed twice for 20 min with 0.5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15m NaCl in 0.015 m sodium citrate) containing 0.4% SDS and 6 m urea at 42 °C, and then twice for 5 min with 2× SSC at room temperature. The positive phages were located with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids were obtained from the isolated phages by in vivo excision. Both strands of DNA were sequenced with a Thermo Sequenase core sequencing kit with 7-deaza-dGTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on an SQ-3000 DNA sequencer (Hitachi) after subcloning into pBluescript (Stratagene). Analysis of DNA sequencing data and alignments of protein sequences were performed by use of DNASIS (Hitachi Software Engineering Co. Ltd.) and BLAST (15Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 215: 403-410Crossref Scopus (68351) Google Scholar) software on EMBL (16Emmert D.B. Stoehr P.J. Stoesser G. Cameron G.N.

A 0.23-μg amount of poly(A)+ RNA prepared from Chinese mamushi liver was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 mformaldehyde and transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The biotinylated probes for RNA blotting analysis were prepared from the amplified 550-bp product with a BioPrime DNA labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). After prehybridization, the membrane was incubated with the probes at 42 °C overnight in SuperSignal NA hybridization buffer (Pierce), washed twice for 5 min with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature, twice for 5 min with 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and then twice for 15 min with 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. After the final wash, the PLIβ transcript was chemiluminescently detected with a SuperSignal NA complete blotting kit for detection of biotinylated probes (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was prepared from Chinese mamushi liver by the standard procedure (18Sambrook K. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For DNA blotting, DNA was completely digested with various restriction endonucleases, electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was hybridized with the peroxidase-labeled 550-bp fragment at 42 °C overnight in an ECL gold hybridization buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing 5% blocking agent, washed twice for 20 min with 0.5× SSC containing 0.4% SDS at 42 °C, and then twice for 5 min with 2× SSC at room temperature. The hybridized fragments were chemiluminescently detected with an ECL direct nucleic acid detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PLIβ was purified from the blood plasma of Chinese mamushi, A. blomhoffii siniticus, by sequential chromatography on Sephadex G-200, Q-Sepharose, Hi-Trap Blue, Hi-Trap Phenyl HP, and Mono-Q HR5/5 columns, as described previously (3Ohkura N. Okuhara H. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of the purified PLIβ showed one protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa (Fig.1). When the PLIβ was treated withN-glycosidase F and a combination ofN-acetylneuraminidase and O-glycanase, the apparent molecular mass was reduced to 39 and 47 kDa, respectively. Since PLIβ treated with N-glycosidase F after the treatment with the combination of N-acetylneuraminidase andO-glycanase gave the same molecular mass of 39 kDa as that treated only with N-glycosidase F, PLIβ was suggested to be a glycoprotein having N-linked, but notO-linked, carbohydrate. Actually, no sugars in PLIβ were detected after the N-glycosidase F treatment (data not shown). Since the molecular mass of 39 kDa, estimated from the migration of the deglycosylated PLIβ on SDS-PAGE gel, seemed to be different from that of 34,594 Da, which was calculated from the sequence determined in the present study, the molecular mass of the deglycosylated PLIβ was confirmed by means of mass spectrometry. The observed molecular mass was 34,674 ± 61.8 Da, which was comparable to the calculated value, indicating that the leucine-rich structure of PLIβ may affect its migration on SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass of 50 kDa obtained from SDS-PAGE of the intact PLIβ subunit was also determined to be 43,857.2 ± 81.9 Da by the mass spectrometry. As described previously (3Ohkura N. Okuhara H. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the molecular mass of PLIβ was determined to be 160 kDa by gel filtration. Thus the native PLIβ was considered to be a trimer of 50-kDa subunits. In order to confirm the trimeric structure of PLIβ, chemical cross-linking experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 2, the subunits of PLIβ could be cross-linked to form dimer and trimer, but no other higher multimer were formed. Therefore, native PLIβ was found to be composed of three homogeneous 50-kDa subunits. Table I shows the quantification of free thiol groups of PLIβ. In the presence of denaturating agents, 1.7 mol of free thiol group was detected in one mol of the PLIβ subunit, while only 0.2 mol was detected in the absence of the denaturating agents. Therefore, two half-cysteine residues of the PLIβ subunit was found to occur as free thiol groups accessible to the modifying reagent only in the denatured conformation.Table ISulfhydryl titration of PLIβ6 mguanidine HClMol of thiol/mol of PLIβ subunitNo. of determination+1.7 ± 0.53−0.21The thiol content was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence or absence of 6 m guanidine HCl. Open table in a new tab The thiol content was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence or absence of 6 m guanidine HCl. As shown in Fig. 3, complex formation of PLIβ with A. blomhoffii siniticus basic PLA2was investigated by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column. When 0.23 nmol of PLIβ and 0.7 nmol of PLA2 were separately applied to the column, they were eluted with a single peak at 28 min and 42 min, corresponding to their respective apparent molecular masses of 160 and 8 kDa. However, when their mixture was applied to the column, the latter peak disappeared, and the height of the former peak increased, suggesting the formation of a stable complex between PLIβ and basic PLA2. The fraction containing the complex of PLIβ and basic PLA2 was obtained by the gel filtration of the mixture containing an excess amount of the PLA2 over PLIβ. Then, PLIβ and basic PLA2 in this fraction were separately quantified by reverse-phase HPLC. The molar ratio of PLA2 to PLIβ was found to be 3.17, suggesting that each subunit of PLIβ may bind one molecule of basic PLA2. Previously, we determined the N-terminal amino acid sequence of PLIβ (3Ohkura N. Okuhara H. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate the internal sequences of PLIβ, we digested reduced andS-pyridylethylated PLIβ with lysyl endopeptidase. Of the resulting peptides, fourteen peptides were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC, and their complete or partial amino acid sequences were determined. On the basis of the determined partial amino acid sequences of PLIβ and its peptides, we synthesized degenerate primers, ABSPR5 and ABSPR6, corresponding to residues 11–17 (ENVTEFV) and 186–192 (NPIQCIV), respectively. Using these degenerate primers for RT-PCR with mamushi liver total RNA as template, we obtained a cDNA fragment of 550 bp. When this fragment was subcloned and sequenced, the deduced amino acid sequence coincided with that of some lysyl endopeptidase peptides, suggesting that the fragment was a part of PLIβ cDNA. Thus this fragment was used as a probe to screen the mamushi liver λMOSElox cDNA library. From the 2 × 106 plaques screened, five positive clones were obtained. Clone pABS205, which contained the largest insert (2.2 kb), was selected and sequenced. The complete nucleotide sequence of PLIβ cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig.4. It contained 2256 bp with a 5′-noncoding region of 12 bp, followed by an open reading frame region of 993 bp, and a 3′-noncoding region of 1241 bp and a poly(A) tail. The open reading frame of this cDNA sequence encoded a protein of 331 amino acids, and its deduced amino acid sequence included the amino acid sequences determined from the lysyl endopeptidase peptides of the purified PLIβ (Fig. 4, underlined). The first 23 amino acids following the initiator methionine have the features of a signal sequence (19Von Heijne G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 307-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Valine at the residue 1 was regarded as the N-terminal residue of the mature protein on the basis of the N-terminal sequence determined from the purified PLIβ. Thus the mature PLIβ was predicted to be composed of 308 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 34,594 Da, which was consistent with the corresponding value of the deglycosylated PLIβ determined by mass spectrometry. There were four potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) in the deduced sequence (Fig. 4, boldface). One of them, asparagine at residue 12, would actually be glycosylated, since no PTH derivatives of asparagine were detected at the corresponding position on the amino acid sequence study of the purified PLIβ (3Ohkura N. Okuhara H. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Two potential polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) occurred at 1503 and 2226 (Fig. 4). Since the latter signal was present 17 bp upstream of the poly(A) tail, it was used as the actual signal by the mRNA from which this cDNA clone was derived. Northern blot analysis revealed that a single hybridizing band of approximately 2.7 kb was observed on the blot of the poly(A)+ RNA isolated from Chinese mamushi liver, indicating that the size of the obtained cDNA is close to that of the full-length copy of mRNA (Fig. 5). Since no other shorter transcripts could be detected, no alternative polyadenylation would occur. Genomic Southern analysis by use of the fragment corresponding to the coding region (nucleotide 112–656) as a probe showed about four bands of different intensity in each lane of genomic DNA digested with different restriction endonucleases (Fig.6 A). A nearly identical pattern of hybridizing bands was observed, when the fragment corresponding to the 3′-noncoding region (nucleotide 1132–2256) was used as a hybridization probe (Fig. 6 B). The restriction digest with EcoRI revealed a major hybridizing band of 2.5 kb on probing with the coding fragment as well as on probing with the noncoding fragment; although the recognition sites of EcoRI were present at positions 1102 and 1132 of PLIβ cDNA, suggesting that the PLIβ gene was not a single copy and that PLIβ-related sequences formed a multigene family in the snake genome. Three distinct types of PLA2 inhibitors (PLIα, PLIβ, and PLIγ) are present in the blood plasma of the Chinese mamushi, A. blomhoffii siniticus (3Ohkura N. Okuhara H. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These inhibitors inhibit three group-II PLA2s (acidic, neutral, and basic PLA2s) from the venom with different specificity. PLIα, specifically inhibits the acidic PLA2 by binding of 1 mol of the PLA2 to 1 mol of the PLIα which is a trimer of 20-kDa subunits (4Ohkura N. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. J. Biochem. 1993; 113: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PLIγ shows a broad inhibition spectrum; i.e. it inhibited all three venom PLA2s almost equally and, furthermore, it inhibited other groups of PLA2s, including Elapidae venom PLA2s (group I) and honeybee PLA2 (group III) (3Ohkura N. Okuhara H. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PLIβ is a specific inhibitor of the venom basic PLA2 of A. blomhoffii siniticus, and it does not inhibit the other two PLA2s (3Ohkura N. Okuhara H. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, 1 mol of the PLIβ, which was composed of three identical subunits of 50-kDa, was found to bind 3 mol of the basic PLA2s, suggesting that each subunit would bind one PLA2 molecule. In the present study, the complete nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding PLIβ was determined. The mature PLIβ was composed of 308 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 34,594. This value is consistent with that obtained by mass spectrometry of the deglycosylated PLIβ. PLIβ was found to be a heavily glycosylated protein having N-linked glycosidic chains. Four potentialN-linked glycosylation sites were identified in the deduced sequence. The amino acid sequence of PLIβ showed no significant structural similarities to those of PLIα and PLIγ. PLIβ contained neither the CRD sequences, which were found in the sequences of PLIα (6Inoue S. Kogaki H. Ikeda K. Samejima Y. Omori-Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PLA2 receptors (20Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ishizaki J. Hanasaki K. Higashino K. Kishino J. Kikuchi N. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5897-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nor the two tandem patterns of cysteine residues found in the sequences of the two homologous subunits of PLIγ (11Ohkura N. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or in Ly-6-related proteins. Searching for homologies by use of the BLAST program revealed that PLIβ shared 33% identity over the whole molecule with human leucine-rich α2-glycoprotein (LRG) (Fig.7). LRG is a human serum protein in which leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) were first discovered (22Takahashi N. Takahashi Y. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1906-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Like LRG, PLIβ contained 9 tandem LRRs of 24 residues each, which encompassed over two-thirds of the molecule (Fig. 8). An alignment of LRRs of PLIβ showed that they contained the consensus sequence ofX-L-X-X-L-D-L-S-X-N-X-L-X-X-L-X-X-X-X-F-X-X-L-X(X denotes any amino acid). Similar LRR consensus sequences have been found in the primary structure of a large number of proteins, including proteins that participate in biologically important processes, such as receptors for hormone, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, proteins for cell adhesion, and ribosome-binding proteins (reviewed in Refs. 23Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar and 24Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Cur. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Although the functions of these proteins are different, all proteins containing LRRs are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. The functions of LRG remain unknown, and its physiological ligand remains unidentified. But, both LRG and PLIβ are serum proteins, and there is 33% identity between their sequences. This may raise the possibility that PLIβ corresponds to the snake LRG and, furthermore, that human LRG functions as a PLA2inhibitor, although evidence on this hypothesis has yet to be demonstrated.Figure 8Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of A. blomhoffii siniticus PLIβ. The sequence ofA. blomhoffii siniticus PLIβ was divided into signal sequence, N-flanking, leucine-rich tandem repeats, and C-flanking regions. Conserved residues in leucine-rich repeats are shown instippled boxes. Secondary structures of the repeating unit predicted on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of ribonuclease inhibitor (23Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) are indicated. Cysteine residues in N-flanking and C-flanking regions are also shown in stippledboxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Many LRR-containing proteins contain homologous regions flanking the LRR domains. These regions are characterized by the patterns of cysteine residues; the consensus sequences can be described as CP(∼2X)CXC(∼6X)C for the amino-flanking and PXXCXC(∼20X)C(∼20X)C for the carboxy-flanking regions (23Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). The carboxy-flanking region of PLIβ was nearly identical to the consensus sequence. The amino-flanking region of PLIβ did not conform to the consensus sequence, but contained a related sequence with two cysteine residues. In addition, there was a proline-rich cluster in the amino-flanking region of PLIβ. This proline-rich cluster is not present in any other LRR-containing proteins, and thus might play an important structural or functional role in PLIβ. Two cysteine residues, Cys-147 and Cys-190, were found in the LRR domain of PLIβ, while no cysteine residues were found in that of LRG. One of the LRR-containing proteins, ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), contained most of cysteine residues in its LRR domain, and all of the cysteine residues occur as free thiol groups (25Lee F.S. Fox E.A. Zhou H.-M. Strydom D.J. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8545-8553Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Of the 10 cysteine residues present in the PLIβ subunit, two were found to occur as free thiols as shown in Table I. Therefore, the 2 cysteine residues with free thiol groups might be assigned to be Cys-147 and Cys-190 found in the LRR domain, because the intrachain disulfide bonding of these cysteine residues could be expected to be unfavorable geometry for the conformation of LRR. The crystal structure of porcine liver RI has been determined (26Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). RI was found to be a nonglobular, horseshoe-shaped molecule with a curved parallel β-sheet lining the inner circumference of the horseshoe and the helices flanking its outer circumference. In this structure, the individual LRR units have essentially the same conformation of β/α structural units, consisting of a short β-strand and an α-helix approximately parallel to each other. The crystal structure of the complex of RI and bovine ribonuclease A (RI-RNase A) has also been determined (27Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). RNase A binds to a concave surface of the inhibitor, mainly comprising its parallel β-sheet and the loops C-terminal to the β-strands. Therefore, the structure of RI-RNase A could serve as a model for the interaction between PLIβ and PLA2. If the LRRs in PLIβ constitute β/α structural units that occur in RI and the whole molecule reveals a horseshoe structure just like the molecule of RI, the PLA2 molecule can be expected to bind to the concave surface of the horseshoe structure of PLIβ. That is, the concave surface would contain a large excess of negatively charged residues, especially aspartate at the sixth residue of the consensus sequence of LRR, and these negative charges could electrostatically interact with the positively charged residues on the basic PLA2 molecule. PLIβ is a selective inhibitor against the group II basic PLA2s from Crotalidae venom, and it does not inhibit other kind of PLA2s. The residues His-1, Arg-6, Glu-17, Trp-70, Lys-111, and Ile-124 are conserved among these group II basic PLA2s, but they are replaced by other residues in all the PLA2s not inhibited by PLIβ. Some of these residues in the PLA2 molecule are therefore thought to be involved in the interaction with the PLIβ molecule. The very extensive binding surface of the RI-RNase A complex was suggested to be in part responsible for the extremely low inhibitory constant (Ki) of 5.9 × 10−14m (28Vicentini A.M. Kieffer B. Matthies R. Meyhack B. Hemmings B.A. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8827-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The inhibitory constant of PLIβ for A. blomhoffii siniticus basic PLA2 was 7.5 × 10−10m (3Ohkura N. Okuhara H. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). That this interaction is much weaker than that of RI and RNase suggests that the number of amino acid residues of PLIβ closely contacting with the PLA2molecule is much smaller than that for the RI-RNase complex and that they were located scatteringly and specifically on the extensive concave surface of the horseshoe. The narrow inhibition spectrum of PLIβ may be accounted for by the local distribution of the contact residues despite the extensive contact area."
https://openalex.org/W2326051492,"Forty early stage malignant and seven borderline ovarian tumours were analysed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 6, 7, 9, 11 and 17. LOH involving at least one locus was observed in 32 (80%) early stage and six (86%) borderline tumours. Frequent LOH in the early stage tumours was detected on chromosome arms 7p (31%), 7q (50%), 9p (42%) and 11q (34%) suggesting that these chromosomes harbour tumour suppressor genes which are inactivated early in tumorigenesis. Borderline tumours exhibited a similar pattern of LOH to that observed in the early stage malignant tumours, indicating that the development of both malignant and borderline forms may involve inactivation of the same set of tumour suppressor genes. Together with our previous investigation of benign ovarian tumours this data supports the theory that malignant ovarian tumours may arise from benign and borderline precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1969591685,"We have recently reported thatl-serine released from astroglial cells supports the survival and neuritogenesis of hippocampal neurons under a serum- and glia-free culture condition (Mitoma, J., Furuya, S., and Hirabayashi, Y. (1998) Neurosci. Res. 30, 195–199). In this study, we show that exogenous l-serine is required for the synthesis of phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS) and sphingolipids in hippocampal neurons. When hippocampal neurons were maintained under an astroglial cell-free condition, the levels of sphingolipids and phosphatidyl-l-serine in the neurons were greatly reduced in the absence of external l-serine or glycine. Instead, a novel phospholipid appeared just ahead of PS on TLC. This novel lipid was determined to be phosphatidyl-l-threonine by TLC blotting/negative secondary ion mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Biochemical studies on rat brain microsomes have indicated that phosphatidyl-l-threonine is synthesized by the base exchange enzyme that is involved in PS synthesis with much lower affinity, that is, approximately 1150 of l-serine. Addition of l-serine or glycine to the culture medium restored the synthesis of PS and sphingolipids in the neurons. These observations show that hippocampal neurons require exogenousl-serine for the synthesis of PS and sphingolipids in the absence of astroglial cells and suggested that astroglial cells contribute to neuronal lipid synthesis through the supply ofl-serine. We have recently reported thatl-serine released from astroglial cells supports the survival and neuritogenesis of hippocampal neurons under a serum- and glia-free culture condition (Mitoma, J., Furuya, S., and Hirabayashi, Y.

These serine-derived lipids play important roles in cellular functions. For example, PS is essential for cell growth (1Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the mutations that reduce sphingolipid synthesis also inhibit the growth of Chinese hamster ovary cells (2Hanada K. Nishijima M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Fujita S. Ogawa T. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23527-23533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and budding yeast (3Pint W.J. Srinivasan B. Shephered S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, these lipids have been shown to be involved in intracellular signal transduction. A certain member of the protein kinase C family interacts with PS (for review see Ref. 4Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4661-4664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent biochemical studies have demonstrated that sphingolipid metabolites such as ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate function as signaling molecules involved in many cellular processes including apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and response to stresses (for reviews see Refs. 5Hannun Y.A. Science. 1997; 274: 1855-1859Crossref Scopus (1500) Google Scholar and 6Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In the case of neurons of the central nervous system, our studies using neuronal cultures have demonstrated that ceramide plays distinct and significant roles in survival and phenotypic growth of cerebellar Purkinje cells (7Furuya S. Ono K. Hirabayashi Y. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1551-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Furuya S. Mitoma J. Makino A Hirabayashi Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 366-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), hippocampal neurons (9Mitoma J. Ito M. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 712-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and spinal motoneurons (10Irie F. Hirabayashi Y. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23 (abstr. 461.6): 1156Google Scholar). Although l-serine is known to be a nonessential amino acid and to be metabolically formed from 3-phosphoglycerate, a metabolite of glycolysis, in cells (for review see Ref. 11Snell K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 241-243Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we have recently demonstrated that hippocampal astroglial cells release a significant amount of l-serine with rapid kinetics and that the amino acid is trophic for hippocampal neurons (12Mitoma J. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 30: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the possibility that l-serine released by astrocytes is taken up by neurons and utilized for the synthesis of various cellular compounds, which might underlie the trophic action ofl-serine on hippocampal neurons. In this study, we investigated whether externally supplied l-serine contributed to the biosynthesis of l-serine-derived membrane lipids in hippocampal neurons. Sphingolipids and PS disappeared rapidly when the neurons were maintained in the absence of exogenous l-serine. In parallel with the disappearance of these serine-derived lipids, a novel aminophospholipid appeared in the neurons. We identified the structure of this lipid as phosphatidyl-l-threonine (PT). Biochemical analysis indicated that PT was synthesized by a base exchange enzyme that catalyzed the synthesis of PS with a different affinity. The biological significance of the glial cell-derived l-serine in the lipid biosynthesis and in the survival of the neurons is discussed. Primary cultures of dissociated hippocampal neurons were prepared from fetal rat (Wistar) of 18 days of gestation as described previously (9Mitoma J. Ito M. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 712-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A total of 2 × 106 cells were plated onto a dish 100 mm in diameter (Falcon 3003, Becton Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ). After 24 h, the medium was changed to a serum-free minimum essential medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 30 nmselenium, 500 μm pyruvate, 3.9 mm glutamine, 16.7 mm glucose, 100 μm putrescine, 10 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml bovine insulin, 0.1 mg/ml human apo-transferrin, and 20 nmprogesterone. To establish glial cell-free cultures, cytosine-β-d-arabinoside (1 μm) was added to the serum-free medium. Neurons cultured for 6 days were harvested from the 100-mm dishes with a cell scraper in Ca2+,Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. Lipids were then extracted using the Bligh-Dyer method (13Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Upper and lower phases were collected and dried under N2 gas and dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). TLC was performed on a Silica Gel 60 HPTLC plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in chloroform/methanol/12 mm MgCl2 (5/4/1, v/v/v) and chloroform/methanol/formic acid/acetic acid/1 mMgCl2 (60/30/6.5/4.5/0.1, v/v/v/v/v) for gangliosides and phospholipids, respectively. The lipids were detected with iodine vapor (14Skipski V.P. Barclay M. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 530-612Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar), ninhydrin (14Skipski V.P. Barclay M. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 530-612Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar), primuline reagent (15Wright R.S. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 220-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and Ryu-MacCoss reagent (16Ryu E.K. MacCoss M. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 561-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For sensitive detection of gangliosides, the HPTLC plate treated with sialidase was stained with horseradish peroxidase-labeled cholera toxin B-subunit as described previously (17Hirabayashi Y. Koketsu K. Higashi H. Suzuki Y. Matsumoto M. Sugimoto M. Ogawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 876: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The lipid was scraped out from the HPTLC plate and extracted with chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v). After washing using the Bligh-Dyer technique, the lower phase was evaporated to dryness. The resultant lipids were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 2 h at 100 °C. The hydrolysate was then applied to a Hitachi l-8500 amino acid analyzer using a packed column for physiological fluid analysis (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Lipids on the HPTLC plate, visualized with primuline reagent, were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Atto Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) as described elsewhere (18Taki T. Kasama T. Handa S. Ishikawa D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The corresponding portion was punched out, and the lipids on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were directly subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Negative secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) spectra were obtained by a TSQ 70 triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finningan MAT, CA) equipped with cesium gun. Triethanolamine was used as SIMS matrix. The lipid on the target was bombarded with a Cs+ beam accelerated at 20 keV. The ion multiplier was 1.5 keV, and the conversion dynode was preset at 20 keV. The microsomal fraction from the adult Wistar rat brain was obtained as follows. Whole brain was homogenized in a homogenization buffer consisting of 0.25m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min, followed by sequential centrifugations of the supernatant at 10,000 ×g for 15 min and 150,000 × g for 15 min. The resultant microsomal pellet was resuspended in the homogenization buffer and used directly for the base exchange analysis. Protein was quantified using the BCA reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Base exchange assay followed the method of Kanfer (19Kanfer J.N. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 15 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm[U-C14]l-serine (37 MBq/mmol, NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) or [U-C14]l-threonine (148 MBq/mmol, NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA), and 200 μg of microsomal protein in a total volume of 200 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of chloroform/methanol (1/2, v/v), followed by partition using the Bligh-Dyer method. The chloroform phase was removed, dried, and dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). After TLC, the radioactivities of PS and PT were quantified using the BAS-2000 imaging analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). To investigate the role of exogenousl-serine in the biosynthesis of lipids in hippocampal neurons, we compared the composition of membrane lipids in neuronal cultures maintained in the presence or absence of externall-serine. Because l-serine and glycine are interconvertible in cells and glycine is also trophic for hippocampal neurons (12Mitoma J. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 30: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of glycine also. Hippocampal neurons were cultured in a serum- and glial cell-free setting for 6 days, and then the total lipids were extracted. We first analyzed the composition of sphingolipids, particularly that of gangliosides, because gangliosides but not sphingomyelin constituted the dominant species of sphingolipids in cultured hippocampal neurons (9Mitoma J. Ito M. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 712-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To visualize complex gangliosides containing the common GM1a structure, gangliosides recovered in the upper phase of the Bligh-Dyer partition were separated by TLC and converted to GM1a by clostridial sialidase treatment, and the resultant GM1a was detected by staining with horseradish peroxidase-labeled cholera toxin B-subunit (17Hirabayashi Y. Koketsu K. Higashi H. Suzuki Y. Matsumoto M. Sugimoto M. Ogawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 876: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, GM1a, GD1a, and GT1b were the major gangliosides observed when hippocampal neurons were maintained in the presence of exogenous l-serine or glycine (lanes 2 and 3). The levels of these neuronal gangliosides were significantly reduced in the absence of externall-serine and glycine (Fig. 1 A, comparelane 1 with lane 2 or 3). A mixture of other nonessential amino acids, l-alanine,l-asparagine, l-aspartic acid, andl-proline, did not restore the amount of gangliosides. We next analyzed the phospholipids in the lower phases of the Bligh-Dyer partition by TLC. Fig. 1 B shows hippocampal neuronal aminophospholipids visualized by ninhydrin staining. When the hippocampal neurons were cultured under l-serine-free conditions, PS was specifically depleted, and a novel band, designated as X1, appeared slightly above the position of PS (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1 and 4). This compound was labeled with Ryu-MacCoss reagent (not shown), indicating that it belongs to the same class of aminophospholipids as PS and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The absence of external l-serine or glycine did not alter the amounts of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol (not shown). Although PE is also an l-serine-derived lipid, only a slight decrease in the level of PE was observed in the absence ofl-serine. Because our culture medium did not contain free ethanolamine, PE cannot be synthesized by the direct coupling of CDP-ethanolamine and diacylglycerol (20Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J. van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, the subtle decrease in the level of PE may be explained by the difference in the turnover rates and/or the size of the metabolic pool between PS and PE. We determined the structure of X1. Hippocampal neuronal lipids were developed on TLC plates, and X1 and two other aminophospholipids, X2 and X3, were purified by scraping out the corresponding bands (Fig.1 B). The amino acid compositions of these lipids were analyzed after acid hydrolysis. Interestingly, X1 possessed onlyl-threonine (Fig.2 A). X2 contained bothl-threonine and l-serine (Fig. 2 B), and l-serine was the dominant amino acid of X3, indicating that X3 corresponds to PS (Fig. 2 C). These analyses revealed that the novel lipid X1 is an l-threonine-containing lipid. To characterize the structure of X1 in detail, we carried out TLC blotting/SIMS analysis. The negative SIMS spectrum of X1 is shown in Fig. 2 D. A pair of major molecule-related ions, [M + Na − 2H]−, was observed atm/z 846 and 870, indicative of the structures of phosphatidyl-l-threonine with C18:0/C20:4 and with C18:0/C22:6, respectively. The ions at the m/z888 and 912 peaks are presumably the adduct of CH2=C=O derived from triethanolamine as reported for the free amino-containing gangliosides GM3 (21Nores G.A. Hanai N. Levery S.B. Eaton H.L. Salyan M.E.K. Hakomori S. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 179: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and GM1 (22Hidari K.I. Irie F. Suzuki M. Kon K. Ando S. Hirabayashi Y. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The characteristic fragment ions generated by sequential elimination of these constituents were atm/z 723 and 747 for phosphatidic acid (C18:0/C20:4 and C18:0/C22:6, respectively), atm/z 560 and 582 for lysophosphatidylthreonine (−H and +Na − 2H, respectively), and atm/z 459 for lysophosphatidic acid (C18:0). We therefore conclude that X1 corresponds to PT. The most abundant unsaturated fatty acid on brain PS was reported to be C18:1 followed by C22:6 (23Sastry P.S. Prog. Lipid Res. 1985; 24: 69-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In fact, the peak corresponding to PT with C18:0/18:1, [M + Na − 2H]−, was detected atm/z 824 in X2 (data not shown). Thus, the fatty acid composition of PT from cultured hippocampal neurons is almost identical to that of PS in mammalian brain. The existence of PT in neurons is being reported for the first time, although this lipid has been shown to exist in tuna muscle (24Igarashi H. Zama K. Katada M. Nature. 1958; 181: 1282-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and polyoma-transformed hamster embryo fibroblasts (25Mark-Malchoff D. Marinetti G.B. Hare G.D. Meisler A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 75: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Mark-Malchoff D. Marinetti G.B. Hare G.D. Meisler A. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2684-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because of the presence of astroglial cells, conditions of l-serine and glycine depletion resulting in PT expression may not occur in hippocampal neuronsin vivo. Therefore, the physiological functions of this unusual lipid remain to be elucidated. The simultaneous reduction in the levels of gangliosides and PS implies that l-serine is not available in sufficient quantities for the synthesis of these lipids in hippocampal neurons cultured in the absence ofl-serine or glycine. The concomitant appearance of PT raises the possibility that neo-synthesis of PT is catalyzed by a base exchange enzyme that is involved in PS biosynthesis. To test this assumption, we examined whether the synthesis of PS is inhibited byl-threonine. We used microsomes from rat whole brain as an enzyme source, because only a small amount of microsomes were obtained from the cultured neurons. As shown in Fig.3 A, l-threonine certainly inhibited PS synthesis in vitro, although the amount of l-threonine required for such inhibition is rather high. The Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated thatl-threonine is a competitive inhibitor with aKi value of 23 mm, whereas theKm value for l-serine was 0.11 mm. We then examined whether PT was synthesized froml-threonine instead of l-serine as a substrate (Fig. 3 B). The formation of PT was dependent onl-threonine concentration, and the Kmvalue for l-threonine was determined to be 16 mm, which is much higher than that forl-serine. The synthesis of PT was greatly inhibited by the addition of lower concentrations of l-serine. The Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated that l-serine competitively inhibited the formation of PT with a Ki value of 0.10 mm. We also observed the synthesis of PT using rat liver microsomes (data not shown). These results indicate that PT is synthesized by the base exchange enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of PS with much lower affinity. Our present study demonstrates that in the absence of exogenousl-serine, hippocampal neurons synthesize PT instead of PS. The generation of PT implies that the intracellular level ofl-serine is insufficient for the synthesis of PS when the neurons are maintained in the absence of exogenousl-serine. This is supported by the observation that exogenous glycine also maintains the level of PS (Fig. 1 B). Glycine is metabolically converted to l-serine by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (27Lehninger A.L. Principles of Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, Inc., New York1982: 620-621Google Scholar). Furthermore, this assumption explains why ganglioside biosynthesis, which requires l-serine, is also inhibited when cultured in the absence of externall-serine or glycine. We have recently reported that significant amounts of l-serine are released from hippocampal astrocytes but not neurons and that this amino acid promotes the survival and morphological development of hippocampal neurons (12Mitoma J. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 30: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, we suggest that hippocampal neurons lose the ability to synthesize sufficient quantities of l-serine and consequently depend on astroglial cells for this amino acid. PT was not detected in lipids extracted from hippocampal regions of normal rat brains (data not shown), suggesting that l-serine was not depleted in normal brain tissues. Indeed, extracellular freel-serine has been reported to be present in the central nervous system (28Shimada N. Graf R. Rosner G. Heiss W.D. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). l-Serine released by astroglial cells probably contributes to the synthesis of l-serine-derived membrane lipids as well as other cellular components in the neurons, which are necessary for the survival of the neurons in vitroand also probably in vivo. At present, the molecular basis of exogenous l-serine requirement in hippocampal neurons is unknown. However, our most recent work demonstrated that the expression of mRNA of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, a rate-limiting enzyme for l-serine synthesis, is significantly reduced in hippocampal neurons. 2J. Mitoma, S. Furuya, and Y. Hirabayashi, manuscript in preparation. This down-regulation might underlie the dependence of hippocampal neurons on astroglial cells for l-serine. Neurons have to take up exogenous l-serine, which is presumably released from astroglial cells, through a specific transporter system. In this context, a cell membrane transporter for l-serine must be regarded as a key factor in terms of the regulation of lipid biosynthesis in neurons and, eventually, neuronal survival.

The translation products of Cf-GSS and Cf-TRS show significant homology to the amidase domain present in E. coliglutathionylspermidine synthetase, which can catalyze both synthesis and degradation of glutathionylspermidine. Glutathionylspermidine synthetase isolated from C. fasciculata was found to possess a similar amidase activity. Several parasitic protozoa belonging to the order Kinetoplastida are human pathogens causing diseases such as sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense); visceral, cutaneous, and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.); and Chagas' disease (Trypanosoma cruzi). Currently, there are no entirely satisfactory drugs for use against these maladies, and no vaccines exist. Many of the currently available drugs suffer from poor efficacy, unacceptable host toxicity, or drug resistance. The mode of action of most trypanocidal drugs is unknown, and currently used compounds were derived empirically, except for the dl-α-difluoromethylornithine, which is a potent inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (1Bey P.

To increase the chances of success, the development of new drugs should be aimed at those steps in a metabolic pathway that are either absent or differ from analogous steps in the host. The polyamines and glutathione (γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine) are found in millimolar concentrations in most biological systems. Polyamines are thought to be essential for cell proliferation and differentiation in most organisms (4Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar, 5Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar, 6Marton L.J. Pegg A.E. Annu. Rev.

Glutathione has a role in several important biochemical processes that include regulation of the intracellular thiol redox balance and defense against oxidant or other chemical-induced damage (8Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (6000) Google Scholar). Unlike most prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, in which the major thiol component is glutathione, members of the order Kinetoplastida rely on a glutathione-spermidine conjugate called trypanothione (N 1,N 8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine) (9Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 14: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Fairlamb A.H. Blackburn P. Ulrich P. Chait B.T. Cerami A. Science. 1985; 227: 1485-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Trypanothione seems to be an essential redox intermediate in the regulation of the intracellular thiol redox, analogous to glutathione in other organisms, and also to play a role in defense against oxidative stress. In fact, these parasites lack typical catalase, glutathione peroxidase (11Boveris A. Stoppani A.M. Experientia. 1977; 33: 1306-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Boveris A. Sies H.

FEBS Lett. 1987; 221: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and glutathione reductase (9Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 14: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which function in oxidant defense in other organisms. The parasites utilize an analogous system involving trypanothione reductase, an enzyme similar to glutathione reductase, which uses trypanothione as a cofactor (14Shames S.L. Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3519-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, trypanothione metabolism represents an attractive candidate for rational drug design, since it is uniquely found in the Kinetoplastida (15Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of trypanothione involves ATP-dependent conjugation of intact glutathione to the two terminal amino functions of spermidine (16Fairlamb A.H. Henderson G.B. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The original report (17Henderson G.B Yamaguchi M. Novoa L. Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3924-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) of a single enzyme fromCrithidia fasciculata converting glutathione and spermidine into trypanothione, called trypanothione synthetase, has been superseded by the identification of two distinct ATP-dependent enzymes involved in the synthesis of trypanothione (18Smith K.

GSS and TRS co-purify as a functional complex but can be separated by hydrophobic chromatography (18Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or by extraction in aqueous two-phase systems (19Koenig K. Menge U. Kiess M. Wray V. Flohé L. J. Biol.

Glutathionylspermidine (N 1-(γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycyl)spermidine) has also been identified in Escherichia coli (20Dubin D.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1959; 1: 262-265Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Tabor H. Tabor C.W. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 312: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The function of this compound in E. coli is not known, although it has been suggested that it is involved in regulating the levels of the precursors (spermidine and glutathione). More recently, Bollingeret al. (23Bollinger J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Kwon D.S. Lin C-H. Chen S. Coward J.K. Walsh C.T. Bollinger J.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14930-14938Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported the cloning and characterization of a bifunctional E. coli glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase enzyme responsible for both the biosynthesis and degradation of glutathionylspermidine in E. coli. We report here the cloning and characterization of the glutathionylspermidine (Cf-GSS) and trypanothione (Cf-TRS) synthetase genes from C. fasciculata and their overexpression in E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. C. fasciculata clone HS6 (26Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar) was used as source for DNA, RNA, and protein. Routine DNA manipulations were performed in E. coli strain JM109 and XL1-Blue. Overexpression in E. coli was performed in strain BL21(DE3), and overexpression in yeast was performed in S. cerevisiae ABYS106 strain. All chemicals were of the highest grade available and from Sigma or BDH. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Promega. C. fasciculata GSS and TRS were purified as described (18Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and separated by SDS-PAGE. The bands were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC essentially as described by Stone and Williams (27Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., London1993: 45-69Google Scholar). The automated Edman degradation was performed using an ABI 477A protein sequencer with a 120A online PTH-AA analyzer by Dr. W. S. Lane (Harvard Microchemistry Facility). Two degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on the sequence of two trypsin peptides from the 90-kDa band (GSS activity) (18Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (FDFGYDG (named GSS1), 5′-TTY GAY TTY GGN TAY GAY GG-3′; and EPLWK (named DTC2), 5′-YTT CCA NAD NGG YTC-3′). PCR was performed in a 50-μl volume containing 0.2 mm each dNTP, 500 ng of each primer, 100 ng of C. fasciculata total genomic DNA, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase with buffer (Bioline). Before adding the enzyme, the PCR mixture was heated for 10 min at 95 °C and then cooled rapidly to 30 °C. Following centrifugation, the enzyme was added, and the reaction mixture was covered with oil and subjected to the following for 30 cycles: denaturation for 10 s at 95 °C, ramping at 2 °C s−1 to 40 °C, annealing for 1 s at 40 °C, and elongation for 30 s at 72 °C. A final 10-min extension at 72 °C was included. A 561-bp DNA fragment was identified following agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products. The DNA fragment was cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18 (SureClone kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), giving the plasmid pGSS, and sequenced with a T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on the sequence of two trypsin peptides from the 82-kDa band (TRS activity) (18Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (DLNDPAEK (named TRS2), 5′-GAY YTN AAY GAY CCN GCN GAR AA-3′; and DGYYAIIG (named TRS4), 5′-CC DAT DAT NGC RTA NCC RTC-3′). PCR was performed as described above for the GSS gene. A 1089-bp DNA fragment was identified following agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products. The DNA fragment was cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18, giving the plasmid pTRS, and sequenced as above. Genomic DNA was isolated from C. fasciculata as described (28Bernards A. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Frasch C.A. Borst P. Boothroyd J.C. Coleman S. Cross G.A.M. Cell. 1981; 27: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), digested with PstI or SalI, and subsequently separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA in the size range 3–4 kb (PstI) and 1–1.5 and 3–3.5 kb (SalI) were isolated (QIAEX Extraction Kit, QIAGEN), ligated to pUC18 vector (digested with PstI or SalI and dephosphorylated, Appligen), and transformed in E. coli XL1-Blue. ThePstI and SalI sublibraries each contained about 20,000 recombinant plasmids. The cloned GSS1/DTC2 PCR fragment was isolated following digestion of pGSS with EcoRI–PstI and separation by agarose gel electrophoresis, labeled with [32P]dCTP by the random primer method (Ready Prime, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and used to screen approximately 10,000 clones from the C. fasciculata PstI sublibrary. Colonies were transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized to the labeled probe at high stringency (60 °C in 6× SSPE (1× SSPE: 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mg ml−1 salmon sperm DNA). Washing was carried out three times at room temperature in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS and two times at 60 °C in 0.2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS. Positive clones were isolated, and plasmids were subsequently amplified. The cloned TRS2/TRS4 PCR fragment was isolated following digestion of pTRS with EcoRI–HindIII and separation by agarose gel electrophoresis, labeled with [32P]dCTP by the random primer method, and used to screen approximately 10,000 clones from the C. fasciculata SalI sublibraries. Colonies were transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized to the labeled probe at high stringency as described for the PstI sublibrary. Positive clones were isolated and subsequently amplified. C. fasciculata genomic DNA (5 μg) and total RNA (10 μg) were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were hybridized with DNA corresponding to theCf-GSS or Cf-TRS coding sequence labeled with [32P]dCTP and washed as described above for the screening of sublibraries. Sequencing of double-stranded DNA was accomplished by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) as described in the T7 sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and confirmed by automated cycle sequencing using the dye terminator method (ABI PRISM dye terminator kit, Perkin-Elmer). DNA and amino acid sequences were analyzed with the Lasergene system (DNASTAR Inc.) program and the Pileup program from the Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Software Package. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) expressing the Cf-GSS gene was obtained by transformation with the gene cloned in the expression vector pET-3a (Novagen). The gene was obtained by PCR amplification of the C. fasciculataopen reading frame in plasmid pTCf-GSS using oligonucleotide ExpGSS5′ (5′-CCA CAT ATG TCG TCG CTG-3′) for the sense strand containing an NdeI cloning site (underlined) incorporating an initiation codon (ATG). For the antisense strand, oligonucleotide ExpGSS3′ (5′-CCG GGA TCC TTA TGT TTC-3′) was designed, which includes a stop codon with a BamHI restriction site (underlined) just downstream. The PCR product was blunt end-ligated into the SmaI site of pUC18 (SureClone kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), giving the plasmid pUC18-Cf-GSS. The insert was removed from this subclone by digestion with NdeI–BamHI and ligated with the pET-3a vector, creating plasmid pET-Cf-GSS. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) expressing the Cf-TRS gene was obtained by transformation with the gene cloned in the expression vector pET-3a. The gene was obtained in a similar fashion toCf-GSS with the following primers: ExpTRS5′ (5′-AAA GAA TTCCAT ATG GCG TCC GCT GAG-3′) for the sense strand and ExpTRS3′ (5′-CCC GGA TCC CTA CTC ATC CTC GGC-3′) for the antisense strand. The PCR product was blunt end-ligated into theSmaI site of pUC18 (SureClone kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), giving the plasmid pUC18-Cf-TRS. The insert was removed from this subclone by digestion withNdeI–BamHI and ligated with the pET-3a vector, creating plasmid pET-Cf-TRS. BL21(DE3)/pET-Cf-GSSor BL21(DE3)/pET-Cf-TRS were grown at 37 °C with vigorous aeration in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin. When cultures reached anA600 of ∼0.6, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 0.4 mm to induce expression of the recombinant Cf-GSS or Cf-TRS protein. Cultures were grown an additional 3–4 h and then harvested by centrifugation. Cells were lysed in 50 mm bis-Tris propane buffer (pH 6.8) by flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen, followed by rapid thawing and then sonication (six 45-s pulses interrupted with cooling on ice). Cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g. A S. cerevisiae strain (ABYS106) expressing the Cf-GSS gene was obtained by transformation with the gene cloned in the expression vector pRB1438 under the control of the GAL1 promoter (kindly provided by Dr. P. Andrews, Department of Biochemistry, University of Dundee). The coding sequence was removed from the plasmid pUC18-Cf-GSS by digestion with BamHI and ligated with the pRB1438 vector, creating plasmid pRB1438-Cf-GSS (Fig.2). The orientation of the gene was determined using the SacI restriction site. A S. cerevisiae strain (ABYS106) expressing theCf-TRS gene and one co-expressing both the Cf-GSSand Cf-TRS genes were obtained by transformation with the gene cloned in the expression vector pRB1438 under the control of the GAL1 and/or GAL10 promoters. The coding sequence was removed from the plasmid pUC18-Cf-TRS by digestion with BamHI orEcoRI and ligated into both the pRB1438 and pRB1438-Cf-GSS vectors, creating the plasmids pRB1438-Cf-TRS and pRB1438-Cf-GSS/Cf-TRS, respectively (Fig. 2). The orientation of the gene was determined using the KpnI and XhoI restriction sites. ABYS106/pRB1438-Cf-GSS cells, ABYS106/pRB1438-Cf-TRS cells, and ABYS106/pRB1438-Cf-GSS/Cf-TRS cells were grown at 26 °C with vigorous aeration in synthetic complete medium with 2% raffinose supplemented with auxotrophic nutrients except uracil (30Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1982Google Scholar). When cultures reached 5 × 106 cells ml−1, galactose was added to a concentration of 2–4% to induce expression of the recombinant Cf-GSS and/orCf-TRS protein. Cultures were grown an additional 8 h and then harvested by centrifugation. Cells were lysed in 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8215), and glass beads by vortexing. Cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. S. cerevisiae ABYS106, ABYS106/pRB1438-Cf-GSS, ABYS106/pRB1438-Cf-TRS, and ABYS106/pRB1438-Cf-GSS/Cf-TRS were grown as described previously under aerobic conditions. When cultures reached a growth of 5 × 106 cells ml−1, galactose was added to a concentration of 2–4% and grown for an additional 8 h. Thiols were determined by HPLC after derivatization of 2 × 107 cells with monobromobimane as described previously (26Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the GSS and TRS enzymes was performed according Smith et al. (18Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The amidase activity was assayed in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 6.5 or 7.5) in a final volume of 100 μl in the presence of 2 mm glutathionylspermidine (stock solution reduced with a 5-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol). After incubation with 0.5–2 μg of either a mixture of GSS/TRS or purified GSS for 30 min, 10 μl of the reaction mixture was analyzed for thiols as above. After desalting the sample on a Sephadex G-50 column, the purified protein was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionizaton time-of-flight biospectrometry using a Perseptive Biosystems mass spectrometer in linear mode with an acceleration voltage of 25 kV. Two degenerate oligonucleotides were designed from two of the above peptide sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”). A 561-bp fragment was amplified from the primers GSS1/DTC2 using C. fasciculata genomic DNA and subsequently cloned into pUC18, giving the plasmid pGSS. Sequence analysis verified that this DNA fragment encoded an open reading frame (ORF) with sequence similarity toE. coli glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase (23Bollinger J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). C. fasciculata genomic DNA was digested by several restriction enzymes and probed with the labeled GSS1/DTC2 PCR fragment (see below). The probe hybridized to only a single ∼4-kbPstI fragment. The GSS1/DTC2 PCR fragment was labeled with [32P]dCTP and used to screen a C. fasciculatagenomic PstI sublibrary (see “Experimental Procedures”). Three identical clones were isolated, which contained a DNA fragment of ∼4 kb. Clone pTCf-GSS (insert size 3925 bp) contained a 2157-bp ORF, which was sequenced on both strands. This ORF encodes a 719-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 80,336 Da (Fig. 3), significantly smaller than the expected molecular mass (90 kDa) reported for GSS (18Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Each of the six peptide sequences determined from the 90-kDa protein (underlined in Fig. 3) was found in the predicted protein product. A 1089-bp fragment was amplified from C. fasciculata genomic DNA using the primers TRS2/TRS4 (designed from two of the above peptide sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”)) and subsequently cloned into pUC18, giving the plasmid pTRS. Sequence analysis verified that this DNA fragment encoded an open reading frame with sequence similarity to E. coli glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase (23Bollinger J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and pTCf-GSS. C. fasciculata genomic DNA was digested with several restriction enzymes and probed with the labeled TRS2/TRS4 PCR fragment (see below). The probe hybridized to fragments of ∼1.3 and ∼3.5 kb when DNA was digested with SalI, suggesting that these fragments contained all of the coding sequence. The TRS2/TRS4 PCR fragment was labeled with [32P]dCTP and used to screen the C. fasciculata genomic SalI sublibraries (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two different clones corresponding to the ∼1.3- and ∼3.5-kb fragments were isolated. Reconstruction of these two clones gave the plasmid pTCf-TRS, which contains an ORF encoding a protein of 652 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 74,516 Da (Fig. 3), again smaller than the apparent molecular mass (82 kDa) previously described (18Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A PCR product overlapping theSalI restriction site was cloned to confirm the sequence at this site. Seven of the nine peptide sequences determined from the 82-kDa band (underlined in Fig. 3) were found in the predicted protein product. The predicted translation products of Cf-GSS andCf-TRS from C. fasciculata show significant homology to each other (47% similarity and 27% identity) and to the glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase from E. coli (50% similarity and 29% identity) (23Bollinger J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences ofCf-GSS and Cf-TRS also show significant similarity (∼25%) in their C-terminal 500 amino acids with three hypothetical 45-kDa proteins, two from E. coli (YgiC (31Yang T-P. Depew R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and YjfC (32Burland V.D. Plunkett G. Sofia H.J. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R.

Another interesting feature arising from the alignment of these different proteins is that the Cf-GSS amino acid sequence has five significant insertions (Cf-GSS amino acids 54–71, 241–269, 325–328, 466–479, and 590–629) (Fig. 3) when compared with the E. coli GSS and Cf-TRS, while theCf-TRS protein has a size more similar to E. coliGSS. The significance of a large insertion in the C-terminal domain of the Cf-GSS protein, where the potential synthetase activity of the E. coli GSS is predicted to reside (23Bollinger J.M. Kwon D.S.

Indeed, amidase activity was present in GSS purified from C. fasciculata using glutathionylspermidine as a substrate (Fig.4). As for the E. coli GSS (23Bollinger J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R.

Under identical conditions, no formation of glutathionylspermidine from trypanothione was detected (not shown). C. fasciculata genomic DNA was digested with several restriction enzymes and probed with the labeled Cf-GSS andCf-TRS coding sequences. The Cf-GSS probe hybridized to only a single band when DNA was cut with enzymes that do not cut within the coding sequence (BamHI, HindIII, KpnI,XbaI, and PstI), whereas the probe hybridized to two fragments when the DNA was cut with enzymes that cut at a single site within the coding sequence (SacI, NotI, andEcoRV) and five fragments (of which two are the same size) when the DNA was cut with SalI, which cut four times in the coding sequence (Fig. 5, A1and B1).

https://openalex.org/W2055826155,"Oxidation of the biologically important polyamines spermine and spermidine by plasma amine oxidase (PAO) was specified many years ago to occur at the terminal primary rather than internal secondary amine positions. However, the finding of sequential enzymatic conversion of spermine to spermidine and then to putrescine (1,4-butanediamine) is superficially suggestive of metabolism at the secondary amine positions, and a recent publication (Houen, G., Bock, K., and Jensen, A. L. (1994) Acta Chem. Scand. 48, 52–60) claimed that the original interpretation of preferential “terminal” deamination does not stand up to scrutiny with modern methods of analysis. We herein demonstrate that the findings cited in support of secondary amine deamination can arise artifactually from spontaneous elimination/addition reactions following initial metabolism at the terminal positions of 3-(aminopropyl)amines. We further find no evidence for the ability of PAO to metabolize the secondary amine position in homospermidine, which is devoid of such complicating side reactions. Our results support the original claimed specificity of PAO for the primary amino termini of polyamines, all of which are consistent with the general finding that the quinone-dependent copper amine oxidases specifically metabolize primary amines. Oxidation of the biologically important polyamines spermine and spermidine by plasma amine oxidase (PAO) was specified many years ago to occur at the terminal primary rather than internal secondary amine positions.

In the early days of clarification of the substrate specificity of the soluble amine oxidase present in mammalian plasma (PAO), 1The abbreviations used are: PAO, plasma amine oxidase; BPAO, bovine plasma amine oxidase; HRMS, high resolution mass spectrometry. the Tabor group (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Bachrach U. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2194-2203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the naturally occurring polyamines spermine and spermidine are metabolized at the primary amino termini, in contrast to several bacterial amine oxidases that metabolize polyamines at the secondary nitrogen atoms (2Tabor C.W. Kellogg P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5424-5433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Adachi O. Yamada H. Ogata K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1966; 30: 1202-1210Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The soluble plasma enzyme (EC1.4.3.6), now known as one class of a family of copper-containing amine enzymes, is thereby distinguished from the flavin-dependent amine oxidases present in mammalian mitochondria, which although primarily involved in metabolism of primary amines, can also dehydrogenate certain secondary and tertiary amines (4Ding C.Z. Lu X. Nishimura K. Silverman R.B. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). With the recognition that the copper-containing amine oxidases metabolize amines through a transamination process mediated by an active site 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone cofactor derived post-translationally from a conserved tyrosine (5Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27189-27192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the restriction to primary amine substrates might be viewed as a simple consequence of the need to form a neutral Schiff base with the quinone cofactor in the first step of the enzymatic mechanism. However, secondary amines could theoretically also fulfill a transamination mechanism via initial formation of an iminium quinone-derived intermediate. In fact, there have been isolated claims of the ability of certain secondary amines to be processed by the copper-containing plasma amine oxidases (6Anthony D.C. Amarnath V. Graham D.G. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1989; 48: 348Crossref Google Scholar, 7Wilmarth K.R. Froines J.R. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1991; 32: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, in these cases (N-methyl-β-aminopropionitrile and β,β'-iminodipropionitrile), we suspected that the commercial materials contained traces of the corresponding primary amine β-aminopropionitrile, a known substrate/inactivator of PAO (8Raimondi L. Banchelli G. Bertocci B. Lodovici M. Ignesti G. Pirisino R. Buffoni F. Bertini V. De Mundo A. Agents Actions. 1985; 16: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and inactivator of lysyl oxidase (9Tang S.-S. Trackman P.C. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4331-4338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we showed that successive purification cycles of the secondary amines eliminated the production of H2O2 during their incubation with PAO. 2F. Wang and L. M. Sayre, unpublished studies. It was thus very surprising to us to see the provocative claim by Houenet al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that the metabolism of polyamines (spermine and spermidine) by plasma amine oxidases occurs principally at the secondary rather than primary amine centers. These workers provided data on the sequential conversion of spermine to spermidine and then to putrescine, which they claimed resulted from regiospecific oxidation at the two internal secondary amine positions of spermine, releasing 1 and then 2 eq of 3-aminopropanal (Scheme FS1). Upon attempted isolation, the latter is unstable with respect to elimination to acrolein and ammonia and could only be identifiedqualitatively by ion-exchange chromatography (before and after borohydride reduction) and by 1H NMR spectroscopy. A review of the literature published since the initial studies by the Tabor group reveals that the formation of spermidine and then putrescine had been consistently observed (11Tabor C.W. Rosenthal S.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1956; 116: 139-155PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bachrach U. Bar-Or R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 40: 545Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 13Tabor C.W. Tabor H. McEwen Jr., C.M. Kellogg P.D. Fed. Proc. 1964; 23: 385Google Scholar), although Bachrach and co-workers (14Bachrach U. Plesser Y.M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) interpreted this to be a consequence notof secondary amine oxidation but of spontaneous elimination of acrolein by the labile aminopropionaldehyde products of terminal deamination (Scheme FS2). One piece of evidence obtained by the Tabor group in support of metabolism of polyamines at the terminal rather than internal amino groups was their quantitation of the released ammonia (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Bachrach U. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2194-2203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In retrospect, this alone would be insufficient distinguishing evidence since the same amount of ammonia would be generated according to the Scheme FS1 proposal of Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the Tabor group also endeavored to identify the nature of the released aldehyde product(s) and finding these to be thermally labile, ultimately achieved a consistent result by using short treatments with relatively high amounts of enzyme, in which case the metastabledialdehyde product of double terminal amine oxidation could be trapped by a prompt NaBH4 post-treatment (Scheme FS3) (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Bachrach U. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2194-2203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A good yield of the stableN,N′-bis(3-hydroxypropyl)-1,4-butanediamine, identified by comparison to an authentic standard, required a short incubation time (15 min) with a relatively high concentration of enzyme prior to NaBH4 quenching. In retrospect, these results are understandable in terms of the spontaneous acrolein elimination competing kinetically with enzymatic deamination (Scheme FS2) when lower enzyme concentrations are used. In their work, Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) also considered the terminal deamination pathway claimed by Tabor et al. (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Bachrach U. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2194-2203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but ruled it out on the basis of their failure to detect the requisiteN,N′-bis(3-hydroxypropyl)-1,4-butanediamine and their identification of 3-aminopropanal instead. Moreover, in their hands, the spermine → spermidine → putrescine conversion pattern was unaffected by a NaBH4 post-treatment. Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) stated that the early conclusion of terminal deamination relied on what would be considered today as inadequate methods of product characterization, whereas they now had access to more modern methods (NMR, HPLC). However, it seems clear to us that despite citing the seminal Tabor group paper (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Bachrach U. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2194-2203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) did not recognize how rapidly the borohydride quench had to be carried out to avert elimination of acrolein by the initial aminoaldehyde products. In fact, they seemed unaware that their own experimental conditions (low enzyme concentration and longer reaction times) had been described by Tabor et al. (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Bachrach U. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2194-2203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be inadequate to achieve deamination at the second amino terminus during the time that the aminoaldehyde generated at the first amino terminus still survived. Thus, Houenet al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) had no chance to observe the borohydride-trapped product of double terminal deamination. Independent of the above controversy, additional evidence for PAO metabolism of secondary amines presented by Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was their observed time-dependent production of benzaldehyde from N-ethylbenzylamine, using the bovine plasma enzyme (BPAO). However, their graph showed that there was no oxidation at all for the first 6 h. The low level of benzaldehyde formed at later times could thus reflect autoxidation of this benzylic secondary amine (15Lee Y. Sayre L.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3096-3105Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), possibly aided by copper released upon deterioration of the enzyme after long term incubation. A key complication surrounding the mechanistic controversy is that if oxidation by PAO occurs exclusively at the primary amino termini as originally claimed (Scheme FS2), then it is not immediately obvious why Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were able to trap 3-aminopropanal, predicted according to their secondary amine oxidation route (SchemeFS1). Although Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) thereby concluded that spermidine was undergoing internal deamination, we suspected that 3-aminopropanal might be arising instead from combination of the ammonia and acrolein formed in the terminal deamination pathway (SchemeFS2). In the present investigation, we first confirm the formation of 3-aminopropanal from the reaction of ammonia and acrolein employing concentrations that would be present according to the conditions used by Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) for oxidation of spermidine. Second, we used homospermidine, also a naturally occurring polyamine (16Kuttan R. Radhakrishnan A.N. Spande T. Witkop B. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), as an alternative tool to study the site of metabolism by BPAO, since extension of one methylene group would abrogate the acrolein elimination side reaction that results in the above-described mechanistic conundrum. Our results reaffirm the initial conclusions of the Tabors and Bachrach that PAO metabolism of polyamines occurs strictly at the primary amino termini. NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Gemini 300 instrument (1H NMR at 300 MHz; 13C NMR at 75 MHz), with chemical shifts being referenced to the solvent peak. High resolution mass spectra (HRMS, electron impact) were obtained at 20–40 eV on a Kratos MS-25A instrument. All solvents, reagents, and organic fine chemicals were the most pure available from commercial sources. Acrolein and 1-pyrrolidinebutyronitrile were freshly distilled before use. Doubly distilled water was used for all experiments. BPAO (100 units/g of protein) and catalase were purchased from Sigma). All evaporations were conducted at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. Deuterated buffers were prepared by first pH-adjusting aqueous phosphate solution, evaporating, and redissolving the salts in D2O. An NMR experiment was carried out by mixing acrolein (0.28 μl, 2 mm) and NH4OH (2.6 μl of 30% aqueous solution, 20 mm) in 2 ml of 100 mmphosphate buffer (D2O, pH 7.2). The 1H NMR spectrum was recorded periodically over a 3-day period. Signals corresponding to 3-aminopropanal hydrate at δ 3.10 and 5.21 (first apparent after 3 h) grew as the signals corresponding to starting acrolein decreased. After 24 h, little change in the spectrum occurred, except for the new appearance of an unknown singlet at δ 3.68. When the [NH4+] was reduced to become stoichiometric with acrolein (2 mm), as would be predicted by Scheme FS2, unknown 1H NMR signals at δ 3.69 and 5.16 were observed. In their experiments, Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) started with 0.2 mm spermidine (in 100 mm pH 7.2 phosphate buffer), which would ultimately give 0.2 mmacrolein. Our experiments used a 10-fold higher concentration to permit1H NMR monitoring. The [NH4+] present in the Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) experiment would also be only 0.2 mm if the only source of ammonia were its generation stoichiometric with acrolein, in which case our model1H NMR experiment failed to detect aminopropanal. However, Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) used partially purified BPAO, which we suspect contained some (NH4)2SO4. Indeed, in the experiment where Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) detected aminopropanal by ion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 5 of Ref. 10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the NH3 peak present at time = 0 was nearly as large as it was at time = 20 h. Although we can thus only guess at the [NH4+] in their experiment, we presume that it was in excess of [acrolein], as in our experiment. A mixture of acrolein (140 μl, 2 mm) and NH4OH (1.3 ml of 30% aqueous solution, 20 mm) in 1 liter of phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.2) was stirred at room temperature for 3.5 h. Then NaBH4 (3.7 g, 100 mmol) was added with stirring, and after 20 min, acetic anhydride (20 ml, 200 mmol) was added dropwise while maintaining the reaction mixture at pH 10.5 by addition of 1 m NaOH solution. After stirring an additional 30 min, the reaction mixture was concentrated until the first signs of a precipitate appeared. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 ml × 3). The combined organic extract was dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated, and the resulting residue was placed under high vacuum. After most of the CH3CONH2 by-product was sublimed under vacuum, the remaining residue was dissolved in CDCl3 for1H NMR analysis. The chemical shifts of the major (60%) compound present (δ 1.67 (p, J = 5.7 Hz, 2H), 1.99 (s, 3H), 3.38 (q, J = 5.6 Hz, 2H), 3.63 (t,J = 5.8 Hz, 2H)) match the 1H NMR spectrum of 3-(N-acetyl)aminopropanol previously reported (17Fernandez S. Menendez E. Gotor V. Synthesis. 1991; : 713-716Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The minor (30%) compound present, displaying 1H NMR signals at δ 1.82 (p, 2H), 1.98 (s, 6H), 3.27 (q, 2H), and 4.11 (t, 2H), is assigned as the N,O-diacetyl derivative of 3-aminopropanol. The remaining 1H NMR peaks (corresponding to 10% of the total integral) were not identified. To a solution of homospermidine·3HCl (25 mg, 93 mmol), prepared as described (18Bergeron R.J. Burton P.S. McGovern K.A. Kline S.J. Synthesis. 1981; : 732-733Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), in 25 ml of phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.2), were added 250 μl of catalase (4000 unit/ml in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) and 500 μl of BPAO (dialyzed for 3 h against phosphate buffer to remove (NH4)2SO4), and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The incubation solution was placed in an ice bath, and 3 ml of freshly prepared NaBH4 (200 μm in 1 maqueous NaOH) was added. After stirring the mixture for 20 min at room temperature, acetic anhydride (1 ml) was added slowly while maintaining the solution at pH 10.5 by dropwise addition of 0.5 m NaOH. Upon completion of the addition, the pH was raised to 12.5 for 20 min and then lowered to 10.5 by dropwise addition of dilute HCl. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure until most of the water was removed. The remaining residue was extracted with EtOAc (50 ml × 2), and the organic layer was dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated to afford a viscous oil. 1H NMR analysis showed a clean mixture of triacetylated homospermidine 5 and 1-(4-acetamidobutyl)pyrrolidine (6) in a 5:1 ratio (NMR signals of the independently synthesized samples are given below). A duplicate reaction incubated for 20 h before NaBH4reduction and treated as described above afforded the same mixture of5 and 6 in a 1.3:1 ratio. A mixture of homospermidine·3HCl (54 mg, 0.2 mmol), Ac2O (190 μl, 2 mmol), and triethylamine (279 μl, 2 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (10 ml) was stirred overnight at room temperature. The volatile material was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was treated with concentrated Na2CO3 (1 ml). Extraction with EtOAc (20 ml × 2) and concentration of the organic layer gave a crude mixture that was purified by flash column chromatography using EtOAc:MeOH (1:1) as eluant to afford the triacetyl derivative5 of homospermidine: 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 1.24–1.50 (8H), 1.80 (s, 6H), 1.90 (s, 3H), 3.00–3.17 (8H), 7.24 (bt, NH, 2H); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 21.5, 23.0(2C), 24.9, 26.0, 26.4, 26.8, 38.6, 38.8, 45.0, 48.3, 170.3, 170.7 (2C); HRMS calculated for C14H27N3O3 m/z 285.2054, found 285.2048. The asymmetry seen in the NMR spectrum most likely reflects intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl of the tertiary amide group and one of the two terminal secondary amide groups. A solution of AlCl3 (5 g, 38 mmol) in anhydrous ether (100 ml) was added to LiAlH4 (1.45 g, 38 mmol) in anhydrous ether (100 ml). The mixture was stirred under argon for 10 min followed by addition of 1-pyrrolidinebutyronitrile (4.6 g, 33 mmol) in anhydrous ether (50 ml). After heating at reflux for 3 h, the mixture was cooled to O °C and quenched with aqueous 30% KOH (50 ml). Ether (200 ml) was added, and the reaction mixture was heated at reflux for an additional 30 min. The organic layer was decanted, dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated to give a crude oil that was distilled under reduced pressure to yield 3.7 g (79%) of 1-(4-aminobutyl)pyrrolidine: 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 1.45 (m, 4H), 1.72 (m, 4H), 1.88 (bs, NH2, 2H), 2.39 (t, J = 6.71 Hz, 2H), 2.44 (m, 4H), 2.65 (t,J = 6.71 Hz, 2H); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 23.4(2C), 26.4, 31.9, 42.1, 54.2(2C), 56.4; HRMS calculated for C8H18N2 m/z 142.1471, found 142.1469. A mixture of the latter amine (142 mg, 1 mmol), Ac2O (0.94 ml, 10 mmol), and triethylamine (1.39 ml, 10 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (30 ml) was stirred overnight at room temperature. The volatile material was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was treated with concentrated Na2CO3 (1 ml). Extraction of the aqueous solution with EtOAc (30 ml × 2) and concentration of the organic layer gave pure 6 (152 mg, 83%): 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 1.59 (4H), 1.81 (m, 4H), 2.50 (t,J = 6.90 Hz, 2H), 2.56 (m, 4H), 3.23 (dt,J = 6.90 and 5.67 Hz, 2H), 6.83 (bs, NH, 1H); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 23.3, 23.4(2C), 26.4, 27.7, 39.4, 54.0(2C), 55.9, 170.0; HRMS calculated for C10H20N2O m/z 184.1577, found 184.1577. Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) followed the oxidation reaction of spermidine by BPAO in phosphate buffer (D2O, pH 7.2) using 1H NMR monitoring at various time points (up to 200 h) and observed the production of putrescine and 3-aminopropanal, with concomitant decrease of spermidine. Because 3-aminopropanal undergoes deuterium-proton exchange at C-2 under the reaction condition owing to enolization (Equation 1), only two signals were observed, a singlet at δ 3.10 assigned to the C-3 proton and a singlet at δ 5.24 assigned to the C-1 position existing as the carbonyl hydrate (Equation 1). We incubated acrolein (2 mm) in 100 mmphosphate buffer (D2O, pH 7.2) in the presence of 20 mm ammonium (from NH4OH), which we considered (see “Experimental Procedures”) to simulate the initial product condition of the enzymatic conversion of spermidine (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the 1H NMR spectrum was recorded over a 3-day period. Two singlets at δ 3.10 and 5.21 grew as the signals corresponding to starting acrolein decreased. Although the chemical shifts of these two signals are consistent with those of 3-aminopropanal as assigned by Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) we felt the need to confirm the structure by isolation of the known 3-acetamidopropanol (17Fernandez S. Menendez E. Gotor V. Synthesis. 1991; : 713-716Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) when the reaction mixture was treated with NaBH4 followed by acetic anhydride trapping, as shown in Equation 2. As an alternative approach to resolving the question of primary versus secondary amine metabolism of polyamines by BPAO, we investigated homospermidine as a substrate to avert the complication of acrolein elimination following deamination. Being a symmetrical polyamine, oxidation of homospermidine at the primary amino group would give 4-(4-aminobutylamino)butanal (1) (and eventually 4,4′-iminodibutanal (2)), whereas oxidation at the secondary amino group would instead give 4-aminobutanal (3) and putrescine (4) (SchemeFS4). This study would unfortunately not be free of all complications, since aminobutyraldehydes are known to cyclize (19Hasse K. Schmid G. Biochem. Z. 1963; 337: 69-79PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jakoby W.B. Fredericks J. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2145-2150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, and to avoid any complicating intermolecular amine-carbonyl side reactions, we planned to conduct our product analysis following a sequential NaBH4/Ac2O quench prior to workup. Homospermidine was incubated with BPAO and catalase in 0.1m pH 7.2 phosphate buffer at room temperature. After 2 h, the mixture was quenched with NaBH4 at 0 °C. Excess acetic anhydride was added to the mixture while maintaining the pH at 10.5; then the pH was raised to 12.5 for 20 min, in order to hydrolyze any existing O-acetyl groups, and then lowered back to 10.5. Following workup, 1H NMR analysis of the crude product revealed a clean mixture of triacetylated homospermidine 5and 1-(4-acetamidobutyl)pyrrolidine (6) in a ratio of 5 to 1 (see Scheme FS4). A duplicate reaction incubated for 20 h before NaBH4 reduction and treated as described above afforded the same mixture of 5 and 6 in a ratio of 1.3 to 1, consistent with more extensive enzymatic conversion of starting homospermidine at the later time point. Isolation of 6 provides direct evidence for primary rather than secondary amine metabolism by BPAO according to Scheme FS4. Compound6 arises because the aldehyde 1 formed from deamination of the terminal amino group apparently exists totally as 1-(3-aminobutyl)pyrrolinium prior to the NaBH4/Ac2O quench; the diacetylated derivative of N-(3-hydroxybutyl)-1,4-butanediamine otherwise expected by direct quenching of aldehyde 1 was not observed. This finding is precedented by the identification of 1-(3-aminopropyl)-2-pyrroline in the oxidation products of spermidine by plant diamine oxidase (21Tabor H. Tabor C.W. Adv. Enzymol. 1972; 36: 203-268PubMed Google Scholar). The other possible product expected from metabolism of the terminal amino group, 1-(4-hydroxybutyl)pyrrolidine (7) was not seen at all in the reaction mixture. This indicates that there is still substantial unreacted substrate, so that the enzyme has not yet had a chance to carry out the second stage of oxidation. If the enzyme processed homospermidine at the secondary amino group, compounds 8 and/or 9 would have been isolated under the reaction condition and workup treatment. The complete absence of these materials indicates that metabolism at the secondary amino group did not occur. The structures of 5 and6 were confirmed by independent synthesis of authentic samples (see “Experimental Procedures”). We have demonstrated that 3-aminopropanal, observed as key evidence of oxidation of polyamines (spermine and spermidine) at the secondary amino group by BPAO, could also be generated under the conditions of oxidation at the primary amino group. This is because primary amine deamination of N-(aminopropyl) groups is followed by nonenzymatic elimination of acrolein, which can combine with the NH3 in solution. Our study on the metabolism of homospermidine, which is devoid of such complicating side reactions, revealed that BPAO processed this compound exclusively at the primary amino terminus. Therefore, the claim by Houen et al. (10Houen G. Bock K. Jensen A.L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that the metabolism of polyamines by PAO occurs principally at the secondary amine centers appears to be an artifact. It should be pointed out that if PAO really were a secondary amine metabolizer, it would be necessary to explain the regiochemical course in the case of unsymmetrical substrates; viz. in the case of spermine and spermidine, it would be unclear why the reaction gave 3-aminopropanal each time rather than 1,3-propanediamine and the corresponding 4-aminobutanal. Both regiochemistries have been observed for spermidine using one or another secondary amine metabolizer (21Tabor H. Tabor C.W. Adv. Enzymol. 1972; 36: 203-268PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of PAO, our results instead are in line with the earlier interpretation by the Tabor group (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Bachrach U. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2194-2203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that metabolism of polyamines occurs at terminal amino groups. In addition, we have been unable to substantiate any other claims (6Anthony D.C. Amarnath V. Graham D.G. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1989; 48: 348Crossref Google Scholar,7Wilmarth K.R. Froines J.R. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1991; 32: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) that PAO can metabolize secondary amines. Since model studies confirm that secondary amines can undergo transaminative processing via a quinone iminium intermediate (22Lee Y. Huang H. Sayre L.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7241-7242Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the restriction of PAO to oxidation of primary amines must reflect a steric exclusion issue rather than an intrinsic chemical requirement. The steric explanation is not surprising in that, even for primary amines, PAO exhibits a strict preference for metabolism of unbranched primary amines to aldehydes—metabolism of branched primary amines to ketones has not been reported (23Mondovi B. Turini P. Befani O. Sabatini S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on this knowledge, we were surprised to find that the secondary amine 3-pyrroline and its 3-aryl derivatives induce mechanism-based inactivation of BPAO (22Lee Y. Huang H. Sayre L.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7241-7242Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although we could not detect any productive turnover in these cases, the observed inactivation indicates that BPAO can at least initially process these sterically “tied back” secondary amines. As structural information on the copper amine oxidases continues to be revealed (24Wilce M.C.J. Dooley D.M. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Matsunami H. McIntire W.S. Ruggiero C.E. Tanizawa K. Yamaguchi H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16116-16133Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), substrate structure requirements will eventually be understood in terms of the shapes and dimensions of the active site cavities."

The proteins that participate in these reactions were purified, and a specific protease and a single cofactor protein were identified. Functional characterization of the recombinantly expressed sand bass cofactor protein (SBP1) and truncated forms containing short consensus repeats (SCRs) 1–2, 1–3, 1–4, 1–5, and 12–17 revealed that SBP1 and SCRs 1–4 mediate the functional activities of the human plasma regulatory protein C4bp and factor H. They form a complex with C4b, inhibit the formation, and accelerate the decay of the classical pathway C3 convertase and display cofactor activity for the cleavage of C4b. In contrast, the interaction of SBP1 and SCRs 1–4 with human C3b in all these activities was limited. This difference is due to species-specific incompatibilities between the cofactor protein and human C3b. SBP1 and SCRs 1–5 displayed full binding and cofactor activity for methylamine-treated C3 from trout, a species closely related to the sand bass. The presence of only one cofactor in the fish plasma that combines the functional activities of C4bp and factor H demonstrates that the sand bass cofactor protein is the ancestral precursor to the two complement regulatory proteins in human plasma.

In vertebrates, cleavage of the third component of complement (C3) 1The abbreviations used are: C, complement; C4bp, C4b binding protein; SCR, short consensus repeat; SBP1, sand bass cofactor protein; SB1, sand bass cofactor protein cDNA clone; NHS, normal human serum; VBS, veronal-buffered saline; trout C3b-like, trout C3 converted into a C3b-like molecule by treatment with methylamine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and subsequent assembly of the membrane attack complex (C5–C9) occur as functions of at least two distinct enzymes generated during the activation of the classical (1Polley M.J. Müeller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1968; 128: 533-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and alternative (2Müeller-Eberhard H.J. Goetze O. J. Exp.

The classical pathway C3 convertase is formed by a reaction involving the reversible binding of C2 to C4b in the presence of Mg2+ to form the C4b2 complex and by the cleavage of the bound C2 by C1s to generate C4b2a (4Sitomer G. Stroud R.M. Mayer M.M. Immunochemistry. 1966; 3: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These reactions are remarkably similar to those occurring during the formation of the alternative pathway C3 convertase (2Müeller-Eberhard H.J. Goetze O. J. Exp. Med. 1972; 135: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 3Fearon D.T. Austen K.F. Ruddy S. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 138: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). C3b binds to factor B, which is then cleaved by factor D to generate C3bBb. The formation and function of these two enzymes are regulated by three distinct mechanisms as follows: a temperature-dependent intrinsic decay of the enzymes; an extrinsic decay mediated by the effect of the serum proteins C4-binding protein (C4bp) and factor H, and the proteolytic inactivation of the α′-chain of C4b and C3b by factor I. Binding of C4bp to C4b directly accelerates the decay of the C4b2a complex (5Nagasawa S. Stroud R.M. Immunochemistry. 1977; 14: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Fujita T. Gigli I.

A. 1979; 76: 6596-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and prevents further interaction of C4b with C2. Similarly, factor H prevents binding of factor B to C3b and dissociates Bb from the C3bBb complex (8Pangburn M.K. Müeller-Eberhard H.J. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1984; 7: 163-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition, C4bp and factor H function as cofactors for the plasma protease factor I that mediates the degradation of C4b and C3b (5Nagasawa S. Stroud R.M. Immunochemistry. 1977; 14: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Fujita T. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 9Law S.K. Fearon D.T. Levine R.P. J. Immunol. 1979; 122: 759-765PubMed Google Scholar). During this reaction the α′-chain of C4b is cleaved into three fragments of 48 (α2), 33 (α3), and 27 (α3) kDa (10Nagasawa S. Ichihara C. Stroud R.M. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 578-582PubMed Google Scholar). The α′-chain of C3b is first cleaved into two polypeptides of approximately 68 and 46 kDa, followed by a second cleavage of the 68-kDa peptide to a 38- and 30-kDa fragment (5Nagasawa S. Stroud R.M. Immunochemistry. 1977; 14: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,9Law S.K. Fearon D.T. Levine R.P. J. Immunol. 1979; 122: 759-765PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian C4bp is composed of seven identical 75-kDa subunits (α-chains), each of which displays the complement regulatory function, and one distinct β-chain of 45 kDa (11Kai S. Fujita T. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2409-2415PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dahlback B. Biochem. J. 1984; 209: 847-856Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Human factor H is an elongated single chain glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 150 kDa (13Sim R.B. DiScipio R.B. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Human factor H (14Ripoche J. Day A.J. Harris T.J.R. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and the α-chains of C4bp (15Chung L.P. Bentley D.R. Reid K.B.M. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Hillarp A. Dahlback B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) are organized in tandem structural units of approximately 60 amino acids, termed short consensus repeats (SCR) (17Kristensen T. D'Eustachio P. Ogata R.T. Chung L.P. Reid K.B.M. Tack B.F. Fed. Proc. 1987; 46: 2463-2469PubMed Google Scholar, 18Janatova J. Reid K.B.M. Willis A.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4754-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Factor H consists of 20 SCRs, and each α-chain of C4bp consists of 8 CSRs and a unique non-SCR C terminus. These repetitive structural elements are found in most plasma or membrane complement regulatory proteins (19Reid K.B.M. Day A.J. Immunol. Today. 1989; 7: 230-234Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and in a number of non-complement proteins with diverse functions, suggesting that their corresponding genes may have evolved early from an ancestral SCR sequence (20Farries T.C. Atkinson J.P. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 295-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic studies of the complement system have proved difficult. Even when the structure of complement proteins of different species is known, the elucidation of their functional properties has been hampered by incompatibilities among complement proteins of heterologous species. The α′-chain of human C4b and C3b is cleaved by the sera of a number of low vertebrates (21Kaidoh T. Gigli I. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 194-201PubMed Google Scholar), the most primitive of which is the teleost fish barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer). We have purified and characterized the proteins that participate in these reactions (22Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Contrary to the findings in higher vertebrates (5Nagasawa S. Stroud R.M. Immunochemistry. 1977; 14: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7Gigli I. Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6596-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar,11Kai S. Fujita T. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2409-2415PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kaidoh T. Gigli I. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1605-1613PubMed Google Scholar), only a single protein serves as cofactor for factor I in the cleavage of C4b and C3b. The cofactor activity correlates with a 110-kDa polypeptide chain of a 360-kDa plasma protein (22Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The corresponding cDNA, representing the 110-kDa polypeptide chain, encodes for a sand bass cofactor protein (SBP1) of 1053 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 115 kDa. SBP1 has a hydrophobic signal peptide indicative of a secreted translation product, and the remaining part of the molecule is organized in 17 SCRs. A structural comparison of SBP1 (24Dahmen A. Kaidoh T. Zipfel P.F. Gigli I. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to the complement regulatory proteins factor H (14Ripoche J. Day A.J. Harris T.J.R. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and C4bp (16Hillarp A. Dahlback B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Dahlback B. Smith C.A. Müeller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3461-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) revealed significant homology which exceeded that expected due to structurally conserved amino acids (24Dahmen A. Kaidoh T. Zipfel P.F. Gigli I. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether SBP1 expresses all the functional activities of the two human regulatory proteins, we characterized and localized the functional domains within the protein. Recombinantly expressed SBP1 and truncated forms obtained by the consecutive deletion of SCRs from the C terminus of the molecule were analyzed for binding to human C4b and C3b, inhibition of the formation, and decay accelerating activity for C4b2a and C3bBb and cofactor activity in the cleavage of C4b and C3b. The functional domains of SBP1 were localized to SCRs 1–4. P. nebulifer (GIRARD, 1856; class, Osteichthyes; order, Perciformies; family, Serranidae; subfamily, Anthiinae; genus, Paralabrax; species, Paralabrax nebulifer; common name, barred sand bass) were captured in the Pacific Ocean. The fish were bled by puncturing the caudal artery, and the blood was collected into a syringe containing EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. The plasma was separated by centrifugation and immediately frozen at −70 °C. The preparation and screening conditions of the sand bass liver cDNA library have been described (24Dahmen A. Kaidoh T. Zipfel P.F. Gigli I. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA coding for the sand bass cofactor protein SBP1 was obtained by ligating the BSTEII-restricted overlapping fragments c90 and c120. cDNA fragments were amplified in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using Taq-polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and sequence-specific primers (26). After 30 cycles of amplification (Perkin-Elmer thermocycler: five cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 46 °C, 1 min at 72 °C; 25 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C), the amplified product was cloned into vector pCR II (Invitrogen). A PCR-generated NotI/SmaI-restricted cDNA (SB1) representing SCRs 1–17 of SBP1 was inserted into theNotI/SmaI-treated baculovirus expression vector pBSV-8His (27Kühn S. Zipfel P.F. Gene ( Amst .). 1995; 162: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The presence of a vector-encoded signal peptide upstream from the multiple cloning site and a C-terminal His-tag allows the expression of a secreted His-tagged recombinant protein. PCR-generated cDNAs representing SCRs 1–5, SCRs 1–4, SCRs 1–3, SCRs 1–2, and SCRs 12–17 of SBP1 were cloned into the pBSV-8His vector with the same restriction sites as used for the full-length cofactor protein. The purified cDNA inserts were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar), using [α-35S]thio-dATP and Sequenase II (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) Various oligonucleotides were synthesized (gene assembler-1; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as primers to sequence the cDNA inserts in both orientations. Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) (American Type Culture Collection) were grown at 27 °C in monolayer culture, in Grace's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 mg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and fungizone (250 ng/ml) or in fetal calf serum-free Express medium (BioWhittaker). The plasmid-DNA used to transfect the insect cells was purified using Nucleobond AX cartridges (Macherey-Nagel). Sf9 cells (6 × 105 cells) in a 35-mm cell culture dish were cotransfected with the appropriate plasmid (2 μg) and baculovirus DNA (0.5 μg of BaculoGold DNA, PharMingen) according to a calcium phosphate precipitation method modified for insect cells (29Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated for 4–6 days, and the recombinant virus was isolated from the culture medium by plaque assay (30Lee H.H. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1978; 27: 754-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single plaques were purified after 5 days, and viruses were used to infect Sf9 cells (3 × 106 cells) grown in 25 ml of Express medium using a multiplicity of infection of 5. The culture medium was harvested 9 days after infection, and the recombinant protein was purified from the supernatant by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography (31Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar). The resin was added to the supernatant and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C, pelleted by centrifugation (450 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), washed twice with 10-bed volumes of buffer A (0.5m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm imidazole), and then once with 6-bed volumes of buffer B (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm imidazole). The recombinant protein was eluted by incubating the resin twice in buffer C (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 m imidazole) and once in buffer D (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm EDTA). The proteins eluted in buffer C and in buffer D were combined, dialyzed twice against 4 liters of 1× vernal-buffered saline (VBS), and concentrated by centrifugation with Biomax 5K filters (Millipore). The protein concentration was determined by Bradford analysis (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Recombinantly expressed SCRs 1–5 of SBP1 (200 μg) were injected into a rabbit, and then the animal was injected twice at 2-week intervals with 100 μg of protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Another injection was given 4 weeks later. Serum was collected 2 weeks after the last injection and was tested with the recombinant protein as well as the sand bass plasma. The recognition of SBP1, SCRs 1–2, 1–3, 1–4, and 1–5 by the rabbit anti-SCRs 1–5 antibodies was carefully quantitated. An affinity purified rabbit antibody raised against the purified plasma cofactor protein (23Kaidoh T. Gigli I. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1605-1613PubMed Google Scholar) was used to detect SCRs 12–17. Polyclonal antisera raised against SCRs 1–7 of human factor H (31Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar) and C4bp (7Gigli I. Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6596-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) were used to detect factor H and C4bp, respectively. The polyclonal antiserum raised against purified C3 from rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) was a generous gift from John D. Lambris, University of Pennsylvania (33Sunyer J.O. Zarkadis I.K. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8546-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) with 7.5 or 10% separating gels or a gradient gel (8–12%). Prestained broad range markers were purchased from Bio-Rad. Proteins were visualized by silver staining (35Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1986; 6: 103-108Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar) or were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes by a semi-dry technique (36Khyse-Andersen J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min and incubated overnight with either a specific polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against SBP1 (23Kaidoh T. Gigli I. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1605-1613PubMed Google Scholar) or a recombinantly expressed peptide representing SCRs 1–5 of SBP1. The membranes were washed five times in PBS and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Ab (Dako) for 3 h. Protein bands were visualized by the addition of 0.3% (w/v) 4-chloro-1-naphthol in 10% (v/v) methanol in PBS and 50 ml of H2O2. Proteins were also analyzed by the dot blot technique (37Hawkes R. Niday E. Gordon J. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) with the Bio-Rad apparatus and visualized according to the same procedure described above. Human C2, C3, C3b, C4, factor H, factor B, and factor D were purchased from Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego, CA). C1, C1s, and C4bp were purified by published techniques (38Scharstein J. Ferreira A. Gigli I. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 39Ziccardi R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6187-6192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Normal human serum (NHS) diluted 1:10 in EDTA GVB was used as a source of C5–C9. Normal trout serum and purified trout C3 was generously provided by Dr. John D. Lambris (33Sunyer J.O. Zarkadis I.K. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8546-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Human C4, human C3b, and trout C3 were labeled with 125I using the IODO-GEN technique (40Gigli I. Sorvillo J. Mecarelli-Halbwachs L. Leibowitch J. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the labeled proteins was 13 × 106 cpm/μg of trout C3, 2 × 106 cpm/μg of C3b, and 1 × 105 cpm/μg of C4. C4b was generated from 125I-C4 (200 μg) by incubation with 10 μg of highly purified C1s. Trout C3 was converted into a C3b-like molecule (termed trout C3b-like) by incubating 20 μg of C3 with 100 mm methylamine (Sigma), pH 7.6, for 90 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl. Excess methylamine was removed by dialysis against VBS containing 10 mmCaCl2. During this treatment the α-chain of C3 remained intact. The cofactor protein in sand bass serum was removed by passing 2 ml of the serum containing 10 mm EDTA through a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column or an immunoabsorbed column prepared with the IgG fraction of rabbit anti-cofactor protein antiserum cross-linked to Sepharose. The procedure was repeated three times. The effluents from both procedures contained cofactor-depleted sand bass serum, as assessed immunologically and functionally. Sensitized sheep erythrocytes (EA) were prepared as described (7Gigli I. Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6596-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To generate EAC14b, 1 × 109 EA were incubated with 50 μg of C1 in 1 ml of DGVB2+ for 30 min at 4 °C and then washed twice with ice-cold VBS containing 75 mm dextrose, 0.1% gelatin, 0.015 mm cells, and 0.05 mm Mg2+(DGVB2+), resuspended in 1 ml of buffer, and incubated with 100 μg of C4 for 20 min at 30 °C. To generate EAC14b2a, EAC14b were washed, diluted in DGVB2+ to a concentration of 1 × 108 cells/ml, and incubated with an equal volume of C2 (5 μg of C2/1 × 10 cells) diluted in the same buffer for 10 min at 30 °C. EC3b were generated by incubating sheep erythrocytes (5 × 108) with 350 μg of C3, 20 μg of factor B, and 0.5 μg of factor D in VBS containing 0.1% gelatin and 2 mm NiCl2 (Ni-GVB, veronal-buffered saline containing 0.1% gelatin and 2 mm NiCl2) for 20 min at 21 °C. The cells were washed twice with Ni-GVB, and 20 μg of factor B and 0.5 μg of factor D were added. Additional C3b was deposited by incubating the cells with 350 μg of C3 for 20 min at 21 °C. The cells were washed and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C to allow complete decay of the remaining convertase. To measure the activity of cell-bound C4b2a or C3bBb, a 50-μl portion of each cellular intermediate (1 × 108 cells/ml) was incubated with an equal volume of NHS-EDTA diluted 1:10 as source of C5–9 for 1 h at 37 °C. After the addition of 650 μl of GDVB2+ to each sample, the mixtures were centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g, and the supernatants were analyzed photometrically atA414 to determine the hemoglobin released. The cleavage of human 125I-C4b, human125I-C3b, and trout 125I-C3b-like was measured as follows: 2 μg of 125I-C4b or 125I-C3b was added to 50 μl of cofactor-depleted sand bass serum diluted 1:4 in VBS containing 10 mm CaCl2. After addition of 200 nm SBP1 or SCRs 1–2, 1–3, 1–4, 1–5, or 12–17 diluted in 25 μl of the same buffer, the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. As controls, 125I-C4b and125I-C3b were incubated with NHS, sand bass cofactor-depleted serum, or buffer alone. Samples were reduced and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. In a separate experiment 1 μg of trout 125I-C3b-like was added to 25 μl of the following reagents: NHS, trout serum, sand bass serum, sand bass cofactor-depleted serum, and sand bass cofactor-depleted serum plus 100 nm SCRs 1–5. The mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C and reduced and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Human125I-C3b was used as control. The cofactor activity of the various plasma samples was quantitated by counting the radioactivity in the polypeptides generated from the α′-chains of human125I-C4b, 125I-C3b, and trout125I-C3b-like and normalized using the radioactivity present in the β-chain of the same sample. To localize and characterize further the functional domains in SBP1, SBP1 and truncated forms of SBP1 consisting of SCRs 1–2, 1–3, 1–4, 1–5, and 12–17 were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells. The various secreted His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 1). The recombinant proteins and peptides contain an interokinase cleavage site and a His tag with a calculated molecular mass of 3.2 kDa. The apparent molecular masses of each of the proteins SBP1 and SCRs 1–2, 1–3, 1–4, 1–5, and 12–17 were 115, 13.5, 20.5, 28, 35.5 and 43 kDa, respectively. The data are in close agreement with the molecular masses predicted for each protein based on amino acid composition. The binding of SBP1 to human C3b and C4b and the localization of the binding domains within SBP1 were analyzed by incubating the various proteins with immobilized C4b and C3b. Serial dilutions of 5 μg of human C4b and C4 and human C3b and C3 were bound to nitrocellulose membranes. The filters were blocked and then incubated with either 200 nm recombinant SBP1 or equimolar amounts of each of the five truncated forms of SBP1 diluted in VBS containing 10 mm CaCl2. Equimolar amounts of human C4bp and human factor H were used as positive controls. The membranes were washed and incubated with specific polyclonal antiserum raised against the recombinantly expressed SCRs 1–5 of SBP1; the sand bass cofactor protein was purified from the fish plasma, human factor H, or human C4bp, and the reaction was developed as described. At the same molar concentration, SBP1 and SCRs 1–5, 1–4, and 1–3 displayed the same binding activity for human C4b as shown with C4bp, whereas SCRs 1–2 and 12–17 failed to bind (Table I). SBP1 and SCRs 1–5 and 1–4 bound only 15% of the amount of C3b bound by factor H. The strong binding to C4b and the weak binding to C3b is in good agreement with previous data obtained with the cofactor protein purified from sand bass plasma (23Kaidoh T. Gigli I. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1605-1613PubMed Google Scholar). SCRs 1–2, 1–3, and 12–17 did not bind to human C3b. Neither SBP1 nor any of the mutants tested reacted with the nonactivated complement proteins C4 and C3 (data not shown). Because the noted weak binding of SBP1 to human C3b may be due to the use of a heterologous substrate, the same experiments were performed with trout C3b-like. SBP1 and SCRs 1–4 and 1–5 displayed 100% binding activity (Table I). None of the proteins bound to nonactivated trout C3 (data not shown).Table IBinding activity of SBP1 and the truncated forms SCRs 1–2, 1–3, 1–4, 1–5, and 12–17 to human C4b, C3b, and trout C3b-likeBinding to human C4baProtein binding to human C4bp was 100% and to human factor H was 0%.Binding to human C3bbProtein binding to human C4bp was 0% and to human factor H was 100%.Binding to trout C3b-likecProtein binding to human C4bp was 0% and to human factor H was 0%.%%%SBP110015100SCRs 1–200NDSCRs 1–31000NDSCRs 1–410015100SCRs 1–510015100SCRs 12–1700NDHuman C4b, C3b, and trout C3b-like were immobilized onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with equimolar amounts of SBP1 or truncated forms of SBP1.

Open table in a new tab Human C4b, C3b, and trout C3b-like were immobilized onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with equimolar amounts of SBP1 or truncated forms of SBP1. The binding activity to human C4b and C3b and to trout C3b-like was assessed using as standards the binding of human C4bp to C4b and of factor H to C3b at the same molar concentrations. ND, not done. The previous experiments demonstrated the direct binding of SBP1 and SCRs 1–5, 1–4, and 1–3 to C4b and to lesser extent to C3b but did not address the functional outcome of these interactions. To elucidate whether these proteins participate in the regulation of the formation of the C3 convertases (C4b2a and C3bBb), the following experiments were performed. EC3b and EAC14b were generated and resuspended to a concentration of 1 × 108 cells/ml in Ni-GVB (EC3b) or DGVB2+ (EAC14b). Portions of EC3b and EAC14b were incubated with an equal volume of buffer containing either SBP1 or SCRs 1–2, 1–3, 1–4, 1–5, or 12–17 in equimolar concentrations. C4bp and factor H were used as controls with EAC14b and EC3b, respectively. The hemolytic activity of each sample was measured by the ability to generate C4b2a in the presence of a limited C2 input or C3bBb after the addition of factors B and D, and the reactions were developed by adding NHS-EDTA. The generation of C4b2a was markedly reduced in the samples in which the EAC14b cells were incubated with SBP1, SCRs 1–4, or 1–5 of SBP1 (Fig. 2 A). This inhibition was concentration-dependent and of the same extent as that obtained with C4bp. SCRs 1–3 partially inhibited the formation of the classical pathway C3 convertase (25%), and SCRs 1–2 and 12–17 had no effect. The effect of SBP1 and the truncated forms on the formation of C3bBb is shown in Fig. 2 B. Incubation with SBP1 and SCRs 1–4, 1–5, and 1–3 resulted in inhibition of lysis but to a lesser degree than that obtained with factor H (SBP1, SCRs 1–5, and 1–4 to 30% and SCRs 1–3 to 10%); SCRs 1–2 and 12–17 had no effect. The effects of SBP1 and SCRs 1–2, 1–5, and 12–17 on the decay of EAC14a2b and C3bBb were investigated kinetically. EAC14b2a and EC3bBb were prepared as described. The cells were washed in ice-cold buffer and resuspended to 1 × 108 cells/ml, and each cellular intermediate was divided into equal samples. One aliquot of EAC14b2a and one of EC3bBb received an equal volume of buffer, and the other samples received equal volumes of buffer containing equimolar concentrations of SBP1, SCRs 1–5, or SCRs 12–17.

RNAPs are large, multisubunit protein complexes. The best studied RNAP, fromEscherichia coli (>400 kDa), contains four core polypeptides: β′ (155 kDa), β (150 kDa), a dimer of α (37 kDa), and one of several possible ς (specificity) subunits. RNAPs from other bacteria have similar subunit composition and exhibit striking and co-linear sequence similarities with the E. coli enzyme (1Buhler J.-M. Riva M. Mann C. Thuriaux P. Memet S.

Our previous analysis using E. coli RNAP showed that such a β-β′ fusion is compatible with RNAP function: (i) the product of artificially fused rpoB andrpoC genes of E. coli could assemble into a functional RNAP in vivo and in vitro and (ii) anE. coli strain containing the fused rpoBC gene as its only source for RNAP was viable and contained RNAP of the expected (β-β′)α2 subunit composition (9Severinov K. Mooney R. Darst S.A. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24137-24140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This tethering ofE. coli β and β′ increased the efficiency of RNAP assembly in vitro and suppressed anrpoC ts assembly mutation in vivo. 3T. Naryshkina and K. Severinov, unpublished observations. 3T. Naryshkina and K. Severinov, unpublished observations. It thus seemed that natural tethering could be advantageous for an organism likeH. pylori that needs to colonize the stomach, an intrinsically acid-rich and putatively hostile environment (10Fox J.G. Semin. Gastrointest. Dis. 1997; 8: 124-141PubMed Google Scholar). However, RNAP had never been purified from H. pylori, and therefore post-translational proteolysis of fused β-β′ protein followed by assembly into “normal” RNAP with a ββ′α2 subunit composition could not be ruled outa priori.H. pylori belongs to the ε group of proteobacteria (10Fox J.G. Semin. Gastrointest. Dis. 1997; 8: 124-141PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of H. pylori, no rpoBC gene sequences from this group of bacteria were known. Thus, it seemed possible that rpoBC fusion could be (i) characteristic of ε proteobacteria in general; (ii) a specific feature of theHelicobacter genus; (iii) an accidental feature of theH. pylori species; or (iv) an accidental feature of the particular H. pylori strain that was sequenced. To assess these possibilities, we sequenced the rpoB-rpoC junction in four different strains of H. pylori, in an isolate ofHelicobacter felis (11Eaton K.A. Dewhirst F.E. Radin M.J. Fox J.G. Paster B.J. Krakowka S. Morgan D.R. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1993; 43: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and in two species of the related genus Campylobacter. In addition, we purifed and characterized the product of rpoBC gene from H. pylori 26695.Our results establish that in H. pylori 26695 therpoB-rpoC gene does in fact encode a fused β-β′ polypeptide. In addition, we find that translational fusion ofrpoBC genes is characteristic of two gastricHelicobacters but not of Campylobacter jejuni andCampylobacter fetus, members of a related genus that colonize nongastric sites. We suggest that the β-β′ tethering inHelicobacter might (i) be an accident of evolution because of a frameshift mutation in an ancestor that, like currentCampylobacters, contained overlapping but separaterpoB and rpoC genes or (ii) help gastric organisms cope with their acid- and urea-rich niche.DISCUSSIONThe principal conclusion of this work is that a single fused RNAPrpoB-rpoC gene is a regular feature of at least two species of gastric helicobacters, H. pylori and H. felis, and that the gene product, a 300-kDa β-β′ fusion protein is the predominant or only form of this gene product in vivo. Because no proteins in H. pylori lysates that would comigrate with separate RNAP β and β′ subunits were detected, the fused subunit is probably not extensively proteolyzed; it is likely to be the only source of RNAP β and β′ in the cell, as is also the case for an E. coli strain with a β-β′ fusion RNAP that we had engineered to study holoenzyme topology and assembly (9Severinov K. Mooney R. Darst S.A. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24137-24140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).No transcriptional activity was found in fractions of H. pylori extract containing the β-β′ fused protein under standard conditions that had been optimized for E. coli RNAP transcription in vitro, although similarly prepared RNAP-containing fractions from extracts of E. coli and also of C. jejuni were active under our assay conditions. It is known that RNAPs from different eubacterial species can have markedly different requirements for efficient transcription in vitro (21Stetter K.O. Zillig W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Murray C.L. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5153-5161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Whipple F.W. Sonenshein A.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and hence, the inactivity of H. pylori RNAP under our present conditions may reflect an unusual buffer or salt requirement and conditions in the gastric environment in which it grows. Because H. pylori is a fastidious microbe and rather difficult to grow in large quantities, we have not yet purified the large amounts of H. pylori RNAP that should facilitate establishing a system for transcription by this RNAP in vitro.Although H. pylori is extremely diverse as a species, our DNA sequencing results establish that the rpoBC fusion is not just a peculiar feature of the one H. pylori strain that was chosen for the genome project (26695), but rather it is a common feature of H. pylori in general and indeed of at least one other gastric helicobacter. In contrast, rpoB andrpoC are separate genes in the closely related genus,Campylobacter. The Campylobacter genus is also unusual among Gram-negative bacteria, however, because itsrpoB and rpoC genes overlap by two codons. A frameshift mutation at or shortly before the overlap area might have created the continuous open reading frame found in present day helicobacters. Alternatively, a frameshift mutation in aHelicobacter-like ancestral rpoBC gene might have created separate but overlapping genes of present day campylobacters. A number of nongastric helicobacters and also members of closely related genera that colonize gastric and nongastric sites have been discovered recently (10Fox J.G. Semin. Gastrointest. Dis. 1997; 8: 124-141PubMed Google Scholar, 24Suarez D.L. Wesley I.V. Larson D. J. Vet. Microbiol. 1997; 57: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and DNA sequence analyses similar to those carried out here should help us learn how these unusual arrangements of RNAP subunit genes have evolved.The functional significance of the rpoBC fusion is not known. In organisms with transcriptional-translational coupling, therpoB and rpoC genes are always found in the same operon, suggesting that RNAP assembly in the cell may occur contranslationally. Fusion of the two genes may further increase RNAP assembly efficiency. In E. coli, the β-β′ fusion appears to stabilize RNAP in vitro and in vivo.3 Thus the fusion could be advantageous for gastric helicobacters, which must grow in the putatively hostile, acid-rich stomach environment. On the other hand, many acidophilic archaea have separate rpoB- and rpoC-like subunits and in fact contain natural splits in their β- and β′-like subunits (7Pühler G. Leffers H. Gropp F. Palm P.

The genome sequence of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori (strain 26695) revealed one continuous open reading frame containing the homologs of rpoB and rpoC, potentially encoding one fused 2890-amino acid-long β-β′ polypeptide (8Tomb J.F. White O. Kerlavage A.R. Clayton R.A. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Ketchum K.A. Klenk H.P. Gill S. Dougherty B.A. Nelson K. Quackenbush J. Zhou L. Kirkness E.F. Peterson S. Loftus B. Richardson D.

Our previous analysis using E. coli RNAP showed that such a β-β′ fusion is compatible with RNAP function: (i) the product of artificially fused rpoB andrpoC genes of E. coli could assemble into a functional RNAP in vivo and in vitro and (ii) anE. coli strain containing the fused rpoBC gene as its only source for RNAP was viable and contained RNAP of the expected (β-β′)α2 subunit composition (9Severinov K. Mooney R. Darst S.A. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24137-24140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This tethering ofE. coli β and β′ increased the efficiency of RNAP assembly in vitro and suppressed anrpoC ts assembly mutation in vivo. 3T. Naryshkina and K. Severinov, unpublished observations. 3T. Naryshkina and K. Severinov, unpublished observations. It thus seemed that natural tethering could be advantageous for an organism likeH. pylori that needs to colonize the stomach, an intrinsically acid-rich and putatively hostile environment (10Fox J.G. Semin. Gastrointest. Dis. 1997; 8: 124-141PubMed Google Scholar). However, RNAP had never been purified from H. pylori, and therefore post-translational proteolysis of fused β-β′ protein followed by assembly into “normal” RNAP with a ββ′α2 subunit composition could not be ruled outa priori. H. pylori belongs to the ε group of proteobacteria (10Fox J.G. Semin. Gastrointest. Dis. 1997; 8: 124-141PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of H. pylori, no rpoBC gene sequences from this group of bacteria were known. Thus, it seemed possible that rpoBC fusion could be (i) characteristic of ε proteobacteria in general; (ii) a specific feature of theHelicobacter genus; (iii) an accidental feature of theH. pylori species; or (iv) an accidental feature of the particular H. pylori strain that was sequenced. To assess these possibilities, we sequenced the rpoB-rpoC junction in four different strains of H. pylori, in an isolate ofHelicobacter felis (11Eaton K.A. Dewhirst F.E. Radin M.J. Fox J.G. Paster B.J. Krakowka S. Morgan D.R. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1993; 43: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and in two species of the related genus Campylobacter. In addition, we purifed and characterized the product of rpoBC gene from H. pylori 26695. Our results establish that in H. pylori 26695 therpoB-rpoC gene does in fact encode a fused β-β′ polypeptide. In addition, we find that translational fusion ofrpoBC genes is characteristic of two gastricHelicobacters but not of Campylobacter jejuni andCampylobacter fetus, members of a related genus that colonize nongastric sites. We suggest that the β-β′ tethering inHelicobacter might (i) be an accident of evolution because of a frameshift mutation in an ancestor that, like currentCampylobacters, contained overlapping but separaterpoB and rpoC genes or (ii) help gastric organisms cope with their acid- and urea-rich niche. DISCUSSIONThe principal conclusion of this work is that a single fused RNAPrpoB-rpoC gene is a regular feature of at least two species of gastric helicobacters, H. pylori and H. felis, and that the gene product, a 300-kDa β-β′ fusion protein is the predominant or only form of this gene product in vivo. Because no proteins in H. pylori lysates that would comigrate with separate RNAP β and β′ subunits were detected, the fused subunit is probably not extensively proteolyzed; it is likely to be the only source of RNAP β and β′ in the cell, as is also the case for an E. coli strain with a β-β′ fusion RNAP that we had engineered to study holoenzyme topology and assembly (9Severinov K. Mooney R. Darst S.A. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24137-24140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).No transcriptional activity was found in fractions of H. pylori extract containing the β-β′ fused protein under standard conditions that had been optimized for E. coli RNAP transcription in vitro, although similarly prepared RNAP-containing fractions from extracts of E. coli and also of C. jejuni were active under our assay conditions. It is known that RNAPs from different eubacterial species can have markedly different requirements for efficient transcription in vitro (21Stetter K.O. Zillig W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Murray C.L. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5153-5161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Whipple F.W. Sonenshein A.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and hence, the inactivity of H. pylori RNAP under our present conditions may reflect an unusual buffer or salt requirement and conditions in the gastric environment in which it grows. Because H. pylori is a fastidious microbe and rather difficult to grow in large quantities, we have not yet purified the large amounts of H. pylori RNAP that should facilitate establishing a system for transcription by this RNAP in vitro.Although H. pylori is extremely diverse as a species, our DNA sequencing results establish that the rpoBC fusion is not just a peculiar feature of the one H. pylori strain that was chosen for the genome project (26695), but rather it is a common feature of H. pylori in general and indeed of at least one other gastric helicobacter. In contrast, rpoB andrpoC are separate genes in the closely related genus,Campylobacter. The Campylobacter genus is also unusual among Gram-negative bacteria, however, because itsrpoB and rpoC genes overlap by two codons. A frameshift mutation at or shortly before the overlap area might have created the continuous open reading frame found in present day helicobacters. Alternatively, a frameshift mutation in aHelicobacter-like ancestral rpoBC gene might have created separate but overlapping genes of present day campylobacters. A number of nongastric helicobacters and also members of closely related genera that colonize gastric and nongastric sites have been discovered recently (10Fox J.G. Semin. Gastrointest. Dis. 1997; 8: 124-141PubMed Google Scholar, 24Suarez D.L. Wesley I.V. Larson D. J. Vet.

In organisms with transcriptional-translational coupling, therpoB and rpoC genes are always found in the same operon, suggesting that RNAP assembly in the cell may occur contranslationally. Fusion of the two genes may further increase RNAP assembly efficiency. In E. coli, the β-β′ fusion appears to stabilize RNAP in vitro and in vivo.3 Thus the fusion could be advantageous for gastric helicobacters, which must grow in the putatively hostile, acid-rich stomach environment. On the other hand, many acidophilic archaea have separate rpoB- and rpoC-like subunits and in fact contain natural splits in their β- and β′-like subunits (7Pühler G. Leffers H. Gropp F. Palm P.

https://openalex.org/W2072438928,"Liver microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) is a multicomponent system involving both substrate and product carriers and a catalytic subunit. We have investigated the inhibitory effect of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a rather specific sulfhydryl reagent, on rat liver Glc-6-Pase activity. Three thiol groups are important for Glc-6-Pase system activity. Two of them are located in the glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) translocase, and one is located in the catalytic subunit. The other transporters (phosphate and glucose) are not affected by NEM treatment. The NEM alkylation of the catalytic subunit sulfhydryl residue is prevented by preincubating the disrupted microsomes with saturating concentrations of substrate or product. This suggests either that the modified cysteine is located in the protein active site or that substrate binding hides the thiol group via a conformational change in the enzyme structure. Two other thiols important for the Glc-6-Pase system activity are located in the Glc-6-P translocase and are more reactive than the one located in the catalytic subunit. The study of the NEM inhibition of the translocase has provided evidence of the existence of two distinct areas in the protein that can behave independently, with conformational changes occurring during Glc-6-P binding to the transporter. The recent cloning of a human putative Glc-6-P carrier exhibiting homologies with bacterial phosphoester transporters, such as Escherichia coli UhpT (a Glc-6-P translocase), is compatible with the fact that two cysteine residues are important for the bacterial Glc-6-P transport."

We demonstrate here a novel interaction between specific oxidized lipids derived from ox-LDL and PDGF.

Reverse-phase and normal-phase HPLC were used to purify the inactivating component in the lipid mixture. By fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy, we identified the inactivating lipids as the 9- and 13-hydroperoxy derivatives of cholesteryl linoleate, cholesteryl hydroperoxyoctadecadienoate. When a series of cholesteryl esters were subjected to oxidizing conditions, only those containing two or more double bonds caused inactivation of PDGF; the extent of inactivation increased with increased levels of oxidation. Exposing PDGF to cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, or hydrogen peroxide did not affect the activity of the mitogen. The oxidized lipid had no effect on the mitogenic activity of epidermal growth factor but did abolish the mitogenic activity of basic fibroblast growth factor and the antiproliferative activity of transforming growth factor β1.

Inappropriate production of PDGF by EC following injury or activation in vivo may play a significant role in the development of the atherosclerotic lesion by increasing the proliferation and migration of neighboring smooth muscle cells, a key event in lesion formation (7Raines, E. W., Bowen-Pope, D. F., and Ross, R. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology (Sporn, M. B., and Roberts, A. B., eds) Vol. 951, pp. 173–262, Springer-Verlag, New York.Google Scholar). PDGF production by cultured EC is constitutive but is stimulated by injury as well as exposure to a number of agents, such as lipopolysaccharide (8Fox P.L. DiCorleto P.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 121: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), phorbol esters (8Fox P.L. DiCorleto P.E. J. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). EC production of active PDGF is also specifically inhibited under certain culture conditions. Initial observations from our laboratory showed that chemically modified LDL, such as acetylated LDL or oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), completely inhibited the production of active PDGF from bovine aortic EC without affecting total protein synthesis (10Fox P.L. Chisolm G.M. DiCorleto P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6046-6054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Native LDL or its lipid extract had no effect on production of active PDGF by bovine aortic EC. In the present report, we demonstrate that the lipid moiety of ox-LDL is capable of inactivating PDGF. We have also purified and characterized the major PDGF inactivating component from the lipid extract of ox-LDL. This lipid component, cholesteryl hydroperoxyoctadecadienoate (cholesteryl HPODE) has been identified as the major oxidation product in LDL that has been oxidized by activated human monocytes (11Folcik V.A. Cathcart M.K. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1570-1582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, cholesteryl HPODE was detected, using the same detection system described in this report, in all human atherosclerotic lesions analyzed (n = 80), regardless of the type of lesion or stage of progression (12Folcik V.A. Nivar-Aristy R.A. Krajewski L.P. Cathcart M.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 404-510Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The inactivation of PDGF by this component of ox-LDL, as well as other oxidized lipids, may occur in lesion development and/or the process of inflammation and wound healing. LDL was isolated from human plasma by differential ultracentrifugation at 1.019 < d < 1.063 (13Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). LDL was oxidized in vitroby dialysis against 0.9% NaCl, 5 μm CuSO4for 6–8 h at 37 °C; ox-LDL was then lyophilized, and lipids were extracted with diethyl ether. Recovery of total cholesterol in the extract was consistently greater than 90%. Cholesteryls stearate, oleate, linoleate, linolenate, arachidate, and arachidonate (Sigma) were subjected to oxidizing conditions by exposure to air in a 37 °C water bath for 48–72 h. Lipid peroxidation was measured as thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) by a modification (14Morel D.W. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M.

Cholesterol and cholesteryl ester masses were determined by the ferric chloride method of Zak et al. (16Zak B. Moss N.M. Boyle A.J. Zlatkis A. Anal.

HPLC analyses were performed with a SpectraPhysics liquid chromatograph system (pump, SP8800; detector, SP8490) equipped with either a μBondaPak reverse-phase C18 preparative (19 mm × 15 cm; Millipore, Bedford, MA) or a μBondaPak normal phase CN (39 mm × 30 cm; Millipore) column. The C18 column was eluted at room temperature with 100% acetonitrile for 10 min, followed by a linear gradient from 100% acetonitrile to 100% 2-propanol in 45 min at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The CN column was eluted at room temperature in an isocratic system of 100% hexane at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Both columns were monitored at 206 nm. Data were recorded, and chromatograms were integrated by Ramona software (Raytest; Pittsburgh, PA). For applications to the C18 column, standards and samples in CHCl3 containing 5 mg of total cholesterol were dried under N2, redissolved in 0.25 ml of 1:1 (v/v) 2-propanol/acetonitrile. For the CN column, 0.100 mg of sample were dissolved in 0.25 ml hexane. Fractions of interest were collected, dried under N2, redissolved in CHCl3, and stored under N2 at −20 °C until further use. Masses of cholesterol and cholesteryl ester were determined on intact ox-LDL, ox-LDL extract, and aliquots of the oxidized and native cholesteryl ester peaks by the method of Zak et al. (16Zak B.

Chem. 1952; 195: 357-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids in the HPLC fractions were identified by thin layer chromatography with either an 80:20:1 or 30:70:1 hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (v/v/v) solvent system. Cholesteryl oleate, unoxidized and oxidized cholesteryl linoleate, triolein, free cholesterol, diolein, monolein, and oleic acid (Sigma) were used as standards. The chemical structures of the oxidized cholesteryl esters isolated by HPLC were confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy (data not shown). Primary cultures of bovine aortic EC and human foreskin fibroblasts were isolated and maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco-Vogt modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 (DME/F-12) as described previously (18DiCorleto P.E. de la Motte C. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). EC (passages 7–16) were plated in flasks at a split ratio of 1:3 to 1:5 in DME/F-12 containing 5% fetal bovine serum. For the collection of conditioned media containing PDGF, confluent cells were incubated for three days in DME/F-12 containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Amresco, Solon, OH). Fibroblasts (passages 6–18) for the PDGF radioreceptor assay and mitogenic assay (see below) were plated at subconfluent density (1.5–3 × 104cells/cm2) in 24-well plates in 0.5 ml of medium containing 1% Zeta Sera-D (equivalent to CPSR-II, Sigma); cells were used within 2–10 days of plating. Mink lung epithelial cells (ATCC CCL64) for the TGF-β1 growth inhibition assay (see below) were cultured as described previously (19Howe P.H. Draetta G. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Emulsions were prepared from the oxidized LDL extract, the unoxidized and oxidized cholesteryl esters, and the HPLC fractions always on the day of use. Up to 1 mg of sample, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC; Sigma) at 5% of the mass of the sample, and cardiolipin (CL; Sigma) at 1% of the mass of the sample were dried together under N2. Stable emulsions were formed by the addition of 0.020–0.200 ml (depending on the mass of lipid) of acetone/ethanol (1:1, v/v), which instantaneously generated a stable emulsion. DMPC/CL liposomes (5:1, w/w) were used as controls in all experiments involving emulsions. The water-soluble hydroperoxides, cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and hydrogen peroxide (Sigma), were added directly to the media containing PDGF. Either conditioned media containing bovine PDGF, or human recombinant PDGF-AB (Boehringer Mannheim) in DME/F-12 containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Amresco, Solon, OH), was used in the incubations. Lipid emulsions and/or water-soluble hydroperoxides were incubated with PDGF in siliconized polypropylene microfuge tubes for up to 72 h, rotating, at 37 °C. After 72 h, 25 μm HEPES (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to preserve pH during the PDGF radioreceptor assay. PDGF was quantitated by a radioreceptor assay as described previously (2DiCorleto P.E. Bowen-Pope D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1919-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 8Fox P.L. DiCorleto P.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 121: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, unlabeled purified human recombinant PDGF-AB standard aliquots (0.05–0.40 ng/well) and aliquots of the incubations were applied in triplicate or quadruplicate to cultured fibroblasts for 1 h to allow binding of PDGF to PDGF receptors on the cells. The cells were washed, and media containing 125I-PDGF-AB (20Bowen-Pope D.F. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5161-5171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was placed on the cells for another hour to allow binding of 125I-PDGF-AB to any remaining receptor sites. Cells were washed again, solubilized, and radioactivity bound to cells was measured. Competition for binding of the PDGF in conditioned media versus 125I-PDGF-AB was compared with that of the purified standards; mass of active PDGF in conditioned media was expressed as ng/ml. PDGF, EGF (Collaborative Research, Inc.; Bedford, MA), bFGF (Austral Biological; San Ramon, CA) and TGF-β1 (Austral Biological) were incubated for 72 h in the absence and presence of oxidized lipid emulsions as described above. Mitogenic activity of PDGF, EGF, and bFGF was determined by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material by quiescent fibroblasts, 18–22 h following treatment with the mitogen (3Shimokado K. Raines E.W. Madtes D.K. Barrett T.B. Benditt E.P. Ross R. Cell. 1985; 43: 277-286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Growth inhibition by TGF-β1 was evaluated by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material in mink lung epithelial cells (CCL64) as described previously (19Howe P.H. Draetta G. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human recombinant PDGF-AB and a trace of125I-PDGF-AB (18DiCorleto P.E. de la Motte C. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were incubated for 72 h in the absence and presence of oxidized lipid emulsions as described above. Samples and prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were subjected under nonreducing and reducing conditions to 15% SDS-PAGE analysis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar); after autoradiography, gel lanes were sectioned into 0.5 cm pieces and analyzed for radioactivity. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that intact ox-LDL inhibited the production of active PDGF from bovine aortic EC. We decided to test the effect of ox-LDL and the lipid extract of ox-LDL on PDGF activity in the absence and presence of bovine aortic EC (Fig.1). The lipid extract of ox-LDL inactivated PDGF in a dose-dependent manner to the same degree as intact ox-LDL (Fig. 1 A) and inactivated PDGF in both the presence and absence of cells (Fig. 1, B andC). The lipid extract of native LDL had no effect on PDGF activity in either the presence or absence of cells (data not shown). To determine which component(s) of the ox-LDL extract was (were) responsible for the inactivation of PDGF, the lipids of n-LDL and ox-LDL were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig.2). Although several differences between the two chromatograms were apparent, the peak from the ox-LDL extract eluting at approximately 25 min (fraction 5) was notable because of its virtual absence in the lipid profile of n-LDL extract (Fig. 2). Fractions corresponding to the peaks numbered in Fig. 2 Bwere collected and identified by thin layer chromatography (data not shown). Fractions 5 and 9 were shown to be cholesteryl esters. Saponification or cholesteryl esterase treatment of these two fractions produced free cholesterol and fatty acid as determined by both thin layer chromatography and HPLC, further supporting the identification of cholesteryl esters. TBARS analysis determined that fraction 5 was oxidized, but fraction 9 was not (data not shown). The effect of all of the HPLC fractions of the ox-LDL extract on PDGF activity after a 72-h incubation is shown in Fig. 3. Although some of the lipid fractions inactivated PDGF to a small extent, only fraction 5 (oxidized cholesteryl ester) completely inactivated PDGF. Unoxidized cholesteryl ester (fraction 9) had no effect on PDGF activity. Fraction 5 was applied to a normal phase CN HPLC column for further purification. The fraction resolved into three distinct peaks (Fig. 4). Several doses of ox-LDL lipid extract, the C18 peak (fraction 5; Fig. 2 B), and the three peaks from the CN column (peaks 1, 2, and 3 from Fig. 4) were incubated with PDGF to determine the relative PDGF-inactivating potency at each stage of purification. PDGF was inactivated in a dose-dependent manner at all stages of purification (Fig.5). It is apparent from Fig. 5 that the dose response curves for the C18 versus the CN 1, CN 2, and CN 3 peaks are not significantly different, and it can therefore be concluded that these four fractions are nearly equally potent at inactivating PDGF. By fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy, the first CN peak was identified as cholesteryl (13-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E)-octadecadienoate, the second as cholesteryl (13-hydroperoxy-9E,11E)-octadecadienoate, and the third as a mixture of cholesteryl (9-hydroperoxy-10E,12Z)-octadecadienoate and cholesteryl (9-hydroperoxy-10E,12E)-octadecadienoate (data not shown). For the remainder of this report, these hydroperoxy derivatives of cholesteryl octadecadienoates will be collectively referred to as cholesteryl HPODE.Figure 3Effect of HPLC fractions from ox-LDL lipid extract on PDGF activity. Emulsions were made from HPLC fractions 1–10 from ox-LDL extract (see Fig. 2 B) and were incubated with PDGF for 72 h. With the exception of fractions 5 and 9, each fraction was divided between two incubation tubes. Fractions 5 and 9 were shown by thin layer chromatography to be oxidized and unoxidized cholesteryl ester, respectively. The mass of cholesteryl ester was determined as described under “Materials and Methods”; 0.200 mg of fractions 5 and 9, in duplicate, were incubated with PDGF. After 72 h, PDGF receptor interaction was determined using the radioreceptor assay; duplicate assays were performed on each (n = 4).

Values are means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When inactivated PDGF was subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig.6; lane 3) under nonreducing conditions, a broad band at approximately 30 kDa was observed. The addition of cholesteryl HPODE emulsion to active PDGF directly before gel application did not affect migration of the protein (lane 4). Radioactivity in gel slices of inactivated PDGF (Fig. 6) yielded a broad peak of slightly higher molecular mass compared with active PDGF. Under reducing conditions, the results were the same: native PDGF appeared as a band of approximately 15 kDa, whereas inactivated PDGF appeared as a diffuse band of slightly higher molecular mass (data not shown). We tested the specificity of the oxidized lipid for inactivating PDGF. Pre-incubating cholesteryl HPODE with PDGF (Fig.7 A) or bFGF (Fig.7 D) blocked the mitogenic activity in human foreskin fibroblasts but had no effect on the mitogenic activity of EGF (Fig.7 B). Pre-incubating the oxidized lipid with TGF-β1 abolished the antiproliferative effect of TGF-β1 in a mink lung epithelial cell assay (Fig. 7 C). To determine whether other cholesteryl esters could inactivate PDGF after oxidation, cholesteryls stearate, oleate, linoleate, linolenate, arachidate, and arachidonate were subjected to oxidizing conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lipid oxidation of cholesteryls stearate, oleate, and arachidate as determined by TBARS was essentially zero; TBARS for cholesteryls linoleate, linolenate, and arachidonate were 2.6, 83.2, and 88.1 nmol malondialdehyde/mg of cholesteryl ester, respectively. Table Ishows that, in the presence of cholesteryl esters that had become oxidized, PDGF was inactivated in a dose-dependent manner and that the extent of inactivation correlated with the degree of lipid peroxidation. PDGF activity was not affected when conditioned media was incubated with cholesteryl esters that had not become oxidized.Table IInactivation of PDGF by oxidized cholesteryl estersCholesteryl esterTBARSConcentrationPDGFnmol MDA/mg cholesterol estermg cholesterol esterng/mlControl1.42 (0.19)Stearate (18:0)00.2001.34 (0.19)Oleate (18:1)00.2001.51 (0.12)Linoleate (18:2)2.560.0250.38 (0.20)0.1000.28 (0.26)0.2000Linolenate (18:3)83.20.0011.04 (0.18)0.00500.0250Arachidate (20:0)00.2001.37 (0.07)Arachidonate (20:4)88.10.0010.78 (0.35)0.00500.0250Cholesteryl esters were subjected to oxidizing conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” PDGF in DME/F-12 plus 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was incubated for 72 h with cholesteryl ester emulsions at the concentrations indicated.

PDGF was quantitated by the radioreceptor assay as described. Values are means ± S.E. (n = 4). We also examined whether nonlipid hydroperoxides could inactivate PDGF. Even though cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and hydrogen peroxide were incubated with PDGF for 72 h, these nonlipid hydroperoxides did not inactivate PDGF (TableII) even at concentrations greatly exceeding that required of cholesteryl HPODE (0.01–0.03 mm) to inactivate PDGF. When a noninactivating cholesteryl ester emulsion (cholesteryl oleate; experiment B in Table II) was added to the incubations, thereby providing a lipid surface for the nonlipid hydroperoxides, no effect on PDGF activity was observed. It therefore can be concluded that nonlipid hydroperoxides do not affect PDGF activity.Table IIThe effect of nonlipid hydroperoxides on PDGF activityExperimentControlCumeme hydroperoxidet-butyl hydroperoxideHydrogen peroxideA3.15 (0.30)2.76 (0.28)2.74 (0.72)3.37 (0.37)B1.24 (0.04)1.34 (0.06)1.17 (0.11)NTPDGF (ng/ml by radioreceptor assay) in DME/F-12 plus 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was incubated for 72 h with nonlipid hydroperoxides in the absence (experiment A) or presence (experiment B) of a noninactivating cholesteryl ester, cholesteryl oleate.

Chem. 1987; 262: 6046-6054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that the lipid moiety of ox-LDL causes inactivation of PDGF in a cell-free system. The inactivating molecules of ox-LDL have been identified as the 9- and 13-hydroperoxy derivatives of cholesteryl linoleate. Additional experiments demonstrated that these cholesteryl hydroperoxides were also capable of inactivating TGF-β1 and bFGF, but not EGF. The mechanism by which cholesteryl HPODE inactivates PDGF and why the oxidized lipid inactivates PDGF, bFGF, and TGF-β1, but not EGF, are not yet known. Inactivated PDGF, whether nonreduced or reduced, has a slightly higher molecular weight than active PDGF, which would suggest a lack of aggregation of the PDGF molecules, and more likely a covalent attachment of the oxidized lipid to PDGF. Such a modification might cause global conformational changes to the growth factor or an obstruction such that PDGF no longer binds to its receptors. Free HPODE has been reported previously to modify an essential methionine in 15-lipoxygenase and alter enzymatic activity (22Gan Q.F. Witkop G.L. Sloane D.L. Straub K.M. Sigal E. Biochem. 1995; 34: 7069-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), thus setting precedence for HPODE-mediated protein alteration. The biochemistry and pathology of protein oxidation have been recently reviewed (23Dean R.T. Fo S. Stocker R. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Inactivation of FGF, presumably via oxidative processes, has been reported by Engleka and Maciag (24Engleka K.A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who demonstrated that acidic FGF, but not bFGF, was inactivated by copper-catalyzed oxidation and that the inactivation involved the formation of dimers from monomeric acidic FGF. Grant et al. (25Grant M.M. Koo H. Rosenfeld W. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L370-L375PubMed Google Scholar) have recently shown that the growth of human endothelial cells was inhibited by increasing levels of O2 exposure and that this inhibition was mediated through the inactivation of acidic FGF, bFGF, and endothelial cell growth factor by O2 exposure. That the inactivating molecules of ox-LDL were identified as isomers of cholesteryl HPODE is of physiological significance: cholesteryl linoleate comprises 50% of the total cholesteryl esters in normal human LDL (26Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. Spector A.A. Biochemistry and Biology of Plasma Lipoproteins. 11. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1986: 495-504Google Scholar), suggesting that the potential for a significant concentration of these oxidized cholesteryl esters may exist under pathological conditions. Although cholesteryl linolenate and cholesteryl arachidonate comprise less than 10% of the total cholesteryl esters in normal human plasma, our studies show that they are highly oxidizable and very potent inactivators of PDGF. Oxidized derivatives of cholesteryl esters, particularly cholesteryl linoleate, have been found in both human plasma (27Yamamoto Y. Niki E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and human atheromas (28Harland W.A. Gilbert J.D. Steel G. Brooks J.W.

Aortic quantities of cholesteryl linoleate and its oxidation products have been shown to increase with the progression of vascular disease (28Harland W.A. Gilbert J.D. Steel G. Brooks J.W.

Our data suggest that it is possible that these molecules could inactivate certain growth factors under physiological conditions. In this regard, Shen et al. (36Shen J. Herderick E. Cornhill J.F.

The results presented here, if operative in vivo, may participate in this protective process. It will be important to determine whether oxidized lipids can inactivate PDGF, as well as other growth factors and proteins in vivo, and what the impact of the inactivation is on the processes of aortic lesion development, inflammation, and wound healing.

We isolated six mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaecontaining mutations in the 20 S proteasome β-type subunitPre3. Three mutations (pre3–2, pre3–3, andpre3–5) which reside at the active site cleft of the Pre3 subunit solely caused reduction of the proteasomal peptidylglutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing activity but did not lead to detectable defects in protein degradation nor to any other phenotype. However, thepre3–2 mutation strengthened phenotypes induced by other 20 S proteasomal mutations, indicating that the peptidylglutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing activity has to fulfill some rescue functions. The other three mutations (pre3–1, pre3–4, andpre3–6) are located at diverse sites of the Pre3 protein and caused multiple defects in proteasomal peptide cleaving activities.pre3–1 and pre3–6 mutants exhibited significant defects in proteasomal protein degradation; they accumulated ubiquitinated proteins and stabilized defined substrate proteins as, e.g. fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. In addition,pre3–1 and pre3–6 mutant cells exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes as temperature sensitivity and cell cycle-related effects."

In vitro, all of the JAK kinases can phosphorylate IFNaR1, predominantly on tyrosine 466 (Tyr-466) (13Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K.

Homodimerization of a chimeric protein composed of the CD4 extracellular domain fused to the IFNaR1 intracellular domain resulted in its tyrosine phosphorylation. This phosphorylation was, again, found to occur primarily on Tyr-466 and to be dependent on the association of IFNaR1 with Tyk2 (17Krishnan K. Yan H. Lim J.T.E. Krolewski J.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 125-133Google Scholar). The pattern of phosphorylation of IFNaR1 under physiologic conditions, though, has not been determined. The STAT proteins are a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors employed in signaling pathways activated by various cytokines and growth factors (for a review, see Ref. 18Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar). STAT proteins share a common domain structure; each has a DNA-binding domain, a transactivation domain, a Src-homology 3 domain, a Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain for binding phosphotyrosine, and a single tyrosine phosphorylation site near the C terminus. Complementation of mutant cell lines nonresponsive to IFNα revealed that two STAT family members, Stat1 and Stat2, are involved in the IFNα signal transduction pathway (19Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Müller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). After IFNα stimulation, Stat2 docks to IFNaR1 via an interaction between the Stat2 SH2 domain and the phosphorylated Tyr-466 (Tyr(P)-466) of IFNaR1 (16Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 125-133Google Scholar). The critical role of Tyr(P)-466 and the Stat2 SH2 domain in this docking interaction has been demonstrated by in vitro binding studies (16Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphopeptides corresponding to the region surrounding Tyr-466 and dominant-negative IFNaR1 constructs in which Tyr-466 has been mutated to phenylalanine inhibit Stat2 phosphorylation in vivo (16Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine dependent recruitment by IFNaR1 positions Stat2 to become tyrosine phosphorylated, presumably by one of the associated JAK kinases. Phosphorylated Stat2, in turn, provides a docking site for the SH2 domain of Stat1, positioning it for tyrosine phosphorylation (16Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D.

The two STAT molecules heterodimerize via SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions, translocate to the nucleus, and effect transcription of genes under control ofinterferon-stimulated gene responseelements (ISREs) (21Gupta S.

SH2 domains were first identified as conserved noncatalytic domains in the Src and Fps proteins (24Sadowski I. Stone J.C. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4396-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). These domains were subsequently found in many proteins and shown to mediate interactions between cytoplasmic proteins by binding to phosphorylated tyrosine (25Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutations in the residues surrounding tyrosines that function as SH2 domain-docking sites (summarized in Ref. 26Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar) and subsequent studies that identified ligands for recombinant SH2 domains from degenerate phosphopeptide libraries indicated that the residue immediately C-terminal and the residue three amino acids C-terminal to the phosphorylated tyrosine (the +1 and +3 positions with respect to the tyrosine), were of critical importance in binding and conference of specificity for many SH2 domains (27Songyang Z.

In this report, we examine the role of the residues C-terminal to Tyr-466 of IFNaR1 in the docking of Stat2 and subsequent signaling events and demonstrate that the amino acids at positions +1 and +5 relative to Tyr-466 are particularly critical for these molecular events. All of the constructs were expressed from the vector pMT2T (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs encoding the wild type full-length IFNaR1, the Y466F mutant of full-length IFNaR1, and the wild type CD4-IFNaR1 chimera have been previously described (16Yan H. Krishnan K.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 125-133Google Scholar). A series of five mutant constructs, which convert residues 467 through 471 to alanine were generated by a single step polymerase chain reaction approach, using a 5′ primer containing the appropriate mutation and a wild type 3′ primer. Mutant polymerase chain reaction products spanning positions 1462–1617 of the IFNaR1 cDNA (5Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) were first cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced to ensure fidelity. NsiI-MfeI restriction fragments, containing the various mutations, were transferred into versions of the receptors cloned in Bluescript (Stratagene). Subsequently,PstI or EcoRI fragments containing the entire mutant full-length or chimeric receptor, respectively, were transferred into the pMT2T expression vector. The β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pCH110) used to control for transfection efficiency, and the ISRE-luciferase reporter plasmid (pZ-ISRE-luc; from R. Pine, Public Health Research Institute, New York, NY), which contains four tandem copies of the ISRE, have been previously described (30Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M.

The human embryonic kidney 293T cell line and the human osteogenic sarcoma U2OS cell line were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA). Transfections were performed using calcium phosphate as described previously (16Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody used for cross-linking (Leu3a) was obtained from Becton-Dickinson Immunochemistry. Rabbit polyclonal anti-CD4 antisera used for immunoblotting (32Deen K.C. McDougal J.S. Inacker R. Folena-Wasserman G. Arthos J. Rosenberg J. Maddon P.J. Axel R. Sweet R.W. Nature ( Lond. ). 1988; 331: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) was from R.W. Sweet (Smith Kline-Beecham Pharmaceuticals). The rabbit polyclonal anti-Stat2 antisera, used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (22Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V.R. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), was from C. Schindler (Columbia University, New York, NY). The anti-Stat2 monoclonal antibody used in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The polyclonal anti-Tyk2 antisera used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting has been previously described (8Platanias L.C. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24053-24057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10, was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Preparation of lysates, immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (16Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D.

Transfected cells (105) were stained with isotype-matched phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD4 and anti-IgG2a murine monoclonal antibodies (Caltag, S. San Francisco, CA) and analyzed as described (14Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For each individual assay, duplicate subconfluent 10-cm dishes of U2OS cells were transfected with 5 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid, 5 μg of the ISRE-luciferase plasmid, and 10 μg of the expression vector. 30 h after transfection, one dish was treated with 3000 units/ml of IFNα2 (from M. Brunda; Hoffman-La Roche, Nutley, NJ) for 18 h at 37 °C, and the other dish was left untreated. Cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and rapidly frozen on dry ice. Lysates were thawed, and cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Luciferase activity was measured as per the manufacturer's protocol (Promega) and β-galactosidase activity was measured as described (30Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Data from the luciferase assays was analyzed using an unpaired t test to compare wild type transfectants with each of the mutants. To study the contribution of various amino acid residues in the SH2-mediated docking of Stat2 to the IFNaR1 receptor, we took advantage of a chimeric receptor system that reconstitutes the initial events in IFNα signaling, including kinase activation, receptor phosphorylation, and STAT docking (17Krishnan K. Yan H. Lim J.T.E. Krolewski J.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 125-133Google Scholar). More distal events, such as Stat2 tyrosine phosphorylation, are not observed in this chimeric system, presumably because additional receptor subunit(s) (33Pestka S. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: S918-S940Google Scholar) are required. Cells transfected with chimeric molecules composed of the CD4 extracellular domain fused to the intracellular domain of IFNaR1 (CD4-IFNaR1) are tyrosine phosphorylated, predominantly at Tyr-466 of IFNaR1, following cross-linking with an anti-CD4 antibody (17Krishnan K. Yan H. Lim J.T.E. Krolewski J.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 125-133Google Scholar). Stat2 is recruited to the phosphorylated chimera, as evidenced by the co-immunoprecipitation of the chimeric receptor by anti-Stat2 antibodies (17Krishnan K. Yan H. Lim J.T.E. Krolewski J.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 125-133Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation was demonstrated to be specific for Stat2 and dependent on the phosphorylation of Tyr-466. In agreement with the in vitro and in vivo data cited above (16Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), this association supports the idea that Stat2 is recruited to phosphorylated Tyr-466 on IFNaR1. Furthermore, because more distal signaling events do not occur in the chimeric system, the Stat2-IFNaR1 association is unusually stable and can be much more readily detected than the equivalent interaction occurring under physiologic conditions. We therefore reasoned that any mutation altering a site required for SH2-receptor interaction will inhibit the co-immunoprecipitation of Stat2 and the CD4-IFNaR1 chimera. Five mutant CD4-IFNaR1 chimeric molecules were constructed, substituting alanine for each of the five amino acids immediately C-terminal to Tyr-466 (amino acids 467 through 471, corresponding to the sequence VFFPS). To ensure that the mutations do not effect induced tyrosine phosphorylation, we first performed cross-linking experiments with the mutants and measured chimeric receptor phosphorylation. As the top panel of Fig.1 shows, anti-CD4 treatment of 293T cells transfected with either the wild type chimera or any of the five mutant constructs results in a strong induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the chimeric receptor. Stripping the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot and reprobing with a polyclonal anti-CD4 antibody (Fig. 1, bottom panel) showed that each of the chimeric constructs was expressed, indicating that these single amino acid substitutions do not dramatically alter protein stability. In addition, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with an anti-CD4 antibody showed that the each of the various chimeric receptors was expressed on the cell surface in approximately equivalent levels (data not shown). It is important to note that, although we have observed differences in the level of expression of the various chimeric constructs, the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation is similar in all cases. IFNaR1-Stat2 docking is completely dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the chimeric receptor. Thus, this is the most relevant control criteria for comparing the constructs in the recruitment assay described below. Having demonstrated that mutation of residues adjacent to Tyr-466 does not effect IFNaR1 phosphorylation, we sought to determine which, if any, of these residues influence the association of the Stat2 SH2 domain with the phosphotyrosine on IFNaR1. To test this, wild type and mutant CD4-IFNaR1 chimeras were transfected into 293T cells and cross-linked. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Stat2 monoclonal antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-CD4 antisera. As shown in Fig. 2, co-immunoprecipitation and therefore association of CD4-IFNaR1 with Stat2 was detected at similar levels in cells transfected with the wild type construct (lane 1), as well as constructs expressing the mutants F468A (lane 5), F469A (lane 7), and P470A (lane 9). On the other hand, receptors encoding two mutant constructs, V467A (lane 3) and S471A (lane 11), were co-immunoprecipitated significantly less efficiently than the wild type. Thus, three residues (+2, +3, and +4 with respect to Tyr-466) have little effect on the binding of the Stat2 SH2 domain to IFNaR1, whereas two others (+1 and +5) appear to be important for this association. To demonstrate the importance of the +1 and +5 residues in a more physiologic setting, we employed an IFNα-driven reporter gene system. As noted in the Introduction, docking of Stat2 to the phosphorylated IFNaR1 is believed to position Stat2 so that it may be tyrosine phosphorylated by one of the JAK kinases. Phosphorylated STAT molecules dimerize, translocate to the nucleus and stimulate transcription of genes located downstream of an ISRE. Overexpression of a mutant receptor proficient in IFNα binding but deficient in Stat2 docking, we reasoned, would have a dominant inhibitory effect on IFNα signaling. Adenovirus-transformed 293T cells cannot be employed in reporter gene assays because the E1A gene product binds p300/cAMP response element-binding protein and prevents Stat2-mediated transactivation (34Bhattacharya S. Eckner R. Grossman S. Oldread E. Arany Z. D'Andrea A. Livingston D.M. Nature ( Lond. ). 1996; 383: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Therefore, we transfected U2OS cells with a plasmid containing the firefly luciferase gene downstream of a minimal promoter; upstream of this gene are four tandem-arranged ISRE enhancer elements. Constructs overexpressing either wild type or mutant forms of the full-length IFNaR1 receptor protein, as well as a lacZexpressing construct to control for transfection efficiency, were co-transfected with this reporter gene construct. The extent of dominant negative inhibition is quantified by measuring activity of the reporter gene in the presence and absence of IFNα. In cells transfected with either wild type IFNaR1 (Fig.3, first bar from theleft) or an empty vector (data not shown), IFNα treatment produces an approximately 10-fold increase in luciferase activity. Overexpression of IFNaR1-Y466F, which cannot be phosphorylated at the Stat2 docking site, inhibits IFNα-induced luciferase activity 70% (Fig. 3, seventh bar). In cells transfected with the construct containing IFNaR1 mutated at the +3 site with respect to the tyrosine (F469A), an increase in luciferase activity similar to that seen in cells transfected with the wild type is observed following treatment (Fig. 3, fourth bar). In contrast, constructs mutated at either the +1 (V467A, second bar) or +5 (S471A,sixth bar) positions produced an unequivocal dominant negative effect on induced luciferase activity, though less pronounced than the Y466F mutant construct. Finally, mutations at the +2 and +4 positions (F468A and P470A, respectively), which did not appreciably effect the ability of Stat2 to co-immunoprecipitate the receptor (Fig.2), produced intermediate effects on reporter gene activity when overexpressed in U2OS cells. To determine if the dominant inhibitory effect of either the +2 or +4 mutant is significant, an unpaired t test was used to compare the induction of reporter gene activity observed in cells transfected with wild type IFNaR1 and the induction observed in cells transfected with each of the mutants. As expected from inspection of Fig. 3, a significant difference in induced luciferase activity was observed between the wild type and cells overexpressing either the +1 or +5 mutants (p < 0.0005), whereas the induction of reporter gene activity in cells overexpressing the +3 mutant was not different from the wild type (p > 0.05). Interestingly, the induction of luciferase activity in cells overexpressing the +4 mutant was found to be significantly different from that in wild type IFNaR1 transfected cells (p < 0.005), indicating some inhibitory effect of this mutation. Statistical analysis of the data for the +2 mutant indicates no difference from wild type (p > 0.05). Thus, the reporter gene assay and the co-immunoprecipitation data both suggest that residues at the +1 and +5 positions are critically involved in the interaction between the Tyr-466 docking site and the Stat2 SH2 domain. Mutation at the +4 position may have a smaller effect on signaling that is not revealed in the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Finally, to elucidate the molecular nature of the inhibition observed in cells overexpressing IFNaR1 mutants, we examined the phosphorylation state of signaling cascade components following IFNα treatment. Wild type and mutant IFNaR1 constructs were overexpressed in 293T cells. These cells were used because they are IFNα responsive and can be transfected at the very high levels required to permit the proteins produced by the transfected genes to displace endogenous molecules involved in signaling interactions (17Krishnan K. Yan H. Lim J.T.E. Krolewski J.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 125-133Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling components was assayed by immunoblotting anti-Tyk2 and anti-Stat2 immunoprecipitates with an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10). In cells transfected with either wild type IFNaR1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) or any of the five IFNaR1 constructs mutated near Tyr-466 (Fig.4 A, lanes 3, 5, 7,9, and 11), IFNα treatment induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2. On the other hand, when Stat2 phosphorylation was assayed, differences were observed between the various mutants. Stat2 phosphorylation in cells transfected with the mutants F468A, F469A, and P470A (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5, 7, and 9, respectively) occurs at levels similar to that of wild type IFNaR1 (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). On the other hand, cells transfected with mutants V467A and S471A (Fig.4 B, lanes 3 and 11, respectively) showed a decreased induction of Stat2 tyrosine phosphorylation, relative to the wild type. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the Stat1 protein, which co-immunoprecipitates with Stat2, is also diminished. As shown previously (16Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), overexpression of the Y466F mutant of IFNaR1 has a stronger effect on IFNα induced Stat2 and Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). Thus, consistent with the idea that SH2-dependent docking on IFNaR1 positions Stat2 for tyrosine phosphorylation, mutations at the +1 and +5 positions show a dominant inhibitory effect on Stat2 activation, independent of Tyk2 activation. Furthermore, as in Fig. 3, IFNaR1 constructs containing mutations in the carboxyl-terminal flanking amino acids produce a more modest dominant negative effect compared with that observed with a construct in which the critical tyrosine has been mutated to phenylalanine. We have previously demonstrated that following IFNα treatment, Stat2 is specifically recruited to Tyr(P)-466 on the IFNaR1 subunit of the receptor (16Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S.

The biologic actions of GM-CSF are mediated by its binding to the α and β subunits of the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFRα and βc, respectively). To determine whether identical regions of the βc protein mediate both cell growth and differentiation, we expressed cDNA constructs encoding the human wild-type (897 amino acids) and truncated βc (hβc) subunits along with the wild-type human GM-CSFRα subunit in the murine WT19 cell line, an FDC-P1-derived cell line that differentiates toward the monocytic lineage in response to murine GM-CSF. Whereas the WT19 cell line carrying the C-terminal deleted hβc subunit of 627 amino acids was still able to grow in human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF), 681 amino acids of the hβc were necessary for cell differentiation. The addition of hGM-CSF to WT19 cell lines containing the hβc627 subunit stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and induced the tyrosine-phosphorylation of SHP-2 and STAT5, suggesting that the activation of these molecules is insufficient to mediate the induction of differentiation. A point mutation of tyrosine 628 to phenylalanine (Y628F) within hβc681 abolished the ability of hGM-CSF to induce differentiation.

GM-CSF also enhances the function of mature neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils, and stimulates the burst-promoting activity for BFU-E (1Baldwin G.C. Dev.

Blood. 1989; 74: 49-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in murine models, alveolar proteinosis, a disease caused by excessive secretion of protein into the alveolar spaces, is associated with the deletion of the GM-CSF gene, suggesting that GM-CSF is essential for alveolar macrophage functions (4Dranoff G. Crawford A.D. Sadelain M. Ream B. Rashid A. Bronson R.T. Dickersin G.R. Bachurski C.J. Mark E.L.

Dunn A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5592-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar).The biologic actions of GM-CSF are mediated by its binding to a specific receptor consisting of α and β subunits, both of which are members of the type I cytokine receptor family (6Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 7Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The α subunit (GM-CSFRα) binds GM-CSF with low affinity (6Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The β subunit does not bind GM-CSF itself, but it forms a high affinity receptor in combination with the α subunit (7Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The β chain is referred to as the common β chain (βc) because it is also utilized by interleukin 3 (IL-3) and interleukin 5 (IL-5) (8Kitamura T. Sato N. Arai K. Miyajima A. Cell. 1991; 66: 1165-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 9Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar).We have recently reported that the cytoplasmic domain of the human GM-CSFRα (hGM-CSFRα) is indispensable for cellular differentiation induced by human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF) (10Matsuguchi T. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17450-17459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of the human βc (hβc) has recently been demonstrated to be essential for hGM-CSF-mediated myeloid cell differentiation (11Smith A. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of differentiation by GM-CSF has not been clearly elucidated. In the present study, we examined the role of βc in GM-CSF-mediated cell differentiation by using the murine WT19 cell line, an FDC-P1-derived cell line that uniformly differentiates toward the monocytic lineage in response to murine GM-CSF (mGM-CSF), but grows without differentiation in the presence of murine IL-3 (mIL-3) (10Matsuguchi T. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17450-17459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,12Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar). By expressing the wild-type and mutated hβc constructs along with the wild-type hGM-CSFRα in WT19 cells, we demonstrate the following results. 1) Mutation of the two prolines in the box 1 region of hβc, which are necessary for Jak2 activation, results in the loss of hGM-CSF-induced cell differentiation. 2) The hβc C-terminal truncation mutants demonstrate that 681 amino acids of the hβc are sufficient to mediate hGM-CSF-induced differentiation, but the truncation of the hβc subunit to amino acid 627 abolishes this differentiation response. In contrast, 559 amino acids of the hβc are sufficient for hGM-CSF-induced cell growth. 3) Within the hβc681 subunit, a point mutation of tyrosine 628 to phenylalanine abolishes the ability of hβc681 to induce differentiation. 4) The activation of either ERK or STAT5 by hGM-CSF does not correlate with the ability of hGM-CSF to induce myeloid cell differentiation. These results demonstrate that hGM-CSF-mediated cell growth and differentiation require distinct regions of the hβc cytoplasmic domain.DISCUSSIONBy expressing truncated forms of hβc in WT19 cells, we demonstrated that hGM-CSF-induced morphological differentiation and the surface expression of F4/80 requires hβc subunits of 832, 796, or 681 amino acids in length (Fig. 3, Table I). In contrast, WT19 cells expressing hβc subunit containing 627 amino acids or less did not differentiate but were capable of growth in the presence of hGM-CSF (Fig. 3). Mutation of the two prolines in the box 1 region blocked both growth and differentiation. Thus, these results suggest that cell growth and differentiation are mediated by different regions of the receptor and that the signals generated by the box 1 region of the receptor are necessary for both cellular events.Similar results to those described above have been generated using M1 and WEHI-3B D+ cells as a target cell population for transfection (11Smith A. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, wild-type hβc and hβc783, but not hβc541 or 461, could mediate hGM-CSF-induced morphological change and differentiation marker induction, whereas induction of cell differentiation by hβc626 required a 50- to 100-fold higher concentration of hGM-CSF (M1 cells). However, in the WT19 cell system, neither hβc627 nor hβc681Y628F could induce cell differentiation even at a very high concentration (1 μg/ml) of hGM-CSF (data not shown). The results derived from M1 cells suggest that the region between amino acids 627 and 783 is necessary for the full differentiation signal, whereas our results more narrowly delineate the crucial region for differentiation to lie between 628 and 681.The results described here demonstrate that tyrosine 628 is highly phosphorylated after hGM-CSF treatment in vivo (Fig. 4). In the hβc681 construct, this phosphotyrosine is essential for differentiation. Tyr-627 and its surrounding amino acids are conserved between human and mouse βc (SLEYLCL), suggesting that in both species this tyrosine may play an important role in differentiation. In the macrophage colony stimulating factor signaling, both Tyr-807 and Tyr-721 of macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor were shown to be necessary for monocytic differentiation and for the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) (12Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The involvement of PLCγ in M-CSF-mediated cell differentiation was further demonstrated by the inhibition of differentiation using U-73122, a compound that acts as a specific inhibitor of PLCγ (22Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The surrounding amino acid sequence of hβc Tyr-628 (YLCL) is homologous to the optimal binding site for the N-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ in a phosphopeptide binding assay (32Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Brige R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). However, PLCγ may not be involved in GM-CSF-induced differentiation as suggested by the following data. First, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ was not induced by addition of hGM-CSF to WT19 cells (data not shown) or another myeloid cell line treated with this hormone (33Hallek M. Ando K. Eder M. Slattery K. Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F. Griffin J.D. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1994; 8: 740-748PubMed Google Scholar), although M-CSF induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ. Second, U-73122 did not inhibit the differentiation of WT19 cells by mGM-CSF at 1 μm, a concentration 10 times higher than that capable of inhibiting the M-CSF-mediated differentiation (22Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (data not shown).Although the single tyrosine mutation in the 681 hβc containing cell line had significant biologic effects, this mutation had no significant effect on differentiation in the wild-type receptor. The wild-type hβc contains four tyrosines C-terminal to Tyr-628. One of them (Tyr-882) has a similar amino acid sequence (YLSL) to Tyr-628 (YLCL). Two of them (Tyr-766 and Tyr-842) have a leucine at the +3 amino acid (YVEL and YCFL, respectively). The amino acid at +3 position of the tyrosine is important in dictating the binding affinity for many SH2 domain-containing proteins (32Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Brige R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). It is possible that a common signaling molecule binds to a number of tyrosines in the hβc-mediating cell differentiation so that, in the wild-type receptor, mutation of a single tyrosine is not sufficient to abolish cell differentiation.The role of ERKs in differentiation appears to be complex and may depend on the cell type and the stimulus involved. The ERK pathway has been suggested to be essential for the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells (27Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar, 34Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Also, interleukin 6 (IL-6) can induce PC12 differentiation when the cells are pretreated with nerve growth factor (35Ihara S. Iwamatsu A. Fujiyoshi T. Komi A. Yamori T. Fukui Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A mutation of a specific tyrosine in gp130, the IL-6 receptor signaling subunit involved in ERK activation, abolishes the induction of cell differentiation by IL-6 (23Ihara S. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Nagata S. Hirano T. Fukui Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5345-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the ERK pathway may not be involved in hGM-CSF-mediated differentiation of WT19 cells. 1) Although Tyr-628 of hβc was shown to be a binding site for SHP-2 SH2 domains (36Bone H. Dechert U. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), it was not necessary for hGM-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 or ERK activation (Fig. 6) (36Bone H. Dechert U. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 2) PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK, blocked activation, but this compound had no significant effect on differentiation. 3) The expression of a constitutively active mutant of MEK in WT19 cells did not induce differentiation. 2T. Matsuguchi and A.Kraft, unpublished data. Thus, activation of ERK does not appear to be sufficient or necessary for hGM-CSF-induced differentiation of WT19 cells.Activation of Stat proteins by several cytokines has been suggested to be involved in cell differentiation (37Shimozaki K.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In WT19 cells transfected with hGM-CSFRα and wild-type hβc, hGM-CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both isoforms of Stat5, but not other Stat proteins (Stat1, Stat3, and Stat6 examined). Tyr-628 was not necessary for the hGM-CSF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of either Stat5a or 5b. In addition, both hβc628 and hβc681Y628F could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a and 5b in response to hGM-CSF equivalent to that seen in WT19 cells containing the wild-type receptor (Fig. 8). These results suggest that Stat5 activation is not sufficient for the induction of cellular differentiation. In a recent report, using chimeric receptors of erythropoietin and IL-3, a delayed activation of Stat5 was suggested to be important for the erythroid differentiation induction of BaF/3 cells (43Pless M. Norga K. Carroll M. Heim M.H. D'Andrea A.D. Mathey-Prevot B. Blood. 1997; 89: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we did not see a delay in the time course of Stat5 activation in WT19 transfectants which differentiate in response to hGM-CSF in contrast to those cell lines which are capable of only growth (data not shown). Thus, none of the signals examined (STAT5 activation along with SHP-2 and Shc phosphorylation) are sufficient to modulate differentiation.In conclusion, our data suggest that cell differentiation and cell growth induced by hGM-CSF are mediated by different regions of the hβc subunit. Attempts are underway to define the novel signals generated by amino acids 627–681 of the hβc which control the differentiated phenotype.

GM-CSF also enhances the function of mature neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils, and stimulates the burst-promoting activity for BFU-E (1Baldwin G.C. Dev.

In addition, in murine models, alveolar proteinosis, a disease caused by excessive secretion of protein into the alveolar spaces, is associated with the deletion of the GM-CSF gene, suggesting that GM-CSF is essential for alveolar macrophage functions (4Dranoff G.

Dunn A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5592-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The biologic actions of GM-CSF are mediated by its binding to a specific receptor consisting of α and β subunits, both of which are members of the type I cytokine receptor family (6Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 7Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The α subunit (GM-CSFRα) binds GM-CSF with low affinity (6Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The β subunit does not bind GM-CSF itself, but it forms a high affinity receptor in combination with the α subunit (7Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The β chain is referred to as the common β chain (βc) because it is also utilized by interleukin 3 (IL-3) and interleukin 5 (IL-5) (8Kitamura T. Sato N. Arai K. Miyajima A.

Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the cytoplasmic domain of the human GM-CSFRα (hGM-CSFRα) is indispensable for cellular differentiation induced by human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF) (10Matsuguchi T. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17450-17459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of the human βc (hβc) has recently been demonstrated to be essential for hGM-CSF-mediated myeloid cell differentiation (11Smith A. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of differentiation by GM-CSF has not been clearly elucidated. In the present study, we examined the role of βc in GM-CSF-mediated cell differentiation by using the murine WT19 cell line, an FDC-P1-derived cell line that uniformly differentiates toward the monocytic lineage in response to murine GM-CSF (mGM-CSF), but grows without differentiation in the presence of murine IL-3 (mIL-3) (10Matsuguchi T.

Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar). By expressing the wild-type and mutated hβc constructs along with the wild-type hGM-CSFRα in WT19 cells, we demonstrate the following results. 1) Mutation of the two prolines in the box 1 region of hβc, which are necessary for Jak2 activation, results in the loss of hGM-CSF-induced cell differentiation. 2) The hβc C-terminal truncation mutants demonstrate that 681 amino acids of the hβc are sufficient to mediate hGM-CSF-induced differentiation, but the truncation of the hβc subunit to amino acid 627 abolishes this differentiation response. In contrast, 559 amino acids of the hβc are sufficient for hGM-CSF-induced cell growth. 3) Within the hβc681 subunit, a point mutation of tyrosine 628 to phenylalanine abolishes the ability of hβc681 to induce differentiation. 4) The activation of either ERK or STAT5 by hGM-CSF does not correlate with the ability of hGM-CSF to induce myeloid cell differentiation. These results demonstrate that hGM-CSF-mediated cell growth and differentiation require distinct regions of the hβc cytoplasmic domain. DISCUSSIONBy expressing truncated forms of hβc in WT19 cells, we demonstrated that hGM-CSF-induced morphological differentiation and the surface expression of F4/80 requires hβc subunits of 832, 796, or 681 amino acids in length (Fig. 3, Table I). In contrast, WT19 cells expressing hβc subunit containing 627 amino acids or less did not differentiate but were capable of growth in the presence of hGM-CSF (Fig. 3). Mutation of the two prolines in the box 1 region blocked both growth and differentiation. Thus, these results suggest that cell growth and differentiation are mediated by different regions of the receptor and that the signals generated by the box 1 region of the receptor are necessary for both cellular events.Similar results to those described above have been generated using M1 and WEHI-3B D+ cells as a target cell population for transfection (11Smith A. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, wild-type hβc and hβc783, but not hβc541 or 461, could mediate hGM-CSF-induced morphological change and differentiation marker induction, whereas induction of cell differentiation by hβc626 required a 50- to 100-fold higher concentration of hGM-CSF (M1 cells). However, in the WT19 cell system, neither hβc627 nor hβc681Y628F could induce cell differentiation even at a very high concentration (1 μg/ml) of hGM-CSF (data not shown). The results derived from M1 cells suggest that the region between amino acids 627 and 783 is necessary for the full differentiation signal, whereas our results more narrowly delineate the crucial region for differentiation to lie between 628 and 681.The results described here demonstrate that tyrosine 628 is highly phosphorylated after hGM-CSF treatment in vivo (Fig. 4). In the hβc681 construct, this phosphotyrosine is essential for differentiation. Tyr-627 and its surrounding amino acids are conserved between human and mouse βc (SLEYLCL), suggesting that in both species this tyrosine may play an important role in differentiation. In the macrophage colony stimulating factor signaling, both Tyr-807 and Tyr-721 of macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor were shown to be necessary for monocytic differentiation and for the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) (12Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The involvement of PLCγ in M-CSF-mediated cell differentiation was further demonstrated by the inhibition of differentiation using U-73122, a compound that acts as a specific inhibitor of PLCγ (22Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The surrounding amino acid sequence of hβc Tyr-628 (YLCL) is homologous to the optimal binding site for the N-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ in a phosphopeptide binding assay (32Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Brige R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

First, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ was not induced by addition of hGM-CSF to WT19 cells (data not shown) or another myeloid cell line treated with this hormone (33Hallek M. Ando K. Eder M. Slattery K. Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F. Griffin J.D. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1994; 8: 740-748PubMed Google Scholar), although M-CSF induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ. Second, U-73122 did not inhibit the differentiation of WT19 cells by mGM-CSF at 1 μm, a concentration 10 times higher than that capable of inhibiting the M-CSF-mediated differentiation (22Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (data not shown).Although the single tyrosine mutation in the 681 hβc containing cell line had significant biologic effects, this mutation had no significant effect on differentiation in the wild-type receptor. The wild-type hβc contains four tyrosines C-terminal to Tyr-628. One of them (Tyr-882) has a similar amino acid sequence (YLSL) to Tyr-628 (YLCL). Two of them (Tyr-766 and Tyr-842) have a leucine at the +3 amino acid (YVEL and YCFL, respectively). The amino acid at +3 position of the tyrosine is important in dictating the binding affinity for many SH2 domain-containing proteins (32Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Brige R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

It is possible that a common signaling molecule binds to a number of tyrosines in the hβc-mediating cell differentiation so that, in the wild-type receptor, mutation of a single tyrosine is not sufficient to abolish cell differentiation.The role of ERKs in differentiation appears to be complex and may depend on the cell type and the stimulus involved. The ERK pathway has been suggested to be essential for the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells (27Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar, 34Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Also, interleukin 6 (IL-6) can induce PC12 differentiation when the cells are pretreated with nerve growth factor (35Ihara S. Iwamatsu A. Fujiyoshi T. Komi A. Yamori T. Fukui Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A mutation of a specific tyrosine in gp130, the IL-6 receptor signaling subunit involved in ERK activation, abolishes the induction of cell differentiation by IL-6 (23Ihara S. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Nagata S. Hirano T. Fukui Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5345-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the ERK pathway may not be involved in hGM-CSF-mediated differentiation of WT19 cells. 1) Although Tyr-628 of hβc was shown to be a binding site for SHP-2 SH2 domains (36Bone H. Dechert U. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), it was not necessary for hGM-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 or ERK activation (Fig. 6) (36Bone H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 2) PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK, blocked activation, but this compound had no significant effect on differentiation. 3) The expression of a constitutively active mutant of MEK in WT19 cells did not induce differentiation. 2T. Matsuguchi and A.Kraft, unpublished data. Thus, activation of ERK does not appear to be sufficient or necessary for hGM-CSF-induced differentiation of WT19 cells.Activation of Stat proteins by several cytokines has been suggested to be involved in cell differentiation (37Shimozaki K.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In WT19 cells transfected with hGM-CSFRα and wild-type hβc, hGM-CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both isoforms of Stat5, but not other Stat proteins (Stat1, Stat3, and Stat6 examined). Tyr-628 was not necessary for the hGM-CSF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of either Stat5a or 5b. In addition, both hβc628 and hβc681Y628F could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a and 5b in response to hGM-CSF equivalent to that seen in WT19 cells containing the wild-type receptor (Fig. 8). These results suggest that Stat5 activation is not sufficient for the induction of cellular differentiation. In a recent report, using chimeric receptors of erythropoietin and IL-3, a delayed activation of Stat5 was suggested to be important for the erythroid differentiation induction of BaF/3 cells (43Pless M. Norga K. Carroll M. Heim M.H. D'Andrea A.D. Mathey-Prevot B. Blood. 1997; 89: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we did not see a delay in the time course of Stat5 activation in WT19 transfectants which differentiate in response to hGM-CSF in contrast to those cell lines which are capable of only growth (data not shown). Thus, none of the signals examined (STAT5 activation along with SHP-2 and Shc phosphorylation) are sufficient to modulate differentiation.In conclusion, our data suggest that cell differentiation and cell growth induced by hGM-CSF are mediated by different regions of the hβc subunit. Attempts are underway to define the novel signals generated by amino acids 627–681 of the hβc which control the differentiated phenotype. By expressing truncated forms of hβc in WT19 cells, we demonstrated that hGM-CSF-induced morphological differentiation and the surface expression of F4/80 requires hβc subunits of 832, 796, or 681 amino acids in length (Fig. 3, Table I). In contrast, WT19 cells expressing hβc subunit containing 627 amino acids or less did not differentiate but were capable of growth in the presence of hGM-CSF (Fig. 3). Mutation of the two prolines in the box 1 region blocked both growth and differentiation. Thus, these results suggest that cell growth and differentiation are mediated by different regions of the receptor and that the signals generated by the box 1 region of the receptor are necessary for both cellular events. Similar results to those described above have been generated using M1 and WEHI-3B D+ cells as a target cell population for transfection (11Smith A. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, wild-type hβc and hβc783, but not hβc541 or 461, could mediate hGM-CSF-induced morphological change and differentiation marker induction, whereas induction of cell differentiation by hβc626 required a 50- to 100-fold higher concentration of hGM-CSF (M1 cells). However, in the WT19 cell system, neither hβc627 nor hβc681Y628F could induce cell differentiation even at a very high concentration (1 μg/ml) of hGM-CSF (data not shown). The results derived from M1 cells suggest that the region between amino acids 627 and 783 is necessary for the full differentiation signal, whereas our results more narrowly delineate the crucial region for differentiation to lie between 628 and 681. The results described here demonstrate that tyrosine 628 is highly phosphorylated after hGM-CSF treatment in vivo (Fig. 4). In the hβc681 construct, this phosphotyrosine is essential for differentiation. Tyr-627 and its surrounding amino acids are conserved between human and mouse βc (SLEYLCL), suggesting that in both species this tyrosine may play an important role in differentiation. In the macrophage colony stimulating factor signaling, both Tyr-807 and Tyr-721 of macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor were shown to be necessary for monocytic differentiation and for the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) (12Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The involvement of PLCγ in M-CSF-mediated cell differentiation was further demonstrated by the inhibition of differentiation using U-73122, a compound that acts as a specific inhibitor of PLCγ (22Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The surrounding amino acid sequence of hβc Tyr-628 (YLCL) is homologous to the optimal binding site for the N-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ in a phosphopeptide binding assay (32Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Brige R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) demonstrated in transfected COS-7 cells that Gα14 mediates responses evoked by the α1-adrenergic and the interleukin-8 receptors. Kuhnet al. (16Kuhn B. Schmid A. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) showed that histamine receptors couple to all Gαq family members.In this study, we have used the Xenopus oocyte system to investigate the coupling of native or expressed receptors to Gα14. Xenopus oocytes express an endogenous protease receptor that is activated by trypsin (24Durieux M.E. Salafranca M.N. Lynch K.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The response, typical for the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C signal transduction pathway, is manifested as Ca2+-dependent Cl− current. Trypsin, along with several other proteases, stimulates fertilization-like responses in starfish eggs (25Carroll D.J. Jafffe L.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). InXenopus oocytes, there is an elevation of G proteins of the Gαq family during maturation and early development (26Gallo C.J. Jones T.L.Z. Aragay A.M. Jaffe L.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These data suggest that protease receptors coupling via G proteins of the Gαq family may be of importance in fertilization and early development. Using the antisense approach, we show here that Gαq and Gα14 are the main mediators of the response elicited by trypsin, in contrast to the response evoked by the activation of GRP-Rs, which utilize Gαq and Gα11, and the response to activation of m1-Rs, which utilize Gαq and Gαo.DISCUSSIONAll G proteins of the Gαq family have been shown to couple to GPCRs in the pertussis-toxin-insensitive phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C signal transduction pathway. With the exception of our previous report in oocytes (1Shapira H. Way J. Lipinsky D. Oron Y. Battey J.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), transfection and reconstitution experiments failed to functionally discriminate between Gαq and Gα11. However, sequence and distribution differences (e.g. Ref. 4Milligan G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) between the two G proteins as well as among all the family members in general suggest individual physiological roles in regulating signaling in target tissues and organs. The antisense approach has the advantage of relying on the natural milieu of each component of the signal transduction pathway. By applying this approach in Xenopusoocytes, we have previously demonstrated functional in vivopreferences of neuromedin B receptor coupling via Gαq(1Shapira H. Way J. Lipinsky D. Oron Y. Battey J.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).To broaden the scope of the study, we have cloned XenopusGα14 in order to develop an antisense oligonucleotide that could be used to deplete cells of Gα14 protein. Similarly to the previously cloned Xenopus Gαqand Gα11, Xenopus Gα14 showed a high degree of homology to its mammalian counterpart, demonstrating the conservation of these protein sequences during vertebrate evolution. Northern analysis in oocytes demonstrated the intrafamily selectivity of the designed antisenses (antiGαq being less selective, degrading mainly Gαq but also Gα14) and the rapid elimination of the cognate mRNAs after antisense injection. Thus, proteins turnover rates were the limiting factor in the depletion process. The turnover rate of Gαq/11 has been shown in Chinese hamster ovary cells to fit a first-order reaction with a t½ of 18 h (33Mitchell F.M. Buckley N.J. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our data in oocytes, obtained from both Western analysis and functional assays, exhibit similar kinetics of degradation, but distinguish between Gαq and Gα11. The turnover rate of Gα14 was similar to that of Gα11. Our functional assays were executed 24–80 h after antisense injection, a time window in which most of the Gαq and more than 50% of Gα11 and Gα14 were degraded. Therefore, a 40% reduction in the m1 muscarinic response by either antiGαq or antiGα11 and the fact that this response was not further reduced after 48 and 80 h support the existence of an additional mediator for this receptor. Indeed, antiGαo caused a 20% reduction in the response to ACh 24 h after its injection. Mixtures of antiGαq/antiGα11 caused pronounced oocytes deterioration, preventing a more conclusive interpretation. We cannot exclude the possibility that even residual amounts of any G protein (undetectable by Western analysis) can mediate a full response, provided there is a large excess of G protein over the receptor and high affinity between the two proteins.The antisense oligonucleotides designed against the different G proteins could have achieved their effects by interfering with the synthesis of different phospholipase Cβ isoforms. This possibility, however, appears unlikely since there is no evidence for multiple phospholipase Cβ species in oocytes.Since there is little information about the Gα14 ability to couple GPCRs, we tested a number of receptors (mouse m1, GRP and neuromedin B receptors) and the native trypsin response to investigate its specificity. Only the endogenous protease receptor exhibited sensitivity to Gα14 depletion. Two antisense oligonucleotides, antiGαq and antiGα14, each diminished the responses to about 30%, and a mixture of the two reduced it to 7% that of control, whereas antiGα11 had no effect. These results strongly suggest that the response to trypsin is mediated exclusively by Gαq and Gα14. Although it appears that the contribution of these two G proteins to the trypsin response is similar, the limited degree of degradation of Gα14 mRNA caused by anti Gαq precludes a firm conclusion regarding this issue. Thus, Gα14mediates the response to protease in addition to its ability to couple α1-adrenergic, interleukin-8 receptors (17Wu D. Katz A. Lee C-H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wu D. LaRosa G.I. Simon M.I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9828-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have shown by altering selected domains within the third intracellular loop of the α1B-adrenergic receptor, sequence-related specificity for either Gαq/11 or Gα14. It would have been interesting to compare the sequence of the yet unclonedXenopus protease receptor, which appears to couple to Gαq and Gα14, but not to Gα11, with that of the α1B-adrenergic receptor.The finding that antiGα11 did not affect the response confirms our previous report that in vivo Gαqand Gα11 have distinct receptor preferences. It is interesting to note that so far in reconstitution, transfection, andin vivo models, every GPCR tested (with the possible exception of neuromedin B receptor expressed in oocytes, Ref. 1Shapira H. Way J. Lipinsky D. Oron Y. Battey J.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was able to couple to more than one G protein of the Gαqfamily. Since different GPCRs appear to be able to discriminate among the G proteins, the interaction of a single receptor with more than a single G protein implies biological significance. In this respect, the recent report by Macrez-Lepretre et al. (38Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 5261-5268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (71) Google Scholar) points to discrimination between Gαq and Gα11 for specific effector molecule in the signaling pathway. The G proteins specificity for the receptors on the one hand and for the distal parts of the signal transduction pathway on the other may serve to fine tune receptor-mediated biological responses. Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) of the Gαq family activate the phosphatidylinositol-bisphosphate-inositol-trisphosphate-calcium pathway in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. Among Gαq family members, Gαq and Gα11 share 88% homology and are expressed ubiquitously (2Strathmann M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Google Scholar, 3Milligan G. Mullaney I. McCallum F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Milligan G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Gα14 is 81% identical to Gαq and is restricted in its tissue distribution mainly to spleen, lung, kidney, and testes (5Wilkie T.M. Scherle P.A. Strathmann M.P. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10049-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Gα15 and its human counterpart, Gα16, show only 58 and 57% amino acid identity, respectively, to mouse Gαq and are restricted to a subset of hematopoietic cells (5Wilkie T.M. Scherle P.A.

The coexistence of closely related G proteins in the same cell suggests different functions or different interactions between individual G proteins and either receptors or phospholipases. However, in reconstitution systems and transfected cells, Gαq and Gα11 have been shown to couple indiscriminately to a wide range of receptors, e.g. muscarinic m1 receptor (m1-R) 1The abbreviations used are: m1-R, m1 muscarinic receptor; GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptors; GRP, gastrin-releasing peptide; GRP-R, GRP receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; S-oligos, phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: m1-R, m1 muscarinic receptor; GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptors; GRP, gastrin-releasing peptide; GRP-R, GRP receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; S-oligos, phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

Gα15/16, despite restricted distribution, are capable of coupling many serpentine receptors tested, including those natively coupled to Gαs and Gαi (for review, see Ref. 18Milligan G. Marshall F. Rees S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 15: 235-237Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similarly, an attempt to assign different roles to Gαq and Gα11 using agonist-induced down-regulation failed to distinguish between the two G proteins (19Milligan G.

This lack of discrimination may reflect real interchangeabilityin vivo among the G proteins of the Gαq family or merely be a result of the assays used. To address this question, we have used the Xenopus oocytes system to study receptor-G protein specificity in vivo. Coexpression of thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptors with either mouse Gαq or Gα11 demonstrated different modulation of the response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone by each one of these G proteins (22Lipinsky D. Gershengorn M.C. Oron Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Applying the antisense approach, we demonstrated for the first time different coupling preferences of neuromedin B receptor for Gαq and Gα11(1Shapira H. Way J. Lipinsky D. Oron Y. Battey J.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although some information is available for other Gαqfamily members, little is known of Gα14-receptor coupling specificity.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9828-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have shown by altering selected domains within the third intracellular loop of the α1B-adrenergic receptor, sequence-related specificity for either Gαq/11 or Gα14. It would have been interesting to compare the sequence of the yet unclonedXenopus protease receptor, which appears to couple to Gαq and Gα14, but not to Gα11, with that of the α1B-adrenergic receptor. The finding that antiGα11 did not affect the response confirms our previous report that in vivo Gαqand Gα11 have distinct receptor preferences. It is interesting to note that so far in reconstitution, transfection, andin vivo models, every GPCR tested (with the possible exception of neuromedin B receptor expressed in oocytes, Ref. 1Shapira H. Way J. Lipinsky D. Oron Y. Battey J.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was able to couple to more than one G protein of the Gαqfamily. Since different GPCRs appear to be able to discriminate among the G proteins, the interaction of a single receptor with more than a single G protein implies biological significance. In this respect, the recent report by Macrez-Lepretre et al. (38Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 5261-5268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (71) Google Scholar) points to discrimination between Gαq and Gα11 for specific effector molecule in the signaling pathway. The G proteins specificity for the receptors on the one hand and for the distal parts of the signal transduction pathway on the other may serve to fine tune receptor-mediated biological responses. We are indebted to Dr. P. Sternweis for his generous donation of anti-G protein antibodies and to Dr. T. Jones for her gift of the QL antiserum."
