https://openalex.org/W1997663834,"Experimental acidification of a small lake from an original pH value of 6.8 to 5.0 over an 8-year period caused a number of dramatic changes in the lake's food web. Changes in phytoplankton species, cessation of fish reproduction, disappearance of the benthic crustaceans, and appearance of filamentous algae in the littoral zone were consistent with deductions from synoptic surveys of lakes in regions of high acid deposition. Contrary to what had been expected from synoptic surveys, acidification of Lake 223 did not cause decreases in primary production, rates of decomposition, or nutrient concentrations. Key organisms in the food web leading to lake trout, including Mysis relicta and Pimephales promelas, were eliminated from the lake at pH values as high as 5.8, an indication that irreversible stresses on aquatic ecosystems occur earlier in the acidification process than was heretofore believed. These changes are caused by hydrogen ion alone, and not by the secondary effect of aluminum toxicity. Since no species of fish reproduced at pH values below 5.4, the lake would become fishless within about a decade on the basis of the natural mortalities of the most long-lived species."

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which controls interocean mixing, flows through this passage. The parameter epsilon(Nd)(0) which is a function of the ratio of neodymium-143 to neodymium-144, is found to be uniform with depth at two stations with a value which is intermediate between the values for the Atlantic and the Pacific and indicates that the Antarctic Circumpolar current consists of about 70 percent Atlantic water. Cold bottom water from a site in the south central Pacific has the neodymium isotopic signature of the waters in the Drake Passage. By using a box model to describe the exchange of water between the Southern Ocean and the ocean basins to the north together with the isotopic results, an upper limit of approximately 33 million cubic meters per second is calculated for the rate of exchange between the Pacific and the Southern Ocean. Concentrations of samarium and neodymium were also determined and found to increase approximately linearly with depth. These results suggest that neodymium may be a valuable tracer in oceanography and may be useful in paleo-oceanographic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2003415539,"Measurements of the ratio of helium-4 to helium-3 and of calcium ion in the pore waters of sediments at two locations in the eastern equatorial Pacific indicate that solution advection is occurring through the sediments. Both the helium ratio and the calcium ion profile yield velocity values for advective flow of about 20 centimeters per year. Mass balance constraints are also consistent with the interpretation presented. Flow appears to be occurring thorugh relatively thick sediments, on the order of 300 meters."

https://openalex.org/W2003026866,Classical edge diffraction patterns are formed at centimeter wavelengths by several features of Saturn's rings. These patterns were discovered in 3.6-and 13-centimeter radio signals from Voyager 1 during occultation by the rings. The observed shapes are in agreement with theoretical patterns computed for screens of perfectly abrupt edges having large but finite opacity. Comparison with models in which the opacity at the edge tapers to zero from a finite value sets a new bound of less than about 200 meters on the microwave edge thickness. Certain features of the data suggest a smaller upper bound of about 130 meters on the edge thickness.

https://openalex.org/W2010758128,"Young stellar objects of both high and low luminosity emit energetic jets or winds of material that are often highly collimated and often bipolar. Near the stars, turbulent swept-up gas is observed in the emission of interstellar molecules such as carbon monoxide, and small, bright regions of water maser emission and the nebulous bright patches known as Herbig-Haro objects appear to be participating in the outflows. There are striking changes in chemical abundances associated with the attendant shocks. Probably every star goes through this phase, which may mark the end of its period of accretion."

Sacred, profane and mythological literature abound in incident, fact and fancy, showing that from earliest times man has sought to assuage grief and pain by some means of dulling consciousness. Recourse was had to the inhalation of fumes from various substances, weird incantations, application of drugs, both external and internal, pressure upon important nerves and blood vessels, and the laying on of hands, or animal magnetism. Each has played its part in the mitigation of human ills. It was not until the close of the eighteenth century, however, that modern surgical anesthesia was foreshadowed. Then it was that the discovery of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and nitrous oxidepneumatic chemistry, as it were-created a field of pneumatic medicine. In 1789, the Pneumatic Institute was founded for the purpose of investigating the medical powers of factitious airs or gages and was set up at Clifton by Dr. Beddoes. The immediate idea to be followed out was the treatment of phthisis and other lung troubles by inhalation of various gases. Humphry Davy was assigned the office of superintending the experiments. Davy actually inhaled nitrous oxide, and re-"

https://openalex.org/W4248337825,"In the Research News article by Jean L. Marx, ""The polyphosphoinositides revisited"" (19 Apr., p. 312), the discovery of inositol 1,3,4-tris-phosphate was erroneously attributed to Michael Berridge of Cambridge University. Although Berridge presented some of the data at the Smith Kline & French symposium, the work was actually done by his Cambridge colleagues Robin Irvine and Peter Downes."

https://openalex.org/W2003823090,"The nervous system forms an elaborate connecting link between the sense organs, which respond to various external and internal stimuli, and effector organs such as muscles, glands and luminous structures, through which the insect reacts to the stimuli by coordinated behavioural changes (Schmitt, 1962; Roeder, 1963; Smith and Treherne, 1963; Gouin, 1965; Horridge, 1965; Treherne and Beament, 1965; Treherne, 1966, 1974; Hoyle, 1970). In addition, some nerve cells have a special secretory role (p. 273) and the integrity of the nervous system may be required for normal development and regeneration of other tissues (Finlayson, 1960; Nuesch, 1968). The nervous system is composed essentially of ramifying neuroglial cells with supporting and nutritive functions (Wigglesworth, 1960; Smith, 1967) and the more numerous neurons, which are highly specialized for the relatively rapid generation and conduction of electrochemical nervous impulses (Pipa, 1961; Landolt, 1965; Chiarodo, 1969; Sohal et al., 1972). Processes of each neuron put it into contact by synaptic junctions with other nerve cells (Chiarodo et al., 1970) or with sensory structures or effector organs. One or more of these processes forms a long conducting fibre or axon (Narahashi, 1963) ending in a group of fine, branching fibrils; the number of axons enables the neuron to be classified as uni-, bi- or multipolar."
