We have demonstrated that AKT, which is activated downstream from epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, phosphorylates β-catenin at Ser552 in vitro and in vivo. AKT-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin causes its disassociation from cell-cell contacts and accumulation in both the cytosol and the nucleus and enhances its interaction with 14-3-3ζ via a binding motif containing Ser552. Phosphorylation of β-catenin by AKT increases its transcriptional activity and promotes tumor cell invasion, indicating that AKT-dependent regulation of β-catenin plays a critical role in tumor invasion and development.

Genetic and embryologic studies have revealed that β-catenin is also a component of the Wnt signaling pathway and that it exhibits signaling functions (4Kikuchi A. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In the absence of a Wnt/Wingless signal, cytoplasmic β-catenin interacts with axin/conductin, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), 3The abbreviations used are: GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; TCF/LEF-1, T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor 1; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase. and the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, which competes with E-cadherin for binding to the armadillo-like repeats of β-catenin (5Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is phosphorylated in its N-terminal domain by GSK-3β, which leads to its degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway mediated by SKP1/CUL1/F-box E3 ligase (6Aberle H.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Activation of the Wnt/Wingless pathway inhibits GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin. Stabilized, hypophosphorylated β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors of the TCF/LEF-1 family, leading to the increased expression of genes, such as MYC and CCND1 (12He T.C.

Hepatocyte growth factor and epidermal growth factor (EGF) induce β-catenin signaling under conditions where they stimulate cell motility (15Muller T. Bain G. Wang X. Papkoff J. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 280: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Lu Z. Ghosh S. Wang Z. Hunter T. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 499-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Gain of function mutations in β-catenin, including N-terminal mutations that lead to stabilization of the protein or loss of function mutations in proteins that participate in the regulated turnover of β-catenin, such as the tumor suppressor APC, result in up-regulation of β-catenin protein levels, thus increasing its transcriptional activity. Increased β-catenin-TCF/LEF-1 transactivation by enhanced β-catenin stability, resulting from mutations in APC, AXIN1, or CTNNB1 (which encodes β-catenin), is found in a wide variety of human cancers, including colon cancer, desmoid tumor, gastric cancer, hepatocarcinoma, medulloblastoma, melanoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer (17Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 19Morin P.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Mutations of Wnt pathway proteins that alter the stability of β-catenin are not the only factor that contributes to β-catenin activation. For instance, in 12 of 20 (60.0%) endometrial cancers, β-catenin was found to accumulate in the nucleus, which is a hallmark of β-catenin activation, whereas there were only two instances of mutations in the CTNNB1 gene (20Ashihara K. Saito T. Mizumoto H. Nishimura M. Tanaka R. Kudo R. Med. Electron Microsc. 2002; 35: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similarly, only 1 of 65 primary melanomas had detectable CTNNB1 mutations, with a third of the cases displaying nuclear accumulation of β-catenin (21Rimm D.L. Caca K. Hu G. Harrison F.B. Fearon E.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 325-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Moreover, nearly 50% of hepatocellular carcinomas, in which the APC gene is rarely mutated, reveal nuclear accumulation of β-catenin protein, and genetic alterations in CTNNB1 are detected only in 16–26% of the tumors (22de La Coste A.

Clearly, more than one mechanism regulates the activity of β-catenin (26Lu Z. Hunter T. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 571-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to EGF stimulation, β-catenin translocates into the nucleus and increases its transactivation without altering its stability and phosphorylation level by GSK-3β (16Lu Z. Ghosh S. Wang Z. Hunter T. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 499-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Granulocyte-macrophage progenitors as candidate leukemic stem cells in blast-crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia have high nuclear β-catenin accumulation presumably, driven by Bcr-Abl (27Jamieson C.H.

Med. 2004; 351: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that AKT phosphorylates β-catenin at Ser552, which leads to its disassociation from cell-cell contacts, increases its binding to 14-3-3ζ and its transcriptional activity and enhances invasion by tumor cells. Cells and Cell Culture Conditions—A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, CHO AA8 cells, and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Cell cultures were made quiescent by growing them to confluence and then replacing the medium with fresh medium containing 0.5% serum for 1 day. Materials—Rabbit monoclonal antibody recognizing phosphorylated RRX(S/T) peptide was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Polyclonal antibody for 14-3-3ζ and monoclonal antibodies for β-catenin (E-5) and HA were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal phospho-β-catenin (Ser33/Ser37)-specific antibody, mouse monoclonal antibodies for FLAG and tubulin, and EGF were purchased from Sigma, along with Hygromycin, AKT inhibitor IV, active His-tagged AKT1 (purified from insect cells), and protein kinase A (purified from bovine heart) from EMD Biosciences. Active GST-AKT2 (purified from insect cells) was obtained from Biomol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA), Hoechst 33342, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and HyFect transfection reagents was from Denville Scientific (Metuchen, NJ). GelCode Blue Stain Reagent was obtained from Pierce. Transfection—Cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105/60-mm-diameter dish 18 h prior to transfection. Transfection was performed using either calcium phosphate or HyFect reagents (Deveville Scientific) according to the vendor's instructions. Transfected cultures were selected with hygromycin (200 μg/ml) for 10–14 days at 37 °C. At that time, antibiotic-resistant colonies were picked, pooled, and expanded for further analysis under selective conditions. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Analysis—Extraction of proteins with a modified buffer from cultured cells was followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with corresponding antibodies, as described previously (28Lu Z. Liu D. Hornia A. Devonish W. Pagano M. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). DNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—A PCR-amplified human β-catenin cDNA was cloned either into pColdI vector (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) between BamHI and HindIII or into pcDNA3.1/hygro(+)-FLAG vector between BamHI and NotI. pColdI-β-catenin S552A or S675A and pcDNA3.1-FLAG-β-catenin S552A, S552D, or S675A were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pcDNA3.1 HA-AKT1 DD, HA-AKT2 DD, and HA-AKT1 AAA have been described previously (29Kuo M.T. Liu Z. Wei Y. Lin-Lee Y.C. Tatebe S. Mills G.B. Unate H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1945-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The wild-type (WT) and mutants of His-β-catenin protein were expressed in bacteria and purified, as described previously (30Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In Vitro Invasion Assay—Cell invasion was assessed by the invasion of the cells through Matrigel-coated Transwell inserts. Briefly, Transwell inserts with a 12-μm pore size were coated with 100 μl of a final concentration of 0.78 mg/ml Matrigel in cold serum-free medium. Cells were trypsinized, and cell suspension (500 μl; 1 × 106 cells/ml) was added in triplicate wells. After a 24-h incubation, cells that invaded the Matrigel and passed through the filter were stained with crystal violet and photographed using a digital camera mounted onto a microscope with ×50 magnification. The membranes were dissolved in 4% deoxycholic acid and read colorimetrically at 590 nm. In Vitro Kinase Assays—The kinase reactions were done by mixing purified His-β-catenin with or without purified active AKT or PKA in kinase assay buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were then separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for exposing to x-ray film. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—To measure the transcriptional activity of TCF/LEF-1, CHO cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1.5 × 104 cells/well. Twenty-four h after seeding, TCF/LEF-1 reporter (pTOP-FLASH) or control vector (pFOP-FLASH) were transiently transfected with 0.2 μg of WT or mutants of β-catenin together with or without 0.2 μg of AKT1 DD, 0.2 μg of 14-3-3ζ, or 0.2 μg of pEGFR. Twelve h after transfection, the medium was replaced with 0.1% serum for another 12–24 h, and EGF (100 ng/ml) was added 6 h before harvesting. Ten μl out of the 100-μl cell extract were used for measuring luciferase activity. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells were fixed and incubated with primary antibodies, Alexa Fluor dye-conjugated secondary antibodies, and Hoechst 33342, according to standard protocols. Cells were examined using a deconvolutional microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a 63-Å oil immersion objective. Axio Vision software from Zeiss was used to deconvolute Z-series images. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—The GelCode Blue-stained gel band was digested in-gel with 200 ng of modified trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) at 37 °C for 24 h. Resulting peptides were analyzed by Nano-liquid chromatography-coupled ion trap mass spectrometry with on-line desalting on a system consisting of a Famos® autosampler, an Ultimate® Nano-LC module, and a Switchos® pre-column switching device (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale CA) on a 75-μm × 150-mm C-18 column (Dionex Corp.). Electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry was performed on an LTQ linear ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo, San Jose, CA). A portion of the digest was desalted (C18-ZipTip, Millipore, MA) and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight(Voyager DE-STR, Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Proteins were identified by data base search of the fragment spectra against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein data base using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK) and Sequest (Thermo, San Jose, CA). Isolation of Nuclei, Cytosol, and Membrane—Nuclei, cytosol, and membrane of cells were isolated using the nuclear extract kit from Active Motif North America (Carlsbad, CA) and the ProteoExtract® subcellular proteome extraction kit from Calbiochem. Pulse-Chase Analysis—293T cells transfected with FLAG-tagged WT or mutants of β-catenin for 2 days were incubated in the absence of methionine for 20 min, pulse-labeled for 1 h with 250 μCi/ml [35S] methionine, washed twice, and incubated in medium containing excess unlabeled methionine for 0, 24, 36, or 48 h. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. Samples were then separated on 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for exposure to x-ray film. AKT Phosphorylates β-Catenin at Ser552 in Vitro and in Vivo—We previously showed that EGF stimulation results in translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus and increased transcriptional activity without altering its stability and phosphorylation level by GSK-3β (16Lu Z. Ghosh S. Wang Z. Hunter T. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 499-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). To examine whether the increased transcriptional activity of β-catenin is due to a possible unknown posttranslational modification, we analyzed a tryptic digest of β-catenin immunoprecipitated from EGF-stimulated A431 cells with mass spectrometry. One candidate phosphopeptide spanning amino acids 550–565 was detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Ser552 was then identified as a phosphorylation site in this β-catenin peptide by liquid chromatography-coupled ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Fig. 1A) (the presence of Arg at the N terminus of the peptide is due to the known inefficient tryptic digestion of the RX bond in RXpS). The 547TQRRTS552 sequence of β-catenin is closely related to the AKT phosphorylation motif RXRXX(S/T) (31Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and the PKA phosphorylation consensus sequence (R/K)2X(S/T) (32Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this sequence was also recognized as an AKT or PKA-putative phosphorylation site by using the motif-based profile-scanning ScanSite program. To identify the kinase-phosphorylating β-catenin at Ser552, we performed in vitro kinase assays with purified active AKT1, AKT2, or PKA mixed with purified WT His-β-catenin, His-β-catenin S552A, or His-β-catenin S675A, in which the known PKA phosphorylation residue was mutated to Ala (33Taurin S.

Biol. 2005; 25: 9063-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). As expected, and consistent with previous publications (33Taurin S. Sandbo N. Qin Y. Browning D. Dulin N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9971-9976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 34Hino S. Tanji C. Nakayama K.I. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9063-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), PKA phosphorylated β-catenin, and this phosphorylation was largely abrogated by mutation at Ser675 but not at Ser552 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, both active AKT1 and active AKT2 were able to phosphorylate β-catenin, and incubation with AKT inhibitor IV (35Kau T.R. Schroeder F. Ramaswamy S. Wojciechowski C.L. Zhao J.J. Roberts T.M. Clardy J. Sellers W.R. Silver P.A. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 463-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) or mutation at Ser552 but not at Ser675 abolished these effects. Furthermore, phosphorylated WT β-catenin and β-catenin S675A, but not β-catenin S552A, could be detected by a commercial antibody recognizing phosphorylated RRX(S/T) peptide, indicating that this antibody can specifically detect phosphorylated β-catenin at Ser552. (This antibody did not recognize PKA-phosphorylated Ser675 (data not shown). These results indicate that AKT, but not PKA, phosphorylates β-catenin at Ser552 in vitro. To test whether AKT phosphorylates β-catenin in vivo, constitutively active AKT1 DD (T308D/S473D) was co-transfected with FLAG-tagged WT β-catenin, β-catenin S552A, or β-catenin S675A into 293T cells. Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged protein with the phospho-β-catenin Ser552 antibody showed that active AKT1 induces phosphorylation of WT β-catenin and β-catenin S675A but not the β-catenin S552A mutant (Fig. 1C). Similarly, constitutively active AKT2 DD (T309D/S474D) was capable of inducing phosphorylation of WT β-catenin but not the β-catenin S552A mutant. These results indicate that β-catenin was phosphorylated by AKT at Ser552 but not Ser675 in vivo. EGF treatment activates AKT (36Henson E.S. Gibson S.B. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 2089-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To test the effect of EGF stimulation on β-catenin phosphorylation, A431 cells were treated with EGF for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 1D, EGF induced phosphorylation of endogenous β-catenin at Ser552, which was blocked by pretreatment with AKT inhibitor IV. This is consistent with β-catenin phosphorylation at Ser552 in response to EGF treatment, as detected by mass spectrometry. β-Catenin Phosphorylated by AKT Disassociates from Cell Contacts and Translocates into the Cytosol and Nucleus—β-Catenin localized in different cellular compartments forms distinct complexes and executes differential cellular functions. To examine whether β-catenin phosphorylation by AKT affects its subcellular distribution, a constitutively active AKT1 DD or an AKT1 AAA (K179A/T308A/S473A) kinase-dead mutant was transfected into A431 cells. Expression of AKT1 DD, but not AKT1 AAA, resulted in translocation of a portion of β-catenin from cell-cell contacts into the cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 2A). Similar data were also observed following expression of AKT2 DD and AKT2 AAA (data not shown). Furthermore, a phosphorylation-mimic β-catenin S552D mutant, in which Ser was mutated into Asp, showed significantly increased cytosolic and nuclear localization in contrast to WT or S552A mutant of β-catenin that was primarily localized in cell-cell contacts (Fig. 2B). Consistently, immunoblotting experiments detected an increase in cytosolic and nuclear β-catenin S552D mutant in contrast to its WT, whereas the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin S552A mutant was reduced (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the amount of the nuclear protein lamin B remained unchanged (Fig. 2C), and we did not detect any E-cadherin in the nuclear fractions, indicating that the nuclear preparations were free of cytosolic contaminants (data not shown). Correlating with the differential redistribution of β-catenin S552D and S552A mutants in the cytosol and nuclei, reduced membrane-bound β-catenin S552D and increased membrane-bound β-catenin S552A were detected in contrast to WT β-catenin (Fig. 2C). To test whether the differential distribution of the WT and mutants of β-catenin affected their phosphorylation by GSK-3β, which leads to proteasomal degradation of β-catenin, immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged WT β-catenin, β-catenin S552A, and β-catenin S552D were immunoblotted with phospho-β-catenin (S33/S37) antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D, β-catenin S552A and β-catenin S552D have comparable phosphorylation by GSK-3β to WT β-catenin. Furthermore, pulse-chase analyses revealed that transiently expressed FLAG-tagged β-catenin S552A and β-catenin S552D had a comparable half-life to WT β-catenin (quantified by scanning densitometry) (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that β-catenin phosphorylation by AKT leads to its disassociation from cell-cell contacts without altering its phosphorylation by GSK-3β. β-Catenin Phosphorylated by AKT Increases Its Association with 14-3-3ζ—14-3-3 proteins function as key regulators of signal transduction by binding to specific phospho-Ser/Thr-containing sequence motifs within a wide range of target proteins (37Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). It has been shown that 14-3-3ζ is a β-catenin-associated protein and can facilitate β-catenin transactivation by AKT (38Tian Q. Feetham M.C. Tao W.A. He X.C. Li L. Aebersold R. Hood L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 binding motif RX1–2pS/pTX2–3, in which a Ser or a Thr at position –1 and/or –2 with respect to phosphoserine is found in many 14-3-3-binding proteins (39Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar), and (R/K)(X)XXp(S/T)XP (37Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) is closely related to 549RRTSMG554 of β-catenin. To examine the effect of β-catenin phosphorylated by AKT on its association with 14-3-3ζ, FLAG-tagged WT β-catenin was co-transfected with and without a kinase-dead AKT1 AAA mutant or AKT1 DD into 293T cells. Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated 14-3-3ζ with anti-FLAG antibody showed that expression of constitutively active AKT1, in contrast to its kinase-dead mutant, significantly increased the interaction between 14-3-3ζ and β-catenin (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the activity of AKT in facilitating this association, the β-catenin S552A mutant, in contrast to WTβ-catenin, was reduced in its binding to 14-3-3ζ, whereas the phosphorylation-mimic β-catenin S552D mutant bound more 14-3-3ζ (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser552 by AKT increases the association between β-catenin and 14-3-3ζ. Phosphorylation of β-Catenin by AKT Increases Transcriptional Activity of β-Catenin and Enhances Tumor Cell Invasion—Nuclearly localized β-catenin interacts with transcription factors of the TCF/LEF-1 family, leading to the increased expression of downstream genes. β-Catenin phosphorylated by AKT translocated into the nucleus. To test the effect of β-catenin phosphorylation by AKT on TCF/LEF-1 transcriptional activity, the TCF/LEF-1 luciferase reporter TOP-FLASH or a control vector FOP-FLASH was co-transfected with and without constitutively active AKT1 DD with WT β-catenin or β-catenin S552A mutant. Expression of active AKT1 increased TCF/LEF-1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 4A). In contrast to WT β-catenin, β-catenin S552A had reduced transcriptional activity, either in the absence or in the presence of active AKT1. Furthermore, expression of β-catenin S552A reduced the 14-3-3ζ-enhancing effect of active AKT1 DD (Fig. 4B) or EGF-induced TCF/LEF-1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the increased nuclear localization, expression of phosphorylation-mimic mutant β-catenin S552D significantly increased TCF/LEF-1 transcriptional activity, in contrast to WT β-catenin (Fig. 4D). β-Catenin transcriptional activity has been closely related to tumor development. To examine the effect of phosphorylation of β-catenin by AKT on tumor cell invasion, A431 cells were stably transfected with WT β-catenin, β-catenin S552A, or β-catenin S552D, and a Matrigel invasion assay was carried out. Although expression of β-catenin S552A moderately reduced cell invasion, in contrast to cell expression of WT β-catenin, expression of β-catenin S552D significantly enhanced tumor cell invasion (Fig. 4, E and F). These results indicate that β-catenin phosphorylation by AKT promotes tumor cell invasion. β-Catenin, functioning as a major component of both Wnt signaling and cell-cell adhesion, plays a central role in cell proliferation, differentiation, polarity, morphogenesis, and development (40Wodarz A.

Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3529-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Catenin localized in different cellular compartments forms distant complexes that carry out differential cellular functions. We show here that β-catenin distribution can be dynamically regulated, and phosphorylation of β-catenin by AKT results in the relocalization of some β-catenin from cell-cell contracts and increase in its transcriptional activity. Activating mutations of Wnt components lead to nuclear localization of β-catenin and are involved in tumor formation and development (44Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Wnt-independent signaling, nevertheless, is also involved in regulation of β-catenin transactivation and tumorigenesis (26Lu Z. Hunter T. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 571-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Catenin-TCF/LEF-1 signaling can be activated by growth factors, such as EGF, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin-like growth factor-II, and insulin (15Muller T.

Soluble oligomers have been observed at early time points preceding fibril formation, and these oligomers have been implicated as the primary pathological species rather than the mature fibrils. A significant issue that remains to be resolved is whether amyloid oligomers are an obligate intermediate on the pathway to fibril formation or represent an alternate assembly pathway that may or may not lead to fiber formation. To determine whether amyloid β oligomers are obligate intermediates in the fibrillization pathway, we characterized the mechanism of action of amyloid β aggregation inhibitors in terms of oligomer and fibril formation. Based on their effects, the small molecules segregated into three distinct classes: compounds that inhibit oligomerization but not fibrillization, compounds that inhibit fibrillization but not oligomerization, and compounds that inhibit both. Several compounds selectively inhibited oligomerization at substoichiometric concentrations relative to amyloid β monomer, with some active in the low nanomolar range. These results indicate that oligomers are not an obligate intermediate in the fibril formation pathway. In addition, these data suggest that small molecule inhibitors are useful for clarifying the mechanisms underlying protein aggregation and may represent potential therapeutic agents that target fundamental disease mechanisms.

Protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils is a pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD). 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; Aβ, amyloid β protein; Aβ42, amyloid β protein containing 42 amino acids; BSB, (trans, trans)-1-bromo-2,5-bis-(3-hydroxycarbonyl-4-hydroxy)styrylbenzene; C17, trimethyl(tetradecyl)ammonium bromide; C16, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide; TBS-T, Tris-buffered saline containing 0.01% Tween 20; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; ThT, thioflavin T; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; AR, anti-rabbit IgG; HFIP, hexafluoroisopropanol; ADDL, Aβ-derived diffusable ligand. AD is characterized, in part, by the aggregation of amyloid β protein (Aβ) into fibrillar amyloid plaques in select areas of the brain (1Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence indicates that Aβ aggregation is critical for neurodegeneration, suggesting that preventing this process may be an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD (2Hardy J.

Lett. 1995; 197: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, Aβ aggregation is a complicated process and appears to involve more than a simple conversion of soluble monomer to fiber. More recent evidence has pointed to the role of soluble amyloid oligomers or prefibrillar aggregation intermediates as the primary toxic species in degenerative amyloid diseases (2Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (9917) Google Scholar, 3Glabe C.C. Subcell. Biochem. 2005; 38: 167-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy have identified spherical particles of ∼3–10 nm that appear at early times of incubation and disappear as mature fibrils appear (26Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These spherical oligomers appear to represent intermediates in the pathway of fibril formation, because they are transiently observed at intermediate times of incubation during fibril formation. Although oligomers are kinetic intermediates, it is not yet clear whether they are obligate intermediates in the pathway for fibril formation, whether they coalesce directly to form fibrils (26Harper J.D.

This same controversy extends to the aggregation of many other amyloidogenic proteins, since many types of amyloids display the same type of kinetically unstable intermediate, the soluble oligomer.

Therefore, the published data are equivocal as to whether oligomers are intermediates on the pathway leading to fiber formation or whether they represent “off pathway” aggregates that populate an alternative aggregation pathway (51Gorman P.M.

These structures have also been called “protofibrils,” because they appear to be formed by the coalescence of the spherical subunits (26Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These prefibrillar soluble oligomers are specifically recognized by a polyclonal antibody, A11, 3Nomenclature is as follows. A11 is an anti-oligomer-specific antibody (58Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). Inhibition of oligomerization refers to inhibition of formation of A11-immunoreactive oligomers. An inhibitor of oligomerization refers to a molecule that inhibits the formation of A11-immunoreactive oligomers. “Oligomerization conditions” refer to conditions that favor A11-reactive oligomer visualization. “Fibrillization conditions” refer to conditions that favor fiber formation in the absence of contamination with A11-positive oligomers. Fibrillization conditions and oligomerization conditions represent a nomenclature used for the sole purpose of describing conditions where Aβ42 forms oligomer-free fibers or fiber-free oligomers (at early time points), respectively. These conditions allow separate screening of effects of compounds on fiber or oligomer formation. This nomenclature is not meant to indicate that these are the best or the only conditions to prepare fibers and oligomers. that recognizes a generic backbone epitope that is common to the oligomeric state independent of the protein sequence (58Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). A11 does not recognize Aβ monomer, Aβ dimer, trimer, or tetramer or Aβ fibrils (58Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). A11 positive oligomers display the same intermediate kinetics as observed for soluble oligomers and protofibrils by electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy and A11 blocks the toxicity of Aβ oligomers, indicating that they represent the primary toxic species. Aβ*56 is a soluble oligomeric form of Aβ that is closely associated with pathogenesis in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD, and Aβ*56 is specifically recognized by A11 anti-oligomer antibody (59Lesne S. Koh M.T. Kotilinek L. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Yang A. Gallagher M. Ashe K.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Although ADDLs were originally described as low molecular weight trimeric or tetrameric species, more recent investigations indicate that native masses of ADDLs are the same as previously reported for other Aβ-soluble oligomers (60Hepler R.W. Grimm K.M. Nahas D.D. Breese R. Dodson E.C. Acton P. Keller P.M. Yeager M. Wang H. Shughrue P. Kinney G. Joyce J.G. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15157-15167Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A11 and anti-ADDL antibodies identify the same time course of soluble oligomer accumulation in the 3xTg-AD mouse (61Oddo S. Caccamo A. Tran L. Lambert M.P. Glabe C.G. Klein W.L. LaFerla F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1599-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Therefore, A11 antibody recognizes a significant and important class of oligomers associated with AD that are distinct from amyloid fibrils. Analysis of the mechanism of action of amyloid aggregation inhibitors holds the promise of clarifying the relationship between oligomers and fibrils, because if oligomers are obligate intermediates on the pathway to fibril formation, then all inhibitors that block oligomer formation would be expected to block fibril formation as well. Alternatively, if fibrils and oligomers represent distinct aggregation pathways, then it would be expected that some inhibitors would block oligomerization but not fibril formation. Here we utilize the anti-oligomer antibody, A11, as a primary read out for oligomer formation, and we analyze the mechanism of action of small molecules that have been reported to inhibit the aggregation of different amyloidogenic proteins or their toxicity. The results demonstrate that some inhibitors specifically target oligomers, whereas others specifically inhibit fibrillization. These data indicate that soluble oligomers are not an obligate intermediate for fibril formation and that oligomers and fibrils represent separate and distinct aggregation pathways. The results further indicate that screening for aggregation inhibitors using fibril-specific assays, like thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, will not necessarily identify inhibitors of oligomerization.

https://openalex.org/W1980933256,"Embryonic stem (ES) cells are promising for cardiac repair, but directing their differentiation toward cardiomyocytes remains challenging. We investigated whether the heart guides ES cells toward cardiomyocytes in vivo and whether allogeneic ES cells were immunologically tolerated. Undifferentiated mouse ES cells consistently formed cardiac teratomas in nude or immunocompetent syngeneic mice. Cardiac teratomas contained no more cardiomyocytes than hind-limb teratomas, suggesting lack of guided differentiation. ES cells also formed teratomas in infarcted hearts, indicating injury-related signals did not direct cardiac differentiation. Allogeneic ES cells also caused cardiac teratomas, but these were immunologically rejected after several weeks, in association with increased inflammation and up-regulation of class I and II histocompatibility antigens. Fusion between ES cells and cardiomyocytes occurred in vivo, but was rare. Infarct autofluorescence was identified as an artifact that might be mistaken for enhanced GFP expression and true regeneration. Hence, undifferentiated ES cells were not guided toward a cardiomyocyte fate in either normal or infarcted hearts, and there was no evidence for allogeneic immune tolerance of ES cell derivatives. Successful cardiac repair strategies involving ES cells will need to control cardiac differentiation, avoid introducing undifferentiated cells, and will likely require immune modulation to avoid rejection."

We report here the development of several peptide nanofiber scaffolds designed specifically for osteoblasts. We designed one of the pure self-assembling peptide scaffolds RADA16-I through direct coupling to short biologically active motifs. The motifs included osteogenic growth peptide ALK (ALKRQGRTLYGF) bone-cell secreted-signal peptide, osteopontin cell adhesion motif DGR (DGRGDSVAYG) and 2-unit RGD binding sequence PGR (PRGDSGYRGDS). We made the new peptide scaffolds by mixing the pure RAD16 and designer-peptide solutions, and we examined the molecular integration of the mixed nanofiber scaffolds using AFM. Compared to pure RAD16 scaffold, we found that these designer peptide scaffolds significantly promoted mouse pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. Moreover, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin secretion, which are early and late markers for osteoblastic differentiation, were also significantly increased. We demonstrated that the designer, self-assembling peptide scaffolds promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1. Under the identical culture medium condition, confocal images unequivocally demonstrated that the designer PRG peptide scaffold stimulated cell migration into the 3-D scaffold. Our results suggest that these designer peptide scaffolds may be very useful for promoting bone tissue regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2130276289,"At least five arenaviruses cause viral haemorrhagic fevers in humans. Lassa virus, an Old World arenavirus, uses the cellular receptor alpha-dystroglycan to infect cells. Machupo, Guanarito, Junin and Sabia viruses are New World haemorrhagic fever viruses that do not use alpha-dystroglycan. Here we show a specific, high-affinity association between transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and the entry glycoprotein (GP) of Machupo virus. Expression of human TfR1, but not human transferrin receptor 2, in hamster cell lines markedly enhanced the infection of viruses pseudotyped with the GP of Machupo, Guanarito and Junin viruses, but not with those of Lassa or lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses. An anti-TfR1 antibody efficiently inhibited the replication of Machupo, Guanarito, Junin and Sabia viruses, but not that of Lassa virus. Iron depletion of culture medium enhanced, and iron supplementation decreased, the efficiency of infection by Junin and Machupo but not Lassa pseudoviruses. These data indicate that TfR1 is a cellular receptor for New World haemorrhagic fever arenaviruses."

https://openalex.org/W2149864958,"Cancer gene discovery has relied extensively on analyzing tumors for gains and losses to reveal the location of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, respectively. Deletions of 1p36 are extremely common genetic lesions in human cancer, occurring in malignancies of epithelial, neural, and hematopoietic origin. Although this suggests that 1p36 harbors a gene that drives tumorigenesis when inactivated, the identity of this tumor suppressor has remained elusive. Here we use chromosome engineering to generate mouse models with gain and loss of a region corresponding to human 1p36. This approach functionally identifies chromodomain helicase DNA binding domain 5 (Chd5) as a tumor suppressor that controls proliferation, apoptosis, and senescence via the p19Arf/p53 pathway. We demonstrate that Chd5 functions as a tumor suppressor in vivo and implicate deletion of CHD5 in human cancer. Identification of this tumor suppressor provides new avenues for exploring innovative clinical interventions for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2084293680,"Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) is the mechanism generally thought by which heterochromatin effects silencing. However, recent discovery in fission yeast of a cis-acting posttranscriptional gene-silencing (cis-PTGS) pathway operated by the RNAi machinery at heterochromatin challenges the role of TGS in heterochromatic silencing. Here, we describe a multienzyme effector complex (termed SHREC) that mediates heterochromatic TGS in fission yeast. SHREC consists of a core quartet of proteins—Clr1, Clr2, Clr3, and Mit1—which distribute throughout all major heterochromatin domains to effect TGS via distinct activities associated with the histone deacetylase Clr3 and the SNF2 chromatin-remodeling factor homolog Mit1. SHREC is also recruited to the telomeres by multiple independent mechanisms involving telomere binding protein Ccq1 cooperating with Taz1 and the RNAi machinery, and to euchromatic sites, via mechanism(s) distinct from its heterochromatin localization aided by Swi6/HP1. Our analyses suggest that SHREC regulates nucleosome positioning to assemble higher-order chromatin structures critical for heterochromatin functions.

Our analyses suggest that SHREC regulates nucleosome positioning to assemble higher-order chromatin structures critical for heterochromatin functions. Eukaryotic chromosomes are composed of two general types of chromatin domains: euchromatin, gene-rich chromatin that is accessible to factors involved in different aspects of DNA transactions including transcription, and heterochromatin, which is typically highly condensed and forms highly ordered nucleosomal arrays (Grewal and Elgin, 2002Grewal S.I.

Heterochromatin has a characteristic histone-modification profile distinguished by hypoacetylation of histones and methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me) (Grewal and Elgin, 2002Grewal S.I.

Deacetylation of histones appears to be a universal prerequisite for establishing repressive heterochromatin structures (Jenuwein and Allis, 2001Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Translating the histone code.Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7205) Google Scholar). Whereas heterochromatic islands are interspersed throughout the genomes, major targets of heterochromatin formation are chromosome regions that contain high density of repetitive elements such as transposons present at centromeres and telomeres (Hall and Grewal, 2003Hall I.M.

Heterochromatin not only silences underlying DNA sequences but also prohibits recombination, which is essential for protecting genome integrity. Moreover, defects in heterochromatin disrupt chromosome segregation and developmentally controlled long-range chromatin interactions (Jia et al., 2004bJia S. Yamada T. Grewal S.I.

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains large blocks of heterochromatin, and many factors involved in heterochromatin assembly in higher eukaryotes are also conserved in this system (Grewal and Elgin, 2002Grewal S.I.

RITS also interacts with RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RDRC) containing Rdrp1, whose catalytic activity is critical for siRNA generation and heterochromatin assembly (Motamedi et al., 2004Motamedi M.R.

USA. 2005; 102: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that RITS recruits RDRC and perhaps other RNAi factors to heterochromatic loci and, together, these factors process repeat transcripts into siRNAs. While recent studies have considerably illuminated the contribution of cis-PTGS to heterochromatic gene silencing, the mechanism of transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) and its relative contribution to silencing at heterochromatic loci in fission yeast is less understood. Our recent analysis revealed that the HDAC activity of Clr3 contributes to the silencing of a dg/dh-like element (cenH) located at the silent mat locus by regulating Pol II occupancy (Yamada et al., 2005Yamada T. Fischle W. Sugiyama T. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. The nucleation and maintenance of heterochromatin by a histone deacetylase in fission yeast.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Clr3 operates at the level of transcription and that Clr3 may be a part of an apparatus that enforces heterochromatic transcriptional silencing. In this study, we describe an effector complex involved in TGS in S. pombe. This complex termed SHREC (Snf2/Hdac-containing Repressor Complex) contains at least two distinct enzymatic functions: Clr3 HDAC and a novel factor named Mit1 belonging to the SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling factors. Other components include silencing factors, Clr1 and Clr2, which together with Clr3 and Mit1 constitute a core quartet of SHREC present across all heterochromatin domains. SHREC interacts with Ccq1, a telomere binding protein that along with Taz1 (a homolog of mammalian TRF1/2) acts in a parallel mechanism to the RNAi pathway to facilitate SHREC recruitment to the telomere ends. Whereas factors such as Swi6/HP1 provide a platform for stable binding and spreading of SHREC across heterochromatic domains, the core SHREC components also localize to euchromatic loci independent of Swi6. Our analyses suggest that the enzymatic activities associated with Clr3 and Mit1 are critical for proper positioning of nucleosomes at heterochromatic loci and for TGS function of SHREC and that SHREC acts to restrict Pol II occupancy at heterochromatic repeats. To gain insights into the function of Clr3 in TGS, we purified Clr3 from a strain expressing Clr3 tagged at its carboxyl terminus with triple FLAG epitopes (Clr3-FLAG). Clr3-FLAG is fully functional (Figures 1A and 1B). Analysis of the Clr3-purified fraction revealed several polypeptides, ranging in sizes from 65 to 170 kDa, which were present in immunoaffinity-purified fraction of Clr3-FLAG but not in that of the control (Figure 1C). Mass spectrometry analyses identified the 80 kDa polypeptide as Clr3-FLAG, and the 140 and 65 kDa polypeptides respectively as Clr1, a C2H2-type zinc finger protein, and Clr2, a protein with no obvious conserved domain (Figures 1C and S1) (Bjerling et al., 2004Bjerling P. Ekwall K. Egel R. Thon G. A novel type of silencing factor, Clr2, is necessary for transcriptional silencing at various chromosomal locations in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4421-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Clr1, Clr2, and Clr3 were identified in screens for factors required for heterochromatic silencing at the mat locus (Ekwall and Ruusala, 1994Ekwall K. Ruusala T.

Klar A.J. The clr1 locus regulates the expression of the cryptic mating-type loci of fission yeast.Genetics. 1992; 131: 287-296PubMed Google Scholar), and previous genetic evidence indicates that Clr1 and Clr3 may function jointly in the same pathway (Grewal et al., 1998Grewal S.I. Bonaduce M.J. Klar A.J. Histone deacetylase homologs regulate epigenetic inheritance of transcriptional silencing and chromosome segregation in fission yeast.Genetics. 1998; 150: 563-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We identified the 90 and 170 kDa bands as Ccq1 and SPBP35G2.10, respectively. Ccq1 contains a HEAT repeat and a coiled-coil domain and has been implicated in linking telomeres to the spindle-pole body (Flory et al., 2004Flory M.R. Carson A.R. Muller E.G. Aebersold R. An SMC-domain protein in fission yeast links telomeres to the meiotic centrosome.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 619-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We named SPBP35G2.10 as Mit1 (Mi2-like protein interacting with Clr three 1) due to its high similarity to Mi-2/CHD3 proteins, in possessing PHD finger, SNF2_N helicase and helicase C-terminal domains commonly found in SNF2 family chromatin remodeling factors. However, unlike its orthologs, Mit1 lacks a chromodomain (Figure 1). To confirm that the proteins identified in the Clr3-purified fraction stably associate with Clr3, we constructed strains expressing epitope-tagged versions of these proteins. In strains carrying Clr1-myc, V5-Clr2, Mit1-myc, or Ccq1-GFP, we observed the expected size for each protein, and silencing assay showed that none of these tagged proteins displayed defect in centromeric or telomeric silencing (Figure S2), indicating that the tagged proteins are functional. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments and found that Clr3 coimmunoprecipitated with Clr1, Clr2, Mit1, and Ccq1 (Figure 1D). These analyses indicate that factors mentioned above form a complex with Clr3 in vivo. Clr3 is known to localize to centromeres and the mat locus (Wiren et al., 2005Wiren M. Silverstein R.A. Sinha I.

Cell. 2005; 20: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, genome-wide studies implicate a global transcriptional regulatory role for Clr3 (Hansen et al., 2005Hansen K.R. Burns G. Mata J. Volpe T.A. Martienssen R.A. Bahler J. Thon G. Global effects on gene expression in fission yeast by silencing and RNA interference machineries.Mol. Cell.

Genomewide analysis of nucleosome density histone acetylation and HDAC function in fission yeast.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2906-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To identify the global targets of SHREC and determine its mode of recruitment, we utilized ChIP-chip analyses to map at high resolution all SHREC components across the S. pombe genome. We found prominent binding peaks of Mit1, Clr1, Clr2, and Clr3 associated with major heterochromatin domains including centromeres, subtelomeres, rDNA, and the mat locus, while those of Ccq1 were restricted to telomeres (Figure 2). Detailed examination of the major heterochromatic regions revealed the ubiquitous presence of SHREC components throughout the entire heterochromatic domains (Figure 3A). In particular, the binding profiles of SHREC components at centromeres, subtelomeres, and the mat locus are highly similar to H3K9me2 and Swi6 distributions reported previously (Cam et al., 2005Cam H.P. Sugiyama T. Chen E.S. Chen X. FitzGerald P.C. Grewal S.I. Comprehensive analysis of heterochromatin- and RNAi-mediated epigenetic control of the fission yeast genome.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), except Clr2, which is also enriched at the central core (cnt) domain of centromeres, regions devoid of H3K9me2 and Swi6 (Figure 3A). This result suggests that in addition to their roles at heterochromatin, SHREC components, notably Clr2, might have a role in chromatin organization at the cnt domain, the site of kinetochore assembly.Figure 3SHREC Localizes to Both Heterochromatic and Euchromatic LociShow full caption(A and B) Distributions of SHREC components at major heterochromatic domains (A) and at euchromatic loci (B). Conventional ChIP analyses of Mit1, Clr1, Clr2, Clr3, and Ccq1 at different loci were performed to confirm results from ChIP-chip experiments. DNA isolated from chromatin-immunoprecipitated (ChIP) or whole-cell extract (WCE) fractions were analyzed by multiplex PCR with primers designed to amplify SHREC target sequences and the act1 or tRNA controls.

SHREC also localizes to a number of euchromatic sites (Figures 2 and 3B). These sites include protein-coding genes, noncoding RNAs, and intergenic regions. Additionally, SHREC associates with Tf2 retrotransposons and some solo LTRs sequences that are believed to be packaged into repressive chromatin (Hansen et al., 2005Hansen K.R. Burns G. Mata J. Volpe T.A. Martienssen R.A. Bahler J. Thon G. Global effects on gene expression in fission yeast by silencing and RNA interference machineries.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 590-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We noticed that some SHREC components, in particular Clr3, localize to several sites seemingly unaccompanied by other components, which might reflect the dynamic nature of SHREC, or that these components can act independently in certain chromosomal contexts. However, the consistent colocalization patterns at most genomic locations among the four SHREC components, namely Clr1, Clr2, Clr3, and Mit1, but not Ccq1 due to its restricted binding profile at the chromosomal end regions, further support the notion that these proteins may constitute the core quartet of SHREC and that Ccq1, similar to Atf1/Pcr1 required for targeting Clr3 to a nucleation site at the mat locus (Yamada et al., 2005Yamada T. Fischle W. Sugiyama T. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. The nucleation and maintenance of heterochromatin by a histone deacetylase in fission yeast.Mol.

Fission yeast employs at least two pathways to maintain gene silencing at telomeres: Taz1, a telomere binding protein, and RNAi machinery that acts through dh repeat-like sequences embedded within subtelomeric regions (Cooper et al., 1997Cooper J.P.

Alternatively, we demonstrate that fluorine (19F) MRI of cells labeled with different types of liquid perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoparticles produces unique and sensitive cell markers distinct from any tissue background signal. To define the utility for cell tracking, mononuclear cells harvested from human umbilical cord blood were grown under proendothelial conditions and labeled with nanoparticles composed of two distinct PFC cores (perfluorooctylbromide and perfluoro-15-crown-5 ether). The sensitivity for detecting and imaging labeled cells was defined on 11.7T (research) and 1.5T (clinical) scanners. Stem/progenitor cells (CD34+ CD133+ CD31+) readily internalized PFC nanoparticles without aid of adjunctive labeling techniques, and cells remained functional in vivo. PFC-labeled cells exhibited distinct 19F signals and were readily detected after both local and intravenous injection. PFC nanoparticles provide an unequivocal and unique signature for stem/progenitor cells, enable spatial cell localization with 19F MRI, and permit quantification and detection of multiple fluorine signatures via 19F MR spectroscopy. This method should facilitate longitudinal investigation of cellular events in vivo for multiple cell types simultaneously."

Among them, the Flaviviruses dengue (DENV) and West Nile (WNV) cause regular outbreaks with fatal outcomes.

In this study, crystal structures of enzymatically active and inactive WNV RdRp domains were determined at 3.0- and 2.35-Å resolution, respectively. The determined structures were shown to be mostly similar to the RdRps of the Flaviviridae members hepatitis C and bovine viral diarrhea virus, although with unique elements characteristic for the WNV RdRp. Using a reverse genetic system, residues involved in putative interactions between the RNA-cap methyltransferase (MTase) and the RdRp domain of Flavivirus NS5 were identified. This allowed us to propose a model for the structure of the full-length WNV NS5 by in silico docking of the WNV MTase domain (modeled from our previously determined structure of the DENV MTase domain) onto the RdRp domain.

WNV epidemics in the United States have resulted in a total of 23,925 cases of human disease and 946 deaths reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) from 1999 to 2006. WNV consists of 2 lineages (I and II). The North American WNV isolates belong to lineage I, which also includes the Australian subtype Kunjin (3Scherret J.H. Poidinger M. Mackenzie J.S. Broom A.K. Deubel V. Lipkin W.I. Briese T. Gould E.A. Hall R.A. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2001; 7: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In contrast to other lineage I WNV strains (4Lanciotti R.S. Ebel G.D. Deubel V. Kerst A.J. Murri S. Meyer R. Bowen M. McKinney N. Morrill W.E. Crabtree M.B. Kramer L.D. Roehrig J.T. Virology. 2002; 298: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), infections with the Kunjin subtype of WNV do not cause fatal disease in humans (5Hall R.A. Broom A.K. Smith D.W. Mackenzie J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 267: 253-269PubMed Google Scholar). The Flavivirus positive sense RNA genome contains a single open reading frame encoding a polyprotein that is processed into three structural and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). Signature-sequence analysis suggests that the non-structural protein NS5 is comprised of two domains. The DENV NS5 30-kDa N-terminal domain has been shown to possess RNA cap (nucleoside-2′-O) methyltransferase (MTase) activity, and its crystal structure has been determined (6Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). That of WNV has been shown to mediate both (guanine-N7) and (nucleoside-2′-O) methylation of the 5′-cap structure (7Ray D. Shah A. Tilgner M. Guo Y. Zhao Y. Dong H. Deas T.S. Zhou Y. Li H. Shi P.Y. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 8362-8370Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of about 70 kDa harbors the RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), as initially identified by the presence of signature-sequence motifs A to F (8O'Reilly E.K. Kao C.C.

The RdRp duplicates the single-stranded RNA genome during a single, continuous polymerization event. The RdRp enters at the 3′-end of the genome and is able to copy the whole RNA molecule in a primer-independent fashion (12Selisko B. Dutartre H. Guillemot J.C. Debarnot C. Benarroch D. Khromykh A.

Very little is known about the mechanism of flaviviral RNA capping, or its co-ordination with RNA synthesis. In eukaryotic cells, mRNA capping is a nuclear event, whereas Flavivirus RNA synthesis is thought to occur in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. The viral NS3 and NS5 proteins have been demonstrated to possess RNA-triphosphatase and 2′-O-/N7-MTase activities, respectively (6Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B.

Interestingly, during infection, a proportion of the NS5 and, more recently, of the NS3 protein of a number of flaviviruses has been detected in the nucleus (DENV) or at least the perinuclear region (WNV and Japanese encephalitis virus) of infected cells (27Buckley A. Gaidamovich S. Turchinskaya A. Gould E.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Kapoor M. Zhang L. Ramachandra M. Kusukawa J. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J.

Virol. 2006; 80: 5451-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Trafficking of the DENV NS5 to the nucleus was proposed to rely on a nuclear import pathway based on the identification of functional nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) in NS5 and their interaction in vitro with distinct members of the karyopherin family of intracellular transport proteins (karyopherin-α/β, also known as importin-α/β or Impα/β) (30Johansson M. Brooks A.J. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Brooks A.J. Johansson M. John A.V. Xu Y. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36399-36407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). NLSs are small motifs composed of one or more clusters of basic amino acids that do not conform to a specific sequence consensus. Two adjacent regions encompassing distinct NLSs have been defined in DENV NS5 termed the bNLS (aa 320 to 368) and the a/bNLS (aa 369 to 405) (30Johansson M. Brooks A.J. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Brooks A.J. Johansson M. John A.V. Xu Y. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36399-36407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The bNLS and a/bNLS bind with high affinity to Impβ and an Impα/β heterodimer in vitro, respectively, and both are capable of targeting β-galactosidase to the nucleus in the context of a fusion protein (30Johansson M. Brooks A.J. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Brooks A.J. Johansson M. John A.V. Xu Y. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36399-36407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, whether the bNLS and a/bNLS are required for nuclear import of the intact NS5 protein during viral infection is not known. The bNLS of DENV NS5 has also been shown to interact with NS3 and competition between Impβ and NS3 binding has been confirmed using pulldown assays (30Johansson M. Brooks A.J. Jans D.A. Vasudevan S.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Here, we report the crystal structures of enzymatically active and inactive WNV RdRp domains. They reveal a classic RdRp fold bearing palm, thumb, and finger domains decorated with Flavivirus-specific attributes such as a priming loop adopting a different fold. Structural elements in the WNV RdRp structure corresponding to putative DENV NLSs were found to be integral parts of the RdRp domain. Interestingly, despite sequence conservation in the NLSs of DENV and WNV NS5 the latter was not found to localize to the nucleus. To gain insight into the overall spatial organization of the full-length NS5 protein, a reverse genetic approach was used to identify amino acids in the DENV MTase and RdRp domains, which potentially interact and could be used to position one domain relative to the other. The structure of the WNV MTase domain was modeled using DENV MTase atomic coordinates. Both WNV MTase and RdRp domains were assembled in silico using docking procedures, generating a model of full-length WNV NS5 protein. Expression and Purification of the Polymerase Domains—Three WNV strain Kunjin ns5 gene constructs encoding a N-terminal His6 tag fused to pol1 (corresponding to aa 273-905), pol2 (corresponding to aa 317-905), or pol3 (corresponding to aa 273 to 882) open reading frames were cloned into the pDEST14 vector, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The proteins were expressed and purified to homogeneity as follows: the E. coli strain C41pRos, transformed with either plasmid construct, was grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and further incubated 16-18 h at 17 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, DNase I (2 μg/ml), a protease inhibitor tablet (Sigma), and sonicated on ice. The sample was centrifuged, the supernatant collected and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. The sample was applied to a 5-ml bed volume HiTrap nickel immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 500 mm imidazole. Protein-containing fractions were then applied onto a preparative Superdex 200 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 9.0, with 300 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol. Protein was concentrated to 6 (POL1) and 9 mg/ml (POL2 and POL3) using a Vivaspin 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off centrifugal concentrator (Vivascience). A selenomethionine-substituted protein was used for structure determination. It was expressed according to standard conditions of the methionine-biosynthesis pathway inhibition (32Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) and purified following the same procedure as that for the native protein. Crystallization—Initial crystallization trials were set up with a nano-drop dispenser in 96-well sitting drop plates using commercial crystallization kits and purified protein at 6 mg/ml for POL1 and 9 mg/ml for POL2. Initial hits were further optimized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in Linbro plates by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals of POL1 were grown from 10% PEG 1000, 0.2 m sodium cacodylate, 0.3 m MgCl2, pH 7.0. POL2 was crystallized using two conditions (i) 5% PEG 10,000, 0.2 m imidazole malate, pH 8.0, and (ii) 10% PEG 8000, 0.1 m imidazole pH 7.0, and 0.2 m calcium acetate. Crystals were briefly soaked in a cryo-protectant solution composed of mother liquor supplemented with 36% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. WNV POL1 and POL2 diffraction intensities were recorded on different beamlines (Table 1) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Integration, scaling, and merging of the intensities were carried out using programs from the CCP4 suite (33Collaborative Computational Project, NActa Crystallogr. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The structure of WNV POL2 was solved using single wavelength anomalous dispersion data collected at the peak of the selenium absorption edge from a selenomethionine-derivatized crystal. Location of 16 selenium atoms (of the 21 expected) was performed using SHELXD (34Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). Phases and figures of merit were calculated using SHELXE (35Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and SHARP (36Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Density modification was performed using RESOLVE (37Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and SHARP. About 40% of the model was built in an automatic fashion with RESOLVE and completed manually using COOT (38Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23012) Google Scholar), with the RdRp structures of HCV and BVDV as guides for connectivity (Protein Data Bank codes 1NB6 and 1S49). The model was refined against two data sets using REFMAC (39Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar): the first, which extends to 2.5-Å resolution, was called “native” as it contains no ion near the active site. The second extends to 2.35-Å resolution and was called “calcium” as a calcium ion was found in a non-catalytic position near the active site (Table 1). The calcium resulting model was subsequently used to solve the structure of POL1 by the molecular replacement method using AMORE (40Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Refinement of POL1 was initially performed using simulated annealing as implemented in CNS (41Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar) at 3.0-Å resolution (Table 1). Electron density corresponding to the extra 44 N-terminal amino acids of POL1 (compared with POL2) and to some disordered loops of POL2 became visible. Attempts to model the missing parts were performed using several rounds of manual building and refinement using CNS (41Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar). BUSTER-TNT (42Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Lea S.M. Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2210-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) was then used, and allowed further completion of the model, particularly for residues 363-367, for which no density had previously been visible. Finally, POL1 was refined using BUSTER-TNT under harmonic restraints to much of the POL2 calcium structure, to avoid “un-refinement” of the POL2 substructure against the lower-resolution POL1 data as detailed in “Supplemental Material.” The R-factors and geometry were improved by this harmonically restrained refinement. Refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. RdRp Activity Tests—RdRp activity tests were performed in 50-μl reactions containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GTP (0.01 μCi of [3H]GTP per μl, 6.1 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) using 1 μm poly(rC) (Amersham Biosciences) and WNV RdRp (264 nm POL1, 760 nm POL2, and 800 nm POL3). Reactions were started with a premix of MnCl2, MgCl2, and GTP and incubated at 30 °C. Samples of 12 μl were taken after 5, 10, and/or 15 min and the reaction stopped by adding 30 μl of 50 mm EDTA in 96-well plates. Samples were then transferred to glass fiber filter mats with DEAE active groups (DEAE filter mat, Wallac) using a Filtermat Harvester (Packard Instruments). Filtermats were washed three times with 0.3 m ammonium formate, pH 8.0, twice with water, once with ethanol, dried, and the filter transferred into sample bags. Liquid scin-fluid fluid was added and incorporation was measured in counts per minute using a Wallac MicroBeta TriLux Liquid Scintillation Counter. Introduction of NS5 Mutations into a Genomic Length DENV cDNA Clone—Mutations encoding changes in NS5 amino acids were introduced into the genomic length DENV serotype 2 strain New Guinea C (DENV-2) cDNA clone pDVWS601, which yields the virus v601 (43Gualano R.C. Pryor M.J. Cauchi M.R. Wright P.J. Davidson A.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 44Pryor M.J. Gualano R.C. Lin B. Davidson A.D. Wright P.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2631-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutations were initially introduced into subgenomic PCR fragments by overlap extension PCR using mutagenic primers (details available from the authors upon request) and then transferred into pDVWS601 as follows. The mutation K46A/R47A/E49A (each NS5 amino acid targeted for mutagenesis is numbered followed by the substituted amino acid) was engineered into a 1001-bp overlap extension PCR fragment (DENV-2 nucleotides 7165-8165), which was HpaI7406/StuI7874 digested and introduced into the corresponding sites of pDVWS601 to produce pDVWS601-NS5K46A,R47A,E49A. The NS5 mutation L512V was engineered into a 2077-bp fragment (DENV-2 nucleotides 8085-10161), which was AatII8570/MluI9732 digested and introduced into the corresponding sites of pDVWS601 and pDVWS601-NS5K46A,R47A,E49A to produce pDVWS601-NS5L512V and pDVWS601-NS5K46A,R47A,E49A,L512V, respectively. Recombinant DENV Recovery, Growth, and Sequencing—Procedures for the recovery of infectious DENV-2 from pDVWS601 including transcription of RNA, electroporation of BHK-21 cells, and passaging and plaque assay of virus in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells have been described previously (43Gualano R.C.

Virol. 1998; 79: 2631-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Confirmation of the mutations in the recovered viruses and the identification of second site mutations were performed by sequencing the entire DENV-2 genome. Viral RNA was extracted from the culture supernatants of infected cells using a QIAamp Viral RNA Extraction kit (Qiagen) and used for the production of six overlapping 2-kilobase pair RT-PCR products spanning the DENV-2 genome using DENV-2-specific primers and the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq System (Invitrogen). Each RT-PCR product was then purified using a Qiagen PCR Purification Kit and used for automated DNA sequencing using DENV-2-specific primers. Molecular Modeling and Docking—Alignment of the MTase sequences of DENV-2 (PDB code 1L9K) and WNV was performed using SPDBV (45Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

The density, x, of the sodium in the intercalation layers can be altered electrochemically, directly changing the number of conduction electrons on triangular Co layers. Recent electron diffraction measurements reveal a kaleidoscope of Na+ ion patterns as a function of concentration. Here we use single-crystal neutron diffraction supported by numerical simulations to determine the long-range three-dimensional superstructures of these ions. We show that the sodium ordering and its associated distortion field are governed by pure electrostatics, and the organizational principle is the stabilization of charge droplets that order long range at some simple fractional fillings. Our results provide a good starting point to understand the electronic properties in terms of a Hubbard Hamiltonian taking into account the electrostatic potential from the Na superstructures. The resulting depth of potential wells in the Co layer is greater than the single-particle hopping kinetic energy. As a consequence, holes occupy preferentially the lowest potential regions and, therefore, the Na+ ion patterning plays a decisive role in the transport and magnetic properties."

https://openalex.org/W2117026649,"The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a central regulator of the energy status of the cell, based on its unique ability to respond directly to fluctuations in the ratio of AMP:ATP. Because glucose and amino acids stimulate insulin release from pancreatic β-cells by the regulation of metabolic intermediates, AMPK represents an attractive candidate for control of β-cell function. Here, we show that inhibition of AMPK in β-cells by high glucose inversely correlates with activation of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, another cellular sensor for nutritional conditions. Forced activation of AMPK by AICAR, phenformin, or oligomycin significantly blocked phosphorylation of p70S6K, a downstream target of mTOR, in response to the combination of glucose and amino acids. Amino acids also suppressed the activity of AMPK, and this at a minimum required the presence of leucine and glutamine. It is unlikely that the ability of AMPK to sense both glucose and amino acids plays a role in regulation of insulin secretion, as inhibition of AMPK by amino acids did not influence insulin secretion. Moreover, activation of AMPK by AICAR or phenformin did not antagonize glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and insulin secretion was also unaffected in response to suppression of AMPK activity by expression of a dominant negative AMPK construct (K45R). Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of AMPK activity by glucose and amino acids might be an important component of the mechanism for nutrient-stimulated mTOR activity but not insulin secretion in the β-cell.

Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of AMPK activity by glucose and amino acids might be an important component of the mechanism for nutrient-stimulated mTOR activity but not insulin secretion in the β-cell. The β-cell is unique compared with other mammalian cell types in that its primary function to synthesize and secrete insulin is tightly coupled to its metabolic rate. Glucose is the most potent nutrient in stimulating insulin release. Upon entry into the β-cell, glucose is rapidly metabolized, resulting in the generation of mitochondria-derived metabolic intermediates including ATP. This increase in ATP leads to closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP)-channels, depolarization of the plasma membrane and opening of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels. The subsequent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i triggers insulin exocytosis (1Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). The β-cell also utilizes certain key amino acids that, via mitochondrial metabolism, can further generate coupling factors that elicit an insulin secretory response (2MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A.

Substrate Control of Insulin Release. Oxford University Press, 2001: 125-151Google Scholar). In addition to their role as insulin secretagogues, glucose and other nutrients stimulate protein translation and β-cell growth and proliferation (4Hugl S.R. White M.F. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17771-17779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 5Swenne I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). While much is known regarding how the β-cell couples glucose metabolism to insulin secretion, the mechanisms by which β-cells sense metabolism of other fuels, such as amino acids, and augment glucose-stimulated insulin release are less clear. Further, it is unclear how the β-cell coordinates nutrient abundance with enhanced protein translation and cell growth. This aspect of β-cell function is particularly important under conditions of increased insulin demand, such as obesity and/or insulin resistance. Failure of β-cells to compensate for this increase in demand is a critical factor in the development of type 2 diabetes (6Ahren B. Curr. Mol. Med. 2005; 5: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 2The abbreviations used are: AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside; BCH, β-(+/-)-2-aminobicyclo-(2.2.1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase. is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated by various pathological and physiological stresses that result in a lowered cellular ATP/ADP + AMP ratio (7Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 8Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The AMPK protein complex consists of a catalytic α-subunit and regulatory β- and γ-subunits. AMPK activity is regulated allosterically by AMP and through phosphorylation at Thr172 in the activation loop of the α-subunit. By phosphorylation of downstream targets, AMPK acts to repress pathways that consume energy and to promote ATP-producing catabolic pathways (7Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 8Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). For example, by phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, AMPK shuts down the ATP-depleting processes of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, respectively, and replenishes ATP by promoting fatty acid oxidation. AMPK also exerts its effect on cellular energy balance through modification of gene expression and protein translation (9Inoki K. Ouyang H. Li Y. Guan K.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 79-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 10Rutter G.A. Da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Because glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from the β-cell is directly tied to the generation of metabolic intermediates, the unique sensitivity of AMPK to changes in the AMP/ATP ratio makes AMPK an attractive candidate for regulation of β-cell function. Indeed, AMPK has been implicated in the regulation of glucose and amino acid-stimulated insulin release and gene expression in the β-cell, although this is controversial (11da Silva Xavier G.

Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 1798-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More recently, the ability of AMPK to coordinate energy availability with protein synthesis through regulation of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has received considerable attention in non-β-cell lines (9Inoki K. Ouyang H. Li Y. Guan K.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 79-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Currently, it is not known if AMPK modulates the mTOR signaling pathway similarly in the β-cell. AMPK regulates protein translation via at least two mechanisms: phosphorylation and activation of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) and inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway (14Browne G.J. Finn S.G. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12220-12231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 15Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). Activation of eEF2K leads to phosphorylation of its target eEF2 and inhibition of the elongation step of protein translation. mTOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates various cellular functions, in particular, the initiation step of protein synthesis. mTOR is activated in response to hormones and growth factors, such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway in the presence of amino acids. Amino acids also induce mTOR activity in the absence of additional stimuli. In particular, the branch-chained amino acid leucine is required for the effect of amino acids to activate mTOR. Once activated, mTOR phosphorylates both the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), an inhibitor of translation, and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) (15Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). Because AMPK may represent an alternative mechanism for sensing glucose and amino acids in the β-cell, it is important to understand its downstream targets in this cell type. Moreover, the ongoing development of activators of AMPK for use as drugs in the treatment of type 2 diabetes makes this a particularly relevant issue. In this study, we asked if AMPK regulates glucose-stimulated mTOR activation and insulin secretion in β-cells lines and primary rodent islets. Because amino acids contribute to both stimulation of insulin release and mTOR activation through their metabolic breakdown, we also addressed the question of how amino acids are sensed by AMPK and whether their effect to inhibit AMPK correlates with insulin release.

Glucose stimulates phosphorylation of p70S6K in MIN6 cells (23Gomez E. Powell M.L. Greenman I.C. Herbert T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53937-53946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the relative contributions of a direct effect of glucose as opposed to the potential autocrine effects of secreted insulin on mTOR activity have not been determined. Therefore, we first examined glucose-stimulated mTOR activity in MIN6 cells and determined what component of that stimulation was caused by glucose alone. MIN6 cells were starved of serum, glucose, and amino acids for 2 h followed by exposure to glucose at increasing concentrations for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 1, glucose in the presence of a 1× concentration of amino acids dose-dependently increased p70S6K phosphorylation with maximal stimulation at 30 mm glucose. The 1× amino acid mixture contains a complete complement of amino acids plus glutamine (2 mm) and is equivalent to the concentration of amino acids present in MEMα medium. Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), the downstream target of p70S6K, correlates with p70S6K activation. To determine what portion of the glucose-stimulated mTOR activity is directly caused by glucose, MIN6 cells were treated with either diazoxide or verapamil, which block insulin release by inhibiting the influx of extracellular Ca2+. Diazoxide binds to the KATP-channel maintaining it in an open conformation whereas verapamil acts directly on the Ca2+ channel to block Ca2+ influx (24Doyle M.E. Egan J.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 105-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Both drugs completely inhibited insulin release from cells stimulated with 30 mm glucose and almost completely eliminated glucose-mediated p70S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Exposure of vehicle-treated MIN6 cells to 30 mm glucose resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in p70S6K phosphorylation compared with 3 mm glucose (Fig. 2, B and C). In cells treated with diazoxide, p70S6K phosphorylation was completely abrogated with no significant difference between the 3 and 30 mm glucose treatments (Fig. 2, B and C). However, although verapamil blocked glucose-stimulated insulin release, the mobility shift in p70S6K induced by glucose was not completely inhibited. These results suggest that whereas most of the mTOR response to glucose is probably mediated by released insulin a small, direct effect of glucose may exist.FIGURE 2A portion of glucose-stimulated mTOR activity is independent of insulin secretion. MIN6 cells were serum, glucose, and amino acid starved in KRBH for 2 h. Diazoxide (100 μm) or verapamil (100 μm) was added during the last hour of preincubation. Cells were then stimulated for 30 min with KRBH containing the indicated glucose concentration in the presence of vehicle (dimethyl sulfate), diazoxide, or verapamil.

Therefore, we next asked if stimulating MIN6 cells with glucose in the presence of a saturating concentration of insulin (200 nm) would allow us to discern specifically the direct effect of glucose on activation of the mTOR pathway. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, increasing the glucose concentration from 3 to 30 mm enhances both p70S6K and rpS6 phosphorylation. The effect of added insulin was indicated by an increase in phosphorylation at serine 473 (Ser473) of Akt, a kinase known to be downstream of the insulin receptor (Fig. 3). In the presence of 200 nm insulin, Akt phosphorylation was maximal and did not increase further with the addition of glucose, indicating that activation of the insulin receptor was saturating. However, in the presence of saturating insulin, increasing the glucose concentration resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of p70S6K and rpS6 (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate the presence of a direct (i.e. without intervening insulin secretion) effect of glucose on mTOR that can be assessed by analysis in the presence of a saturating concentration of insulin. We next asked whether a reduction in AMPK signaling mediates glucose-stimulated activation of the mTOR pathway in the β-cell. MIN6 cells, preincubated as described previously, were exposed to 3 or 30 mm glucose plus 200 nm insulin with or without a 1× amino acid mixture for 30 min. During the 30 min of stimulation, AICAR, phenformin, or oligomycin was added as indicated to activate AMPK (Fig. 4). The drugs chosen to activate AMPK do so via three distinct mechanisms. AICAR is phosphorylated inside the cell to the AMP analogue, ZMP. Phenformin is a biguanide widely used to treat type 2 diabetes. Its method of AMPK activation is unclear but seems to be dependent on changes in the AMP:ATP ratio (25Owen M.R. Doran E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Lastly, oligomycin depletes cellular ATP by inhibiting mitochondrial ATP synthase. Three surrogate measures of cellular AMPK activity were employed: phosphorylation on threonine 172 of the catalytic subunit; and phosphorylation of its two substrates ACC and eEF2. As expected, pharmacological activation of AMPK led to an increase in these parameters, though the three drugs differed in their relative potencies (Fig. 4A). Again, as anticipated, incubation in a low concentration of glucose also led to activation of AMPK. Surprisingly however, amino acids completely suppressed the activation of AMPK by glucose depletion. This effect was overcome by exposure of cells to pharmacological activators of AMPK (Fig. 4A). Amino acids not only suppressed AMPK activity, but also activated mTOR signaling, as indicated by increases in phosphorylation of p70S6K and rpS6. AICAR, phenformin or oligomycin antagonized this activation of mTOR and their potencies paralleled their abilities to stimulate AMPK phosphorylation. Activation of AMPK by AICAR partially blocked the phosphorylation of p70S6k and rpS6 at both 3 and 30 mm glucose, whereas phosphorylation of these proteins was completely blocked by oligomycin or phenformin. The ability of three independent activators of AMPK to inhibit mTOR signaling suggests that the latter is a result of AMPK activation. Amino acids play an important role in regulating initiation of translation in addition to their function as precursors for protein synthesis (26Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 27Kimball S.R. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The presence of amino acids, in particular, leucine, is essential for activation of mTOR in response to glucose or insulin. Also, amino acid mixtures as well as certain individual amino acids can stimulate insulin release from the β-cell. The effect of amino acids to stimulate both initiation of protein synthesis via mTOR activation and insulin release has been attributed in part to their mitochondrial metabolism and an increase in cellular ATP level (2MacDonald M.J.

As shown in Fig. 4, we observed that the addition of amino acids to the media substantially reduced the effect of glucose to inhibit phosphorylation of AMPK and AMPK targets. As shown in Fig. 5A, MIN6 cells treated with either 0.25× or 1× amino acids for 30 min following a 2-h period of serum, glucose, and amino acid starvation, exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in AMPK phosphorylation as well as phosphor"

We find that the Aurora B kinase Ipl1 regulates kinetochore-microtubule attachment during both meiotic divisions and that a complex known as the monopolin complex ensures that the protein kinase coorients sister chromatids during meiosis I. Furthermore, the defining of conditions sufficient to induce sister kinetochore coorientation during mitosis provides insight into monopolin complex function. The monopolin complex joins sister kinetochores independently of cohesins, the proteins that hold sister chromatids together. We propose that this function of the monopolin complex helps Aurora B coorient sister chromatids during meiosis I. Kinetochores of sister chromatids attach to microtubules emanating from the same pole (coorientation) during meiosis I and microtubules emanating from opposite poles (biorientation) during meiosis II. We find that the Aurora B kinase Ipl1 regulates kinetochore-microtubule attachment during both meiotic divisions and that a complex known as the monopolin complex ensures that the protein kinase coorients sister chromatids during meiosis I.

The monopolin complex joins sister kinetochores independently of cohesins, the proteins that hold sister chromatids together. We propose that this function of the monopolin complex helps Aurora B coorient sister chromatids during meiosis I. The mitotic cell-division cycle is an alternation of chromosome duplication and segregation. During meiotic cell division, which generates gametes, DNA replication is followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation. During the first division, meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate away from each other. During the second division, meiosis II, sister chromatids separate. Central to accurate chromosome segregation is the correct attachment of chromosomes to the spindle apparatus. During mitosis and meiosis II, sister kinetochores attach to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles (biorientation). In meiosis I, when homologs segregate away from each other and hence are bioriented, sister chromatids segregate to the same spindle pole. Thus, sister kinetochores must attach to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole, a phenomenon known as monopolar attachment or sister kinetochore coorientation. In budding yeast, sister kinetochore coorientation during meiosis I is brought about by the monopolin complex (reviewed in Marston and Amon, 2004Marston A.L. Amon A. Meiosis: cell-cycle controls shuffle and deal.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 983-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Cells lacking components of this complex biorient sister kinetochores during meiosis I and attempt to separate sister chromatids during the first meiotic division (Rabitsch et al., 2003Rabitsch K.P.

To date, four components of the monopolin complex have been identified. Mam1 is a meiosis-specific protein present at kinetochores from pachytene to metaphase I (Toth et al., 2000Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Buonomo S.B. Nasmyth K.

The monopolin complex components Csm1 and Lrs4 are expressed during both mitosis and meiosis. They reside in the nucleolus until G2, when they are released by the Polo kinase Cdc5 (Clyne et al., 2003Clyne R.K. Katis V.L. Jessop L. Benjamin K.R. Herskowitz I. Lichten M. Nasmyth K.

After their release, Csm1 and Lrs4 form a complex with Mam1 and bind to kinetochores (Rabitsch et al., 2003Rabitsch K.P. Petronczki M. Javerzat J.P. Genier S. Chwalla B. Schleiffer A. Tanaka T.U.

In addition, Mam1 recruits the ubiquitously expressed casein kinase 1δ/ɛ Hrr25, which is also required for sister kinetochore coorientation, to kinetochores during meiosis I (Petronczki et al., 2006Petronczki M.

The meiosis-specific protein Spo13 is also necessary for kinetochore coorientation. In its absence, the monopolin complex initially associates with kinetochores but cannot be maintained there (Katis et al., 2004bKatis V.L. Matos J. Mori S. Shirahige K. Zachariae W. Nasmyth K.

How the monopolin complex and proteins that regulate its association with kinetochores bring about sister kinetochore coorientation is poorly understood. The protein kinase Aurora B is a key regulator of kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Aurora B (Ipl1 in yeast) forms a complex with INCENP (Sli15 in yeast), and this complex controls many aspects of chromosome segregation, including histone H3 phosphorylation (Hsu et al., 2000Hsu J.Y.

In budding-yeast mitosis, the Ipl1-Sli15 complex was shown to sever kinetochore-microtubule attachments that are not under tension by phosphorylating kinetochore components such as Dam1 (Cheeseman et al., 2002Cheeseman I.M.

Thereby, Ipl1 generates unattached kinetochores, which activates the spindle checkpoint. The spindle checkpoint inhibits an ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) or cyclosome (C; reviewed in Lew and Burke, 2003Lew D.J. Burke D.J. The spindle assembly and spindle position checkpoints.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 251-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), whose activity is essential for entry into anaphase through its role in promoting the degradation of securin (Pds1 in yeast). This degradation leads to activation of a protease known as separase (Esp1 in yeast). Once active, separase cleaves a component of cohesin complexes, which hold sister chromatids together. A role for Aurora B in regulating kinetochore-microtubule attachment during meiosis has not been demonstrated. Here we investigate how Ipl1 and the monopolin complex regulate sister kinetochore orientation during meiosis. We find that Ipl1 is required for homolog biorientation during meiosis I as well as sister chromatid biorientation during meiosis II. Our data further show that Ipl1 is epistatic to the monopolin complex in the regulation of this process. Importantly, we find that an active monopolin complex is sufficient to promote sister kinetochore coorientation during mitosis. The ability to induce sister kinetochore coorientation during mitosis furthermore provides insight into one of the functions of the monopolin complex: it links sister kinetochores in a cohesin-independent manner. To examine the role of Ipl1 in yeast meiosis, we analyzed its protein levels and localization. Ipl1 was expressed throughout meiosis, but levels appeared lower as cells entered the meiotic cell cycle (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online; 0 time point). Ipl1 activity, as judged by histone H3 phosphorylation, mirrored Ipl1 protein levels (Figure S1A). The localization of Ipl1 in meiosis resembled that in mitosis (Figure S1B; Tanaka et al., 2002Tanaka T.U. Rachidi N. Janke C. Pereira G. Galova M. Schiebel E. Stark M.J. Nasmyth K.

Schiebel E. Separase regulates INCENP-Aurora B anaphase spindle function through Cdc14.Science. 2003; 302: 2120-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Ipl1 localized to the nucleus in metaphase I and metaphase II. During anaphase I and anaphase II, the protein was also found on the meiotic spindle. Analysis of Ipl1 on chromosome spreads revealed that, early in meiosis, Ipl1 is found on chromosomes but does not localize to kinetochores (data not shown). However, at metaphase I, Ipl1 associates with kinetochores as judged by the colocalization with the kinetochore component Ndc10 (Figure S1C). To determine Ipl1's function during meiosis, we placed the IPL1 open reading frame under the control of the SCC1/MCD1 promoter, which is largely repressed during meiosis (Michaelis et al., 1997Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cohesins: chromosomal proteins that prevent premature separation of sister chromatids.Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). This pSCC1-IPL1 fusion was expressed during the mitotic cell cycle (Figure 1A), but, because Ipl1 is unstable during G1 (Biggins et al., 1999Biggins S. Severin F.F. Bhalla N. Sassoon I. Hyman A.A. Murray A.W. The conserved protein kinase Ipl1 regulates microtubule binding to kinetochores in budding yeast.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), the protein was rapidly depleted from cells entering the meiotic cell cycle (Figure 1A). Cells carrying the pSCC1-IPL1 fusion as the sole source of Ipl1 did not exhibit proliferation defects during vegetative growth (data not shown), but progression through the meiotic cell cycle was affected. Cells exhibited a slight delay in entry into S phase (Figure 1B) and a moderate metaphase I and anaphase I delay, with spindles appearing thin and fragile (Figure 1C and data not shown). Despite these delays, 80% of cells eventually progressed through at least one meiotic division (Figure 1D). Similar results were obtained when Ipl1 was depleted by placing the IPL1 ORF under the control of the mitosis-specific CLB2 promoter (Figure S2 and data not shown). To follow the fate of chromosomes during the meiotic divisions in the absence of Ipl1, we integrated a tandem array of tetO sequences near the centromere of chromosome V on both homologs (homozygous CENV GFP dots). These cells also expressed a tetR-GFP fusion, which binds to tetO, to visualize the repeats (Michaelis et al., 1997Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cohesins: chromosomal proteins that prevent premature separation of sister chromatids.Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The analysis of homozygous GFP dots revealed that 80% of Ipl1-depleted cells segregated homologs to the same spindle pole rather than, as in wild-type cells, to opposite poles (Figures 1E and 1F). Similar results were obtained when we analyzed the chromosome segregation behavior of chromosome III or both chromosomes III and V (data not shown). This highly asymmetric chromosome segregation resulted in the two anaphase I DNA masses being of unequal size (data not shown). During mitosis, cells defective in IPL1 function preferentially segregate both sister chromatids with the old spindle pole body (SPB) into the bud (Pereira et al., 2001Pereira G. Tanaka T.U. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Modes of spindle pole body inheritance and segregation of the Bfa1p-Bub2p checkpoint protein complex.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6359-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, Tanaka et al., 2002Tanaka T.U. Rachidi N. Janke C. Pereira G. Galova M. Schiebel E. Stark M.J. Nasmyth K.

This is likely due to the fact that the duplication of kinetochore structures and subsequent microtubule capture occur prior to maturation of the newly synthesized SPB. Consequently, both sister chromatids attach to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole. Owing to the failure of cells lacking IPL1 to detach incorrect microtubule attachments, sister chromatids preferentially cosegregate with the old SPB into the bud. Consistent with this idea is the observation that the preferential cosegregation of sister chromatids with the old SPB can be partially rescued by transient microtubule depolymerization (Pereira et al., 2001Pereira G. Tanaka T.U. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Modes of spindle pole body inheritance and segregation of the Bfa1p-Bub2p checkpoint protein complex.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6359-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, Tanaka et al., 2002Tanaka T.U.

Transient treatment with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug benomyl during prophase I (4 hr after induction of meiosis) also partially rescued the cosegregation of homologs in Ipl1-depleted meiotic cells. Whereas 80% of homologs cosegregated to the same pole in mock-treated Ipl1-depleted cells, homolog segregation was nearly random (60% cosegregation and 40% separation) when cells were treated with benomyl (Figure 1F; note that the expected ratio for random segregation would be 50%:50%). Our results indicate that IPL1 is required for accurate homolog segregation during meiosis I. We propose that, as during mitosis, Ipl1 does so by promoting microtubule attachment turnover until all homologs are correctly oriented on the meiosis I spindle. To determine the role of Ipl1 in meiosis II chromosome segregation, we examined cells carrying the tetO array on only one of the two homologs (heterozygous CENV GFP dots). Ipl1-depleted cells showed normal segregation of heterozygous CENV GFP dots during the first meiotic division (i.e., the GFP signal was present in one of the two nuclei after the first meiotic division; Figure 2A, upper panels), indicating that sister chromatids did not separate prematurely during meiosis I. However, 60% of the cells that underwent a second meiotic division missegregated chromosomes, resulting in the generation of four nuclei of unequal size (Figure 2A, lower panels and data not shown). Because Ipl1-depleted cells undergo the second meiotic division with poor efficiency, we also examined Ipl1-depleted cells deleted for SPO11. SPO11 encodes the topoisomerase-like enzyme responsible for generating recombination-initiating double-strand breaks (Bergerat et al., 1997Bergerat A. de Massy B. Gadelle D. Varoutas P.C. Nicolas A. Forterre P. An atypical topoisomerase II from Archaea with implications for meiotic recombination.Nature. 1997; 386: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, Keeney et al., 1997Keeney S. Giroux C.N. Kleckner N. Meiosis-specific DNA double-strand breaks are catalyzed by Spo11, a member of a widely conserved protein family.Cell. 1997; 88: 375-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar), and deletion of SPO11 allowed Ipl1-depleted cells (as is the case in many other meiotic mutants) to progress through the second meiotic division more efficiently (compare Figure 1D and Figure 2B). Missegregation of sister chromatids was even more pronounced in Ipl1-depleted cells lacking SPO11: eighty percent of sister chromatids segregated to the same pole during the second meiotic division (Figure 2B). Owing to the resemblance of the meiosis II phenotype of pSCC1-IPL1 spo11Δ cells to that of IPL1-deficient mitotic cells, we conclude that IPL1 is required for sister kinetochore biorientation during meiosis II. During mitosis, cohesins are lost along the entire length of chromosomes at the onset of anaphase, whereas during meiosis, cohesins are lost in a stepwise manner (reviewed in Marston and Amon, 2004Marston A.L. Amon A. Meiosis: cell-cycle controls shuffle and deal.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 983-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Loss of cohesins from chromosome arms is essential for homologs to segregate during meiosis I, and retention of cohesins around centromeres is necessary for sister chromatids to segregate accurately during meiosis II. To determine whether Ipl1 in addition to kinetochore orientation also regulates the loss of sister chromatid cohesion, we examined the localization of the cohesin subunit Rec8 on chromosome spreads. Cells also carried a tagged version of the kinetochore component Ndc10 to identify centromeric regions of chromosomes. In wild-type binucleate cells, Rec8 was found around centromeres (Figure 2C). In contrast, nearly 50% of Ipl1-depleted binucleate cells lacked centromeric Rec8 (Figure 2C). As a control, we also examined the localization of Rec8 in cells lacking SGO1, a gene essential to protect Rec8 from removal around centromeres during meiosis I (Katis et al., 2004aKatis V.L. Galova M. Rabitsch K.P. Gregan J. Nasmyth K. Maintenance of cohesin at centromeres after meiosis I in budding yeast requires a kinetochore-associated protein related to MEI-S332.Curr.

In such cells, Rec8 was absent in binucleate cells (Figure 2C). Our results indicate that IPL1 is required to retain Rec8 at centromeres beyond the first meiotic division, though the gene appears to be less important than SGO1. Ipl1-depleted cells also exhibited defects in the localization of the cohesin protector Sgo1, which itself associates with centromeric regions from prophase I until metaphase II (Katis et al., 2004aKatis V.L.

Only 50% of mononucleate and binucleate Ipl1-depleted cells exhibited Sgo1 localization (Figure 2D and data not shown). Deletion of SPO13, a gene required for the maintenance of Sgo1 at centromeres (Figure 2D; Lee et al., 2004Lee B.H. Kiburz B.M. Amon A. Spo13 maintains centromeric cohesion and kinetochore coorientation during meiosis I.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2168-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar), did not affect Sgo1 localization in mononucleate cells but had more severe effects on Sgo1 localization than Ipl1 depletion in binucleate cells (Figure 2D and data not shown; Katis et al., 2004bKatis V.L.

How Ipl1 affects cohesin loss and why Ipl1 depletion only partially affects Rec8 and Sgo1 localization are at present unclear. The severity of the homolog-cosegregation phenotype of Ipl1-depleted cells (80% cosegregation of homologs during meiosis I) argues against incomplete inactivation of Ipl1 being responsible for the partial effects on Rec8 and Sgo1 localization. Parallel pathways could account for the incomplete penetrance of the phenotype. We note that our findings are consistent with observations in Drosophila, where the Sgo1 homolog MEI-S332 requires Aurora B and INCENP for its association with pericentric regions (Resnick et al., 2006Resnick T.D. Satinover D.L. MacIsaac F. Stukenberg P.T. Earnshaw W.C. Orr-Weaver T.L. Carmena M. INCENP and Aurora B promote meiotic sister chromatid cohesion through localization of the Shugoshin MEI-S332 in Drosophila.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that IPL1 is required for two key aspects of the second meiotic division, sister kinetochore biorientation and the correct timing of loss of cohesins from chromosomes. Having established that Ipl1 regulates kinetochore orientation during meiosis, we next examined the relationship between Ipl1 and coorientation factors. The majority of cells lacking MAM1 and SPO11 carrying heterozygous CENV GFP dots segregate sister chromatids during the first observable chromosome segregation phase, leading to the formation of binucleate cells with a GFP dot in each of the two nuclei (Toth et al., 2000Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Buonomo S.B. Nasmyth K. Functional genomics identifies monopolin: a kinetochore protein required for segregation of homologs during meiosis I.Cell. 2000; 103: 1155-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar; Figure 3A). Remarkably, depletion of Ipl1 in such cells led to the cosegregation of sister chromatids to one spindle pole (Figure 3A). Similar results were obtained when Ipl1 was depleted in cells lacking SPO11 and SPO13. spo13Δ spo11Δ mutants undergo a single meiotic division during which sister chromatids segregate to opposite poles (Klapholz et al., 1985Klapholz S. Waddell C.S. Esposito R.E. The role of the SPO11 gene in meiotic recombination in yeast.Genetics. 1985; 110: 187-216Crossref Google Scholar; Figure 3B). Depletion of Ipl1 in these cells led to the cosegregation of sister chromatids (Figure 3B). Our results indicate that biorientation of sister kinetochores in mam1Δ or spo13Δ mutants requires IPL1 function. Inactivation of SPO13 or MAM1 changed neither Ipl1 localization (Figures S3A and S3B) nor its ability to phosphorylate histone H3 (Figure S3C), indicating that the two proteins did not affect Ipl1 function. The simplest interpretation of our findings is that Ipl1 performs the same function during meiosis I as it does during mitosis and meiosis II—that is, severing microtubule-kinetochore attachments that are not under tension. The monopolin complex's function is to change sister kinetochores in such a way that they are only under tension when homologs are bioriented. To gain further insights into how the monopolin complex brings about sister kinetochore coorientation, we wished to define the minimal number of genes necessary for this process to occur during mitosis. The monopolin complex component Mam1 is not expressed during mitosis. Overexpression of MAM1 alone is, however, not sufficient for sister kinetochore coorientation to occur during mitosis (Figure 4A; Toth et al., 2000Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A.

As Mam1 requires Lrs4 and Csm1 to associate with kinetochores (Rabitsch et al., 2003Rabitsch K.P. Petronczki M. Javerzat J.P. Genier S. Chwalla B. Schleiffer A. Tanaka T.U. Nasmyth K. Kinetochore recruitment of two nucleolar proteins is required for homolog segregation in meiosis I.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the fact that Lrs4 and Csm1 are not released from the nucleolus during mitotic G2 (Toth et al., 2000Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Buonomo S.B. Nasmyth K.

To release Lrs4 and Csm1 from the nucleolus, we overexpressed CDC5 from the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. The presence of a single copy of CDC5 expressed from the GAL1 promoter did not interfere with cell-cycle progression (data not shown) but led to the release of Lrs4 from the nucleolus (Figure S4). As Csm1 localization and Lrs4 localization are interdependent (Rabitsch et al., 2003Rabitsch K.P. Petronczki M. Javerzat J.P. Genier S. Chwalla B. Schleiffer A. Tanaka T.U. Nasmyth K.

https://openalex.org/W2111147894,"In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in manipulating matter with light, and light with matter. Resonant laser fields interacting with cold, dense atom clouds provide a particularly rich system. Such light fields interact strongly with the internal electrons of the atoms, and couple directly to external atomic motion through recoil momenta imparted when photons are absorbed and emitted. Ultraslow light propagation in Bose-Einstein condensates represents an extreme example of resonant light manipulation using cold atoms. Here we demonstrate that a slow light pulse can be stopped and stored in one Bose-Einstein condensate and subsequently revived from a totally different condensate, 160 mum away; information is transferred through conversion of the optical pulse into a travelling matter wave. In the presence of an optical coupling field, a probe laser pulse is first injected into one of the condensates where it is spatially compressed to a length much shorter than the coherent extent of the condensate. The coupling field is then turned off, leaving the atoms in the first condensate in quantum superposition states that comprise a stationary component and a recoiling component in a different internal state. The amplitude and phase of the spatially localized light pulse are imprinted on the recoiling part of the wavefunction, which moves towards the second condensate. When this 'messenger' atom pulse is embedded in the second condensate, the system is re-illuminated with the coupling laser. The probe light is driven back on and the messenger pulse is coherently added to the matter field of the second condensate by way of slow-light-mediated atomic matter-wave amplification. The revived light pulse records the relative amplitude and phase between the recoiling atomic imprint and the revival condensate. Our results provide a dramatic demonstration of coherent optical information processing with matter wave dynamics. Such quantum control may find application in quantum information processing and wavefunction sculpting."
https://openalex.org/W1989823250,"3-Iodothyronamine T1AM is a novel endogenous thyroid hormone derivative that activates the G protein-coupled receptor known as trace anime-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). In the isolated working rat heart and in rat cardiomyocytes, T1AM produced a reversible, dose-dependent negative inotropic effect (e.g., 27+/-5, 51+/-3, and 65+/-2% decrease in cardiac output at 19, 25, and 38 microM concentration, respectively). An independent negative chronotropic effect was also observed. The hemodynamic effects of T1AM were remarkably increased in the presence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, whereas they were attenuated in the presence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate. No effect was produced by inhibitors of protein kinase A, protein kinase C, calcium-calmodulin kinase II, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, or MAP kinases. Tissue cAMP levels were unchanged. In rat ventricular tissue, Western blot experiments with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies showed reduced phosphorylation of microsomal and cytosolic proteins after perfusion with synthetic T1AM; reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed the presence of transcripts for at least 5 TAAR subtypes; specific and saturable binding of [125I]T1AM was observed, with a dissociation constant in the low micromolar range (5 microM); and endogenous T1AM was detectable by tandem mass spectrometry. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence for the existence of a novel aminergic system modulating cardiac function."
https://openalex.org/W1977289330,"Pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus require iron to survive and have evolved specialized proteins to steal heme from their host. IsdC is the central conduit of the Isd (iron-regulated surface determinant) multicomponent heme uptake machinery; staphylococcal cell-surface proteins such as IsdA, IsdB, and IsdH are thought to funnel their molecular cargo to IsdC, which then mediates the transfer of the iron-containing nutrient to the membrane translocation system IsdDEF. The structure of the heme-IsdC complex reveals a novel heme site within an immunoglobulin-like domain and sheds light on its binding mechanism. The folding topology is reminiscent of the architecture of cytochrome f, cellobiose dehydrogenase, and ethylbenzene dehydrogenase; in these three proteins, the heme is bound in an equivalent position, but interestingly, IsdC features a distinct binding pocket with the ligand located next to the hydrophobic core of the β-sandwich. The iron is coordinated with a tyrosine surrounded by several non-polar side chains that cluster into a tightly packed proximal side. On the other hand, the distal side is relatively exposed with a short helical peptide segment that acts as a lip clasping onto almost half of the porphyrin plane. This structural feature is argued to play a role in the mechanism of binding and release by switching to an open conformation and thus loosening the interactions holding the heme. The structure of the heme-IsdC complex provides a template for the understanding of other proteins, such as IsdA, IsdB, and IsdH, that contain the same heme-binding module as IsdC, known as the NEAT (near transporter) domain.

Iron is essential to living organisms for it is used, for instance, by cytochromes in cellular energy transduction processes. Bacterial pathogens require iron to infect cells and proliferate (1Posey J.E. Gherardini F.C. Science. 2000; 288: 1651-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and therefore rely on their host for acquisition of iron. Given the low availability of free iron in tissues and cells, microbial species have evolved specific receptors and carriers capable of high affinity binding to steal heme from host proteins. Most of the research carried out so far on iron/heme uptake systems in bacteria has focused on Gram-negative species. In addition to data from various biochemical experiments, HasA, a heme-siderophore secreted by the pathogen Serratia marcescens, was the first bacterial heme carrier protein to have had its structure elucidated in complex with heme (2Arnoux P. Haser R. Izadi N. Lecroisey A. Delepierre M. Wandersman C. Czjzek M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The heme uptake system HemRSTUV, widespread throughout Proteobacteria, has also been studied extensively (3Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodriguez-Quinones F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar, 4Faraldo-Gomez J.D. Sansom M.S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Perkins-Balding D. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This multicomponent system includes an outer membrane receptor HemR, able to bind free heme or sequester it from host heme proteins, coupled with a periplasmic shuttling carrier, HemT, which mediates the transfer to the HemUV complex, responsible for translocation of heme through the inner membrane and final passage to the cytoplasmic recipient HemS. In some cases, the HemR receptor is associated with an auxiliary protein, such as PhuW with PhuR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa or ChaN with ChaR in Campylobacter jejuni (7Ochsner U.A. Johnson Z. Vasil M.L. Microbiology (Reading). 2000; 146: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 8van Vliet A.H.M. Ketley J.M. Park S.F. Penn C.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 173-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (PhuR and ChaR are homologous proteins to HemR; the nomenclature refers to the different species). Several genetic and biochemical investigations, predominantly in Yersinia enterocolitica and Shigella dysenteriae, have contributed to the understanding of this heme uptake system (3Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodriguez-Quinones F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar, 4Faraldo-Gomez J.D. Sansom M.S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Perkins-Balding D. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies on two components, ChaN and HemS, have added insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in heme binding. The structure of the heme-ChaN complex revealed an unprecedented mode of heme binding with the loading of the ligand accompanied by dimerization of the protein (9Chan A.C. Lelj-Garolla B. Rosell F.I. Pedersen K.A. Mauk A.G. Murphy M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 1108-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HemS was analyzed both in its apo form and in complex with heme; comparison of the two states unveiled a heme-induced fit conformational change with the N- and C-terminal domains closing onto the ligand (10Schneider S. Sharp K.H. Barker P.D. Paoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32606-32610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A significant amount of work has also been done to understand the heme uptake process in Gram-positive bacteria, but no structural information is available yet on a carrier protein in complex with heme. In the “hospital superbug” Staphylococcus aureus, the Isd 2The abbreviations used are: Isd, iron-regulated surface determinant system; NEAT, near transporter; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DLS, dynamic light scattering; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous dispersion.2The abbreviations used are: Isd, iron-regulated surface determinant system; NEAT, near transporter; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DLS, dynamic light scattering; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous dispersion. iron/heme uptake system (iron-regulated surface determinant) includes proteins for the sequestration, transport, and internalization of heme (reviewed in Refs. 11Maresso A.W. Schneewind O. Biometals. 2006; 19: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and 12Skaar E.P. Schneewind O. Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It appears that more than one heme uptake pathway may exist in Staphylococcus, as suggested by the recent identification of the novel heme transport regulators HrtAB (13Friedman D.B. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Whitwell C.W. Torres V.J. Skaar E.P. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: 777-789Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the Isd system, the IsdA, IsdB, and IsdH components are attached to the cell wall and transfer their load to IsdC, which is the central conduit in this funnel-like uptake machinery. Passage through the membrane is then mediated by the IsdE/D/F complex, for final delivery to the cytosolic heme oxygenases IsdG and IsdI. IsdA, IsdB, and IsdH are being used to develop vaccines against S. aureus to reduce the occurrence of disease (14Clarke S.R. Brummell K.J. Horsburgh M.J. McDowell P.W. Syed Mohamad S.A. Stapleton M.R. Acevedo J. Read R.C. Day N.P.J. Peacock S.J. Mond J.J. Kokai-Kun J.F. Foster S.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2006; 193: 1098-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Kuklin N.A.

Immun. 2006; 74: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Based on sequence comparisons, IsdA, IsdB, IsdH, and IsdC are all believed to contain one or more copies of the same heme-binding structural module, known as the NEAT domain (16Andrade M.A. Ciccarelli F.D. Perez-Iratxeta C. Bork P. Genome Bio. 2002; 3 (research 0047.1-0047.5)PubMed Google Scholar). Although biochemical and spectroscopic studies on some components of the system have been carried out (for example, Refs. 17Clarke S.R. Wiltshire M.D. Foster S.J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12867-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the structural basis of heme binding and the molecular mechanisms of heme transfer are still unexplored. Molecular data on the NEAT domain-containing proteins could also help in the design of better vaccines. Since IsdC is the central conduit of the Isd heme uptake system, we have studied its x-ray crystal structure in complex with heme. Cloning and Overexpression—The gene encoding IsdC (National Center for Biotechnology Information number gi:13700931) was amplified from S. aureus genomic DNA (strain RN639OB) by PCR using the forward and reverse primers: IsdC, forward, 5′-gcgactttggatccgatagcggtactttgaattatg-3′, and IsdC reverse, 5′-cgcattttaagcttattctactttgtctttattcgcac-3′. The codons for the signal peptide and cell wall-anchoring motifs were omitted. The PCR-amplified product was cloned into the T7-based expression vector pGAT2 (22Peranen J. Rikkonen M. Hyvonen M. Kaariainen L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 cells (Novagen). An overnight culture of 5 ml of Luria Bertani medium was used to inoculate 0.5 liters of 2× YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin (Melford) to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Cultures were shaken in 2-liter baffled flasks at 220 rpm at 37 °C until they reached an A600 of 0.6-1.0; protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cultures were then transferred at 30 °C and further grown overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4600 rpm for 30 min and stored frozen at -20 °C. Once resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was centrifuged twice at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. Purification—Protein purification was carried out, taking advantage of the double tag (His6 and GST) provided by the expression vector, first by metal affinity chromatography (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, Qiagen) and then by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The His-GST tag was removed by proteolytic cleavage with thrombin (10 units/mg of protein, Cambridge Biosciences) at room temperature overnight. Thrombin was removed by incubation with p-amino-benzamidine-agarose (Sigma) (2 μl/unit of thrombin); cleaved His-GST tags and uncleaved protein were separated from the cleaved IsdC preparation by means of a further glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography step. IsdC was reconstituted with its heme ligand by incubating it with a 2-fold molar excess of hemin chloride (Sigma) at 4 °C for 30 min before removing excess hemin by gel filtration. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Analytical gel filtration was carried out using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to a fast performance liquid chromatography system (ÁKTA). The column was equilibrated with 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. A sample volume of 1 ml at a concentration of 3 mg/ml was injected into the column and run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Protein elution was followed by absorption measurements at 280 nm and also at the Soret absorbance peak of 400 nm. The column was calibrated with an Amersham Biosciences Biotechnologies low molecular weight gel filtration kit. IsdC elutes with a volume equivalent to a molecule of about 30,000 Da. However, the calculated molecular mass of IsdC is 17,500 Da, thus making it plausible that IsdC may be a dimer. Given the long molecular shape of IsdC and that changing conditions such as concentration of protein and salts made no difference to any peaks in terms of a possible monomer-dimer equilibrium, we believe that IsdC is not likely to be a dimer, exactly as observed in the case of gel filtration work on IsdA (21Vermeiren C.L. Pluym M. Mack J. Heinrichs D.E. Stillman M.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12867-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, further analysis was carried out using dynamic light scattering (DLS). Dynamic Light Scattering—Experiments were carried out at room temperature in a 1-ml quartz cuvette (path length 1 cm) containing IsdC at 0.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Prior to the DLS study, protein samples were passed through a 0.2-μm filter and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Data were collected with a Viscotek model 802 DLS instrument. Measurements were programmed using the software OmniSIZE 2.0 (Viscotek Europe Ltd.) such that each experiment was averaged over 10 runs, each for 20 s. The results were processed with the OmniSIZE software. Results from five experiments give a radius of 47.3 nm (± 2.5 nm). The monomer has a maximal width of 50 nm as measured from the crystal structure, and the dimer has a width of 80 nm. The DLS data therefore indicate that IsdC is a monomer in the conditions tested. Crystallization—Crystals were obtained using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method with samples of IsdC at 95 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl mixed in equal volumes (2 + 2 μl) with reservoir solution containing 26% polyethylene glycol 550 mono-methyl-ether, 18 mm zinc sulfate, and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0. IsdC crystals typically grew to a size of 40 × 60 × 130 μm after 2 weeks. Before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen, crystals were soaked in 27.5% polyethylene glycol 550 monomethyl-ether, 19 mm zinc sulfate, and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, for cryo-protection. Data Collection and Phasing—Diffraction data were collected at liquid nitrogen temperature at the beamlines ID14 and ID29, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble, France), and processed with the programs MOS-FLM (23Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, Number 26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and SCALA (24Evans P. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1997; 33: 22-24Google Scholar) of the CCP4 suite (25Collaborative Computing Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). IsdC crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 and contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 43%. Phases were determined using the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method, taking advantage of the iron atom in the heme prosthetic group. The iron peak and inflection point were determined by an x-ray fluorescence scan around the iron resonance edge, and data sets were collected at 1.739 (peak), 1.741 (inflection), and 1.722 Å (remote). The heme iron was located with SHELXD (26Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar), and phase calculations were carried out with SHARP/autoSHARP (27Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 215-230Google Scholar). A high resolution native data set was collected at 0.933 Å. Diffraction data statistics are reported in supplemental Table 1 online. Model Building and Refinement—The model was built manually using COOT (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar) and then refined against the high resolution native data set using restrained and Translation-Libration-Skew (TLS) tensors refinement in REFMAC5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar). The optimal number of TLS groups was determined using the TLSMD server (30Painter J. Merritt E.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 109-111Crossref Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The final model consists of residues 28-150 for chain A and residues 28-146 for chain B and has excellent geometry and no Ramachandran outliers. The construct used for the overexpression of IsdC also includes residues 151-188, but these are not part of the model because only weak, broken peaks of electron density were obtained for this region, and the maps could not be interpreted. Visual inspection of the sequence reveals that this stretch of polypeptide chain is almost exclusively made up of small, polar, and charged amino acids, consistent with this region forming random coil, disordered structure.

Open table in a new tab Homology Modeling—The sequences of IsdA (residues 65-184) and IsdC (residues 30-150) were aligned using CLUSTAL W (32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55635) Google Scholar). Based on this alignment and on the structural data of the heme-IsdC complex, a model of IsdA was constructed using MODELLER (33Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). The best generated models were energy-minimized and then evaluated in PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Further docking studies were performed using GOLD 2.0 (Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking) (35Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5365) Google Scholar). Coordinates for heme were subjected to docking calculations using the best IsdA model with the docking site defined as the three-dimensional space within 20 Å of His-83. Docking calculations were performed with default settings and with atom types as defined in INSIGHTII (Accyelrys Inc.). The best scoring 10 results were viewed in SILVER (35Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5365) Google Scholar), and the two most common conformations are shown in supplemental Fig. 3. The structure of the heme-IsdC complex was determined using phases from Fe-MAD experiments, and atomic coordinates were refined against data to 1.5 Å resolution (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Two molecules are present in the asymmetric unit, but their conformations do not differ significantly (1 Å root mean square deviation for main chain atoms and 1.4 Å for all atoms). Despite the association between the molecules in the lattice, IsdC is a monomer as determined by gel filtration and dynamic light scattering. Over 35 amino acids are missing from the model (see “Experimental Procedures”), which amounts to almost 20% of the scattering matter; this corresponds to a highly disordered C-terminal tail presumably important to provide IsdC with a flexible foot extending from the cell wall matrix. The overall structure resembles the architecture previously unveiled by the NMR work on the apo N-terminal NEAT domain of IsdH, termed IsdHN1 (20Pilpa R.M. Fadeev E.A. Villareal V.A. Wong M.L. Phillips M. Clubb R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), although the two proteins share only 16% of their amino acid sequence. Comparison of the IsdC and IsdH structures by least-squares fitting of 50 equivalent Cα atoms gives a root mean square deviation of about 2 Å (see structure-based sequence alignment in supplemental Fig. 1A). Therefore, it can now be accepted that all Isd proteins distantly related by the NEAT signature indeed share the same structural module. The fold is characterized by eight elements of extended secondary structure, split between a three-stranded sheet and a four-stranded sheet that pack into a twisted anti-parallel β-sandwich connected on one side by an eighth strand. This folding topology can be described as an immunoglobulin-like fold, also seen in three other heme proteins: cellobiose dehydrogenase (36Hallberg B.M. Bergfors T. Backbro K. Pettersson G. Henriksson G. Divne C. Structure. 2000; 8: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), ethylbenzene dehydrogenase (37Kloer D.P. Hagel C. Heider J. Schulz G.E. Structure (Camb.). 2006; 14: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and cytochrome f (38Chi Y.I. Huang L.S. Zhang Z. Fernandez-Velasco J.G. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7689-7701Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 2). In these three proteins, the heme is located in a topologically equivalent position, packing against the face of one of the β-sheets and embraced by additional elements of secondary structure as well as substantial loop regions. By contrast, IsdC has a simpler architecture with a distinct heme site, formed at the edge of the hydrophobic core between the two sheets (Fig. 2). A prominent feature of this heme-binding region is a long β-hairpin-like structure that protrudes from one of the sheets, providing a platform onto which the ligand rests (Fig. 3). From this side, proximal to the heme, Tyr-132 reaches the five-coordinate iron, which is displaced 0.5 Å from the plane of the pyrrole nitrogens. On the distal side, a short stretch of 4-5 amino acids (48-52) in a 310-helical conformation acts as a lip that clasps onto one side of tetrapyrrole ring (Fig. 3A) extending across almost half of the porphyrin plane (Fig. 3B). Ile-48 is placed more or less centrally over the iron and pairs up with Tyr-52 that stacks, offset, over one of the pyrrole rings. More extensive interactions occur at the proximal side and by the edge of the heme. Tyr-136 is engaged with the proximal tyrosine through a hydrogen bond, which may help to stabilize the coordinate bonding to the iron. In addition, Tyr-136 is coplanar with one of the pyrroles, approximately opposite Ile-48 (Fig. 3A). Other proximal residues include Val-119 and Ile-121 that cluster with the two tyrosines and offer further hydrophobic surfaces to the binding pocket.FIGURE 3Schematic representation of the structure of the heme-IsdC complex. In A, the figure highlights the lip region, shown in red, with the distal Ile-48 and Tyr-52 over the heme, as well as the prominent β-hairpin structure, in dark blue, with Tyr-136 hydrogen-bonded to the proximal Tyr-132, both in cyan. Finally, Trp-77, Ile-78, and Ile-117, in green, pack along the equatorial plane of the porphyrin, effectively interlocking the heme into its binding pocket. B, surface representation of the heme-IsdC complex. The heme is shown in yellow in a space-filling model, and the molecular surface is colored according to the scheme used in Fig. 2A with the β-hairpin-like structure in blue and the 310-helical segment in red. The figure highlights the exposure of the heme, 34% of which remains accessible to the solvent, as reported in supplemental Table 2. At the same time, the steric bulk of the distal isoleucine, over the iron, is also apparent, which results in the occlusion of the sixth coordinate position of the metal center.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A key set of contacts is provided by Trp-77, Ile-78, and Ile-117, which pack along two sides of the tetrapyrrole; Ile-117 and Trp-77 in particular make van der Waals contacts with the vinyl and methyl groups of the porphyrin, interlocking the heme into its pocket. The interactions associated with Trp-77 (Fig. 4) are believed to be unique to IsdC because the other staphylococcal NEAT domains (20Pilpa R.M. Fadeev E.A. Villareal V.A. Wong M.L. Phillips M. Clubb R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) all lack this tryptophan but instead have a conserved tryptophan at a position adjacent to Trp-77. A structural superposition of IsdC and IsdHN1 shows that the conserved tryptophan would be unlikely to contribute the same contacts of high steric complementarity as Trp-77. It is therefore possible that the heme in IsdHN1 and other NEAT domains binds in a slightly different orientation. It is also tempting to speculate that Trp-77 is responsible for the stability of the heme-IsdC complex since IsdC is thought to receive its cargo from the other NEAT domains. In the heme-IsdC complex, the ligand is not completely buried into the protein and remains distinctively exposed to the solvent (Fig. 3B). Despite this exposure, the site above the center of the porphyrin is occupied by Ile-48, which is less than 4 Å away from the iron. The distal isoleucine therefore appears to sterically hinder the sixth coordination position of the iron, providing an explanation for our spectroscopic observations in which no binding of cyanide or azide could be detected even after prolonged incubations of protein samples with high concentrations of these strong-field ligands. Modeling of a cyanide molecule bound to the heme in IsdC shows that Cβ of the distal isoleucine would only be 1.8 and 2.5 Å away from the N and C atoms, respectively. Interestingly, a similar observation was made in spectroscopy experiments on IsdA in which cyanide did not bind to the heme-loaded IsdA (21Vermeiren C.L. Pluym M. Mack J. Heinrichs D.E. Stillman M.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12867-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Given that the binding of cyanide is so effectively prevented, it appears that the interactions of both Ile-48 and Tyr-52 are strong enough to maintain a stable molecular “seal” across the surface of the heme. Different rotameric conformations do not appear to be sufficient to relieve steric hindrance, and a more substantial displacement involving backbone atoms may be required to “peel” the 310-helical lip off the top of the porphyrin. The heme protein contact area is limited (380 Å2) relative to other heme transport proteins such as HemS (480 Å2) (10Schneider S. Sharp K.H. Barker P.D. Paoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32606-32610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), HasA (468 Å2) (2Arnoux P. Haser R. Izadi N. Lecroisey A. Delepierre M. Wandersman C. Czjzek M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and hemopexin (479 Å2) (39Paoli M. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Morgan W.T. Smith A. Baker E.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 926-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the heme is less buried into the protein, with 34% of the heme surface remaining accessible to the solvent in IsdC, as opposed to 19% in HemS and 25% in both HasA and hemopexin. The trend is that in comparison with catalytic heme proteins, the ligand remains significantly exposed to the solvent in heme carriers (Table 2). This is likely to be related to their function, which is to unload the cargo just as much as to sequester it. As part of the mechanism of binding and release, we envisage that a conformational change, limited to the heme pocket, is probable, with local shifts of side chains, and likely to involve a structural rearrangement of the 310-helical lip (residues 48-52), distal to the heme. In the apo structure of IsdHN1 (20Pilpa R.M. Fadeev E.A. Villareal V.A. Wong M.L. Phillips M. Clubb R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the NMR data indicate that the peptide segment corresponding to this structural feature is the most flexible and mobile part of the molecule. It is therefore conceivable that the helical lip plays a critical role in the association and dissociation of heme, whereby the tight 310-helix unwinds, thus switching from a fixed, locked conformation in the ligand-loaded state to an open, more mobile structure in the unbound state. This mechanism may well be a universal feature of all NEAT domains since IsdC, IsdA, IsdBN2, and IsdHN3 all have very similar sequences in the lip region and, despite the weaker conservation, a relationship can also be recognized in IsdBN1, IsdHN1, and IsdHN2.TABLE 2Exposure of the heme in heme-carrier proteins and a set of enzymatic heme proteinsMoleculeSASA hemeSASA heme%Å2IsdC34284HemS19155HasA25203Hemopexin25209Cytochrome f329Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase1080Cellobiose dehydrogenase16181 Open table in a new tab Homology modeling, based on the heme-IsdC structure, was used to evaluate how the NEAT domain of IsdA binds heme (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Fig. 1B); although it appears that the two proximal tyrosine residues are conserved, changes in the pocket of IsdA suggest a different binding orientation for the ligand. The model also shows that in IsdA, a histidine replaces Ile-48 of IsdC, and it is thus positioned above the heme (supplemental Fig. 3), in line with spectro-scopic measurements in which it was observed that upon reduction of the iron, there is a swap from a coordinating tyrosine to a histidine (21Vermeiren C.L. Pluym M. Mack J. Heinrichs D.E. Stillman M.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12867-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The model also shows that the histidine is unlikely to relieve the hindrance on the sixth coordination site of the iron unless significant main chain rearrangements take place, and this explains the observations made on the lack of cyanide binding (21Vermeiren C.L. Pluym M. Mack J. Heinrichs D.E. Stillman M.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12867-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The UV-visible spectrum of IsdC (supplemental Fig. 4), with absorption maxima at 400, 500, 535, and 630 nm, is similar to that of IsdA (21Vermeiren C.L. Pluym M. Mack J. Heinrichs D.E. Stillman M.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12867-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which shows major peaks at 406, 505, 540, and 627 nm. This suggests that the two proteins share an equivalent iron coordination environment. The absorption maxima observed for IsdC and IsdA are also common to native UV-visible spectra of bovine liver catalase (40Browett W.R. Stillman M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 577: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and coral allene oxide synthase (41Abraham B.D. Sono M. Boutaud O. Shriner A. Dawson J.H. Brash A.R. Gaffney B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These data, together with measurements using other spectroscopic techniques (i.e. magnetic circular dichroism and EPR), indicated that in these proteins, the iron is liganded by a tyrosine and has a high spin, five-coordinate geometry. This is in agreement with both the crystal structure of IsdC and the homology model of IsdA. Since ligand loading and unloading, as well as ligand transfer, are the main molecular tasks of Isd-NEAT proteins, correlating structural with functional features should provide insights into the passage of heme from cell surface proteins to IsdC in Staphylococcus as well as other species with IsdC homologues (supplemental Fig. 1C) or with molecules containing NEAT domains. The structure of the heme-IsdC complex offers a template to help in the understanding of these novel heme-binding modules. Addendum—It is noted that at the time of review of this manuscript, the structure determination of the NEAT domain of IsdA in complex with heme was reported (42Grigg J.C. Vermeiren C.L. Heinrichs D.E. Murphy M.E.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).

We demonstrated previously that CD26 binds to caveolin-1 in antigen-presenting cells, and following exogenous CD26 stimulation, Tollip and IRAK-1 disengage from caveolin-1 in antigen-presenting cells. IRAK-1 is then subsequently phosphorylated to up-regulate CD86 expression, resulting in subsequent T-cell proliferation. However, it is unclear whether caveolin-1 is a costimulatory ligand for CD26 in T-cells. Using soluble caveolin-1-Fc fusion protein, we now show that caveolin-1 is the costimulatory ligand for CD26, and that ligation of CD26 by caveolin-1 induces T-cell proliferation and NF-κB activation in a T-cell receptor/CD3-dependent manner. We also demonstrated that the cytoplasmic tail of CD26 interacts with CARMA1 in T-cells, resulting in signaling events that lead to NF-κB activation. Ligation of CD26 by caveolin-1 recruits a complex consisting of CD26, CARMA1, Bcl10, and IκB kinase to lipid rafts. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the regulation of T-cell costimulation via the CD26 molecule.

Morimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4586-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). CD26 may therefore have an important role in T-cell biology and overall immune function. However, the costimulatory ligand of CD26 has not yet been identified, and the proximal signaling events following CD26 engagement in T-cell remain to be determined. In our previous study (14Ohnuma K. Yamochi T. Uchiyama M. Nishibashi K. Yoshikawa N. Shimizu N. Iwata S. Tanaka H. Dang N.H. Morimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14186-14191Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we identified caveolin-1 in antigen-presenting cells (APC) as a binding protein for CD26, and we demonstrated that CD26 on activated memory T-cells directly faces caveolin-1 on tetanus toxoid-loaded monocytes in the contact area, which was revealed as the immunological synapse for T-cell-APC interaction. Moreover, we showed that residues 201-211 of CD26 along with the serine catalytic site at residue 630, which constitute a pocket structure of CD26/DP-PIV, contribute to binding to caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (14Ohnuma K.

More recently, we demonstrated that caveolin-1 binds to Tollip (Toll-interacting protein) and IRAK-1 (interleukin-1 receptor associated serine/threonine kinase 1) in the membrane of tetanus toxoid-loaded monocytes, and following exogenous CD26 stimulation, Tollip and IRAK-1 disengage from caveolin-1, with IRAK-1 being subsequently phosphorylated to up-regulate CD86 expression (15Ohnuma K.

It is conceivable that the interaction of CD26 with caveolin-1 on antigen-loaded monocytes results in CD86 up-regulation, therefore enhancing the subsequent interaction of CD86 and CD28 on T-cells to induce antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and activation. However, it is unclear whether caveolin-1 itself is the costimulatory ligand for T-cell CD26. Recent studies have demonstrated that a newly identified membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like (MAGUK) molecule, CARMA1, is required for TCR/CD3-CD28 costimulation-induced NF-κB activation and functions downstream of protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ) (16Egawa T.

After TCR/CD3-CD28 costimulation or PMA-CD28 stimulation, CARMA1 is phosphorylated by PKCθ, followed by association with Bcl10 and MALT1, and recruitment of these complexes into lipid rafts (21Che T.

The recruitment of the CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex activates IκB kinase (IKK) through a ubiquitin-dependent pathway, leading to activation of NF-κB (24Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol.

However, it remains to be determined whether CARMA1 is associated with lipid rafts directly or is recruited to lipid rafts via undetermined lipid raft-interacting proteins in the immunological synapse of T-cells. In this study, using recombinant immunoglobulin-caveolin-1 fusion proteins, we identify caveolin-1 as the costimulatory ligand for CD26, and we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of caveolin-1 induces T-cell proliferation and cytokine production via CD26 costimulation. Furthermore, we show that CARMA1 is bound to the cytoplasmic tail of dimeric CD26 on T-cells and that this interaction of CD26 and CARMA1 plays a pivotal role in CD26-mediated T-cell costimulation. Our data hence identify a previously unknown ligand for CD26 as a costimulatory molecule while elucidating the mechanisms involved in CD26-mediated T-cell activation and differentiation. Expression and Purification of Fc Proteins—For initial attempts at expression of soluble forms of Fc fusion proteins, human IgG1 Fc cassette vector was made using pCAG-EB6-MCS vector (28Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar, 29Tanaka J. Miwa Y. Miyoshi K. Ueno A. Inoue H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The 3′ portion of this cassette vector corresponding to human Ig Cγ1 (Fcγ1) sequencing (comprising hinge + CH2 + CH3 regions) was made by PCR. All the primer information used in this study is described in the Supplemental Material. The 5′ portion of the cassette vector containing the signal peptide from human E-cadherin (huECDSP) was made by PCR. Final constructs were assembled by ligating both fragments of HindIII-Fcγ1-EcoRI and SalI-huECDSP-HindIII into SalI/EcoRI-cleaved pCAG-EB6-MCS (pCAG-EB6-huECDSP-Fcγ1). The N-terminal domain of human caveolin-1 (CavNT) was made by PCR and constructed into pCAG-EB6-huECDSP-Fcγ1 (pCAG-EB6-huECDSP-CavNT-Fcγ1). With the same methods, the N-terminal domain with deletion of the scaffolding domain (CavNTΔSCD) was made by PCR (pCAG-EB6-huECDSP-CavNTΔSCD-Fcγ1). The Fc fusion protein containing amino acids 1-10 of human CD26 cytoplasmic tail (CD26 aa1-10) was constructed in identical fashion, using the primers described in the Supplemental Material (pCAG-EB6-huECDSP-CD26 aa1-10-Fcγ1). For expression of Fc fusion proteins, FreeStyle™ 293 expression system was used according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). The Fc fusion proteins expressed in the culture supernatant were then purified by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Bio-Rad) followed by size-exclusion purification on Microcon® centrifugal filter devices (Millipore), and sterilized using inner diameter 0.22-μm filter microcentrifugation tube Spin-X (Corning Glass). Cells and Reagents—HEK293FT human embryonal kidney, Jurkat T-cell line (JKTwt), and Jurkat T-cells stably transfected with human CD26 (J.CD26wt) were grown as described previously (2Tanaka T.

CARMA1-deficient Jurkat T-cell line, JPM50.6, was developed as described elsewhere (18Wang D. You Y. Case S.M. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Wang L. DiStefano P.S. Nunez G. Bertin J. Lin X. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 830-835Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Human peripheral blood T-cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using MACS Pan T-cell isolation kit II (Miltenyi), collected from healthy adult volunteers and incubated according to the methods described previously (30Ohnuma K.

Informed consent was obtained from healthy adult volunteers. Biotinylation of recombinant proteins or antibody was generated using EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin reagents according to the manufacturer's instruction (Pierce). Protease inhibitor mixture, phosphatase inhibitor mixture, and poly-l-lysine were from Sigma. Water-soluble digitonin was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals Industries, Ltd. Biacore™ Analysis of Affinity of Caveolin-1-CD26 Interaction—Experiments were carried out on a Biacore™ J (Biacore, Japan) using HBS buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) supplied by the manufacturer (Biacore AB). Fcγ1, NT-Fc, or NTΔSCD-Fc was coupled in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) to a research grade CM5 sensor chip (Biacore AB) using the amine coupling kit (Biacore AB), with an activating time of 5 min, resulting in immobilization of ∼5,000-6,000 response units (RU). The surface of the chip was washed with 5 mm NaOH after coupling. NaOH (5 mm) was used also to regenerate immobilized Fcγ1, NT-Fc, or NTΔSCD-Fc chips after each experiment. Recombinant soluble CD26 (rsCD26), comprising the extracellular region of human CD26, was prepared as described previously (30Ohnuma K. Munakata Y. Ishii T. Iwata S. Kobayashi S. Hosono O.

Equilibrium binding analysis was performed as described elsewhere (32Nath D. van der Merwe P.A. Kelm S. Bradfield P. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26184-26191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), using the BIAevaluation software version 2.1 (Biacore AB). Generating Stable Transfectants—The construct of V5-tagged full-length human CD26 (pEF6/V5-CD26wt) was made by PCR, using the primers described in the Supplemental Material. The amplified products were cloned into the pEF6/V5-His B vector (Invitrogen) at the BamHI/EcoRI site. The CD26-CD10 chimeric receptor was composed of the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of human CD10 (1-23-amino acid position) ligated to the transmembrane and extracellular regions of human CD26 (7-766-amino acid position), which were made by PCR. The construct of V5-tagged monomeric human CD26 (CD26H750E), which has histidine replacing glutamic acid as a point mutation at amino acid position 750, was made by site-directed mutagenesis method using pEF6/V5-CD26w as a template with the primers described in the Supplemental Material. After constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing, plasmids were transfected to Jurkat T-cells using Nucleofector II device according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amaxa Biosystems). Two days after transfection of indicated plasmids, the cells were selected for blasticidin (1 μg/ml) resistance for 4 weeks. Single clone cells expressing CD26wt (V5-CD26wt), CD26-CD10 (V5-CD26 + CD10 cyto), and CD26H750E were then selected using standard limiting dilution method. For rescue experiments, the CARMA1-deficient Jurkat cell line JPM50.6 was transfected with expression vectors of CD26 and/or CARMA1. The constructs of Xpress-tagged CARMA1 and its deletion mutant (CARMA1wt, CARMA1-(1-742), or CARMA1-(1-660), respectively) were made by PCR, using primers described in the Supplemental Material. The PCR products were ligated into pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO (Invitrogen). After constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing, plasmids were transfected to JPM50.6 cells using the Nucleo-fector II device according to the manufacturer's instruction. Two days after transfection of the indicated plasmids, the cells were selected for blasticidin (1 μg/ml, for cells transfected with pEF6/V5 vectors) or Zeocin (10 μg/ml, for cells transfected with pcDNA4/HisMax vectors) resistance for 4 weeks. Single clone cells expressing CD26wt (JPM50.6/CD26wt), CARMA1wt (JPM50.6/CARMA1wt), CD26wt and CARMA1wt (JPM50.6/CD26wt + CARMA1wt), or CD26wt and CARMA1-(1-660) (JPM50.6/CD26wt + CARMA1-(1-660)) were then selected using standard limiting dilution method. For stimulation experiments using the expression system, CHO-K1 cells were transfected with GFP-fused full-length caveolin-1 or SCD-deleted caveolin-1 expression plasmids, with the constructs being described previously (14Ohnuma K. Yamochi T. Uchiyama M. Nishibashi K. Yoshikawa N. Shimizu N. Iwata S. Tanaka H. Dang N.H. Morimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14186-14191Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), using Lipo-fectamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection of the indicated plasmids, the cells were selected for G418 (500 μg/ml) resistance for 4 weeks. Single clone cells expressing GFP and caveolin-1, detected by anti-caveolin-1 pAb (N20) recognizing the N-terminal region of caveolin-1 using flow cytometry (FACSCalibur™), were then selected using standard limiting dilution method. Flow Cytometric Analysis—For assessment of J.CD26wt that binds biotinylated NT-Fc or NTΔSCD-Fc, 1 × 106 cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Fcγ1 and mouse Ig isotypes (1 μg/ml) to block nonspecific binding, followed by reaction with biotinylated NT-Fc or NTΔSCD-Fc (1 μg/ml), and subsequently stained with FITC-conjugated streptavidin (1:500). For blocking experiments, unlabeled mouse IgG (20 μg/ml) or unlabeled anti-CD26 mAb (20 μg/ml) was incubated with cells prior to reaction with bio-tinylated NT-Fc or NTΔSCD-Fc. Flow cytometric analysis of 10,000 viable cells was conducted on FACSCalibur™. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and the results were provided in the form of a histogram or dot plots of a representative experiment. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) against Human CARMA1—We selected two target sequences from nucleotides +305 to +325 (ss1) and +792 to + 802 (ss2) downstream of the start codon of human CARMA1 mRNA (sense1 siRNA (ss1-siRNA), 5′ AAGAGCCCACUCGGAGAUUCUdTdT, and sense2 siRNA (ss2-siRNA), 5′ AACUGGAGCGGGAGAAUGAAAdTdT). Moreover, mis-siRNA at four nucleotides was prepared to examine nonspecific effects of siRNA duplexes (mis-siRNA, 5′ UAGUGGCCACACGGUGATTCdTdT). These selected sequences also were submitted to a BLAST search against the human genome sequence to ensure that only one gene of the human genome was targeted. siRNAs were purchased from Qiagen. Transfection of siRNA into purified T-cells were conducted using HVJ-E vector (GenomeONE™; kindly provided by Ihsihara Sangyo Kaisha Ltd.) as described previously (14Ohnuma K. Yamochi T. Uchiyama M. Nishibashi K. Yoshikawa N. Shimizu N. Iwata S. Tanaka H. Dang N.H. Morimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14186-14191Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After 48 h of transfection, cell were prepared for examination. T-cell Proliferation and IL-2 Production Assay—For T-cell proliferation assay, 1 × 105 purified T-cells were cultured in 96-well flat-bottomed plates (COSTAR) in a volume of 200 μl of AIM-V medium (Invitrogen). For solid-phase stimulation, anti-CD3 (OKT3, 0.05 μg/ml) and/or anti-CD26 mAb (5 μg/ml), anti-CD28 mAb (4B10, 5 μg/ml), or Fc fusion proteins (5 μg/ml) were bound on the plates. For stimulation with caveolin-1-transfected CHO cells, purified T-cells were cultured in the presence of soluble anti-CD3 (OKT3, 0.05 μg/ml) at 1 × 105 cells/well with varying amounts (T-cells: CHO = 800, 400, 200, 100, 50, 25:1 or no CHO cells as background control) of CHO cell transfectants. Before coculturing with T-cells, CHO transfectants were fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 30 s at room temperature, followed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline. T-cell proliferation was measured by [3H]TdR (ICN Radiochemicals) uptake. Cells were incubated for 96 h and were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of [3H]TdR, 16 h prior to harvesting onto a glass fiber filter (Wallac), and the incorporated radioactivity was quantified by a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac). For blocking experiments, cells were treated with soluble anti-CD26 mAb (1F7), anti-CD28 (4B10), or control mouse Ig (each at 20 μg/ml) before being cultured in plates coated with stimulatory antibodies and/or Fc proteins. For IL-2 production assay using Jurkat T-cell lines, JPM50.6, or their transfectants, 5 × 105 cells/well in 200 μl of culture media were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of the indicated plate-bound antibodies and/or NT-Fc proteins. Cells were also stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) in anti-CD3-coated wells. After 48 h of incubation, culture supernatants were pooled from the triplicate wells and assayed for IL-2 content using Human IL-2 Biotrack Easy ELISA (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Two-dimensional PAGE—For two-dimensional PAGE analysis of cytosolic proteins, Jurkat cells were lysed in TBSD buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% digitonin, 102-fold diluted protease inhibitor mixture, 102-fold diluted phosphatase inhibitor mixture), and then an aliquot (50 μg) of lysates was subjected to two-dimensional PAGE. For pulldown by CD26 aa1-10-Fc, aliquots (1 mg) of lysates were precleared by human IgG (2 μg) and protein A-Sepharose, followed by immunoprecipitation with Fcγ1 (1 μg) or CD26 aa1-10-Fc (1 μg). Total lysates or IPs were boiled at 95 °C for 3 min, and supernatants were then resuspended in rehydration lysis buffer (RHB; 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% ZOOM carrier ampholyte (pH range 3-10) (Invitrogen), 0.002% bromphenol blue). Two-dimensional PAGE and peptide mass mapping were conducted as described previously (15Ohnuma K. Yamochi T. Uchiyama M. Nishibashi K. Iwata S. Hosono O. Kawasaki H. Tanaka H. Dang N.H. Morimoto C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7743-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Preparation of Lysates or Lipid Raft Fractionation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Stimulated or unstimulated cells were pelleted and lysed with TBSD buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% digitonin, 102-fold diluted protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 102-fold diluted phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and subjected to immunoprecipitation, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. To obtain the lipid raft fraction, purified T-cells (1 × 108) that were stimulated for 10 min with anti-CD3 alone or with anti-CD3 plus NT-Fc were lysed with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture in ice-cold MNE buffer (25 mm MES (pH 6.5) (Sigma), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), and then fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (33Ishii T. Ohnuma K. Murakami A. Takasawa N. Kobayashi S. Dang N.H. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12138-12143Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of the pooled lipid raft fraction, fractionated lipid rafts were lysed at 4 °C for 30 min with 1% N-octyl-β-d-glucoside (Nakalai Tesque) and subjected to immunoprecipitation experiment, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were conducted as described previously (14Ohnuma K. Yamochi T. Uchiyama M. Nishibashi K. Yoshikawa N. Shimizu N. Iwata S. Tanaka H. Dang N.H. Morimoto C.

Nuclear Protein Extraction and DNA-binding Protein Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat cells or transfectants stimulated as indicated, and ELISA-based DNA-binding protein assays for NF-κB p65 were performed using Mercury TransFactor kits (BD Biosciences) as described previously (14Ohnuma K. Yamochi T. Uchiyama M. Nishibashi K. Yoshikawa N. Shimizu N. Iwata S. Tanaka H. Dang N.H. Morimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Statistics—Student's t test was used to determine whether the difference between control and sample was significant (p < 0.05 being significant). We prepared soluble caveolin-1 protein consisting of the putative extracellular N-terminal region or the N-terminal region minus the SCD of human caveolin-1, fused with human IgG1 Fc (NT-Fc or NTΔSCD-Fc, respectively). The schematic diagrams of the full-length human caveolin-1 protein, NT-Fc, NTΔSCD-Fc and Fcγ1 are shown in Fig. 1A. As shown in Fig. 1B, where a band of the recombinant Fc portion of human IgG1 (Fcγ1) was observed at ∼35 kDa under reducing conditions (lane 2), the NT-Fc and NTΔSCD-Fc proteins migrated under reducing conditions predominantly as single bands of 50 and 48 kDa, respectively (lanes 3 and 4). Because immuno-globulins are glycosylated post-translationally, the recombinant Fc fusion proteins produced with mammalian cells had higher a molecular weight in SDS-PAGE than as calculated from their amino acid composition (34Ciccimarra F. Rosen F.S. Schneeberger E. Merler E. J. Clin. Investig. 1976; 57: 1386-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In nonreducing conditions, Fcγ1, NT-Fc, or NTΔSCD-Fc were observed at ∼60, 100, or 90 kDa, respectively (lanes 6-8 in Fig. 1B), indicating that they were expressed as a homodimer. Fcγ1, NT-Fc, and NTΔSCD-Fc were also evaluated by Western blot analysis using anti-human IgG antibody (Fig. 1C). We examined whether the generated NT-Fc fusion protein binds to CD26. For this purpose, we used the Jurkat T-cell line that was stably transfected with full-length human CD26 (J.CD26wt) as described under “Experimental Proc"

Also, the involvement of BCL10 has been suggested via binding to BIR1 of API2 and via its interaction with the immunoglobulin domains of MALT1, present in half of the fusion variants. However, conflicting reports exist concerning their roles in API2·MALT1-induced NF-κB signaling. In this report, streptavidin pulldowns of biotinylated API2·MALT1 fusion variants showed that none of the fusion variants interacted with endogenous BCL10; its role in NF-κB signaling by API2·MALT1 was further questioned by RNA interference experiments. In contrast, TRAF6 was essential for NF-κB activation by all fusion variants, and we identified a novel TRAF6 binding site in the second immunoglobulin domain of MALT1, which enhanced NF-κB activation when present in the fusion protein. Furthermore, inclusion of both immunoglobulin domains in API2·MALT1 further enhanced NF-κB signaling via intramolecular TRAF6 activation. Finally, binding of TRAF2 to BIR1 contributed to NF-κB activation by API2·MALT1, although additional mechanisms involving BIR1-mediated raft association are also important.

Here it is thought that oligomerization of TRAF6 elicits its ubiquitin ligase activity, resulting in polyubiquitination of IKKγ, the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex (15Zhou H. Wertz I.

Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) fully activates the IKK complex, which then triggers phosphorylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of IκB-α, the inhibitor of NF-κB. In this way NF-κB is released as a free complex allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and elicit its transcriptional function. There are several lines of evidence that the API2·MALT1 fusion protein somehow introduces a shortcut in the signaling pathway to NF-κB. Initial experiments in cell lines demonstrated that API2·MALT1 could induce constitutive NF-κB activity (17Lucas P.C. Yonezumi M. Inohara N. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Abazeed M.E. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S.

Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, this was linked to enhanced polyubiquitination of IKKγ in MALT lymphomas (19Zhou H. Du M.Q. Dixit V.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and in transgenic mice (20Baens M. Fevery S. Sagaert X. Noels H. Hagens S. Broeckx V. Billiau A.D. De Wolf-Peeters C. Marynen P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5270-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that the BIR domains of API2 mediate the oligomerization of the MALT1 moiety, which in turn triggers TRAF6 oligomerization activating its ubiquitin ligase activity. However, the interaction of TRAF6 with MALT1 via the two potential TRAF6 binding sites in its C terminus has thus far only been demonstrated via overexpression and colocalization studies (16Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 21Rossman J.S. Stoicheva N.G. Langel F.D. Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Schaefer B.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent report questioned a role for TRAF6 in NF-κB activation by API2·MALT1, as the mutation of both potential TRAF6 binding sites does not affect its signaling potential (19Zhou H. Du M.Q. Dixit V.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, we observed a dominant negative effect on NF-κB activation for the C-terminal TRAF6 binding site mutation (E806A), suggesting an essential role for TRAF6 in NF-κB signaling by API2·MALT1 (20Baens M. Fevery S. Sagaert X. Noels H. Hagens S. Broeckx V. Billiau A.D. De Wolf-Peeters C. Marynen P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5270-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Different API2·MALT1 fusion variants were used in these studies (19Zhou H. Du M.Q. Dixit V.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Baens M. Fevery S. Sagaert X. Noels H. Hagens S. Broeckx V. Billiau A.D. De Wolf-Peeters C. Marynen P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5270-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which might explain the observed differences. In approximately half of the MALT lymphoma cases with t(11;18), the API2·MALT1 protein contains the three N-terminal BIR domains of API2 fused to the C-terminal caspase-like domain of MALT1. Depending on the breakpoint, however, the fusion variants have in addition one or two immunoglobulin (Ig) domains of MALT1, as observed in ∼40 and 10% of the cases, respectively. The Ig domains interact with BCL10, which could explain the enhanced NF-κB activation associated with fusion variants carrying these domains (18Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, overexpressed BCL10 was reported to interact with the first BIR domain of API2 and to synergistically activate NF-κB with API2·MALT1 (22Hu S. Du M.Q. Park S.M. Alcivar A. Qu L. Gupta S. Tang J. Baens M. Ye H. Lee T.H. Marynen P. Riley J.L. Yang X. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The first BIR domain further interacts with TRAF1 and TRAF2, although this interaction then again is apparently not involved in NF-κB activation by API2·MALT1 (23Varfolomeev E. Wayson S.M. Dixit V.M. Fairbrother W.J. Vucic D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29022-29029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanisms by which API2·MALT1 activates NF-κB, we investigated the role of BCL10, TRAF2, and TRAF6 for the different fusion variants. Our data argue against a role for BCL10 in their NF-κB activating potential, although TRAF2 does contribute via its interaction with the first BIR domain of API2. Furthermore, we have demonstrated an essential role for TRAF6 in NF-κB activation by all fusion variants and identified a new TRAF6 binding site in the second Ig domain of MALT1. Both TRAF6 binding sites contribute to NF-κB signaling by MALT1 and API2·MALT1 and seem to enhance NF-κB activation by the API2·MALT1 fusion variant with both Ig domains of MALT1 via intramolecular TRAF6 activation. Constructs—A vector enabling expression of biotinylated proteins was constructed by introducing oligonucleotides encoding the biotinylation (bio) sequence (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) described by Beckett et al. (24Beckett D. Kovaleva E. Schatz P.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) downstream of the N-terminal FLAG epitope in the plasmid pcDNA3.1 (pcD-F-bio). A second vector contained the bio-tag preceded by a flexible linker (SGSSGSSG) C-terminal of the multiple cloning site (pcD-F-bioC). These vectors were used to generate bio-constructs for MALT1 and the API2·MALT1 fusion variants A7M8, A7M5, and A7M3 (fusion of exon 7 of API2 with exons 8, 5, and 3 of MALT1, respectively; see Fig. 1A). The open reading frames of A7M8, A7M5, A7M3, MALT1, and BCL10 were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using long distance PCR (Roche Applied Science). PCR-based mutagenesis was applied to generate MALT1 fragments with deletion of exon 7 (M7d) or mutation of the TRAF6 binding sites (E313A/E316A or M7m and E653E and E806A, separately or combined), which were subcloned into the above mentioned constructs to generate the different mutants. The same strategy was used to generate API2·MALT1 constructs containing the E47A/R48A (ER-AA) TRAF1/2 binding site mutation (25Samuel T. Welsh K. Lober T. Togo S.H. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1080-1090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in their first BIR domain. The open reading frame of the Escherichia coli BirA biotin protein ligase was amplified from genomic DNA via long distance PCR and cloned in the MSCV-FLAG-puromycin vector. Cell Culture—HEK-293T cells, Jurkat T-cells, and SSK41 MALT lymphoma B-cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Monoclonal stable cell lines were generated by electroporating 5 × 106 cells with 20 μg of linearized plasmid DNA (250 V, 960 microfarads; Genepulser Bio-Rad), followed by single-cell dilution and selection with the appropriate antibiotics. As such, monoclonal Jurkat and SSK41 cell lines were generated stably expressing BirA from a pMSCV-FLAG-puromycin vector alone or in combination with a bio-tagged version of MALT1 (Jurkat) and A7M3 or A7M8 (SSK41), respectively, via their expression from a pcD-F-bio-neomycin vector. To mimic antigen receptor stimulation, Jurkat T-cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 ng/ml Ca2+-ionophore (Sigma-Aldrich) for the indicated time. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in NDLB lysis buffer (0,3% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7,6, 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (30 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm Na2MoO4, 5 mm Na4P2O7) and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Gene Silencing, Transfection, and NF-κB Reporter Assays— The following predesigned siRNAs were used for gene knock-down experiments: a mix of AAGGTACTGGAGCCTGAAGGA and AAGGTTGCACAGTCACAGAAT for MALT1, a mix of AAGGGCTGGAAAATTGTTAGA and AAGGACTAAAATGTAGCAGTT for BCL10, and a control siRNA for green fluorescent protein (Ambion). HEK-293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with siRNA duplexes (50 nm) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). After 4 h the medium was refreshed, and cells were transfected as described previously (20Baens M. Fevery S. Sagaert X. Noels H. Hagens S. Broeckx V. Billiau A.D. De Wolf-Peeters C. Marynen P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5270-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NF-κB reporter assays were performed as described previously (20Baens M. Fevery S. Sagaert X. Noels H. Hagens S. Broeckx V. Billiau A.D. De Wolf-Peeters C. Marynen P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5270-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 2 × 106 Traf6+/– and Traf6–/– murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells 5G. Van Loo and M. Pasparakis, unpublished data. were grown in 10-cm Petri dishes and transiently transfected with a total of 5 μg of DNA using Amaxa™ technology (Amaxa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA mixture comprised 500 ng of pActβ-galactosidase, 500 ng of pNFconluc, and 4 μg of specific expression plasmids. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 200 μl of luciferase-lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm 1,2-cyclohexaminediaminetetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). After the addition of substrate buffer to a final concentration of 470 μm luciferin, 270 μm coenzyme A, and 530 μm ATP, luciferase activity was measured in a Topcount microplate scintillation reader (Packard Instrument Co.). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed using the Galactostar reporter gene assay system (Applied Biosystems). Luciferase values were normalized for galactosidase values to correct for differences in transfection efficiency (plotted as luciferase/β-galactosidase). Bio-Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The bioimmunoprecipitation method is described by de Boer et al. (26de Boer E. Rodriguez P. Bonte E. Krijgsveld J. Katsantoni E. Heck A. Grosveld F. Strouboulis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7480-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Briefly a protein of interest containing the biotinylation tag becomes biotinylated in vivo via co-expression of the E. coli BirA biotin protein ligase. After cell lysis in NDLB lysis buffer for 30 min on ice, the biotinylated protein complex is precipitated via binding to paramagnetic streptavidin beads (Dynabeads M-280, Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein precipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and boiled for 10 min at 95 °C in 1× SDS gel loading buffer (with a final concentration of 4% SDS and 300 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Raft purifications were performed as described previously (20Baens M. Fevery S. Sagaert X. Noels H. Hagens S. Broeckx V. Billiau A.D. De Wolf-Peeters C. Marynen P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5270-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cell lysates and precipitated protein complexes were fractionated on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (NuPage, Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare). API2· MALT1 (A7M8, A7M5, and A7M3) and MALT1 were detected with α-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich) or with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the C terminus (residues 731–824) of MALT1 (α-MALT1-C). Antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used for immunodetection of BCL10 (sc-5273), TRAF6 (sc-7221), and TRAF2 (sc-876), respectively. The antibodies against UBC13 (4E11) and phosphorylated IκB-α (Ser32–Ser36, 5A5) was purchased from Invitrogen and Cell Signaling, respectively. NF-κB Activation by API2·MALT1 Does Not Require BCL10—The API2·MALT1 fusion protein containing both Ig domains of MALT1 (A7M3 or case 2; see Fig. 1A) possessed a higher NF-κB activating potential in 293 cells compared with the variant lacking these domains (A7M8 or case 1) (18Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In MALT1, the Ig domains mediate the interaction with BCL10, which is essential for MALT1 to synergistically enhance NF-κB activation with BCL10 (17Lucas P.C. Yonezumi M. Inohara N. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Abazeed M.E. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Seto M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19012-19019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Because the differences in potential of the fusion variants to activate NF-κB correlated with their ability to interact with overexpressed BCL10, it was suggested that BCL10 contributes to NF-κB signaling by the A7M3 fusion variant via binding to its Ig domains (18Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient expression of API2·MALT1 constructs with one (A7M5) or both (A7M3) Ig domains in HEK-293T cells indeed resulted in higher activity of the NF-κB luciferase reporter compared with the A7M8 variant (Fig. 1, A and B). To investigate whether this correlated with their potential to recruit BCL10, we purified protein complexes from HEK-293T cells transiently expressing these API2·MALT1 fusion variants with a biotinylation tag. Co-expression of the E. coli biotin protein ligase BirA allowed in this way the pulldown of biotinylated API2·MALT1 with streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (26de Boer E. Rodriguez P. Bonte E. Krijgsveld J. Katsantoni E. Heck A. Grosveld F. Strouboulis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7480-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of purified API2·MALT1 complexes showed an interaction with endogenous TRAF2 and TRAF6. We could however not co-precipitate endogenous BCL10 with any of the fusion variants, in contrast to the efficient co-purification with a biotinylated MALT1 construct (Fig. 1C). Similarly, deletion of the N-terminal death domain (DD) in MALT1 abolished its interaction with BCL10 (Fig. 1D). As BCL10 did not co-precipitate with the bio-tagged DD alone, this suggested that the DD and the Ig domains of MALT1 cooperate for BCL10 recruitment (Fig. 1E). To exclude a cell type-specific effect, we generated SSK41 MALT lymphoma B-cells with stable expression of both the BirA biotin ligase and bio-tagged A7M8 and A7M3, respectively. Again, we could only identify TRAF2 and TRAF6 but not BCL10 in purified protein complexes (Fig. 1F). Next, RNA interference was used to address the role of BCL10 in NF-κB activation by the A7M3 fusion variant. As shown in Fig. 1G, siRNA against BCL10 effectively knocked down its expression in 293T cells, however this did not affect the potential of the A7M3 fusion to activate NF-κB. Similar results were obtained for A7M8 (Fig. 1H). Partial knockdown of MALT1, on the other hand, increased NF-κB signaling by A7M3, most likely because of the increased levels of “free” TRAF6 otherwise bound to MALT1. Purified MALT1 protein complexes indeed revealed the existence of a preformed BCL10·MALT1·TRAF6 complex in 293T and Jurkat cells, both in the resting condition, as after stimulation of the antigen receptor-signaling pathway to NF-κB (Fig. 1, C and F). Altogether, these data argue against a role for BCL10 in NF-κB activation by the different API2·MALT1 fusion variants. TRAF6 Is Essential for API2·MALT1-mediated NF-κB Activation—Purified protein complexes from HEK-293T and SSK41 cells revealed that the different API2·MALT1 fusion variants all interacted with TRAF2 and TRAF6 (Fig. 1, C and F), suggesting that both TRAF proteins contribute to the NF-κB activating potential of the fusions. Two potential TRAF6 binding sites were identified in MALT1 (T6-C1 = PEETGSY, MALT1 residues 651–657; and T6-C2 = PVETTD, MALT1 residues 804–809 (16Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar); Fig. 2A), but deletion or mutation (E806A) of the most C-terminal site appeared to be sufficient to completely abolish NF-κB activation by A7M8 (20Baens M. Fevery S. Sagaert X. Noels H. Hagens S. Broeckx V. Billiau A.D. De Wolf-Peeters C. Marynen P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5270-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein complexes co-precipitated with bio-tagged A7M8 or the E653A and E806A mutants in HEK-293T cells showed that only the E806A mutant had lost its potential to interact with TRAF6 and to activate the NF-κB reporter (Fig. 2B), confirming the essential role of TRAF6 in A7M8-mediated NF-κB activation. A recent report, however, questioned the involvement of TRAF6 in NF-κB signaling by API2·MALT1 as mutation of both T6-C1 and T6-C2 (E2A) in A7M5 had no effect on NF-κB activation (19Zhou H. Du M.Q. Dixit V.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We therefore wondered whether the E2A mutation disrupted TRAF6 binding in the fusion variants containing one or two Ig domains, and we analyzed protein complexes purified with bio-tagged A7M5/3 and their E2A mutant. Although we did observe a reduction in NF-κB activation, the E2A mutation apparently did not affect binding of TRAF6 with A7M3 (Fig. 2C), suggesting either an indirect interaction or the existence of another TRAF6 binding site in the MALT1 moiety. Because the same results were obtained for A7M5 (data not shown) and in view of the dominant negative effect of the E806A mutation on TRAF6 binding to A7M8, we suspected the second Ig domain (Ig2) of MALT1 to be involved in this additional interaction with TRAF6. Closer examination of its sequence revealed two partial TRAF6 binding consensus sequences just downstream of the Ig2 (TDEAVE, MALT1 residues 311–316; and AVECTE, MALT1 residues 314–319), both located in exon 7 of MALT1 that encodes only 11 amino acids (Fig. 2A). Deletion of these 11 amino acids (M7d) or the double mutation E313A/E316A (M7m) did not inhibit TRAF6 binding but reduced the potential of A7M3 to activate NF-κB by half, suggesting an involvement in NF-κB signaling (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 5). A combination of the E2A mutation with the M7d deletion or the M7m mutation, respectively, completely blocked NF-κB reporter activation by A7M3, which correlated with a complete disruption of TRAF6 interaction (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 6). It was reported previously that deletion of the C-terminal Ig-like domain of MALT1 in an A7M5 construct (del 1 (19Zhou H. Du M.Q. Dixit V.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 425-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)) disrupts its interaction with overexpressed UBC13 and abolishes NF-κB activation, suggesting a crucial role for binding of UBC13 to this Ig-like domain. A similar deletion prevented indeed NF-κB activation by an A7M3 construct (Fig. 2D); however, we could not detect endogenous UBC13 in the purified protein complexes from the different API2·MALT1 fusion variants (Fig. 2, B–D). We noticed however that this deletion not only prevented the interaction of TRAF6 with the C terminus of A7M3 but also disrupted its recruitment to the exon 7 binding site, which could explain the defective NF-κB signaling. Finally, when the A7M3 and A7M8 fusions were expressed in Traf6–/– MEFs, the absence of Traf6 function abolished API2·MALT1-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 2E). Altogether, these data demonstrate that A7M5 and A7M3 can interact with TRAF6 via two distinct binding sites, suggesting that their higher NF-κB activating potential in comparison with A7M8 might result from their ability to recruit two TRAF6 molecules simultaneously. Furthermore, they reveal that TRAF6 is essential for NF-κB activation by all API2·MALT1 fusion variants. Both TRAF6 Binding Sites Contribute to MALT1-mediated NF-κB Activation—The identification of the novel TRAF6 binding site in the Ig2 domain of MALT1 raises the question whether this site is also involved in MALT1-mediated signaling to NF-κB. Purified protein complexes with bio-tagged MALT1 demonstrated an interaction with endogenous TRAF6 in HEK-293T and Jurkat T-cells (Fig. 1, C and F). Similar to A7M3 and A7M5, the interaction between TRAF6 and MALT1 could only be disturbed by the double M7m-E2A mutation, indicating that MALT1 also contains two functional TRAF6 binding sites (Fig. 3, A and B). To find out whether they were both involved in MALT1-mediated signaling to NF-κB, we analyzed the effect of their mutation on the synergism of MALT1 with BCL10 for NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig. 3C, mutation of either one of the TRAF6 binding sites in MALT1 had little effect on the synergism with BCL10, whereas a total block of TRAF6 binding to MALT1 via the double mutation completely abolished the effect of MALT1 coexpression and dropped NF-κB activation to the level of BCL10 expression alone. In conclusion, these data show two distinct TRAF6 binding sites in MALT1 that both contribute to NF-κB signaling. Role for Lipid Raft Association in MALT1-mediated NF-κB A"
https://openalex.org/W1967470619,"The human colonic bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, which plays an important role in maintaining human health, produces an extensive array of exo-acting glycoside hydrolases (GH), including 32 family GH2 glycoside hydrolases. Although it is likely that these enzymes enable the organism to utilize dietary and host glycans as major nutrient sources, the biochemical properties of these GH2 glycoside hydrolases are currently unclear. Here we report the biochemical properties and crystal structure of the GH2 B. thetaiotaomicron enzyme BtMan2A. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that BtMan2A is a β-mannosidase in which substrate binding energy is provided principally by the glycone binding site, whereas aglycone recognition is highly plastic. The three-dimensional structure, determined to a resolution of 1.7Å, reveals a five-domain structure that is globally similar to the Escherichia coli LacZ β-galactosidase. The catalytic center is housed mainly within a (β/α)8 barrel although the N-terminal domain also contributes to the active site topology. The nature of the substrate-binding residues is quite distinct from other GH2 enzymes of known structure, instead they are similar to other clan GH-A enzymes specific for manno-configured substrates. Mutagenesis studies, informed by the crystal structure, identified a WDW motif in the N-terminal domain that makes a significant contribution to catalytic activity. The observation that this motif is invariant in GH2 mannosidases points to a generic role for these residues in this enzyme class. The identification of GH-A clan and GH2 specific residues in the active site of BtMan2A explains why this enzyme is able to harness substrate binding at the proximal glycone binding site more efficiently than mannan-hydrolyzing glycoside hydrolases in related enzyme families. The catalytic properties of BtMan2A are consistent with the flexible nutrient acquisition displayed by the colonic bacterium.

Sugar polymers represent the most abundant source of organic carbon in the biosphere (1Coughlan M.P. Russell G.E. Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Reviews. Intercept, Paris1985: 1-54Google Scholar). Whereas plant structural polysaccharides are important nutrients for organisms living in terrestrial and marine environments, symbiotic prokaryotes that inhabit the human large bowel utilize both dietary and host saccharides as valuable sources of energy and carbon (2Sonnenburg J.L.

Commensurate with this flexibility in nutrient acquisition, the genomes of colonic bacteria, exemplified by the human symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, have revealed a startling array of genes encoding glycoside hydrolases (3Xu J.

Indeed, B. thetaiotaomicron expresses >200 glycoside hydrolases, more than any other prokaryote described to date (3Xu J. Bjursell M.K. Himrod J. Deng S. Carmichael L.K. Chiang H.C. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Science. 2003; 299: 2074-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Significantly, in B. thetaiotaomicron, the vast majority of these enzymes are in glycoside hydrolase families (GHs) 3The abbreviations used are: GH, glycosidase hydrolase; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenolate; PNP, 4-nitrophenolate; CAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethyl-ammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; BtMan2A, B. thetaiotamicron Man2A; CmMan5A, C. mixtus Man5A. 3The abbreviations used are: GH, glycosidase hydrolase; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenolate; PNP, 4-nitrophenolate; CAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethyl-ammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; BtMan2A, B. thetaiotamicron Man2A; CmMan5A, C. mixtus Man5A.

This expansion in exo-GHs is particularly evident in families 2 and 43, in both of which B. thetaiotaomicron has more than 30 members (3Xu J. Bjursell M.K. Himrod J. Deng S. Carmichael L.K. Chiang H.C. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Science. 2003; 299: 2074-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar).GH2 contains over 700 sequences encoding enzymes with a wide spectrum of different exo-acting β-glycosidase activities including β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23), β-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.25), β-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31), and exo-β-glucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.-). Thus far, three-dimensional structures have only been reported for β-galactosidases, notably the Escherichia coli LacZ protein (7Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.J. Dubose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) (but recently also the Arthrobacter sp. C2-2 LacZ homolog (8Skalova T. Dohnalek J. Spiwok V. Lipovova P. Vondrackova E.

Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Sly W.S. Grubb J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). All these three-dimensional structures reveal a catalytic (β/α)8 barrel, typical of the wider clan GH-A glycosidases (10Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The vast majority of GH2 sequences are extended, reflecting a complex modular architecture in which a number of non-catalytic domains are appended to the (β/α)8 barrel catalytic module. Thus far, there have been no structural reports of classical β-mannosidases from family GH2, although the structure of a GH5 exo-β-mannanase, which targets manno-oligosaccharides has been reported by Dias and colleagues in 2004 (11Dias F.M.V.

Within the plant cell wall mannose is located in mannans, the backbone of which consists of a homopolymer of β1,4-linked d-mannopyranose residues, and glucomannan where the backbone comprises a heterogenous sequence of β1,4-linked d-glucose and d-mannose sugars (18Brett C.T. Waldren K. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Chapman and Hall, London1996Google Scholar). Both mannan and glucomannan are frequently decorated with galactosyl residues linked α1,6 to the backbone mannosyl moieties, which may also be acetylated at O-2 and/or O-3 (18Brett C.T. Waldren K. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Chapman and Hall, London1996Google Scholar). As with other plant cell wall polysaccharides (displayed in Fig. 1), the degradation of mannans involves an enzymatic consortium in which endo-mannanases first break down the polysaccharide into smaller oligosaccharides that are themselves further broken down to mannose through the action β-mannosidases (11Dias F.M.V. Vincent F. Pell G. Prates J.A.M. Centeno M.S.J. Tailford L.E. Ferreira L.M.A. Fontes C.M.G.A. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25517-25526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The situation in human N-glycans is potentially more complex, in that a repertoire of α and β exo-acting glycosidases are required to strip the glycan down to its terminal three sugars in which a d-mannosyl residue is linked β1,4 to the GlcNAc-GlcNAc base of the core.Dissecting the mechanism by which B. thetaiotaomicron utilizes sugar polymers as major sources of nutrients is important in understanding how the bacterium is able to colonize the hind gut, where it promotes human health through the modulation of the immune system and by the synthesis of “anti-neoplaisic” molecules such as butyrate (20Kelly D. Campbell J.I. King T.P. Grant G. Jansson E.A. Coutts A.G. Pettersson S. Conway S. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the extensive portfolio of glycoside hydrolases produced by the bacterium could make a significant contribution to the degradation of plant biomass, which continues to be of evolving interest, not least because of the considerable importance of biofuels (21Hill J. Nelson E. Tilman D. Polasky S. Tiffany D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11206-11210Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). Within a mechanistic context enzymes active on β-mannosidase and glycoside hydrolases that cleave α-linked mannosides are particularly interesting as they may use an unusual catalytic itinerary involving a boat-configured transition state (22Davies G.J. Ducros V.M.-A. Varrot A. Zechel D.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 523-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ducros V. Zechel D.L. Murshudov G.N. Gilbert H.J. Szabo L. Stoll D. Withers S.G.

The enzyme is shown to be a classical β-mannosidase, with high activity on mannobiose and aryl β-mannosides (in contrast to exo-β-mannanases (11Dias F.M.V. Vincent F. Pell G. Prates J.A.M. Centeno M.S.J. Tailford L.E. Ferreira L.M.A. Fontes C.M.G.A. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25517-25526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)), although it is unable to accommodate the galactosyl decorations present on plant-derived mannans. The enzyme is also able to remove β-mannosides from Man-β1,4-GlcNAc, found in the core pentasacharide of human N-glycans, consistent with the diversity of mannose-containing polymers presented to the bacterium in the large bowel. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme at a resolution of 1.7 Å reveals a multidomain enzyme in which the active site pocket is housed within the TIM-barrel domain. Site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with sequence comparisons of GH2 enzymes reveals active site residues that confer specificity for terminal mannosides.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning and Expression—Sequence comparisons indicated that open reading frame BT0458 encodes a GH2 mannosidase, defined hereafter as BtMan2A. Using primers detailed under supplementary materials the region of the gene encoding mature BtMan2A (residues 26-839) was amplified from the B. thetaiotaomicron genomic DNA by PCR. The DNA generated was restricted with NdeI and XhoI (sites introduced in the primers employed in the PCR) and cloned into appropriately digested pET28a (Novagen) to generate pLT001. BtMan2A, encoded by pLT001, contains a C-terminal His6 tag. To produce recombinant BtMan2A, E. coli strain BL21 (Novagen) containing pLT001 was cultured to mid-exponential phase at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani media (LB). The culture was then cooled to 16 °C and recombinant enzyme expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 100 μm followed by incubation for a further 16 h at this lower temperature. The mannosidase was then purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, using TALON™ as the column matrix, ion exchange chromatography using a Q12 column, and size exclusion chromatography employing an S200 column (as described in, for example, in Ref. 11Dias F.M.V. Vincent F. Pell G. Prates J.A.M. Centeno M.S.J. Tailford L.E. Ferreira L.M.A. Fontes C.M.G.A. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25517-25526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).To produce seleno-l-methionine BtMan2A the E. coli methionine auxotroph B834(DE3) containing pLT001 was cultured as described following a similar protocol to that described by Charnock et al. (26Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using the induction regime described above. The recombinant protein was purified as described above except all buffers were supplemented with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. All proteins were homogenous, as judged by SDS-PAGE, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the incorporation of seleno-l-methionine into BtMan2A and that the enzyme had not been processed.Construction of Site-directed Variants—Site-directed mutagenesis, employing a QuikChange kit (Stratagene), primers listed in supplementary information, and pLT001 as the template DNA, was used to construct mutants of man2A, encoding active site variants of BtMan2A. All mutants were sequenced using T7 forward and reverse and custom made primers to ensure that only the designed mutation had been introduced into the mannosidase gene.Kinetic Analyses—The activity of BtMan2A was determined at 37 °C in 43.5 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm citric acid (PC) buffer, pH 5.6, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and the appropriate amount of the substrate. Appropriate concentrations of BtMan2A were added to start the reaction, which was monitored at 400 nm during the linear initial phase (<5% of substrate hydrolyzed). The release of 2,4-dinitrophenolate (DNP) from 2,4-dinitrophenyl-β-d-mannopyranoside (DNP-Man) was monitored continuously. When using the substrate 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-mannopyranoside (PNP-Man) as the substrate, 4-nitrophenolate release (PNP) was measured discontinuously. At least four 200-μl aliquots were removed and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 800 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate that increased the pH to 12. The concentration of DNP and PNP produced was determined using a molar extinction coefficient of 15,000 and 10,000, respectively. For kinetic analysis at least six substrate concentrations that straddled the Km were employed and non-linear regression was used to estimate Km and kcat. The activity of BtMan2A against manno-oligosaccharides and mannose-containing polysaccharides (supplied by Megazyme International, Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland, except Man-β1,4-GlcNAc, which was provided by Dextra Laboratories, Reading, UK) was determined as described by Hogg et al. (14Hogg D. Woo E.J. Bolam D.N. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Pickersgill R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31186-31192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) except the reaction was carried out in PC buffer, pH 5.6. The rate of substrate hydrolysis was monitored by Dionex high performance anion-exchange chromatography (27Hogg D. Pell G. Dupree P. Goubet F. Martin-Orue S.M. Armand S. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a substrate concentration <Km (30 μm) enabling kcat/Km to be determined by measuring the rate of substrate hydrolysis. The kcat for mannan hydrolysis was measured using a substrate concentration of 2 mg/ml. To determine the pH optimum of BtMan2A a discontinuous assay was used and 30 μm PNP-Man as substrate and the following buffers: 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.3-6.5; 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0-7.5; 50 mm Bicine, pH 6.5-9.0; 50 mm CAPSO, pH 8.0-10.0; 50 mm CAPS, pH 9.5-11. Temperature and proteinase stability was determined as described by Andrews et al. (28Andrews S.R. Taylor E.J. Pell G. Vincent F. Ducros V.M. Davies G.J. Lakey J.H. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54369-54379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Ki for bis-Tris propane and isofagomine lactam was determined by measuring the Km for PNP-Man at three different concentrations of inhibitor. The enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor for 1 h prior to carrying out the enzyme assays.Crystallization and Data Collection—Pure proteins as judged by SDS-PAGE were concentrated to between 10 and 20 mg/ml and buffer exchanged into water (Sigma) using a Vivaspin 10-kDa cut-off concentrator. The protein was screened using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method together with the Hampton Crystal screen, Crystal screen 2, Hampton PEG/Ion (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA), the CSS Crystal screens I and II, and the PACT premier screen. The 100-nl droplets were formed by the mosquito® (TTP LabTech Ltd, Royston, Herts, UK) liquid handling robot, mixing 50 nl of protein with 50 nl of well solution. Initial crystals were obtained in the PACT premier screen conditions F2 and PEG/Ion screen G5. These conditions were optimized further to improve crystal quality resulting in conditions of either 0.15-0.35 m NaBr and 6-12% PEG 3350, 0.1 m bis-Tris propane, pH 7, or 0.08 - 0.2 m KSCN, and 8-15% PEG 3350,0.1 m bis-Tris propane, pH 7. A cryo-protectant solution was produced by supplementing the mother liquor with an additional 30% (v/v) glycerol. The lath-shaped crystals were harvested in rayon fiber loops then bathed in cryo-protectant solution prior to flash freezing in liquid N2. Selenomethionine crystals were produced in the same manner.Data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) from single crystals at 100 K with a Δφ of 0.5°. Native data were collected at a wavelength of 0.97930 Å over an oscillation range of 200° on ID14-4 using an ADSC Q4R chargedcoupled device detector. Selenium derivative data were collected at a wavelength of 0.9795 Å over an oscillation range of 200° with Δφ of 0.5° on ID23 using a Marmosaic 225 charged-coupled device detector. The appropriate wavelength for data collection at the Se edge, optimized for the fl″ component of the anomalous scattering, was determined using a fluorescence scan.Structure Solution and Refinement—All data were indexed and integrated in MOSFLM (29Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1992: 1-5Google Scholar). All other computing was undertaken using the CCP4 suite unless otherwise stated. Native BtMan2A crystals were found to belong to the space group P21 with the approximate cell dimensions of a = 91.5 Å, b = 116.0 Å, c = 99.2 Å, and β = 113.4° with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion methods. Selenium positions were determined using SHELXD (30Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) and phases subsequently calculated with MLPHARE from the CCP4 suite (31Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). Solvent flattening and phase improvement were carried out in DM (32Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 49: 148-157Crossref Google Scholar) also from the CCP4 suite. 5% of the data were set aside for cross-validation analysis and the behavior of Rfree was used to monitor and guide the refinement protocols. ARP/wARP (33Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar), in conjunction with REFMAC (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13779) Google Scholar), was used to automatically build the sequence into the electron density. Refinement was undertaken in REFMAC with manual correction to the model using COOT (35Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22815) Google Scholar). Coordinates and observed structure factor amplitudes have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank. Figures were drawn with MOLSCRIPT (36Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and BOBSCRIPT (37Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar).RESULTSSelection and Expression of a GH2 β-Mannosidase—To identify a likely B. thetaiotaomicron GH2 β-mannosidase, the sequences of known, characterized β-mannosidases were used for BLAST searches of the UniProt sequence data base. Open reading frame BT0458 (hereafter designated man2A), one of the 32 family GH2 sequences in this organism (identified by the CAZy data base Refs. 4Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar and 5Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar), displayed significant sequence similarity with both characterized and putative GH2 β-mannosidases, exhibiting 34 and 36% identity with the Thermotoga maritima and Thermatoga neopolitana β-mannosidases, respectively.The man2A gene comprises 2592 bp encoding a 864-amino acid protein (BtMan2A) with a Mr of 96,922 in which the 26 N-terminal residues are predicted to comprise a cleavable signal peptide. The man2A gene encoding mature BtMan2A was successfully expressed in E. coli, and the protein was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography to electrophoretic homogeneity (data not shown). The protein had a Mr, determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis, consistent with the predicted size of the processed enzyme (data not shown) indicating that the enzyme was not proteolytically degraded during its expression or subsequent purification.Biochemical Properties of BtMan2A—BtMan2A was screened for catalytic activity using both a series of aryl-glycosides and dyed polysaccharides. The results showed that the enzyme displays no activity against xylose, arabinose, or galactose containing substrates, trace activity against 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside but significant activity against PNP-Man. The enzyme displays no activity against α-D configured glycosides or any dyed polysaccharides. The data were entirely consistent with the designation of BtMan2A as a β-mannosidase displaying no endo-activity. The kinetic parameters of BtMan2A (Table 1 and Fig. 2) show that the enzyme is ∼100,000-fold more active against manno- compared with gluco-configured substrates. Analysis of the reaction products released by BtMan2A from a range of β1,4-linked manno-oligosaccharides showed that mannose and a manno-oligosaccharide with a degree of polymerization of n-1, where n is the degree of polymerization of the substrate, were the initial reaction products demonstrating that the enzyme displays classical exo-activity, releasing mannose from the non-reducing end of polymeric substrates. Even at a manno-oligosaccharide concentration of 1 mm BtMan2A produced equal amounts of mannose and the n-1 product; no oligosaccharides larger than the substrate were produced. Thus, under the conditions used, BtMan2A does not display significant transglycosylating activity, in contrast to many retaining glycosidases (extensively reviewed in Ref. (38Vocadlo D.J. Withers S.G. Glycosidase-catalyzed Oligosac-charide Synthesis. Wiley-VCH GmbH Weinheim, Germany2000Google Scholar)). This may indicate that the +1 subsite (39Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) does not bind mannose tightly and thus an activated water is more likely to be generated in the proximal aglycone region of the active site. The enzyme displays extremely low activity against 61-α-d-galactosyl-mannobiose and 61-α-d-galactosyl-mannotriose (∼40-fold lower activity than against mannobiose and mannotriose, respectively), indicating that decoration of the aglycone region of the substrate located in the +2or +1 subsite can be tolerated, albeit poorly whereas no detectable hydrolysis of the doubly substituted 63, 64-α-d-galactosyl-mannopentaose (Fig. 3 and Table 1) was evident. The specificity of BtMan2A for linear unsubstituted mannans (Fig. 1) and its inability to exhibit any endo-activity explains why the enzyme is only able to produce small amounts of mannose from galactomannan or glucomannan (data not shown).TABLE 1Kinetic properties of wild type and mutants of BtMan2ABtMan2ASubstrateKmkcatkcat/Kmmmin−1min−1/mWild typeDNP-Man8.8 × 10−5 ± 9.3 × 10−612,867 ± 5261.5 × 108 ± 2.8 × 107Wild typePNP-Man1.9 × 10−4 ± 2.1 × 10−57,689 ± 2894.0 × 107 ± 1.4 × 106Wild typeMan-β1,4-GlcNAc5.2 × 104 ± 3.9 × 102Wild typeMannobiose6.0 × 104 ± 1.8 × 103Wild typeMannotriose1.3 × 106 ± 4.7 × 104Wild typeMannotetraose1.9 × 106 ± 6.9 × 104Wild typeMannopentaose5.1 × 105 ± 7.4 × 103Wild typeGal-mannobioseaGal-mannobiose, 61-α-d-galactosyl-mannobiose; mannotriose, 61-α-d-galactosyl-mannotriose.9.3 × 102 ± 3.8 × 102Wild typeGal-mannotrioseaGal-mannobiose, 61-α-d-galactosyl-mannobiose; mannotriose, 61-α-d-galactosyl-mannotriose.2.8 × 104 ± 1.5 × 103Wild typeβ-MannanbThe activity of BtMan2A against the polysaccharides was evaluated using 0.5% substrate and enzyme at a concentration of 40 nm.37.1 ± 2.4Wild typeIvory nut mannanbThe activity of BtMan2A against the polysaccharides was evaluated using 0.5% substrate and enzyme at a concentration of 40 nm.29.9E462APNP-Man1.9 × 10−4 ± 1.5 × 10−55.47 ± 0.192.8 × 104E555APNP-Man1.8 × 10−4 ± 2.8 × 10−50.58 ± 0.0393.3 × 103E462ADNP-Man2.8 × 10−6 ± 7.8 × 10−70.48 ± 0.0361.7 × 105E555ADNP-Man8.9 × 10−5 ± 1.6 × 10−50.11 ± 0.0071.2 × 103N461ADNP-Man1.5 × 10−5"
https://openalex.org/W1969533384,"After crossing the cellular membrane barrier during cell entry, most animal viruses must undergo further disassembly before initiating viral gene expression. In many cases, these disassembly mechanisms remain poorly defined. For this report, we examined a final step in disassembly of the mammalian reovirus outer capsid: cytoplasmic release of the central, δ fragment of membrane penetration protein μ1 to yield the transcriptionally active viral core particle. An in vitro assay with reticulocyte lysate recapitulated the release of intact δ molecules. Requirements for activity in this system were shown to include a protein factor, ATP, and Mg2+ and K+ ions, consistent with involvement of a molecular chaperone such as Hsc70. Immunodepletion of Hsc70 and Hsp70 impaired δ release, which was then rescued by addition of purified Hsc70. Hsc70 was associated with released δ molecules not only in the lysate but also during cell entry. We conclude that Hsc70 plays a defined role in reovirus outer capsid disassembly, during or soon after membrane penetration, to prepare the entering particle for gene expression and replication."

The conferral of light-dependent degradation on a heterologous protein by fusion to cryptochrome may be a useful tool for probing protein function in cell expression systems. Cryptochromes are blue-light photoreceptors found throughout the animal and plant kingdoms (1Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). These proteins were first identified in Arabidopsis (2Lin C. Shalitin D. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 469-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 3Klein T. Lockhart P. Batschauer A. Plant J. 2003; 35: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), where they have been shown to be required for specific light-dependent developmental and circadian entrainment effects. In Drosophila, flies with loss-of-function mutations in cryptochrome exhibit decreased circadian phase-shifting responses to light (4Stanewsky R. Kaneko M. Emery P. Beretta B. Wager-Smith K. Kay S.A.

Rosbash M. Nature. 2000; 404: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY) 2The abbreviations used are: dCRY, Drosophila cryptochrome; TIM, TIMELESS; W, watts. causes increased photosensitivity (6Emery P. So W.V. Kaneko M. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Cell. 1998; 95: 669-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). When expressed heterologously in yeast, dCRY interacts with the circadian clock protein TIMELESS (TIM) in light but not dark; this effect is lost in the cryb mutant, which has a missense mutation in the flavin binding domain (7Ceriani M.F. Darlington T.K. Staknis D. Mas P. Petti A.A. Weitz C.J. Kay S.A. Science. 1999; 285: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 8Rosato E. Codd V. Mazzotta G. Piccin A. Zordon M. Costa R. Kyriacou C.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 909-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In Drosophila Schneider-2 (S2) cells transfected with both dCRY and TIM expression constructs, light induces degradation of both proteins in a dCRY-dependent manner (9Busza A. Emery-Le M. Rosbash M. Emery P. Science. 2004; 304: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that dCRY is a photopigment that undergoes a light-dependent conformational change, allowing it to bind to TIM and also initiating its own degradation. The photocycle and molecular mechanisms of Drosophila cryptochrome photoreceptor function are not presently understood. Here we show that Drosophila cryptochrome can confer light-dependent degradation to a fused heterologous protein. By fusing firefly luciferase to dCRY, we are able to measure the kinetics of light-dependent degradation of cryptochrome as a function of luciferase activity. This has allowed the generation of an action spectrum for Drosophila cryptochrome. Construction of the pAc-luc and pAc-luc-dCRY and pAc-BlastR Constructs—The pAc-Myc-dCRY plasmid (generously provided by the Patrick Emery, University of Massachusetts) consists of a cry cDNA with a 5′ Myc tag, which has been introduced into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pAcV5/HisB (Invitrogen) (9Busza A. Emery-Le M. Rosbash M. Emery P. Science. 2004; 304: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to insert NotI and XhoI, between Myc and CRY, generating the pAc-Myc-dCRY-SDM plasmid. The following primers were used for the site-directed mutagenesis: 5′-AGG ACC TGA ACG CGG CCG CTA ACT ATC CGC TCG AGA TGG CCA CGC-3′ (dCRYSDFP) and 5′-GCG TGG CCA TCT CGA GCG GAT AGT TAG CGG CCG CGT TCA GGT CCT-3′ (dCRYSDRP). For cloning of the luciferase gene, the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) was used as template for PCR with high fidelity Pfu taq polymerase. The following primers were designed to add NotI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined) and remove the stop codon from luciferase to generate the fusion protein: 5′-AGC GGC CGC ATG GAA GAC GCC AAA AAC-3′ (NotI-Luc) and 5′-CTC GAG CAC GGC GAT CTT TCC GCC CTT-3′ (Luc-XhoI). The pAc-luc vector containing full-length luciferase was constructed using the same NotI-Luc forward primer and the following reverse primer, which includes the stop codon: 5′-TCT AGA ATT CAC GGC GAT CTT TCC GCC CTT-3′ (Luc-XbaI). For stable cell line selection, the blasticidin resistance gene was cloned using the pLenti6/V5D-TOPO vector as a template for PCR with high fidelity Pfu taq polymerase. The following primers were used to add appropriate restriction sites (underlined): 5′-GGA ATT CCA TGG CCA AGC CTT TGT C-3′ (EcoRI-BlastR) and 5′-GCT CTA GAG CTT AGC CCT CCC ACA C-3′ (BlastR-XbaI). The three PCR products were cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into TOP10 cells. The pAc-luc-dCRY plasmid was generated by digesting pCR-Blunt II-TOPO-NotI-Luc-XhoI and pAc-Myc-dCRY-SDM with NotI and XhoI restriction enzymes, gel extraction, and ligation of the products. The pAc-luc plasmid was generated by digesting pCR-Blunt II-TOPO-NotI-Luc-XbaI and pAc-Myc-dCRY-SDM with NotI and XbaI restriction enzymes, gel extraction, and ligation of the products. pAc-BlastR was generated by digesting pCR-Blunt II-TOPO-EcoRI-BlastR-XbaI and pAc-Myc-dCRY-SDM with EcoRI and XbaI restriction enzymes, gel extraction, and ligation of the products. Positive clones were sequenced prior to development of stable cell lines. The C-terminal deletion mutant was incidentally generated during the course of cloning and verified by sequencing. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—D.Mel-2 Schneider S2 insect cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Drosophila serum-free medium until they reached 80–90% confluence in a 75-cm2 flask. Cells were co-transfected with pAc-luc-dCRY and pAc-BlastR or pAc-luc and pAc-BlastR at the recommended 19:1 ratio using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were allowed to recover for 48 h at 28 °C and transferred to Schneider's complete Drosophila medium for selection with blasticidin at a concentration of 25 μg/ml. After 2 weeks under selection, the cultures were subjected to serial dilutions to obtain clonal stable cell lines. The resulting clonal lines were grown in 25-cm2 flasks until confluent and screened for the highest levels of luciferase activity in the dark. Luciferase Assays—Under dim red 10-W safety light, cells were divided into 1.5-ml aliquots in clear Eppendorf tubes and foil-wrapped. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 700 μl of Drosophila M3 medium (without supplement) to maximize light transmission through the cell culture medium. Cells were transferred to 0.5-ml clear PCR tubes and placed in a 28 °C PCR block. A xenon lamp was placed above the PCR block, and the light intensity at each point in the block was measured by calibrated radiometer prior to light pulse. Tube lids were open during light treatment, allowing direct irradiation of cells in medium. At each time point, 50 μl of cells were removed from the tube and centrifuged, and the pellets were frozen until all samples were collected. Pellets were resuspended in 1× cell lysis reagent (Stratagene), and luciferase levels were measured using the Luciferase assay kit (Promega). Western Blotting—D.Mel-2 Schneider S2 insect cells were cultured in a 25-cm2 flask and co-transfected with pAc-Myc-dCRY and pAc-luc-dCRY at the recommended 1:1 ratio using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were allowed to recover for 48 h at 28 °C, transferred to 0.5-ml clear PCR tubes, and placed in a 28 °C PCR block. Tubes were pulsed with bright white light for the specified time periods, and 100 μl of cells were removed every 10 min and centrifuged, and the pellets were frozen until all samples were collected. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 1× cell lysis reagent (Stratagene) with 1× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) and boiled for 5 min. Cell extracts were loaded onto NuPAGE 7% Tris-acetate gels (Invitrogen) and run at 150 V for 50 min. Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer apparatus at 15 V for 20 min with subsequent Ponceau staining to confirm adequate blotting of proteins. Blots were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated overnight with α-dCRY primary antibody (Alpha Diagnostic, product number CRYD13-A) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Blots were washed in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween-20 and incubated for 1 h with a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween-20. Blots were washed, and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) kit was used for horseradish peroxidase detection. Irradiance-response Curve and Action Spectra Analysis— The pAc-luc-dCRY stable S2 cell line was pulsed for 30 min with different irradiances of monochromatic light with 10-nm bandwidth filters as described previously (10Suri V. Zuwei Q. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Each sample was normalized as a percentage of time 0 to allow for direct comparison between samples. For each wavelength, an irradiance-response curve was fitted via the Zettler-modified Naka-Rushton equation: y = a · x/(c + x) (using SigmaPlot 2001) (13Bogyo M. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 269-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hendil K.B. Harmann-Petersen R. Tanaka K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 31-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The irradiance-response curves were used to calculate the irradiance level required to obtain 50% of maximum degradation (IR50) for each wavelength. The percentage of sensitivity was calculated as 100 × ((10IR50/U390)/(10IR50/Uλ)), where the IR50 at 390 nm represents the wavelength of maximum sensitivity. Preparation of Cell-free Extract—Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was placed on ice. Lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P40, 1× Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) was added, and cells were vortexed and subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle to lyse cells. Cell Viability Assays—For each of the samples pulsed for 30 min with different irradiances of monochromatic light, 20 μl of cells were placed in a 96-well plate containing 100 μl of CellTiter-Blue reagent (Promega). Cells were incubated at 28 °C for 2–3 h, and cell viability was calculated as a 560/590 ratio of fluorescence per the manufacturer's protocol. Busza et al. (9Busza A. Emery-Le M. Rosbash M. Emery P. Science. 2004; 304: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) previously demonstrated light-dependent dCRY degradation by transfecting S2 cells with a Myc-tagged cryptochrome expression construct and quantifying dCRY protein levels by Myc immunoprecipitation and Western blot, probing with an α-dCRY antibody. This technique is limited in its sensitivity and temporal resolution. To establish a more readily quantifiable assay for light-dependent cryptochrome degradation, we fused a full-length firefly luciferase cDNA to the N terminus of full-length Drosophila cryptochrome. The N terminus was chosen because of the established effects of C-terminal deletions and mutations on dCRY degradation efficiency (8Rosato E. Codd V. Mazzotta G. Piccin A. Zordon M. Costa R. Kyriacou C.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 909-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Busza A. Emery-Le M. Rosbash M. Emery P. Science. 2004; 304: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 11Dissel S. Codd V. Fedic R. Garner K.J. Costa R. Kyriacou C.P. Rosato E. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Additionally, we generated a fusion protein with a partial truncation of the C terminus of dCRY (deleting amino acids 528–542), as well as a control construct containing luciferase only (pAc-luc) (Fig. 1). Stable S2 cell lines were selected for pAc-luc and pAc-luc-dCRY constructs. We initially subjected the pAc-luc and pAc-luc-dCRY stable cell lines to a 1-h light treatment with a Xenon light source at an irradiance of 250 W/m2 (Fig. 2A). Temperature was held constant during light exposure. The LUC-dCRY fusion protein exhibited a rapid decrease in luciferase activity with 49.03 ± 3.89% activity remaining after 5 min and a maximal loss of activity to 16.62 ± 0.29% of original activity within 1 h. In contrast, samples maintained in the dark exhibited 98.45 ± 1.97 and 84.17 ± 1.23% of original levels at 5 and 60 min, respectively. The light-treated pAc-luc luciferase-only construct behaved as dark-treated LUC-dCRY and did not show light-dependent degradation, indicating that the luciferase itself is not light-sensitive. Viability assays demonstrated that no cell death was associated with light exposure, indicating that protein degradation was not due to nonspecific photic toxicity (data not shown). Luciferase activity recovered following placement of cells in the dark with >85% of initial activity seen 2 h after replacement in the dark (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the luciferase-cryptochrome fusion proteins recapitulated native degradation after light pulse, we transiently co-transfected S2 cells with pAc-Myc-dCRY and pAc-luc-dCRY and collected cells every 10 min following light exposure of 250 W/m2. Western blots were prepared and probed with anti-dCRY antibody. Signal for both dCRY and LUC-dCRY showed time-dependent attenuation (Fig. 2C). Loss of LUC-dCRY signal occurred ∼10 min earlier than loss of dCRY signal (40 min after exposure versus 50 min after exposure), suggesting that the fusion protein is slightly less stable under light exposure than native dCRY protein. Previous studies have strongly suggested that dCRY is degraded by proteasomal mechanisms in vivo and in vitro (9Busza A. Emery-Le M. Rosbash M. Emery P. Science. 2004; 304: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 12Lin F.J. Song W. Meyer-Bernstein E. Naidoo N. Sehgal A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7287-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Degradation of LUC-dCRY could be partially blocked by the addition of 100 μm MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor (13Bogyo M. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 269-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), prior to the light pulse (Fig. 2A). Proteasome-mediated protein degradation can occur in cell-free extracts that preserve proteasome function (14Hendil K.B. Harmann-Petersen R. Tanaka K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Light treatment of whole cell extracts showed light-dependent loss of luciferase activity (Fig. 3), consistent with a proteasomal mechanism. The slower time course of degradation observed in cell-free conditions is consistent with that seen in other in vitro proteasome assays (14Hendil K.B. Harmann-Petersen R. Tanaka K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that the C terminus of dCRY plays an important role in light-dependent degradation of TIM and in the intrinsic stability of dCRY protein (7Ceriani M.F. Darlington T.K.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A 19-amino-acid deletion in the cryM mutation, for example, results in constitutively lowered expression in vivo and in vitro (9Busza A. Emery-Le M. Rosbash M. Emery P. Science. 2004; 304: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We generated a construct expressing luciferase fused to a C-terminal truncated dCRY protein lacking the final 15 amino acids of cryptochrome (LUC-dCRYΔ528) and studied its light-dependent degradation in transient transfection experiments. We found that this protein can be expressed in the dark in S2 cells and undergoes light-dependent loss of luciferase activity (Fig. 4). Interestingly, this mutant protein appeared more sensitive to light than the full-length version; the truncated mutant showed ∼30% more degradation to 5 mW/cm2 white light intensity after 5 min than the full-length fusion protein (Fig. 4). The action spectrum of a photopigment describes the photoactivity of the pigment as a function of the wavelength of light (15Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 31-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In a simple system, the action spectrum corresponds with the absorption spectrum of the photoactive pigment. The full action spectrum for animal cryptochrome has not been established. pAc-luc-dCRY stably transfected S2 cells were treated for 30 min with 10 nm bandpass monochromatic light of different irradiances. Irradiance was corrected for medium absorption at each wavelength (Fig. 5). Wavelengths ranging from 350 to 550 nm were tested (Fig. 6). For each wavelength, the irradiance-response curve for protein degradation was fitted via the Zettler-modified Naka-Rushton equation (16Naka K.I. Rushton W.A.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1966; 185: 536-555Crossref Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 17Naka K.I. Rushton W.A.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1966; 185: 587-599Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 18Zettler F. Z. Vergl. Physiol. 1969; 64: 432-449Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The set of irradiance-response curves (Fig. 7A) and corresponding action spectrum (Fig. 7, B and C) for light-dependent dCRY function showed maximum loss of luciferase activity in the UV-A wavelengths from 350 to 400 nm with a plateau in activity between 430 nm and 450 nm and rapid fall-off in sensitivity at wavelengths longer than 500 nm, which were nearly 4 orders of magnitude less effective than UV-A wavelengths.FIGURE 6Irradiance-response relations for pAc-luc-dCRY fusion protein after 30-min light pulses with monochromatic light.

Given the previous demonstration by Busza et al. (9Busza A. Emery-Le M. Rosbash M. Emery P.

Because of the high sensitivity and precision of measurement of luciferase activity, the kinetics and photoresponsiveness of light-dependent protein degradation can be assessed with high resolution. We find that light-dependent degradation of the luciferase-dCRY fusion protein is rapid with 50% loss of luciferase activity observed within 5 min of bright light exposure and 80% degradation seen after 1 h. This is more rapid and complete than that observed by Busza et al. (9Busza A. Emery-Le M. Rosbash M. Emery P. Science. 2004; 304: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), who noted ∼20% degradation at 10 min and 30% degradation at 1 h. The more rapid degradation observed in our assay may be a function of lighting or culture conditions. In our direct comparison of native dCRY and LUC-dCRY, we found ∼25% faster degradation of the larger fusion protein after light exposure but found nearly complete degradation of both by 50 min after light exposure. It is possible that the larger fusion protein is more unstable than the native dCRY (in both light and dark); alternatively, it is possible that the fusion protein undergoes more rapid degradation only following light exposure. We do not know at present whether other aspects of dCRY function (such as binding to TIM) are retained by the LUC-dCRY fusion protein. Busza et al. (9Busza A. Emery-Le M. Rosbash M. Emery P. Science. 2004; 304: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) generated an equal intensity action spectrum for light-dependent degradation of dCRY in S2 cells, measuring the relative efficacy of single light irradiance for each wavelength. This yielded a relatively flat spectrum from 400 to 500 nm with a sharp drop-off between 500 and 650 nm. UV wavelengths were not tested. Ahmad et al. (19Ahmad M. Grancher N. Heil M. Black R.C. Giovani B. Galland P. Lardemer D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) generated an action spectrum for Arabidopsis cryptochrome function by comparing the action spectra of cryptochrome mutant and overexpressing lines. These showed peak activity at ∼440 nm but a relatively flat spectrum from 380 to 450 nm. However, the presence of potential screening pigments in plants may have shifted the relative action spectrum in this study. The present study provides the first complete action spectrum for Drosophila cryptochrome function in vitro. This spectrum strongly resembles reported action spectrum for entrainment of the circadian activity rhythm in adult so1;gl60j flies (20Helfrich-Förster C. Edwards T. Yasuyama K. Wisotzki B. Schneuwly S. Stanewsky R. Meinertzhagen I.A. Hofbauer A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9255-9266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these flies, loss of all opsin-mediated photoreception reveals the contribution of cryptochrome to circadian entrainment. The in vitro action spectrum also strongly resembles the reported absorption spectra for heterologously expressed cryptochrome from Vibrio cholerae (21Worthington E.N. Kavakli I.H. Berrocal-Tito G. Bondo B.E. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39143-39154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and human (22Hsu D.S. Zhao X. Zhao S. Kazantsev A. Wang R.P. Todo T. Wei Y.F. Sancar A. Biochem. 1996; 35: 13871-13877Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In both absorption spectra, maximal absorption is seen in the UV-A with significant plateau in the near blue region of 400–450 nm. The action spectrum for light-induced degradation of the luciferase-dCRY fusion protein similarly shows maximal activity in the UV; indeed, the IR50 for light-induced degradation is in the range of 1011 photons/cm2/s. Bouly et al. (24Tu D.C. Batten M.L. Palczewski K. Van Gelder R.N. Science. 2004; 306: 129-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have recently determined the absorption spectrum of Arabidopsis cry1 protein. Consistent with the present work, they find increasing absorption with short wavelength. In Arabidopsis cry1, the magnitude of “plateau” phase seen between 400 and 500 nm was strongly dependent on the length of time the protein was irradiated with broad spectrum light, suggesting that the redox state of the flavin chromophore may determine the contour of this region of the spectrum. Availability of an action spectrum for animal cryptochrome function may thus help constrain and identify the redox state of the native chromophore in situ. Although we were not able to generate sufficiently bright light to measure full irradiance-response curves for light of wavelengths longer than 510 nm, the slope of the irradiance response functions for light-mediated degradation of luciferase-dCRY appeared to flatten at longer wavelengths (for example, 510 nm). The principle of univariance for photopigments suggests that activation of a photopigment by a photon should be identical regardless of the wavelength of that photon; the action spectrum results from the relative probability of photon absorption. For a univariant pigment, the slope of the irradiance-response function will thus remain constant across wavelengths. The current action spectrum is potentially consistent with a pigment that absorbs multiple photons. The recent work of Bouly et al. (23Bouly J-P. Schleicher E. Dionisio-Sese M. Vandenbussche F. Van Der Straeten D. Bakrim N. Meier S. Batschauer A. Galland P. Bittl R. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 10.1074/jbc.M609842200PubMed Google Scholar) on Arabidopsis cryptochrome 1 has demonstrated that green light antagonizes blue light activation of cryptochrome. These authors suggest a three signaling state model for cryptochrome function wherein the inactive cryptochrome binds the FAD chromophore, blue light leads to a radical FADH-containing signaling state, and subsequent absorption of a longer wavelength photon results in conversion to an FADH- state, which does not signal and reverts to FAD in the dark. Further studies are necessary to determine whether animal cryptochrome shows a similar, multiphoton absorption photocycle. This action spectrum should be useful in assessing the potential role for cryptochromes in other light-induced phenomena in animals. The embryonic chicken ocular iris sphincter muscle, for example, shows light-dependent constriction even when dissected from the retina (24Tu D.C. Batten M.L. Palczewski K. Van Gelder R.N. Science. 2004; 306: 129-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This activity is vitamin A-independent, but sensitivity decreases with siRNA- or anti-sense-mediated knock-down of chicken cryptochromes 1 and 2. The action spectrum for this activity closely matches the action spectrum found for light-dependent degradation of Drosophila cryptochrome. Similarly, the action spectrum for light-mediated Per2 induction in zebrafish also shows significant sensitivity in the UV with a reduced sensitivity at wavelengths greater than 450 nm and nearly complete loss of activity by 500 nm, consistent with the current observed cryptochrome-dependent action spectrum (25Cermakian N. Pando M.P. Thompson C.L. Pinchak A.B. Selby C.P. Gutierrez L. Wells D.E. Cahill G.M. Sancar A. Sassone-Corsi P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 844-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The role of the C terminus in Drosophila cryptochrome remains somewhat obscure. In plants, the C terminus by itself mediates a constitutive light response (26Yang H-Q. Wu Y.-J. Tang R.-H. Liu D. Liu Y. Cashmore A.R. Cell. 2000; 103: 815-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar); conversely, in Drosophila, C-terminal deletions result in constitutive light activity (12Lin F.J. Song W. Meyer-Bernstein E. Naidoo N. Sehgal A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7287-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In yeast two-hybrid experiments, C-terminal deleted CRY binds TIM in light and dark (8Rosato E. Codd V. Mazzotta G. Piccin A. Zordon M. Costa R. Kyriacou C.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 909-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Flies expressing this allele in lieu of wild type demonstrate a phenotype similar to wild-type flies kept in constant light, again suggesting constitutive activity for C-terminal deleted protein. The crym mutation was discovered in a screen for flies exhibiting free-running behavior in constant light conditions (9Busza A. Emery-Le M. Rosbash M. Emery P. Science. 2004; 304: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In S2 cells, the CRYM protein is expressed at ∼20-fold lower levels than wild type; the CRYM protein is nearly undetectable even in the dark in fly heads. Although CRYM can bind TIM, it does so in both light and dark. The LUC-dCRYΔ528 mutant is a slightly shorter deletion than CRYM (15 versus 19 amino acids) but could be expressed successfully in S2 cells. It is possible that the luciferase fusion confers additional stability to the combined protein when compared with CRYM alone. However, LUC-dCRYΔ528 was more light-sensitive than the full-length protein, supporting the notion that the C terminus does confers additional stability to the cryptochrome protein. In addition to being a valuable reagent for studying the photobiology of insect cryptochrome, the luciferase-CRY fusion protein also demonstrates that light-dependent degradation can be conferred upon a light-insensitive protein by fusion to cryptochrome. This may be a useful technique for studies of protein function as it may allow for specific proteins to be reversibly and rapidly degraded using ultraviolet or visible blue light."
https://openalex.org/W1990130270,"Alternative ways to control caterpillar pests and reduce the use of pesticides in apple orchards are in the interest of the environment, farmers and the public. Great tits have already been shown to reduce damage under high caterpillar density when breeding in nest boxes in an experimental apple orchard. We tested whether this reduction also occurs under practical conditions of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), as well as Organic Farming (OF), by setting up an area with nest boxes while leaving a comparable area as a control within 12 commercial orchards. We showed that in IPM orchards, but not in OF orchards, in the areas with breeding great tits, apples had 50% of the caterpillar damage of the control areas. Offering nest boxes to attract insectivorous passerines in orchards can thus lead to more limited pesticide use, thereby adding to the natural biological diversity in an agricultural landscape, while also being economically profitable to the fruit growers."

The interferon response to viral infection provides a first line of host defense against infectious agents (1Malmgaard L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24: 439-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Among a myriad of cellular effects, this induced interferon pathway can cause inhibition of host translation, slowing viral protein expression and progeny proliferation (2Peel A.L. J. Neuropathol.

Korth M.J. Katze M.G. Clin. Diagn Virol. 1998; 10: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Activated by the binding of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), PKR responds to viral genomic contamination within the host cell (4Gale Jr., M. Katze M.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 78: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 5Maitra R.K. McMillan N.A. Desai S. McSwiggen J. Hovanessian A.G. Sen G. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Virology. 1994; 204: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Activated PKR regulates protein synthesis via efficient substrate phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) at Ser-51, inhibiting the guanidine nucleotide exchange activity of the eIF2 heterotrimeric complex and resulting in the inhibition of translational initiation (4Gale Jr., M. Katze M.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 78: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). PKR also plays a critical role in cellular processes such as the induction of apoptosis, immune response, regulation of dsRNA-dependent transcription, and cellular growth (6Saunders L.R. Barber G.N. FASEB. J. 2003; 17: 961-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Human PKR is a 551-residue enzyme consisting of three distinct regions, each with specific activities. The N-terminal region contains two conserved dsRNA-binding motifs (dsRBD1/2) responsible for dsRNA binding. The NMR structure of dsRBD1/2 revealed two highly similar dsRBD domains connected by a 23-residue disordered linker (7Nanduri S. Carpick B.W. Yang Y. Williams B.R. Qin J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5458-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). High affinity PKR-dsRNA interaction requires both dsRBDs of PKR, as well as specific structural and length requirements of the activator dsRNA (8Kim I. Liu C.W. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9McCormack S.J. Ortega L.G. Doohan J.P. Samuel C.E.

The C-terminal region of PKR is a serine-threonine kinase domain that is responsible for phosphorylation activity and substrate recognition. The crystal structure of the kinase domain in complex with eIF2α has revealed an ATP-binding pocket required for phosphotransfer, two phosphorylation sites required for activation (Thr-446 and Thr-451), and a putative substrate recognition site (11Dar A.C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Cell. 2005; 122: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal regions of PKR are connected by a 80-residue flexible linker rich in Ser and Asn residues, which may propagate the dsRNA activation signal from the dsRBD1/2 domain to the kinase domain. A large body of biochemical and biophysical data has defined the basic features of PKR function. Most importantly, latent PKR undergoes autophosphorylation upon dsRNA binding, which greatly increases kinase activity (12Taylor D.R. Lee S.B. Romano P.R. Marshak D.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Esteban M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6295-6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J.

Virol. 1995; 69: 5195-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dimerization of PKR may be required for efficient kinase activation (15Vattem K.M. Staschke K.A. Wek R.C. Eur. J.

Cell. 2005; 122: 901-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) as both dsRNA binding and the phosphorylation state of the protein may affect dimerization equilibrium (18Lemaire P.A. Lary J. Cole J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Despite these data, the mechanism of PKR kinase activation remains unresolved. An autoinhibition model has been proposed in which the latent form of PKR remains inactive in the cell through intramolecular association of dsRBD1/2 with the kinase domain (15Vattem K.M. Staschke K.A. Wek R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3674-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this model, binding of dsRNA to dsRBD1/2 relieves autoinhibition, allowing the released kinase domain to participate in activation and substrate phosphorylation. In support of this model, NMR experiments with isolated domains suggest that the second RNA-binding domain interacts with the kinase domain (19Nanduri S. Rahman F. Williams B.R. Qin J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5567-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Li S. Peters G.A. Ding K. Zhang X. Qin J. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10005-10010Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, recent reports have also contradicted the autoinhibitory model, implying that dsRNA binding does not directly relieve inhibition caused by kinase domain interaction (21Lemaire P.A. Tessmer I. Craig R. Erie D.A. Cole J.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9074-9084Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22McKenna S.A. Kim I. Liu C.W. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1270-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here we performed biochemical and biophysical experiments to provide a molecular framework for the activation of PKR. NMR of full-length PKR revealed that the three distinct regions of PKR behave as individual entities in solution, with no detectable evidence of interdomain autoinhibition. These findings are buttressed by NMR investigations of both RNA-bound and phosphorylated forms of full-length PKR, as well as complimentary studies of autophosphorylation kinetics, reaction molecularity, and RNA release. The results presented here support an updated mechanism of PKR activation in which RNA binding and autophosphorylation modulate protein self-association and activity. Sample Preparation—Expression and purification of full-length human PKR and the dsRBD1/2 construct are as described previously (22McKenna S.A. Kim I. Liu C.W. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1270-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Full-length PKR mutant constructs (PRKK296R, PKRT446A, PKRT451A, and PKRT446A/T451A) were generated using site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type plasmid and were expressed and purified as for the wild-type protein. PKR constructs of kinase domain (PKR252-551) and kinase plus linker (PKR169-551) were subcloned from full-length PKR template using standard PCR techniques. 2H15N-PKR was expressed in deuterated M9 minimal media containing 70% (v/v) D2O (Cambridge Isotopes), supplemented with 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 90 μm FeSO4, 0.01% (w/v) yeast extract, 1 mg of thiamine-HCl, 1 mg of biotin, 2.5 g of d-glucose, and 0.5 g of 15N-NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotopes) per liter of media. Phosphorylated PKR (PKRP) was generated by incubating wild-type full-length human PKR (15 μm) in the presence of ATP (1 mm) and MgCl2 (2 mm) at 30 °C for 2 h in a buffered solution containing Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and purified in the same buffer on a Super-dex 26/60 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare). RNA-generated phosphorylated PKR (PKRTAR-P) was made by incubating wild-type full-length human PKR (1 μm) and HIV TAR RNA in the presence of ATP (1 mm) and MgCl2 (2 mm) at 30 °C for 2 h in a buffered solution containing Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and purified as described above. RNA samples were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase as described previously (22McKenna S.A. Kim I. Liu C.W. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1270-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Lukavsky P.J. Puglisi J.D. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2004; 10: 889-893Google Scholar) using a BsaI restriction site at the 3′ end of the transcript to terminate transcription. Predicted secondary structures of dsRNAs employed are shown elsewhere (22McKenna S.A. Kim I. Liu C.W. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1270-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Kinetics—All autophosphorylation assays were performed as described previously (22McKenna S.A. Kim I. Liu C.W. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1270-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Kinetics experiments were analyzed using Berkeley Madonna X (version 8.3.12) software to fit the differential equations that describe either a unimolecular or a bimolecular model of PKR activation. We solved the differential equations for E*(t), the rate of formation of phosphorylated PKR product, using the Runge-Kutta algorithm. In constructing the bimolecular model, the following assumptions were incorporated: (i) PKR must be RNA-bound to become phosphorylated at low concentrations, (ii) phosphorylated PKR (E*) binds PKR·TAR complex (ER) with higher affinity than latent PKR, (iii) no change in affinity for ATP occurs when comparing EREA and ERE*A species, (iv) conversion to product is irreversible (k6 and k7), and (v) the on-rate of reactions controlled by K1, K2, K3, K4 and K5 are diffusion-limited (6 μm-1 min-1). Reverse rate constants were calculated based on established dissociation constants. Apparent Km and kcat values were calculated by globally fitting data at all complex concentrations simultaneously, as described elsewhere (24Wang Z.X. Wu J.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 947-952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At complex concentrations above 4 μm, data were excluded from further analysis as significant inhibition of autophosphorylation was observed. Dynamic Light Scattering—Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments were performed at 30 °C with a DynaPro-801 molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions Co.). Protein samples were passed through a 0.22-μm Millex-GV syringe filter (Millipore) to remove particulates. A total of 50 data points were collected at 10-s intervals for each sample. Using the DYNAMICS (version 6.0) software package, the hydrodynamic radius, apparent molecular weight, and polydispersity were determined on the basis of an autocorrelation analysis of scattered light intensity data. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectral data were obtained using a Varian Unity INOVA 800MHz spectrometer at 30 °C. All two-dimensional 1H, 15N-TROSY HSQC spectra were acquired using the sensitivity-enhanced gradient pulse scheme in Biopack (Varian Inc.) using 1H and 15N sweep widths set to 12,001 Hz and 3242 Hz, 2048 points, and delay recovery of 3.5 s (25Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2439) Google Scholar). Samples contained 2H15N-PKR in NMR buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 90%/10% H2O/D2O, pH 6.7). Spectral processing and assignment of all 1H, 15N-TROSY HSQC were performed using the software packages NMRPipe (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and NMRView (27Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). The total average change in backbone amide 1H and 15N chemical shift, Δδtotal, was determined according to the following equation Δδtotal=(0.1Δδ15N)2+(Δδ1H)2(Eq.1) where Δδ15N and Δ δ1H are the chemical shift changes in ppm for a given residue relative to free dsRBD1/2 or kinase domain. Native Gel Shift Mobility Assay—All samples were prepared as described previously (22McKenna S.A. Kim I. Liu C.W. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1270-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with the exception that a sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl was employed. PKR Activation Is a Bimolecular Process—The primary goal of this study was to determine the mechanism for activation of PKR in the framework of a molecular model. The activation of PKR was first characterized using the kinetics of autophosphorylation. We have established a kinase activation assay that follows the time course of PKR autophosphorylation in the presence of a dsRNA activator, HIV-TAR dsRNA (TAR). A buffered reaction containing [γ-32P]ATP, PKR, and TAR is incubated for a set time, quenched with EDTA, separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE, and quantified by autoradiography. The kinetics of the activation process was monitored over a 20-fold concentration range of PKR·TAR complex between 0.2 and 4 μm. A simple unimolecular or bimolecular reaction scheme was used to fit the kinetic data obtained. A sigmoidal buildup of product is observed at all concentrations examined with a lag phase prior to maximal rates of autophosphorylation, characteristic of autocatalytic processes (Fig. 1A). The experimental data are well fit by a second order, bimolecular mechanism, whereby autophosphorylation occurs in trans between one PKR and a second bound PKR. Furthermore, these curves were non-superimposable once corrected for total protein concentration, thereby excluding a unimolecular reaction mechanism (Fig. 1B). The time required for activation is significantly reduced at higher PKR·TAR concentrations. By globally fitting all kinetic data simultaneously, an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and catalytic center activity (kcat) for the autophosphorylation reaction was determined to be 4.1 ± 0.7 μm and 0.7 ± 0.3 min-1, respectively. Both values are within the boundaries of similar kinase autophosphorylation reactions (24Wang Z.X. Wu J.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 947-952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments described here were performed with purified PKR·TAR complex, but similar results were obtained if the reagents were mixed without complex purification or if an alternative dsRNA activator was employed (VAI-AS, data not shown). dsRNA Binding and Phosphorylation of PKR Lead to Increased PKR Self-affinity—The kinetics reported above support a bimolecular mechanism for autophosphorylation of PKR. To examine the PKR association state during activation, we determined apparent molecular weights (Mr) by DLS of complexes containing either wild-type or catalytically inactive (K296R) PKR. DLS under various conditions was performed at 2 μm PKR, which is a concentration greater than that expected in vivo (28Lasky S.R. Jacobs B.L. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11087-11093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The validity of the approach was confirmed by reasonable Mr determinations of both TAR (∼20 kDa) and PKR (∼81 kDa) (Fig. 1C). The molecular masses determined are slightly higher than predicted because of the elongated shape of both TAR and PKR. These results show that PKR in its latent form behaves as a monomeric protein at low μm concentrations. The addition of an excess of ATP to a sample containing PKR does not result in any change in hydrodynamic radius, indicating that ATP binding does not drastically change the conformation of PKR (Fig. 1C). TAR binding to PKR increases its apparent Mr by ∼20 kDa, and again, either ATP or ADPPNP binding does not change the DLS data. The addition of MgCl2 and ATP to the PKR·TAR complex does not significantly alter the apparent Mr of the PKR·TAR complex alone. The catalytically inactive mutant, K296R, which remains monomeric under activating conditions, behaves similarly to wild-type PKR. PKR·dsRNA complexes were next assembled and incubated under PKR autophosphorylation conditions. The apparent molecular weights of complexes were then determined by DLS at specific time intervals. A 1:1 complex of PKR·TAR in the absence of reagents required for activation (ATP and MgCl2) does not change Mr as a function of time (Fig. 1D, blue). The addition of ATP and MgCl2 caused a time-dependent reduction in molecular mass from 104 to 84 kDa (Fig. 1D, black), which corresponds to a transition from fully bound PKR·TAR complex to a free PKR and TAR mixture. To confirm that the reduction in molecular weight was specific for activation, an equimolar complex of the catalytically inactive K296R and TAR dsRNA was assembled. This complex demonstrated no significant change in Mr in either the presence (Fig. 1D, red) or the absence (data not shown) of ATP and MgCl2. To probe the formation of bimolecular complexes for the different species involved in PKR activation, we determined the concentration dependence of dimer formation for wild-type PKR, PKR·TAR complex, and PKRP. We employed DLS at various PKR concentrations (1-80 μm). PKR alone (Fig. 1E) or PKRK296R (data not shown) show only a minor increase in Mr at high concentration, whereas a significant increase in apparent Mr is observed upon increasing the concentration of PKRP. The increase of ∼30 kDa is less than would be expected for a dimer of two PKR molecules (136 kDa). PKR dimerization may yield in a non-spherical complex, or more likely, the values observed may reflect an equilibrium between monomer and dimer. A 1:1 PKRP-PKR complex gave a similar increase in Mr when compared with PKRP alone, indicating a similar affinity for phosphorylated and dephosphorylated enzyme. A 1:1 PKR·TAR complex gave an intermediate increase in Mr when compared with PKR or PKRP, indicating that dsRNA-bound PKR has a greater self-association constant than unbound PKR but a weaker one than phosphorylated PKR. The hydrodynamic behavior of PKR and complexes determined by DLS was confirmed using size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1F). At all concentrations examined, latent PKR elutes as a 74-kDa protein. Identical results were observed for PKRK296R (data not shown). At lower concentrations (5 μm), PKRP is monomeric, whereas increased concentration (30 μm) leads to the identification of a 128-kDa species, which we ascribe to PKR dimerization. This molecular mass is in good accordance with that determined by DLS (123 kDa). Latent Form of PKR Exists in an Open Conformation—To explore the interplay between the RNA-binding (dsRBDs) and kinase domains, we performed NMR studies on full-length PKR. The 15N-TROSY HSQC spectra of latent full-length 2H15N-PKR revealed a sufficiently resolved spectrum, which allowed spectral assignments of a large number of amide resonances (Fig. 2). The previously reported individual unbound dsRNA-binding domains (dsRBD1/2, residues 1-169) (29Nanduri S. Carpick B. Yang Y. Williams B.R. Qin J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the K296R kinase domain (residues 252-551) (30Gelev V. Aktas H. Marintchev A. Ito T. Frueh D. Hemond M. Rovnyak D. Debus M. Hyberts S. Usheva A. Halperin J. Wagner G. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were used to assign resonances from the full-length protein by spectral superimposition. In total, 137 out of 169 resonances in the RNA-binding domains (81%) were unambiguously assigned based upon spectral overlay with the unbound dsRBD1/2 resonances, with the remaining 32 resonances (19%) not assigned due to peak overlap in the crowded spectral region (7.5-8.5 ppm). Spectral overlay with the assigned, unbound kinase domain (residues 252-551) revealed a superimposition that allowed for the unambiguous assignment of 82 out of 299 kinase resonances (27%), predominantly in the outlying regions of the spectra. The 80-residue linker region between the dsRBDs and kinase domain is unassigned as it is unstructured in solution, present with the bulk signal in the overlapping region of the spectra (supplemental Fig. 8). The near perfect spectral superimposition of free full-length PKR with either dsRBD1/2 (Fig. 3A) or the kinase domain resonances (not shown) suggests that the individual domains in the context of full-length PKR are behaving independently in solution. Resonances from both dsRBD1 and dsRBD2 are not significantly perturbed in full-length PKR (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the RNA-binding and kinase domains do not significantly interact in latent PKR. The conformation of dsRNA activator RNA complexes with full-length PKR was monitored in a similar manner using NMR. The chemical shift perturbations to full-length PKR upon formation of a 1:1 complex with TAR occur predominantly within the RNA-binding domains (Fig. 3B). Significant perturbations occur to resonances within both dsRBD domains (i.e. Leu-25, Leu-30, Lys-136) with minimal perturbations to kinase resonances (i.e. Lys-261, Gln-365, Ile-503) (Fig. 3D). Resonances within the dsRBD domains (1-169) closely match those previously reported for a dsRBD1/2·TAR complex (8Kim I. Liu C.W. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), indicating that the binding of dsRBD1/2 to TAR in the presence or absence of the kinase domain is similar. A chemical shift perturbation map highlights this effect (Fig. 3E) as the PKR kinase resonances display superimpositions versus the unbound protein. Nearly identical results were obtained when an alternate dsRNA activator was employed (VAI-AS, data not shown). These results show that the kinase domain does not directly participate in the binding of dsRNA and suggest that no large conformational change within the kinase domain occurs upon activator binding. To provide complementary information on full-length PKR·TAR interaction, we examined the NMR spectrum of TAR in the RNA-protein complex (supplemental Fig. 9). The imino proton resonances of free TAR and TAR bound to the dsRBD1/2 have been previously assigned (8Kim I. Liu C.W. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The imino proton NMR spectrum is relatively free from overlap with protein resonances. A comparison of the imino spectra of TAR bound to full-length PKR and TAR bound to dsRBD1/2 shows very similar chemical shifts. These data further support the hypothesis that bound RNA activators do not interact directly with kinase domain or interdomain linker. Characterization of the Phosphorylated State of PKR—To probe the hypothesis that RNA binding affects PKR self-association affinity, we characterized the autophosphorylation properties of PKR truncations in which the dsRBDs or dsRBDs and linker domains were removed (Fig. 4A). As expected, only full-length PKR supports RNA-mediated autophosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Truncations containing only the kinase domain (PKR252-551) or kinase domain plus interdomain linker (PKR169-551) do not autophosphorylate in either the presence or the absence of dsRNA at nanomolar concentrations. RNA activators do not bind to either PKR252-551 or PKR169-551 at μm concentrations (data not shown). The addition of the PKR169-551 and dsRBDs in trans did not result in autophosphorylation. To test the role of dsRBDs and linker in PKR self-association, we examined RNA-independent autophosphorylation of PKR truncation mutants. PKR autophosphorylation occurs at high protein concentrations in the absence of activator RNA in a concentration-dependent manner with complete phosphorylation occurring at concentrations >4 μm (Fig. 4C). At protein concentrations greater than μm concentrations, both the PKR252-551 and the PKR169-551 truncations autophosphorylate to some extent in an RNA-independent fashion. PKR lacking both the dsRBDs and the interdomain linker (PKR252-551) demonstrates minimal autophosphorylation, even at extremely high protein concentrations. PKR lacking only the dsRBDs with intact linker autophosphorylates significantly (∼ 70% of full-length PKR), suggesting that the linker contributes to favorable protein-protein interactions leading to activation. To further examine the properties of phosphorylated PKR, we produced phosphorylated PKR (PKRP) in an RNA-independent fashion. Phosphorylated PKR is separated from ATP and Mg2+ using size exclusion chromatography and purifies as two overlapping peaks; this correlates with monomer and dimer species (data not shown). No such equilibrium exists for latent PKR. We have also purified PKRTAR-P using a similar approach. Wild-type PKR, PKRP, and PKRTAR-P were used both as substrates for autophosphorylation and as kinases capable of trans-phosphorylating wild-type PKR (Fig. 4D). After a 15-min incubation, minimal phosphorylation of PKRP is observed when incubated in the presence of TAR activator, indicating that PKRP is unresponsive to dsRNA and does not further phosphorylate itself under these conditions. PKRP efficiently trans-phosphorylates wild-type latent PKR as a substrate. A 1:1 PKR·TAR complex is also an efficient substrate for trans-autophosphorylation by PKRP, indicating that dsRNA binding to PKR does not block phosphorylation. Trans-autophosphorylation of PKR by PKRP occurs at a 20-fold faster rate than dsRNA-mediated autophosphorylation. PKRTAR-P behaves identically to PKRP in the assay. Finally, PKRP is capable of stoichiometric trans-phosphorylation of latent PKR when compared with the extent of dsRNA-mediated autophosphorylation. Thus, purified PKRP serves as an extremely potent activator of latent PKR. PKR mutations affect substrate activity for trans-autophosphorylation by PKRP (Fig. 4E). As expected, wild-type PKR serves as an efficient substrate, whereas PKRP does not. A PKR derivative containing a catalytically inactive mutation in the ATP-binding site, PKRK296R, is also phosphorylated efficiently by PKRP, indicating that a functional ATP-binding and active site is not required in a substrate for phosphorylation. We observe no significant phosphorylation of the isolated dsRBD1/2. Finally, mutations at either or both of two key phosphorylat"

https://openalex.org/W1969207770,"The optimal context for translation initiation in mammalian species is GCCRCCaugG (where R = purine and ""aug"" is the initiation codon), with the -3R and +4G being particularly important. The presence of +4G has been interpreted as necessary for efficient translation initiation. Accumulated experimental and bioinformatic evidence has suggested an alternative explanation based on amino acid constraint on the second codon, i.e., amino acid Ala or Gly are needed as the second amino acid in the nascent peptide for the cleavage of the initiator Met, and the consequent overuse of Ala and Gly codons (GCN and GGN) leads to the +4G consensus. I performed a critical test of these alternative hypotheses on +4G based on 34169 human protein-coding genes and published gene expression data. The result shows that the prevalence of +4G is not related to translation initiation. Among the five G-starting codons, only alanine codons (GCN), and glycine codons (GGN) to a much smaller extent, are overrepresented at the second codon, whereas the other three codons are not overrepresented. While highly expressed genes have more +4G than lowly expressed genes, the difference is caused by GCN and GGN codons at the second codon. These results are inconsistent with +4G being needed for efficient translation initiation, but consistent with the proposal of amino acid constraint hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1966705749,"Adipose tissue is a source of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and circulating HGF levels have been associated with elevated body mass index in human. However, the effects of HGF on adipocyte functions have not yet been investigated. We show here that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes HGF stimulates the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-dependent protein kinase B (PKB) activity, AS160 phosphorylation, Glut4 translocation, and consequently, glucose uptake. The initial steps involved in HGF- and insulin-induced glucose uptake are different. HGF enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1, leading to the recruitment of the p85-regulated subunit of PI 3-kinase, whereas p85 was exclusively recruited by IRS1 in response to insulin. In adipocytes rendered insulin-resistant by a long-lasting tumor necrosis factor α treatment, the protein level of Gab1 was strongly decreased, and HGF-stimulated PKB activation and glucose uptake were also altered. Moreover, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with thiazolidinedione, an anti-diabetic drug, enhanced the expression of both HGF and its receptor. These data provide the first evidence that in vitro HGF promotes glucose uptake through a Gab1/PI 3-kinase/PKB/AS160 pathway which was altered in tumor necrosis factor α-treated adipocytes.

White adipose tissue is the main site of energy storage; glucose and free fatty acids are transported into the adipocytes and stored as triacylglycerols. Glucose transport is largely induced by insulin, which stimulates the translocation of the glucose transporters Glut 4 and to a lesser extent Glut 1 from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane (1Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3935) Google Scholar).

White adipose tissue might be implicated in these complications through the secretion of a number of bioactive peptides and proteins, generally known as adipokines. Indeed, white adipose tissue is a source of hormones, cytokines, acute phase proteins, and growth factors including epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor, nerve growth factor, and also hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In fact, HGF is expressed and secreted by mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes (10Rahimi N. Saulnier R. Nakamura T. Park M. Elliott B. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and human adipose tissue (11Fain J.N. Madan A.K. Hiler M.L. Cheema P. Bahouth S.W.

The role of the local production of HGF in adipocyte functions has not yet been investigated. The HGF/HGF receptor pathway is indirectly involved in glucose transport. HGF could regulate the expression of glucose transporters in β-cells (16Roccisana J. Reddy V. Vasavada R.C. Gonzalez-Pertusa J.A. Magnuson M.A. Garcia-Ocana A. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2090-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and after massive small bowel resection (17Kato Y. Yu D. Schwartz M.Z. J. Pediatr. Surg. 1998; 33: 13-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). HGF also enhances the glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways of energy production in murine mammary cancer cells (18Kaplan O. Firon M. Vivi A. Navon G. Tsarfaty I. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, at present nothing is known about the metabolic role of HGF in adipocytes. HGF mediates its effects via a specific receptor. The HGF receptor is a cell surface glycoprotein composed of one extracellular α-subunit and one transmembrane β-subunit. Binding of HGF to its receptor stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity of the β-subunit that leads to receptor autophosphorylation and to the membrane recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular signal transducers. Two-phosphorylated tyrosines (Tyr-1349 and Tyr-1356) in the C-terminal tail of the HGF receptor β-subunit bind multiple SH2-containing transducers such as PI 3-kinase, the adaptor protein Grb2, and the docking protein Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) (19Comoglio P.M.

Mice were housed at the animal facility of the Faculty of Medicine (Nice, France). Mice were maintained under a 12-h light: 12-h dark cycle and had free access to water and food. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and epididymal fat pads were removed and frozen-clamped in liquid nitrogen. Principles of laboratory animal care were followed, and the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine approved the animal experiments. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown in 35- or 100-mm dishes in DMEM, 25 mm glucose, and 10% calf serum and induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described previously (23Gual P.

Briefly, 2 days after confluence, medium was changed for DMEM, 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with isobutylmethylxanthine (0.5 mm), dexamethasone (0.25 μm), rosiglitazone (10 μm), and insulin (5 μg/ml). The medium was removed after 2 days and replaced with DMEM, 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with rosiglitazone (10 μm), and insulin (5 μg/ml) for 2 other days. Then cells were fed every 2 days with DMEM, 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used 9–18 days after the beginning of the differentiation protocol. Before each experiment 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake—After serum starvation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated or not with wortmannin (100 nm) for 20 min or with TNFα (50 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cells were then washed with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4) and incubated for 10 min in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 1.25 mm CaCl2.

Results were normalized for protein content measured by BCA assay. Western Blotting and Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—After serum starvation 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated or not with TNFα (50 ng/ml) for 24 h. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were then incubated with HGF (100 ng/ml) or insulin (0.5 nm) for different periods of time as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were subsequently washed twice with ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm pyrophosphate) before solubilization for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm pyrophosphate, proteases inhibitors, and 1% Triton X-100). Lysates obtained after centrifugation (15 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C) were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with appropriate antibodies preadsorbed on protein-G-Sepharose. After washes with lysis buffer, immune pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% resolving gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with saline buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 320 mm NaCl) containing 4% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature and blotted overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies at the dilution indicated by the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. In some cases the membrane was stripped for 30 min at 50 °C in 62 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS and reprobed with the indicated antibodies. Measurement of PI 3-Kinase Activity—After serum starvation 3T3-L1 adipocytes were either left untreated or incubated with HGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min. Cell lysates were successively immunoprecipitated with anti-Gab1 and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Thereafter, immune pellets were washed twice with each of the following buffers: 1) PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 200 μm Na3VO4, 2) 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m LiCl, and 200 μm Na3VO4, and 3) 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 μm Na3VO4. The PI 3-kinase assay was performed directly on the immune pellets as described previously (24Gual P. Gonzalez T. Gremeaux T. Barres R. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26550-26557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of sonicated l-α-phosphatidylinositol in 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, were added to the immune pellets, and the reaction was started by the addition of 25 μl of a reaction mixture consisting of 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 80 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 20 min the reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 μl of 4 n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1). The organic phase was extracted and applied to a silica gel thin layer chromatography plate. After the separation of lipids by thin layer chromatography using a CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:8.8:4.4) solvent system, phosphatidylinositol phosphate was visualized by autoradiography. Preparation of Plasma Membrane Lawns, Immunofluorescence, and Image Analysis—The 3T3-L1 cells were grown on glass coverslips and differentiated as described above. After serum starvation the 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer and incubated for 10 min in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 1.25 mm CaCl2. Cells were then either left untreated or stimulated with HGF (100 ng/ml) or insulin (0.5 nm) for 20 min. Plasma membrane lawns were prepared as previously described (25Mari M. Monzo P. Kaddai V. Keslair F. Gonzalez T. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Cormont M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, after 2 washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were fixed with 0.55 mg/ml poly-l-lysine for 1 min at 4 °C and then swollen by three successive rinses with a hypotonic buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 70 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA). The swollen cells were sonicated in the hypotonic buffer supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and proteases inhibitors, and the bound membrane sheets were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 4% calf serum. Thereafter, plasma membrane lawns were incubated with anti-Glut1 or anti-Glut4 antibodies (5 μg/ml in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature and washed 3 times 10 min with blocking buffer. They were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies and wheat germ agglutinin-Texas Red to normalize. After three 10-min washes with blocking buffer, the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol onto glass slides. The plasma membrane lawns were analyzed with an Axiovert 200 microscope using a Plan-Neofluar 40 × 1.3 numeral aperture oil objective (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Images were acquired using a cooled digital camera (CoolSnap HQ, Roper Scientific Princeton Instruments, Evry, France), and quantification was made using Metamorph image analysis software with auto-threshold detection of pixels (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA) as described previously (25Mari M. Monzo P. Kaddai V. Keslair F. Gonzalez T. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Cormont M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Real-time Quantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNAs from 3T3-L1 cells and mouse white adipose tissue were isolated using the RNAble total RNA extraction kit (Eurobio, France) and TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), respectively. cDNA was synthesized using the Standard Two-step RT-PCR-&GO™ kit (MP Biomedicals Europe) from 1 μg of total RNA in a final volume of 100 μl. Real time quantitative PCR was performed in duplicate with the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system and SYBRGreen dye (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers were designed using Primer Express program (Applied Biosystems). The list of sequences used for primers is available upon request ([email protected]). The reaction mix consisted of 12.5 μl of qPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR® green I (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), 400 nm forward and reverse primers, and 5 μl of 1/10 cDNA in a final volume of 25 μl. PCR conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Amplification of specific transcripts was confirmed by melting curve profiles generated at the end of the PCR program. The mRNA levels of genes of interest (R) were normalized to mRNA levels of 36B4: ΔCtR = CtR – Ct36B4. The relative amount of interest mRNA between the 3T3-L1 cells or two groups of mice is given by 2–ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt = (ΔCtR of untreated cells) – (ΔCtR of treated cells) or ΔΔCt = (ΔCtR of obese mice) – (mean of ΔCtR of lean mice), respectively. Calculation and Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. The statistical difference between mRNA levels in obese and lean mice was determined with the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test using the ΔCt of each group. Other data were statistically analyzed using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. The Gene Expression of HGF Was Increased in Adipose Tissue from Obese Diabetic Mice—We first examined whether HGF and HGF receptor were differentially expressed in white adipose tissue from lean and obese diabetic mice. Total RNAs were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of lean db/+ mice and obese diabetic db/db mice, and the gene expression levels of HGF and HGF receptor were determined using real-time quantitative PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, the HGF gene expression was significantly increased in adipose tissue from obese diabetic db/db mice compared with lean controls, whereas the gene expressions of HGF receptor were unchanged. We then evaluated the gene expression levels of HGF and its receptor in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 1B, HGF was strongly expressed in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, and its receptor was much more expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To secure the quality of the cell differentiation, aP2 was used as a marker of adipocyte differentiation and was found to be predominantly expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). HGF Stimulated Glucose Uptake in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—We then examined whether HGF was able to induce glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Cells were incubated with different concentrations of HGF (from 12.5 to 200 nm) for 20 min, and deoxyglucose uptake was measured. HGF treatment resulted in a significant increase in deoxyglucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal effect at 100 ng/ml (∼3-fold increase) (Fig. 2). By comparison, 0.5 nm insulin induced a 6-fold, and 100 nm insulin induced a 12-fold increase in glucose uptake (data not shown). HGF Enhanced Glut4 Translocation in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Glucose transport is dependent on the translocation of specific glucose transporters, including Glut1 and Glut4, from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane (3Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of HGF on the translocation of both Gluts, plasma membrane lawns were prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes incubated with or without HGF (100 ng/ml) or insulin (0.5 nm) for 20 min, and the amount of plasma membrane-associated glucose transporters was analyzed by immunofluorescence with specific antibodies. As previously described (3Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 5Patel N. Huang C. Klip A. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 451: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), insulin stimulation was mainly associated with the translocation to the plasma membrane of Glut4. Whereas insulin at 0.5 nm enhanced the translocation of Glut4 but not Glut1 (Fig. 3), a supraphysiological concentration of insulin (100 nm) stimulated the translocation of both glucose transporters (data not shown). HGF also significantly increased (∼3-fold) Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane without any effect on Glut1 (Fig. 3). Activation of PI 3-Kinase Was Required for HGF-induced Glucose Uptake in the 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—It is well established that activation of PI 3-kinase is necessary for insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation and glucose transport (3Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 5Patel N. Huang C. Klip A. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 451: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Gual P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Diabetes Metab. 2003; 29: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested whether PI 3-kinase activation was also required for HGF effect. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (wortmannin, 100 nm) before HGF stimulation (100 ng/ml), and deoxyglucose uptake was measured. We observed that inhibition of the PI 3-kinase activity by wortmannin abolished HGF-induced glucose uptake (Fig. 4A), indicating that glucose uptake in response to HGF is completely dependent on the PI 3-kinase pathway. Among the PI 3-kinase effectors, PKB and its substrate AS160 regulate the insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation in adipocytes (4Dugani C.B. Klip A. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1137-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To investigate whether HGF also promoted PKB and AS160 phosphorylation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with or without HGF (100 ng/ml) or insulin (0.5 nm) for 10 min, and the phosphorylation levels of PKB and AS160 were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphospecific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4B, HGF, like insulin, induced the phosphorylation of PKB and AS160. Thus, activation of the PI 3-kinase/PKB/AS160 pathway played an important role in the HGF-stimulated glucose transport. HGF Stimulated the PI-3 Kinase Activity Mainly via Gab1 in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—It has been reported in several cell lines that the majority of the HGF-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity is associated with the docking protein Gab1 (20Rosario M. Birchmeier W. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 328-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 22Furge K.A. Zhang Y.W. Vande Woude G.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5582-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In contrast, the insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity is mainly associated with IRS1, although the insulin receptor can also phosphorylate Gab1 in fibroblasts and hepatocytes (27Holgado M.M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 28Bard-Chapeau E.A. Hevener A.L. Long S. Zhang E.E. Olefsky J.M. Feng G.S. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We, therefore, attempted to assess the relative contribution of Gab1 and IRS1 to recruit the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase upon HGF or insulin stimulation. Gab1 and IRS1 were immunoprecipitated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated or not with HGF (100 ng/ml) or insulin (0.5 nm) for 10 and 20 min. Their tyrosine phosphorylation levels and the association of p85 were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-p85 antibodies, respectively. As seen in Fig. 5, A and B, HGF treatment led to a large increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and the recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. In contrast, in response to insulin, Gab1 was weakly tyrosine-phosphorylated and did not recruit the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. Whereas no phosphorylation of IRS1 was observed upon HGF stimulation, insulin elicited, as expected, the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 leading to the recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 5A). Taken together these findings indicated that the Gab1/PI 3-kinase complex was stimulated in response to HGF, whereas the IRS1·PI 3-kinase complex was triggered upon insulin stimulation. Because PI 3-kinase could be directly recruited by the HGF receptor, we therefore assessed the relative contribution of Gab1 in the HGF-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with HGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min. Gab1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were successively immunoprecipitated from the total lysates, and the PI 3-kinase activity associated to the immune pellets was determined. Although HGF induced a ∼4-fold increase in PI 3-kinase activity associated to Gab1, a low amount of activity remained associated to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins after Gab1 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6). This indicates that most of the PI 3-kinase activity was associated to Gab1 upon HGF stimulation.FIGURE 6HGF-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity mainly via Gab1. After serum starvation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated without or with HGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min. Cell lysates were successively incubated for 3 h at 4°C with anti-Gab1 antibodies and then with anti-phosphotyrosine (α-pY) antibodies as indicated. PI 3-kinase activity was determined on the immune pellets by incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylinositol and separation of phospholipids by thin layer chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative autoradiograph (A) and the means ± S.D. of two independent experiments in duplicate (B) were shown. IP, immunoprecipitate; PI-3P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chronic TNFα Treatment of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Induced an HGF Resistance State—Previous studies have shown that prolonged TNFα treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes causes a state of insulin resistance leading to a strong decrease in IRS1 protein levels, insulin-induced PKB activation, and glucose uptake (29Arner P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). We, therefore, determined whether HGF could still mediate its effect in insulin resistant adipocytes. Cells were pretreated with TNFα (50 ng/ml) for 24 h before stimulation with HGF (100 ng/ml) or insulin (0.5 nm) for 20 min, and deoxyglucose uptake was then measured. Although TNFα treatment induced a significant increase in the basal glucose transport, the HGF and insulin effects on glucose transport were markedly reduced (33 ± 10 and 62 ± 6% of inhibition, respectively) (Fig. 7A). The impairment of HGF effect was correlated with a strong decrease in Gab1 protein levels and HGF-stimulated PKB phosphorylation (Fig. 7B), indicating that adipocytes rendered insulin resistant by TNFα lost their sensitivity to HGF. Rosiglitazone Treatment Increased HGF and HGF Receptor Gene Expression in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Because thiazolidinedione, an anti-diabetic drug, decreased the expression of TNFα in adipose tissue, prevented its inhibitory effects in 3T3-L1 adipocyte (29Arner P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 30Houstis N. Rosen E.D. Lander E.S. Nature. 2006; 440: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar), and increased the expression of HGF receptor in hepatocytes (31Tomita K. Azuma T. Kitamura N. Nishida J. Tamiya G. Oka A. Inokuchi S. Nishimura T. Suematsu M. Ishii H. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we investigated its effect on the expression of HGF and HGF receptor in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 8, the expression levels of HGF and its receptor were ∼3-fold increased after the treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with rosiglitazone (100 nm) for 48 h. This suggested that the benefic effects of thiazolidinedione (TZD) on glucose homeostasis could be associated not only with the improvement of insulin signaling but also with the enhancement of HGF signaling. In the present study we have shown that the gene expression of HGF is strongly increased in adipose tissue from obese diabetic mice compared with lean mice. In 3T3-L1 cells, HGF was predominantly expressed in fibroblasts compared with adipocytes, and HGF enhanced glucose uptake and lipogenesis (data not shown) in adipocytes. These results could suggest that the local production of HGF, mainly secreted by the fibroblasts, could regulate the functions of the adipocytes. In favor of this, it has been reported that a large part of the HGF release (>90%) could be attributed to the nonfat cells (11Fain J.N. Madan A.K. Hiler M.L. Cheema P. Bahouth S.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2273-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar) such as preadipocytes, fibroblasts, macrophages, and endothelial cells (11Fain J.N. Madan A.K. Hiler M.L. Cheema P. Bahouth S.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2273-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 32Rehman J. Traktuev D. Li J. Merfeld-Clauss S. Temm-Grove C.J. Bovenkerk J.E. Pell C.L. Johnstone B.H.

Ogihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, HGF was also expressed to a lesser extent by 3T3-L1 adipocytes, suggesting an autocrine loop in adipocytes in addition to paracrine effects from HGF produced in stromal cells. After secretion, HGF has to be cleaved to be active (36Kataoka H. Miyata S. Uchinokura S. Itoh H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It seems to be the case since HGF secreted by the adipose tissue stimulated the growth of a HGF receptor-expressing mouse mammary carcinoma (10Rahimi N. Saulnier R. Nakamura T. Park M. Elliott B. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and promoted tube formation of vascular endothelial cells in vitro (37Saiki A. Watanabe F. Murano T. Miyashita Y. Shirai K. Int. J. Obes. 2006; 30: 1676-1684Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HGF belongs to the adipokines that are present in blood at very low concentrations (0.7 ng/ml in lean patients, 2.5 ng/ml in morbidly obese patients, 5 ng/ml in mice) (13Rehman J. Considine R.V. Bovenkerk J.E. Li J. Slavens C.A. Jones R.M. March K.L. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2003; 41: 1408-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, in adipose tissue explants a large secretion of HGF occurs compared with serum concentration (11Fain J.N. Madan A.K. Hiler M.L. Cheema P. Bahouth S.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2273-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since HGF could be retained with extracellular matrix in the producing tissue, its local concentration could be much greater than circulating levels. Thus, although the circulating level of HGF is low, the large production of active HGF by adipose tissue could have a local role. HGF and insulin stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via a mechanism exclusively or mainly dependent on the PI 3-kinase activity, respectively. However, insulin and HGF activated the PI 3-kinase through different docking proteins; IRS1 in response to insulin and Gab1 upon HGF stimulation. Whereas insulin weakly stimulated the phosphorylation of Gab1, we did not detect the recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. In agreement with this, it has been reported that the insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activity was mainly associated with IRS1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Interestingly, a large part of this activity was associated with Gab1 in undifferentiated fibroblasts (27Holgado M.M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). This suggests a different role of Gab1 in insulin signaling depending on cell type. The role of Gab-1 in glucose uptake has already been reported. The microinjection of anti-Gab-1 antibodies strongly inhibits osmotic shock-induced Glut 4 translocation without altering insulin effect (38Janez A. Worrall D.S. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26870-26876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that osmotic shock-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 led to glucose uptake via a mechanism independent of the PI 3-kinase activity (23Gual P. Shigematsu S. Kanzaki M. Gremeaux T. Gonzalez T. Pessin J.E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43980-43986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the phosphorylation of Gab1 in response to HGF mainly activated the PI 3-kinase/PKB/AS160 pathway, leading to the subsequent glucose uptake. This indicates that HGF could activate different signaling pathways dependent on Gab1, but activation of the PI 3-kinase played a critical role in HGF-stimulated glucose transport. Therefore, the activation of Gab1 dependent pathways could be a good target to enhance glucose uptake in adipocytes in insulin resistance and diabetes. It was indeed not the case since the HGF signaling pathway was also altered in adipocytes treated with TNFα. In these insulin-resistant adipocytes, the amount of Gab1 was decreased and correlated with an impairment of the HGF-stimulated PKB activation and glucose uptake. The partial correction of the insulin resistance has been reported after the treatment with TZD, an anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic drug. TZD inhibits the secretion of cytokines such as TNFα by the adipose tissue and prevents its inhibitory effect in vitro (29Arner P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 30Houstis N. Rosen E.D. Lander E.S. Nature. 2006; 440: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that we have determined that TZD also enhanced the gene expression of both HGF and HGF receptor in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, Saiki et al. (37Saiki A. Watanabe F. Murano T. Miyashita Y. Shirai K. Int. J. Obes. 2006; 30: 1676-1684Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have recently reported the increase in HGF protein expression after TZD stimulation. In vivo the treatment of rat with TZD increased hepatic HGF receptor expression and induced its tyrosine phosphorylation (31Tomita K. Azuma T. Kitamura N. Nishida J. Tamiya G. Oka A. Inokuchi S. Nishimura T. Suematsu M. Ishii H. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with TZD increased the plasma HGF levels (37Saiki A. Watanabe F. Murano T. Miyashita Y. Shirai K. Int. J. Obes. 2006; 30: 1676-1684Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Whereas further studies are required to determine the direct link between activation of HGF signaling and improvement of metabolic parameters, the benefic effects of TZD on glucose homeostasis could be associated not only with the improvement of insulin signaling but also with the enhancement of HGF signaling. The secretion of HGF by adipose tissue could, therefore, contribute to elevated serum HGF in obesity, whereas its role in obesity has not yet been identified. We have shown here that the production of HGF by adipose tissue could play a local role because it stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. The insulin mimetic effect of HGF is dependent on different early proximal signaling events from those activated by insulin. However, the role of local production of HGF in adipose tissue growth should also be investigated in a future issue. The assistance of T. Gonzalez and T. Grémeaux is greatly acknowledged.

https://openalex.org/W1994697836,"Interleukin-13 (IL-13), a Th2 cytokine, plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis of bronchial asthma via IL-13 receptor α1 (IL-13Rα1) and IL-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα). Recent studies show that a decoy receptor for IL-13, namely IL-13Rα2, mitigates IL-13 signaling and function. This study provides evidence for regulation of IL-13Rα2 production and release and IL-13-dependent signaling by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs). LPA treatment of HBEpCs in at imedependent fashion increased IL-13Rα2 gene expression without altering the mRNA levels of IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml, 4 h) or transfection of c-Jun small interference RNA or an inhibitor of JNK attenuated LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 gene expression and secretion of soluble IL-13Rα2. Overexpression of catalytically inactive mutants of phospholipase D (PLD) 1 or 2 attenuated LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 gene expression and protein secretion as well as phosphorylation of JNK. Pretreatment of HBEpCs with 1 μm LPA for 6 h attenuated IL-13-but not IL-4-induced phosphorylation of STAT6. Transfection of HBEpCs with IL-13Rα2 small interference RNA blocked the effect of LPA on IL-13-induced phosphorylation of STAT6. Furthermore, pretreatment with LPA (1 μm, 6 h) attenuated IL-13-induced eotaxin-1 and SOCS-1 gene expression. These results demonstrate that LPA induces IL-13Rα2 expression and release via PLD and JNK/AP-1 signal transduction and that pretreatment with LPA down-regulates IL-13 signaling in HBEpCs. Our data suggest a novel mechanism of regulation of IL-13Rα2 and IL-13 signaling that may be of physiological relevance to airway inflammation and remodeling. Interleukin-13 (IL-13), a Th2 cytokine, plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis of bronchial asthma via IL-13 receptor α1 (IL-13Rα1) and IL-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα). Recent studies show that a decoy receptor for IL-13, namely IL-13Rα2, mitigates IL-13 signaling and function. This study provides evidence for regulation of IL-13Rα2 production and release and IL-13-dependent signaling by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs). LPA treatment of HBEpCs in at imedependent fashion increased IL-13Rα2 gene expression without altering the mRNA levels of IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml, 4 h) or transfection of c-Jun small interference RNA or an inhibitor of JNK attenuated LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 gene expression and secretion of soluble IL-13Rα2. Overexpression of catalytically inactive mutants of phospholipase D (PLD) 1 or 2 attenuated LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 gene expression and protein secretion as well as phosphorylation of JNK. Pretreatment of HBEpCs with 1 μm LPA for 6 h attenuated IL-13-but not IL-4-induced phosphorylation of STAT6. Transfection of HBEpCs with IL-13Rα2 small interference RNA blocked the effect of LPA on IL-13-induced phosphorylation of STAT6. Furthermore, pretreatment with LPA (1 μm, 6 h) attenuated IL-13-induced eotaxin-1 and SOCS-1 gene expression. These results demonstrate that LPA induces IL-13Rα2 expression and release via PLD and JNK/AP-1 signal transduction and that pretreatment with LPA down-regulates IL-13 signaling in HBEpCs. Our data suggest a novel mechanism of regulation of IL-13Rα2 and IL-13 signaling that may be of physiological relevance to airway inflammation and remodeling.

Taken together, these studies suggest that LPA plays a critical role in airway inflammation by regulating immunomodulation of bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells However, mechanisms of LPA-dependent modulation of Th2 type cytokine-induced signaling are unclear. To further determine the role of LPA in airway inflammation, we report here that LPA induces IL-13Rα2 mRNA expression through phospholipase D (PLD)-dependent JNK/AP-1 signaling in HBEpCs. This is the first report on LPA induced IL-13Rα2 gene expression and production in HBEpCs. Further, we found that elevated IL-13Rα2 expression attenuated IL-13-mediated phosphorylation of STAT6 and eotaxin and SOCS-1 gene expression in HBEpCs.

The transfection complex was diluted into 900 μl of bronchial epithelial cell basal medium and added directly to the cells. The medium was replaced with bronchial epithelial cell basal medium after 3 h, and cells were used for experiments at 72 h after transfection. Statistical Analyses—All results were subjected to statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance and, whenever appropriate, were analyzed using the Student-Newman-Keuls test. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. of triplicate samples from at least three independent experiments, and the level of significance was taken to p < 0.05. LPA Induces IL-13Rα2 Gene Expression and Secretion through Gαi in HBEpCs—Using a DNA microarray, we found that LPA treatment of HBEpCs induced IL-13Rα2 gene expression after 24 h. 3L. Wang and V. Natarajan, unpublished data. To confirm this result, we examined the changes in IL-13Rα1, IL-13Rα2, and IL-4Rα gene levels with or without LPA treatment by RT-PCR and related real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, compared with IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα gene levels, the IL-13Rα2 mRNA level is very low in HBEpCs. The increase of IL-13Rα2 gene expression was detected at 6 h (∼3-fold) after LPA (1 μm) treatment, reaching ∼7-fold after 24 h (Fig. 1B), whereas LPA (1 μm) treatment had no effect on IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα gene expression (Fig. 1A). These results show that only IL-13Rα2, not IL-13Rα1 or IL-4Rα, is inducible by LPA treatment in HBEpCs. Similar to LPA treatment, IL-13 (10 ng/ml, 6 h) and IL-4 (10 ng/ml, 6 h) also increased IL-13Rα2 gene expression (Fig. 1B). To further confirm up-regulation of IL-13Rα2 by LPA, we next investigated IL-13Rα2 secretion after LPA treatment in HBEpCs. Using an anti-IL-13Rα2 extracellular domain antibody, we monitored soluble IL-13Rα2 protein levels in media after LPA (1 μm) treatment and observed a peak at 6 h (Fig. 1C). A 6-h incubation with LPA induced IL-13Rα2 secretion in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1D). Pretreatment of HBEpCs with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 4 h attenuated LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 gene expression and soluble IL-13Rα2 secretion (Fig. 1, E and F). These results suggest that LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 gene expression and secretion is through Gi-coupled LPA receptors on the cell surface in HBEpCs. Role of JNK/AP-1 Signaling in LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 Gene Expression and Secretion—Our previous studies (41Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K.

Spannhake E.W. Brindley D.N. Natarajan V. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have shown that NF-κB and AP-1 transcriptional factors were involved in LPA-induced IL-8 secretion in HBEpCs. To determine the mechanisms of regulation of IL-13Rα2 gene expression and secretion by LPA, we inhibited NF-κB and AP-1 activities by transfection of siRNA or pharmacological inhibitors prior to LPA challenge. Transfection of NF-κB subunit RelA siRNA or pretreatment with the I-κB kinase inhibitor Bay11-7082 (5 and 10 μm) did not affect LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 gene expression and protein release (Fig. 2, A and C). In contrast, down-regulation of c-Jun protein expression (Fig. 2B) by transfection of c-Jun siRNA attenuated LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 secretion in HBEpCs (Fig. 2A). Further, pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor JNKiII for 1 h significantly attenuated LPA-mediated IL-13Rα2 mRNA expression (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2B shows that the transfection of RelA siRNA or c-Jun siRNA down-regulated expression of the respective transcription factors in HBEpCs as determined by Western blotting with specific antibodies to RelA or c-Jun. These results suggest that regulation of IL-13Rα2 gene expression and secretion by LPA is at least partly dependent on JNK/AP-1 signal transduction. Role of PLD in LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 Gene Expression and Secretion—Our previous studies have shown that LPA stimulates PLD1 and -2 in HBEpCs (50Bernacki S.H. Nelson A.L. Abdullah L. Sheehan J.K. Harris A. Davis C.W. Randell S.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LPA-induced PLD activation could be blocked by overexpression of hPLD1 or mPLD2 catalytically inactive mutants, or by pretreatment with 1-butanol but not 3-butanol (50Bernacki S.H. Nelson A.L. Abdullah L. Sheehan J.K. Harris A. Davis C.W. Randell S.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated the role of PLD activation in LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 release. LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 release was attenuated by pretreatment with 1-butanol (0.5%, 15 min) not 3-butanol (0.5%, 15 min; Fig. 3A), suggesting the involvement of PLD. To confirm these data, inhibition of PLD activity by overexpression of hPLD1 or mPLD2 mutants was performed by transfection of adenoviral vectors encoding hPLD1 or mPLD2 mutants (50Bernacki S.H. Nelson A.L. Abdullah L. Sheehan J.K. Harris A. Davis C.W. Randell S.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Consistent with the data using 1-butanol, both hPLD1 and mPLD2 mutants attenuated LPA-induced IL-13Rα2 gene expression and secretion (Fig. 3, B and D). Fig. 3C confirms overexpression of hPLD1 and mPLD2 mutants by Western blotting with specific antibodies to PLD1 or PLD2. As JNK/AP-1 regulated LPA-mediated I"
https://openalex.org/W2065590853,"The representation of navigational optic flow across the inferior parietal lobule was assessed using optical imaging of intrinsic signals in behaving monkeys. The exposed cortex, corresponding to the dorsal-most portion of areas 7a and dorsal prelunate (DP), was imaged in two hemispheres of two rhesus monkeys. The monkeys actively attended to changes in motion stimuli while fixating. Radial expansion and contraction, and rotation clockwise and counter-clockwise optic flow stimuli were presented concentric to the fixation point at two angles of gaze to assess the interrelationship between the eye position and optic flow signal. The cortical response depended upon the type of flow and was modulated by eye position. The optic flow selectivity was embedded in a patchy architecture within the gain field architecture. All four optic flow stimuli tested were represented in areas 7a and DP. The location of the patches varied across days. However the spatial periodicity of the patches remained constant across days at ∼950 and 1100 µm for the two animals examined. These optical recordings agree with previous electrophysiological studies of area 7a, and provide new evidence for flow selectivity in DP and a fine scale description of its cortical topography. That the functional architectures for optic flow can change over time was unexpected. These and earlier results also from inferior parietal lobule support the inclusion of both static and dynamic functional architectures that define association cortical areas and ultimately support complex cognitive function."

However, the underlying mechanism by which they cause these responses remains unclear. We show here that salicylates induce phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), resulting in the inhibition of mRNA translation in cells. Exposure of cells to acetyl salicylic acid resulted in strong activation of eIF2α stress-activated protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). Analysis of fibroblasts with a targeted deletion of the perk gene revealed that PERK is indispensable for triggering the phosphorylation of eIF2α as well as the inhibition of protein synthesis induced by salicylates. Although salicylate treatment did not trigger activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1, there was an increased expression of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP-(gadd153), a downstream event to eIF2α phosphorylation known to mediate endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated responses. Thus, salicylates selectively trigger an endoplasmic reticulum stress-responsive signaling pathway initiated through activation of PERK to induce their cellular effects.

The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs sodium salicylate and aspirin have been widely used to prevent and treat a number of diseases including inflammation and cancer (1Levy G.N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 2Amann R. Peskar B.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 447: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Modulation of inflammation by salicylates is, at least in part, due to their ability to inhibit prostaglandin H synthase (cyclooxygenase (COX) 3The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase; ASA, aspirin; NaSal, sodium salicylate; eIF2α, α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2; PKR, protein kinase R; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PERK, PKR-like ER kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; XBP-1, X-box-binding protein 1; IRE1, inositol-requiring enzyme 1; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.) activity (3Vane J.R. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7344) Google Scholar). Aspirin (ASA) efficiently and irreversibly blocks the activity of cyclooxygenases by acetylating specific residues in the COX protein. Salicylic acid (sodium salicylate (NaSal)), the aspirin metabolite, is a very poor COX inhibitor, but it is nevertheless able to suppress inflammation at doses comparable with those of ASA (4Mitchell J.A. Akarasereenont P. Thiemermann C. Flower R.J. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11693-11697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). The cellular pathways involved in the COX-independent activities of NaSal and other salicylic acid-derived compounds (salicylates) have been at least partially identified (5Tegeder I. Pfeilschifter J. Geisslinger G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2057-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). For example, it is known that salicylates can both trigger activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and also inhibit the activation of NF-κB, thus inducing apoptosis via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and preventing NF-κB-regulated inflammatory gene expression (6Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar, 7Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F.W. Collins T. J.

It has also been reported that ASA and NaSal act as potent inhibitors of protein synthesis in guinea pig gastric mucosal tissue and rat islets (9Spohn M. McColl I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 608: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 10Kwon G. Hill J.R. Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism responsible for this effect remains unclear. The α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) is a component of the stable ternary complex formed by Met-tRNAMeti, GTP, and eIF2. Formation of this complex is an essential step in the assembly of the 40 S ribosomal subunit and subsequent protein synthesis (11Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Under a variety of stress conditions, eIF2α is phosphorylated on serine 51 by specific stress-activated kinases. This modification leads to a reduction in the rate of mRNA translation (12Hinnebusch, A. G. (2000) (Sonenberg, N., Hershey, J. W. B., and Mathews, M. B., eds) pp. 185–243, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Four mammalian eIF2α kinases have been identified so far. The general control of amino acid biosynthesis kinase (GCN2) is specifically activated in response to amino acid deprivation (13Hinnebusch A.G. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol.

The hemin-regulated inhibitor kinase was identified in reticulocytes and found to inhibit protein synthesis in heme-deprived lysates and stressed cells (17Chefalo P.J. Oh J. Rafie-Kolpin M. Kan B.

Biol. 2001; 21: 7971-7980Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A third eIF2α kinase, protein kinase R (PKR), is activated by double-stranded RNA of viral or synthetic origin, thereby shutting down cellular mRNA translation and inhibiting virus replication (20Williams B.R. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: RE2Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Finally, a PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) has been identified as pancreatic eIF2α kinase (21Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. An J. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7499-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and as ER resident kinase (22Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar). PERK is activated in response to accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, reducing the rate of protein synthesis through eIF2α phosphorylation to assure proper protein folding (23Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). Cellular responses to severe ER perturbations, such as the unfolded protein response, may also include increased expression of ER-localized proteins containing KDEL motifs (24Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 25Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.

In mammalian cells, transcriptional activation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP(gadd153) (27Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar) is observed following ER stress caused by agents such as thapsigargin, tunicamycin, dithiothreitol (DTT), or amino acid starvation. This may occur in a PERK-dependent manner as a consequence of a selective increase in translation of the transcription factor ATF4 or in an ATF3-dependent manner (14Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar, 26Kaufman R.J.

In addition to PERK, another mammalian ER transmembrane protein, mIRE1β, has been shown to regulate CHOP(gadd153) expression (30Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). This redundancy suggests that cellular responses initiated by ER stress may utilize multiple pathways to regulate translation and subsequent events. Additionally, although the mechanism linking ER stress to caspase activation remains unclear (23Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar), it is possible that ER-mediated stress signals induce programmed cell death via CHOP(gadd153) (27Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Given that exposure of cells to NaSal or ASA results in inhibition of protein synthesis, we looked at the ability of these drugs to elicit phosphorylation of eIF2α and at the activation of its upstream regulators and downstream effectors. Here we show that salicylates inhibit cellular protein synthesis by inducing phosphorylation of eIF2α in a PERK-dependent manner. As a reflection of ER stress-mediated responses, salicylates induced expression of the transcription factor CHOP(gadd153) and caused degradation of caspase-12. These findings characterize a specific signaling pathway, initiated in the ER, that is triggered by salicylates to mediate their anti-proliferative actions. Pharmacological and suprapharmacological concentrations of salicylates were used in this study. The high concentrations were used as a more effective response was observed. We have shown that salicylate concentrations in the range used therapeutically had the ability to cause a specific cellular response. A large number of studies have reported the use of high concentrations of salicylates, so that the potential effects observed in in vitro studies can be translated to clinical applications. It should be considered that after ingestion of therapeutic doses of salicylates, such as aspirin, some organs (e.g. stomach, kidney) or inflamed areas are exposed to particularly high concentrations of these drugs. The results from our in vitro studies obtained with high concentrations suggest that locally high salicylate concentrations may contribute to trigger a specific ER stress response that could be beneficial in clinical settings such as cancer treatment. Cell Culture and Reagents—The human promonocytic cell line THP-1 was grown in 10% fetal bovine serum RPMI medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin, in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. SV40-immortalized PERK+/+ and PERK–/– fibroblasts (a kind gift from Heather Harding and David Ron, New York University School of Medicine, New York) were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin and streptomycin. NaSal and ASA were purchased from Sigma. DTT was purchased from Invitrogen. NaSal was prepared at 1 m concentration in deionized water and then passed through a 0.2-μm filter. ASA was dissolved at 1 m final concentration into Me2SO prior to treatments. Immunoblotting Analysis—Following treatments, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Cell extracts were obtained with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 μg/ml of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Following incubation on ice for 10 min, cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. Proteins were assayed for Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad protein assay). Cell extracts were fractionated onto SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Anti-caspase-12 and phospho-site-specific antibodies against eIF2α (Ser-51) and PERK (Thr-980) were from Cell Signaling. CHOP(gadd153) antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Edward Maytin (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cleveland Clinic Foundation). Metabolic Cell Labeling and Trichloroacetic Acid Precipitation—One day before the experiment, THP-1 cells were washed twice with PBS and plated at a density of 106 cells/ml in 60-mm dishes. Following treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in PBS. Cell labeling in methionine-free medium was followed by addition of [35S]methionine Redivue (50 μCi/ml; 1,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and incubation for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and protein extracts obtained in lysis buffer (the same as used for immunoblotting analyses). Thirty micrograms of cell extract were fractionated onto 12% SDS-PAGE, stained by Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed for autoradiogram analysis. To monitor the incorporation of [35S]methionine into total cellular proteins, cellular extracts were assayed for trichloroacetic acid precipitation and analyzed by scintillation counting. Briefly, 30 μg of cell extract was added to 500 μl of 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin containing 0.01% NaN3. Following incubation on ice for 5 min, 500 μl of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid solution was added and incubated for an additional 30 min on ice. The suspension was filtered through glass microfiber disks (Whatman GF/C) and washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and twice with ethanol. Dried air disks were transferred to scintillation vials, and 5 ml of scintillation liquid was added and radioactivity measured by scintillation counting. Results were normalized as the percent increase or decrease of [35S]methionine incorporation compared with that of control untreated cells. Mammalian Cell Lysate Preparation and Polyribosome Analysis—THP-1 cells (grown in suspension at 2 × 106 cells/ml) were treated (prior to collection) for 10 min with cyclohexemide (100 μg/ml final concentration), then washed twice with PBS buffer (containing 100 μg/ml cyclohexemide) and collected by centrifugation (10 min at 3,500 rpm). Cell pellets were further resuspended in ice-cold cell lysis buffer, containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100 units/ml RNase inhibitor and 100 μg/ml cyclohexemide. Cells were homogenized by passing through a 25-gauge syringe, and the suspension was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 15 min to remove mitochondria and cellular debris. Cell extracts (2–5 A260 units) were loaded on top of linear 7–50% sucrose gradients in 10 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.9 buffer, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT. Centrifugation was done for 18 h at 17,000 rpm using a Beckman SW32.1 rotor. Gradients were unloaded by upward displacement using a programmable density gradient system with a UV (UA-6) detector (Teledyne Isco, Inc.). Cell extracts prepared from the control cells (not treated with ASA or NaSal) or treated with ASA and NaSal were used. Reverse Transcription-PCR and Restriction Endonuclease Digestion Analysis of X-box-binding Protein 1 (XBP-1) mRNA Processing—One microgram of total RNA derived from untreated or treated SV40-immortalized PERK wild-type and knock-out mouse fibroblasts was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)12–18 in the presence of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase SuperScript II (Invitrogen). One-tenth of the cDNA first-strand reaction was used as template in PCR to amplify a 600-bp cDNA segment of XBP-1 mRNA encompassing the cleavage sites of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) (a small 26-bp intron that contains a PstI restriction site within). Primers sequences used in the PCR assay are the same as described by Calfon et al. (31Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). One-third of the PCR volume was then digested with PstI restriction endonuclease at 37 °C for 150 min to reveal the restriction site, which is lost following XBP-1 mRNA cleavage by IRE1. PCR and digestion reactions were fractionated onto 1.2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Inhibition of Protein Synthesis by Salicylates in Human Promonocytic Cells—To determine whether NaSal and ASA affect the rate of protein synthesis in cultured cells, we performed a metabolic cell labeling experiment by measuring [35S]methionine incorporation into nascent proteins. The human promonocytic cell line THP-1 was treated with NaSal (20 mm) or ASA (10 mm) for 1, 3, 6, or 9 h. By comparing total nascent cellular protein labeled with 35S (Fig. 1A, upper panels) to total cellular protein as visualized by Coomassie Blue stain (Fig. 1A, lower panels), the relative amount of protein synthesis occurring in each sample was determined. Treatment of cells with DTT was used as a positive control and resulted in a dramatic inhibition of protein synthesis. At 1 and 3 h after treatment of the cells with NaSal, there was significant inhibition of protein synthesis followed by a partial recovery at 6 and 9 h. Inhibition of protein synthesis by ASA was also observed, although it was delayed and less pronounced, and appeared at 6–9 h. The extent of protein synthesis inhibition was quantitated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the extracts, counting the incorporated 35S and compared with the untreated control (Fig. 1C). These results show that there was at least a 40% reduction in 35S incorporation into nascent proteins when cells were exposed to NaSal for 1 or 3 h or to ASA for 6 or 9 h. The transient nature of the observed inhibitory effect suggests that inhibition of protein synthesis by salicylates at these concentrations is reversible. Having determined the optimal time for salicylate treatment that led to the inhibition of protein synthesis, we next investigated the dose response for these compounds. Inhibition of protein synthesis clearly increased with increasing doses of either NaSal or ASA, with a maximal effect of 98% reduction in 35S incorporation into nascent proteins following exposure of the cells to 20 mm ASA for 6 h (Fig. 1, B and D). Treatment of cells with an equivalent volume of the ASA solvent, Me2SO (lane D), did not significantly attenuate protein synthesis, confirming the specificity of the effect seen with 20 mm ASA. Although NaSal and ASA affect protein synthesis with distinct kinetics and dose-response curves, there are times and doses at which similar inhibition is noticed with the two drugs (Fig. 1, C and D). At higher concentrations, ASA is a much more potent inhibitor of protein synthesis than NaSal. Exposure of Cells to Salicylates Results in Phosphorylation of eIF2α—Given that phosphorylation of the α-subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2 is known to inhibit mRNA translation, we investigated whether the inhibitory effects of salicylates on protein synthesis were due to salicylate-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α. Protein extracts from THP-1 cells that were treated with increasing concentrations of salicylates were analyzed by Western blot with phospho-specific anti-eIF2α (Ser-51) antibody (Fig. 2A). The results show that phosphorylation of eIF2α is induced by treatment of cells with as little as 5 mm NaSal or ASA. At 10 mm, NaSal and ASA induced phosphorylation of eIF2α to a similar extent. A higher dose (20 mm) of NaSal led to more robust eIF2α phosphorylation, but a similar dose of ASA was even more effective at inducing this phosphorylation event. Treatment of cells with an equivalent volume of the ASA solvent Me2SO (lane DMSO) as the 20 mm ASA treatment did not result in phosphorylation of eIF2α, confirming the specificity of the ASA effect. As we observed that inhibition of protein synthesis caused by NaSal occurred earlier (at 60 min) and was stronger (38% decrease), we also determined that this effect is directly correlated with eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Exposure of Cells to Salicylates Results in Inhibition of mRNA Translation—As a result of eIF2α phosphorylation, a dissociation of polyribosomes and accumulation of ribosomal subunits occurs in stressed cells, thus resulting in dramatic inhibition of mRNA translation initiation (32Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar). To provide further direct evidence that ASA and NaSal cause inhibition of translation initiation in vivo, we compared the polysome profiles obtained after fractionation of cell extracts (prepared from untreated and treated cells) through 7–50% sucrose gradients. As shown in Fig. 3 (A, B), both ASA and NaSal led to a substantial decrease in the heavier polysome content and a commensurate increase in 80 S monosomes in cells. The reduction in polysome: 80 monosome ratios for these experiments is characteristic of a reduced rate of translation initiation. We thus further concluded that both compounds impair translation initiation. These results indicate that the inhibition of protein synthesis observed in THP-1 cells (Fig. 1) relies on a mechanism involving components of the translation initiation machinery. PERK Is Activated by Aspirin Treatment and Is Required for Salicylate-induced Phosphorylation of eIF2α and Inhibition of Protein Synthesis—Two stress-activated protein kinases, PKR and PERK, are known to mediate stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation (23Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar, 33Patel C.V. Handy I. Goldsmith T. Patel R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37993-37998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, PKR-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation is largely restricted to virus-infected cells, whereas a number of stress stimuli trigger the PERK-eIF2α module. Therefore, we first tested whether PERK was responsible for salicylate-induced eIF2α phosphorylation. To address this question, the phosphorylation of eIF2α was determined in salicylate-treated PERK-null and wild-type immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The expected phenotype of these cells was confirmed by noticing induction of eIF2α phosphorylation induced by DTT in wild-type and not in PERK-null cells (Fig. 4A). While eIF2α phosphorylation increased in the wild-type cells following 5 min of exposure to NaSal, there was no induction of eIF2α phosphorylation in PERK-null cells. However, at 20 min following NaSal treatment, the phosphorylation of eIF2α remains similar in both wild-type and PERK-null cells, decreasing in the latter at 60 min. This transient nature suggests that PERK is the protein kinase required to trigger the initial eIF2α phosphorylation induced by NaSal. We have shown here that high concentrations of ASA induce robust phosphorylation of eIF2α and dramatically inhibit protein synthesis. To demonstrate that PERK is required for the onset of ASA-induced eIF2α phosphorylation, wild-type and PERK-null fibroblasts were exposed to ASA for 5, 20, or 60 min. The result (Fig. 4B) shows that following 5 and 20 min of treatment, eIF2α phosphorylation is robustly induced in PERK wild-type and not in PERK-null cells, suggesting that PERK plays a key role in the phosphorylation of eIF2α induced by ASA. Albeit to a lesser extent than in wild-type cells, following 60 min of ASA treatment, eIF2α phosphorylation could be observed in PERK-null cells. Having demonstrated that the onset of ASA-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α requires PERK, we next tested whether ASA induces activation of PERK. To this end, we used a phospho-specific anti-PERK antibody that recognizes the activated form of PERK. The result (Fig. 4C) shows that PERK undergoes autophosphorylation at Thr-980 following exposure of cells to ASA as with DTT, a known PERK activator (34Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). Comparison of PERK activation in PERK-null and wild-type cells confirmed both the antibody specificity and the genotype of the cells used in this experiment. To determine whether there was a PERK-dependent effect on protein synthesis in ASA-treated cells, [35S]methionine incorporation into cellular proteins was determined and analyzed. When wild-type cells were treated with either ASA or DTT (Fig. 5), a dramatic reduction in protein synthesis occurred. In PERK-null cells, however, protein synthesis was not significantly affected by either DTT or ASA. This suggests that, as with DTT, inhibition of protein synthesis triggered by ASA is mediated through activation of PERK. Nevertheless, a residual inhibitory effect of ASA on protein synthesis in PERK-null cells is observed, suggesting a distinct mechanism independent of PERK. Salicylates Induce the Expression of ER Stress-regulated Transcription Factor CHOP(gadd153) and Cleavage of ER Resident Caspase-12 but Do Not Trigger the Activation of IRE1—Phosphorylation of eIF2α and the subsequent inhibition of mRNA translation initiation have been shown to be followed by up-regulation of ER stress-responsive transcripts, including that encoding the transcription factor CHOP(gadd153) (14Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar, 35Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 36Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We then determined whether the latter downstream event occurred following salicylate treatment. The results (Fig. 6A, B) show that CHOP-(gadd153) has its expression strongly induced in cells following salicylate treatment in cells. Up-regulation of the proapoptotic transcription factor CHOP(gadd153) in response to ER stress has been shown to be PERK dependent (14Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Our results show that the expression of CHOP(gadd153) induced by salicylates is partially dependent on PERK. In contrast, expression of CHOP(gadd153) induced by DTT was significantly reduced in PERK-null cells. In addition, we found that while the SV40-immortalized fibroblasts used in these experiments express high levels of the eIF2α kinase PKR, this kinase is dispensable for the up-regulation of CHOP-(gadd153) induced by NaSal (data not shown). It has been shown that activation of IRE1 is necessary to drive the expression of CHOP(gadd153) in response to stress stimuli (30Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). To determine whether salicylates induce IRE1 activation in cells, we carried out reverse transcription-PCR analysis to detect IRE1-mediated splicing of XBP-1 transcription factor (31Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, 37Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Our results depicted in Fig. 6C indicate that ASA or NaSal (top panel), but not DTT or tunicamycin, failed to activate IRE1 as detected by the XBP-1 mRNA processing. This suggests that CHOP(gadd153) expression induced by salicylates most likely is independent of IRE1. Another hallmark event of ER stress-mediated responses is the proteolytic activation of caspase-12 (38Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). Caspase-12 degradation occurs only after prolonged ER stress. To provide further evidence that salicylates affect ER homeostasis, we analyzed caspase-12 expression by Western blot in wild-type and PERK-null cells following treatment with DTT or two distinct concentrations of salicylates. We observed that untreated PERK-null cells had higher levels of caspase-12 protein than untreated wild-type cells (Fig. 7), corroborating the findings of Harding and colleagues (26Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). However, in both cell types, caspase-12 was degraded following exposure to either DTT or salicylates. Degradation in response to salicylates occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of cellular protein synthesis by salicylates has been reported elsewhere (9Spohn M. McColl I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 608: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 10Kwon G. Hill J.R. Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism responsible for this effect remained unclear. Our findings provide evidence for a mechanism, initiated in the lumen of the ER, by which salicylates trigger inhibition of protein synthesis. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of protein synthesis by salicylates correlates with phosphorylation of eIF2α (Figs. 1 and 2A). PKR-like kinase PERK was required to initiate phosphorylation of eIF2α and mediate inhibition of protein synthesis in response to salicylates (Figs. 4, A and B, and 5). We also found that PERK was activated by salicylates (Fig. 4C) and was required to promote the inhibition of global protein synthesis (Fig. 5). Treatment of cells with salicylates led to up-regulation of CHOP(gadd153) and cleavage of caspase-12 (Figs. 6, A and B, and 7), hallmark events of ER stress (14Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar, 27Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H.

Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). These results indicate that a specific signaling pathway involving the ER mediates the effects of ASA and NaSal on cells. However, salicylate-induced expression of CHOP(gadd153) was only partially dependent on PERK and did not require PKR either (Fig. 6, A and B, and data not shown). Its expression is probably not mediated through IRE1 (Fig. 6C), since salicylates did not induce IRE1-mediated processing of XBP-1 transcription factor mRNA. These observations suggest that an additional eIF2α kinase (14Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar) or parallel ER stress players might contribute to salicylate-induced CHOP(gadd153) activation (40Wang X.Z.

IRE1 acts as activator of gene expression in the ER cellular responses (43Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), whereas PERK is responsible for translational regulation, even though ER stress compounds induce CHOP(gadd153) expression in a PERK-dependent manner (23Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that salicylates will affect both the activity of components related to the ER stress pathway and the activation of additional eIF2α kinase. The observations above have led us to propose that salicylates may bind to a cellular component localized in the ER. A member of a family of glucose-regulated stress chaperones, Bip/GRP78, is responsible for maintaining proteins in a folding-competent state in the ER (26Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). Bertolotti et al. (34Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar) showed that PERK is found in a complex with Bip/GRP78 in cells without ER stress conditions. Notably, these authors demonstrated a time-dependent dissociation of the complex following ER stress induced by DTT or thapsigargin. Interestingly, a report published a few years ago demonstrated that NaSal and ASA can bind in vitro to Bip/GRP78 (44Deng W.G. Ruan K.H. Du M. Saunders M.A. Wu K.K. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2463-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although these authors did not observe induction of ER stress markers following NaSal stimulation of human foreskin fibroblasts. Given these findings, it is tempting to speculate that the early events in salicylate-induced mRNA translation inhibition may involve binding of the drug to the Bip/GRP78-PERK complex in the ER, followed by PERK dissociation, dimerization, auto-activation, and substrate (eIF2α) phosphorylation. The data presented here do not exclude the possibility that additional components activated from ER stress might be involved. Indeed, there are other ways in which salicylates might impinge on ER physiology. For example, salicylates can uncouple oxidative phosphorylation and thus affect ATP production (45Cronstein B.N. Van de Stouwe M. Druska L. Levin R.I. Weissmann G. Inflammation. 1994; 18: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and at high doses they may also affect glucose transport into cells (46Williamson R.T. Lond M.D. Brit. Med. J. 1901; 1: 760-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Both stresses activate the unfolded protein response, which takes place in the ER. Nonetheless, further experiments will need to be carried out to better clarify this issue. Pharmacological and suprapharmacological doses of salicylates have been used in this study so that we could elucidate the mechanism by which these pharmacological compounds affect protein synthesis and the activity of components in the ER. It must be mentioned that the phosphorylation of eIF2α and the inhibition of protein synthesis are noticed at concentrations that approach those used in specific therapeutic settings, i.e. in the range of 1–5 mm (47Insel P.A. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Goodman Gilman A. Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 9th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 617-657Google Scholar). In addition to these observations, it must also be considered that high concentrations of ASA and NaSal are found in inflamed tissues and some organs, which may account for some of their clinical and side effects (48Brune K. Agents Actions Suppl. 1977; 2: 163-177PubMed Google Scholar). Our results justify further investigation into the effects of salicylates on translational machinery and ER homeostasis in cancer cells (49Meric F. Hunt K.K. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 971-979PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, our identification of eIF2α phosphorylation and CHOP(gadd153) gene activation as targets of salicylate action may provide insights into the design of aspirin-like drugs with more effective anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative properties. We thank Drs. David Ron and Patricia Stanhope-Baker for valuable comments and suggestions on the manuscript."

The serine proteases (SPs) 2The abbreviations used are: SP, serine protease; PPAF, prophenoloxidase activating factor. in extracellular signaling cascades activate each other in a highly ordered manner with some restricted specificity for substrates. The blood coagulation cascade in mammals employs SPs such as coagulation factor Xa and thrombin to amplify the signal from tissue damage (1O'Brien D. McVey J. Sim E. The Natural Immune Systems, Humoral Factors. IRL Press, New York1993: 257-280Google Scholar). This cascade is tightly regulated both to prevent any loss of blood and to avoid inappropriate clots. In invertebrates, diverse biological processes including embryonic development and immune responses are also driven by SP cascades, many of which are accomplished by clip domain SPs containing one or two clip domains at the N terminus of the SP domain (2Krem M.M. Cera E.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To date, 37 clip domain SPs have been identified in the Drosophila genome data base, many of whose physiological functions have been genetically and biochemically studied (3Ligoxygakis P. Pelte N.

The three SPs, called prophenoloxidase (pro-PO) activating factor (PPAF)-I, -II, and -III, are involved in the prophenoloxidase activating cascade, a major defense system of the insect, where activated phenoloxidase produces melanin around injury sites or invading microorganisms in the hemolymph (insect blood) (9Cerenius L. Soderhall K. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 10Gillespie J.P. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Whereas PPAF-I and -III belong to the catalytic group of clip domain SPs, PPAF-II belongs to the non-catalytic group of clip domain SP because of replacement of the active site serine residue by glycine (7Kwon T.H. Kim M.S. Choi H.W. Joo C.H. Cho M.Y. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6188-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recognition of aberrant surface and microbial cell wall components leads to activation of PPAF-I and -III by a SP cascade in insect hemolymph. The activated PPAF-I cleaves pro-PO into a smaller but inactive PO, and PPAF-III cleaves catalytically defective PPAF-II. We previously demonstrated that the cleaved PPAF-II molecules by PPAF-III form a dodecameric oligomer and is able to recruit PO molecules forming a PO·PPAF-II complex that can exhibit a strong PO activity (11Piao S. Song Y.L. Kim J.H. Park S.Y. Park J.W. Lee B.L. Oh B.H. Ha N.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4404-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We also determined the crystal structure of PPAF-II (11Piao S. Song Y.L. Kim J.H. Park S.Y. Park J.W. Lee B.L. Oh B.H. Ha N.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4404-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), revealing that the clip domain plays a role by interacting with a protein through its central cleft and is tethered to the SP domain of the protein. Many members of catalytic group of the clip domain SP are called easter-type proteases, because they are structurally related to the well characterized Drosophila easter that cleaves the growth factor-like Spatzle in the Toll signaling pathway (12Morisato D. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 371-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The clip domain of easter-type proteases was reported to play an essential role in rapid activation of the protease, although the clip domain is not tethered to the SP domain, which is unlike the non-catalytic group of the clip domain SPs (11Piao S. Song Y.L. Kim J.H. Park S.Y. Park J.W. Lee B.L. Oh B.H. Ha N.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4404-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The SP domain of easter-type proteases is believed to share its general architecture and catalytic mechanism with those of trypsin, and participates in signal amplification by cleaving and activating downstream easter-type SPs or effector proteins. The SP domains of easter-type SPs are distinguished from other SPs including non-catalytic clip domain SPs by comparison of amino acid sequences. For instance, a short insertion loop containing two cysteine residues is present only in easter-type proteases (Fig. 1). However, the structure of an easter-type protease has not been determined. To understand the relationship between structure and function of easter-type SPs, we determined the crystal structure of the SP domain of PPAF-I from the large beetle H. diomphalia. Structure-based biochemical analyses provided insights into the roles of the structural features of easter-type proteases in zymogen activation. Overexpression and Purification of Proteins—Overexpression and purification of recombinant full-length PPAF-I and PPAF-I SP domain (88-365) in the baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) were previously reported (11Piao S.

Mutant PPAF-I protein was constructed using the QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and purified according to the same protocol used for wild-type PPAF-I (13Piao S. Kim D. Park J.W. Lee B.L.

In brief, the crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 14 °C in a precipitation solution containing 0.15 m lithium sulfate, 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). An x-ray diffraction data set was collected using the synchrotron radiation from beamline 4A at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (Korea), and processed using the HKL2000 program (15Otwinosky Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Activation of PPAF-I by Lysyl Endopeptidase—To activate full-length PPAF-I or the SP domain of PPAF-I, 5 μg of each protein was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.2 μg of lysyl endopeptidase. PPAF-I and -III Activity Assay Using a Peptide Substrate—The reaction mixture containing activated PPAF-I or PPAF-III was added to the final 100 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) buffer containing 2 mm peptide substrate, t-butoxycarbonyl-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA, and either 1 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EDTA. After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 800 μl of 17% acetic acid followed by incubation for 10 min. The proteolytic activity of each sample was measured as fluorescence intensity with excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. Heparin Effect on the Activity of PPAF-III—To examine the effect of heparin on the activity of PPAF-III, heparin (up to 7.7 mg/ml) was added in the reaction mixture. To measure the proteolytic activity of activated PPAF-III on PPAF-II, 0.5 μg/ml PPAF-II was used instead of the peptide substrate in the presence (7.7 mg/ml) or absence of heparin. An aliquot of 20 μl of the reaction mixture was taken at given times (0, 30, and 60 min) and immediately boiled for denaturing gel electrophoretic analysis. Structure Determination and Overall Structure of the SP Domain of PPAF-I—Based on a boundary between the clip and SP domains determined by a limited proteolysis experiment, the SP domain of PPAF-I-(88-365) was produced in the baculovirus/insect cell system and purified to homogeneity in a zymogen form (11Piao S. Song Y.L. Kim J.H. Park S.Y. Park J.W. Lee B.L. Oh B.H. Ha N.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4404-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The purified zymogen protein was confirmed not to exhibit catalytic activity. The zymogen protein was crystallized, and a high-quality diffraction data set was collected from a single flash-cooled crystal (14Piao S. Jung J.Y. Park J.W. Lee J. Lee B.L. Ha N.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The crystal structure was determined by the molecular replacement method, and the final 1.7-Å resolution model contains residues 90-365 with an N-glycosylated residue, 1 calcium ion, and 128 water molecules (Fig. 2A). The SP domain of PPAF-I has the conserved core structure of the chymotrypsin fold with catalytic residues Ser-315 (c195; “c” for the chymotrypsinogen numbering), His-155 (c57), and Asp-220 (c102) (Fig. 2A). The catalytic triad, including its hydrogen bonding network, is already prearranged in the structure, in agreement with similar observations with prethrombin 2 (a zymogen form of thrombin) (22Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and chymotrypsinogen (23Wang D. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 595-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the active serine proteases, three highly conserved residues (c193-c195) of the oxyanion hole show an unusual backbone conformation of a “C”-shaped sharp turn, in which all the back-bone amine groups point toward the position where the negative charge developed during the transition state. However, this zymogen structure of PPAF-I shows that corresponding residues 313-315 (c193-c195) are in a stretched backbone conformation, in which each backbone amine group points dispersly, similar to that of prethrombin 2 (22Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Asp-309 (c189), the primary determinant of the S1 substrate specificity, is flipped out toward the solvent in the crystal structure, which suggests inactive conformation (Fig. 2A). The crystal structure reveals several distinctive features compared with the structures of chymotrypsin(ogen)-like SPs. The activation loop and the unique additional loop (75-loop) protrude from the globular core structure of the SP domain, and are located close to each other (Fig. 2B). In addition, the loops around the active-site cleft displays a large deviation from those of any other proteases and their zymogen forms whose structures are available (Fig. 2B). Calcium-binding Loop (70-Loop)—A three-dimensional modeling study on Drosophila easter predicted that a calcium ion was anchored by Glu-193 (c70) and Glu-203 (c80) in the 70-loop of easter (24Rose T. LeMosy E.K. Cantwell A.M. Banerjee-Roy D. Skeath J.B. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11320-11330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the PPAF-I SP domain showed a complete feature of the calcium ion bound in 70-loop, which is remote from the active-site cleft. In terms of calcium coordination, PPAF-I is different from other calcium-containing SPs including trypsin and PPAF-II (Figs. 1 and 3A). The calcium ion of PPAF-I is hepta-coordinated with pseudo-octahedral geometry involving the carboxylates of Glu-175 (c70) and Asp-183 (c78), the carbonyl oxygens of Asn-177 (c72) and Thr-180 (c75), plus two water molecules (Fig. 3A). In particular, Glu-175 (c70) and Asp-183 (c78) are strictly conserved among easter-type proteases, suggesting the presence of a calcium cage in this family of proteases. The bound calcium ion in easter has been suggested to play a critical in role in its biological function (24Rose T. LeMosy E.K. Cantwell A.M. Banerjee-Roy D. Skeath J.B. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11320-11330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mutation of Glu-183 (c70) in easter that abrogates the calcium binding resulted in complete loss of easter activity in Drosophila development when the mRNAs were injected into embryos (24Rose T. LeMosy E.K. Cantwell A.M. Banerjee-Roy D. Skeath J.B. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11320-11330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the calcium ion is necessary for the enzymatic activity of PPAF-I using a highly purified protein and a calcium-chelating agent. The activated PPAF-I exhibited a significantly decreased enzymatic activity on the chromogenic peptide substrates following addition of EDTA to the reaction buffer (Fig. 3B). Subsequently, we observed that proteolytic susceptibility of PPAF-I substantially increased when the bound calcium ion was removed from the protein by EDTA (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the calcium ion stabilizes the overall structure of the SP domain leading to enhanced activity, although the calcium ion is not directly involved in the active site, as is the case with trypsin (25Sipos T. Merkel J.R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 2766-2775Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and coagulation factor Xa (26Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21495-21499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Highly Protruding Activation Loop—The activation loop of PPAF-I is highly extended out from the body of the SP domain in the crystal structure, although this region does not show distinct insertion in its primary structure, compared with chymotrypsinogen (Figs. 1 and 2, A and B). Interestingly, the corresponding loop of PPAF-II extends out from the core structure as observed in PPAF-I (Fig. 2B), but this results from interaction with the clip domain (11Piao S. Song Y.L. Kim J.H. Park S.Y. Park J.W. Lee B.L. Oh B.H. Ha N.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4404-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cleavage sequence that is in neighboring residues in the scissile bond of Lys-109 (c15)-Ile-110 (c16) is unusually far from the body of the SP domain. This unusual activation loop conformation is not a crystallographic artifact induced by crystal packing interactions because this region is exposed to the solvent channel in the crystal. The activation loop of PPAF-I is estimated to be very flexible considering the poorly defined electron density map (Fig. 4A) and high temperature factors in this region. Consistent with this, the activation loop of PPAF-I was preferentially cleaved by a protease lysyl endopeptidase that cleaves at lysine residues (Fig. 4B). Previously, we presented evidence that the clip domain of PPAF-I is separable from the SP domain by a single proteolytic cleavage between the inter-domain linker (11Piao S. Song Y.L. Kim J.H. Park S.Y. Park J.W. Lee B.L. Oh B.H. Ha N.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4404-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, we could not exclude a possibility that the clip domain regulates activation of the SP domain through a weak interaction between the clip domain and activation loop. In the present work, we confirmed that the clip domain does not affect cleavage of the SP domain activation loop by a limited proteolysis experiment using lysyl endopeptidase. The proteolytic susceptibility of the full-length PPAF-I activation loop was comparable with that of the PPAF-I SP domain lacking the clip domain (Fig. 4, B and C). The Unique Additional Loop (75-Loop)—The characteristic additional loop (75-loop) of easter-type SPs, which extends from the calcium-binding loop, consists of residues 184-196 including two unique cysteine residues (Fig. 5A). The crystal structure reveals that 75-loop includes a short hairpin structure (Fig. 5A) and is placed close to the activation loop at a distance of 4.6 Å (Fig. 5B). The short hairpin structure is stabilized by an inter-connection of the disulfide bond formed with the invariant cysteine residues (Cys-184, Cys-191) among the easter-type proteases. Because of this inter-connection, this hairpin structure is anticipated to be present in all members of the eastertype protease family despite the poor conservation of flanking amino acids between cysteine residues (Fig. 1). As noted above, 75-loop is located near the cleavage sequence for zymogen activation (Fig. 5B). This structural feature suggests that cleavage of the activation loop is resistant to proteases with deep active-site clefts, although it might be sensitive to proteases with shallow active-site clefts. A mutant PPAF-I, whose cleavage sequence was changed to a canonical sequence (Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) for enteropeptidase substrates, was totally resistant to proteolysis by enteropeptidase (data not shown). Enteropeptidase, which is known to activate trypsinogen, has a deep active-site cleft (27Lu D. Futterer K. Korolev S. Zheng X. Tan K. Waksman G. Sadler J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This led us to speculate that 75-loop might prevent access of the active-site cleft of enteropeptidase to the activation loop of PPAF-I, for 75-loop is the nearest structural element to the activation loop (Fig. 5B). The Canyon-like Deep Active-site Cleft—The structure of the PPAF-I SP domain defines a highly ordered and deep canyonlike active-site cleft. This canyon-like deep active site has been observed in thrombin, which is responsible for high substrate specificity. The active-site cleft is lined with surface loops composed of 30-loop (130-139), 60-loop (158-168), and 140-loop (263-269). Compared with amino acid sequences of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, 30- and 60-loops of PPAF-I have insertions, which form longer β-strands and a short α-helix in the structure, respectively (Figs. 2A and 6A). The structure of 140-loop is well defined in the PPAF-I structure, whereas the corresponding loop is highly disordered in the most zymogen form of SP structures. Remarkably, 60- and 140-loops are located over the catalytic triad, forming a narrow passage to the catalytic serine residue in the Cα trace of PPAF-I (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the side chains of Arg-160 (c62) in 60-loop and Glu-263 (c148) in 140-loop, which are also found in Drosophila easter and Spatzle processing enzyme (5Jang I.H. Chosa N. Kim S.H. Nam H.J. Lemaitre B. Ochiai M. Kambris Z. Brun S. Hashimoto C. Ashida M. Brey P.T. Lee W.J. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), may act as a latch blocking the passage to the cleft, as shown in Fig. 6. A similar observation was reported in the zymogen structure of complement factor D (28Jing H. Macon K.J. Moore D. DeLucas L.J. Volanakis J.E. Narayana S.V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 804-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and this interaction might be involved with preventing accidental activity of the zymogen form. Surface Patches Enhancing the Activity on a Natural Substrate—Thrombin contains two exosites that are involved in recognizing and interacting with macromolecular substrates and inhibitors. Structural comparison of PPAF-I and thrombin reveals that PPAF-I contains a basic surface area between the active-site cleft and the calcium binding loop, which is near the first exosite (exosite I) of thrombin (Fig. 7A). This region is composed of several basic residues, among which Arg-172, Arg-228, and Arg-261 are exclusively conserved in easter-type SPs (Fig. 1). Given the availability of PPAF-III, showing 45% sequence identity to PPAF-I in the SP domains (Fig. 1), and its protein substrate PPAF-II, we checked whether the SP domain of PPAF-III contains such surface patches using heparin, an anionic glycosaminoglycan. We observed that the proteolytic activity of PPAF-III was severely impaired on its protein substrate PPAF-II, but not on the peptide substrate, in the presence of heparin (Fig. 7, B and C). This result suggests that heparin may bind to a surface patch of PPAF-III, inhibiting interaction with the protein substrate. We determined the crystal structure of the SP domain of PPAF-I, revealing several structural features of easter-type proteases, such as the calcium coordination, the unique additional loop containing a disulfide bond, the deep active-site cleft, and the highly exposed activation loop. Subsequent biochemical studies demonstrated that the bound calcium ion provides structural integrity to the SP domain, leading to enhancement of the enzymatic activity. The exposed activation loop was preferentially cleaved by a nonspecific protease in a clip domain independent manner, indicating that the clip domain is not involved with zymogen activation of its SP domain. Comparison of the structure of the PPAF-I SP domain with thrombin identified basic surface elements in the PPAF-I SP domain, prompting us to carry out a biochemical study with PPAF-III in the presence of heparin, an anticoagulant against thrombin. Surprisingly, heparin inhibited the PPAF-III activity on the protein substrate, not on the peptide substrate, strongly suggesting that heparin interacts with the protein substrate competitively on a surface patch of PPAF-III that is not a part of active-site cleft. This result offers further structural insight into the strategy of easter-type proteases to select their downstream protein substrate. We speculate that this surface patch of PPAF-III plays a similar role as the fibrinogen-recognition exosite (exosite I) of thrombin, providing high substrate specificity. The interaction of exosite I of thrombin with the central E region of fibrinogen is well established, providing proper orientation of the catalytic triad for cleavage of fibrinogen fibrinopeptides (29Pechik I. Madrazo J. Mosesson M.W. Hernandez I. Gilliland G.L. Medved L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2718-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30Pechik I. Yakovlev S. Mosesson M.W. Gilliland G.L. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3588-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This nonsubstrate interaction of thrombin with fibrinogen promotes cleavage of fibrinopeptides, resulting in their conversion into fibrin. Analogous to thrombin, easter-type SPs might achieve their high specificity for recognition of their downstream proteins through their surface patches, together with their deep active-site clefts. In conclusion, we presented the first three-dimensional structure of the SP domain of an easter-type protease with biochemical analyses on the bound calcium and the exposed activation loop. In addition, we presented evidence that an eastertype SP has a surface patch that plays a similar role as the fibrinogen recognition exosite of thrombin. These results provide insights into an activation mechanism of easter-type proteases in proteolytic cascades, in comparison with the well studied blood coagulation pathway in mammals. The detailed structure of easter-type proteases will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of substrate recognition and the specific zymogen activation in various biological processes.

However, only in rhodopsin the retinylidene Schiff base bond to the apoprotein is eventually hydrolyzed, making a complex regeneration pathway necessary. Metabolic regeneration cannot be short-cut, and light absorption in the active metarhodopsin (Meta) II intermediate causes anti/syn isomerization around the retinylidene linkage rather than reversed trans/cis isomerization. A new deactivating pathway is thereby triggered, which ends in the Meta III “retinal storage” product. Using time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, we show that the identified steps of receptor activation, including Schiff base deprotonation, protein structural changes, and proton uptake by the apoprotein, are all reversed. However, Schiff base reprotonation is much faster than the activating deprotonation, whereas the protein structural changes are slower. The final proton release occurs with pK ≈ 4.5, similar to the pK of a free Glu residue and to the pK at which the isolated opsin apoprotein becomes active. A forced deprotonation, equivalent to the forced protonation in the activating pathway, which occurs against the unfavorable pH of the medium, is not observed. This explains properties of the final Meta III product, which displays much higher residual activity and is less stable than rhodopsin arising from regeneration with 11-cis-retinal. We propose that the anti/syn conversion can only induce a fast reorientation and distance change of the Schiff base but fails to build up the full set of dark ground state constraints, presumably involving the Glu134/Arg135 cluster.

The receptor subsequently proceeds through a number of intermediates each characterized by its specific absorption spectrum in the UV-visible and mid infrared range. Related conformational changes of the binding pocket and of other, more remote parts of the apoprotein eventually lead to the active G-protein binding state, metarhodopsin II (Meta II). 3The abbreviations used are: Meta, metarhodopsin; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; R-/RR-Meta, intermediates of Meta II photolysis; BTP, 1,3-bis-(tris(hydroxymethyl)-methyl-amino)propane; LED, light-emitting diode; Nd:YAG, neodymium yttrium aluminum garnet.

The formation of the active species through the photointermediates has been described as a stepwise lowering of the stabilizing effect of the Schiff base counterion, which is a complex structure that comprises highly conserved Glu181 and Glu113. In Meta I, the counterion appears to undergo a shift relative to the Schiff base, whereas the receptor is still inactive (16Ludeke S. Beck M. Yan E.C. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Vogel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The subsequent deprotonation of the Schiff base linkage between Lys296 and the aldehyde group of the retinal is reflected in the strong shift of the absorption maximum from 480 to 380 nm, which is the spectral signature of Meta II and results in a protonation of Glu113 (17Jäger F.

This “forced protonation” occurs as long as all-trans-retinal has all structural determinants, including the 9-methyl group and an intact β-ionone ring enabling it to act as a rigid scaffold (25Vogel R.

This can be interpreted in terms of an incomplete scaffold function of the retinal in these modified pigments. Active Meta II eventually decays in opsin and all-trans-retinal (29Wald G. Science. 1968; 162: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). For completion of the visual cycle, fresh 11-cis-retinal has to be supplied by a complex retinoid cycle to regenerate rhodopsin. This is remarkable because other retinal proteins such as archaeal or invertebrate rhodopsins can simply regenerate the ground state when a second photon in the active state is absorbed (for review, see Refs. 30Gärtner W. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N.J. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. Vol. 3. Elsevier, Amsterdam2000: 297-388Google Scholar and 31Lanyi J.K. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1992; 607: 245-248PubMed Google Scholar). Spectroscopic data show that blue light absorption of the active Meta II state does not lead back to the ground state (λmax = 500 nm) to a significant extent but to a product with an absorption maximum at 475 nm (32Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). By UV-visible and FTIR difference spectroscopy, this blue light-induced photoproduct of Meta II could be identified as Meta III (33Ritter E. Zimmermann K. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Bartl F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48102-48111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Zimmermann K. Ritter E. Bartl F.J. Hofmann K.P. Heck M. J. Biol.

Brown P.K. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that this thermal product contains the chromophore in the Schiff base all-trans-15-syn configuration (35Vogel R. Siebert F. Mathias G. Tavan P. Fan G. Sheves M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9863-9874Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and that the Meta III formed by light absorption is the same by all available criteria. Hence, Meta III is also triggered by light-induced anti/syn isomerization of the C=N double bond of the Schiff base (36Bartl F.J. Vogel R. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2007; 10 (1039/b616365c)Google Scholar). These findings substantiated the previous concept of the first and second switch (32Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which are now identified as the cis/trans isomerization of the polyene chain and the syn/anti isomerization of the Schiff base, respectively. The end product of the new light-induced pathway, Meta III, can form up to 80%, depending on the conditions, and has remarkable properties. Because of its long lifetime (up to hours (34Zimmermann K. Ritter E. Bartl F.J. Hofmann K.P. Heck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48112-48119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)), it excludes the chromophore very efficiently from the regeneration pathway, which has led to the concept of a retinal storage form (34Zimmermann K.

Remarkably, the lifetime of Meta III depends on the presence of G-protein (34Zimmermann K. Ritter E. Bartl F.J. Hofmann K.P. Heck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48112-48119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and arrestin (39Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9407-9417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which was interpreted as an “inverse catalysis” of receptor conversion by G-protein. Given the fact that these proteins undergo light-dependent transport, and that the rate of rhodopsin regeneration is affected by the decay of Meta II and Meta III in contrast to the phosphorylation rate (41Paulsen R. Miller J.A. Brodie A.E. Bownds M.D. Vision Res. 1975; 15: 1325-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), interesting possibilities of regulation are thereby opened. The putative physiological implications and mechanistic significance of the light-induced deactivation pathway, which might play a role under conditions of bright light illumination, have led us to investigate its kinetics and the intermediates involved. Time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopy and electrical measurements of the activating and the deactivating pathway have already given indications that the light-induced absorption change related to Schiff base reprotonation occurs at a surprisingly high rate, namely even faster than the deprotonation linked to Meta II formation (20Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Ritter E. Zimmermann K. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Bartl F.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16888-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have therefore attempted to obtain additional information on the kinetics of the conformational conversions by time-resolved infrared difference spectroscopy, which allows us to follow a variety of structural alterations of the protein connected to its activity occurring on a 10-ms time scale. It turns out that anti/syn isomerization causes proper reprotonation of the retinal Schiff base but fails to couple to structural changes that are mandatory to fully deactivate the protein. Rhodopsin Purification and Preparation—Rhodopsin in washed disk membranes was purified from fresh dark-adapted bovine retinae. In a first step, rod outer segments were prepared by a discontinuous sucrose gradient method (43Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Subsequently, washed disk membranes were obtained by repetitive washes with a low ionic strength buffer and fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (44Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 45Sachs K. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 238-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodopsin membrane suspension was stored at -80 °C until use. As buffer, we used 1,3-bis(tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino)propane (BTP), and pH values were adjusted with diluted (0.1 m) NaOH and HCl. During all preparation steps the sample was kept under dim red light (λ > 640 nm). FTIR Measurements—FTIR samples were prepared by a centrifugation procedure as described (32Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin membrane suspension was centrifuged (30 min, 100,000 × g, 4 °C) to obtain a 2-3 mm pellet, which was exposed to dry air for 60 s to further reduce water content. Subsequently the pellet was transferred into a temperature-controlled cuvette consisting of two BaF2 windows and a 3-μm polytetrafluoroethylene spacer. FTIR spectra were measured in a Bruker IFS66v/s spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector (J15D-series, EG&G Judson). Before measurement, each sample was equilibrated for at least 30 min in the spectrometer. FTIR spectra were recorded before and after illumination, and FTIR difference spectra were calculated by subtracting the spectra of the initial state (A) from the spectra of the final state (B) and termed as “B minus A difference spectra.” Illumination was performed with the following light sources: For non-time-resolved measurements, we used a ring of six green or blue LEDs placed directly at the cuvette (520 ± 10 nm or 400 ± 10 nm, respectively). With LEDs, the sample was illuminated for 4 s. For illumination during the time-resolved experiments, we used two different lasers: For activation of rhodopsin a Nd:YAG laser (Spectron Lasers SL 282G), tuned to 532 nm, was directly focused on the sample. For deactivation of Meta II, a second Nd:YAG laser (SL 456-10), emitting at 355 nm, was used to pump a customized dye-laser emitting at 389 nm (Dye: Exalite 389, Radiant Dyes, Germany). The pulse duration of the Nd:YAG was 6 ns. One flash activated or deactivated ∼40% of the rhodopsin on a sample spot of 5-mm diameter as estimated by bleaching the samples with LEDs of the appropriate wavelength. A complete conversion to Meta II or Meta III, respectively, could not be achieved by the flash illumination due to the absorption of a second photon by early intermediates of the reaction pathways. This induces back and/or side reactions to rhodopsin and isorhodopsin (activation) (9Matthews R.G. Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) or to so far unknown products (deactivation). To investigate whether a certain intermediate is active toward the G-protein, the “Extra-Meta II” assay was used (46Bartl F. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A rhodopsin pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of a solution of BTP and 10 mm G-protein-derived high affinity peptide (Gtα-(340-350) VLEDLKSCGLF) (46Bartl F. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g and 4 °C. By this procedure, a pellet containing the peptide in excess was obtained. Time-resolved FTIR difference spectra were recorded with the rapid scan technique. To enhance time resolution, double-sided forward-backward measured interferograms were split into four single-sided interferograms. Because one scan takes 100.0 ms at a spectral resolution of 4 cm-1 and 64.8 ms at a spectral resolution of 8 cm-1, respectively, we achieved a time resolution of 25 ms at 4 cm-1 and 16.2 ms at 8 cm-1. Due to the fast reaction, activation was measured with both resolutions, 4 and 8 cm-1. The slower kinetics of deactivation allowed us to measure this reaction with the slower time resolution of 25 ms but with high spectral resolution of 4 cm-1. Sample excitation by the laser flash was synchronized with the forward signal of the mirror movement to minimize the influence of the flash on the signal. Each experiment was reproduced at least six times. Non-time-resolved measurements were done by averaging 128 scans; for time-resolved spectroscopy four independent measurements were averaged. Time courses of single bands were smoothed by a digital band-block filter and fitted to first order exponentials to evaluate the half times t½. The three-dimensional plots were smoothed by using the Savatzky-Golay algorithm. UV-visible Measurements—For measurements in the UVvisible spectral range, the same centrifugation procedure as described for FTIR was applied. The rhodopsin pellets were transferred to a temperature-controlled transmission cuvette consisting of two BaF2 windows and a 50-μm spacer of polytetrafluoroethylene. Measurements were performed with an OLIS RSM-16 spectrometer equipped with a photomultiplier tube as detector. Time resolution was 1 ms, and the total data collection time was 3 s. Flash illumination of the sample was applied using a flash lamp (Rapp OptoElectronic GmbH) with 2-ms flash duration. For illumination of rhodopsin and Meta II, a 480 nm shortwave cut-off (Schott GG 475) and a 400-450 nm band pass filter were used, respectively. During the flash, the detector of the spectrometer was covered by a shutter to avoid any influence of the flash light on the detector signal. For the decay measurement in Fig. 4B we used a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer scanning every 12 s over 3.5 min. In Fig. 1, we show the UV-visible spectra of the light-induced deactivation of Meta II and of the light-induced activation of rhodopsin for comparison, initiated by a blue and a green flash, respectively. The black line in Fig. 1 with an absorption maximum of 498 nm represents the spectrum of the ground state. At pH 6.0 and 10 °C, rhodopsin was activated by a green flash (λ > 480 nm, 2 ms). Spectra were recorded on a millisecond time scale and plotted every 20 ms (thin green lines). The first spectrum measured immediately after the flash shows an absorption maximum of 480 nm, indicative for the Meta I intermediate. Subsequently, this band vanishes while a new band at 380 nm appears, which reflects the formation of Meta II. A single exponential fit to the time course (trace a in the inset of Fig. 1) yields t½ = 70 ms. We achieved a maximum bleaching of ∼40% of total rhodopsin by one flash as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Quantitative conversion to Meta II was subsequently performed by bleaching the sample with green light (λ > 500 nm) for 10 s (Fig. 1, thick green line). A blue flash (400-450 nm, 2 ms) was then applied to induce deactivation of Meta II. The blue lines in Fig. 1 show the respective UV-visible spectra recorded on a millisecond time scale. Traces were plotted every 20 ms. The blue flash induces an immediate reduction of the intensity of the 380 nm absorption (half time, t½ < 5 ms) and a corresponding rise at ∼475 nm. Neither any significant further reduction of the 380 nm band nor any other notable change of the absorption spectra could be detected within a time scale comparable to the activation process. ∼40% of total Meta II were converted by the flash and quantitative conversion to the 475 nm product (dashed blue line) was subsequently achieved by continuous (10 s) blue light illumination of the sample. The absorption change at 380 nm evoked by the blue light flash is shown in trace b in the inset of Fig. 1 (blue). The fast kinetics cannot be resolved with the rapid scanning UV-visible spectrometer; the same experiment performed with a flash photolysis setup with microsecond time resolution (32Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) yielded a half time of 4.5 ms at 10 °C for this process. These experiments indicate a fast, light-induced reprotonation of the Schiff base, which is faster than the deprotonation step in the activating pathway. Because the absorption maxima in the UV-visible spectra solely report on the protonation state of the chromophore, time-resolved FTIR difference spectroscopy was used to compare the kinetics of conformational changes of the apoprotein. Activation—Fig. 2A shows the FTIR difference spectra of rhodopsin illuminated by a 6 ns laser flash (532 nm, Nd:YAG) as a function of time in a three-dimensional plot. To demonstrate that the formation of both species, Meta I and Meta II, can be fully resolved with our experimental setup, the spectra were recorded at 0 °C and pH 6 every 25 ms. Under these conditions, the first spectrum after the flash is a Meta I minus rhodopsin difference spectrum, as indicated by the bands at 951/970 cm-1, the typical fingerprint approximately 1238/1205 cm-1, the doublet at 1536/1549 cm-1, and the characteristic band pattern approximately 1700 cm-1 (Fig. 2, A and B, red lines) (47Siebert F. Isr. J. Chem. 1995; 35: 309-323Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 48Siebert F. Mäntele W. Gerwert K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Subsequently, bands at 1748/68 cm-1, 1643 cm-1, and 1556 cm-1 reflect an increasing contribution of a Meta II minus rhodopsin difference spectrum. After a few seconds the final state is reached and the spectrum exhibits now the typical Meta II difference bands. The black line in Fig. 2B is the last spectrum recorded 8 s after the activating flash. The green lines in Fig. 3 show the kinetics of selected characteristic FTIR bands, representing the formation of active Meta II as extracted from a three-dimensional plot, recorded at 10 °C and pH 6 (spectral resolution 8 cm-1, time resolution 16.2 ms). Difference bands reflecting proton transfer processes, changes in hydrogen bonding, and the secondary structure occurring during the formation of Meta II show kinetics similar to those observed in the literature (49Parkes J.H. Gibson S.K. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6862-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and to our own time-resolved UV-visible spectra shown in Fig. 1. This applies to the band at 1748 cm-1 (A) indicating changes of the hydrogen bonding environment of Asp83 and of Glu122, to the bands at 1643 cm-1 (B; amide I-region) and at 1556 cm-1 (C; amide II-region and the C=C stretch of the chromophore) typical for changes in the secondary structure of the protein and to the band at 1713 cm-1 (D) characteristic for the protonation of the Schiff base counterion Glu113. These bands appear with comparable kinetics as observed for the 380 nm absorption shown in the inset of Fig. 1 reflecting Schiff base deprotonation in Meta II. The band at 1205 cm-1 (E), a marker band of both the protonated Schiff base in Meta I and of the 9-cis-retinal in the isorhodopsin ground state shows a biphasic behavior: a fast increase in absorption (t½ < 5 ms) due to the formation of isorhodopsin and Meta I, followed by a slower decrease (t½ ≈ 90 ms) representing formation of Meta II from Meta I. The negative band at 1238 cm-1 (F, green line) in the chromophore fingerprint region is typical for the light-induced 11-cis to all-trans isomerization, a process already completed in the early photointermediates. Therefore, this event is too fast to be resolved with the FTIR rapid-scan technique. Deactivation—We return to Fig. 2, to see FTIR difference spectra of light-induced deactivation. In Fig. 2C, at pH 6 and 10 °C, 25 ms after a blue flash, a difference spectrum is observed with a characteristic, intense difference band at 1556 cm-1 (red line in Fig. 2, C and D). However, most other spectral regions display only minor difference bands. Subsequently, difference bands typical for Meta III, including the Meta III marker band at 1348 cm-1, arise within 8 s (Fig. 2D, black line). The blue lines in Fig. 3 show the kinetics of selected difference bands characteristic for the light-induced deactivation. Interestingly, the kinetics is different from the activating pathway. Bands assigned to deactivating changes of hydrogen bonding or carboxylic acids or to changes of the secondary structure of the receptor occur on a much slower time scale than observed during the activation. Generally, most of the bands representing the deactivation process show a biphasic behavior with an additional fast component (t½ < 15 ms), which cannot be resolved with the available setup. For deactivation, the half time of the band at 1748 cm-1 (A), showing changes of the carboxylic acid residues Glu122 and Asp83 is t½ = 1700 ms and of the band at 1643 cm-1 (B), assigned to the amide I vibration and thus sensitive to changes of the secondary structure, is t½ = 1350 ms. These kinetics are not only significantly slower than the kinetics of the reprotonation process of the Schiff base during the deactivation (see blue line in the inset of Fig. 1B and Fig. 3, D and E) but are even slower than the kinetics of the same bands during the activation (green lines in Fig. 3, A and B). For comparison, the time constants for the 1748 cm-1 band during activation is 150 ms (1700-ms deactivation) and 80 ms (1350-ms deactivation) for the 1643 cm-1 band (secondary structure). The intense band at 1556 cm-1 (C), arising within a few milliseconds after the blue flash, indicates the formation of a species, which we term RR-Meta. The difference spectrum of this intermediate is ide"

Dendritic cells induce the activation of CD8 and CD4 T cells by presenting antigenic peptides on MHC class I and class II molecules, respectively. In a recent Science paper, Dudziak et al., 2007Dudziak D. Kamphorst A.O. Heidkamp G.F. Buchholz V.R. Trumpfheller C. Yamazaki S. Cheong C. Liu K. Lee H.W. Park C.G. et al.Science. 2007; 315: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar reveal that these tasks are handled by distinct populations of dendritic cells in vivo. Adaptive immune responses are initiated by the stimulation of naive T lymphocytes by dendritic cells in the secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and lymph nodes. Dendritic cells are distributed throughout the body, particularly at the skin and the mucosal surfaces where pathogens are most frequently encountered. Upon capturing antigens, the dendritic cells in peripheral tissue migrate into the local lymph node through the afferent lymphatic vessels and present antigens to naive lymphocytes. In addition to these migrating dendritic cells, certain subsets of dendritic cells reside strictly in the secondary lymphoid organs and are collectively known as blood-derived dendritic cells. These dendritic cells arrive as precursors from the blood and differentiate into various subsets in situ. The blood-derived dendritic cells consist of two major subsets, CD8αα+ DEC205+ CD11b− (CD8+) and CD8αα− DEC205− CD11b+ (CD8−) dendritic cells. Which of these dendritic cell populations are responsible for priming CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in vivo? Dudziak et al., 2007Dudziak D. Kamphorst A.O. Heidkamp G.F. Buchholz V.R. Trumpfheller C. Yamazaki S. Cheong C. Liu K. Lee H.W. Park C.G. et al.Science. 2007; 315: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar provide intriguing new evidence indicating that priming of these T cell subsets is preferentially handled by two types of blood-derived dendritic cells in the spleen. The authors reveal that the CD8+ and CD8− dendritic cells in the spleen can be distinguished by expression of lectins DEC205 on CD8+ dendritic cells and DCIR2 (dendritic cell inhibitory receptor-2)—recognized by antibody 33D1—on CD8− dendritic cells (Figure 1). By making chimeric molecules of anti-DEC205 antibody fused to a model antigen, the authors showed that antigen is taken up by the CD8+ dendritic cells in vivo, which subsequently resulted in preferential stimulation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells. In contrast, injection of 33D1 antibody-antigen chimeric protein resulted in targeting of antigen to the CD8− dendritic cells and subsequent stimulation of cognate CD4 T cells. Although both types of chimeric antibody-antigen proteins resulted in stimulation of both T cell subsets at high doses, a ten-fold difference in the efficiency of presentation was detected. Such preferential association of these dendritic cell subsets in priming of CD4 and CD8 T cells is consistent with previous studies that have examined the ability of ex vivo isolated dendritic cell subsets to stimulate T cell responses following in vivo injection of protein antigens (Itano et al., 2003Itano A.A.

Med. 2003; 197: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Specifically, CD8+ blood-derived dendritic cells are well known for their ability to present exogenous antigens on MHC class I molecules (Heath et al., 2004Heath W.R. Belz G.T. Behrens G.M. Smith C.M. Forehan S.P. Parish I.A. Davey G.M. Wilson N.S. Carbone F.R. Villadangos J.A. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 199: 9-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), in a process known as crosspriming. It was unclear whether the ability of CD8+ dendritic cells in crosspriming was due to their ability to capture the antigen or to process and present the antigen on MHC class I. By isolating splenic dendritic cells that have captured equal number of antigen-coated beads following systemic administration of labeled beads into mice, crosspresentation was shown to be much more efficient in CD8+ dendritic cells compared to CD8− dendritic cells (Schnorrer et al., 2006Schnorrer P. Behrens G.M. Wilson N.S. Pooley J.L. Smith C.M. El-Sukkari D. Davey G. Kupresanin F. Li M. Maraskovsky E. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These results suggested that crosspresentation requires specialized machinery that is expressed by CD8+ but largely absent from CD8− dendritic cells. This was precisely what Dudziak et al., 2007Dudziak D. Kamphorst A.O. Heidkamp G.F. Buchholz V.R. Trumpfheller C. Yamazaki S. Cheong C. Liu K. Lee H.W. Park C.G. et al.Science. 2007; 315: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar found: they demonstrated a striking divide between the CD8+ versus CD8− dendritic cells in their expression of genes important in class I versus class II MHC antigen-processing and presentation pathways (Figure 1). This differential expression pattern provided clear-cut evidence for the mechanism by which these dendritic cell subsets selectively present antigenic peptides to CD4 and CD8 T cells. As with all intriguing studies, several key questions arise. Given that the CD8+ subset presents peptides on MHC class I and to a much lesser extent on MHC class II, how do they receive signals from T helper cells that are essential for the ability of dendritic cells to induce primary and/or memory cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses? Perhaps the number of MHC class II+ peptide complexes that form on the surface of CD8+ dendritic cells, though inadequate for activating naive CD4 T cells, is sufficient to receive help from effector CD4 T cells, which would have been induced by the CD8− dendritic cells. Second, although their study revealed the division of labor by dendritic cell subsets to present soluble protein antigen injected systemically, do such rules apply also to infectious agents? Most infections begin at mucosal surfaces, and rapid and efficient induction of antimicrobial adaptive immunity is crucial for the survival of the host. Given that the dendritic cells in the lymph nodes have not been reported to express DCIR2 (Witmer and Steinman, 1984Witmer M.D. Steinman R.M. Am. J. Anat. 1984; 170: 465-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to test whether the DCIR2− CD8− dendritic cells in the lymph nodes possess similar affinity toward presentation of antigen on class II MHC. In a similar vein, CD8+ and CD8− dendritic cells express different subsets of Toll-like receptors and presumably other pattern recognition receptors. It would be important to investigate how this relates to their differential ability to activate CD4 and CD8 T cells, particularly in response to infection or vaccination. Finally, because dendritic cells that migrate from tissues transport peripheral antigen to the lymph nodes (Allan et al., 2006Allan R.S. Waithman J. Bedoui S. Jones C.M. Villadangos J.A. Zhan Y. Lew A.M. Shortman K. Heath W.R. Carbone F.R. Immunity. 2006; 25: 153-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), the relative contributions of these dendritic cells and the blood-derived ones (CD8+ and CD8− subsets) in priming CD4 T cells following local infection will need to be determined. Surely, the study by Dudziak and colleagues (2007) provides an important catalyst for future investigations to address these and other pertinent questions."

Unbridled by politics or bureaucracy, philanthropic organizations can fund the riskier projects that could yield the biggest payoffs. Philanthropists are exerting an unmistakable influence on the research agenda, drawing attention to long-ignored research areas, promoting collaborations, and giving scientists the freedom to explore serendipitous ideas. Unbridled by politics or bureaucracy, philanthropic organizations can fund the riskier projects that could yield the biggest payoffs. With RO1 individual investigator grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) becoming more difficult to obtain, researchers are seeking fresh sources of funding from philanthropic organizations. “We're starting to bleed here at the University of Washington. Postdocs and technicians are being laid off,” says George Martin, who studies aging. His institution is not alone. “It's happening all over the country. High-impact research institutes thrive on soft money and they're hit the hardest,” says Martin, who receives funding from the Alzheimer's Association and the M.J. Murdock Charitable Fund. “I don't see the possibility of any substantial increases in [NIH funding] so the money will have to come from private sources.”"
