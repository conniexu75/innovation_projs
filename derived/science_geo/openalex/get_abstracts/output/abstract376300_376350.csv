https://openalex.org/W2049599293,"Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and Tau is an invariant feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). The upstream role of Aβ accumulation in the disease pathogenesis is widely accepted, and there is strong evidence showing that Aβ accumulation causes cognitive impairments. However, the molecular mechanisms linking Aβ to cognitive decline remain to be elucidated. Here we show that the buildup of Aβ increases the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, whereas decreasing mTOR signaling reduces Aβ levels, thereby highlighting an interrelation between mTOR signaling and Aβ. The mTOR pathway plays a central role in controlling protein homeostasis and hence, neuronal functions; indeed mTOR signaling regulates different forms of learning and memory. Using an animal model of AD, we show that pharmacologically restoring mTOR signaling with rapamycin rescues cognitive deficits and ameliorates Aβ and Tau pathology by increasing autophagy. Indeed, we further show that autophagy induction is necessary for the rapamycin-mediated reduction in Aβ levels. The results presented here provide a molecular basis for the Aβ-induced cognitive deficits and, moreover, show that rapamycin, an FDA approved drug, improves learning and memory and reduces Aβ and Tau pathology.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a conserved Ser/Thr kinase that forms two multiprotein complexes known as mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and 2 (8Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N.

By regulating both protein synthesis and degradation, mTOR plays a key role in controlling protein homeostasis and hence brain function; indeed, mTOR activity has been directly linked to learning and memory (10Ehninger D.

Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 263: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 21Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar, 22Jung C.H.

Cumulative evidence suggests that an age-dependent decrease in the autophagy/lysosome system may account for the accumulation of abnormal proteins during aging (23Cuervo A.M. Bergamini E. Brunk U.T. Dröge W. Ffrench M. Terman A. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy) is induced when an isolation membrane is generated surrounding cytosolic components, forming an autophagic vacuole, which will eventually fuse with lysosomes for protein/organelle degradation. The induction of the isolation membrane is negatively regulated by mTOR (24Díaz-Troya S. Pérez-Pérez M.E. Florencio F.J. Crespo J.L. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Sixteen autophagy-related proteins (atg) are involved in the induction of autophagy in a series of ubiquitin-like reactions during different stages of the autophagosome formation (25Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 26Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y.

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). In the initial steps, Atg7 and Atg10 facilitate the binding of Atg12 to Atg5, which is necessary for autophagosome formation (25Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 26Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Another important step in the autophagosome formation is the activation of LC3-1 (the homologue of Atg8 in yeast). After its activation, LC3-1 is cleaved by Atg4 to form LC3-II, which is incorporated in the growing autophagosome membrane and is often used as a marker of autophagy induction (28Kabeya Y.

In this study we report the effects of reducing mTOR signaling on the neuropathological and behavioral phenotype of the 3xTg-AD mice. The derivation and characterization of 3xTg-AD mice has been described elsewhere (30Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Kayed R. Metherate R. Mattson M.P. Akbari Y. LaFerla F.M.

Briefly, two independent transgenes encoding human APPSwe and the human TauP301L (both under control of the mouse Thy1.2 regulatory element) were co-microinjected into single-cell embryos harvested from homozygous mutant PS1M146V knock-in (PS1-KI) mice. The 3xTg-AD and non-Tg mice used in these studies are on a mixed C57Bl6/129 background. To facilitate delivery, rapamycin was microencapsulated at a concentration of 2.24 mg/kg as described previously (14Harrison D.E. Strong R. Sharp Z.D. Nelson J.F. Astle C.M. Flurkey K. Nadon N.L. Wilkinson J.E. Frenkel K. Carter C.S. Pahor M. Javors M.A. Fernandez E. Miller R.A. Nature. 2009; 460: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar). Food containing empty microcapsules was used as the control diet. During the 10-week treatment, mice were given ad libitum access to water and the rapamycin or control diet. Morris water maze tests were conducted in a circular tank of 1.5 meters in diameter located in a room with extra maze cues. The platform (14 cm in diameter) location was kept constant for each mouse during training and was 1.5 cm beneath the surface of the water, which was maintained at 25 °C throughout the duration of the testing. During 5 days of training, the mice underwent 4 trials a day, alternating among 4 pseudorandom starting points. If a mouse failed to find the platform within 60 s, it was guided to the platform by the researcher and kept there for 20 s. The inter-trial interval was 25 s, during which time each mouse was returned to its home cage. Probe trials were conducted 24 h after the last training trial. During the probe trials, the platform was removed and mice were free to swim in the tank for 60 s. The training and probe trials were recorded by a video camera mounted on the ceiling, and data were analyzed using the EthoVisioXT tracking system. Mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and their brains extracted and cut in half sagitally. For immunohistochemical analysis, one-half was drop-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 48 h and then transferred in 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline until slicing. The other half was frozen in dry ice for biochemical analysis. Frozen brains were homogenized in a solution of tissue protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing 0.7 mg/ml of Pepstatin A supplemented with a complete Mini protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Invitrogen). The homogenized mixtures were briefly sonicated to sheer the DNA and centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was stored as the soluble fraction. The pellet was re-homogenized in 70% formic acid and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was stored as the insoluble fraction. For Western blot analyses, proteins from the soluble fraction were resolved by 10% BisTris SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated in a 5% solution of nonfat milk for 1 h at 20 °C. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibody, the blots were washed in Tween 20-TBS (T-TBS) (0.02% Tween 20, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 nm NaCl) for 20 min and incubated at 20 °C with the appropriate secondary antibody. The blots were washed in T-TBS for 20 min and incubated for 5 min with SuperSignal (Pierce) and exposed. Densitometric analysis was conducted using ImageJ software from the National Institutes of Health. The protein levels reported in the figures were obtained as a ratio between the band intensity for the protein of interest and the band intensity of β-actin, used as loading control. Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were measured from the soluble and insoluble fractions using a sandwich ELISA protocol as described in Ref. 31Oddo S. Caccamo A. Green K.N. Liang K. Tran L. Chen Y. Leslie F.M. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar. For immunohistochemical analysis, 50-μm thick sections were obtained using a Leica vibratome slicing system, and sections were stored at 4°C in 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline. To quench the endogenous peroxidase activity, free-floating sections were incubated for 30 min in H2O2. For the Aβ staining, sections were subsequently incubated in 90% formic acid for 7 min to expose the epitope. The appropriate primary antibody was applied, and sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After removing the primary antibody in excess, sections were incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at 20 °C. After a final wash of 20 min, sections were developed with diaminobenzidine substrate using the avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase system (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Images were obtained with a digital Zeiss camera and analyzed with ImageJ. 7PA2 cells were a generous gift from Dr. Edward Koo, University of California, San Diego.

Briefly, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C with a humidified environment (5% CO2 + 95% atmosphere). For Western blot analysis, cells were grown on 6-well plates to 75% confluence before transfection or drug administration. Compound E ((2S)-2-{[(3,5-difluorophenyl)acetyl]amino}-N-[(3S)-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,4-benxodiazepin-3-yl]propanamide) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Plymouth Meeting, PA). It is a potent, selective, non-transition state and non-competitive γ-secretase inhibitor. All the experiments were done at least in triplicate and independently replicated 3 times. The following antibodies were from the indicated sources: rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3 (Novus Biologicals, Littlelton, CO); anti-Actin (Sigma); anti-mTOR, phospho-mTOR, Phospho-p70S6K (Thr389), p70S6K, anti-ATG5, and anti-ATG7 (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA); anti-Tau HT7 and anti-AT270 (Pierce); anti-Aβ42 (Invitrogen); 6E10 (Signet, Dedham, MA); anti-Tau MC1 was a gift from Dr. Peter Davies; and anti-Lamp2A (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). mTOR activity was measured using the K-LISATM mTOR Activity Kit (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) following the manufacturer's protocol. Statistical analyses were conducted using multifactor analysis of variance including appropriate variables or t test when suitable. To determine the effects of Aβ on mTOR signaling we initially used Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with a cDNA encoding APP751 containing the Val717-Phe familial AD mutation known as 7PA2 (33Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells produce high levels of Aβ oligomers, which have been shown to impair several neuronal functions, including long-term potentiation and learning and memory (34Cleary J.P. Walsh D.M.

Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (3699) Google Scholar). Using Western blot analysis we found that the levels of total and phosphorylated mTOR at Ser2448 were not statistically significant between 7PA2 and control cells. In contrast, we found that the levels of p70S6K phosphorylated at Thr389 were significantly increased in 7PA2 cells compared with control Chinese hamster ovary cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Direct measurement of mTOR enzymatic activity showed a significant increase in the 7PA2 cells compared with control cells. mTOR function is routinely determined by measuring the steady-state levels of phosphorylated p70S6K at Thr389, which is an epitope directly phosphorylated by mTOR, because mTOR phosphorylation does not always correlate with its activity (37Das F.

Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 9-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2418) Google Scholar). Our data support this dissociation between mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448 and mTOR activity and clearly show that mTOR function is increased in 7PA2 cells. Consistent with the increase in mTOR activity, the phosphorylation levels of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, a downstream target of mTOR, were also increased in 7PA2 cells compared with control cells (supplemental Fig. S1). To determine whether the increase in mTOR signaling was mediated by Aβ or APP, we treated 7PA2 and control cells with the γ-secretase inhibitor compound E (200 nm) for 24 h. Although blocking Aβ production had no effect on total mTOR and p70S6K, it reduced the levels of phosphorylated mTOR and p70S6K (Fig. 1, C and D). Furthermore, we found that mTOR enzymatic activity was restored by blocking Aβ production (Fig. 1E). Notably, compound E had no effect on mTOR signaling in Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that the increase in mTOR signaling in 7PA2 cells is mediated by Aβ and not APP. These data are consistent with reports showing that Aβ increases the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway (41Bhaskar K. Miller M. Chludzinski A. Herrup K. Zagorski M. Lamb B.T. Mol. Neurodegen. 2009; 4: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 42Ito S. Kimura K. Haneda M. Ishida Y. Sawada M. Isobe K. Exp.

Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which is one of the signal transduction pathways known to increase mTOR activity (8Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4696) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that Aβ enhances mTOR signaling in 7PA2 cells as determined by the increase in mTOR enzymatic activity and the increase in the steady-state levels of phosphorylated p70S6K at Thr389, a site directly phosphorylated by mTOR (reviewed in Ref. 40Guertin D.A. Sabatini D.M. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 9-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2418) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine the effects of inhibiting mTOR function on Aβ levels. Toward this end, we treated 7PA2 cells with different concentrations of the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, all three concentrations of rapamycin used were sufficient to drastically reduce phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr389 and mTOR activity (Fig. 2, A–C), further confirming that the steady-state levels of phosphorylated p70S6K at this residue mirror mTOR activity. More importantly, we also found that rapamycin significantly reduced intracellular Aβ levels in 7PA2 cells as determined by ELISA measurements (Fig. 2D). Notably, whereas 0.5 μg/ml of rapamycin were sufficient to completely abolish p70S6K phosphorylation and significantly reduce mTOR activity (Fig. 2, A–C), the biggest decrease in Aβ levels was detected when rapamycin was used at a much higher concentration (50 μg/ml; Fig. 2D). Further studies are needed to determine whether this dissociation is due to different technique sensitivity (e.g. Western blots and Aβ ELISA), or whether high concentrations of rapamycin may also reduce Aβ levels by other mTOR-independent mechanisms. Overall, these data indicate that there is an interrelation between Aβ and mTOR signaling. To better understand the interrelation between mTOR and Aβ in vivo, we measured mTOR signaling in different brain regions of 6- and 12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. At 6 months of age, these mice show robust intraneuronal Aβ immunoreactivity, which is associated with the onset of cognitive decline (30Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E.

Although the levels of total and phospho-mTOR were similar between 3xTg-AD and non-Tg mice in all brain regions analyzed at both 6 and 12 months of age (Fig. 3, A–F), we found that the levels of phosphorylated p70S6K at Thr389 were significantly higher in the hippocampus and cortex of 6- and 12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice compared with age- and gender-matched non-Tg mice, whereas total levels of p70S6K were unchanged (Fig. 3, A–D). In contrast, the levels of phospho-p70S6K were unaltered in the cerebellum of the 3xTg-AD mice (Fig. 3E), a brain region with no Aβ pathology. Consistent with the levels of phospho-p70S6K, mTOR activity was also increased in the hippocampus and cortex of 3xTg-AD compared with non-Tg mice, although no changes were found in the cerebellum (Fig. 3, G–I). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the build-up of Aβ increases mTOR signaling and, more importantly, are consistent with reports showing an increase in mTOR signaling in human brains affected by AD (47Onuki R.

We next sought to determine whether the increase in mTOR signaling contributes to the neuropathological and cognitive phenotype of the 3xTg-AD mice. Toward this end, 6-month-old 3xTg-AD (n = 16) and age- and gender-matched non-Tg mice (n = 14) were fed rapamycin-containing food (2.24 mg/kg) for 10 weeks. As controls, 3xTg-AD (n = 14) and non-Tg mice (n = 13) were fed a control diet. At this age, the 3xTg-AD mice present early learning and memory deficits (45Oddo S. Caccamo A. Tseng B. Cheng D.

We carefully monitored the general health of mice throughout the course of treatment and did not observe any adverse effects or significant changes in their weight gain (Table 1). At the end of treatment, rapamycin levels in the blood were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography, and as expected, the levels of rapamycin in the blood of the mice on the control diet mice were below detection. In contrast, the levels of rapamycin in the 3xTg-AD and non-Tg mice fed rapamycin were 16.13 ± 2.57 and 14.23 ± 1.46 ng/ml, respectively, which was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).TABLE 1Percent of body weight change during rapamycin administrationMiceTreatment% Weight change during the 10 weeks of treatment123456789103xTg-AD (n = 16)Rapamycin0−2.52 ± 1.18%1.55 ± 1.28%0.92 ± 1.01%5.12 ± 1.47%3.54 ± 1.69%5.65 ± 2.51%7.97 ± 1.57%9.45 ± 2.68%10.69 ± 2.17%3xTg-AD (n = 14)Control0−1.41 ± 0.85%2.04 ± 1.36%2.36 ± 1.17%3.67 ± 1.06%2.80 ± 1.37%4.65 ± 1.22%7.20 ± 1.38%9.46 ± 1.05%9.24 ± 1.66%Non-Tg (n = 14)Rapamycin01.40 ± 0.74%5.88 ± 1.20%5.72 ± 0.93%7.78 ± 0.99%6.40 ± 1.05%7.68 ± 1.08%11.58 ± 1.31%13.53 ± 1.42%13.71 ± 1.71%Non-Tg (n = 13)Control0−0.87 ± 0.45%0.78 ± 0.83%0.87 ± 0.84%3.58 ± 0.96%4.51 ± 0.98%5.84 ± 1.07%8.56 ± 1.47%9.67 ± 1.43%13.72 ± 2.00% Open table in a new tab To determine the effect of chronic rapamycin administration on learning and memory, we used the spatial reference version of the Morris water maze, a task mainly dependent on the hippocampus. This task was selected because at this age the neuropathological phenotype in 3xTg-AD mice is most severe in the hippocampus (30Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Kayed R.

During the last week of treatment, mice received 4 training trials per day for 5 days to find the location of a hidden platform. Although the non-Tg mice treated with rapamycin performed similarly to non-Tg controls (escape latency at day 5 of 18.8 ± 6.5 and 20.7 ± 5.9 s, respectively; Fig. 4A), the 3xTg-AD treated with rapamycin performed significantly better than 3xTg-AD mice on the control diet after 5 days of training (escape latency at day 5 of 15.3 ± 4.3 and 29.7 ± 4.8 s, respectively; Fig. 4A). Notably, the 3xTg-AD mice on rapamycin performed as well as both non-Tg groups (Fig. 4A). To determine the effects of rapamycin on memory, the platform was removed from the maze and probe trials were conducted 24 h following the last training trial. We found that under"

It has remained unclear, however, how H2O2 concentrations above the threshold required to modify effectors are achieved in the presence of the abundant detoxification enzymes peroxiredoxin (Prx) I and II. We now show that PrxI associated with membranes is transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine-194 and thereby inactivated both in cells stimulated via growth factor or immune receptors in vitro and in those at the margin of healing cutaneous wounds in mice. The localized inactivation of PrxI allows for the transient accumulation of H2O2 around membranes, where signaling components are concentrated, while preventing the toxic accumulation of H2O2 elsewhere. In contrast, PrxII was inactivated not by phosphorylation but rather by hyperoxidation of its catalytic cysteine during sustained oxidative stress.

Phosphorylation inactivates peroxiredoxin I (PrxI), an enzyme that reduces H2O2 Ligation of growth factor or immune receptors induces PrxI tyrosine phosphorylation Phosphorylation occurs on membrane-associated but not cytosolic PrxI This localized inactivation of PrxI allows accumulation of H2O2 needed for signaling Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is generated in all aerobic organisms as a byproduct of normal cellular processes. Given that H2O2 is toxic to cells, however, such organisms are equipped with detoxifying enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidases (GPxs), and peroxiredoxins (Prxs). Many mammalian cell types also produce H2O2 in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, with the H2O2 so produced serving as a signaling molecule that regulates various biological processes. Stimulation of cells with various agonists thus induces H2O2 production, and blockage of H2O2 accumulation results in inhibition of signaling by such stimulants (D'Autréaux and Toledano, 2007D'Autréaux B.

For example, in cells stimulated with growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or epidermal growth factor (EGF), production of H2O2 is required for propagation of growth factor signaling (Bae et al., 1997Bae Y.S.

Among the best characterized H2O2 effectors are protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs): H2O2 specifically oxidizes the catalytic cysteine residue of these enzymes and thereby inhibits their activity (Chiarugi and Cirri, 2003Chiarugi P.

Indeed, the activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) is not sufficient to increase the steady-state level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in cells; the concurrent inhibition of PTPs by H2O2 is also required. Many other H2O2 effector molecules also contain an H2O2-sensitive cysteine residue. Evidence indicates that NADPH oxidase (Nox) is largely responsible for receptor-dependent H2O2 production (Clempus and Griendling, 2006Clempus R.E. Griendling K.K.

Signaling components of redox active endosomes: the redoxosomes.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1313-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Seven distinct catalytic subunits of Nox (Nox1 to Nox5, Duox1, and Duox2) have been identified (Lambeth, 2004Lambeth J.D. NOX enzymes and the biology of reactive oxygen.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). These catalytic subunits are transmembrane proteins and form multisubunit complexes with other membrane as well as cytosolic proteins. Nox generates superoxide by transferring one electron from NADPH to O2. Superoxide then undergoes dismutation to H2O2. Activated Nox complexes appear to assemble within discrete subcellular compartments, including lipid rafts and endosomes, thereby making it possible to produce toxic H2O2 molecules within a restricted region of the cell (Li et al., 2006Li Q. Harraz M.M. Zhou W. Zhang L.N. Ding W. Zhang Y. Eggleston T. Yeaman C. Banfi B. Engelhardt J.F.

Localizing NADPH Oxidase-derived ROS. Science's Stke, http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/2006/349/re8.Google Scholar). For H2O2 to serve as a signaling molecule, its concentration must increase rapidly above a certain threshold (10 to 100 μM) and remain elevated long enough for it to oxidize effector molecules (Stone and Yang, 2006Stone J.R. Yang S. Hydrogen peroxide: a signaling messenger.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 243-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). However, in most cells, H2O2-eliminating enzymes are present in large concentrations in the cytosol in order to ensure that the toxic molecule remains at low intracellular levels (<0.1 μM) (Stone and Yang, 2006Stone J.R. Yang S. Hydrogen peroxide: a signaling messenger.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 243-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). PrxI to PrxIV belong to the 2-Cys Prx subfamily of Prx enzymes, which exist as homodimers and reduce H2O2 with the use of reducing equivalents provided by thioredoxin (Trx) (Rhee et al., 2005Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Jeong W. Chang T.S. Yang K.S. Woo H.A. Intracellular messenger function of hydrogen peroxide and its regulation by peroxiredoxins.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). PrxI and PrxII are localized to the cytosol, whereas PrxIII and PrxIV are restricted to mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. PrxI and PrxII are also abundant, constituting a total of 0.2% to 1% of soluble protein in cultured mammalian cells (Chae et al., 1999Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Characterization of three isoforms of mammalian peroxiredoxin that reduce peroxides in the presence of thioredoxin.Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Catalase is exclusively localized in peroxisomes. GPx1 is present predominantly in the cytosol, but its concentration is smaller than that of PrxI or PrxII in most tissues. Prx enzymes are efficient in eliminating low concentrations of H2O2 because of their low Km values for this substrate (Chae et al., 1999Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Characterization of three isoforms of mammalian peroxiredoxin that reduce peroxides in the presence of thioredoxin.Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It has therefore remained unclear how, in the presence of PrxI and II, H2O2 can accumulate in the cytosol to a concentration sufficient for it to modify target proteins. The catalytic site of 2-Cys Prxs comprises the NH2-terminal region of one subunit and the COOH-terminal region of the other subunit in the homodimer (Rhee et al., 2005Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Jeong W. Chang T.S. Yang K.S. Woo H.A. Intracellular messenger function of hydrogen peroxide and its regulation by peroxiredoxins.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The peroxidatic Cys-SH (CP-SH) is located in the NH2-terminal region and is selectively oxidized by H2O2 to CP-SOH, which then reacts with the resolving Cys-SH (CR-SH) in the COOH-terminal region of the other subunit to form an intermolecular disulfide. The disulfide is reduced by Trx. During catalysis, the CP-SOH intermediate occasionally undergoes further oxidation by H2O2 to CP-SO2H before the relatively slow formation of a disulfide with CR-SH can occur. This hyperoxidation, which results in inactivation of peroxidase activity, is reversed by sulfiredoxin (Biteau et al., 2003Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. ATP-dependent reduction of cysteine-sulphinic acid by S. cerevisiae sulphiredoxin.Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, Woo et al., 2003aWoo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C.

Given that bacterial Prxs are resistant to hyperoxidation and that prokaryotes do not express sulfiredoxin, reversible inactivation through hyperoxidation has been proposed to be a eukaryotic adaptation that allows H2O2 to accumulate to substantial levels under certain circumstances, thereby facilitating H2O2-dependent signaling. This concept has been termed the “floodgate” hypothesis (Wood et al., 2003Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Peroxiredoxin evolution and the regulation of hydrogen peroxide signaling.Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). However, no hyperoxidized PrxI or II was observed in cells stimulated with PDGF (Choi et al., 2005Choi M.H. Lee I.K. Kim G.W. Kim B.U. Han Y.H. Yu D.Y. Park H.S. Kim K.Y. Lee J.S. Choi C. et al.Regulation of PDGF signalling and vascular remodelling by peroxiredoxin II.Nature. 2005; 435: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We have now found that PrxI is phosphorylated on Tyr194 and is thereby inactivated in cells stimulated via receptors for growth factors such as PDGF or EGF or via immune receptors such as T cell (TCR) and B cell (BCR) receptors. This phosphorylation is confined to PrxI molecules associated with cell membranes; it was not observed with PrxI present in the cytosol. The spatially confined inactivation of PrxI thus provides a means for generating favorable H2O2 gradients around a submembrane compartment, where signaling proteins are concentrated, while minimizing the general accumulation of H2O2 to toxic levels and disturbance of global redox potential. To determine whether Prxs are phosphorylated, we subjected recombinant human PrxI and II to an in vitro kinase assay with two nonreceptor PTKs, Lck and Abl, in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Both PTKs phosphorylated PrxI and PrxII, with the extent of phosphorylation for the former being markedly greater than that for the latter (Figure 1A , Figure S1A available online). Tyrosine-194 of PrxI was one of 600 phosphorylation sites revealed by a large-scale proteomic analysis in a cancer cell line treated with pervanadate (Rush et al., 2005Rush J. Moritz A. Lee K.A. Guo A. Goss V.L. Spek E.J. Zhang H. Zha X.M. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. Immunoaffinity profiling of tyrosine phosphorylation in cancer cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). We therefore generated antibodies to Tyr194-phosphorylated PrxI by injection with a phosphopeptide (KSKEpYFSKQK) corresponding to residues 190 to 199 of PrxI. The sequence SKEYFSK is conserved between PrxI and II. The extents of PrxI and PrxII phosphorylation detected by immunoblot analysis with the phospho-specific antibodies was similar to that revealed by measurement of 32P radioactivity, indicative of similar reactivities of the antibodies for the phosphorylated isozymes. To verify the phosphorylation site of PrxI, we expressed wild-type PrxI or a Tyr194 to Phe mutant (Y194F) in the PTK-expressing Escherichia coli strain TKB1. Phosphorylation of the wild-type protein was detected, whereas that of the Y194F mutant was not (Figure 1B), indicating that Tyr194 is the only site of tyrosine phosphorylation.Figure S1Phosphorylation of PrxI and PrxII In Vitro and Its Effect on the Catalytic Activity of PrxI, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Phosphorylation of PrxI and PrxII in vitro by Abl.

Primed residue numbers correspond to the subunit whose catalytic Cys is not shown. We next investigated the effect of phosphorylation of PrxI on its peroxidase activity by subjecting PrxI produced in TKB1 bacteria to affinity chromatography with an immobilized monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (4G10) in order to separate phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated proteins. The peroxidase activity of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of PrxI was then monitored in the presence of 50 μM H2O2 by coupling the peroxidase reaction to NADPH oxidation. After a lag time of ∼50 s, the reaction rate for phosphorylated PrxI achieved a steady state that was approximately one-seventh of that for nonphosphorylated PrxI (Figure 1C). No lag time was observed for nonphosphorylated PrxI. The reaction rate for nonphosphorylated PrxI decreased slightly with time because CP-SH becomes hyperoxidized during catalysis (see below), and the rate became zero when A340 reached 0.9 because of exhaustion of H2O2 (Figure 1C). A similar lag time (∼20 s) and reduced activity (approximately one-fourth of that for nonphosphorylated PrxI) were observed for phosphorylated PrxI when the H2O2 concentration was increased to 500 μM (Figure S1B). These results suggest that, at H2O2 concentrations in the low micromolar range, the lag time for phosphorylated PrxI would be substantially greater than 50 s and the steady-state reaction rate would be much less than one-seventh of that for the nonphosphorylated enzyme. The catalytic CP-SH of PrxI is highly reactive with H2O2, because it is surrounded by Arg128 and Arg151 that stabilize the thiolate anion (CP-S−), which is more readily oxidized by H2O2 than is its protonated thiol counterpart. Structural modeling predicted that the phosphate moiety of phospho-Tyr194 of one subunit of the PrxI homodimer is positioned within 9 Å of the sulfur atom of CP-SH (Cys52) of the other subunit (Figure 1D). The negatively charged phosphate group might thus be expected to impair the deprotonation of Cp-SH and thereby to decrease its reactivity with H2O2. However, after CP-SH has entered the catalytic cycle, reduction by Trx may return the CP residue to a state that is not affected to the same extent by the phosphate moiety and that is slightly more reactive with H2O2, resulting in a catalytic activity for the phosphorylated enzyme that is reduced but measurable. In support of this notion, a PrxI mutant in which Tyr194 is replaced by Asp (Y194D), which therefore contains a negatively charged carboxyl group at position 194, exhibited an activity time course similar to that for phosphorylated PrxI, whereas neutral replacement of the same residue by Phe did not substantially affect enzyme activity (Figure 1C). Comparison of the structures of PrxI and PrxII might also suggest an explanation for the observed slower phosphorylation of PrxII. His197 of PrxII appears to form a hydrogen bond with Asp181, with this interaction possibly hindering access of a PTK to Tyr193 (the residue corresponding to Tyr194 of PrxI) (Figure S1C). No analogous interaction is apparent in PrxI, in which Gln is present at the position corresponding to His197 of PrxII. With the antibodies specific for Tyr194-phosphorylated PrxI, we next examined whether PrxI or PrxII is phosphorylated in cells. PrxI and PrxII, which differ by one amino acid residue in size, cannot be separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis revealed that stimulation of rat smooth muscle cells with PDGF resulted in the transient phosphorylation of PrxI or II (Figure 2A ). Similar time-dependent phosphorylation of PrxI or II was observed in NIH 3T3 cells stimulated with PDGF (Figure S2A), HER (NIH 3T3 cells that stably express EGF receptor) stimulated with PDGF or EGF (Figure 3, Figure S2B), A431 cells stimulated with EGF (see Figure 4), Ramos B cells stimulated with antibodies to IgM (see Figure 4), and Jurkat T cells stimulated with antibodies to CD3 (see Figure 4). Stimulation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wild-type or PrxI knockout mice with PDGF yielded a phosphorylated Prx band with the former cells but not with the latter (Figure 2B), suggesting that PrxI is the primary target for growth factor-induced phosphorylation.Figure S2Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PrxI in Growth Factor-Stimulated Cells and Its Role in Receptor Signaling, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Serum-deprived NIH 3T3 cells were stimulated for the indicated times with PDGF (25 ng/ml).

This role for Lin28 has important implications for our mechanistic understanding of pluripotency, the timing of development, and oncogenesis. Lin28, a highly conserved RNA-binding protein, has emerged as a modulator of the processing of the let-7 microRNA. This role for Lin28 has important implications for our mechanistic understanding of pluripotency, the timing of development, and oncogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNAs with diverse regulatory roles. The discovery of miRNAs and closely related small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is a watershed moment in biology that has changed traditional views of genetic regulation and has placed small RNAs alongside transcription factors as critical regulators of gene expression. But what regulates these regulators? Recent studies indicate that miRNA biogenesis can be posttranscriptionally regulated by trans-acting factors. The Lin28/let-7 partnership is the best characterized example of the relationship between an miRNA and its posttranscriptional regulator and may shed light on the posttranscriptional regulation of other miRNAs. Here, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the posttranscriptional regulation of the let-7 miRNA by the conserved RNA-binding protein Lin28 and show how this impacts our understanding of pluripotency, development, and cancer. Lin28 was first characterized in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as an important regulator of developmental timing (Ambros and Horvitz, 1984Ambros V. Horvitz H.R. Science. 1984; 226: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, Moss et al., 1997Moss E.G. Lee R.C. Ambros V. Cell. 1997; 88: 637-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Mutations in the lin-28 gene and in other so-called “heterochronic genes” perturb developmental progression in the worm, such that characteristic events occur either earlier or later than normal. The mammalian homologs of lin-28, Lin28 and Lin28b, bind to the terminal loops of the precursors of let-7 family miRNAs and block their processing into mature miRNAs (Heo et al., 2008Heo I. Joo C. Cho J. Ha M. Han J. Kim V.N. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 276-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, Newman et al., 2008Newman M.A. Thomson J.M. Hammond S.M.

Chem. 2008; 283: 21310-21314Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Interestingly, let-7 is itself a heterochronic gene in the worm, suggesting that the interaction between Lin28 and let-7 is important for regulating the timing of development. Both lin-28 and let-7 are highly conserved across evolution (Moss et al., 1997Moss E.G. Lee R.C. Ambros V. Cell. 1997; 88: 637-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, Pasquinelli et al., 2000Pasquinelli A.E. Reinhart B.J. Slack F. Martindale M.Q. Kuroda M.I. Maller B. Hayward D.C. Ball E.E. Degnan B. Muller P. et al.Nature. 2000; 408: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar), and recent data are beginning to uncover roles for Lin28 in mammalian development. Several groups have reported the reprogramming of adult human fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells using the same combination of factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC) originally discovered and used by Shinya Yamanaka to reprogram mouse fibroblasts back to a pluripotent state. However, James Thomson's group created iPS cells from adult human fibroblasts using a slightly different cocktail of factors: OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28 (reviewed in Yamanaka, 2008Yamanaka S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2008; 363: 2079-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Together with recent evidence that Lin28 represses the processing of a let-7 precursor into the mature let-7 miRNA, this raises the tantalizing possibility that repression of let-7 is important in establishing the pluripotent state. In support of this notion, the let-7 miRNA is present in low amounts or is absent in a variety of different stem and progenitor cell populations. Furthermore, as organisms age, the self-renewal capacity of their neural stem cells declines, apparently due to an increase in let-7 and a corresponding decrease in the expression of HMGA2, a target gene that is silenced by let-7 (Nishino et al., 2008Nishino J. Kim I. Chada K. Morrison S.J. Cell. 2008; 135: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Mature miRNAs of the let-7 family are poorly expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but their primary let-7 precursor transcripts are readily detected (Thomson et al., 2006Thomson J.M. Newman M. Parker J.S. Morin-Kensicki E.M. Wright T. Hammond S.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar).This suggests that mature let-7 miRNAs are maintained at low levels posttranscriptionally in ESCs and their target genes are not repressed. Recent evidence suggests that let-7 opposes the actions of a family of ESC cell-cycle-regulating miRNAs that maintain self-renewal (Melton et al., 2010Melton C. Judson R.L. Blelloch R. Nature. 2010; 463: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In the reprogramming cocktail used by Yu et al., 2007Yu F. Yao H. Zhu P. Zhang X. Pan Q. Gong C. Huang Y. Hu X. Su F. Lieberman J. Song E. Cell. 2007; 131: 1109-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar, LIN28 functionally replaces c-MYC, and c-MYC is a known target of let-7 (Kumar et al., 2007Kumar M.S. Lu J. Mercer K.L. Golub T.R. Jacks T. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), which supports the notion that LIN28 promotes reprogramming by preventing production of mature let-7 miRNAs. Several reports also indicate that Lin28 can affect protein levels by regulating mRNA stability (Polesskaya et al., 2007Polesskaya A. Cuvellier S. Naguibneva I. Duquet A. Moss E.G. Harel-Bellan A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1125-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2009Xu B. Zhang K. Huang Y. RNA. 2009; 15: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, Qiu et al., 2009Qiu C. Ma Y. Wang J. Peng S. Huang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; (Published online December 4, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp1071Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and that Lin28 directly promotes the translation of OCT4 mRNA (Qiu et al., 2009Qiu C. Ma Y. Wang J. Peng S. Huang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; (Published online December 4, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp1071Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and may modulate cell proliferation by enhancing the translation of various cell-cycle regulators in mouse ESCs (Xu et al., 2009Xu B. Zhang K. Huang Y. RNA. 2009; 15: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, Lin28 may promote reprogramming through both miRNA-dependent and miRNA-independent pathways. In some cases, it is also possible that regulation of mRNA stability may be a secondary consequence of Lin28-mediated modulation of miRNA processing. In addition to c-MYC, several other oncogenes are known to be targets of let-7, including K-Ras and cyclin D1 (reviewed in Roush and Slack, 2008Roush S. Slack F.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 505-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Therefore, let-7 may act as a tumor suppressor miRNA, and its loss has been linked to oncogenesis (Johnson et al., 2005Johnson S.M. Grosshans H. Shingara J. Byrom M. Jarvis R. Cheng A. Labourier E. Reinert K.L. Brown D. Slack F.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar, Takamizawa et al., 2004Takamizawa J. Konishi H. Yanagisawa K. Tomida S. Osada H. Endoh H. Harano T. Yatabe Y. Nagino M. Nimura Y. et al.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3753-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). Mammalian genomes contain multiple let-7 family members processed from distinct precursor transcripts. In settings where let-7 family members are coexpressed and show functional redundancy, genetic events that inactivate individual let-7 members may not have dramatic phenotypic consequences. However, given that LIN28/LIN28B regulates all let-7 family miRNAs, could LIN28/LIN28B contribute to oncogenesis by coordinately inactivating let-7 family miRNAs? We have found that LIN28/LIN28B can promote transformation by repressing let-7 miRNAs, and that activation of LIN28/LIN28B occurs in many different human tumors with a frequency of ∼15% (Viswanathan et al., 2009Viswanathan S.R. Powers J.T. Einhorn W. Hoshida Y. Ng T.L. Toffanin S. O'Sullivan M. Lu J. Phillips L.A. Lockhart V.L. et al.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). It is indeed intriguing, but perhaps no coincidence, that all currently described reprogramming factors—OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC, NANOG, and LIN28—have been linked to oncogenesis. This underscores the notion that the complex genomic reprogramming that accompanies induced pluripotency shares many commonalities with the complex, albeit aberrant, genomic reprogramming that accompanies neoplastic transformation. Strikingly, LIN28 and LIN28B are specifically activated in the subset of tumors that are poorly differentiated and carry the worst prognosis (Viswanathan et al., 2009Viswanathan S.R. Powers J.T. Einhorn W. Hoshida Y. Ng T.L. Toffanin S. O'Sullivan M. Lu J. Phillips L.A. Lockhart V.L. et al.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Aggressive, high-grade tumors are frequently characterized by impaired differentiation, and pathologists often use the differentiation status of a tumor as a metric for scoring cancer severity. When expressed in the proper genetic and epigenetic context, LIN28 together with OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG can promote the reprogramming of a terminally differentiated cell to a pluripotent ESC-like cell. But when aberrantly expressed, LIN28/LIN28B may contribute to the development of an aggressive, poorly differentiated tumor. Indeed, a recent report suggests that several different types of aggressive poorly differentiated tumors, including basal-like breast cancers and high-grade bladder carcinomas, express an ESC-like gene signature (Ben Porath et al., 2008Ben Porath I. Thomson M.W. Carey V.J. Ge R. Bell G.W. Regev A. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). Poorly differentiated tumors might arise either from stem or progenitor cells that acquire additional malignant hits or from somatic cells that dedifferentiate by activating components of the pluripotency machinery (Figure 1). In the case of LIN28B, rare amplification or translocation events might explain activation in some cases (Viswanathan et al., 2009Viswanathan S.R. Powers J.T. Einhorn W. Hoshida Y. Ng T.L. Toffanin S. O'Sullivan M. Lu J. Phillips L.A. Lockhart V.L. et al.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). A more common mechanism, however, might be transcriptional activation by an upstream factor or factors during tumor progression. In support of this notion, c-Myc binds to both the Lin28 (Dangi-Garimella et al., 2009Dangi-Garimella S. Yun J. Eves E.M. Newman M. Erkeland S.J. Hammond S.M. Minn A.J. Rosner M.R. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and LIN28B (Chang et al., 2009Chang T.C. Zeitels L.R. Hwang H.W. Chivukula R.R. Wentzel E.A. Dews M. Jung J. Gao P. Dang C.V. Beer M.A. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 3384-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) loci and activates expression of these genes. However, c-Myc activation in tumors is far more common than LIN28/LIN28B activation—the need for transcriptional coactivators or epigenetic inaccessibility of the LIN28/LIN28B loci may explain this. Finally, in some cases, LIN28/LIN28B may be expressed in a rare somatic progenitor cell of origin that becomes transformed (Figure 1). Regardless of the mechanism of activation, which may vary from tumor to tumor, cancers expressing LIN28/LIN28B appear to be dependent on these proteins for growth (Chang et al., 2009Chang T.C. Zeitels L.R. Hwang H.W. Chivukula R.R. Wentzel E.A. Dews M. Jung J. Gao P. Dang C.V. Beer M.A. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 3384-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, Dangi-Garimella et al., 2009Dangi-Garimella S. Yun J. Eves E.M. Newman M. Erkeland S.J. Hammond S.M. Minn A.J. Rosner M.R. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, Viswanathan et al., 2009Viswanathan S.R. Powers J.T. Einhorn W. Hoshida Y. Ng T.L. Toffanin S. O'Sullivan M. Lu J. Phillips L.A. Lockhart V.L. et al.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The precise manner by which LIN28 contributes to tumorigenesis presents a compelling avenue for future investigation, and there are several intriguing possibilities. Rare breast tumor-initiating cells express low levels of all let-7 family miRNAs (Yu et al., 2007Yu F. Yao H. Zhu P. Zhang X. Pan Q. Gong C. Huang Y. Hu X. Su F. Lieberman J. Song E. Cell. 2007; 131: 1109-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Meanwhile reduced let-7 levels have been shown to confer radioresistance, whereas increased let-7 levels confer radiosensitivity (Weidhaas et al., 2007Weidhaas J.B. Babar I. Nallur S.M. Trang P. Roush S. Boehm M. Gillespie E. Slack F.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11111-11116Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Knocking down LIN28B expression in a radioresistant lung cancer cell line increased let-7 levels and decreased expression of K-RAS, a let-7 target, resulting in enhanced radiosensitivity (Jeong et al., 2009Jeong S.H. Wu H.G. Park W.Y. Exp. Mol. Med. 2009; 41: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, tumor-initiating cells expressing LIN28/LIN28B may persist after chemotherapy and may seed relapse in some patients. Emerging evidence suggests that HMGA2, another target of let-7, actively promotes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key event in development and metastasis (Dangi-Garimella et al., 2009Dangi-Garimella S. Yun J. Eves E.M. Newman M. Erkeland S.J. Hammond S.M. Minn A.J. Rosner M.R. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, Shell et al., 2007Shell S. Park S.M. Radjabi A.R. Schickel R. Kistner E.O. Jewell D.A. Feig C. Lengyel E. Peter M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 11400-11405Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The observation that LIN28 and LIN28B are specifically activated in advanced stage and high-grade tumors suggests that they play a role later during tumorigenesis. Furthermore, Lin28 and let-7 have been placed directly within a metastasis signaling cascade (Dangi-Garimella et al., 2009Dangi-Garimella S. Yun J. Eves E.M. Newman M. Erkeland S.J. Hammond S.M. Minn A.J. Rosner M.R. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Notably, Lin28 shares many parallels with Twist, a factor recently identified as an inducer of EMT and a key mediator of metastasis (Dangi-Garimella et al., 2009Dangi-Garimella S. Yun J. Eves E.M. Newman M. Erkeland S.J. Hammond S.M. Minn A.J. Rosner M.R. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, Mani et al., 2008Mani S.A. Guo W. Liao M.J. Eaton E.N. Ayyanan A.

Both Lin28 and Twist are encoded by developmentally regulated genes, are associated with advanced malignancy and regulatory circuits involving c-Myc, and both strongly cooperate with other oncogenes in assays of cell transformation (Mani et al., 2008Mani S.A. Guo W. Liao M.J. Eaton E.N. Ayyanan A. Zhou A.Y. Brooks M. Reinhard F. Zhang C.C.

Elucidating whether LIN28 and LIN28B have a direct role in promoting metastasis is a potentially rewarding avenue for future work. Several studies place Lin28/Lin28b within an important regulatory network involving c-Myc and let-7 (Chang et al., 2009Chang T.C. Zeitels L.R. Hwang H.W. Chivukula R.R. Wentzel E.A. Dews M. Jung J. Gao P. Dang C.V. Beer M.A. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 3384-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, Dangi-Garimella et al., 2009Dangi-Garimella S. Yun J. Eves E.M. Newman M. Erkeland S.J. Hammond S.M. Minn A.J. Rosner M.R. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Lin28/Lin28b represses let-7, which is itself able to repress Lin28/Lin28b by binding to the 3′UTR of Lin28/Lin28b transcripts, thus forming a double-negative-feedback loop. A second feedback loop exists between Lin28 and c-Myc: Lin28/Lin28b derepresses c-Myc by repressing let-7, and c-Myc transcriptionally activates both Lin28 and Lin28b (Chang et al., 2009Chang T.C. Zeitels L.R. Hwang H.W. Chivukula R.R. Wentzel E.A. Dews M. Jung J. Gao P. Dang C.V. Beer M.A. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

EMBO J. 2009; 28: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Notably, derepression of c-Myc might also contribute to the transcriptional repression of diverse miRNAs and transcriptional activation of certain oncogenic miRNAs (Chang et al., 2008Chang T.C. Yu D.

This Lin28/let-7/c-Myc loop may partially explain the widespread deregulation of miRNAs observed in many human malignancies (Lu et al., 2005Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. et al.Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (7741) Google Scholar). There is also a positive-feedback loop involving NF-κB, Lin28b, let-7, and IL-6: NF-κB induces expression of Lin28b, leading to repression of let-7 and expression of the gene encoding IL-6 (a let-7 target). IL-6 can itself activate NF-κB, completing a positive-feedback loop. In an experimental system, transient induction of the Src tyrosine kinase activates NF-κB and initiates this positive-feedback loop, resulting in neoplastic transformation. This loop operates in cancer cell lines and breast tumor-initiating cells and has been suggested to link the inflammatory response, of which IL-6 is a component, to cancer (Iliopoulos et al., 2009Iliopoulos D. Hirsch H.A. Struhl K. Cell. 2009; 139: 693-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Both of these loops may function in normal development: double negative-feedback loops have been postulated to play a central role in gene regulatory networks by forming “bistable switches” that reinforce binary cell fate decisions (Martinez et al., 2008Martinez N.J. Ow M.C. Barrasa M.I. Hammell M. Sequerra R. Doucette-Stamm L. Roth F.P. Ambros V.R. Walhout A.J.M. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2535-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated LIN28B as a regulator of human development. Hirschhorn and colleagues identified markers near 12 loci that account for 2% of the population variation in human height; 1 of the 12 loci identified was LIN28B, and several other loci encode let-7 targets (Lettre et al., 2008Lettre G. Jackson A.U. Gieger C. Schumacher F.R. Berndt S.I. Sanna S. Eyheramendy S. Voight B.F. Butler J.L. Guiducci C. et al.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). More recently, several independent GWAS have identified common polymorphisms near LIN28B as being associated with a woman's age at menarche (reviewed in Hartge, 2009Hartge P. Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 637-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Together with established data in the worm, the identification of relevant human genetic variations suggests that the Lin28/let-7 axis may be an important regulator of cell growth and development in evolutionarily distant organisms. Subtle variations in the activity of this pathway may result in height or size differences among individuals of the same species, and more dramatic perturbations of this pathway may drive oncogenesis. Thus, Lin28/Lin28b may be similar to PI3-kinase, mTOR, and components of the Hippo pathway, which contribute to the regulation of organ growth and size and may be deregulated in some cancers. Several recent reports suggest that Lin28 may cooperate with a terminal uridylyl transferase (TUTase) to regulate blockade of let-7 production (Figure 2). Lin28 and Lin28b are associated with a TUTase activity that results in the addition of a poly-U tail to the let-7 precursor, pre-let-7 (Heo et al., 2008Heo I. Joo C. Cho J. Ha M. Han J. Kim V.N. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 276-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Uridylated pre-let-7 cannot be efficiently processed by the enzyme Dicer and is targeted for degradation. Three groups have now identified the enzyme responsible for this activity in both mammalian cells (TUT4/zcchc11) (Heo et al., 2009Heo I. Joo C. Kim Y.K. Ha M. Yoon M.J. Cho J. Yeom K.H. Han J. Kim V.N. Cell. 2009; 138: 696-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, Hagan et al., 2009Hagan J.P. Piskounova E. Gregory R.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and in C. elegans (PUP-2) (Lehrbach et al., 2009Lehrbach N.J. Armisen J. Lightfoot H.L. Murfitt K.J. Bugaut A. Balasubramanian S. Miska E.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Together, these reports outline an evolutionarily ancient pathway in which Lin28 recognizes pre-let-7 via a motif in its terminal loop and recruits a TUTase to mark pre-let-7 for degradation. Lin28/TUT4-mediated uridylation of other pre-miRNAs with similar loop motifs has also been reported (Heo et al., 2009Heo I. Joo C. Kim Y.K. Ha M. Yoon M.J. Cho J. Yeom K.H. Han J. Kim V.N. Cell. 2009; 138: 696-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Given that polymerases are facile targets for pharmacological inhibition by small molecules, TUT4 may prove to be an attractive pharmaceutical target for manipulating the LIN28/let-7 axis in cancer cells. The terminal loops of miRNA precursors serve essential regulatory roles (Trabucchi et al., 2009Trabucchi M. Briata P. Garcia-Mayoral M. Haase A.D. Filipowicz W. Ramos A. Gherzi R. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 2009; 459: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, Michlewski et al., 2008Michlewski G. Guil S. Semple C.A. Cßceres J.F. Mol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 21310-21314Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar); for example, hnRNPA1 binds to the terminal loop of pri-miR-18a and enhances Drosha-mediated processing of this precursor into the mature miRNA (Guil and Caceres, 2007Guil S. Caceres J.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The RNA-binding protein KSRP binds to the terminal loop of a subset of miRNAs, including let-7, and enhances their processing (Trabucchi et al., 2009Trabucchi M. Briata P. Garcia-Mayoral M. Haase A.D. Filipowicz W. Ramos A. Gherzi R. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 2009; 459: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is quite likely that the expression of many miRNAs is controlled at the level of processing, with the terminal loop serving as a point of regulation (Michlewski et al., 2008Michlewski G. Guil S. Semple C.A. Cßceres J.F. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 383-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The factors that control miRNA biogenesis are likely to confer an additional layer of precision, complexity, and versatility to gene regulation. The therapeutic targeting of such regulatory factors may be a viable strategy to reduce or enhance the expression of specific miRNAs in the setting of human disease. Recent studies of Lin28 and let-7 have highlighted the fact that normal development, somatic cell reprogramming, and oncogenesis share common pathways. Going forward, it will be critical to define precise roles for Lin28/Lin28b in each of these settings. This will allow us to understand how the Lin28/let-7 pathway functions in physiological development, how it is deregulated during tumorigenesis, and how it can be experimentally exploited to enhance the production of pluripotent cells. More broadly, further investigation of the Lin28/let-7 partnership may lend insight into the mechanisms and consequences of the regulation of miRNA expression by trans-acting factors.

https://openalex.org/W1969884064,"Current models imply that the FERM domain protein Merlin, encoded by the tumor suppressor NF2, inhibits mitogenic signaling at or near the plasma membrane. Here, we show that the closed, growth-inhibitory form of Merlin accumulates in the nucleus, binds to the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4(DCAF1), and suppresses its activity. Depletion of DCAF1 blocks the promitogenic effect of inactivation of Merlin. Conversely, enforced expression of a Merlin-insensitive mutant of DCAF1 counteracts the antimitogenic effect of Merlin. Re-expression of Merlin and silencing of DCAF1 implement a similar, tumor-suppressive program of gene expression. Tumor-derived mutations invariably disrupt Merlin's ability to interact with or inhibit CRL4(DCAF1). Finally, depletion of DCAF1 inhibits the hyperproliferation of Schwannoma cells from NF2 patients and suppresses the oncogenic potential of Merlin-deficient tumor cell lines. We propose that Merlin suppresses tumorigenesis by translocating to the nucleus to inhibit CRL4(DCAF1)."
https://openalex.org/W2171824086,"The molecular mechanisms regulating the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) at synapses are poorly understood. We report that CaMKIIα—an abundant postsynaptic protein kinase—mediates the activity-dependent recruitment of proteasomes to dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons.

CaMKIIα translocation to synapses is required for activity-induced proteasome accumulation in spines, and is sufficient to redistribute proteasomes to postsynaptic sites. CaMKIIα autophosphorylation enhances its binding to proteasomes and promotes proteasome recruitment to spines. In addition to this structural role, CaMKIIα stimulates proteasome activity by phosphorylating proteasome subunit Rpt6 on Serine 120. However, CaMKIIα translocation, but not its kinase activity, is required for activity-dependent degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins in spines.

The protein kinase CaMKIIα associates with proteasomes in the brain CaMKIIα translocation to synapses is required for proteasome redistribution Autophosphorylated CaMKIIα acts as a scaffold to promote proteasome recruitment CaMKIIα is required for activity-induced protein turnover in spines Synapses between neurons can change functionally and structurally in response to activity – a process known as synaptic plasticity. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a multi-functional enzyme of central importance for synaptic plasticity (Lisman et al., 2002Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. The molecular basis of CaMKII function in synaptic and behavioural memory.Nature Reviews. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), and the most abundant protein in the postsynaptic density (PSD) (Cheng et al., 2006Cheng D. Hoogenraad C.C. Rush J. Ramm E. Schlager M.A. Duong D.M. Xu P. Wijayawardana S.R. Hanfelt J. Nakagawa T. et al.Relative and absolute quantification of PSD proteome isolated from rat forebrain and cerebellum.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 1158-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). CaMKII becomes autophosphorylated on Thr-286 and constitutively active following synaptic excitation and it maintains its enzymatic activity even after calcium levels have returned to baseline levels, thus potentially functioning as a molecular memory trace in stimulated synapses. Activated CaMKII phosphorylates AMPA receptors and other PSD proteins, which likely contributes to enhancement of synaptic strength (Lisman et al., 2002Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. The molecular basis of CaMKII function in synaptic and behavioural memory.Nature Reviews. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The predominant isoforms in neurons, CaMKIIα and -β, form either CaMKIIα homomultimers or CaMKIIα and -β heteromultimers (Brocke et al., 1999Brocke L. Chiang L.W. Wagner P.D. Schulman H. Functional implications of the subunit composition of neuronal CaM kinase II.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22713-22722Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). CaMKIIβ predominates in early brain development and it promotes neurite extension (Fink et al., 2003Fink C.C. Bayer K.U. Myers J.W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Schulman H. Meyer T. Selective regulation of neurite extension and synapse formation by the β but not the α isoform of CaMKII.Neuron. 2003; 39: 283-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) whereas CaMKIIα is expressed postnatally during brain maturation and stabilizes dendritic arbor structure (Wu and Cline, 1998Wu G.Y. Cline H.T. Stabilization of dendritic arbor structure in vivo by CaMKII.Science. 1998; 279: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). CaMKIIα and -β are also regulated by neuronal activity with respect to their subcellular localization. Both isoforms show activity-dependent redistribution from the dendritic shaft to spines (Shen and Meyer, 1999Shen K. Meyer T. Dynamic control of CaMKII translocation and localization in hippocampal neurons by NMDA receptor stimulation.Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). CaMKIIα accumulates in the PSD during LTP (Otmakhov et al., 2004Otmakhov N. Tao-Cheng J.H. Carpenter S. Asrican B. Dosemeci A. Reese T.S. Lisman J. Persistent accumulation of CaMKII in dendritic spines after induction of NMDA receptor-dependent chemical LTP.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9324-9331Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and ischemia (Kolb et al., 1995Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Waxham M.N. CaMKII translocates in a hippocampal slice model of ischemia.J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The remarkable abundance of CaMKII at synapses (up to 8% of mass of PSD [Cheng et al., 2006Cheng D. Hoogenraad C.C. Rush J. Ramm E. Schlager M.A. Duong D.M. Xu P. Wijayawardana S.R. Hanfelt J. Nakagawa T. et al.Relative and absolute quantification of PSD proteome isolated from rat forebrain and cerebellum.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 1158-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar]) strongly suggests a structural role for CaMKII at synapses. In line with this idea, CaMKIIβ isoform appears to directly bundle F-actin in spines, and is crucial for maintenance of dendritic spine morphology (Okamoto et al., 2007Okamoto K. Narayanan R. Lee S.H. Murata K. Hayashi Y. The role of CaMKII as an F-actin-bundling protein crucial for maintenance of dendritic spine structure.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 6418-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A structural function has not been discovered for CaMKIIα. The majority of protein degradation in cells occurs via the UPS, in which conjugation of a polyubiquitin chain via K48 linkage marks the protein substrate for degradation by the 26S proteasome. In response to altered cellular needs, proteasomes undergo dynamic changes in their subcellular localization and composition, and their function can be altered by posttranslational modifications and interacting proteins (Bingol and Schuman, 2006Bingol B.

In neurons, several specific UPS substrates have been identified whose degradation affect synaptic development and plasticity (Bingol and Schuman, 2005Bingol B. Schuman E.M. Synaptic protein degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In a general sense, long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and memory rely on proteasomes to degrade proteins (Colledge et al., 2003Colledge M. Snyder E.M. Crozier R.A.

Neurosci. 2001; 14: 1820-1826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, activity-dependent changes in PSD composition during long term homeostatic plasticity requires proteasome function (Ehlers, 2003Ehlers M.D. Activity level controls postsynaptic composition and signaling via the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Following synaptic excitation, the proteasome redistributes rapidly to spines from the dendritic shaft and becomes more proteolytically active (Bingol and Schuman, 2006Bingol B. Schuman E.M. Activity-dependent dynamics and sequestration of proteasomes in dendritic spines.Nature. 2006; 441: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the redistribution and activation of proteasomes in response to neuronal activity in neurons? Here we report that CaMKIIα, a well-studied enzyme critical for neuronal plasticity, can act as a scaffold for proteasomes at synapses. We present evidence that activated, autophosphorylated CaMKIIα–independent of its kinase activity toward heterologous substrates–mediates postsynaptic recruitment of proteasomes. CaMKIIα binds to proteasomes, and its translocation to synapses is both necessary and sufficient for proteasome redistribution to spines. Additionally, CaMKIIα, functioning as a kinase, enhances proteasome proteolytic activity by phosphorylating Serine-120 of Rpt6 subunit of 19S proteasome. However, it is CaMKIIα redistribution, rather than its kinase activity, that is required for the activity-dependent degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins at postsynaptic sites. To obtain insight into molecular mechanisms of proteasome regulation in neurons, we searched for proteasome-associated proteins in brain by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of purified proteasome complexes. Proteasomes were affinity-purified from synaptosome-enriched fraction of rat forebrain (at almost 100% efficiency) using the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain of Rad23, which binds to the 19S subunit of the proteasome (Schauber et al., 1998Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Rad23 links DNA repair to the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway.Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Control columns charged with GST alone failed to precipitate the proteasome (Figure 1A , Figures S1A and S1B). Proteins were eluted with 2M NaCl/2% Triton-X, and examined by MS (Choe et al., 2007Choe E.A. Liao L. Zhou J.Y. Cheng D. Duong D.M. Jin P. Tsai L.H. Peng J. Neuronal morphogenesis is regulated by the interplay between cdk5 and the ubiquitin ligase mind bomb 1.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9503-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In GST-UBL eluates, the highest number of peptides identified by MS corresponded to all 6 ATPase subunits and 11 of 14 non-ATPase subunits of the 19S proteasome (Table S1). No proteasome peptides were identified in eluates from control GST columns. Consistent with the known interactions between the ubiquitin conjugation/removal machinery and the proteasome (Glickman et al., 1998Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. The regulatory particle of the S. cerevisiae proteasome.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ubiquitin-ligases (E3s) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) were also identified in GST-UBL eluates (Kcmf1, Rnf43 and Rab40C E3s, and Usp5, −14, −52 and −53 DUBs). Notably, some proteins identified in GST-UBL eluates confirmed previously identified proteasome interacting proteins in non-neuronal cells (heat shock protein 8, elongation factor Tu, ribosomal protein L10, and Usp5 and −14 DUBs (Bousquet-Dubouch et al., 2009Bousquet-Dubouch M.P.

Several other proteins were also identified in GST-UBL precipitates with multiple peptide “hits” (Table S1). Among these we were particularly interested in CaMKIIα, an activity-regulated protein kinase that, like the proteasome, redistributes to synapses with synaptic stimulation (Bingol and Schuman, 2006Bingol B. Schuman E.M. Activity-dependent dynamics and sequestration of proteasomes in dendritic spines.Nature. 2006; 441: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, Shen and Meyer, 1999Shen K. Meyer T. Dynamic control of CaMKII translocation and localization in hippocampal neurons by NMDA receptor stimulation.Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). We confirmed that CaMKII was copurified with the proteasome by immunoblotting. CaMKIIα was consistently present in the GST-UBL precipitate, whereas CaMKIIβ was detectable in half of the experiments (Figure 1B; 3.9 ± 0.5% of total input CaMKIIα was precipitated by GST-UBL beads, versus 90.0 ± 4.0% of proteasome subunit Rpt1 and 95.2 ± 3.5% of Rpt6; n = 8 experiments). Columns charged with GST alone or with GST-RhoA failed to precipitate CaMKIIα (Figures 1B and 1C). Accordingly, neither CaMKIIα nor β was detected by MS in eluates from GST-alone beads. Other abundant cytoplasmic enzymes such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and Extracellular Signal-Regulated kinase (ERK), and membrane proteins such as AMPA receptor subunit GluR2, were not detected in GST-UBL precipitates (Figure 1B), indicating some specificity in the association of CaMKII with UBL. Two amino acid substitutions in UBL that render it unable to bind to the 19S proteasome (L8E, K45E (Goh et al., 2008Goh A.M. Walters K.J. Elsasser S. Verma R. Deshaies R.J. Finley D. Howley P.M. Components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway compete for surfaces on Rad23 family proteins.BMC Biochem. 2008; 9: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) also failed to precipitate CaMKIIα or β, further supporting that CaMKII associates specifically with the proteasome (Figure 1D). Similar to other proteasome interacting proteins, CaMKIIα and proteasome association was inhibited by addition of ATP, confirming the interaction between CaMKIIα and the proteasome is real and not due to non-specific binding of CaMKIIα to GST-UBL beads. (Verma et al., 2000Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Proteasomal proteomics: identification of nucleotide-sensitive proteasome-interacting proteins by mass spectrometric analysis of affinity-purified proteasomes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) (Figure 1E). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation (IP) of proteasomes from P2 lysates with Rpt6 antibody co-IPed CaMKIIα, but not GAPDH (Figure 1F). CaMKIIβ was not detectably coprecipitated with Rpt6 antibodies (data not shown). Thus, these data collectively indicate that a subset of CaMKIIα is specifically complexed with proteasomes in the brain. If CaMKIIα interacts with proteasomes, they should colocalize at least in part within neurons. We immunostained cultured hippocampal neurons, using anti-Rpt3 (19S proteasome) and anti-CaMKIIα antibodies (Bingol and Schuman, 2006Bingol B. Schuman E.M. Activity-dependent dynamics and sequestration of proteasomes in dendritic spines.Nature. 2006; 441: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Both proteins showed a widespread punctate distribution in dendrites, and we observed that most CaMKIIα puncta overlapped with Rpt3, and vice versa (Figure 1G). To confirm that the observed overlap of CaMKIIα and proteasome staining reflected a real colocalization, rather than a random coincidence of these two signals, we “randomized” the distribution of proteasome particles over the dendritic area while keeping the CaMKIIα signal fixed (Figure S1C, D). The actual observed colocalization was significantly higher than when the proteasome was randomly distributed along the same dendritic segment (Figure 1G, overlap signal shown in “heat” color scale). The difference between actual overlap and random overlap was +35 ± 4% for Rpt3 and CaMKIIα (compared to +50 ± 2% for Bassoon and CaMKIIα, which are both known to concentrate at excitatory synapses) versus −49 ± 11% for PSD-95 and VGAT (which are segregated at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively) (Figure 1H, Figures S1E and S1F), confirming the validity of this method. Thus, CaMKIIα shows real and significant colocalization with proteasomes in neuronal dendrites, consistent with possible interaction in the postsynaptic compartment. To examine whether CaMKII regulates the activity-dependent proteasome localization to spines, we monitored the distribution of monomeric green fluorescent protein (mGFP)-tagged 19S proteasome subunit Rpt1 (Rpt1-GFP) by time-lapse imaging in cultured hippocampal neurons transfected additionally with various CaMKII expression plasmids (Bingol and Schuman, 2006Bingol B. Schuman E.M. Activity-dependent dynamics and sequestration of proteasomes in dendritic spines.Nature. 2006; 441: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, Rpt1-GFP was distributed approximately uniformly in dendritic shaft and spines. In control neurons (transfected with empty vector or β-Gal), NMDA stimulation (30 μM, 3 min) induced a rapid and persistent Rpt1-GFP redistribution from dendritic shaft into spines (Figure 2). Compared to control cells, Rpt1-GFP in CaMKIIα- or CaMKIIβ-transfected neurons exhibited a significantly greater degree of accumulation in spines in response to NMDA stimulation at all time points examined (Figure 2). Thus overexpression of CaMKII enhances activity-dependent recruitment of proteasomes to spines. To test if CaMKII is required for activity-dependent proteasome distribution to spines, we used pSuper-based RNA interference (RNAi) to express small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting CaMKIIα or CaMKIIβ (Okamoto et al., 2007Okamoto K. Narayanan R. Lee S.H. Murata K. Hayashi Y. The role of CaMKII as an F-actin-bundling protein crucial for maintenance of dendritic spine structure.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 6418-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In neurons, these RNAi constructs knocked down the respective CaMKII isoforms by ∼70%, based on immunostaining (Figure S2A, B). In neurons transfected with a control RNAi construct targeting luciferase (luc-RNAi) (Seeburg et al., 2008Seeburg D.P. Feliu-Mojer M. Gaiottino J. Pak D.T. Sheng M. Critical role of CDK5 and Polo-like kinase 2 in homeostatic synaptic plasticity during elevated activity.Neuron. 2008; 58: 571-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), Rpt1-GFP showed normal redistribution from shaft to spines in response to NMDA, quantitatively similar to untransfected neurons (Figures 3A and 3C ). Neurons transfected with CaMKIIα-RNAi showed significantly impaired Rpt1-GFP accumulation, whereas knockdown of CaMKIIβ had no effect (Figures 3A and 3C). Cotransfection of an RNAi-resistant CaMKIIα construct (CaMKIIα∗), but not an unrelated protein, β-Gal, rescued the Rpt1-GFP redistribution defect caused by CaMKIIα-RNAi (Figure 3A, C). In fact, neurons cotransfected with CaMKIIα∗ plus CaMKIIα-RNAi showed higher levels of proteasome accumulation than control neurons, similar to neurons overexpressing wild-type CaMKIIα in the absence of CaMKIIα-RNAi (Figure 2). The crucial role of CaMKIIα in proteasome redistribution was also confirmed using a “chemical LTP” protocol to stimulate synapses (Lu et al., 2001Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F.

See also Figure S2, Figure S3, Figure S6. As previously reported, shRNA suppression of CaMKIIβ made dendritic spines longer and thinner (Fink et al., 2003Fink C.C. Bayer K.U. Myers J.W.

USA. 2007; 104: 6418-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in CaMKIIβ-RNAi transfected neurons, proteasomes still accumulated in these thin spines to the same extent as in luc-RNAi control neurons (Figures 3A and 3C). Reduced spine size could not explain the absence of CaMKIIβ-RNAi effect on proteasome redistribution because in our analysis the Rpt1-GFP intensity in each spine is normalized to its own baseline to quantify the temporal change. Thus, these data collectively indicate that CaMKIIα not only promotes, but also is required, for activity-dependent proteasome accumulation in spines, with little contribution from CaMKIIβ. How does CaMKIIα lead to proteasome accumulation in spines? Following stimulation, CaMKIIα redistribution to spines occurs within tens of seconds of stimulation onset (Shen and Meyer, 1999Shen K. Meyer T. Dynamic control of CaMKII translocation and localization in hippocampal neurons by NMDA receptor stimulation.Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). However, the increase in the proteasome accumulation in spines occurs more slowly, within minutes (Bingol and Schuman, 2006Bingol B. Schuman E.M. Activity-dependent dynamics and sequestration of proteasomes in dendritic spines.Nature. 2006; 441: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We confirmed the temporal difference in CaMKIIα and proteasome redistribution by monitoring the dynamics of Rpt1-GFP and mCherry-tagged CaMKIIα in the same neurons (data not shown). Because CaMKIIα redistribution occurred more rapidly than proteasome accumulation, we hypothesized that CaMKIIα does not “convey” proteasomes directly to postsynaptic sites, but rather that translocated CaMKIIα provides a postsynaptic scaffold for binding of proteasomes, leading to local accumulation. To examine directly whether CaMKIIα can stabilize proteasomes in spines following activity, we measured Rpt1-GFP fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in spines of neurons expressing CaMKIIα-RNAi or control luciferase-RNAi (Figure S2E and S2F). In luciferase-RNAi expressing neurons, NMDA stimulation decreased the mobile fraction of the proteasomes from ∼70% to ∼15%, indicating strong stabilization of proteasomes in spines by NMDA. This NMDA-induced proteasome immobilization was blocked by knockdown of CaMKIIα and rescued by coexpressing CaMKIIα∗ (but not β-Gal) with CaMKIIα-RNAi (Figures S2E and S2F). Thus CaMKIIα stabilizes proteasomes"
https://openalex.org/W2013657751,"Intestinal barrier function is reduced in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-13, which are up-regulated in IBD, induce barrier defects that are associated with myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) activation and increased claudin-2 expression, respectively, in cultured intestinal epithelial monolayers. Here we report that these independent signaling pathways have distinct effects on tight junction barrier properties and interact in vivo. MLCK activation alters size selectivity to enhance paracellular flux of uncharged macromolecules without affecting charge selectivity and can be rapidly reversed by MLCK inhibition. In contrast, IL-13-dependent claudin-2 expression increases paracellular cation flux in vitro and in vivo without altering tight junction size selectivity but is unaffected by MLCK inhibition in vitro. In vivo, MLCK activation increases paracellular flux of uncharged macromolecules and also triggers IL-13 expression, claudin-2 synthesis, and increased paracellular cation flux. We conclude that reversible, MLCK-dependent permeability increases cause mucosal immune activation that, in turn, feeds back on the tight junction to establish long-lasting barrier defects. Interactions between these otherwise distinct tight junction regulatory pathways may contribute to IBD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2030197516,"Genetic and cell-based studies have implicated the PAF1 complex (PAF1C) in transcription-associated events, but there has been no evidence showing a direct role in facilitating transcription of a natural chromatin template. Here, we demonstrate an intrinsic ability of human PAF1C (hPAF1C) to facilitate activator (p53)- and histone acetyltransferase (p300)-dependent transcription elongation from a recombinant chromatin template in a biochemically defined RNA polymerase II transcription system. This represents a PAF1C function distinct from its established role in histone ubiquitylation and methylation. Importantly, we further demonstrate a strong synergy between hPAF1C and elongation factor SII/TFIIS and an underlying mechanism involving direct hPAF1C-SII interactions and cooperative binding to RNA polymerase II. Apart from a distinct PAF1C function, the present observations provide a molecular mechanism for the cooperative function of distinct transcription elongation factors in chromatin transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2033184388,"Nascent transport intermediates detach from donor membranes by scission. This process can take place in the absence of dynamin, notably in clathrin-independent endocytosis, by mechanisms that are yet poorly defined. We show here that in cells scission of Shiga toxin-induced tubular endocytic membrane invaginations is preceded by cholesterol-dependent membrane reorganization and correlates with the formation of membrane domains on model membranes, suggesting that domain boundary forces are driving tubule membrane constriction. Actin triggers scission by inducing such membrane reorganization process. Tubule occurrence is indeed increased upon cellular depletion of the actin nucleator component Arp2, and the formation of a cortical actin shell in liposomes is sufficient to trigger the scission of Shiga toxin-induced tubules in a cholesterol-dependent but dynamin-independent manner. Our study suggests that membranes in tubular Shiga toxin-induced invaginations are poised to undergo actin-triggered reorganization leading to scission by a physical mechanism that may function independently from or in synergy with pinchase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2120204041,"Initially acquired memory dissipates rapidly if not consolidated. Such memory decay is thought to result either from the inherently labile nature of newly acquired memories or from interference by subsequently attained information. Here we report that a small G protein Rac-dependent forgetting mechanism contributes to both passive memory decay and interference-induced forgetting in Drosophila. Inhibition of Rac activity leads to slower decay of early memory, extending it from a few hours to more than one day, and to blockade of interference-induced forgetting. Conversely, elevated Rac activity in mushroom body neurons accelerates memory decay. This forgetting mechanism does not affect memory acquisition and is independent of Rutabaga adenylyl cyclase-mediated memory formation mechanisms. Endogenous Rac activation is evoked on different time scales during gradual memory loss in passive decay and during acute memory removal in reversal learning. We suggest that Rac's role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling may contribute to memory erasure."
https://openalex.org/W2096272013,"Activation of an apical Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) channel (CaCC) is the rate-limiting step for fluid secretion in many exocrine tissues. Here, we compared the properties of native CaCC in mouse submandibular salivary gland acinar cells to the Ca(2+)-gated Cl(-) currents generated by Tmem16A and Best2, members from two distinct families of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels found in salivary glands. Heterologous expression of Tmem16A and Best2 transcripts in HEK293 cells produced Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents with time and voltage dependence and inhibitor sensitivity that resembled the Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current found in native salivary acinar cells. Best2(-/-) and Tmem16A(-/-) mice were used to further characterize the role of these channels in the exocrine salivary gland. The amplitude and the biophysical footprint of the Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current in submandibular gland acinar cells from Best2-deficient mice were the same as in wild type cells. Consistent with this observation, the fluid secretion rate in Best2 null mice was comparable with that in wild type mice. In contrast, submandibular gland acinar cells from Tmem16A(-/-) mice lacked a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current and a Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonist failed to stimulate Cl(-) efflux, requirements for fluid secretion. Furthermore, saliva secretion was abolished by the CaCC inhibitor niflumic acid in wild type and Best2(-/-) mice. Our results demonstrate that both Tmem16A and Best2 generate Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current in vitro with similar properties to those expressed in native cells, yet only Tmem16A appears to be a critical component of the acinar Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel complex that is essential for saliva production by the submandibular gland."
https://openalex.org/W2163361011,"Skeletal myogenesis, like hematopoiesis, occurs in successive developmental stages that involve different cell populations and expression of different genes. We show here that the transcription factor nuclear factor one X (Nfix), whose expression is activated by Pax7 in fetal muscle, in turn activates the transcription of fetal specific genes such as MCK and beta-enolase while repressing embryonic genes such as slow myosin. In the case of the MCK promoter, Nfix forms a complex with PKC theta that binds, phosphorylates, and activates MEF2A. Premature expression of Nfix activates fetal and suppresses embryonic genes in embryonic muscle, whereas muscle-specific ablation of Nfix prevents fetal and maintains embryonic gene expression in the fetus. Therefore, Nfix acts as a transcriptional switch from embryonic to fetal myogenesis."

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, plants, and Drosophila, small RNA pathways also act at the chromatin or DNA level (Moazed, 2009Moazed D. Small RNAs in transcriptional gene silencing and genome defence.Nature. 2009; 457: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar).

In the S. pombe RITS complex, Argonaute interacts with two additional proteins, Tas3 and Chp1. Tas3, a glycine and tryptophan (GW) motif-containing protein, links Ago1 to Chp1 (Debeauchamp et al., 2008Debeauchamp J.L. Moses A. Noffsinger V.J. Ulrich D.L. Job G. Kosinski A.M. Partridge J.F.

Chp1 is a chromodomain-containing protein and specifically interacts with histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) di- or trimethylated nucleosomes (Partridge et al., 2002Partridge J.F. Scott K.S. Bannister A.J.

RITS can therefore associate with chromatin through base-pairing interactions of siRNAs in Ago1 with nascent transcripts and interaction of Chp1 with H3K9 methylated nucleosomes (Verdel et al., 2004Verdel A.

This leads to the recruitment of the Clr4-Rik1-Cul4 (CLRC) methyltransferase/ubiquitin ligase complex to chromatin, additional cycles of H3K9 methylation, and recruitment of two other chromodomain proteins, Swi6 and Chp2, which are the fission yeast HP1 homologs. In addition to RITS, S. pombe contains an Argonaute siRNA chaperone (ARC) complex, in which Ago1 is associated with the Arb1 and Arb2 proteins and duplex siRNAs (Buker et al., 2007Buker S.M. Iida T.

In the nascent transcript cycle described above, the RNAi machinery localizes to chromatin-bound transcripts and mediates their processing into siRNAs, which promote heterochromatin assembly and the generation of additional siRNAs. However, it remains unclear how siRNA generation and heterochromatin assembly are initiated in the first place, since the cycle begins with an siRNA-programmed RITS. It has been suggested that trigger centromeric siRNAs are produced from the processing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which may form either by base pairing of sense and antisense centromeric transcripts or by RDRC-dependent activity on specific centromeric RNAs (Figure 1A ). In an alternative model, low levels of histone H3K9 methylation, which are present in RNAi mutants (Noma et al., 2004Noma K. Sugiyama T. Cam H. Verdel A. Zofall M. Jia S. Moazed D. Grewal S.I.

In this report, we use biochemical and high-throughput sequencing approaches to examine the mechanisms that mediate small RNA generation from the fission yeast centromeric repeat sequences. The higher sensitivity of the methods used in our experiments allows us to detect centromeric small RNAs in mutant backgrounds that had been considered to lack siRNAs. We demonstrate the existence of two Ago1-dependent pathways that mediate the generation of different levels of small RNAs from centromeric repeat sequences. First, small RNA profiles in heterochromatin mutants indicate that the amplification of siRNAs can occur independently of H3K9 methylation and involves RDRC and Dicer activity on specific noncoding RNAs. This amplification requires the slicer activity of Ago1, suggesting that the Ago1-associated small RNAs target RDRC to centromeric transcripts. Second, we describe a distinct class of small RNAs, called primal small RNAs (priRNAs), which are generated independently of Dicer or RDRC. priRNAs appear to be degradation products of abundant genome-wide transcripts. We provide evidence that priRNAs act through Argonaute to mediate low levels of H3K9 methylation at pericentromeric repeats and propose that they trigger RDRC/Dicer-dependent siRNA amplification from antisense centromeric RNAs. In addition, we provide evidence that siRNAs undergo processing at their 3′ ends, which involves the addition of untemplated nucleotides by the Cid12 and Cid14 nucleotidyltransferases and trimming, most likely mediated by the exosome. Our results suggest that a transcriptome surveillance mechanism based on the random association of small RNAs with Argonautes triggers RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation within DNA repeats. Several different models can explain how trigger siRNAs are first generated from centromeric transcripts (Figure 1A). In model 1, siRNAs are generated by Dicer-mediated processing of dsRNA that is formed from base pairing of sense and antisense centromeric transcripts resulting from bidirectional transcription. In model 2, RDRC recognizes specific features of centromeric RNAs and synthesizes the initial dsRNA substrate for Dicer. In model 3, pre-existing H3K9 methylation recruits RITS and RDRC to transcripts in centromeric regions in an siRNA-independent manner. These models make specific predictions about siRNA levels in different mutant backgrounds. However, previous studies employing 3′ end labeling and northern blotting, while showing a requirement for RDRC/Dicer and heterochromatin proteins in centromeric siRNA generation, have not detected differences in siRNA levels in the respective mutant backgrounds (Bühler et al., 2006Bühler M.

RNAi-mediated targeting of heterochromatin by the RITS complex.Science. 2004; 303: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). In order to distinguish between the above models, we used the sensitive splinted ligation detection assays to determine siRNA levels in FLAG-Ago1 purifications from Dicer, RDRC, and heterochromatin mutant cells (Figure 1B, Figure S1A available online). In splinted ligation detection assays, small RNAs are ligated to a 5′ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, directed by a specific bridge oligonucleotide, and the detection has been reported to be approximately 50-fold more sensitive than northern blotting for small RNA (Maroney et al., 2008Maroney P.A. Chamnongpol S. Souret F. Nilsen T.W. Direct detection of small RNAs using splinted ligation.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Using this method, we observed >100-fold reduction in siRNA levels in dcr1Δ, rdp1Δ, cid12Δ, clr4Δ, and tas3Δ cells (Figures 1B and 1C, Figure S1B). siRNA levels were also greatly reduced in cells lacking the Arb1 and Arb2 subunits of the ARC complex, the Chp1 subunit of the RITS complex, the Rik1 subunit of the CLRC methyltransferase complex, and the Swi6/HP1 protein (Figures 1B and 1C). In contrast to previous studies, we detected small RNAs in dcr1Δ, rdp1Δ, and several other mutant backgrounds that were consistently above control FLAG immunoprecipitations from either untagged wild-type or dcr1Δ cells (Figures 1C and 1D, Figure S1B). In rdp1Δ and dcr1Δ cells, small RNA levels were similar, suggesting that few or no siRNAs were produced from dsRNA resulting from the base pairing of sense and antisense centromeric transcripts, strongly arguing against model 1 (Figures 1B–1D, Figure S1B). Furthermore, the presence of small RNAs in dcr1Δ cells suggested the existence of a Dicer-independent small RNA generation mechanism in S. pombe. The splinted ligation results suggested that high-throughput sequencing of Ago1-associated small RNAs from mutant cells may provide additional information about the factors and centromeric sequences that mediate small RNA biogenesis. Using Illumina sequencing, we obtained between one and six million reads for 5′-monopohosphate containing small RNAs associated with FLAG-Ago1 in wild-type and mutant cells (Figures 2A and 2B , Table S1). Consistent with previous results (Bühler et al., 2008Bühler M. Spies N. Bartel D.P. Moazed D.

In addition, we observed a striking correlation between small RNA peaks and the occurrence of both sense and antisense transcription (Figure S2A). The majority of the remaining small RNA reads mapped to the sense strand of rRNAs, tRNAs, and mRNAs (Figure 2A). Consistent with the splinted ligation results (Figures 1B–1D), in dcr1Δ, rdp1Δ, and cid12Δ cells, centromeric small RNAs were severely reduced but not eliminated (Figures 2A and 2B). The residual small RNAs in the above mutant backgrounds had a similar 5′ nucleotide preference and length distribution as wild-type siRNAs suggesting that this preference was dictated by Ago1 binding (Figure S2B and data not shown).Figure S2Role of Dicer and RDRC in Small RNA Generation, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Upper panel.

Cid12 increases the size of oligonucleotide by one nucleotide, suggesting that it can only incorporate a single nucleotide at the 3′ end of its RNA template. In cid12Δ cells, about 10-fold more centromeric siRNAs were present compared to dcr1Δ or rdp1Δ cells (Figures 2A and 2B, zoomed graphs), suggesting that low levels of siRNA could be generated independently of Cid12. Moreover, overexpression of Rdp1 from the strong nmt1 promoter in cid12Δ cells restored centromeric dg and dh siRNAs to near wild-type levels (Figure 2C, Figures S2C and S2D) and restored silencing of an imr1R::ura4+ centromeric reporter gene (Figure 2D), indicating that the resulting siRNAs were functional. However, Rdp1 overexpression failed to restore the normally abundant siRNAs corresponding to the IRC3 repeats of chromosome 3, indicating an essential role for Cid12 in RNAi at this element (Figure S2C). Furthermore, Rdp1 overexpression did not suppress the silencing defect of other RNAi mutant cells (Figure S2E), suggesting that the mechanism of this suppression was specifically related to a partial bypass of Cid12 function in the RDRC complex. Cid12 is one of two nucleotidyltransferase enzymes that are required for efficient RNAi in S. pombe (Motamedi et al., 2004Motamedi M.R. Verdel A. Colmenares S.U. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Moazed D. Two RNAi complexes, RITS and RDRC, physically interact and localize to noncoding centromeric RNAs.Cell. 2004; 119: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Cid14, another enzyme in this family, is a component of the TRAMP polyadenylation complex and is required for efficient siRNA generation and heterochromatic gene silencing (Bühler et al., 2007Bühler M. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Moazed D. RNAi-dependent and -independent RNA turnover mechanisms contribute to heterochromatic gene silencing.Cell. 2007; 129: 707-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although previous evidence suggests that Cid12 and Cid14 perform overlapping and/or competing functions (Bühler et al., 2007Bühler M. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Moazed D. RNAi-dependent and -independent RNA turnover mechanisms contribute to heterochromatic gene silencing.Cell. 2007; 129: 707-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), it has been unclear whether they target long noncoding RNAs or siRNAs. We noticed that a strikingly high percentage of Ago1-bound small RNAs contained mismatches at their 3′ last two nucleotides (Figure 2E, positions 0 and −1 from the 3′ end), raising the possibility that Cid12 and/or Cid14 extended the 3′ ends of these small RNAs in a template independent manner. In wild-type cells, the mismatch residues were A, U, or C (Figure 2F), but both the frequency and identity of the mismatches were altered in mutant backgrounds (Figures 2E and 2F). In both cid12Δ and cid14Δ cells, the frequency of mismatches at the last two 3′ nucleotide positions of total and centromeric small RNA populations was reduced (Figure 2E), suggesting that small RNAs were targeted by the nucleotidyltransferase activities of Cid12 and Cid14. Finally, we observed changes in the identity of mismatched residues in mutant backgrounds (Figure 2F, Figure S2F). In dcr1Δ and cid12Δ cells, the mismatch residue was primarily A (Figure 2F), suggesting that in the absence of heterochromatin-dependent processing, small RNAs become targets for Cid14, which has primarily polyadenylation activity in vitro (Bühler et al., 2007Bühler M. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Moazed D. RNAi-dependent and -independent RNA turnover mechanisms contribute to heterochromatic gene silencing.Cell. 2007; 129: 707-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In contrast, in cid14Δ cells, mismatches were primarily U or A, and to a lesser extent C (Figure 2F), suggesting a role for another nucleotidyltransferase, possibly Cid12. To address the possibility that Cid12 has nucleotidyltransferase activity, we reconstituted RDRC complexes containing active site mutations in either the Cid12 or Rdp1 subunits so that we could distinguish Cid12 activity from Rdp1 activity. We were unable to detect any adenylation activity in purified Cid12 preparations (Figure 2G, lane 5). However, Cid12 had robust adenylation activity when assembled into the RDRC complex, containing either wild-type Rdp1 or catalytically inactive Rdp1D903A (Figure 2G, lanes 1, 3, and 4), suggesting that Cid12 activity was allosterically regulated. The RNA template, rather than the synthesized second strand, was the target of adenylation by Cid12, since adenylation did not require the dsRNA synthesis activity of Rdp1"
https://openalex.org/W2045650137,"Cry toxins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis have been recognized as pore-forming toxins whose primary action is to lyse midgut epithelial cells in their target insect. In the case of the Cry1A toxins, a prepore oligomeric intermediate is formed after interaction with cadherin receptor. The Cry1A oligomer then interacts with glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptors. Two Manduca sexta glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, aminopeptidase (APN) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), have been shown to bind Cry1Ab, although their role in toxicity remains to be determined. Detection of Cry1Ab binding proteins by ligand blot assay revealed that ALP is preferentially expressed earlier during insect development, because it was found in the first larval instars, whereas APN is induced later after the third larval instar. The binding of Cry1Ab oligomer to pure preparations of APN and ALP showed that this toxin structure interacts with both receptors with high affinity (apparent K(d) = 0.6 nM), whereas the monomer showed weaker binding (apparent K(d) = 101.6 and 267.3 nM for APN and ALP, respectively). Several Cry1Ab nontoxic mutants located in the exposed loop 2 of domain II or in beta-16 of domain III were affected in binding to APN and ALP, depending on their oligomeric state. In particular monomers of the nontoxic domain III, the L511A mutant did not bind ALP but retained APN binding, suggesting that initial interaction with ALP is critical for toxicity. Our data suggest that APN and ALP fulfill two roles. First APN and ALP are initial receptors promoting the localization of toxin monomers in the midgut microvilli before interaction with cadherin. Then APN and ALP function as secondary receptors mediating oligomer insertion into the membrane. However, the expression pattern of these receptors and the phenotype of L511A mutant suggest that ALP may have a predominant role in toxin action because Cry toxins are highly effective against the neonate larvae that is the target for pest control programs."

In S. elongatus, three neighboring genes, kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC, encode proteins of the central oscillator. Inactivation of any of them abolishes the clock, as does overexpression of KaiA or KaiC (Ishiura et al., 1998Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H.

The oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation in a mixture of the three Kai proteins and ATP in vitro (Nakajima et al., 2005Nakajima M. Imai K. Ito H. Nishiwaki T. Murayama Y. Iwasaki H. Oyama T. Kondo T. Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro.Science. 2005; 308: 414-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) suggests that the phosphorylation cycle is the fundamental timekeeping mechanism in cyanobacteria. However, the ATPase activity of KaiC also oscillates in a circadian manner, is intrinsically temperature compensated, and determines circadian period length, suggestive of a timekeeping role that may be separable from the phosphorylation cycle (Terauchi et al., 2007Terauchi K. Kitayama Y. Nishiwaki T. Miwa K. Murayama Y. Oyama T. Kondo T. ATPase activity of KaiC determines the basic timing for circadian clock of cyanobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 16377-16381Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A gene expression rhythm persists in the absence of a KaiC phosphorylation rhythm (Kitayama et al., 2008Kitayama Y. Nishiwaki T. Terauchi K. Kondo T. Dual KaiC-based oscillations constitute the circadian system of cyanobacteria.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); thus, other aspects of KaiC, such as the ATPase activity, may underlie the basic timing mechanism instead of, or in addition to, KaiC phosphorylation. Temporal information from the cyanobacterial oscillator is broadcast to downstream genes via the histidine protein kinase SasA, whose autophosphorylation is stimulated by interaction with KaiC (Iwasaki et al., 2000Iwasaki H.

An input pathway that includes CikA, LdpA, and Pex relays environmental information to the oscillator for synchronization (Dong and Golden, 2008Dong G. Golden S.S. How a cyanobacterium tells time.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Both CikA and LdpA sense light indirectly through cofactors that perceive changes in the cellular redox state, which varies with photosynthetic activity (Ivleva et al., 2005Ivleva N.B. Bramlett M.R.

USA. 2006; 103: 17468-17473Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CikA is found in a complex with LdpA, KaiA, KaiC, and SasA in vivo, but no direct biochemical interaction has been detected between CikA and the oscillator. A cikA null mutant exhibits short-period, low-amplitude gene expression rhythms and fails to reset the phases of rhythms after an environmental cue (Schmitz et al., 2000Schmitz O. Katayama M. Williams S.B. Kondo T. Golden S.S. CikA, a bacteriophytochrome that resets the cyanobacterial circadian clock.Science. 2000; 289: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar); additionally, it is defective in cell division, resulting in elongated cells (Miyagishima et al., 2005Miyagishima S.Y. Wolk C.P. Osteryoung K.W. Identification of cyanobacterial cell division genes by comparative and mutational analyses.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 126-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cell division is a cyclic event that is tightly regulated by and coordinated with other cellular activities. Few studies to date have focused on the interaction between the cell and circadian cycles, with even fewer molecular details. For example, in regenerating liver cells of mice, circadian clock proteins directly control the expression of Wee1, a kinase that inhibits the entry into mitosis (Matsuo et al., 2003Matsuo T. Yamaguchi S. Mitsui S. Emi A. Shimoda F. Okamura H. Control mechanism of the circadian clock for timing of cell division in vivo.Science. 2003; 302: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Cell division is also gated by the clock in mouse fibroblast cells cultured in vitro (Nagoshi et al., 2004Nagoshi E. Saini C. Bauer C. Laroche T. Naef F. Schibler U. Circadian gene expression in individual fibroblasts: Cell-autonomous and self-sustained oscillators pass time to daughter cells.Cell. 2004; 119: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) and in S. elongatus (Mori et al., 1996Mori T. Binder B. Johnson C.H. Circadian gating of cell division in cyanobacteria growing with average doubling times of less than 24 hours.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The rate of DNA synthesis is constant in the cyanobacterium and not phase dependent, suggestive of regulation further downstream—such as cytokinesis (Mori et al., 1996Mori T. Binder B. Johnson C.H. Circadian gating of cell division in cyanobacteria growing with average doubling times of less than 24 hours.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The mechanism of cell division gating in S. elongatus has remained unknown in the face of rich molecular details of the cyanobacterial circadian clock. Elucidation of this pathway would tie the oscillator to a key fitness component of cell physiology. Here, we show that elevated ATPase activity of KaiC closes the cell division gate and demonstrate a linear signal transduction pathway from the input components to the central oscillator and to the output pathway in the regulation of cell division. We also show that localization of the bacterial tubulin homolog FtsZ is a target of clock control. This work revealed the surprising action of a KaiA-independent, but CikA-suppressed, activity that stimulates KaiC autophosphorylation. A model of the relationship of KaiC ATPase and phosphorylation activities, and how they are incorporated with the input and output pathways of the clock, emerges from this work. A previous report showed the gating of cell division in a population of S. elongatus cells measured over several circadian cycles (Mori et al., 1996Mori T. Binder B. Johnson C.H. Circadian gating of cell division in cyanobacteria growing with average doubling times of less than 24 hours.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). That work predated the identification of molecular components of the cyanobacterial clock and did not address the process in individual cells. CikA is the only clock component that has been reported to play a role in cell division (Miyagishima et al., 2005Miyagishima S.Y. Wolk C.P. Osteryoung K.W. Identification of cyanobacterial cell division genes by comparative and mutational analyses.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 126-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); therefore, we tested the requirement of cikA for the gating of cell division. Using timelapse microscopy, we directly monitored growing cells for 3 days, recording events of cell division and the circadian rhythm of kaiBC promoter activity as reported by a destabilized yellow fluorescent protein, YFP-SsrA(LVA) (Chabot et al., 2007Chabot J.R. Pedraza J.M. Luitel P. van Oudenaarden A. Stochastic gene expression out-of-steady-state in the cyanobacterial circadian clock.Nature. 2007; 450: 1249-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Individual cikA mutant cells show rhythmic gene expression, with a period of 22.0 ± 1.1 hr, whereas the wild-type (WT) cells oscillate with a period of 24.9 ± 1.0 hr (Figure 1A ), consistent with results from luciferase reporters (Schmitz et al., 2000Schmitz O. Katayama M. Williams S.B. Kondo T. Golden S.S. CikA, a bacteriophytochrome that resets the cyanobacterial circadian clock.Science. 2000; 289: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To address whether and how the circadian clock gates cell division, all division events were assigned to their corresponding circadian phases, normalized into one circadian period 0 ∼ 2 π, and plotted as a histogram. To avoid sampling bias, we ensured that the initial circadian phases were evenly distributed; i.e., the cells examined are unsynchronized (data not shown). The occurrence of cell division in the WT is apparently suppressed around the peak of fluorescence (Figure 1B), indicating that cell division is gated. In the cikA mutant, a similar dip in the histogram was seen, although the overall occurrences of cell division during this window are higher and the duration of the inhibition is longer. As a control we monitored cell division in an arrhythmic kaiC null mutant. Thus, the division events cannot be assigned to specific circadian phases. However, when we plotted the distribution of doubling time of all cells monitored (Figure 1C), the kaiC mutant had only a single peak in contrast to two peaks in the WT and cikA mutant. We reasoned that when gating is active, the doubling time of cells whose life spans cover the window of gating is prolonged compared to those whose life spans do not, resulting in two populations of cells with distinct doubling times. On the other hand, the doubling time of arrhythmic mutants follows a Gaussian distribution pattern in the absence of a gate. Both of these complementary types of analysis are able to detect gating of cell division. In conclusion, cikA is not essential to the gating of cell division, although its absence causes elongated cells and affects characteristics of the gate. The phenotypic effects of a cikA null mutation on both circadian rhythms and cell length could be due to CikA's involvement in two pathways that separately govern circadian rhythms and cell division; alternatively, CikA may affect a clock pathway that regulates the gating of the cell cycle. If the second hypothesis is true, mutation of some clock genes would suppress the cikA null cell elongation phenotype. We made double mutants of cikA and central oscillator genes. Cell lengths of various mutants, grown under the same conditions simultaneously to minimize variations caused by cell density and/or light intensity (Figure S1 available online), were measured and compared. As expected, cikA mutant cells are significantly longer than the WT (Figures 1D and 1E). In the ΔkaiCΔcikA mutant, however, the absence of KaiC suppresses the cell division defect of cikA. The ΔkaiAΔcikA and ΔkaiBΔcikA mutants are still elongated. These data suggest that cikA regulates cell division through the clock, and that KaiC lies downstream of CikA in this pathway. To address the roles of other clock genes in cell-cycle control, single mutants were examined. Cells of a kaiB mutant average almost twice as long as WT, whereas mutants of kaiA, kaiC, or ldpA have normal cell lengths (Figures 1D and 1E and data not shown). The extensive evidence of KaiB-KaiC interaction suggested that inactivation of kaiC would also suppress the kaiB phenotype. Indeed, the cell length of a kaiBC double mutant is like WT (Figures 1D and 1E). We propose that the role of KaiB in determining cell length is the same as its function in modifying KaiC phosphorylation state. KaiB is known to inactivate KaiA to initiate KaiC dephosphorylation (Rust et al., 2007Rust M.J. Markson J.S. Lane W.S. Fisher D.S. O'Shea E.K. Ordered phosphorylation governs oscillation of a three-protein circadian clock.Science. 2007; 318: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Loss of kaiB abolishes circadian rhythms (Ishiura et al., 1998Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Expression of a gene cluster kaiABC as a circadian feedback process in cyanobacteria.Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and results in constitutively phosphorylated KaiC both in vivo (Figure 2C ) and in vitro (Iwasaki et al., 2002Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. KaiA-stimulated KaiC phosphorylation in circadian timing loops in cyanobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, Kitayama et al., 2003Kitayama Y. Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kondo T. KaiB functions as an attenuator of KaiC phosphorylation in the cyanobacterial circadian clock system.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2127-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). CikA also affects KaiC phosphorylation state (Ivleva et al., 2006Ivleva N.B. Gao T. LiWang A.C. Golden S.S. Quinone sensing by the circadian input kinase of the cyanobacterial circadian clock.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17468-17473Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether constitutively phosphorylated KaiC is the cause of cell division inhibition. To stimulate KaiC phosphorylation, we overexpressed KaiA from an IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside)-inducible trc promoter in a WT background, which abolishes circadian rhythms of gene expression and KaiC phosphorylation (Ishiura et al., 1998Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T.

Nishiwaki T. Terauchi K. Kondo T. Dual KaiC-based oscillations constitute the circadian system of cyanobacteria.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and in a kaiC null background in parallel. Cells overexpressing KaiA in the presence of KaiC are significantly longer than those in the kaiC null background and in WT cells after IPTG addition, whereas no difference was observed before induction (Figures 2A and 2B). Note that, during the 5 day induction period, WT cells also lengthened, which is due to higher cell density and/or lower light penetration and not related to IPTG (Figure S1). Interestingly, the cikA mutant's cell length is much more affected by culture density than the WT (Figure S1A). We confirmed that KaiC becomes and stays highly phosphorylated after IPTG induction (Figure 2C and data not shown). We further demonstrated that the cell elongation phenotype is reversible by removing IPTG after days of KaiA-YFP overexpression (Figure S2).Figure S2Cell Elongation Caused by KaiA-YFP Overexpression Is Reversible; No Rhythms of Gene Expression or Phosphorylation Are Present in the ΔcikAΔkaiA Mutant, Related to Figure 2Show full captionIf constitutive phosphorylation of KaiC is the cause of cell elongation, overexpression of KaiA would block cell division and the return of KaiA to preinduction levels would then unlock KaiC from its hyperphosphorylated state and initiate new rounds of cell division. To test this hypothesis, we fused KaiA to YFP genetically and expressed it from the trc promoter in the WT background. The KaiA-YFP fusion protein is fully functional, complements a kaiA null mutant when expressed without IPTG, and stimulates constitutive KaiC phosphorylation with the addition of IPTG (data not shown). This fusion allows us to monitor the relative expression level of KaiA-YFP and cell length at the same time using timelapse microscopy. We induced expression with 1 mM IPTG for 7 days, washed off IPTG, and started monitoring a group of cells continuously.(A) Snapshots of cells at 8 different time points after IPTG washoff.

The 10 hr lag between basal KaiA-YFP level and cell division is likely due to the slow process of KaiC de-phosphorylation (Rust et al., 2007Rust M.J. Markson J.S. Lane W.S. Fisher D.S. O'Shea E.K.

KaiC in the ΔcikAΔkaiA mutant remains 60% phosphorylated during our sampling period. Recently, several KaiC variants were created that are constitutively hyper- or hypophosphorylated independent of KaiA or KaiB (Kim et al., 2008Kim Y.I. Dong G. Carruthers Jr., C.W. Golden S.S.

KaiC487, a truncation mutant missing the last 32 aa, and the missense mutant KaiCE444D are both highly phosphorylated, whereas KaiC497 remains unphosphorylated. We expressed these alleles in a kaiC null mutant and, consistent with the hypothesis that phosphorylated KaiC is an inhibitor of cell division, both KaiC487 and KaiCE444D caused cell elongation whereas KaiC497 did not (Figures 2D and 2E). Cells of the ΔkaiAΔcikA mutant are elongated (Figures 1D and 1E), which was intriguing because all evidence had suggested that phosphorylated KaiC inhibits cell division, yet KaiA is required for KaiC phosphorylation. We examined the KaiC phosphorylation state in this strain and found it ∼60% phosphorylated, in contrast to being fully unphosphorylated in the ΔkaiA strain (Figure 2C). No oscillation in gene expression or KaiC phosphorylation is observed in the ΔkaiAΔcikA mutant (Figure S2). We concluded that an unknown activity is able to stimulate KaiC phosphorylation independently of KaiA, and that this cryptic activity is inhibited by CikA. Furthermore, KaiC does not need to be fully phosphorylated to inhibit cell division. Either the absolute amount of phosphorylated KaiC is sufficient, or some state of KaiC other than phosphorylation is the underlying mechanism. KaiC phosphorylation is a dynamic process and four forms of KaiC cycle in a"

https://openalex.org/W1969624372,"Activation of Ca(2+) signaling induced by receptor stimulation and mechanical stress plays a critical role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. A canonical transient receptor potential protein subfamily member, TRPC6, which is activated by diacylglycerol and mechanical stretch, works as an upstream regulator of the Ca(2+) signaling pathway. Although activation of protein kinase G (PKG) inhibits TRPC6 channel activity and cardiac hypertrophy, respectively, it is unclear whether PKG suppresses cardiac hypertrophy through inhibition of TRPC6. Here, we show that inhibition of cGMP-selective PDE5 (phosphodiesterase 5) suppresses endothelin-1-, diacylglycerol analog-, and mechanical stretch-induced hypertrophy through inhibition of Ca(2+) influx in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of PDE5 suppressed the increase in frequency of Ca(2+) spikes induced by agonists or mechanical stretch. However, PDE5 inhibition did not suppress the hypertrophic responses induced by high KCl or the activation of protein kinase C, suggesting that PDE5 inhibition suppresses Ca(2+) influx itself or molecule(s) upstream of Ca(2+) influx. PKG activated by PDE5 inhibition phosphorylated TRPC6 proteins at Thr(69) and prevented TRPC6-mediated Ca(2+) influx. Substitution of Ala for Thr(69) in TRPC6 abolished the anti-hypertrophic effects of PDE5 inhibition. In addition, chronic PDE5 inhibition by oral sildenafil treatment actually induced TRPC6 phosphorylation in mouse hearts. Knockdown of RGS2 (regulator of G protein signaling 2) and RGS4, both of which are activated by PKG to reduce G alpha(q)-mediated signaling, did not affect the suppression of receptor-activated Ca(2+) influx by PDE5 inhibition. These results suggest that phosphorylation and functional suppression of TRPC6 underlie prevention of pathological hypertrophy by PDE5 inhibition."

Núñez G. Immunity. 2007; 27: 549-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 13Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar). The bipartite adaptor protein ASC bridges the interaction between Nlrp3 and caspase-1 by means of homotypic interactions involving its pyrin and CARD motifs, making it essential for activation of the inflammasome. However, the role of the inflammasome components Nlrp3, ASC, and caspase-1 in CIA has not been addressed. The goal of the present study was to understand the roles of Nlrp3, ASC, and caspase-1 in CIA. We found that ASC knock-out mice were protected from arthritis, whereas disease incidence and severity in Nlrp3−/− and caspase-1−/− mice was normal. Unlike Nlrp3−/− and caspase-1−/− mice, the production of CII-specific antibodies in the serum of immunized ASC−/− mice was abolished. In addition, antigen-specific proliferation and production of T cell cytokines by ASC−/− lymph node cells was significantly reduced, whereas antigen-independent T cell activation was unaffected. Incubation of ASC−/− T cells with wild type, but not ASC−/− dendritic cells (DCs), restored antigen-induced proliferation, hence confirming that ASC expression in dendritic cells is required for T cell priming. Therefore, ASC fulfills a caspase-1- (and thus inflammasome)-independent role in T cell priming in dendritic cells that is crucial for induction of antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity and the onset of collagen-induced arthritis. Nlrp3−/−, ASC−/−, and Casp1−/− mice backcrossed to C57BL/6 background for at least 10 generations have been described before (14Kanneganti T.D. Ozören N. Body-Malapel M. Amer A. Park J.H. Franchi L.

Mice were housed in a pathogen-free facility, and the animal studies were conducted under protocols approved by the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Committee on Use and Care of Animals. CII was prepared according to the methods of Miller et al. (16Miller E.J. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) dissolved in 10 mm acetic acid (4 mg/ml overnight at 4 °C) and emulsified in an equal volume of CFA containing 4 mg/ml heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37 Ra, Difco). Arthritis was induced as described previously (17Brand D.D. Latham K.A. Rosloniec E.F. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) with a single intradermal injection of 200 mg CII/100 ml emulsion. The severity of the arthritis was assessed using a visual scoring system. Each paw was scored on a graded scale from 0 to 3: 0, normal paw; 1, swelling and/or redness of one toe or finger joint; 2, swelling of two or more toes or joints, or increased swelling; and 3, severe swelling and/or ankylosis throughout the entire paw. Each paw was graded, and the four scores were added such that the maximal score per mouse was 12. The clinical score was determined daily for each mouse for up to 42 days. Hind limbs were fixed for 24 h in 10% neutral buffered formalin and decalcified in TBD-2. Knee joints were processed by routine methods to paraffin blocks. Specimens were sectioned at 6 mm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Safranin-O staining was performed to evaluate cartilage integrity. The stifle joint sections were evaluated for disease severity using a scoring system from 0 to 4: 0, within normal limits; 1, minimal; 2, mild; 3, moderate; and 4, severe. Evaluation and scoring was performed by an experienced veterinary pathologist. Micro-CT micrographs of paws fixed in formalin were made using an ex vivo micro-CT scanner (LocusSP Specimen CT, GE Healthcare) at 28-μm isotropic voxel size, with 720 projections, an integration time of 1,700 msec, photon energy of 80 keV, and a current of 70 μA. IgG antibody levels against the immunogen were measured by standard ELISA methodology. In brief, 96-well serocluster U-vinyl plates (Costar) were coated with 100 μl of CII (5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. The wells were blocked with 200 μl of PBS/Tween 20 containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (1 h at 4 °C). 2-Fold serial dilutions (beginning at 1/100 dilution) of mouse sera in PBS supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 2% normal goat serum (PelFreeze) were applied and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse isotype-specific IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c, IgG3, or IgM antisera (Southern Biotechnology) were applied for 2 h at 4 °C, and conversion of the substrate (o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, Sigma) was determined using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad model 450). Popliteal lymph nodes were collected 10 days after immunization with 20 μl of CFA emulsion containing 10 μg of either CII or ovalbumin (Sigma). CD4+ T cells were isolated by negative selection using a mouse CD4+ T cell enrichment strategy (Miltenyi AutoMACS). CD4+/CD11c+ dendritic cells were isolated from collagenase-D-treated (Roche) spleens of naïve ASC−/− and ASC+/+ mice according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures consisted of with 5 × 105 of the indicated type of CD4 T cells/well and 2.5 × 105 of the indicated type of dendritic cells/well and the indicated concentration of antigen. Cultures were maintained in U-bottom plates in 300 μl of HL-1 medium (Lonza) supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin G and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 292 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 72 h. Supernatants were harvested for evaluation of cytokine production (below), and cultures were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well in 10 μl), incubated for an additional 18 h, harvested onto Unifilter GF/C plates, and counted (counts/min on a TopCount NXT (PerkinElmer). Bone marrow-derived dendritic cell cultures were prepared as described (18Lamkanfi M. Malireddi R.K. Kanneganti T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20574-20581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli, serotype 0111:B4, Sigma) or heat-killed Mycobacterium (1 μg/ml) or PBS for 24 h. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cell cultures were resuspended into PBS/2% fetal bovine serum, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD11c monoclonal antibody, PE-conjugated anti-MHC class II monoclonal antibody and APC-conjugated anti-CD86 on ice for 30 min, washed twice with PBS/2% fetal bovine serum, and fixed in PBS/2% paraformaldehyde. Labeled cells were assayed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software. IL-2, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, and IFN-γ were determined using a mouse Bio-Plex ELISA kit (Bio-Rad). Data are represented as the mean ± S.E. Clinical and histopathological scores and serum anti-CII antibody levels were analyzed with Student's t test. Incidence of mice that developed disease was analyzed with Fisher's exact test. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. To determine the functional roles of Nlrp3, ASC, and Casp1 in the development and progression of CIA, arthritic symptoms in age- and sex-matched wild type and gene-deficient mice lacking Nlrp3, ASC, or caspase-1 were studied following immunization with CII on day 0. Mice were examined daily for signs of developing arthritis. The severity of arthritis was assessed using a visual scoring system. The clinical scores and the arthritis incidence in Nlrp3−/− and caspase-1−/− were comparable with those of wild type mice (Fig. 1, A and B). By day 42, 70–80% of the immunized wild type, Nlrp3−/−, and caspase-1−/− mice had a clinical score >3. Remarkably, all mice in the ASC knock-out cohort were resistant to CIA, with none of the mice in this cohort displaying any clinical signs of arthritis at day 42 (Fig. 1, A and B). Indeed, the hind paws of most wild type, Nlrp3−/−, and Casp1−/− mice were significantly swollen and presented with ankylosis at day 34, whereas the hind paws of all immunized ASC knock-out mice had a normal appearance (Fig. 1C). To validate these clinical assessments, the extent of bone and cartilage erosion in hind paws of representative wild type, Nlrp3−/−, ASC−/−, and Casp1−/− mice was assessed by three-dimensional micro-CT imaging. Hind paws of immunized WT, Nlrp3−/−, and Casp1−/− mice exhibited severe cortical bone erosion in the metatarsal region (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, hind paws of CII-immunized ASC−/− mice appeared similar to those of naïve mice (Fig. 2, A and B) and displayed no apparent bone erosion (Fig. 2, A and B). To compare the extent of bone destruction, we quantified the mineral density of the five hind paw digits of CII-immunized mice of each genotype. In line with the micro-CT images, digits of immunized ASC knock-out mice were significantly more dense than those of wild type, Nlrp3−/−, and Casp1−/− mice (Fig. 2C). The micro-CT studies were subsequently complemented with histological examination of representative stifle joints. Unlike ASC−/− mice, hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of the stifle joints of wild type, Nlrp3−/−, and Casp1−/− mice showed substantial levels of infiltrated inflammatory cells, thickening of the lining layer and chondrocyte cell death (Fig. 3A). Significant cartilage and subchondral bone erosion and depletion of matrix proteoglycan was apparent on safranin O-stained tissue sections of each genotype, except ASC−/− mice as evidenced by the deep pink color of the cartilage (Fig. 3B). Semiquantitative scoring of these histological parameters confirmed that arthritic severity in Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− was comparable with those of wild type mice, whereas ASC−/− mice were strongly protected from CIA histopathology (Fig. 3C). Together, these results demonstrate that ASC is required for the development of CIA independently of its role in caspase-1 activation in the inflammasome. Both T cell-mediated and humoral immune responses have been demonstrated to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of CIA (–3Haqqi T.M. David C.S. J.

To gain some insight into the mechanism by which ASC mediates CIA, we first determined the serum levels of CII-specific antibodies in immunized mice at day 42 post-immunization. Circulating levels of CII-specific IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgG3 antibodies were comparably elevated in the serum of wild type, Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− mice (Fig. 4, A–D). Moreover, the serum of immunized ASC−/− mice was devoid of CII-specific IgM antibodies (Fig. 4E), indicating that ASC functions upstream of antibody class switch recombination. In agreement with these findings, the majority of WT, Nlrp3−/−, and Casp1−/− mice presented with significantly enlarged popliteal lymph nodes, whereas none of the immunized ASC−/− mice had clearly visible popliteal lymph nodes (Fig. 5A). Concurrently, popliteal lymph nodes of ASC knock-out mice were nearly devoid of immune cells, whereas those of immunized wild type, Nlrp3−/−, and Casp1−/− mice contained several million cells per lymph node (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrate that unlike wild type, Nlrp3−/−, and Casp1−/− mice, animals lacking ASC are incapable of mounting a humoral immune response to CII.FIGURE 5ASC knock-out mice are protected from CII-induced popliteal lymph node enlargement.

We therefore investigated whether the lack of anti-CII antibodies in immunized ASC−/− mice was due to a defective T cell response to CII. In vitro proliferation of lymph node cells from ASC−/− mice in the presence of CII was significantly impaired relative to those of ASC+/+ mice (Fig. 6A). The defective antigen-specific proliferation of ASC−/− T cells is not limited to CII as the immunizing antigen because ASC−/− lymph node cells also failed to proliferate in the presence of tuberculin-purified protein derivative (Fig. 6B) and ovalbumin (Fig. 6C). In agreement with the defective antigen-specific proliferation of lymph node cells from ASC−/− mice immunized with ovalbumin in CFA (Fig. 6C), the supernatant of ovalbumin-restimulated ASC−/− lymph node cells contained significantly reduced levels of the TH1 cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2 (Fig. 6, D and E), the TH2 cytokines IL-10 and IL-13 (Fig. 6, F and G) and the TH17 cytokine IL-17 (Fig. 6H). Unlike ASC-deficient lymphocytes, lymph node cells from Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− mice that were immunized with ovalbumin in CFA mounted a potent dose-dependent proliferation in response to ovalbumin (supplemental Fig. 1). The role of ASC in antigen-induced humoral and T cell responses is not strictly associated with the TH1 adjuvant CFA because ASC knock-out mice immunized with ovalbumin in the TH2 adjuvant alum (adjuvant containing hydrated aluminum potassium sulfate) also failed to produce ovalbumin-specific antibodies and the TH2-associated cytokine IL-5 (supplemental Fig. 2). Moreover, the inhibition of proliferation in ASC−/− immune cells is antigen-specific because direct T cell receptor ligation with CD3 and CD28 antibodies induced a potent proliferation of ASC−/− CD4+ and CD8+ (supplemental Fig. 3) T cells. These results show that ASC-deficient T cells appear intrinsically normal and suggest that ASC fulfills an inflammatory role in antigen presentation in dendritic cells. Moreover, similar to the inflammasome-independent role of ASC in the induction of CIA, the ASC-dependent induction of antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation does not require Nlrp3 or Casp1. To test the hypothesis that antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation requires ASC expression in dendritic cells, ovalbumin-induced proliferation of purified ASC+/+ or ASC−/− T cells was measured following incubation with isolated ASC+/+ or ASC−/− dendritic cells. Our results show that wild type T cells incubated with wild type dendritic cells mounted a significant proliferative response to ovalbumin (Fig. 7A). ASC−/− T cells co-cultured with wild type dendritic cells displayed a proliferative response comparable with that of wild type T cells incubated with wild type dendritic cells (Fig. 7A), demonstrating that ASC−/− T cells can mount a normal ovalbumin-induced proliferative response in the presence of wild type dendritic cells. In contrast, both wild type and ASC−/− T cells co-cultured with ASC−/− dendritic cells exhibited a substantially reduced ovalbumin-induced proliferation (Fig. 7A). We also analyzed the expression of dendritic cell activation markers to ensure that ASC deficiency did not cause a general defect in dendritic cell responsiveness. In line with a specific role for ASC in T cell priming, cell surface expression of MHCII and CD86 were similarly induced in LPS-treated wild type and ASC-deficient dendritic cells relative to PBS-treated controls (supplemental Fig. 4). Cell surface expression of MHCII and CD86 was also comparably induced in ASC−/− and wild type dendritic cells stimulated with heat-killed M. tuberculosis (supplemental Fig. 5), an immunostimulating component of CFA. In contrast to ASC−/− dendritic cells, the absence of the inflammasome components Nlrp3 (Fig. 7B) and Casp1 (Fig. 7C) in dendritic cells did not affect ovalbumin-induced T cell proliferation. These results demonstrate that ASC expression in dendritic cells is required for antigen-induced T cell priming independently of caspase-1 inflammasomes. Moreover, the impaired antigen presentation by ASC−/− dendritic cells, but not Nlrp3−/− or Casp1−/− dendritic cells, correlates strongly with the defects in antigen-induced adaptive immunity and the marked resistance against collagen-induced arthritis observed in ASC−/− mice, but not Nlrp3−/− or Casp1−/− mice. These data demonstrate that ASC fulfills a caspase-1 inflammasome-independent role in T cell priming in dendritic cells that is crucial for induction of antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity and the onset of collagen-induced arthritis. The murine model of CIA has been extensively used to increase our understanding of autoimmune-mediated arthritis and identify potential new therapeutic agents to treat rheumatoid arthritis in humans (19Holmdahl R. Malmström V. Vuorio E. Ann. Med. 1993; 25: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This study is the first to demonstrate the critical role of ASC as a key player in the pathogenesis of CIA. ASC-deficient mice were dramatically protected from the incidence and severity of disease in CIA. The absence of clinical symptoms of arthritis was confirmed by the absence of bone destruction in micro-CT scans and by histopathological evaluation. In marked contrast to ASC knock-out mice, clinical and histological evaluation of type II collagen-immunized Casp1−/− and Nlrp3−/− mice showed a normal progression of disease parameters, indicating that the role of ASC in CIA is independent from the caspase-1 inflammasome. Our observation that caspase-1-deficient mice are susceptible to CIA may appear as a contradiction to a previous report demonstrating that the chemical Casp1 inhibitor VX-765 provided protection against CIA (20Wannamaker W. Davies R. Namchuk M. Pollard J. Ford P. Ku G. Decker C. Charifson P. Weber P. Germann U.A. Kuida K. Randle J.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 321: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that VX-765 is also an effective inhibitor of other inflammatory caspases. For instance, its Ki for caspase-4 (<0.6 nm) is slightly better than the Ki for Casp1 (0.8 nm) (20Wannamaker W. Davies R. Namchuk M. Pollard J. Ford P. Ku G. Decker C. Charifson P. Weber P. Germann U.A. Kuida K. Randle J.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 321: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This suggests that the protection against CIA observed with VX-765 may be due to inhibition of inflammatory caspases other than caspase-1. Noteworthy in this regard is the fact that caspase-1-deficient mice very recently also have been shown to be susceptible to antigen-induced arthritis, whereas ASC knock-out mice were highly resistant (21Kolly L. Karababa M. Joosten L.A. Narayan S. Salvi R. Pétrilli V. Tschopp J. van den Berg W.B. So A.K. Busso N. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, one may not conclude from the observation that Casp1−/− mice are sensitive to CIA and antigen-induced arthritis and that there is no role for IL-1β and IL-18 in arthritis. Indeed, several additional proteases including caspase-8 (22Maelfait J. Vercammen E. Janssens S. Schotte P. Haegman M. Magez S. Beyaert R. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), proteinase-3 (23Coeshott C. Ohnemus C. Pilyavskaya A. Ross S. Wieczorek M. Kroona H. Leimer A.H. Cheronis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 6261-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and granzymes (24Irmler M. Hertig S. MacDonald H.R. Sadoul R. Becherer J.D. Proudfoot A. Solari R. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1917-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) have been shown to process IL-1β and IL-18 into biologically active cytokines. Moreover, several of these proteases have been implicated in CIA (25Adkison A.M. Raptis S.Z. Kelley D.G. Pham C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Thus, IL-1β and IL-18 production through one (or several) of these proteases may contribute to CIA and antigen-induced arthritis. To study the mechanism by which ASC controls CIA induction, we started from the knowledge that the pathogenesis of CIA is dependent on both humoral and cellular immunity against CII (4Holmdahl R. Andersson M. Goldschmidt T.J. Gustafsson K. Jansson L. Mo J.A. Immunol. Rev. 1990; 118: 193-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The amount of anti-collagen type II antibodies of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgM subtypes were all significantly reduced in ASC knock-out mice. Consistent with an inflammasome-independent role for ASC in CIA onset and progression, the levels of anti-CII-antibodies in the serum of Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− mice did not differ significantly from those of immunized wild type mice. Dendritic cells are the most potent antigen-presenting cells capable of stimulating naïve T cells for the induction of T cell and B cell responses. Indeed, we found that antigen-specific activation of ASC-deficient T cells by ASC knock-out dendritic cells was significantly hampered. In contrast, the antigen-specific proliferation of ASC-deficient T cells following incubation with wild type dendritic cells was normal. This suggests that the underlying cause for the absence of CII-induced T cell and B cell responses during CIA in ASC knock-out mice was mainly due to impaired T cell priming by ASC-deficient dendritic cells. In line with this notion, direct ligation of the T cell receptor of ASC knock-out T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies triggered a potent T cell proliferation comparable with that of wild type T cells. The role of ASC in T cell priming by dendritic cells is inflammasome-independent because Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− dendritic cells did not display this defect in T cell priming. Moreover, the role of ASC in dendritic cells is specifically associated with T cell priming because the LPS- and heat-killed Mycobacterium-induced induction of the cell surface activation markers MHCII and CD86 was not affected in ASC−/− dendritic cells. An inflammasome-independent role for ASC in lymphocytes during bovine serum albumin-induced arthritis was recently reported (21Kolly L. Karababa M. Joosten L.A. Narayan S. Salvi R. Pétrilli V. Tschopp J. van den Berg W.B. So A.K. Busso N. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the latter and our work are largely in agreement, we showed that ASC is required in dendritic cells for antigen-induced T cell priming. A possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy may lie in the fact that ASC may have roles in both dendritic cells and lymphocytes. Thus, depending on the experimental arthritis model under study, its role in either myeloid or lymphoid cells may prevail. On a molecular level, several mechanisms by which ASC controls antigen presentation in dendritic cells can be envisaged and require further investigation. For instance, ASC may mediate antigen processing, intracellular trafficking, and/or antigen loading onto MHC receptors in dendritic cells. Alternatively, ASC may be required for the production of co-stimulatory factors. Regardless, our results establish a novel role of ASC in the induction of adaptive immune responses independently of caspase-1 inflammasomes and suggest a crucial role for ASC in arthritis and other autoimmune diseases apart from the inflammasome.

https://openalex.org/W2093908005,"CD39 is a transmembrane enzyme that inhibits platelet reactivity and inflammation by phosphohydrolyzing ATP and ADP to AMP. Cyclic AMP (cAMP), an essential second messenger, is particularly important in regulating genes controlling vascular homeostasis. These experiments test the hypothesis that cAMP might positively regulate the expression of CD39 and thereby modulate important vascular homeostatic properties. Cd39 mRNA was induced by 13.8- fold in RAW cells treated with a membrane-permeant cAMP analogue (8-bromo-cyclic AMP; 8-Br-cAMP), stimulation of adenylate cyclase, or prostanoids known to drive cAMP response. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting, immunofluorescence, and TLC assays demonstrated that both CD39 protein expression and enzymatic activity were increased in cells treated with 8-Br-cAMP but not in cells transfected with short hairpin RNA against CD39. This analogue drove a significant increase in transcriptional activity at the Cd39 promoter although not when the promoter's cAMP-response element sites were mutated. Pretreatment with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), or ERK inhibitors nearly obliterated the cAMP-driven increase in Cd39 mRNA, protein expression, and promoter activity. 8-Br-cAMP greatly increased the phosphorylation of CREB1 (Ser(133)) and ATF2 (Thr(71)) in a PKA-, PI3K-, and ERK-dependent fashion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that binding of phosphorylated CREB1 and ATF2 to cAMP-response element-like sites was significantly increased with 8-Br-cAMP treatment and that binding was reduced with PKA, PI3K, and ERK inhibition, whereas transfection of Creb1 and Atf2 overexpression constructs enhanced cAMP-driven Cd39 mRNA expression. Transfection of RAW cells with mutated Creb1 (S133A) reduced cAMP-driven Cd39 mRNA expression. Furthermore, the cAMP-mediated induction of Cd39 mRNA, protein, and phosphohydrolytic activity was replicated in primary peritoneal macrophages. These data identify cAMP as a crucial regulator of macrophage CD39 expression and demonstrate that cAMP acts through the PKA/CREB, PKA/PI3K/ATF2, and PKA/ERK/ATF2 pathways to control a key vascular homeostatic mediator."
https://openalex.org/W2029715362,"Prevalence and mortality make cancer a health challenge in need of effective and better tolerated therapeutic approaches, with tumor angiogenesis identified as a promising target for drug development. The epoxygenase products, the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, are pro-angiogenic, and down-regulation of their biosynthesis by peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) ligands reduces tumor angiogenesis and growth. Endothelial cells lacking a Cyp2c44 epoxygenase, a PPARalpha target, show reduced proliferative and tubulogenic activities that are reversed by the enzyme's metabolites. In a mouse xenograft model of tumorigenesis, disruption of the host Cyp2c44 gene causes marked reductions in tumor volume, mass, and vascularization. The relevance of these studies to human cancer is indicated by the demonstration that: (a) activation of human PPARalpha down-regulates endothelial cell CYP2C9 epoxygenase expression and blunts proliferation and tubulogenesis, (b) in a PPARalpha-humanized mouse model, activation of the receptor inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth, and (c) the CYP2C9 epoxygenase is expressed in the vasculature of human tumors. The identification of anti-angiogenic/anti-tumorigenic properties of PPARalpha points to a role for the receptor and its epoxygenase regulatory target in the pathophysiology of cancer, and for its ligands as candidates for the development of a new generation of safer and better tolerated anti-cancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2012027216,"Mycolic acids are key cell wall components for the survival, pathogenicity, and antibiotic resistance of the human tubercle bacillus. Although it was thought that Mycobacterium tuberculosis tightly regulates their production to adapt to prevailing environmental conditions, the molecular mechanisms governing mycolic acid biosynthesis remained extremely obscure. Meromycolic acids, the direct precursors of mycolic acids, are synthesized by a type II fatty acid synthase from acyl carrier protein-bound substrates that are extended iteratively, with a reductive cycle in each round of extension, the second step of which is catalyzed by the essential beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, MabA. In this study, we investigated whether post-translational modifications of MabA might represent a strategy employed by M. tuberculosis to regulate mycolic acid biosynthesis. Indeed, we show here that MabA was efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by several M. tuberculosis Ser/Thr protein kinases, including PknB, as well as in vivo in mycobacteria. Mass spectrometric analyses using LC-ESI/MS/MS and site-directed mutagenesis identified three phosphothreonines, with Thr(191) being the primary phosphor-acceptor. A MabA_T191D mutant, designed to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, exhibited markedly decreased ketoacyl reductase activity compared with the wild-type protein, as well as impaired binding of the NADPH cofactor, as demonstrated by fluorescence spectroscopy. The hypothesis that phosphorylation of Thr(191) alters the enzymatic activity of MabA, and subsequently mycolic acid biosynthesis, was further supported by the fact that constitutive overexpression of the mabA_T191D allele in Mycobacterium bovis BCG strongly impaired mycobacterial growth. Importantly, conditional expression of the phosphomimetic MabA_T191D led to a significant inhibition of de novo biosynthesis of mycolic acids. This study provides the first information on the molecular mechanism(s) involved in mycolic acid regulation through Ser/Thr protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation of a type II fatty acid synthase enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2099647122,"A family of integral membrane proteins containing a signature DHHC motif has been shown to display protein S-acyltransferase activity, modifying cysteine residues in proteins with fatty acids. The physiological roles of these proteins have largely been unexplored. Here we report that mice homozygous for a hypomorphic allele of a previously uncharacterized member, DHHC5, are born at half the expected rate, and survivors show a marked deficit in contextual fear conditioning, an indicator of defective hippocampal-dependent learning. DHHC5 is highly enriched in a post-synaptic density preparation and co-immunoprecipitates with post-synaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), an interaction that is mediated through binding of the carboxyl terminus of DHHC5 and the PDZ3 domain of PSD-95. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that DHHC5 is expressed in the CA3 and dentate gyrus in the hippocampus. These findings point to a previously unsuspected role for DHHC5 in post-synaptic function affecting learning and memory. A family of integral membrane proteins containing a signature DHHC motif has been shown to display protein S-acyltransferase activity, modifying cysteine residues in proteins with fatty acids. The physiological roles of these proteins have largely been unexplored. Here we report that mice homozygous for a hypomorphic allele of a previously uncharacterized member, DHHC5, are born at half the expected rate, and survivors show a marked deficit in contextual fear conditioning, an indicator of defective hippocampal-dependent learning.

These findings point to a previously unsuspected role for DHHC5 in post-synaptic function affecting learning and memory. Palmitoylation of proteins at intracellular sites is mediated by members of a family of S-fatty acyltransferases that are recognized by a DHHC consensus motif at the active site (1Bartels D.J.

Given the large number of family members (22 in human and 23 in mouse) and the daunting number of potential substrates (over 250 in the brain, for example) (21Kang R. Wan J. Arstikaitis P.

Of note, the only previously available DHHC gene knock-out mouse model (the DHHC8 model (22Mukai J. Liu H. Burt R.A. Swor D.E. Lai W.S. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Nat.

In this study we show that a previously uncharacterized DHHC family member, DHHC5, is highly enriched in the brain and in synaptic vesicle fractions and that it interacts with the third PDZ binding domain of PSD-95 in vitro and in vivo. Mice homozygous for a hypomorphic allele of DHHC5 show impaired contextual fear conditioning. DHHC5 is shown to contain a hydroxylamine-sensitive acyl group in vivo, but PSD-95 palmitoylation is unchanged in DHHC5 knock-out mice, suggesting that PSD-95 is not a substrate (which is not surprising, as other DHHC family members have been previously shown to perform this function). We speculate that binding to PSD-95 places DHHC5 in proximity to other important synaptic signaling molecules, where it may regulate post-synaptic events at excitatory synapses important for hippocampal learning. Protein G-agarose beads were obtained from Pierce. FuGENE 6 was obtained from Roche Applied Science. All restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). All other reagents and chemicals were from Sigma. Protein concentrations were determined by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Chicken anti-mouse DHHC5 IgY antibodies were produced (Genetel Laboratories) using a peptide consisting of amino acids 245–261 of mouse DHHC5 (CSSPAPRYLGRPKKEKT) and affinity purified using a peptide column. This antibody was used for immunoblotting following in vitro co-immunoprecipitation assays at a dilution of 10:000. A rabbit anti-mouse DHHC5 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma (catalogue no. HPA014670, distributed in Europe by Atlas Antibodies, Stockholm, Sweden). Immunoblotting with this antibody was performed using a dilution factor of 1:1000. The mouse anti-rat PSD-95 monoclonal antibody (6G6–1C9), the rabbit anti-rat VAMP1 polyclonal antibody, and the rabbit anti-rat calnexin polyclonal antibody were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). A rabbit anti-rat PSD-95 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Synaptic Systems (Goettingen, Germany). The rabbit anti-human GPRIN1 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Proteintech Group (Chicago, IL). The Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody was obtained from Invitrogen.

The anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10), the anti-Myc rabbit polyclonal antibody, the normal mouse IgG control, the anti-rat GAP43 monoclonal antibody, and the anti-bovine COXIV monoclonal antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A full-length mouse DHHC5 cDNA clone was obtained from Open Biosystems (catalogue number MMM1013-65887); the sequence corresponds to the mouse DHHC5 cDNA in GenBankTM BC_020051. For yeast two-hybrid screening, sequences corresponding to the amino acids 220–715 (the carboxyl-terminal cytosolic domain) were cloned into the pLexN vector (Invitrogen) using EcoRI and BamHI sites. Full-length mouse PSD-95, PICK1, and GRIP1 cDNAs were obtained from Open Biosystems (catalogue numbers EMM1002-11769, MMM1013-9200227, and MMM1013-98478796, respectively, corresponding to GenBankTM BC_014807, GenBankTM BC_048788, and BC_067398). The full-length PSD-95 cDNA and fragments corresponding to amino acids 245–517, 245–447, and 397–721 were cloned into pVP16-3 (Clontech) using NotI and XbaI for use in two-hybrid assays. The mouse PICK1 cDNA (and a fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–200) and GRIP 1 cDNA (and fragment corresponding to amino acids 401–800) were cloned into pVP16-3 at EcoRI and BglII sites. The mouse DHHC5 carboxyl-terminal fragment (amino acids 220–715) was cloned into the pCMV-HA vector (Clontech) using EcoRI and BglII sites to generate the plasmid pHA-CtermDHHC5. Plasmid pHA-CtermDHHC5ΔEISV that deletes the extreme carboxyl terminus of DHHC5 was generated from the parent plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II XL, Stratagene). The full-length mouse PSD95 was cloned into pcDNA-Myc-His vector (Invitrogen) using NheI and XhoI sites and into pEFGP-C1 (Clontech) using XhoI and SacII sites. The coding regions of all the above plasmids were sequenced to ensure integrity of the constructs. Further details of plasmid construction including primer sequences are available upon request. A mouse embryonic stem cell line (RRD553, strain 129/Ola) with an insertional mutation in DHHC5 was obtained from BayGenomics (24Stryke D. Kawamoto M. Huang C.C. Johns S.J. King L.A. Harper C.A.

The gene-trapping vector, pGT11xf, was designed to introduce an in-frame fusion between the 5′ exons of the trapped gene and a reporter, βgeo (a fusion of β-galactosidase and neomycin phosphotransferase II). To determine the location of the genomic insertion site in the RRD553 stem cell line, genomic DNA was extracted from the embryonic stem cells using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen). PCR was then performed using primers fp1 (within exon 3 of DHHC5, 5′-CCAGGACTAAGCCTGAATGTGTCACC-3′) and rp1 (within the βgeo gene of the gene-trapping vector, 5′-TGCCCAGTCATAGCCGAATA-3′), and the PCR product was sequenced to determine the insertion site. The embryonic stem cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to create chimeric mice, which were bred with C57BL/6 mice to generate heterozygous DHHC5-deficient mice. The heterozygous mice were then interbred to generate all genotypes of DHHC5-deficient mice. The mice were weaned at 21 days of age and housed in an approved barrier facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle. All animal experiments were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Genomic DNA was extracted from mouse tail tips using the Puregene Core Kit A (Qiagen). Approximately 10–20 μg of genomic DNA was digested with EcoRV and PvuII and analyzed by Southern blot. A probe (163 bp) was generated by polymerase chain amplification from mouse genomic DNA using primers 5′-CAGGTGTCCAGGACTAAGCC-3′ and 5′-CAACAGGGAGCTTACATGAGA-3′ derived from sequences within DHHC5 exon 3 (NCBI Entrez Gene ID 228136). The wild-type and mutant alleles are detected as 6.0- and 4.7-kb bands, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from whole mouse brains using an RNeasy Lipid Tissue Midi kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand synthesis was performed using RNA (1 μg) and random primers using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR was performed using iTaq Supermax with ROX (Bio-Rad). The TaqMan primers, corresponding to sequences in exons 3 and 4 of DHHC5, were obtained from Applied Biosystems (assay ID Mm00523158_m1). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sequences were used for normalization (assay ID Mm03302249_g1). The thermal cycling conditions were 3 min at 95 °C followed by 50 cycles of denaturation for 15 s at 95 °C and annealing for 45 s at 60 °C. Normalized data were used to compare relative levels of DHHC5 in +/+, +/gt, and gt/gt samples using ΔΔCt analysis (27Yang S.H. Shrivastav A. Kosinski C. Sharma R.K. Chen M.H. Berthiaume L.G.

Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide narcosis, and tissues were quickly extracted on ice. Each tissue sample was homogenized in four volumes of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA with 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) using a Brinkman Polytron homogenizer. Unbroken tissue and cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The whole membrane lysate was extracted from the pellet using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1× complete protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 1 h. The protein sample was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Synaptic plasma membrane fractionation was performed according to a previously published method with some modifications (28Bouvier D. Corera A.T. Tremblay M.E. Riad M. Chagnon M. Murai K.K. Pasquale E.B. Fon E.A. Doucet G. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 682-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Procedures were carried out at 4 °C, and all buffers contained complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, whole brain tissues were pooled from six adult mice and homogenized in 15 volumes of Tris acetate (TA) buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10% (w/v) sucrose) using a glass-Teflon homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min to obtain a crude nuclear pellet (P1) and supernatant (S1). The S1 fraction was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting mitochondrial pellet (P2) was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2 mm CaCl2 and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet (P3) was resuspended in 5 volumes of hypotonic TA buffer (5 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 2 mm CaCl2) and incubated on ice for 45 min. Solid sucrose was added to this fraction to 35% (w/v) and then layered on the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. TA buffer containing 20 and 10% (w/v) sucrose constituted the middle and upper layers, respectively. The gradient was centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 2 h in a swinging bucket rotor, and the synaptosomal fraction was collected from the 35–20% sucrose interface. The synaptosomal fraction was diluted with 3 volumes of TA buffer and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting synaptosomal pellet was resuspended in TA buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 30 min. The supernatant containing the presynaptic membrane fraction was recovered, and the pellet containing the postsynaptic membrane fraction was resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to Immobilon membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting. A rat brain cDNA library (postnatal day 8) cloned into the prey vector pVP16-3 was a generous gift of Dr. Thomas Sudhof (29Yamaguchi T. Dulubova I. Min S.W. Chen X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). L40 yeast strains harboring the bait vector (pLexN) expressing the carboxyl-terminal fragment of mouse DHHC5 protein (amino acids 220–715 cloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites) and prey vector (pVP16-3) containing the rat brain cDNA library were grown on CSM-WLH (−Trp/−Leu/−His) plates (Clontech). In this protocol, only those clones that contain DHHC5-interacting partners will induce the transcription of the HIS3 gene and survive selection in the absence of histidine. A total of 100 clones were randomly selected for sequencing. The yeast DNA was extracted and subjected to PCR using primers within the vector sequence; V1 (5′-GTTTACCGATGCCCTTGG-3′) and V2 (5′-CGTTGTAAAACGACGGCC-3′). The PCR products were sequenced using V1 primer. Two rounds of selection and sequencing were performed. To confirm the interactions between DHHC5 and PDZ domain-containing proteins, similarly, L40 yeast strains harboring the bait vector (pLexN) expressing amino acids 220–715 of the mouse DHHC5 protein and prey vectors (pVP16-3) expressing fragments of the PDZ domain-containing proteins were grown on CSM-WLH (−Trp/−Leu/−His) plates. Interactions in yeast were confirmed using a semi-quantitative β-galactosidase assay (29Yamaguchi T. Dulubova I. Min S.W. Chen X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation of DHHC5 and PSD-95 in transfected cells, HEK 293 cells were transfected either with PSD-95-Myc or HA-CtermDHHC5 or HA-CtermDHHC5ΔEISV as indicated. After 48 h, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with four volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA) containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). For the co-immunoprecipitation assay, 500 μg of cell lysate was diluted to 500 μl using Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 0,02% sodium azide) and pre-cleared with 25 μl of Protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h. The pre-cleared solution was incubated with either anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10) (3 μg, Santa Cruz) or anti-HA ascites (6 μg, Covance) at 4 °C for 1 h followed by incubation with 25 μl of Protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with Buffer A and then eluted with 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Eluted samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. To analyze co-immunoprecipitation of DHHC5 and PSD-95 in vivo, mouse brain tissues were homogenized in four volumes of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, with 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) using a motor-driven homogenizer. The unbroken tissue and cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 - g for 1 h. The whole membrane lysate was extracted from the pellet using Buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing 1× complete protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 1 h. The protein sample was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube. For co-immunoprecipitation assay, 600 μg of brain membrane lysate was pre-cleared with 25 μl of Protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h. The pre-cleared solution was incubated with anti-PSD 95 monoclonal antibody (1:40 dilution, 6G6–1C9, Abcam) at 4 °C for 1 h followed by an incubation with 25 μl of Protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. Normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz sc-2025) at the same concentration was used as a negative control. After incubation, the beads were washed 3 times with Buffer B and then eluted with 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Eluted samples were subjected to immunoblotting using the anti-DHHC5 (Sigma HPA014670) or anti-PSD-95 (Synaptic Systems) rabbit polyclonal antibodies. All mice were male and female littermates ∼10–12 weeks of age at the time of testing. Mice were group housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. Behavioral testing occurred during the light cycle. Tests for locomotor activity, open field behavior, motor coordination (Rotarod), and fear conditioning were performed; all mice received all tests. Locomotor activity was assessed by placing mice individually into a clean, plastic mouse cage (18 × 28 cm) with a small amount of bedding that was located inside a dark Plexiglas box. Movement was monitored by 5 photobeams in one dimension (Photobeam Activity System, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) for 2 h, with the number of beam breaks recorded every 5 min. For open field activity testing, mice were individually placed in the periphery of a novel open field environment (44 × 44 cm, walls 30 cm high) and allowed to explore for 5 min. The animals were monitored from above by a video camera connected to a computer running video tracking software (Ethovision 3.0, Noldus, Leesburg, VA) to determine the time, distance moved, and number of entries into two areas: the periphery (5 cm from the walls) and the center (14 × 14 cm). The open field arenas were wiped with disinfectant and allowed to dry between mice. For motor coordination testing, mice were placed on a rotarod (model 755, IITC Life Science Inc., Woodland Hills, CA). The rod was then accelerated from 5 to 45 rpm over 5 min. The time that each mouse fell from the rod was recorded. If a mouse held onto the rod and rotated completely around two times, this was recorded as a fall from the rod at that time. Each mouse was tested four times (15–30 min inter-trial interval) each day for two consecutive days. Fear conditioning was measured in boxes equipped with a metal grid floor connected to a scrambled shock generator (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, VT). On the first day (training) mice were individually placed in the testing chamber and after 2 min received 2 tone-shock pairings (30-s white noise, 95-db tone co-terminated with a 2-s, 0.5-mA foot-shock, 1-min intertrial interval) and were removed from the chamber 1 min after the last shock. Twenty-four hours after training, memory of the context was measured by placing the mice into the same chambers, and freezing was manually measured every 5 s for 5 min. Forty-eight hours after training, memory for the white noise cue was measured by placing the mice in a box with altered floors and walls, lighting, and a vanilla smell. Freezing was manually measured every 5 s for 3 min, then the noise cue was turned on for an additional 3 min, and freezing was measured every 5 s. The experimenter rating the freezing was blind to the genotype of the animals. Approximately 1 week after fear conditioning, the animals were assessed for foot-shock sensitivity. The mice were placed into the same chambers and given a foot-shock every 15 s. For this test, the first foot-shock was 0.05 mA and increased by 0.05-mA intervals. The first shock that evoked a flinch response and jump, and vocalization was recorded. To investigate the extent of the DHHC5 immunoreactivity within the brains of wild-type and DHHC5 gt/gt mice, a one-in-six series of free-floating 40-μm frozen coronal sections from each animal was stained via a modified version of a previously published immunoperoxidase protocol (30Bible E. Gupta P. Hofmann S.L. Cooper J.D. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 16: 346-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Sections underwent antigen retrieval via heating in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 30 min at 80 °C and were allowed to cool to room temperature. To quench endogenous peroxidase activity, sections were incubated for 30 min in 1% H2O2 and subsequently blocked for 40 min in 15% normal goat serum in Tris-buffered saline, 0.3% Triton X-100 (TBS-T). Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in polyclonal rabbit anti-DHHC5 (1:250) diluted in TBS-T containing 10% normal goat serum. Subsequently, sections were rinsed in TBS and incubated for 2 h with secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK, 1:1000) diluted in TBS-T containing 10% normal goat serum. After rinsing in TBS, sections were incubated for 2 h in avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) diluted in TBS. After rinsing in TBS, DHHC5 immunoreactivity was visualized by incubation in 0.05% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) and 0.001% H202 for 25 min, a sufficient time to ensure saturation for this reaction. Sections were rinsed in TBS, mounted onto slides, air-dried, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped in DPX (Sigma). Appropriate negative controls where the primary antibody was omitted were included in each experiment. To study the function of the DHHC5 gene in vivo, DHHC5-deficient mice were derived from a mouse embryonic cell line (RRD553) generated by random insertional mutagenesis of 129/Ola embryonic stem cells at BayGenomics and distributed by the International Gene Trap Consortium (25Skarnes W.C. von Melchner H.

https://openalex.org/W2057488300,"Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), a cytosolic receptor of cholesterol and oxysterols, is recruited to the endoplasmic reticulum by binding to the cytoplasmic major sperm protein (MSP) domain of integral endoplasmic reticulum protein VAMP-associated protein-A (VAP-A), a process essential for the stimulation of sphingomyelin synthesis by 25-hydroxycholesterol. To delineate the interaction mechanism between VAP-A and OSBP, we determined the complex structure between the VAP-A MSP domain (VAP-A(MSP)) and the OSBP fragment containing a VAP-A binding motif FFAT (OSBP(F)) by NMR. This solution structure explained that five of six conserved residues in the FFAT motif are required for the stable complex formation, and three of five, including three critical intermolecular electrostatic interactions, were not explained before. By combining NMR relaxation and titration, isothermal titration calorimetry, and mutagenesis experiments with structural information, we further elucidated the detailed roles of the FFAT motif and underlying motions of VAP-A(MSP), OSBP(F), and the complex. Our results show that OSBP(F) is disordered in the free state, and VAP-A(MSP) and OSBP(F) form a final complex by means of intermediates, where electrostatic interactions through acidic residues, including an acid patch preceding the FFAT motif, probably play a collective role. Additionally, we report that the mutation that causes the familial motor neuron disease decreases the stability of the MSP domain."
https://openalex.org/W1971382545,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) transduces noxious chemical and physical stimuli in high-threshold nociceptors. The pivotal role of TRPV1 in the physiopathology of pain transduction has thrust the identification and characterization of interacting partners that modulate its cellular function. Here, we report that TRPV1 associates with gamma-amino butyric acid A-type (GABA(A)) receptor associated protein (GABARAP) in HEK293 cells and in neurons from dorsal root ganglia coexpressing both proteins. At variance with controls, GABARAP augmented TRPV1 expression in cotransfected cells and stimulated surface receptor clustering. Functionally, GABARAP expression attenuated voltage and capsaicin sensitivity of TRPV1 in the presence of extracellular calcium. Furthermore, the presence of the anchor protein GABARAP notably lengthened the kinetics of vanilloid-induced tachyphylaxia. Notably, the presence of GABARAP selectively increased the interaction of tubulin with the C-terminal domain of TRPV1. Disruption of tubulin cytoskeleton with nocodazole reduced capsaicin-evoked currents in cells expressing TRPV1 and GABARAP, without affecting the kinetics of vanilloid-induced desensitization. Taken together, these findings indicate that GABARAP is an important component of the TRPV1 signaling complex that contributes to increase the channel expression, to traffic and cluster it on the plasma membrane, and to modulate its functional activity at the level of channel gating and desensitization."

https://openalex.org/W1988775133,"The ape2 gene encoding a hypothetical O-acetylpeptidoglycan esterase was amplified from genomic DNA of Neisseria gonorrhoeae FA1090 and cloned to encode either the full-length protein or a truncated version lacking its hypothetical signal sequence. Expression trials revealed that production of the full-length version possessing either an N-terminal or C-terminal His(6) tag was toxic to Escherichia coli transformants and that the host rapidly degraded the small amount of protein that was produced. An N-terminally truncated protein could be produced in sufficient yields for purification only if it possessed an N-terminal His(6) tag. This form of the protein was isolated and purified to apparent homogeneity, and its enzymatic properties were characterized. Whereas the protein could bind to insoluble peptidoglycan, it did not function as an esterase. Phenotypic characterization of E. coli transformants producing various forms of the protein revealed that it functions instead to O-acetylate peptidoglycan within the periplasm, and it was thus renamed peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferase B. This activity was found to be dependent upon a second protein, which functions to translocate acetate from the cytoplasm to the periplasm, demonstrating that the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan in N. gonorrhoeae, and other gram-negative bacteria, requires a two component system."

This molybdenum-containing CODH is distinct from the highly O2-sensitive, Ni/Fe-containing CODH from obligate anaerobes such as Clostridum thermoaceticum or Methanosarcina barkerii (5Ragsdale S.W.

Both are (αβγ)2 hexamers consisting of a small subunit (CoxS, 17.8 kDa) that has two [2Fe-2S] clusters, a medium subunit (CoxM, 30.2 kDa) that possesses FAD, and a large subunit (CoxL, 88.7 kDa) that has the active site molybdenum center (11Schübel U.

Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). Given the nature of the reaction catalyzed, however, CODH is of interest to gain a better understanding of the general activity of such molybdenum centers in biology. CODH is also of significant environmental interest as it is involved in the clearance of CO from the environment. Aerobic organisms such as O. carboxidovorans have been estimated to remove ∼2 × 108 metric tons of CO from the atmosphere annually (14Moersdorf G. Frunzke K. Gadkari D. Meyer O. Biodegradation. 1992; 3: 61-82Google Scholar). Despite some initial confusion about the structure of the active site of CODH, the metal center has recently been established by high resolution x-ray crystallography (6Dobbek H. Gremer L. Meyer O.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to be a binuclear [CuISMoVI] cluster, with the two metal atoms bridged by a μ-sulfido ligand. A reaction mechanism has been proposed involving the formation of an SCO2 intermediate, on the basis of the crystal structure of CODH in complex with the inhibitor n-butylisocyanide (7Dobbek H. Gremer L. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Meyer O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15971-15976Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, computational studies suggest that such a thiocarbonate intermediate actually leads to a deep minimum on the potential energy surface, making CO2 release extremely difficult (16Hofmann M.

Chem. 2005; 26: 888-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, model compound studies suggest that CO oxidation could occur directly at the Cu(I) site, followed by electron transfer to Mo via the electronic delocalization of the Mo(μ-S)Cu moiety (18Gourlay C.

Here, we report a study of the kinetic and spectroscopic properties of CODH to gain better insight into the nature of the active site and the mechanism by which CO is oxidized. Carbon monoxide gas was obtained from Airgas at a purity of 99.5%. Isotopically enriched 98MoO3 (98Mo, 99%), 13CO (13C, 99%), and D2O (2H, 99.9%) were from Cambridge Isotope Lab, Inc. All other chemicals and reagents were obtained at the highest quality/purity available commercially and were used without further purification. O. carboxydovorans (ATCC 49405) was cultivated at 30 °C, pH 7 in a 20-liter fermentor (BioFlo 415, New Brunswick) containing carboxydobacterium medium (9Gremer L. Kellner S. Dobbek H. Huber R. Meyer O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1864-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with a gas mixture of 50% CO and 50% air. Cells were harvested in the late exponential phase (A436 >5), washed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), and stored at −80 °C. 98Mo-enriched CODH was obtained from O. carboxydovorans grown in 98MoO3-substituted medium. CODH was purified using the procedure described by Meyer et al. (9Gremer L. Kellner S. Dobbek H. Huber R. Meyer O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1864-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Hänzelmann P. Meyer O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with some modifications. All chromatography steps were carried out on an ÄKTA purifier (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. About 60 g of thawed cells were suspended in 100 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mg of DNase I, and disrupted with a French press (FA-078A, Thermo Electron Co.). Cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The supernatant was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (40 cm × 2.6 cm) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and eluted with seven column volumes of a linear gradient of 0–0.8 m NaCl in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Fractions possessing CODH activity (see below) were pooled, concentrated in an Amicon concentrator with 100-kDa MW cut-off, and passed through a Sephacryl S-300 column (40 cm × 2.6 cm) equilibrated (and eluted) with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Fractions were analyzed for both CODH activity and optical spectra, and only those of high activity and spectral purity (as judged by the absence of heme contaminants absorbing at 420 nm) were pooled and concentrated. Purified enzyme had an absorbance ratio of A280/A450 ∼5.5 and A450/A550 ∼2.9, and exhibited only three bands by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% stacking gel and 12% resolving gel) and a single band by non-denaturing PAGE (5% stacking gel and 7.5% resolving gel). The purified enzyme was stored in liquid nitrogen until needed. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient of purified enzyme at 450 nm was determined to be 70 mm−1 cm−1 for the (αβγ)2 hexamer, very close to the reported value of 72 mm−1 cm−1 (21Meyer O. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5612-5617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Resch M. Dobbek H. Meyer O. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2005; 10: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which was used to calculate the concentration of enzyme. CODH activity was monitored spectrophotometrically by the CO-dependent reduction of methylene blue (ϵ615 = 37.11 mm−1 cm−1) at 30 °C (23Kraut M. Hugendieck I. Herwig S. Meyer O. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 152: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A rubber septum-stoppered cuvette containing 50 μm methylene blue in 2 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2 was bubbled with 100% CO for 10 min, and then 10 to 20 μl of anaerobic enzyme was injected via Hamilton syringe to initiate the reaction. The absorbance change was monitored at 615 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (HP 8452A). With one unit of activity defined as 1 μmol of CO oxidized per min at 30 °C, pure CODH exhibited a specific activity of 11.3 units/mg with methylene blue as the electron acceptor. Fully functional enzyme was earlier reported to have a specific activity of ∼24 units/mg using 1-phenyl-2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium chloride (INT) and 1-methoxyphenazine methosulfate (MPMS) as the electron acceptors (7Dobbek H. Gremer L. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Meyer O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15971-15976Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In our hands, the INT/MPMS assay was >1.5 times faster than that with methylene blue under the same conditions, indicating that our enzyme preparation had comparable activity to that seen previously. Fe, Mo, Cu, and Se contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Optima 3000 DV, Perkin Elmer). Analysis of the results revealed 8.05 Fe, 1.82 Mo, and 1.69 Cu per mol of enzyme dimer. Mo and Cu are both essential for CODH activity (15Gnida M. Ferner R. Gremer L. Meyer O. Meyer-Klaucke W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Resch M. Dobbek H. Meyer O. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2005; 10: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and these results suggest that ∼15% of our CODH preparation is nonfunctional because of incomplete metal incorporation into apoprotein. Reductive titrations of CODH were carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2 or 50 mm CAPS, 0.1 n NaCl, pH 10 at room temperature (22 °C). Enzyme, typically at a concentration of ∼10 μm, was made anaerobic in a sealed cuvette by repeated vacuum-flushing with argon. Sodium dithionite was dissolved in anaerobic buffer and titrated into the enzyme solution via a gas-tight syringe. The concentration of sodium dithionite in the stock solution was determined from the absorbance at 314 nm (ϵ = 8.0 mm−1 cm−1; Ref. 24Di Lorio Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 58Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetics was carried out under anaerobic conditions in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2 at 25 °C using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics). One syringe was loaded with anaerobic CODH (4.4 nm, after mixing), and the other with CO-flushed methylene blue (36 μm) in KH2PO4 buffer. The concentrations of CO were calculated based on a solubility of 1.0 mm at 1 atm and 25 °C (25Dean J.A. Lange's Handbook of Chemistry. 12th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1972Google Scholar). CO concentrations of 10–438 μm were obtained by mixing CO-flushed methylene blue with argon-flushed methylene blue. Absorbance changes were monitored at 615 nm, and the initial rates were plotted against CO concentration to obtain kcat and Km. The reductive half-reaction of CODH (i.e., the reaction of Eox with CO under anaerobic conditions) was carried out by stopped-flow at 4 °C, over the pH range 5.5–10. Enzyme concentrations of 6–10 μm were mixed with various concentrations of CO, and the spectral change recorded over an appropriate period of time. The activation energy of CODH reduction by CO was determined at pH 7.2 and pH 10 from the temperature dependence of the reaction of enzyme with 1.0 mm CO over the temperature range 4 to 30 °C. The fast phases of the kinetic traces (see below) were fit to single exponentials using Pro-Kineticist software to obtain the observed rate constant (kobs). EPR spectra were recorded using a Brüker Instruments ER 300 spectrometer equipped with an ER 035 m gaussmeter and a HP 5352B microwave frequency counter. Temperature was controlled at 150 K using a Brüker ER 4111VT liquid N2 cryostat. In experiments with substoichiometric CO, 200 μl of 50 μm anaerobic CODH in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2 were added to a sealed EPR tube filled with argon. 10 μl of CO-flushed buffer (containing ∼23 μm CO) were then added and mixed by micropipetting. The solution was incubated for 10 s, then frozen in an acetone/liquid nitrogen bath. Other samples were prepared by reacting CODH with excess reductant (CO or sodium dithionite). A frozen water sample was used for background correction. The EPR spectrum of reduced CODH in D2O was obtained by exchanging CODH into Tris-D2O buffer (50 mm, pD 7.6) by passage of enzyme through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with that buffer, followed by reaction with excess CO. The EPR spectrum of enzyme reduced with 13CO was obtained simply by reaction with 13C-labeled CO (99%, Cambridge Isotope Lab) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Simulation of the EPR spectrum of CO-reduced 98Mo-labeled CODH was performed using EasySpin, a free software developed by Stefan Stoll at University of California, Davis. Resonance Raman spectra were obtained using 514.5 nm excitation from a Coherent Innova 307 argon ion laser. Raman-scattered light was collected and dispersed using a single-stage spectrograph into a Princeton Instruments 1024 KTB, back-thinned, charge-coupled device detector. Calibration was performed using an external indene standard with reported band positions accurate to ±2 cm−1. Data were collected from the surface of a 30-μl sample (∼250 μm, in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2) held at 30 K in a custom-built cold finger with a APD Cryogenics closed-cycle helium refrigerator. Samples were illuminated at 30 K for several hours prior to data collection to reduce background fluorescence. This procedure did not demonstrably change the resonance Raman line positions, but simply reduced the background. To assess the catalytic competence of the CODH used here, the extent of reduction of the enzyme by CO under anaerobic conditions was compared with that by dithionite (7Dobbek H. Gremer L. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Meyer O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15971-15976Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, exposure to CO for 1 min reduced the absorbance at 450 nm by ∼62% in comparison to the dithionite-reduced enzyme, depending on the preparation. Further incubation of the enzyme with CO (∼30 min) resulted in complete reduction, similar to the dithionite-reduced form. Such behavior has been observed with other Mo-containing enzymes, notably xanthine oxidoreductase (13Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar), and has been ascribed to the presence of a certain amount of non-functional enzyme that becomes reduced by slow intermolecular electron transfer from the reduced functional enzyme (which subsequently reacts with more substrate to become fully reduced once again). In all experiments described here, the concentration of functional enzyme was used, correcting the total enzyme concentration for the amount of non-functional enzyme determined as described above. Fig. 2 shows reductive titrations of CODH with sodium dithionite as performed at pH 7.2 and pH 10. In total, approximately twelve reducing equivalents per CODH dimer were required to reach the end point (Fig. 2A, inset), consistent with the constitution of the protein redox-active centers. At pH 7.2, the first four reducing equivalents resulted in a significant decrease in absorbance at 450 nm and a slight increase above 550 nm, suggesting accumulation of the neutral FADH• semiquinone. Further titration resulted in a decrease in absorbance at both 450 nm and 550 nm, consistent with reduction of FADH• on to FADH2 along with additional reduction of the Fe/S clusters. The relative reduction potentials of FAD and Fe/S centers were gauged by plotting the fractional absorbance changes at 450 nm (where the FAD and Fe/S centers contribute approximately equally to the absorbance change observed upon reduction of the enzyme) versus 550 nm (where the Fe/S centers are responsible for the entirety of the spectral change) (26Olson J.S. Ballou D.P. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4363-4382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hille R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8522-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows plots of the fractional absorbance change at 550 nm versus that at 450 nm seen in reductive titrations at pH 7.2 and pH 10. The data at pH 7.2 resemble those seen previously with XOR (27Hille R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8522-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the pH 10 data continue to trend toward the lower right in the plot, whereas with XOR at pH 10 the plot trends strongly to the upper left (27Hille R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8522-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results indicate that, particularly at high pH, the midpoint potential of FAD is substantially higher relative to the average of the potentials for the two Fe/S clusters in CODH (we estimate by at least 30 mV), whereas the reverse is true with XOR. Fig. 3A shows the [CO] dependence of turnover at 25 °C using methylene blue as the electron acceptor. The data yield a kcat of 57.8 s−1 and Km of 10.7 μm, with a kcat/Km of 8.7 × 106 m−1 s−1. As shown in Fig. 1C, the enzyme used in the assay was ∼62% active (as judged by the functionality test described above), and the corrected turnover number for the fully functional enzyme is thus 93.3 s−1. This compares favorably with the value of 107 s−1 at 30 °C seen with INT as the electron acceptor (7Dobbek H. Gremer L. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Meyer O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15971-15976Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), particularly when the 5 °C difference in temperature is taken into account. CODH has a pH optimum of ∼7.2 (Fig. 3B), the pH at which most of the experiments here were carried out. It is noteworthy, however, that even at extremes in pH where the enzyme is only marginally stable CODH retains more than half of its maximal activity (Fig. 3B). The only modest loss of activity at these extreme pHs indicates that ionization of functional groups in the active site is not as critical to catalysis for CODH as has been found for XOR (30Kim J.H. Ryan M.G. Knaut H. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6771-6780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The rapid reaction kinetics of CODH with CO were determined at pH 7.2, 4 °C using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Enzyme reduction was followed via the spectral change associated with reduction of the (functional) enzyme. Fig. 4A shows the time course seen for the absorption change at 450 nm. The reaction is distinctly biphasic, with a fast phase occurring in the first 500 ms, followed by a much slower reaction on a hundreds of seconds time scale (Fig. 4A, inset). By analogy to the kinetic behavior seen with XOR (31Leimkühler S. Stoker A.L. Igarashi K. Nishino T. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40437-40444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the initial fast phase of the reaction is attributed to the reduction of the functional portion of the enzyme, after which a slow intermolecular transfer of reducing equivalents to the nonfunctional portion of the enzyme occurs (with subsequent re-reduction of the functional enzyme). The relative amplitudes of the fast and slow phases suggest that the enzyme used was ∼65% functional, in good agreement with the above spectrophotometric results. Surprisingly, at all pH values examined, no [CO] dependence of kobs for the fast phase of the reaction (hereafter referred to as kred) is observed over the concentration range 30 to 476 μm (Fig. 4A). At pH 7.2 and 4 °C, kred is determined to be 11.4 s−1. The rate constant for the slower phase of the reaction is found to be modestly pH-dependent. At higher pH the intermolecular electron transfer becomes somewhat faster (kslowapp = 0.046 and 0.070 s−1 at pH 7 and 9, respectively). Because kred exhibited no dependence on [CO], no Kd could be determined. This kinetic behavior resembles that seen with XOR and slow substrates, and is consistent with the initial rapid formation of a CuI·CO complex prior to oxidation of substrate, as has been suggested in the literature (16Hofmann M. Kassube J.K. Graf T. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2005; 10: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Siegbahn P.E. Shestakov A.F. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 888-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Gourlay C. Nielsen D.J. White J.M. Knottenbelt S.Z. Kirk M.L. Young C.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 2164-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of kred exhibits a maximum at pH 7.2 (Fig. 4C), in agreement with the above steady-state results and suggesting that the rate-limiting step of turnover is in the reductive half-reaction. The temperature dependence of kred was investigated at pH 7.2 and pH 10 under CO-saturating conditions. Table 1 lists the activation parameters calculated from both an Arrhenius (Fig. 5A) and an Eyring (Fig. 5B) analysis of the data. The activation energy for the reaction of CODH with CO is 47.8 kJ/mol at pH 7.2 and 43.1 kJ/mol at pH 10.TABLE 1Activation parameters of CODH reduction by CO at pH 7.2 and pH 10pH 7.2pH 10Ea, kJ/mol47.843.1ΔH≠, kJ/mol45.440.7ΔS≠, J/K·mol−60.4−83.9ΔG, kJ/mol63.465.7 Open table in a new tab At 25 °C and pH 7.2, kred is 51.1 s−1, some 4-fold faster than at 4 °C. This value is approximately half the observed kcat of 93.3 s−1 from steady-state kinetics at the same temperature (after correction for nonfunctional enzyme). This disparity has been accounted for previously by Olson et al. (26Olson J.S. Ballou D.P. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4363-4382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the case of XOR, and is due to the fact that under the present reaction conditions three successive substrate molecules must react with enzyme to achieve complete reduction. The observed kred has been shown to underestimate the actual rate constant for an individual step by a factor of two. Taking this into consideration, kred as determined from the rapid reaction kinetics (51 s−1) agrees well with the steady-state kcat (93 s−1). In conjunction with the similar pH dependence seen for the steady-state and reductive half-reaction kinetics, this indicates that the latter is principally rate-limiting in CODH catalysis. At pH 7.2 and 4 °C, the kinetic transients at 520 nm exhibit a small initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease (Fig. 4B, lower curve). The amplitude of the first phase is very small, with an apparent rate constant estimated to be 65 s−1. For the second phase kobs is 10.2 s−1, in good agreement with the value of 11.4 s−1 seen at 450 nm. The transient absorbance increase is pH-dependent. At pH 5.5 the initial increase becomes more pronounced; but at pH 9 or 10, only a lag phase is observed, with no transient absorbance increase (Fig. 4B, upper curve). In combination with the reductive titration data discussed above, we conclude that the transient absorption increase is due to FADH• accumulating in partially reduced enzyme forms (CODH2e−, CODH4e−) generated early in the course of the reaction with CO. Reaction of enzyme with substoichiometric concentrations of substrate has proven useful in simplifying the observed kinetics of other systems, because under these conditions no enzyme molecule is likely to react with more than one equivalent of substrate (29McWhirter R.B. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23724-23731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6A shows the difference spectra (relative to oxidized enzyme) seen in the course of the reaction of 12.5 μm CODH with either 1.86 or 3.72 μm CO in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. They exhibit well-maintained isosbestic points at 370 and 496 nm. The absorbance at 450 nm decreases monotonically and in proportion to the substrate concentration (Fig. 6B). The observed rate constant is 16.7 s−1, slightly greater than that with excess CO. Above 520 nm the absorbance increases (kobs = 29.5 s−1) and does not subsequently decrease as is seen in the reaction with excess CO, again reflecting significant accumulation of FADH• in the reaction. To confirm that the neutral FADH• semiquinone is indeed formed to a significant degree upon partial reduction of the enzyme, we examined the enzyme by EPR spectroscopy. The spectrum of CODH reduced with limiting CO yields an isotropic radical signal centered at g ∼2.003 with a peak-to-trough line width of 20 G (Fig. 7A), indicative of the neutral flavin semiquinone. The integrated spin intensity of this isotropic signal, calibrated using a Cu-EDTA standard, accounted for ∼20% of FADH• accumulation. Functional CODH is EPR silent in the air-oxidized state, implying that the copper ion in the active site is present as Cu(I). Inactive CODH, by contrast, shows a small resting Mo(V) signal resembling the “Resting I” and “Inhibited” signals seen with XOR (22Resch M. Dobbek H. Meyer O. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2005; 10: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Bray R.C. George G.N. Lange R. Meyer O. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that is presumably because of enzyme that has lost the catalytically essential copper and bridging sulfur. In our hands, the EPR spectra of CO- or dithionite-reduced CODH (Fig. 7, B and C) were essentially identical, but differed in detail to previously published spectra (the latter appearing to arise from more than one paramagnetic species; Ref. 22Resch M. Dobbek H. Meyer O. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2005; 10: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our spectrum has well-resolved structure suggestive of hyperfine interactions with both Mo and Cu nuclei. The small satellite features attributable to the combined 25% natural abundance of 95Mo and 97Mo (18Gourlay C. Nielsen D.J. White J.M. Knottenbelt S.Z. Kirk M.L. Young C.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 2164-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), at 3275, 3575, and 3625 G, are lost in 98Mo-labeled enzyme (Fig. 7 F, solid line). The quartet features arising from the I = 3/2 nuclei of 63,65Cu are readily evident in the spectrum, and are readily reproduced in simulations (Fig. 7F, dashed line). The parameters from this simulation are g1,2,3 = 2.0010, 1.9604, 1.9549 and A1,2,3 = 117, 164, 132 MHz, with Euler angles α = 0, β = 40, γ = 40. The high quality of the simulation demonstrates that the EPR signal in question arises from a single paramagnetic species. CODH reduced with CO in D2O shows the identical EPR spectrum (Fig. 7D) as in H2O, with no discernible narrowing even of the observed linewidths. The expected hyperfine splitting for an equatorial Mo-OH in systems analogous to that seen in CO dehydrogenase (that is, those having a square pyramidal coordination geometry for the molybdenum with an apical Mo=O group) is in the range 3–14 G, and splittings of this magnitude yield demonstrable doublet structure in the EPR signal. In the “Rapid type 1” signal of xanthine oxidase, for example, a doublet of doublets is observed due to proton hyperfine splitting from the equatorial Mo-OH and Mo-SH ligands of 3 and 14 G, respectively. In the “Rapid type 2” signal of this enzyme, the Mo-OH splitting grows to 13 G, yielding a 1:2:1 triplet due to two approximately equally strongly coupled protons. As demonstrated in the classic work of Bray and coworkers (33Pick F.M. Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1969; 114: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 34Bray R.C. Barber M.J. Lowe D.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 171: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the Mo-OH and Mo-SH protons of the “rapid” signals of xanthine oxidase are solvent-exchangeable, and substitution into D2O collapses the hyperfine structure to give a single line for each principal g-value of the signals. 3Substitution of the 2H nucleus (I = 1) for the 1H (I = ½) results in loss of observable hyperfine structure because the nuclear moment of 2H is less than 1/3 that of 1H, with the result that the 1:1:1 triplet expected a priori is not resolved. The complexity of the EPR signal seen here with CO dehydrogenase notwithstanding, its linewidths (5–6 G) are comparable to those seen for the signals observed with xanthine oxidase and loss of proton splitting even as weak as 3 G would have led to a demonstrable narrowing of the features upon substitution into D2O. We conclude that the EPR-active Mo(V) state has no equatorial Mo-OH, and that the equatorial position is occupied by a fully deprotonated Mo=O group. This being the case, it is very unlikely that there will be one in the more oxidized Mo(VI) state of the oxidized enzyme. The equatorial oxygen ligand of Mo in oxidized CODH has been assigned as either a Mo-OH group on the basis of the high resolution crystal structure (7Dobbek H. Gremer L. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Meyer O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15971-15976Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) or a second Mo=O from x-ray absorption studies (15Gnida M. Ferner R. Gremer L. Meyer O. Meyer-Klaucke W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Our EPR result is consistent with the XAS work indicating a MoO2 core in the active site of oxidized enzyme. In a final EPR experiment, the spectrum of CODH reduced with 13C-labeled CO (Fig. 7E) was found to exhibit significant line-broadening, even (weak) doublet structure ∼3425 and 3470 G. The splitting of Mo(V) signal by 13C-labeled CO clearly demonstrates that CO/CO2 is present in the signal-giving species of substrate-reduced enzyme. The resonance Raman (rR) spectra of oxidized CODH at pH 7 and 10 (Fig. 8) exhibit features attributable to FAD (1300–1400 cm−1), Fe/S (300–350 cm−1), and two distinct bands at 895 and 861 cm−1, which we ascribe to the symmetric (vs) and antisymmetric (vas) Mo-Ooxo stretching modes, respectively, arising from a MoO2 core. These vibrational frequencies are similar to those previously observed in sulfite oxidase: vs(Mo-Ooxo) = 896 cm−1 and vas (Mo=O) = 864 cm−1 (35Hemann C. Hood B.L. Fulton M. Hänsch R. Schwarz G.

Soc. 1997; 119: 2590-2591Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and in Mo(VI) model compounds: vs(Mo-Ooxo) from 858 to 938 cm−1, and vas(Mo-Ooxo) from 835 to 898 cm−1 (37Johnson M.K. Stiefel E.I. Diothiolene Chemistry: Progress in Inorganic Chemistry. 52. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ2004: 213-266Google Scholar). The present rR results are thus also consistent with a CuSMoO2 core in the oxidized enzyme (15Gnida M. Ferner R. Gremer L. Meyer O. Meyer-Klaucke W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A CODH sample reduced with CO and then reoxidized in air reveals an rR spectrum similar to that of desulfo-XO (Fig. 8, upper panel), indicating that handling of the protein in this way results in loss of the Mo-S-Cu bond, yielding a catalytically inactive MoO3 core. This result is consistent with the previously observed inactivation of CODH in the presence of both CO and O2 (4Meyer O. Gremer L. Ferner R. Ferner M. Dobbek H. Gnida M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Huber R. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have examined the oxidation of CO by CODH using kinetic and spectroscopic methods. The enzyme exhibits a steady-state kcat of 93.3 s−1, similar to previous work (7Dobbek H. Gremer L. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Meyer O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15971-15976Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the observed rate constant kred for the reductive-half reaction of CODH with CO is 51.1 s−1 at 25 °C and pH 7.2, reflecting an intrinsic kred of 102 s−1 that is in good agreement with the steady-state kcat of 93.3 s−1. The absence of any dependence of kred on [CO] is consistent with the rapid formation of a complex of CO with enzyme prior to substrate oxidation. Previous computational and model compound studies have in fact suggested that the first step of the catalytic cycle is CO binding to the Cu(I) of the active site (17Siegbahn P.E. Shestakov A.F. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 888-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Gourlay C. Nielsen D.J. White J.M. Knottenbelt S.Z. Kirk M.L. Young C.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 2164-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The good agreement between steady-state and reductive half-reaction kinetics, as well as their similar pH dependences suggest that the reductive-half reaction is the rate-limiting step in CODH catalysis."

HSKO mice recapitulated the TD lipid phenotype with postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, markedly decreased LDL, and near absence of HDL.

In addition, data from case reports of 59 Tangier patients show variable TG concentrations, with mean, median, minimum, and maximum concentrations of 210, 175, 40, and 580 mg/dl, respectively (4Assman G. von Eckardstein A.

McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 2937-2960Google Scholar). The underlying mechanisms for the increased plasma TG and decreased LDL concentrations in TD subjects have not been established. In one study, apoA-II enrichment of VLDL of TD subjects was proposed to result in reduced reactivity of VLDL with lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (9Kolovou G. Daskalova D. Anagnostopoulou K. Hoursalas I.

Acta. 1987; 920: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Another study suggested that ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux decreases VLDL secretion from murine hepatocytes by limiting cholesterol availability for VLDL assembly (11Sahoo D. Trischuk T.C. Chan T. Drover V.A. Ho S. Chimini G. Agellon L.B. Agnihotri R. Francis G.A. Lehner R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1122-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, whether deficiency of ABCA1 is associated with increased apoB lipoprotein secretion in vivo is unknown.Recently, we reported that silencing of ABCA1 in rat hepatoma cells is associated with PI3K-dependent enhanced secretion of TG-enriched VLDL (12Chung S. Gebre A.K. Seo J. Shelness G.S. Parks J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 729-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role of hepatic ABCA1 expression in VLDL assembly and secretion. To determine whether hepatic ABCA1 expression affects VLDL secretion in vivo, we used loss of function and gain of function strategies with hepatocyte-specific gene targeting of ABCA1 and adenoviral overexpression of human ABCA1, respectively. We demonstrate that targeted inactivation of hepatic ABCA1 increases VLDL production and LDL clearance, recapitulating the TD lipid phenotype, and that adenoviral rescue of ABCA1 reverses the elevated plasma TG phenotype. These studies highlight a novel and important role for hepatic ABCA1 in regulating apoB Lp metabolism.DISCUSSIONIt is well established that ABCA1 influences HDL metabolism in humans, mice, and chickens (27Attie A.D. Kastelein J.P. Hayden M.R. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1717-1726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, its role in metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins remains elusive. In the present study, we demonstrated that targeted inactivation of ABCA1 in hepatocytes recapitulates the lipid phenotype of TD subjects, including reduced HDL and LDL cholesterol, and elevated TG concentrations. We established that part of the lipid phenotype associated with hepatic ABCA1 deficiency results from an increased secretion of TG-enriched hepatic VLDL via a PI3K-dependent pathway. We also documented decreased post-heparin lipolytic activity and increased hepatic LDLr expression, resulting in a net increase in clearance of LDL from the circulation. Furthermore, elevated plasma VLDL TG was rescued by adenoviral expression of human ABCA1, demonstrating the existence of a coupled regulatory pathway between HDL and apoB Lps through hepatic ABCA1. The combined results suggest that, in addition to its well recognized role in HDL biogenesis, hepatic ABCA1 plays a significant and complex role in apoB LP metabolism.Previously, we reported that silencing of ABCA1 in rat hepatoma cells decreased formation of large (>10-nm diameter) nascent HDL particles, increased secretion of large, buoyant TG-enriched VLDL, and attenuated PI3K activation (12Chung S. Gebre A.K. Seo J. Shelness G.S. Parks J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 729-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that the addition of nascent HDL particles, the product of ABCA1-mediated lipidation of apoA-I, to ABCA1-silenced hepatoma cells reversed the blockage of PI3K activation and restored the basal rate of TG secretion. The present study demonstrates the physiological relevance of our previous in vitro observations using rat hepatoma cells and suggests a new mechanism for the elevated plasma TG concentrations associated with TD. We show that selective hepatic ABCA1 deficiency in mice increases hepatic VLDL TG secretion ex vivo, using isolated liver perfusion (Fig. 2A) and cultured primary hepatocytes (Fig. 5D), and in vivo, using detergent to block VLDL catabolism (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, as assessed by both differential ultracentrifugation and dynamic laser light scatter data, hepatic ABCA1 deficiency resulted in the formation of larger, TG-enriched VLDL particles (Fig. 4, A and B), similar to our previous findings with rat hepatoma cells (12Chung S. Gebre A.K. Seo J. Shelness G.S. Parks J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 729-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Finally, acute, partial repletion of hepatic ABCA1 expression with adenovirus resulted in normalization of plasma VLDL TG concentration (Fig. 7, B and F). These results collectively suggest a mechanistic link between nascent HDL formed by ABCA1 and hepatic VLDL TG secretion.The mechanism responsible for ABCA1-mediated regulation of VLDL assembly and secretion appears to involve a PI3K-dependent pathway based on multiple lines of evidence. First, HSKO mice demonstrated attenuated phosphorylation of hepatic PI3K p85 and its downstream target, Akt, in response to both acute injection of insulin- and glucose-stimulated endogenous insulin release (i.e. fasting-refeeding; Fig. 5, A and B). Second, diminished PI3K activation was observed in cultured primary hepatocytes from HSKO mice in conjunction with increased TG secretion (Fig. 5D). Third, plasma TG concentrations of WT mice were elevated to levels similar to those of HSKO mice after acute in vivo inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin (Fig. 5C). Finally, partial adenoviral repletion of hepatic ABCA1 rescued PI3K activation and normalized plasma TG concentrations (Fig. 7, A and F). These results, along with our previous in vitro data (12Chung S. Gebre A.K. Seo J. Shelness G.S. Parks J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 729-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), firmly establish a mechanistic link through which hepatic ABCA1 expression regulates hepatic PI3K activity, hepatic TG secretion, and plasma TG concentration.The relationship between VLDL particle assembly and PI3K has been noted previously and, in part, underlies the ability of insulin to acutely regulate hepatic VLDL TG output (28Brown A.M.

The interface between PI3K-dependent signaling and apoB assembly and secretion is not known in detail, although in some studies, insulin-mediated signaling, via PI3K and Akt, regulates MTP expression and, hence, VLDL particle number and size (18Chirieac D.V.

Invest. 2008; 118: 2347-2364PubMed Google Scholar), MTP expression was unaffected by ABCA1 deficiency in this study (Fig. 4E) or by silencing of ABCA1 in rat hepatoma cells in our previous study (12Chung S. Gebre A.K. Seo J. Shelness G.S. Parks J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 729-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that other mechanisms are operational.VLDL particle assembly occurs in two steps: the co-translational lipidation of apoB by MTP to form a small, dense apoB-containing pre-VLDL, followed by a pre-VLDL particle fusion with TG lipid droplets in the secretory pathway to form mature VLDL particles (33Gusarova V.

Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that the insulin/PI3K effects on VLDL production occur during the second, pre-VLDL enlargement step of particle assembly (28Brown A.M. Gibbons G.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1656-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30Sparks J.D. Phung T.L. Bolognino M. Sparks C.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The current studies demonstrate that VLDL from HSKO mice is more buoyant and of larger diameter than that of WT mice, which is also consistent with ABCA1/PI3K exerting effects during the second step of VLDL assembly. Because PI3K is present in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, is involved in intracellular vesicular trafficking, and is increased with insulin stimulation (29Phung T.L. Roncone A. Jensen K.L.

EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that the lack of ABCA1 in hepatocytes and the resultant attenuation of PI3K activation results in slower VLDL transit through the secretory pathway, allowing additional time for second step VLDL particle expansion. This hypothesis is supported by the observations of defective lipid and vesicular trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane in fibroblasts from TD subjects (37Orsó E. Broccardo C. Kaminski W.E. Böttcher A. Liebisch G. Drobnik W. Götz A. Chambenoit O. Diederich W. Langmann T. Spruss T. Luciani M.F. Rothe G. Lackner K.J. Chimini G. Schmitz G. Nat.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10002-10005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Reduced LPL activity has also been suggested to explain the elevated TG levels in TD subjects. For example, Wang et al. (10Wang C.S. Alaupovic P. Gregg R.E. Brewer Jr., H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 920: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that VLDL from TD subjects was enriched with apoA-II and apoC-III, compared with VLDL from normolipidemic subjects, resulting in a reduced lipase accessibility. Consistent with this notion, Kyreos et al. (41Kypreos K.E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10491-10502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) recently showed that adenoviral overexpression of human apoC-III in apoE KO and ABCA1 KO mice induces hypertriglyceridemia due to low LPL reactivity of apoC-III-enriched VLDL. In addition to possible effects on VLDL substrate, our mouse model also showed that both HL and LPL were markedly reduced upon deletion of hepatic ABCA1 (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it is likely that the decrease in HL and LPL in HSKO mice contributed, in large part, to the increase in plasma TG and apoB48 levels observed in the postprandial state (Figs. 1, B and C, and 2D). These findings may explain why elevated plasma TG levels in TD patients are more evident postprandially (9Kolovou G. Daskalova D. Anagnostopoulou K. Hoursalas I. Voudris V. Mikhailidis D.P. Cokkinos D.V. J. Clin. Pathol. 2003; 56: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Despite elevated plasma TG concentrations, TD subjects have LDL concentrations that are reduced by ∼40–50% (8Clee S.M.

Atherosclerosis. 2001; 159: 231-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this was due to a 2-fold increase in FCR of LDL. Supporting this finding, Zha et al. (43Zha X. Genest Jr., J. McPherson R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39476-39483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported enhanced uptake of LDL by fibroblasts from TD subjects that appeared related to increased endocytosis. Similar to TD subjects, HSKO mice demonstrated a 2-fold increased removal rate of LDL tracer from plasma compared with WT mice (Fig. 6A). The increased catabolism of LDL probably resulted from the 2.5-fold increase in expression (mRNA and protein) of hepatic LDLr (Fig. 6, B and C). The increase in hepatic LDLr expression in HSKO mice appears unrelated to hepatic sterol content, because chow-fed WT and HSKO mice had similar hepatic lipid content and expression of cholesterol-sensitive genes (supplemental Fig. 1A). Additional evidence to support our conclusion that increased hepatic LDLr expression is responsible for the decreased plasma LDL concentrations in HSKO mice comes from our studies in which HSKO mice were crossed into the LDLrKO background. In the absence of whole-body LDLr expression, we observed similar plasma LDL concentrations in LDLrKO and HSKO-LDLrKO mice (Fig. 6F), although plasma TG concentrations were still significantly higher in HSKO-LDLrKO mice relative to LDLrKO mice. These results suggest that two separate mechanisms, increased hepatic LDLr expression and increased hepatic TG secretion, are responsible for the reduced plasma LDL and increased plasma TG concentrations, observed under conditions of hepatic ABCA1 expression deficiency.Transgenic LDLrKO mice with 2.3-fold overexpression of ABCA1 protein in the liver displayed significantly increased plasma VLDL, LDL, and HDL cholesterol concentrations, increased apoA-I and apoB levels, delayed clearance of VLDL and LDL tracers, and an increase in atherosclerosis (44Joyce C.W. Wagner E.M. Basso F. Amar M.J. Freeman L.A. Shamburek R.D. Knapper C.L. Syed J. Wu J. Vaisman B.L. Fruchart-Najib J. Billings E.M. Paigen B. Remaley A.T. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol.

These data led to the hypothesis that liver ABCA1 may play a proatherogenic role in vivo, resulting from its dramatic effects on the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins. These mice also displayed increased plasma TG concentrations, perhaps due to a small but significantly delayed clearance of plasma VLDL particles caused by their cholesterol enrichment. However, a more modest overexpression of ABCA1 protein (∼25%) using the endogenous ABCA1 promoter in LDLrKO mice resulted in no significant increase in apoB-containing lipoprotein concentration and a significant reduction in atherosclerosis, probably due to an increase in macrophage ABCA1 protein expression (45Brunham L.R. Singaraja R.R. Duong M. Timmins J.M. Fievet C. Bissada N. Kang M.H. Samra A. Fruchart J.C. McManus B. Staels B. Parks J.S. Hayden M.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The reasons for the apparently discrepant impact of ABCA1 overexpression on LDL concentrations and atherosclerosis in LDLrKO mice are 2-fold. First, the regulatory elements controlling the sites and regulation of ABCA1 expression were different in the two studies. Second, the extent of ABCA1 overexpression was ∼10-fold higher when the apoE promoter was used (∼2.5-fold over expression) versus the endogenous ABCA1 promoter (0.25-fold increase). Indeed, when a 2.6-fold overexpression of ABCA1 was achieved in the liver using a cytomegalovirus promoter in adenovirus, significant increases in the concentration of plasma proatherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins as well as HDL cholesterol were observed (22Wellington C.L. Brunham L.R. Zhou S. Singaraja R.R. Visscher H. Gelfer A. Ross C. James E. Liu G. Huber M.T. Yang Y.Z. Parks R.J. Groen A. Fruchart-Najib J. Hayden M.R. J.

Taken together, these studies complement our data and demonstrate that when hepatic ABCA1 is overexpressed to a sufficient extent, LDL concentrations are elevated, whereas liver-specific deletion of ABCA1 results in reduced plasma LDL concentrations.In summary, our data support an important and emerging role for hepatic ABCA1 expression in the production and catabolism of apoB lipoproteins and suggest new mechanisms to account for the increased plasma TG and decreased LDL concentrations observed in TD subjects. Furthermore, the decreased LDL levels may explain why some TD subjects have only minimally increased risk of coronary heart disease despite having extremely low plasma HDL levels (4Assman G. von Eckardstein A.

https://openalex.org/W2018866580,"In Drosophila, naked cuticle is an inducible antagonist of the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway, likely acting at the level of Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl), an essential component of this pathway. The mechanism by which naked cuticle and its two vertebrate orthologs, Naked1 (NKD1) and Naked2 (NKD2), inhibit Dvl function is unknown. NKD2 is myristoylated, a co-translational modification that leads to its plasma membrane localization. In contrast, myristoylation-deficient G2A NKD2 is cytoplasmic. Herein we show that the ability of Nkd2/NKD2 to antagonize Wnt-beta-catenin activity during zebrafish embryonic development and in mammalian HEK293 cells is myristoylation-dependent. NKD2 and Dvl-1 interact and co-localize at the lateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells. In reciprocal overexpression and siRNA knockdown experiments, NKD2 and Dvl-1 destabilize each other via enhanced polyubiquitylation; this effect is also dependent upon Naked2 myristoylation. Cell fractionation and ubiquitylation assays indicate that endogenous NKD2 interacts with a slower migrating, ubiquitylated form of Dvl-1 in plasma membrane fractions. These results provide a mechanism by which NKD2 antagonizes Wnt signaling: myristoylated NKD2 interacts with Dvl-1 at the plasma membrane, and this interaction leads to their mutual ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation."

The biochemistry of lycopene cyclization has been enigmatic, as the previously proposed acid-base catalysis conflicted with the possibility of redox catalysis as predicted by the presence of a dinucleotide binding site. We show that reduced FAD is the essential lycopene cyclase (CrtY) cofactor. Using flavin analogs, mass spectrometry, and mutagenesis, evidence was obtained based on which a catalytic mechanism relying on cryptic (net) electron transfer can be refuted. The role of reduced FAD is proposed to reside in the stabilization of a transition state carrying a (partial) positive charge or of a positively charged intermediate via a charge transfer interaction, acid-base catalysis serving as the underlying catalytic principle. Lycopene cyclase, thus, ranks among the novel class of non-redox flavoproteins, such as isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase type 2 (IDI-2) that requires the reduced form of the cofactor."

Human CMBL, whose endogenous function has still not been reported, is a human homolog of Pseudomonas dienelactone hydrolase involved in the bacterial halocatechol degradation pathway. The ubiquitous expression of human CMBL gene transcript in various tissues was observed. The recombinant human CMBL expressed in mammalian cells was clearly shown to activate OM. By comparing the enzyme kinetics and chemical inhibition properties between the recombinant protein and human tissue preparations, CMBL was demonstrated to be the primary OM bioactivating enzyme in the liver and intestine. The recombinant CMBL also converted other prodrugs having the same ester structure as OM, faropenem medoxomil and lenampicillin, to their active metabolites. CMBL exhibited a unique sensitivity to chemical inhibitors, thus, being distinguishable from other known esterases. Site-directed mutagenesis on the putative active residue Cys132 of the recombinant CMBL caused a drastic reduction of the OM-hydrolyzing activity. We report for the first time that CMBL serves as a key enzyme in the bioactivation of OM, hydrolyzing the ester bond of the prodrug type xenobiotics."
https://openalex.org/W1973824222,"Ticks are blood-feeding arthropods that may secrete immunosuppressant molecules, which inhibit host inflammatory and immune responses and provide survival advantages to pathogens at tick bleeding sites in hosts. In the current work, two families of immunoregulatory peptides, hyalomin-A and -B, were first identified from salivary glands of hard tick <i>Hyalomma asiaticum asiaticum</i>. Three copies of hyalomin-A are encoded by an identical gene and released from the same protein precursor. Both hyalomin-A and -B can exert significant anti-inflammatory functions, either by directly inhibiting host secretion of inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemotectic protein-1, and interferon-γ or by indirectly increasing the secretion of immunosuppressant cytokine of interleukin-10. Hyalomin-A and -B were both found to potently scavenge free radical <i>in vitro</i> in a rapid manner and inhibited adjuvant-induced inflammation in mouse models <i>in vivo</i>. The JNK/SAPK subgroup of the MAPK signaling pathway was involved in such immunoregulatory functions of hyalomin-A and -B. These results showed that immunoregulatory peptides of tick salivary glands suppress host inflammatory response by modulating cytokine secretion and detoxifying reactive oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W2041895857,"The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) tumor suppressor is a phosphatase that inhibits phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent signaling by metabolizing the phosphoinositide lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3) at the plasma membrane. PTEN can be mono- or polyubiquitinated, and this appears to control its nuclear localization and stability, respectively. Although PTEN phosphorylation at a cluster of C-terminal serine and threonine residues has been shown to stabilize the protein and inhibit polyubiquitination and plasma membrane localization, details of the regulation of ubiquitination are unclear. Here, we show that plasma membrane targeting of PTEN greatly enhances PTEN ubiquitination and that phosphorylation of PTEN in vitro does not affect subsequent ubiquitination. These data suggest that C-terminal phosphorylation indirectly regulates ubiquitination by controlling membrane localization. We also show that either mono- or polyubiquitination in vitro greatly reduces PTEN phosphatase activity. Finally, we show that hyperosmotic stress increases both PTEN ubiquitination and cellular PtdInsP3 levels well before a reduction in PTEN protein levels is observed. Both PTEN ubiquitination and elevated PtdInsP3 levels were reduced within 10 min after removal of the hyperosmotic stress. Our data indicate that ubiquitination may represent a regulated mechanism of direct reversible control over the PTEN enzyme.

Here, we investigate the link between PTEN phosphorylation and ubiquitination and analyze the effects of ubiquitination on PTEN enzyme activity. U87MG glioblastoma cells and HEK293T cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures and maintained in the recommended medium (10% fetal bovine serum). Standard cell culture medium, additives, and sera were from Invitrogen. Transfection of U87MG cells was performed using TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus) when U87MG cells were ∼50% confluent. Plasmids encoding PTEN, the PTEN A3 mutant (S380A/T382A/T383A), or the myristoylated PTEN construct and/or FLAG-tagged ubiquitin were used in transfection as indicated. After transfection, cells were treated with or without inhibitor(s) for the indicated times. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed. The following agents were purchased from Calbiochem: proteasome inhibitor I (PSI), calpeptin, and the CK2 inhibitors DMAT and 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole. The specificity of these inhibitors has been studied previously and described (21Ostrowska H. Wójcik C. Wilk S. Omura S. Kozlowski L. Stoklosa T. Worowski K. Radziwon P. Int. J. Biochem.

Mammalian expression vectors for untagged PTEN were originally generated by cloning the PTEN cDNA from pCR2.1-TOPO-PTEN (24Leslie N.R. Gray A. Pass I. Orchiston E.A. Downes C.P. Biochem.

A mammalian expression vector for FLAG-ubiquitin was kindly provided by Philip Cohen (University of Dundee). A bacterial expression vector for the E3 ligase NEDD4-1 was produced as follows. The 5′-end of NEDD4-1 was amplified from I.M.A.G.E. expressed sequence tag 5575951 (Geneservice) using Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) and primers NEDD4 F1 (5′-AAAAGAATTCATGGCAACTTGCGCGGTGGAGGTGTTCGGG) and NEDD4 R1 (5′-TGTTCCCTCCAGTCATTCACATCAACATCTCCCAGTCCACACATAAG). The remaining 3′-end was cloned by PCR from I.M.A.G.E. expressed sequence tag 6138012 using primers NEDD4 F2 (5′-GTGTGGACTGGGAGATGTTGATGTGAATGACTGGAGGGAAC) and NEDD4 R2 (5′-TTTTCTCGAGCTAATCAACTCCATCAAAGCCCTGGGTGTTTTCAATTGCCATCTGA). The full-length PCR fragment was assembled and cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced to completion. Full-length NEDD4-1 was subsequently excised using EcoRI and XhoI and inserted into pGEX6P-1. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride) containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using precast 4–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Polyscreen, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Most reagents for electrophoresis and blotting were purchased from Invitrogen, and standard manufacturers' protocols were followed. Mouse anti-PTEN monoclonal antibody (clone A2B1) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies to phospho-Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 PTEN and phospho-Ser380 PTEN were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Anti-FLAG antibody M2 and β-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma. Whole cell extracts were prepared using lysis buffer containing fresh 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma). PTEN was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibody A2B1 precoupled with agarose beads. The proteins bound to beads were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) for 10 min. The samples were then resolved by 4–12% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody M2 or anti-PTEN antibody, either mouse monoclonal A2B1 or goat polyclonal N19 (Santa Cruz biotechnology). In vitro ubiquitin assays were carried out at 30 °C for 1 h in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 100 μm ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), 0.05 μm His6-UBE1, 1 μm GST-UbcH5b, 1 μm NEDD4-1, and 500 ng of PTEN recombinant protein). The reaction was terminated by the addition of lithium dodecyl sulfate sample loading buffer (Invitrogen) and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, boiling for 10 min, and running the samples on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The measurement of PTEN activity after in vitro ubiquitination was performed as follows. In vitro ubiquitin assays were carried out at 30 °C for 1 h in ubiquitination buffer, and then PTEN was immunoprecipitated using anti-PTEN monoclonal antibody A2B1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and washed twice with reaction/wash buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) before PTEN assays were performed on the immune complexes. Control immunoprecipitations and phosphatase assays were performed using sham-ubiquitinated PTEN that had been treated in parallel with one component of the ubiquitination assay omitted. Purified His6-UBE1 (human) expressed in insect cells and bacterially expressed GST-UbcH5b (human) were provided by James Hastie and Hilary McLauchlan (Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, University of Dundee). The preparation of 3-33P-labeled phosphoinositide lipid substrates, the expression and purification of GST-PTEN, the removal of the GST tag, and the further purification of untagged PTEN have been described previously (42McConnachie G. Pass I. Walker S.M. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The production of the phosphorylated peptide polymer [33P]poly(Glu-Tyr) with insulin receptor kinase has also been described previously (26Leslie N.R. Yang X. Downes C.P. Weijer C.J. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Except where noted, PtdInsP3 assays were performed using substrate vesicles prepared by sonication of 100 μm phosphatidylcholine, 10 μm phosphatidylinositol 4,5-trisphosphate, 10 nm unlabeled PtdInsP3, and 100,000 dpm [3-33P]PtdInsP3. These were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol with washed immunoprecipitates for 1 h at 30 °C. Poly(Glu-Tyr(P)) phosphatase assays were conducted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol with 500 ng of enzyme and 100,000 dpm (∼1 μg) phosphorylated substrate per assay also at 30 °C for 1 h. Reactions were terminated directly by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold 1 m perchloric acid and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, left on ice for 30 min, and spun at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and ammonium molybdate was added to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. After extraction with 2 volumes of 1:1 (v/v) toluene/isobutyl alcohol, the upper phase was removed, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. PTEN was phosphorylated using purified CK2 following previous protocols (27Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar, 28Maccario H. Perera N.M. Davidson L. Downes C.P. Leslie N.R. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). U87MG cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding PTEN and then, 24 h after transduction, washed and incubated for 1 h in methionine/cysteine-free medium containing 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (70 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. After three washes with complete culture medium without label, cells were incubated in more culture medium and chased for different times before lysis. PTEN proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The labeled PTEN present at each time point was quantified using a Fuji FLA-2000 phosphorimager and AIDA software. To better understand the role of ubiquitination in regulating PTEN function, we established assays for PTEN ubiquitination in cells and in vitro. These cell-based experiments were performed using the PTEN-null glioblastoma cell line U87MG, coexpressing recombinant PTEN with FLAG epitope-tagged ubiquitin. In these cells, only when both PTEN and FLAG-ubiquitin were coexpressed was a smear of high molecular weight polyubiquitinated PTEN observed when PTEN immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-FLAG antibody (Figs. 1A and 2B). Similar results were obtained when anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was followed by anti-PTEN Western blotting (data not shown). This apparent polyubiquitinated protein accumulated when cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor for 2 or 24 h, correlating with the increased abundance of PTEN protein caused by similar treatment for 24 h (Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1) and in accordance with previous data (13Tolkacheva T.

PTEN levels were not affected by cellular treatment with calpeptin, an inhibitor of calpain proteases. Initially, we chose to use this system to investigate the details of the connection between C-terminal phosphorylation and ubiquitination. PTEN can be stabilized by phosphorylation of a cluster of serine and threonine residues by the kinase CK2, correlating with reduced polyubiquitination (13Tolkacheva T. Boddapati M. Sanfiz A.

In agreement with this model, treatment of U87MG cells expressing wild-type PTEN with well validated selective inhibitors of CK2, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole and DMAT (22Pagano M.A. Andrzejewska M. Ruzzene M. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Bain J. Elliott M. Meggio F. Kazimierczuk Z. Pinna L.A. J. Med.

Similarly, blocking C-terminal phosphorylation by mutation of three residues in this cluster of serine and threonine residues to alanine (PTEN A3) led to a marked destabilization of PTEN in amino acid pulse-chase labeling experiments (Fig. 2A). This mutant protein was also stabilized by treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 2B), and when the ubiquitination of PTEN A3 was analyzed, enhanced ubiquitination of this mutant relative to the wild-type protein was observed (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Mutation of the PTEN C-terminal phosphorylation sites reduces PTEN stability and enhances ubiquitination. A, the cellular stability of the wild-type PTEN (PTEN WT) and PTEN A3 (S380A/T382A/T383A) proteins was analyzed by metabolic 35S-amino acid labeling of PTEN-null U87MG cells transduced with viruses encoding either wild-type PTEN or PTEN A3 and chasing with unlabeled amino acid-containing growth medium for the indicated times. PTEN proteins were visualized by autoradiography after immunoprecipitation. B, U87MG cells transiently expressing PTEN A3 were treated as indicated for 24 h with either 10 μm PSI or 10 μm calpeptin before Western blotting for PTEN expression along with a β-actin control. C, the ubiquitination of wild-type PTEN and PTEN A3 was compared in U87MG cells. U87MG cells were transfected with vectors encoding FLAG-tagged ubiquitin and either wild-type PTEN or PTEN A3 24 h before cells were treated with PSI at 10 μm for 2 h. Cells were lysed, and PTEN was immunoprecipitated (IP) before Western blotting (W.blot) these immunoprecipitates and the lysates with antibodies raised against the FLAG epitope, PTEN, and β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been shown that mutation of the C-terminal phosphorylation sites of PTEN, including work with the PTEN A3 mutant, leads to enhanced plasma membrane localization (31Das S.

This leaves a question as to whether phosphorylation inhibits ubiquitination directly through this conformational change or perhaps indirectly through, for example, inhibiting the co-localization of PTEN with a plasma membrane-localized ubiquitin ligase. To test this latter hypothesis, we analyzed the ubiquitination of PTEN proteins artificially targeted to the plasma membrane by the addition of the N-terminal myristoylation/palmitoylation signal from Lck (25Leslie N.R. Bennett D. Gray A. Pass I. Hoang-Xuan K. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 36McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3771-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Both wild-type and phosphatase-dead PTEN proteins were ubiquitinated to a far greater level when myristoylated compared with their corresponding non-myristoylated proteins (Fig. 3A) despite being C-terminally phosphorylated to a similar degree (Fig. 3B). The N-terminal myristoylation signal contains no lysine residues, and similar results were obtained using two different myristoylated PTEN expression constructs with different linker regions, one of which has no additional lysine residues other than those in PTEN. We then chose to directly address the effect of phosphorylation on ubiquitination in vitro (Fig. 4). Recombinant purified PTEN was first phosphorylated with purified CK2 and immunoprecipitated before being ubiquitinated in vitro (Fig. 4A). In vitro phosphorylation of PTEN with CK2 consistently achieved a stoichiometry of >3 and often approaching 4. Ubiquitination used recombinant purified Ubc5Hb and NEDD4-1 as the ubiquitin E2 and E3 components, respectively. In these experiments, we used both purified untagged ubiquitin and a mutant in which each lysine residue within ubiquitin is mutated to arginine (referred to as “ubiquitin K all R”) to block the formation of polyubiquitin chains. Phosphorylation had little or no inhibitory effect on subsequent ubiquitination, with some experiments with wild-type ubiquitin showing an increase in high molecular weight polyubiquitination relative to unphosphorylated PTEN (Fig. 4, B and C). Next, we were able to use the in vitro ubiquitination assay to analyze the effects of ubiquitination on PTEN catalytic activity. PTEN has been described to be both polyubiquitinated and monoubiquitinated (17Trotman L.C. Wang X. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Teruya-Feldstein J. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Carver B.S. Cordon-Cardo C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Chi S.G. Kim H.J. Misteli T. Jiang X. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2007; 128: 141-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Therefore, we addressed the effects of monoubiquitination by performing ubiquitination in vitro using the ubiquitin K all R mutant, with each lysine residue replaced by arginine, blocking the formation of polyubiquitin chains (represented in Fig. 5A). Experimentally, ubiquitin K all R led to an apparent block in the polyubiquitination of PTEN, with a range of molecular weights being evident that presumably correspond to monoubiquitination and multisite monoubiquitination (Fig. 5B). Purified PTEN was put through this in vitro ubiquitination reaction in parallel with control samples, in which ubiquitin was omitted from the incubation. PTEN was then immunoprecipitated, washed, and assayed against both PtdInsP3 lipid vesicles and the peptide polymer substrate poly(Glu-Tyr(P)), with, in each case, greatly reduced activity being observed with ubiquitinated PTEN relative to a sham-ubiquitinated control (Fig. 5, C and D). Similarly, when the PTEN product of the monoubiquitination assay was immunoprecipitated and assayed, it was also found to show a similar loss of activity to polyubiquitination, suggesting that either mono- or polyubiquitination may greatly inhibit PTEN activity. In this case, although the mean activity against both substrates was reduced, this difference achieved statistical significance only using the lipid substrate (Fig. 5D). Given the incomplete reaction in the ubiquitination assay and that, in this series of experiments, the degree of ubiquitination appeared to correlate closely with the degree of PTEN activity loss, this suggests that the ubiquitination of PTEN in these experiments must lead to almost complete inactivation. Western blotting of both the completed crude ubiquitination assay and the subsequent PTEN immunoprecipitates demonstrated that the ubiquitination procedure did not affect the efficiency of PTEN immunoprecipitation (supplemental Fig. S2). Finally, we wanted to test the hypothesis that ubiquitination directly inactivates PTEN catalytic activity in cell-based experiments. Previous experiments in our laboratory had shown that treatment of HEK293T cells with hyperosmotic stress led to a reduction in PTEN expression levels over a period of several hours (Fig. 6 and data not shown). Therefore, we analyzed the ubiquitination of PTEN in HEK293T cells treated with 0.5 m sorbitol. We found that hyperosmotic stress rapidly increased PTEN polyubiquitination (Fig. 6A). This treatment also led to a modest decrease in PTEN protein levels, ∼50% reduction in 4 h (Fig. 6, A–C), which could be blocked by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 6B). The phosphorylation of the downstream PtdInsP3-regulated kinase Akt could not be used as an indicator of the cellular PtdInsP3 level in this case, as hyperosmotic stress appeared to block the activation of Akt (Fig. 6C), as described in a previous study despite a reported increase in the cellular PtdInsP3 level (37Meier R. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used direct measurements of PtdInsP3 levels in these cells as a readout of PTEN activity. Sorbitol treatment of HEK293T cells caused cellular PtdInsP3 levels to increase rapidly (Fig. 6C), correlating with the stimulated ubiquitination, long before effects on PTEN expression level became evident. In these experiments, sorbitol stimulation led to an increase in the activating phosphorylation of the recognized hyperosmotically responsive kinase p38 MAPK at Thr180/Tyr182 but did not affect the phosphorylation of PTEN at Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, both PTEN ubiquitination and cellular PtdInsP3 levels were reduced within 10 min if cells were returned to normal medium after 1 h of sorbitol treatment (Fig. 6, D and E). These data support a direct connection between PTEN ubiquitination, cellular PTEN activity, and cellular PtdInsP3 levels. Our data support two novel conclusions. First, PTEN ubiquitination directly inhibits its phosphatase activity. Second, PTEN ubiquitination is greatly enhanced by hyperosmotic stress and membrane localization, and this latter indirect mechanism is how C-terminal phosphorylation controls PTEN ubiquitination. Several previous studies have established that C-terminal phosphorylation of PTEN increases the stability of the enzyme and reduces polyubiquitination (13Tolkacheva T. Boddapati M. Sanfiz A. Tsuchida K. Kimmelman A.C. Chan A.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4985-4989PubMed Google Scholar, 14Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Our data here indicate that a dominant mechanism by which this effect is mediated is indirectly via the recognized effect of phosphorylation in suppressing PTEN localization at the plasma membrane (31Das S. Dixon J.E. Cho W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7491-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 32Vazquez F. Matsuoka S. Sellers W.R. Yanagida T. Ueda M. Devreotes P.N. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48627-48630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that the phosphorylated PTEN C terminus inhibits ubiquitination in cells and in vitro by NEDD4-1 (38Wang X. Shi Y. Wang J. Huang G. Jiang X. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because the phosphorylated C terminus inhibits membrane binding of PTEN (31Das S. Dixon J.E. Cho W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7491-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), these cellular data seem consistent with our conclusions. The reported effects of PTEN C-terminal deletion on ubiquitination in vitro appear to us far less strong than those in cells (38Wang X. Shi Y. Wang J. Huang G. Jiang X. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). From this we conclude that although both mechanisms may apply, the direct enhancement of ubiquitination in vitro caused by deletion of the C-terminal tail is weaker than the effect of membrane localization in cells. Recent data indicate that the regulation of PTEN via ubiquitination is complex. Both mono- and polyubiquitination appear to have separable effects on PTEN function, with mono- and polyubiquitination targeting PTEN for nuclear localization and proteasomal degradation, respectively (11Wang X. Trotman L.C. Koppie T. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Gao Z. Wang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Jiang X.

Nature. 2008; 455: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Although NEDD4-1 has been identified as an E3 ligase capable of controlling PTEN abundance in several cultured cells (11Wang X. Trotman L.C. Koppie T. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Gao Z. Wang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Jiang X. Cell. 2007; 128: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), subsequent data suggest that this may not be a universal effect and that other E3 ligases may exist, such as XIAP (19Fouladkou F. Landry T. Kawabe H. Neeb A. Lu C. Brose N. Stambolic V. Rotin D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8585-8590Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Van Themsche C. Leblanc V. Parent S. Asselin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20462-20466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Additionally, other proteins implicated in ubiquitin-dependent signaling have been identified as PTEN-interacting proteins, including the NEDD4-related proteins WWP2 and UbcH7 (39Crockett D.K. Fillmore G.C. Elenitoba-Johnson K.S. Lim M.S. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 1250-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 40Waite K.A. Eng C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that ubiquitination inhibits PTEN activity implies that, if PTEN is polyubiquitinated and targeted for degradation, it is far less active once ubiquitinated even before it is degraded by the proteasome. Because our data suggest that this ubiquitination may occur at the plasma membrane, where the lipid substrate for PTEN is found, they also favor the speculation that ubiquitination may act as a mechanism to control PTEN activity. Ubiquitination is well recognized as a reversible modification, and the identification of HAUSP/USP7 as a PTEN-deubiquitinating enzyme supports this model for PTEN (18Song M.S. Salmena L. Carracedo A. Egia A. Lo-Coco F. Teruya-Feldstein J. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2008; 455: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The regulated inactivation of PTEN would appear significant whether PTEN is polyubiquitinated and targeted for degradation or monoubiquitinated either for targeting to the nucleus or simply as a mechanism of reversible inactivation at other cellular locations. In summary, our data imply that PTEN ubiquitination occurs at the plasma membrane or at least is indirectly enhanced by PTEN membrane localization and that either mono- or polyubiquitination inhibits PTEN catalytic activity. These findings raise the possibility that PTEN ubiquitination may be driven by extracellular stimuli and may be a mechanism of reversible control over the enzyme during hyperosmotic stress and other conditions. Given the emerging complexity of mechanisms controlling PTEN ubiquitination, this seems likely to have significant implications for future functional studies.

SmcR, a homologue of Vibrio harveyi LuxR, has been proposed as a quorum-sensing master regulator of Vibrio vulnificus, an opportunistic human pathogen. Previous studies demonstrated that SmcR is essential for the survival and pathogenesis of V. vulnificus, indicating that inhibiting SmcR is an attractive approach to combat infections by the bacteria. Here, we determined the crystal structure of SmcR at 2.1 Å resolution. The protein structure reveals a typical TetR superfamily fold consisting of an N-terminal DNA binding domain and a C-terminal dimerization domain. In vivo and in vitro functional analysis of the dimerization domain suggested that dimerization of SmcR is vital for its biological regulatory function. The N-terminal DNA recognition and binding residues were assigned based on the protein structure and the results of in vivo and in vitro mutagenesis experiments. Furthermore, protein-DNA interaction experiments suggested that SmcR may have a sophisticated mechanism that enables the protein to recognize each of its many target operators with different affinities.

Many bacterial societies are based on chemical communication called quorum sensing. This process facilitates social networking in bacteria in response to environmental challenges that trigger alterations in gene expression or repression that are often critical for survival (1Bassler B.L. Losick R. Cell. 2006; 125: 237-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Such “social behavior” results from the bacteria sensing and responding to fluctuations in the cell population, mediated by diffusible signaling molecules (often referred to as autoinducers, or AIs) that are synthesized within the bacterial cell. The cell density-dependent regulation of bioluminescence in Vibrio harveyi is frequently used as a model for quorum sensing. The V. harveyi LuxR protein is the transcriptional activator of the luminescence operon, and its synthesis is controlled by the levels of three autoinducers, HAI-1, AI-2, and CAI-1, which are synthesized and detected by the LuxM/N, LuxS/PQ, and CqsA/S two-component signal transduction-resembling systems, respectively (2Waters C.M. Bassler B.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 319-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar, 3Ng W.L. Bassler B.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 197-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Homologues of LuxR, which controls expression of the genes involved in the quorum-sensing regulon, have been identified in various pathogenic Vibrio species (spp.). The quorum-sensing system of the opportunistic human pathogen Vibrio vulnificus has been little studied (4Milton D.L. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2006; 296: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has indicated that the bacterium produces a signaling molecule, N-butanoyl-homoserine-lactone (C4-HSL), but the genes related to the signaling molecule seem to be different from those found in other Gram-negative bacteria (5Valiente E. Bruhn J.B. Nielsen K.F. Larsen J.L. Roig F.J. Gram L. Amaro C. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 2009; 69: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It was also predicted that V. vulnificus does not use the CqsA/S system. However, the bacterium has been known to express the LuxS/PQ, LuxU, LuxO, and key transcriptional regulator, LuxR, homologues, suggesting that one of the quorum-sensing systems in V. vulnificus is similar to the LuxS/PQ system in V. harveyi (4Milton D.L. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2006; 296: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 6Kim S.Y. Lee S.E. Kim Y.R. Kim C.M. Ryu P.Y. Choy H.E. Chung S.S. Rhee J.H. Mol.

Many studies have demonstrated that SmcR regulates virulence genes and adaptive phenotypes (9Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45072-45081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10McDougald D. Rice S.A. Kjelleberg S. J.

In addition, a recent study based on a genome-wide search for DNA targets of SmcR suggested that at least 121 genes are under the control of this master regulator (12Lee D.H. Jeong H.S. Jeong H.G. Kim K.M. Kim H. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23610-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Alignment of the DNA target sequences revealed a 22-bp consensus SmcR-binding sequence with a pseudo-2-fold symmetry pattern. The consensus sequence consists of an 8-bp inverted repeat, with a well conserved left half and a less well conserved right half. This result was comparable with the results of another genome-wide search, which showed that the V. harveyi LuxR recognizes a 21-bp consensus operator sequence with dyad symmetry (13Pompeani A.J. Irgon J.J. Berger M.F. Bulyk M.L. Wingreen N.S. Bassler B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The operator region (PvvpE) for transcription of the virulence factor gene, vvpE, has been extensively studied as a site regulated by SmcR in V. vulnificus (9Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 23610-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The binding of SmcR to PvvpE induces the expression of vvpE, which encodes an elastolytic protease known to be associated with pathogenesis. The binding site was determined using a DNA footprinting technique, and the binding sequence showed a similar 22-bp consensus sequence pattern but with less well conserved sequences in the inverted repeat right half. Introducing the SmcR-recognition consensus sequence of the right half of the inverted repeat into the right half of PvvpE resulted in much higher binding affinity (12Lee D.H. Jeong H.S. Jeong H.G. Kim K.M. Kim H. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23610-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Such observations of the transcriptional regulation of SmcR have provided instructive information; however, the molecular details of the regulatory mechanisms of SmcR in V. vulnificus remain unclear. Recently, the structure of the Vibrio cholerae LuxR homologue protein, HapR, was determined, although the relationship between its structure and biological function remains to be fully investigated (14De Silva R.S. Kovacikova G. Lin W. Taylor R.K. Skorupski K. Kull F.J. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to obtain molecular details of the regulatory mechanisms of SmcR in V. vulnificus based on its three-dimensional protein structure. Accordingly, the crystal structure of SmcR was determined at 2.1 Å resolution. On the basis of the crystal structure and supporting mutagenesis data in vivo and in vitro, we describe molecular insights into the transcriptional regulation mediated by SmcR. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium or on LB containing 1.5% (w/v) agar at 37 °C. Unless mentioned otherwise, V. vulnificus strains were grown aerobically in LB medium supplemented with 2.0% (w/v) NaCl (LBS) at 30 °C. When required, antibiotics were added to the media as follows: 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μg/ml kanamycin for both E. coli and V. vulnificus; 20 and 3 μg/ml chloramphenicol for E. coli and V. vulnificus, respectively; 10 and 3 μg/ml tetracycline for E. coli and V. vulnificus, respectively; and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin for E. coli. The oligonucleotides used are listed in supplemental Table S2. E. coli SM10λpir was used as a conjugal donor to transfer the broad host range vector, pJH0311 (15Goo S.Y. Lee H.J. Kim W.H. Han K.L.

The smcR gene, encoding the transcriptional regulator SmcR protein, was amplified from the plasmid, pHS103 (9Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol.

The PCR product was then subcloned into the pHis-Parallel1 vector (16Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), a hexahistidine-tagged protein expression vector containing a recombinant tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site, to produce the plasmid pHis-smcR. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring the plasmid were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin at 37 °C until they reached an A600 of between 0.6 and 0.8. After being cooled to 25 °C, smcR expression was induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 14 h. The expressed protein was then purified according to a previously described procedure (17Kim M.H. Kim Y. Park H.J. Lee J.S. Kwak S.N. Jung W.H. Lee S.G. Kim D. Lee Y.C. Oh T.K. J. Biol.

Crystallization trials were carried out using the sitting-drop technique at 21 °C. An initial SmcR crystal was produced under the following conditions: 0.2 m Li2SO4, 10% PEG 3000, and 0.1 m imidazole, pH 8.0.

Because the SeMet crystals diffracted better than the native crystals, SeMet crystals were used to collect higher resolution data at 2.1 Å on the same beamline. All data were processed using the HKL2000 program suite (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The SeMet-substituted SmcR crystal belongs to the space group P212121. There were four molecules in the asymmetric unit with a packing density of ∼2.62 Å3/Da, corresponding to an estimated solvent content of ∼53.42%. The structure was determined by utilizing the anomalous signals from selenium atoms using the program SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which identified 18 sites. Density modification and subsequent automated model building were carried out using the program RESOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The initial RESOLVE-built model was used as a guide to build the remainder of the protein manually into density-modified electron density maps with the program COOT (21Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar). The refinement was performed with REFMAC5 (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). The SeMet-substituted crystal structure was solved at 2.1 Å resolution by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (23Vagin A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar) using the partially refined model of the SeMet crystal at 2.3 Å resolution. The refinement included the translation-liberation-screw procedure. The final refined model resulted in Rfree and Rcryst values of 0.251 and 0.198, respectively. No density was visible for the N-terminal five amino acid residues (Met-1 to Ile-4) of chain A, two residues (Met-1 and Asp-2) of chain C, and three residues (Met-1 to Ile-4) of chain D, nor for the three C-terminal residues (Glu-203 to Glu-205) of chain B, and two residues (His-204 and Glu-205) of chain D. These residues were not included in the model. The model contained 806 amino acid residues, including a cloning artifact (alanine) at the N terminus of the molecule B, 6 sulfate ions, and 453 water molecules, and satisfied the quality criteria limits of the program PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab The in vivo dimerization of SmcR was assessed using a bacterial two-hybrid system that allows easy in vivo detection of functional interactions between two proteins (26Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Briefly, SmcR was genetically fused to two complementary fragments, T25 and T18, that constitute the catalytic domain of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase as follows: the smcR gene was subcloned into the PstI and KpnI sites of pUT18C and pKT25, resulting in the hybrid plasmids, pHS450 and pHS451, respectively. For the subcloning, smcR was amplified from the template plasmid, pHS103, using the primers SMCRT18F and SMCRT25R, and SMCRT25F and SMCRT25R for pUT18C and pKT25, respectively. Association of the two-hybrid proteins, in other words the dimerization of SmcR, results in functional complementation between the T25 and T18 fragments and leads to cAMP synthesis in the adenylate cyclase-deficient E. coli strain, BTH101. The cAMP protein then triggers the transcriptional activation of lacZ. To assess the phenotype, we performed a β-galactosidase assay (see under “In Vivo Activity of SmcR”). Critical residues involved in the dimerization of SmcR in the C-terminal region were mutated using gene splicing by overlap extension (27Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis. Primers used to create the site-directed mutants of the C-terminal region of SmcR are listed in supplemental Table S2. These mutated DNAs were introduced into the bacterial two-hybrid system vector pUT18C. The eight site-directed mutant plasmids created in this manner were designated as pSM01 to pSM08 (supplemental Table S1). In addition, pYJ03 and pYJ08 were constructed to assess the binding effect of SmcR to the vvpE operator region PvvpE, using the primers DH0601F and DH0601R, based on pSM03 and pSM08 as templates. All constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The purified His-tagged SmcR protein was used to raise a primary antibody by immunizing Sprague-Dawley rats on three occasions at 3-week intervals with 200 μg of the protein for each immunization. Western immunoblotting was performed according to the procedure previously described by Jeong et al. (28Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The binding of SmcR and its mutants to the labeled DNA and electrophoretic analysis of the DNA-protein complexes were performed as described in a previous study (9Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45072-45081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In brief, the radioactively labeled DNA probe containing the operator region PvvpE, which is activated directly by SmcR, was generated by PCR using 32P-labeled VVPE021 and unlabeled VVPE022 as primers. This probe (20 ng) was incubated with increasing amounts of SmcR or its mutants in reaction buffer (0.1 m KCl, 0.02 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for 30 min and then separated by electrophoresis. To determine the in vivo activity of SmcR, two different reporter systems were used. For the repression activity, wild-type and mutant smcR genes in the pHis series plasmids were subcloned into pBAD24BS (supplemental Table S1). The resulting plasmids were designated as the pBSS series, and these plasmids were co-transformed with the reporter plasmid, pKS0710, into E. coli DH5α cells. The reporter plasmid was constructed by fusing the promoter region of VV2_1398 to the plasmid pHK0011 containing a promoterless luxAB luciferase gene (29Jeong H.S. Jeong K.C. Choi H.K. Park K.J. Lee K.H. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13875-13880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As described in the previous study (12Lee D.H. Jeong H.S. Jeong H.G. Kim K.M. Kim H. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23610-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the promoter region of VV2_1398 was one of the targets under direct control by SmcR. The binding of SmcR to the promoter region resulted in a total repression of its activity (data not shown). E. coli carrying one of the pBSS plasmids and the pKS0710 reporter plasmid was used for the in vivo assay. Overnight cultures of each BSS strain were diluted 100-fold into fresh LB containing 0.2% l(+)-arabinose and appropriate antibiotics, and then grown at 37 °C for 3.5 h. The A600 and cellular luminescence of 100 μl of each culture with 0.01% (v/v) decanal were detected by an InfiniteTM M200 microplate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) and expressed in arbitrary relative light units as described previously (9Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45072-45081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For the V. vulnificus system, a series of plasmids expressing wild-type SmcR, or its mutants, were constructed as follows: a gene fragment containing wild-type smcR and the rrnB terminator was amplified by PCR using pBSS-WT as a template, with the primers SMCR0805 and SMCR0806 carrying KpnI and XbaI sites, respectively. The resulting fragment was ligated into the same restriction enzyme sites of pJH0311 (15Goo S.Y. Lee H.J. Kim W.H. Han K.L. Park D.K. Lee H.J. Kim S.M. Kim K.S. Lee K.H. Park S.J. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 5586-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), resulting in the plasmid pBSJH-WT. Five other members of the pBSJH series were constructed by exchanging the wild-type smcR gene with the mutated smcRs in the pHis series of plasmids by cutting and ligating at the NcoI and XhoI sites. These pBSJH series of plasmids in E. coli SM10λpir were then transferred into the V. vulnificus reporter strain, DH0602, by conjugation. This reporter strain is the smcR and lacZ double-knock-out mutant containing the vvpE gene fused to a promoterless lacZ on its chromosome. The activity of the SmcR variants was determined by measuring β-galactosidase activity. The β-galactosidase activity was determined by the chloroform/SDS method described previously by Miller (30Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1976: 352-355Google Scholar). DSC experiments were performed with a DSC calorimeter from MicroCal (Northampton, MA) at a scan rate of 1.0 °C/min. Measurements were carried out at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. The buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol from the last step of protein dialysis was used in the reference cell of the calorimeter. Data were analyzed with MicroCal DSC standard analysis software. The PvvpE (5′-atcttattgataaatctgcgtaaaaaa-3′) and pseudo-palindromic PvvpE-mod (5′-ttcttattgataaatttgtgaataaaa-3′) duplex DNAs were chemically synthesized. The SmcR binding affinities for both PvvpE and PvvpE-mod were analyzed by an ITC experiment. SmcR and duplex DNA were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and 300 mm NaCl, respectively. Samples were then degassed by vacuum aspiration for 15 min prior to loading, and titration was carried out at 25 °C. The calorimetric assay was performed using a VP-ITC (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). The stirring speed was 300 rpm, and the thermal power was recorded every 10 s. We titrated 0.3696 mm (calculated as a dimer) of SmcR in the syringe against 0.0272 mm PvvpE in the reaction cell (∼1.6 ml) and 0.1537 mm SmcR was titrated against 0.0076 mm of PvvpE-mod. Thermogram analysis for the titration was performed using the Origin package (version 7) supplied with the instrument. The crystal structure of SmcR was refined at 2.1 Å resolution. There are two homodimers in the asymmetric unit, arranged as molecules A and B in one homodimer and C and D in the other. The two molecules in each dimer are related by a 2-fold rotation axis (Fig. 1a). The refined model is entirely composed of α-helices. The structure of each SmcR molecule is essentially identical, with root mean square deviations of 0.95 Å (A and B), 0.43 Å (A and C), and 0.68 Å (A and D) of the Cα atoms. Superimposition of the Cα atoms of each dimer results in a root mean square deviations of 0.43 Å. The SmcR monomer is composed of nine α-helices: α1 (14–31), α2 (39–46), α3 (50–56), α4 (60–82), α5 (89–106), α6 (109–119), α7 (126–150), α8 (159–179), and α9 (183–196) and adopts a two-domain architecture, which includes the N-terminal DNA binding domain and the large C-terminal dimerization domain. The first three α-helices embrace a three-helix bundle that contains a canonical helix-turn-helix motif (α2 and α3). The dimerization domain of SmcR is formed by α-helices 4–9, with the α-helices 8 and 9 in each monomer forming an antiparallel four-helix dimerization motif. The overall fold of SmcR results in an Ω-shaped structure. A search conducted using DALI (31Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar) revealed that SmcR is structurally related to the TetR superfamily (Fig. 1b), which includes the V. cholerae transcriptional regulator, HapR (PDB ID code 2PBX; Z = 26.8) (14De Silva R.S. Kovacikova G. Lin W. Taylor R.K. Skorupski K. Kull F.J. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the Staphylococcus aureus multidrug binding transcriptional repressor, QacR (PDB ID code 1JUP; Z = 15.7) (32Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), as well as a number of other transcriptional regulators. The HapR protein is a homologue of LuxR, the quorum-sensing master transcriptional regulator of V. harveyi, and shows ∼70% amino acid identity with SmcR. QacR, however, is not related to LuxR or its homologues, and shows about 13% amino acid identity with SmcR. A recent study revealed that the dimerization of the quorum-sensing transcription factor, TraR (the LuxR homologue in the LuxI/LuxR-type quorum-sensing system of the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens), enhances resistance to cellular proteases and maintains biological activity (33Pinto U.M. Winans S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The dimerization of quorum-sensing response regulators is known as a signaling molecule binding-dependent event (34Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 35Qin Y. Luo Z.Q. Smyth A.J. Gao P. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5212-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, the dimerization of SmcR seems to occur in a signaling molecule-independent manner, although definitive evidence supporting this assumption has been lacking. In addition, the biological function of SmcR dimerization is uncertain. SmcR undergoes dimerization in the C-terminal domain. The C-terminal α-helices 8 and 9 in each monomer pack against one another to form an antiparallel, four-helix bundle at the subunit interface (Fig. 2a). Hydrophobic contacts by nonpolar residues are prominent at the dimerization interface and are involved in stabilizing the dimer structure. Residues involved in the interface are Asp-161, Leu-165, Gly-168, Ile-169, Tyr-171, Ser-172, Val-175, Gln-176, Arg-179, Leu-189, Tyr-193, Met-196, and Cys-198. In addition, Trp-126 on α-helix 7 stabilizes the dimerization by stacking against Arg-179 from the other molecule.

UV irradiation stimulates melanin production in melanocytes by increasing intracellular cAMP. Expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), especially HSP70, is induced by various stressors, including UV irradiation, to provide cellular resistance to such stressors. In this study we examined the effect of expression of HSP70 on melanin production both in vitro and in vivo. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a cAMP-elevating agent, stimulated melanin production in cultured mouse melanoma cells, and this stimulation was suppressed in cells overexpressing HSP70. IBMX-dependent transcriptional activation of the tyrosinase gene was also suppressed in HSP70-overexpressing cells. Expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which positively regulates transcription of the tyrosinase gene, was up-regulated by IBMX; however, this up-regulation was not suppressed in HSP70-overexpressing cells. On the other hand, immunoprecipitation and immunostaining analyses revealed a physical interaction between and co-localization of MITF and HSP70, respectively. Furthermore, the transcription of tyrosinase gene in nuclear extract was inhibited by HSP70. In vivo, UV irradiation of wild-type mice increased the amount of melanin in the basal layer of the epidermis, and this increase was suppressed in transgenic mice expressing HSP70. This study provides the first evidence of an inhibitory effect of HSP70 on melanin production both in vitro and in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2035545569,"The thyrotropin receptor [thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR)], a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is endogenously activated by thyrotropin, which binds to the extracellular region of the receptor. We previously identified a low-molecular-weight (LMW) agonist of the TSHR and predicted its allosteric binding pocket within the receptor's transmembrane domain. Because binding of the LMW agonist probably disrupts interactions or leads to formation of new interactions among amino acid residues surrounding the pocket, we tested whether mutation of residues at these positions would lead to constitutive signaling activity. Guided by molecular modeling, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of 24 amino acids in this spatial region, followed by functional characterization of the mutant receptors in terms of expression and signaling, measured as cAMP accumulation. We found that mutations V421I, Y466A, T501A, L587V, M637C, M637W, S641A, Y643F, L645V, and Y667A located in several helices exhibit constitutive activity. Of note is mutation M637W at position 6.48 in transmembrane helix 6, which has a significant effect on the interaction of the receptor with the LMW agonist. In summary, we found that a high proportion of residues in several helices surrounding the allosteric binding site of LMW ligands in the TSHR when mutated lead to constitutively active receptors. Our findings of signaling-sensitive residues in this region of the transmembrane bundle may be of general importance as this domain appears to be evolutionarily retained among GPCRs."
https://openalex.org/W2065470506,"The accessory protein Vpx is encoded by lentiviruses of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and the simian immunodeficiency SIVsm/SIVmac lineage. It is packaged into virions and is indispensable in early steps of monocyte infection. HIV-1, which does not encode Vpx, is not able to infect human monocytes, but Vpx enables infection with HIV-1. The underlying mechanism is not completely understood. In this work, we focus on Vpx-mediated intracellular postentry events as counteraction of host cell proteins. We found that Vpx binds to apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide 3 family member A (APOBEC3A; A3A), a member of the family of cytidine deaminases, present in monocytes. This interaction led to a reduction of the steady-state protein level of A3A. A single-point mutation in Vpx (H82A) abrogated binding to A3A and single-round infection of monocytes by HIV-1. Taken together, our data indicate that lentiviral Vpx counteracts A3A in human monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2038766367,"Long-term facilitation (LTF) in Aplysia is a leading cellular model for elucidating the biochemical mechanisms of synaptic plasticity underlying learning. In Aplysia, LTF requires translational control downstream of the target of rapamycin (TOR) complex 1 (TORC1). The major known downstream targets of TORC1 are 4E binding protein (4E-BP) and S6 kinase (S6K). By removing the site within these regulators required for their interaction with TORC1, we have generated dominant negative proteins that disrupt specific pathways downstream of TORC1. Expression of dominant negative S6K, but not dominant negative 4E-BP, in Aplysia sensory neurons (SNs) blocked 24-h LTF. TORC1 is directly activated by the small GTP-binding protein, Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb). To determine the effects of TORC1 activation on translation in Aplysia neurons, we have examined the effects of expressing a constitutively active form of the Aplysia orthologue of Rheb, ApRheb (ApRheb(Q63L)). Expression of ApRheb(Q63L) increased 4E-BP phosphorylation and the level of general, cap-dependent translation within the SN cell soma in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. This increase in cap-dependent translation was blocked neither by dominant negative 4E-BP nor dominant negative S6K. Thus, we demonstrate that S6K is an important downstream target of TORC1 in Aplysia and that it is necessary for 24-h LTF, but not for TORC1-mediated increases in somatic cap-dependent translation."

Aurora kinases are involved in multiple functions in mitosis, including centrosome separation and maturation; spindle assembly and stability; chromosome condensation, congression, and segregation; and cytokinesis. They possess a conserved catalytic domain, whereas their N-terminal domain varies, contributing to different localization of the kinase within the cell (1Kollareddy M. Dzubak P. Zheleva D. Hajduch M.

Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Thus, Aurora kinases represent attractive targets for anti-cancer drug development. Indeed, small molecule inhibitors have been developed and are currently being tested in clinical trials (5Carpinelli P. Moll J. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov.

The identification of mechanism of action-related biomarkers and the discovery of new substrates is of crucial importance not only to better characterize the cellular role of the Aurora kinases but also to provide a clear readout of the in vivo activity of compounds. Aurora kinases have already been shown to phosphorylate a number of different substrates. Specifically, Aurora A phosphorylates TPX2, LIM protein, CDC25B, p53, BRCA1, ASAP, and others (7Dutertre S.

In early mitosis, the CPC promotes correct chromosome alignment and is responsible for the displacement of HP-1 from mitotic chromosomes by modifying histone H3, whereas at the end of mitosis, CPC regulates proper completion of cytokinesis (23Vader G.

Recently, for example, Aurora B, INCENP, and Borealin, but not survivin, have been reported to be components of the nucleolar proteome (30Andersen J.S. Lam Y.W. Leung A.K. Ong S.E. Lyon C.E. Lamond A.I. Mann M. Nature. 2005; 433: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Aurora B may also play a role in the nucleolar cycle because it regulates the RNA-methyltransferase activity of NSUN2, a protein involved in nucleolar architecture and nucleic acid metabolism during mitosis (31Sakita-Suto S.

Here we report the identification of a novel in vivo Aurora B substrate, MYBBP1A (Myb-binding protein 1A) (32Tavner F.J. Simpson R. Tashiro S. Favier D. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Macmillan E.M. Lutwyche J. Keough R.A. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). MYBBP1A was originally identified as a protein interacting with the leucine zipper of c-Myb (33Favier D. Gonda T.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 305-311PubMed Google Scholar). This protein has been reported to bind to a number of transcription factors, including the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor, PGC-1α, NF-κB, and Prep1, and to regulate their activity (34Díaz V.M. Mori S.

Biol. 2007; 366: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MYBBP1A is ubiquitously expressed and is a nuclear protein mainly localized to the nucleolus. It shares some homology with a yeast protein called POL5, reported to be an essential DNA polymerase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (38Yang W. Rogozin I.B. Koonin E.V. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). POL5 localizes to the nucleolus, where it binds near the enhancer region of ribosomal RNA-encoding DNA repeating units; indeed, pol5 mutants indicate that it is involved in ribosomal RNA synthesis in the nucleolus rather than in chromosomal DNA replication (39Shimizu K. Kawasaki Y. Hiraga S. Tawaramoto M. Nakashima N. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9133-9138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite the homology with POL5, a role for MYBBP1A in the nucleolus has not yet been described. Here we show a new role of MYBBP1A in mitosis. It is an in vitro and in vivo substrate for Aurora B, and we have identified the Aurora B-dependent phosphorylation site on MYBBP1A as Ser1303, which falls in a consensus sequence for Aurora kinases. This phosphorylation event is modulated in cells both by RNAi against Aurora B and by treatment with Danusertib (previously known as PHA-739358), a small molecule inhibitor of Aurora kinases presently under clinical development. Furthermore, we have shown that MYBBP1A depletion leads to prolongation of mitosis and mitotic spindle defects, suggesting an essential role of MYBBP1A in the normal progression of mitosis. Radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9) was used to extract proteins from cytoplasmic and nuclear pellets of asynchronous HeLa cells purchased from CILBiotech. The cytoplasmic and nuclear pellets were resuspended in cold radioimmune precipitation buffer, gently agitated at 4 °C for 45 min, and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g to separate cellular debris and aliquoted for use in further experiments. The insoluble nuclear radioimmune precipitation fraction (DNA-bound) was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 2% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 units/ml benzonase. After resuspension, the solution was sonicated on ice four times for 10 s each to break DNA and then centrifuged at 25,500 × g for 10 min in a refrigerated centrifuge to remove debris, and the supernatant was aliquoted and frozen in a bath of ethanol and dry ice. In this way, the DNA-bound proteins, such as histones, were extracted. To in vitro phosphorylate cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions, 1 μg/μl protein extract was used with 0.2 pmol/μl of Aurora A kinase in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7, 60 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The reaction took place at 30 °C for 30 min, and the samples were used for electrophoresis and Western blot analysis soon afterward. To in vitro phosphorylate recombinant MYBBP1A, Aurora A or Aurora B (150 nm) was used in a kinase buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 nm [32P]ATP phosphatase, and protease inhibitors; the reaction took place at 30 °C for 30 min. In order to render the reaction specific, a low concentration of radiolabeled ATP was used, following the Kestrel approach (40Knebel A. Morrice N. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The asynchronous HeLa nuclear extract was dialyzed against 50 mm MES, pH 6.5. A monoS column was pre-equilibrated in the presence of 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, and the nuclear extract was loaded onto the resin using AKTA Explorer. The unbound fraction was collected. After the loading, four elution steps at different NaCl concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 m) were performed, and the eluting proteins were collected. The unbound fraction and the 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 m fractions were then dialyzed against the same buffer (kinase buffer, excluding ATP and MgCl2) and concentrated for use in further experiments. The cDNA of MYBBP1A was purchased from Geneservice, and the coding sequence was cloned using the Gateway® system (Invitrogen) into pGEX2Tg. BL21CodonPlus Escherichia coli cells were used to express the protein (induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 21 °C overnight). The recombinant protein was then purified on GSH-Sepharose, and on-column cleavage with PreScission protease was performed. For the overexpression in mammalian cells, MYBBP1A coding sequence was cloned into the mammalian expression vector PCMV-Tag2A FLAG vector (Stratagene) in EcoRI-XhoI sites. Mutagenesis was performed with the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit. Cells were lysed in SDS buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS) and after sonication and boiling, total extracts of the indicated samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE precast gels (Invitrogen) or on 3–8% Tris-acetate gels and immunoblotted. The following antibodies have been used: anti-MYBBP1A (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); anti-BAF155 and anti-CDK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)); anti-FLAG (Sigma); anti-phosphohistone H3 Ser10 (Millipore); anti-Aurora A, anti-Aurora B, anti-cyclin B1, and anti-MCM2 (BD Biosciences); and anti-histone H3 (Abcam). Anti-phospho-MYBBP1A, here called anti-P-p160, was produced by Zymed Laboratories Inc., immunizing rabbits using the peptide KENRESLVVN. Immunoreactive signals were detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). For fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, cells were harvested, resuspended in cold PBS, fixed with cold (−20 °C) 70% ethanol in PBS, and stored at 4 °C for at least 1 h. Cells were then stained with propidium iodide (25 μg/ml) in PBS containing 50 μg/ml RNase A. The DNA content was analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). HeLa and U2OS cells (ECACC) were grown in E-MEM medium. Medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine, and cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in the presence of 5% CO2. U2OS-YFP-α-tubulin cells were transfected with a YFP-α-tubulin-overexpressing vector (Clontech) and selected in G418 (400 μg/ml). For experiments involving overexpression of MYBBP1A or the Ser1303 mutants, HeLa cells were transiently transfected for 24 h with 5 μg of the different constructs using Lipofectamine-2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Calyculin A (Sigma) was added 30 min before cellular lysis at 10 nm. For shake-off experiments, nocodazole (75 ng/ml) or taxol (0.5 μm) was added to the cells for 18 h, and then mitotic cells were harvested by shake-off and treated in the presence of the mitotic inhibitors with DMSO or Danusertib (PHA-739358) (1 μm) together with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 μm). λ-Phosphatase (New England Biolabs) (400 units) was used directly on cellular lysates (40 μg) for 1 h at 30 °C. RNAi experiments were performed with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) for 72 h. Different oligonucleotides were used: MYBBP1A (DHARMACON smart pool (M-020341-00-0010)), BAF155-oligo1 (ggatgctcctaccaataaa), BAF155-oligo2 (ttacggatgagaagtcaaa), Aurora A (gcacaaaagcttgtcctta), Aurora B (cgcggcacttcacaattga), Aurora C (gatgtgaggtttccactat), MCM2 oligo-A (ctgaccgatgaagatgtga), and MCM2 oligo-B (gggtgctcagatcaacatc). As a negative control, an oligonucleotide targeting the luciferase gene was used: Luc (cgtacgcggaatacttcga). All oligonucleotides were used at 80 nm. Protein digestion was performed with trypsin (Fluka) using the Digest Pro system (Intavis, Koeln, Germany), following the standard protocol. The elution mixture was then dried down in a speed vacuum and redissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) MS analysis or in deionized water for nano-LC MS/MS analysis. Samples for MALDI-time-of-flight (TOF) analysis were prepared by spotting 0.5 μl of peptide mixture with 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml in 50:50 acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and analyzed on a Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). All spectra were collected in reflector mode using four peptides of known mass as external calibration standards. Nano-LC MS/MS was performed with a low flow rate reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatograph equipped with a nano-flow splitter (Ultimate, Dionex-LC Packings) coupled on-line to a hybrid quadrupole-time of flight instrument (Q-Tof2, Micromass) equipped with a Z-spray source. Samples were injected onto a C18 precolumn (PepMap 0.3 × 5 mm, LC Packings) and preconcentrated and desalted with mobile phase A (95:5 water/acetonitrile (v/v), 0.05% formic acid). The separation of the peptides was then performed on a 75-μm inner diameter × 150-mm PepMap column (LC Packings) with a gradient from 5 to 60% mobile phase B (5:95 water/acetonitrile (v/v), 0.06% formic acid) in 58 min, followed by a washing step at 60% B in 15 min at a flow rate of 0.2 μl/min. The MS acquisition was performed in survey scan mode, where the Q-Tof selected doubly, triply, and quadruply charged ions above an intensity threshold of 10 counts/s for MS/MS analysis from each survey scan (automatic function switching). The instrument performed the MS/MS analysis under user-defined parameters of collision energy. For the subsequent protein identification, the .raw data files were converted into .pkl files that were matched in MASCOT searches of the NCBInr data base for mammalian sequences. Protein identifications were confirmed by manual MS/MS data analysis for at least one peptide per protein. U2OS cells stably overexpressing YFP-α-tubulin were seeded in a 12-well plate. Images of cells were taken every 30 min using a time lapse microscope (Cell Observer Zeiss) with a ×32 objective equipped with a motorized stage (Zeiss). Images were collected using Axio Vision software (Zeiss). Cells were fixed 24 h after transfection with 4% formaldehyde. After permeabilization in PBS 1× containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, staining was performed by incubating cells with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:2000 in PBS 1× containing 2% bovine serum albumin. After 1 h, slides were rinsed in PBS 1× and exposed to CY3 secondary antibody 1:500 (Amersham Biosciences). DNA was visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:1000). Images were acquired with an Axiovert 100 microscope (Zeiss) with a ×60 objective. In order to identify new substrates of Aurora kinases suitable for biomarker discovery, an in vitro kinase substrate search was performed. Aurora A was tested against a panel of proteins containing the reported Aurora consensus phosphorylation site (41Cheeseman I.M. Anderson S. Jwa M. Green E.M. Kang J. Yates 3rd, J.R. Chan C.S. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Cell. 2002; 111: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and it was shown to phosphorylate serine 220 of MCM2 (minichromosome maintenance 2), 4L. Rusconi and P. Carpinelli, unpublished observations. which in fact resides in a consensus motif for Aurora kinases (KENRESLVVN). MCM2 is required for replication origin activation along with other MCM partners and with members of the prereplication complex, including origin recognition complex, Cdc6 (cell division cycle 6), and Cdt1 (chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1) (42Costa A. Onesti S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and it has not previously been identified as an Aurora substrate either in vitro or in vivo. Therefore, we decided to raise a phospho-specific antibody against MCM2 Ser220 to investigate the existence of this phosphorylation event in vivo. As shown in Fig. 1A, the phospho-Ser220 MCM2 antibody indeed detects a single band specifically in extracts from nocodazole-treated mitotic HeLa cell and not from asynchronous cells. However, in contrast with the expected molecular mass of MCM2 (110–120 kDa), the detected band was at 160 kDa with no other bands visible even after prolonged exposure (data not shown). These results indicate that the anti-phospho-Ser220 MCM2 antibody indeed recognizes a band in cell lysates although at a molecular weight different from the expected one and that this signal peaks upon nocodazole treatment. To explain this difference in molecular mass, we hypothesized that 1) some heavy post-translational modification was increasing the molecular mass of MCM2 or altering its electrophoretic mobility or 2) the antibody raised against the phosphorylation site Ser220 MCM2 was cross-reacting with some other unrecognized protein. To rule out the second hypothesis, we performed RNAi experiments against MCM2, followed by nocodazole treatment and Western blot analysis using total-MCM2 and phospho-MCM2 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, despite the complete silencing of MCM2 obtained with two different small interfering RNA oligonucleotides (oligo-A and oligo-B), the antibody against phospho-Ser220 MCM2 still detected a band at 160 kDa in lysates from nocodazole-arrested cells. This indicates that the phospho-MCM2 antibody is cross-reacting in cellular protein extracts with a protein different from MCM2. Therefore, we tried to determine if this protein (that we denoted p160) was an in vivo substrate for Aurora. The first step in the identification process was to check if p160 was also present in asynchronous cell extract and, if so, to verify if this could be phosphorylated in vitro using Aurora kinases, yielding a phospho-p160 signal. This would allow us to work with protein extracts from asynchronous cells, which are more manageable than nocodazole-treated cell extracts and easier to obtain in large amounts. HeLa cytoplasmic, nuclear, and DNA-bound protein extracts were prepared from asynchronous cells, heated at 60 °C for 10 min to inactivate endogenous kinases, and used in an in vitro kinase assay using Aurora A kinase (43Troiani S. Uggeri M. Moll J. Isacchi A. Kalisz H.M. Rusconi L. Valsasina B. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The presence of phospho-p160 was assessed by Western blot analysis. As a positive control, an extract from nocodazole-arrested HeLa cells was included. As shown in Fig. 2A, phospho-p160 was detected only in the nuclear fraction after phosphorylation with Aurora A kinase, indicating that p160 is a predominantly nuclear protein. Both in the cytoplasmic and in the nuclear fraction, a band at 120 kDa was visible after in vitro phosphorylation. This band may correspond to MCM2, suggesting that under these in vitro conditions, the antibody is also able to recognize phospho-Ser220 MCM2. Given that it was possible to follow p160 presence by in vitro phosphorylation of asynchronous cell extracts and Western blot analysis with the phospho-Ser220 MCM2 antibody, hereafter denoted phospho-p160, we decided to fractionate the HeLa nuclear extract using monoS ion exchange chromatography in order to enrich a fraction with p160 and try to isolate it. Binding of the nuclear extract to monoS resin was performed at pH 6.5 in MES buffer in the absence of salt. Elution was performed in a stepwise mode, and five different fractions were collected, corresponding to the unbound, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 m NaCl elution steps. All of these fractions were dialyzed against the same final buffer, concentrated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and then used in an in vitro kinase assay. Following in vitro phosphorylation with Aurora kinase, the phospho-p160 signal was only detected in the 1 m NaCl fraction (Fig. 2B). The HeLa nuclear extract, cytoplasmic extract, and 1 m fraction were then submitted to electrophoresis in a 3–8% Tris-acetate gel in order to enhance resolution and achieve a clearer detection in the high molecular weight range. Looking at the differential bands, we could detect a faintly Coomassie-stained band at the expected molecular weight present only in the nuclear extract (NE) and in 1 m fractions (Fig. 2C). We excised this band and subjected it to trypsin digestion for MS identification. MALDI-TOF analysis of tryptic digests from the 1 m and nuclear extract fractions revealed the presence of a high score candidate named MYBBP1A (supplemental Table S1). The tryptic digest was also analyzed by LC MS/MS, which allowed us to confirm MYBBP1A identification and also revealed the presence in both samples of a second putative p160 candidate, the SNF complex 155-kDa component BAF155 (supplemental Table S2). To discriminate between the candidates and confirm the identity of p160, RNAi experiments were performed against MYBBP1A or BAF155 (Fig. 2D). HeLa cells were transfected separately with two different RNAi oligonucleotides specific for BAF155 or with a pool of 4 oligonucleotides against MYBBP1A. Cells were then treated with nocodazole, and only mitotic cells were harvested and analyzed to enrich the p160 mitosis-specific signal. As reported in Fig. 2D, MYBBP1A depletion abrogates the phospho-p160 signal, whereas depletion of BAF155, similarly to control cells (Luc), does not affect p160 phosphorylation, suggesting that indeed the p160 phosphorylation signal is related to MYBBP1A expression. No modulation was observed for MCM2, Aurora A, or Aurora B levels upon MYBBP1A or BAF155 RNAi. To rule out the possibility that p160 reduction could be simply due to a secondary event caused by MYBBP1A knock-down, MYBBP1A was cloned and overexpressed in HeLa cells as a FLAG-tagged protein. As reported in Fig. 2E, Western blot analysis on asynchronous cells using the phospho-p160 antibody detected a p160 band only in cells transfected with MYBBP1A, confirming that MYBBP1A is recognized by this antibody. Furthermore, the MYBBP1A band was more intense when HeLa cells were treated with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (Fig. 2F), and conversely, treatment of cellular lysates with λ-phosphatase completely abrogates the signal (Fig. 2G). This indicates that anti-phospho-p160 specifically recognizes phosphorylated MYBBP1A. To verify if"
https://openalex.org/W1995268827,"Fas apoptosis inhibitory molecule (FAIM) has been demonstrated to confer resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes and hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that FAIM is up-regulated in thymocytes upon T cell receptor (TCR) engagement and that faim(-/-) thymocytes are highly susceptible to TCR-mediated apoptosis with increased activation of caspase-8 and -9. Furthermore, injection of anti-CD3 antibodies leads to augmented depletion of CD4(+)CD8(+) T cells in the thymus of faim(-/-) mice compared with wild-type control, suggesting that FAIM plays a role in thymocyte apoptosis. Cross-linking of the TCR on faim(-/-) thymocytes leads to an elevated protein level of the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77, which plays a role in thymocyte apoptosis. Interestingly, in the absence of FAIM, there are reduced ubiquitination and degradation of the Nur77 protein. Faim(-/-) thymocytes also exhibit a defective TCR-induced activation of Akt whose activity we now show is required for Nur77 ubiquitination. Further analyses utilizing FAIM-deficient primary thymocytes and FAIM-overexpressing DO-11.10 T cells indicate that FAIM acts upstream of Akt during TCR signaling and influences the localization of Akt to lipid rafts, hence affecting its activation. Taken together, our study defined a TCR-induced FAIM/Akt/Nur77 signaling axis that is critical for modulating the apoptosis of developing thymocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2074891483,"Conformational differences in abnormal prion proteins (PrP(Sc)) have been postulated to produce different prion phenotypes. During the interspecies transmission of prions, the conformation of PrP(Sc) may change with passage; however, little is known about the mechanism of PrP(Sc) transition. In this study, novel PrP(Sc)-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were developed that could detect the PrP(Sc) of mouse but not that of sheep. By using these mAbs, we attempted to examine PrP(Sc) accumulated in mice inoculated with sheep scrapie serially up to five passages. The presence of PrP(Sc) in the mice was confirmed at all passages; however, mAb-bound PrP(Sc) conformer was detected only from the third passage onward. The generated mAb enabled tracing of a particular conformer during adaptation in sheep-to-mice transmission of prion, suggesting that the conformational transition of PrP(Sc) was caused by propagation of this conformer. Such mAbs capable of discriminating conformational differences may allow us to address questions concerning PrP(Sc) conformation and strain diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2090245001,"Carriers of mutations in the cell cycle checkpoint protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which represent 1-2% of the general population, have an increased risk of breast cancer. However, experimental evidence that ATM deficiency contributes to human breast carcinogenesis is lacking. We report here that in MCF-10A and MCF-12A cells, which are well established normal human mammary gland epithelial cell models, partial or almost complete stable ATM silencing or pharmacological inhibition resulted in cellular transformation, genomic instability, and formation of dysplastic lesions in NOD/SCID mice. These effects did not require the activity of exogenous DNA-damaging agents and were preceded by an unsuspected and striking increase in cell proliferation also observed in primary human mammary gland epithelial cells. Increased proliferation correlated with a dramatic, transient, and proteasome-dependent reduction of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) protein levels, whereas little or no effect was observed on p21(WAF1/CIP1) or p27(KIP1) mRNAs. p21(WAF1/CIP1) silencing also increased MCF-10A cell proliferation, thus identifying p21(WAF1/CIP1) down-regulation as a mediator of the proliferative effect of ATM inhibition. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that ATM is a human breast tumor suppressor. In addition, they mirror the sensitivity of ATM tumor suppressor function and unveil a new mechanism by which ATM might prevent human breast tumorigenesis, namely a direct inhibitory effect on the basal proliferation of normal mammary epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2140849972,"C1, the first component of the complement system, is a Ca(2+)-dependent heteropentamer complex of C1q and two modular serine proteases, C1r and C1s. Current functional models assume significant flexibility of the subcomponents. Noncatalytic modules in C1r have been proposed to provide the flexibility required for function. Using a recombinant CUB2-CCP1 domain pair and the individual CCP1 module, we showed that binding of Ca(2+) induces the folding of the CUB2 domain and stabilizes its structure. In the presence of Ca(2+), CUB2 shows a compact, folded structure, whereas in the absence of Ca(2+), it has a flexible, disordered conformation. CCP1 module is Ca(2+)-insensitive. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that CUB2 binds a single Ca(2+) with a relatively high K(D) (430 mum). In blood, the CUB2 domain of C1r is only partially (74%) saturated by Ca(2+), therefore the disordered, Ca(2+)-free form could provide the flexibility required for C1 activation. In accordance with this assumption, the effect of Ca(2+) on the autoactivation of native, isolated C1r zymogen was proved. In the case of infection-inflammation when the local Ca(2+) concentration decreases, this property of CUB2 domain could serve as subtle means to trigger the activation of the classical pathway of complement. The CUB2 domain of C1r is a novel example for globular protein domains with marginal stability, high conformational flexibility, and proteolytic sensitivity. The physical nature of the behavior of this domain is similar to that of intrinsically unstructured proteins, providing a further example of functionally relevant ligand-induced reorganization of a polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W2129223489,"Pax6 is a well conserved transcription factor that contains two DNA-binding domains, a paired domain and a homeodomain, and plays a key role in the development of eye, brain, and pancreas in vertebrates. The recent identification of the zebrafish sunrise mutant, harboring a mutation in the pax6b homeobox and presenting eye abnormalities but no obvious pancreatic defects, raised a question about the role of pax6b in zebrafish pancreas. We show here that pax6b does play an essential role in pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation, as revealed by the phenotype of a novel zebrafish pax6b null mutant and of embryos injected with pax6b morpholinos. Pax6b-depleted embryos have almost no β cells, a strongly reduced number of δ cells, and a significant increase of ϵ cells. Through the use of various morpholinos targeting intron-exon junctions, pax6b RNA splicing was perturbed at several sites, leading either to retention of intronic sequences or to deletion of exonic sequences in the pax6b transcript. By this strategy, we show that deletion of the Pax6b homeodomain in zebrafish embryos does not disturb pancreas development, whereas lens formation is strongly affected. These data thus provide the explanation for the lack of pancreatic defects in the sunrise pax6b mutants. In addition, partial reduction of Pax6b function in zebrafish embryos performed by injection of small amounts of pax6b morpholinos caused a clear rise in α cell number and in glucagon expression, emphasizing the importance of the fine tuning of the Pax6b level to its biological activity.

Many studies on the function of the murine Pax6 gene rely on the analysis of Pax6Sey (small eye) and Pax6Sey-Neu mutant mice, harboring distinct point mutations in the Pax6 coding region. These often lead to C-terminal truncations in the Pax6 protein, disrupting its activity (6Matsuo T. Osumi-Yamashita N. Noji S. Ohuchi H. Koyama E. Myokai F. Matsuo N. Taniguchi S. Doi H. Iseki S.

Previous studies have shown that the PD is crucial for Pax6 function because a mutation causing a deletion within this domain leads to a phenotype of the eyes and brain almost identical to that of Pax6 null mutants. On the other hand, the missense mutation Pax6Neu4, leading to an amino acid substitution within the HD, preventing DNA binding through this domain, also affects eye development but causes only subtle defects in telencephalon development (18Haubst N. Berger J. Radjendirane V. Graw J. Favor J. Saunders G.F. Stoykova A. Götz M. Development. 2004; 131: 6131-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These data suggest that most Pax6 target genes in the brain are regulated through the PD, whereas in the eye, the HD is also important. In vivo studies on the respective roles of the PD and HD in pancreatic cell differentiation have not yet been reported. Because of a genome duplication early in the evolution of teleost fish, two pax6 genes exist in zebrafish. Both are active in ocular and brain structures, but only one, pax6b, is expressed in pancreatic endocrine cells because of sequence divergence within the pancreatic cis-regulatory regions (24Kleinjan D.A.

This surprising finding was in sharp contrast with the severe pancreatic defects observed in the Pax6 mutant mice and prompted us to investigate further the role of pax6b in zebrafish pancreas development. In the present study, we demonstrate the crucial role of Pax6b for the differentiation of endocrine cells in the zebrafish pancreas and, by using morpholinos disrupting pax6b mRNA splicing, we show that the Pax6b homeodomain is dispensable for pancreas development.

Verbruggen, unpublished results. The antisense morpholino oligonucleotides of splicing (Gene Tools) used were as follows: Mo1Pax6b (5′-GGCTTCACAAGTCACCTGCAAAATC), Mo2Pax6b (5′-TTGATTTGCACTCACGCTCGGTATG), Mo3Pax6b (5′-AAAGTTGTGATCGTTCACCTTTCTC), Mo4Pax6b (5′-GGCAACCGTCTGCAAAAATATAACA), Mo5Pax6b (5′-TCGACACCTGAATGGACAGCAATAT), and Mo1mutArx (5′-GCGTCTTTATTAGCTCGTCAACACA) as control morpholino. These morpholinos target the exon-intron or intron-exon boundary. They were diluted in Danieau solution, from which 1000 pl were injected into the yolk of one-cell stage embryos. To check the injection efficiency, rhodamine dextran was added at 0.5% in the injected solution. Zebrafish embryos were injected at the one-cell stage with Mo1Pax6b (6 ng/embryo), Mo2Pax6b (4.5 ng/embryo), Mo3Pax6b (6 ng/embryo), Mo5Pax6b (2 ng/embryo), Mo2Pax6b plus Mo5Pax6b (4.5 ng + 2 ng/embryo), Mo3Pax6b plus Mo4Pax6b (6 ng + 4 ng/embryo), or an arx-mutated morpholino (1.7 ng/embryo). We performed a reverse transcription on 1 μg of mRNA extracted from these morpholino-injected embryos or from non-injected control embryos at 24 or 30 h postfertilization (hpf). The primers used for the PCR amplification on the obtained cDNA were as follows: pax6b paired domain (upstream primer, 5′-GAACGGCAGACCGTTACCGGACTC; downstream primer, 5′-CTCTGCCCGTTGAGCATTCTCAGC), pax6b homeodomain (upstream primer, 5′-GCAACAGATGGGTGCAGATGGC; downstream primer, 5′-CTGTATTCTTGCTTCCGGGAGGTC), and nkx6.2 (upstream primer, 5′-TATTCTGGCCGGGAATGATG; downstream primer, 5′-GCCTCTTTCGCCATTTAGTTCTT). cDNAs were subjected to 30 or 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 68 °C, followed by a final 7-min extension at 68 °C. Pax6 antibody was purified from rabbit antiserum after several injections of purified Pax6b C- terminal domain expressed in Escherichia coli (last 88 amino acids of Pax6b). This antibody reacts against both zebrafish Pax6a and Pax6b proteins. Immunofluorescence was performed on 22–24-hpf zebrafish embryos fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde using anti-Pax6 antibody (1:200) and Alexa-488 anti-rabbit (1:500; Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR)) as secondary antibody. Briefly, washes were performed in PBS plus 0.3% Triton X-100, and antibody incubations were in PBS plus 0.3% Triton X-100 plus 4% BSA. For Western blotting, crude extracts were prepared from 40 zebrafish embryos injected with various morpholinos. One-fifth of extracts were loaded on an acrylamide gel, analyzed with the anti-Pax6 (1:200) or an anti-tubulin (1:1000; Abcam) as primary antibodies and then with the second horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody (1:2000; Cell Signaling) and revealed with the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Microscope pictures were performed with an Olympus DP70 photocamera fixed on a BX60 Olympus microscope. Pax6 immunostaining was captured with a Leica TCS SP2 laser confocal microscope. All of the pictures were processed using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator software. Total RNA was extracted with Qiazol (Qiagen) from two different batches of 25 larvae injected with Mo2 or control morpholinos. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA by reverse transcription with the RT Transcriptor First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One-twentieth of the resulting cDNA was used for real-time PCR with the one-step 2× Mastermix (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium) containing SYBR Green. Thermal cycling was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7000 detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For all reactions, negative controls were run with no template present, and random RNA preparations were also subjected to sham quantitative RT-PCR (no reverse transcription) to verify lack of genomic DNA amplification. The relative transcript levels for the genes of interest (glucagon, insulin, and somatostatin transcripts) were obtained by the relative standard curve method and normalized with respect to the mean of two reference genes, EF1α and Rpl13a. Primers, the sequences of which are available upon request, were designed with Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and selected so as to span exon-exon junctions, to avoid detection of genomic DNA. To determine the function of Pax6b in the zebrafish pancreas, we first injected fertilized zebrafish eggs with an antisense morpholino (Mo2) annealing to the exon 6-intron 6 junction of the pax6b gene. This morpholino disrupts RNA splicing at that junction, causing the removal of exon 6 coding sequences in pax6b transcripts, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon in the paired domain (see Fig. 4 and see below for further detailed descriptions). Almost no full-length Pax6b protein could be detected in the pancreas of injected embryos by immunostaining, whereas expression of the paralog Pax6a protein was still easily detected in the neural tube by the same anti-C-terminal Pax6 antibody (Fig. 1, A and B). Formation of the different pancreatic endocrine cells was then analyzed in the Mo2 morphants at 3 days postfertilization (dpf) and compared with those of uninjected embryos or of embryos injected with an unrelated sequence morpholino used as a control. Almost no insulin-expressing β cells were detected in the Mo2 morphants, as opposed to an average of 25–35 insulin-expressing cells in control embryos (Co) (Fig. 1, C and D). The number of somatostatin-expressing cells was also drastically decreased in about 90% of the morphants (Fig. 1, E and F). Conversely, ghrelin-expressing cells were barely detectable in wild-type embryos but numerous and easily observed in all of the Mo2 morphants (Fig. 1, G and H). The number of glucagon-expressing cells was not significantly affected in the morphants injected with 4.5 ng of Mo2 (Fig. 1, I and J). However, injection of 9 ng of Mo2 morpholino resulted in a reproducible decrease of glucagon cells (data not shown). To determine whether pax6b knockdown affected development of the pancreatic exocrine tissue, Mo2 morpholino was injected in the ptf1a:GFP transgenic zebrafish line. No obvious change of the exocrine tissue could be detected in the morphants (Fig. 1, K and L), consistent with the lack of pax6b expression in these cells. Very similar endocrine pancreatic defects were observed when embryos were analyzed 30 hpf (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 1Pancreatic function of the zebrafish pax6b gene.

Thus, we decided to further analyze the pancreatic phenotype of the sunrise mutants at 30 and 3 dpf. No difference could be detected between sunrise homozygous embryos and their wild-type siblings in the number of either α, β, δ, or ϵ cell types (supplemental Fig. S2). To confirm that the endocrine pancreatic defects in Mo2 morphants are due to the knockdown of pax6b and not of Mo2 off-targets, we analyzed the pancreas of a novel zebrafish pax6b mutant recently identified at the Zebrafish Mutant Resource (available on the World Wide Web). This pax6b mutant allele (sa0086) harbors a C to A substitution changing codon 109 (Tyr) to a premature stop codon. Thus, this allele encodes a Pax6b protein possessing a truncated paired domain and lacking the whole homeodomain plus the transactivation C-terminal domain (Fig. 2). Based on the pax6 allelic mutant series described in mammals and in Drosophila, the pax6bsa0086 allele corresponds to a null mutation. Crosses between pax6bsa0086 carrier fish generated homozygous mutant embryos, all displaying severe lens defects (Fig. 2, A and B). However, the expressivity was variable, from a reduction of the lens size in some mutants to a complete lack of lens in others. The pancreatic phenotype of the homozygous pax6bsa0086 mutants was similar to the Mo2 morphants with almost an absence of β cells and a strong increase of ϵ cells in all homozygous mutants (Fig. 2, C–F). A marked diminution of somatostatin-expressing cells was also detected in mutants, as in Mo2 morphants, but the level of reduction varied between mutant embryos (n = 14), one mutant displaying a complete lack of δ cells, nine mutants containing 1–5 δ cells, and three possessing 6–10 δ cells (Fig. 2, G–I). With regard to glucagon-expressing α cells, some mutants were presenting with an almost normal level or a slight decrease of α cells (n = 7), whereas other mutants displayed a severe reduction (n = 5) (Fig. 2, J–L). Thus, the analysis of the pax6bsa0086 mutant strengthens the knockdown data, confirming the essential role of Pax6b in the differentiation of endocrine cells in the zebrafish pancreas. Given the important role of Pax6b in the endocrine pancreas, the apparent normal pancreas of the sunrise mutant is quite surprising. One explanation might be that the sunrise missense mutation occurring in the pax6b homeobox is a hypomorphic mutation causing only partial loss of Pax6b activity, sufficient to produce morphological abnormalities in the eye but not sufficient to affect cell differentiation in the endocrine pancreas. To test this hypothesis, we injected zebrafish eggs with different amounts of pax6b Mo2 morpholino, and we examined the eyes and counted the number of insulin-expressing cells in each morphant (Fig. 3). We used a doubly transgenic zebrafish line harboring the insulin:dsRed transgene for monitoring the number of β cells and the Pax6b:GFP transgene for monitoring the entire endocrine pancreatic cell lineage and the retinal neurons. Expression of the endogenous insulin gene was also checked by whole mount in situ hybridization (inlets in the bottom panels of Fig. 3A). As the amount of injected Mo2 morpholino increased, the lens appeared increasingly smaller, almost disappearing at 4.5 ng (Fig. 3, top panels). Precise measurement of the lens surface for each experimental condition revealed a dose-dependent decrease (Fig. 2B). In parallel, a similar progressive reduction was also detected in the expression of both the insulin:dsRed transgene and the endogenous insulin gene. In contrast, the total number of pancreatic endocrine cells expressing the Pax6b:GFP transgene was not affected (Fig. 3, middle panels) (data not shown). Quantitative analyses showed that the morpholino dose required to reduce the lens size was the same as the dose required to reduce the number of β cells. Thus, the phenotypic difference between the pax6bsa0086 mutants and the sunrise mutants cannot be explained by different thresholds of Pax6 activity required for development of the eyes and of the pancreas. Another hypothesis that might explain the phenotypic difference between sunrise mutants and the pax6bsa0086 mutants is that the DNA binding activity of Pax6b in pancreatic cells relies on the paired domain rather than on its homeodomain. This would explain why sunrise mutants, harboring a missense mutation within the Pax6b homeobox, display normal pancreatic cell differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we designed two other morpholinos, Mo3 and Mo4, targeting the intron-exon splicing junctions at both ends of exon 8 (Fig. 4, top panels). Exon 8 encodes the N-terminal region of the Pax6b homeodomain, containing the leucine 244 residue that is mutated in the sunrise mutant. Because this exon is 159 bp long, its deletion from pax6b transcripts should lead to removal of the N-terminal part of the homeodomain without causing a frameshift in the coding region. To determine the splicing defects generated by morpholino injection, RNA extracted from morphants and from uninjected control embryos was subjected to RT-PCR designed to amplify a pax6b cDNA region corresponding to the HD. To that end, one pair of primers was used (see the blue arrows in the top panel of Fig. 4), and the amplicons were analyzed directly by sequencing and gel electrophoresis (see the bottom panels in Fig. 4). The injection of Mo3 alone, encompassing the exon 8-intron 8 junction, efficiently disrupted splicing at this site, as revealed by the slightly larger amplified cDNA fragment. Direct sequencing of this amplicon revealed the insertion of the first 22 bp of intron 8 in the majority of pax6b transcripts. This insertion leads to a frameshift in the coding sequence, generating nine added codons followed by a stop codon 4 bp downstream from the insertion. Thus, we can infer that Mo3 morphants express a Pax6b protein containing the paired domain and the linker region but lacking the C-terminal transactivation domain and a functional homeodomain (see schematic representations of Pax6b protein in Fig. 4). In zebrafish embryos injected with a mixture of the Mo3 and Mo4 morpholinos, pax6b transcripts displayed only a deletion of exon 8, as shown by gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing. Because this deletion does not cause a frameshift, translation of these transcripts results in synthesis of a Pax6b protein containing the paired domain and the C-terminal transactivation domain but lacking the C-terminal part of the linker region and the N-terminal part of the homeodomain. Western blotting using a Pax6 antibody raised against the C-terminal domain confirmed the expression of this truncated Pax6b protein in Mo3+Mo4 morphants (supplemental Fig. S3). When eye morphology and the number of pancreatic β cells were examined in these morphants (Fig. 5), the lens appeared significantly reduced in size in both Mo3 and Mo3 + Mo4 morphants, but β cell formation was strongly reduced only in the former. This demonstrates that the Pax6b homeodomain is not essential for β cell differentiation. We also determined the splicing defects caused by other morpholinos (Mo1, Mo2, and Mo5) designed to affect coding regions within the paired domain. The pax6b mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR, followed by direct sequencing and gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). Mo1, encompassing the exon 5-intron 5 junction, blocked splicing at this site, causing retention of intron 5. This insertion introduces 14 amino acids"

Aha1 cochaperone (for Activator of Hsp90 ATPase) is the only cochaperone known to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp90 and thus is proposed to positively regulate client protein activation (1Caplan A.J.

Biol. 2009; 16: 235-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). AHA1 was first identified as a homologue of Saccharomyces HCH1, which was isolated as a high copy suppressor of the growth defect of a temperature-sensitive mutation in the Hsp90 middle domain, hsp82-E381K (17Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The 350-residue Aha1 protein exhibits 36% sequence similarity to Hch1 within its N-terminal region (to residue 153). Aha1 cochaperone is a member of a ubiquitous family of eukaryotic proteins, although to date, only Candida albicans has been found to contain an Hch1 homologue (18Panaretou B. Siligardi G. Meyer P.

Saccharomyces strains lacking HCH1, AHA1, or both are viable, but growth is temperature-sensitive, particularly in the hch1Δ aha1Δ double disruption strain in nonfermentable carbon sources.

Conflicting reports suggest that the N-terminal domain of Aha1 and the full-length Hch1 activate Hsp90 ATPase activity, but the temperature-sensitive mutation of HSP82 used to isolate these suppressors does not exhibit a defect in ATPase activity at the nonpermissive temperature (4Harst A.

The N-terminal domain of Aha1 binds to the middle region of Hsp90, and this binding competes with the binding of the early cochaperones Hop/Sti1 and p50/Cdc37 and the late cochaperone p23/Sba1, all cochaperones that inhibit Hsp90 ATPase suggesting other possible mechanisms of action (4Harst A.

Most recently, a variety of in vitro and in vivo methods, including molecular footprinting and cross-linking, and structure-function mutation analysis of Aha1 were used to define sites of interaction between full-length mammalian Aha1 and Hsp90 (25Koulov A.V.

Finally, Aha1 cochaperone expression is up-regulated in a number of tumor lines, coincident with the activation of several signaling kinases (26Holmes J.L. Sharp S.Y. Hobbs S. Workman P.

Taken together, these findings are consistent with the proposed role of Aha1 cochaperone as a positive regulator of Hsp90 client proteins, but the mechanism remains unclear. glucocorticoid receptor hemagglutinin cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Here, we explore the role of Aha1 cochaperone in the activation of a native Saccharomyces client protein, the MAL activator that regulates the maltose-induced expression of the genes for maltose fermentation. This analysis builds on results reported in Ref. 28Ran F. Bali M. Michels C.A. Genetics. 2008; 179: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar that can be summarized as follows. Working with Myc-tagged alleles of the chaperone genes, Ran et al. (28Ran F. Bali M. Michels C.A. Genetics. 2008; 179: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) showed that the in vivo temporal order of Hsp90-Hsp70 chaperone complexes formed during maltose induction of the MAL activator parallels that demonstrated in vitro for induction of the glucocorticoid receptor (see Fig. 10) (reviewed in Refs. 16Wegele H. Müller L. Buchner J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar and 24Wandinger S.K. Richter K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18473-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) with some variations on this theme. During chaperone-dependent activation, nascent MAL activator progresses sequentially from the so-called early complex, in which it binds with Ssa1, the Saccharomyces Hsp70, and next to the intermediate complex in which it is associated with Ssa1, Hsp82, and Sti1, the Saccharomyces Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hop, respectively. The MAL activator intermediate complex is stable in the absence of inducer maltose, but addition of maltose causes the release of inducible MAL activator from the complex in an active form capable of DNA binding and transcription activation. Ran et al. (28Ran F. Bali M. Michels C.A. Genetics. 2008; 179: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) demonstrated significant differences between the chaperone activation pathway for the MAL activator and that of the glucocorticoid receptor. Primarily, Hsp70 rather than Hsp90 serves as the negative regulator of the inducible MAL activator, and retention of the MAL activator in the intermediate complex in an inactive form, as opposed to the final complex, is essential for inducible regulation. The temporal order of the MAL activator chaperone pathway proposed by Ran et al. (28Ran F. Bali M. Michels C.A. Genetics. 2008; 179: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and diagramed here in Fig. 10 is based on several findings. Deletion of STI1 causes activation defects for both inducible and constitutive MAL activators and results in the loss of Hsp82 binding and an enhancement of Ssa1 binding even in the presence of inducer maltose, indicating that the temporal order of complex formation is blocked at a point downstream of the early complex. Noninducible activator proteins form complexes with Ssa1 and not with Hsp82 or Sti1 in the absence of inducer, whereas inducible Mal63 and constitutive activators are similarly bound to Ssa1 and not Hsp82, only in sti1Δ. This result suggests that the early complex is formed first for all MAL activators alleles. Additionally, it indicates that constitutive activators must pass from the early complex to the intermediate complex and on to the final complex with Hsp82 to be fully active. Of particular relevance to the study described here, the work of Ran et al. (28Ran F. Bali M. Michels C.A. Genetics. 2008; 179: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) demonstrates that the different alleles of the MAL activator can be used as markers to distinguish the early, intermediate, and final chaperone complexes. As described above, in the absence of maltose, inducible Mal63 MAL activator is retained in what appears to be an intermediate complex. Thus copurification of a cochaperone with inducible Mal63 MAL activator in the absence of maltose suggests that the cochaperone is a component of the intermediate complex. By contrast, noninducible mutant MAL activators bind to Ssa1 but not Hsp82 or Sti1 and never progress beyond what appears to be an early complex. Copurification of a cochaperone with noninducible mutant MAL activators in the absence of maltose suggests that this cochaperone is a component of the early complex. Furthermore, constitutive MAL activators are seen to bind only Hsp82, not Ssa1 or Sti1, and, even in the absence of maltose, appear to progress rapidly through the early and intermediate complexes to form a final complex and possibly some unbound activator. Thus, a cochaperone that copurifies with constitutive MAL activators is a candidate component of the final complex. In this study, we use these different classes of MAL activator mutants as well as a super-inducible mutant, as described previously (29Danzi S.E. Bali M. Michels C.A. Curr. Genet. 2003; 44: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), as markers of the different chaperone complexes to identify the complex or complexes containing the cochaperone Aha1. In contrast to studies with GR and v-Src kinase, the results reported here show that Aha1 cochaperone is a negative regulator of inducible Mal63 MAL activator and that it interacts genetically and physically with the C terminus of certain MAL activators. Alternative models of the mechanism of this novel regulation are presented under the “Discussion.” Table 1 lists the Saccharomyces strains used for this study. Details of their construction are described below or in Ref. 28Ran F. Bali M. Michels C.A. Genetics. 2008; 179: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar. All carry naturally occurring defective copies of the MAL1 and MAL3 loci encoding functional maltose permease and maltase genes but nonfunctional MAL activator alleles and require a plasmid-borne copy of the MAL activator gene for the expression of the MAL structural genes. Plasmids carrying the triple HA-tagged alleles of MAL63 and the various mutant MAL activators are described in detail in Ref. 28Ran F. Bali M. Michels C.A.

An untagged version of the plasmid expressing noninducible mal63-401 was constructed from the plasmid carrying the tagged gene by removal of the NcoI fragment containing the triple HA tag by digestion and religation.

The following primers were annealed, and the 3′ end was extended by one round of DNA synthesis using TaqDNA polymerase in a thermal cycler in the absence of added template DNA. The upstream primer (5′GGG GTCGAC GGG GGG GGG GAG CAG AAA CTC ATC TCT GAA GAA GAT CTG GAA CAA AAG TTG ATT TCA GAA GAA GAT CTG) consists of the following: a SalI site (in boldface), two glycine codons, followed by the sequence encoding two copies of the Myc epitope tag, and Myc-1 and Myc-2 (underlined). The second copy of the Myc epitope sequence is complementary to and anneals to the Myc-2 sequence (underlined) of downstream primer (5′ GGG GTCGAC TTAATTAATTAA CAG ATC TTC CTC AGA GAT GAG CTT CTG TTC CAG ATC TTC TTC TGA AAT CAA CTT TTG TTC 3′) containing SalI site (in boldface), four stop codons (italics), followed by sequences encoding two Myc tags, Myc-2 and Myc-3 (underlined). The PCR product was digested with SalI and cloned into the SalI-digested pFA6-KanMX2 (28Ran F. Bali M. Michels C.A. Genetics. 2008; 179: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to create plasmid pFA6-Myc3-Stop-kanMX2. The final modified Myc3-Stop-KanR cassette was confirmed by sequencing. A PCR-based one-step replacement method was used to insert the triple yc epitope tag at the C terminus of AHA1 in W303 to create strain CMY8301. The amplified product consists of the following sequences in order: 37 bases upstream of the stop codon of AHA1, one copy of the sequence encoding the triple Myc epitope, a stop codon, the KanR gene cassette, and 45 bases downstream of the AHA1 stop codon, and it was synthesized as follows. Plasmid pFA6-Myc3-Stop-kanMX2 was used as a template to amplify the kanamycin (G418) resistance gene (30Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) with the upstream primer (5′ CGT TCT ATT AAA TTG ACA TTC GGC TTT GGT GCC GTA TTA GGG GGG GGG GAG CAG AAA CTC 3′) and the downstream primer (5′ TGG TAA ATT CCG GGG AGG CCG TCG GCG CCG GGC CGC AAA AGT AGG GCA TAG GCC ACT AGT GGA 3′). The upstream primer contains 38 bases upstream of the TAA stop codon of AHA1 and 21 bases complementary to the 5′ end of the modified triple Myc-Stop-KanR cassette. The downstream primer contains 45 bases from the 3′ end of AHA1 followed by 18 bases from the 3′ end of the KanR cassette. Bases homologous to the template are in boldface. The PCR product was transformed directly into strain W303 and transformants were selected on YPD supplemented with 200 μg/ml geneticin (catalog no. 10131-035, Invitrogen) (28Ran F. Bali M. Michels C.A. Genetics. 2008; 179: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Epitope tagging of AHA1 was confirmed by PCR and Western blotting analysis. Nested PCR was used to amplify the fragment containing the genomic AHA1/Myc3 open reading frame from strain CMY8301. In the first round of PCR, the upstream primer (5′ CTT ACT TTC GTT ATT CCT TTC AGT CTT ATT 3′) annealing to the AHA1 promoter region ∼30 bp upstream of the open reading frame and the downstream primer (5′ CGG ATT CAG TCG TCA CTC AT 3′) annealing to the sequence ∼500 bp downstream of the genomic tagged AHA1/Myc3 were used to amplify a product containing the complete AHA1/Myc3 open reading frame with some flanking sequences. This primary PCR product was used as a template in a second round PCR to amplify a smaller fragment containing the AHA1/Myc3 open reading frame with the following primer pair. The upstream primer (5′ GGG GGATCC ATG GTC GTG AAT AAC CCA 3′) has a BamHI site (in boldface) and anneals to the first 6 codons of the AHA1/Myc3 open reading frame. The downstream primer (5′ GGG ATCGAT TTA ATT AAT TAA CAG ATC TTC 3′) has a ClaI site (in boldface) and anneals to a site downstream of the sequence of the triple Myc tag. The second PCR product was digested with BamHI and ClaI and cloned into the BamHI- and ClaI-digested vector p423GPD placing AHA1/Myc3 under the control of the constitutive GPD promoter. The construct was confirmed by sequencing and Western blotting. Plasmid p423GPD-AHA1C/Myc3 was constructed by amplifying the C-terminal half of the AHA1 open reading frame from codon 156 using plasmid p423GPD-AHA1/Myc3 as the target. The upstream primer (5′ GGG GGATCC ATG CCC GAA TCT CAG GTG AAA 3′) has a BamHI site (in boldface) and an ATG translation start codon and anneals to codons 156–161 of the AHA1 open reading frame (underlined). The downstream primer was the same as the second round downstream primer in the amplification of AHA1/Myc3 (see above). The construct was confirmed by sequencing and Western blotting. Deletion of STI1 in strains CMY1200 and CMY1300 carrying Myc-tagged HSP82/Myc and SSA1/Myc, respectively, was complicated by the presence of the KanR cassette at each of these tagged genes. One-step gene disruption to replace STI1 with the hygromycin resistance gene HygR was accomplished by replacing the open reading frame of STI1 with the coding region of HygR without including homologous sequences derived from the KanR cassette. The upstream primer, shown in Table 2, consists of 62 bp of the STI1 promoter sequence immediately upstream of the start codon of STI1 followed by 22 bp of the HygR open reading frame (boldface). The downstream primer (Table 2) consists of 60 bp of sequence homologous to the region immediately downstream of STI1 and 21 bp homologous to the 3′ end of the HygR open reading frame (boldface), including the stop codon. This primer pair was used to amplify the HygR open reading frame from the template plasmid pAG32 (30Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). The PCR product was transformed directly into strains CMY1200 and CMY1300, and transformants were selected on YPD supplemented with 200 mg/liter hygromycin (catalog no. 10687-010 Invitrogen). Constructs were confirmed by PCR and Western blotting. The other CMY1200 and CMY1300 deletion strains were constructed by a similar procedure with primer sequences listed in Table 2.TABLE 2One-step gene deletion primers Open table in a new tab Cultures were grown to mid-log phase in selective minimal media containing the indicated carbon source and lacking appropriate nutrients for plasmid maintenance.

The pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulates kinase activity of hBVR and activates NF-κB, a transcriptional regulator of GPBP mRNA. Increased GPBP activity is associated with several autoimmune conditions, including Goodpasture syndrome. Here we show that in HEK293A cells hBVR binds to GPBP and down-regulates its TNF-α-stimulated kinase activity; this was not due to a decrease in GPBP expression. Findings with small interfering RNA to hBVR and to the p65 regulatory subunit of NF-κB show the hBVR role in the initial stimulation of GPBP expression by TNF-α-activated NF-κB; hBVR was not a factor in mediating GPBP mRNA stability. The interacting domain was mapped to the 281CX10C motif in the C-terminal 24 residues of hBVR. A 7-residue peptide, KKRILHC281, corresponding to the core of the consensus D(δ)-Box motif in the interacting domain, was as effective as the intact 296-residue hBVR polypeptide in inhibiting GPBP kinase activity. GPBP neither regulated hBVR expression nor TNF-α dependent NF-κB expression. Collectively, our data reveal that hBVR is a regulator of the TNF-α-GPBP-collagen type IV signaling cascade and uncover a novel biological interaction that may be of relevance in autoimmune pathogenesis.

The NC1 domain initiates the braiding of the collagenous domains into a triple helical structure (protomer) and then mediates the assembly of two individual protomers yielding a quaternary structure known as the hexamer. The autoantibody epitope is cryptic in the hexamer, and the mechanism for its immunological exposure remains unknown. The autoimmune reaction results in deposits of autoantibodies along alveolar and glomerular basement membranes, causing lung hemorrhage and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, the two cardinal clinical manifestations of GPS (1Hudson B.G.

The 77-kDa GPBP polypeptide (GPBP in this report) interacts with type IV collagen, whereas the 91-kDa isoform associates with the cellular membrane and regulates extracellular levels of the 77-kDa polypeptide (7Revert F.

In the present study we concentrated on the interaction of hBVR with the 77-kDa form of GPBP by transfecting cells with an expression plasmid encoding this form and using the cytoplasmic fraction of the cell lysate; hBVR is a soluble protein.

Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Although the downstream effectors of GPBP have been well characterized, the upstream regulator(s) of GPBP activity and expression have remained unknown. The present study has identified the role of hBVR in such capacity. Among all proteins identified in the human cell, BVR arguably has the most expansive range of functions (for review, see Refs. 10Kapitulnik J. Maines M.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2009; 30: 129-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar and 11Maines M.D. Physiology. 2005; 20: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). hBVR is a 296-residue polypeptide that was initially characterized in the context of its function as a reductase, with a unique dual pH/cofactor-dependent activity profile for the conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin in the heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) metabolism pathway (12Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). hBVR has the distinction of being a dual specificity kinase (13Lerner-Marmarosh N. Shen J. Torno M.D. Kravets A. Hu Z. Maines M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), one of the rare forms of kinases that phosphorylate Ser/Thr/Tyr residues (14Hunter T. Harvey Lect. 1998; 94: 81-119PubMed Google Scholar). The pleiotropic functions result from hBVR possessing numerous consensus regulatory motifs with demonstrated function that are primarily contained in the regulatory carboxyl half of the protein; this region folds into a large six-stranded β-sheet, the putative protein-protein interactive domain (15Whitby F.G. Phillips J.D. Hill C.P. McCoubrey W. Maines M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The 24-residue segment of hBVR that forms the C-terminal α-helix contains the Cys281-Xaa10-Cys292 configuration that is involved in divalent metal binding and protein-protein interactions and the D(δ)-Box motif. This motif is a common feature of kinases in the MAPK signaling cascade (16Jacobs J.M. Marek D. Walton H.S. Sinclair P.R. Sinclair J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 17Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar). The hBVR D(δ)-Box core sequence is KKRILHC (aa 275–281). The secondary structure of hBVR (PDB accession 2H63), which resembles that of the rat enzyme (15Whitby F.G. Phillips J.D. Hill C.P.

The nuclear localization and export signals of hBVR play crucial roles in transcriptional activity of the MEK/ERK/Elk (19Maines M.D. Miralem T. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Shen J. Gibbs P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8110-8122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Lerner-Marmarosh N. Miralem T. Gibbs P.E.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6870-6875Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). hBVR also plays a role in energy-dependent transportation of extracellular heme into the nucleus (22Tudor C. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Engelborghs Y. Gibbs P.E. Maines M.D. Biochem. J. 2008; 413: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GPBP and hBVR signaling pathways converge at the level of activation by TNF-α, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is an activator of hBVR kinase activity and an inducer of GPBP expression (4Granero F. Revert F. Revert-Ros F. Lainez S. Martínez-Martínez P. Saus J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5291-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Lerner-Marmarosh N. Miralem T. Gibbs P.E. Maines M.D. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3949-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cytokine is an upstream activator of the transcription factor NF-κB (23Duran A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3910-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 24Karin M. Greten F.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by TNF-α is inhibited by biliverdin, whereas hBVR reverses the inhibition (25Gibbs P.E. Maines M.D. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 121: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Notably, a peptide corresponding to the hBVR D-Box motif blocks activation of PKC-ζ in response to TNF-α (20Lerner-Marmarosh N. Miralem T. Gibbs P.E. Maines M.D. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3949-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Activation of the two proteins, however, have opposing effects on cellular pathophysiology, with GPBP, as alluded to above, being a proinflammatory factor, whereas hBVR occupies a center stage in the battery of defense mechanisms against reactive oxygen species (ROS) available to the cell (26Sedlak T.W.

In its capacity as a reductase, BVR converts biliverdin, the product of heme oxygenase-1 and -2, to bilirubin (27Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Bilirubin is a quencher of ROS (28Mancuso C. Pani G. Calabrese V.

To understand whether the sharing of the signaling activator extends to a potential cross-talk between GPBP and hBVR, we undertook this study through which we reveal the occurrence of protein-protein interactions between the two kinases (down-regulation of GPBP kinase activity by hBVR) and that the TNF-α-NF-κB-dependent expression of GPBP is regulated by the reductase. The findings identify a previously unrecognized biological circuit controlled by TNF-α, which may be relevant in GPS pathogenesis. N-Myristoylated peptides that correspond to the hBVR residues indicated in parenthesis were synthesized by EZBiolab (Westfield, IN). The specific sequences were KEVVGKDL (aa 134–141), KRNRYLSF (aa 224–231), KKRILHC (aa 275–281), and KYCCSRK (aa 290–296). TNF-α was obtained from Calbiochem, anti-FLAG M2-affinity beads and ATP were from Sigma, and [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]orthophosphate were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Rabbit anti-hBVR polyclonal antibody was isolated as done previously (12Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Arch. Biochem.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was a product of Pall Science Corp. (Pensacola, FL). Goat anti-p65 polyclonal antibody and protein A/G beads were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The hBVR open reading frame was cloned in both pGEX-4T2 (for expression in Escherichia coli) and pcDNA3 (for mammalian cell expression). pEGFP-hBVR construct was described earlier (40Kravets A. Hu Z. Miralem T. Torno M.D. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19916-19923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The truncated hBVR constructs, encoding aa 1–108, 1–272, 109–175, 158–296, 272–296, or 272–296 containing Cys281,292,293 changed to alanine, were prepared by PCR amplification of the wt cDNA using suitable primers and were cloned in pGEX-4T2. The plasmids were verified by sequencing. Plasmids encoding the 77-kDa FLAG-GPBP and the N-terminal peptide of GPA were generated as before (6Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA3-GPBP was generated by amplifying the open reading frame of GPBP using 5′-ctgaagatctatgtacccatacgatgttccagattacgctcttatgtcggataatcagagctggaactcgtcgggc and 5′-ctgactcgagctagaacaaaataggctttcctgcagttttttcttggacg primers, which also introduced a hemagglutinin epitope. The full-length GPBP sequence was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector, and the validity of the construct was confirmed by sequencing. The yeast two-hybrid screen used MATCHMAKER System 3 (Clontech). Full-length hBVR cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-aatccatggcgaatgcagagcccgagaggaa and 5′-gatggatccctcctcctcttacttccttg. The PCR product was cloned into the bait vector, pGBKT7, and was used to transform the yeast strain AH109 using the lithium acetate method as described by the manufacturer. The resulting strain was mated to Y187 yeast cells transformed with a human kidney cDNA library. Yeast colonies from the mating were screened for hBVR-interacting proteins. Candidate clones were selected on plates lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan and were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. The target plasmids of positive clones were recovered from the yeast cells, and the sequences of the cDNA inserts were determined. Bait and purified positive plasmids were used to transform the yeast cells, and the phenotype of the transformants examined served as a confirmation of the interaction. HEK293A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin G/streptomycin for 24 h to achieve 70% confluence. Cells were transfected depending on the experiment with up to 1 μg of pcDNA3-hBVR and/or pcDNA3-GPBP plasmid or with pcDNA3-FLAG-GPBP per 10-cm culture dish using Transfectin (Bio-Rad). hBVR-based myristoylated peptides were introduced into cells as before (20Lerner-Marmarosh N. Miralem T. Gibbs P.E. Maines M.D. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3949-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In experiments employing small interfering RNA (siRNA) for hBVR, viruses containing pSuper-sihBVR or sc-hBVR (control) were grown and packaged as described elsewhere (41Miralem T. Hu Z. Torno M.D. Lelli K.M. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17084-17092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with four plaque-forming units/cell. Double-stranded siRNA for the p65 regulatory subunit of NF-κB was introduced by transfecting cells with a 10 μm stock solution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) following the manufacturer's suggestions. In those experiments employing TNF-α, the cells were synchronized in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 18 h, then treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for the times indicated. For IP experiments, cell lysate (500 μg of protein) was incubated with polyclonal anti-hBVR antibodies (generated against hBVR isolated from human kidneys), anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma), or normal rabbit serum overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. IP after in vivo cross-linking was essentially performed as previously reported (7Revert F. Ventura I. Martínez-Martínez P. Granero-Moltó F. Revert-Ros F. Macías J. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30246-30255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The GST pulldown assay was performed as described previously (19Maines M.D. Miralem T. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Shen J. Gibbs P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8110-8122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Lysate prepared from HEK293A cells transfected with pcDNA3-GPBP was subjected to GST pulldown assays using 10 μg of E. coli-expressed GST-hBVR fusion protein or GST-fused truncated hBVR proteins. Proteins bound to GST beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Cell lysate was subjected to electrophoresis on 12 or 8% SDS-PAGE gels depending on the experiment, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. The antigen was visualized by the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). FLAG-tagged GPBP was detected using monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG antibody and visualized by ECL. The experimental procedure was based on one described previously (20Lerner-Marmarosh N. Miralem T. Gibbs P.E. Maines M.D. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3949-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were starved and labeled with carrier-free, HCl-free [32P]H3PO4 (100 μCi/ml) for 4 h before treatment with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for the duration appropriate to each experiment. Cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with immobilized-anti-FLAG or with polyclonal anti-hBVR antibodies. The phosphorylated and immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. GPBP kinase activity was measured in an assay system containing 10 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.0 and [γ32P]ATP, as previously described (6Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). hBVR kinase activity was determined in a system containing 20 mm MnCl2 and [γ32P]ATP at pH 8.0, as detailed before (13Lerner-Marmarosh N. Shen J. Torno M.D. Kravets A. Hu Z. Maines M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and blotting to nitrocellulose membrane followed by autoradiography. After allowing radioactivity to decay, the identity of the proteins was confirmed by antibody detection. RT-PCR was performed using total RNA isolated from cells transfected or infected with retrovirus expressing siRNA as described above. Synchronized cells were then treated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml). In experiments testing RNA stability, cells were treated with TNF-α for 6 h then with actinomycin D (2.5 μg/ml) for the indicated times before RNA extraction. Total RNA was purified from cells lysed with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendation. 2.5 μg of RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis using random hexamer primers. The cDNA was used as a template for quantitative RT-PCR using gene-specific primers and Taq polymerase in an ABI-fast 7500 PCR system. Products were detected by SYBR Green; specificity was determined from melting curves, and in some samples the reaction products were resolved by gel electrophoresis. Specific signals were normalized on 18 S rRNA and quantified by the ΔΔCT method. The S.E. in ΔΔCT was also determined in individual experiments; this error was included in the calculated relative mRNA level as error = mRNA(ΔΔCT) ± mRNA(ΔΔCT±S.E.). HEK293A cells seeded in 6-well plates were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid containing five copies of the NF-κB responsive element fused to a downstream luciferase gene (pNF-κB, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), either empty pEGFP or pEGFP-hBVR, and pCMV-β-gal plasmid reporter. After 12 h of transfection, cells were treated with TNF-α for an additional 12 h and then harvested, washed, and lysed. Five μl of lysate from each sample was used for the luciferase assay (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was used to assess transfection efficiency, and luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity. Data as presented in bar graphs are the means with S.D. of three experiments, each with triplicate samples. Statistical analyses used GraphPad prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance from which Student's t was calculated for all sample pairs. Differences were considered to be significant if p ≤ 0.05; it should be noted that differences between experiments were not significant. All experiments were performed three times unless otherwise indicated. Because a number of correlative phenomena suggested a possible link between hBVR and GPBP and the finding that in every instance that hBVR modulates activity of a cell signaling component protein-protein interaction is involved, we examined in a yeast two-hybrid screen system whether hBVR and GPBP interact. To explore this phenomenon, full-length hBVR was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen system using a human kidney cDNA library. Approximately 17 million yeast colonies were screened for hBVR-interacting protein(s). Among 31 positive clones, 11 exhibited sequence identity to the C-terminal domain (aa 466–624) and 1 encoded amino acid residue 150–292, including part of the heptad repeat of the coil-coil structure containing the bipartite nuclear localization of GPBP (6Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To confirm the results of the yeast two-hybrid screen, full-length GPBP was cloned into pcDNA3, a mammalian expression vector, and tested in an in vitro binding assay using GST-hBVR (Fig. 1a). In a GST pulldown assay, GST-hBVR, but not GST alone, precipitated GPBP from cell lysate. This interaction was confirmed in a follow-up IP experiment shown in Fig. 1, b and c, which used HEK293A cells co-transfected with pcDNA-hBVR and pcDNA-GPBP expression plasmids. In this experiment cell lysate was obtained and subjected to IP using either anti-hBVR (Fig. 1b) or anti-GPBP antibody (Fig. 1c). The precipitated complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with either anti-GPBP or anti-hBVR antibodies. As shown under both conditions, GPBP and hBVR were present in the precipitate. To address whether the interactions may have arisen as a consequence of overexpressing one or both proteins, the experiment was repeated in normal cells that had been cross-linked with formaldehyde before lysis and IP with monoclonal antibody to GPBP (N27) (Fig. 1d). Under in vivo cross-linking conditions hBVR was efficiently precipitated by N27, although there was a minor interaction of hBVR with the protein A-Sepharose beads. hBVR functions in TNF-α-NF-κB signaling, wherein it is activated by the cytokine and activates the transcription factor (20Lerner-Marmarosh N. Miralem T. Gibbs P.E. Maines M.D. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3949-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Gibbs P.E. Maines M.D. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 121: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). GPBP is also activated by TNF-α (4Granero F. Revert F. Revert-Ros F. Lainez S. Martínez-Martínez P. Saus J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5291-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in the following experiments, whether GPBP phosphorylation would be affected by hBVR was examined. First, the effect of TNF-α on phosphorylation of GPBP in the presence or absence of hBVR was tested (Fig. 2a). Cells overexpressing both proteins or GPBP alone were synchronized, metabolically labeled with [32P]H3PO4, and treated with TNF-α. Cell lysates were obtained and immunoprecipitated with FLAG-specific antibodies and used for analysis of phosphorylated GPBP. As displayed in the composite, TNF-α treatment produced a time-dependent increase in GPBP phosphorylation peaking at 15 min and returning to basal level by 45 min. TNF-α-stimulated GPBP phosphorylation, however, was markedly reduced when hBVR was co-expressed with GPBP. Next, to examine whether expression and subsequent binding of hBVR to GPBP also modulates the kinase activity of GPBP, GPBP was isolated from TNF-α-induced cells expressing increasing amounts of hBVR and assayed for autophosphorylation under optimal conditions for GPBP phosphate transfer (pH 7.0 in the presence of Mg 2+) (6Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12642-12649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2b, hBVR suppressed GPBP autophosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of hBVR on GPBP kinase activity extended to its ability to phosphorylate its substrate, GPA-derived peptide (Fig. 2c). As expected, GPBP isolated from cells not expressing recombinant hBVR efficiently phosphorylated GPA-derived peptide, whereas peptide phosphorylation was markedly suppressed when assaying GPBP isolated from cells co-expressing hBVR. Next, we questioned whether hBVR alters expression of GPBP. The following experiments were carried out to examine the effect of hBVR on TNF-α stimulation of GPBP expression; conditions in which hBVR was overexpressed as well as decreased using pcDNA-hBVR expression plasmid and si-hBVR, respectively, were used. In the first experiment the levels of GPBP mRNA were measured at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after TNF-α treatment using si-hBVR to reduce expression of hBVR. As we showed in previous studies (20Lerner-Marmarosh N. Mi"
https://openalex.org/W2084674892,"Residual structure in the fully unfolded state is a key element for understanding protein folding. We show that the residual structure in fully denatured photoactive yellow protein (PYP) is affected by isomerization of its p-coumaric acid (pCA) chromophore. The exposure of total surface area and hydrophobic surface area upon unfolding was quantified by denaturant m values and heat capacity changes (DeltaC(p)), respectively. The exposure of the buried surface area upon the unfolding of the acid-denatured state of PYP containing trans-pCA is approximately 20% smaller than that of the native state. In contrast, for the partially unfolded pB photocycle intermediate containing cis-pCA, unfolding-induced exposure of the surface area is not decreased. These results show that pCA photoisomerization reduces residual structure in the fully unfolded state. Thus, residual structure in the fully unfolded state of PYP is under direct experimental control by photoexcitation. The sensitivity of the unfolded state to pCA isomerization provides a novel criterion that residual structure in the unfolded state of PYP is native-like, involving native-like protein-chromophore interactions. A largely untested prediction is that native-like residual structure facilitates the conformational search during folding. In the case of PYP, refolding from the less disordered fully unfolded state containing trans-pCA indeed is substantially accelerated. The burial of hydrophobic surface area in the fully unfolded state suggests that a significant part of the hydrophobic collapse process already has occurred in the denatured state."

One role of intact u-PAR is the regulation of the Pg activation cascade by co-localizing u-PA and Pg on the plasma membrane (16Manchanda N. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14580-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ellis V. Whawell S.A. Werner F. Deadman J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Receptor-bound u-PA is inhibited by its cognate serine protease inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). This receptor-bound complex is cleared from the cell surface by a specific endocytic receptor, α2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). The rapid internalization provides an efficient mechanism for immediate down-regulation of the cell-surface proteolysis mediated by the u-PA·u-PAR complex. Receptor internalization via binding to tcu-PA·PAI-1 complexes and association with LRP is also thought to modulate cell migration, because intact u-PAR is recycled and redistributed on the cell surface, changing its spatial relationships with proteins in the extracellular matrix and on the cell membrane (18Cao C. Lawrence D.A. Li Y. Von Arnim C.A. Herz J. Su E.J. Makarova A. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Zhang L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1860-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This is important, because u-PA binding to u-PAR leads to a conformational change in the receptor that enhances the affinity between u-PAR and vitronectin (Vtn) (19Chapman H.A. Wei Y. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) in the matrix. Additionally, bound tcu-PA may be down-regulating functions by cleaving off D1 of a proximal u-PAR at two sites (Arg83 and Arg89), generating the cleaved form of u-PAR (D2D3) that is unable to bind u-PA (9Høyer-Hansen G.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ligand that strengthens the interaction between u-PAR and the matrix also has the potential to abolish such activities. Even so, the role of receptor cleavage on regulation of u-PAR-associated cellular processes remains poorly understood. We report here the development and characterization of a u-PAR mutant resistant to proteolysis by tcu-PA, to identify the importance of regulating receptor activity, especially in roles where the functions of active and cleaved u-PAR have been difficult to distinguish. This mutant is different from the previously generated u-PAR mutant, because this tcu-PA cleavage-resistant u-PAR (cr-u-PAR) was engineered with substitutions only in the u-PA cleavage sites (20Mazzieri R.

Cells expressing this cleavage-resistant mutant compared with the wild-type receptor exhibited identical ability to promote cell-surface Pg activation but demonstrated increased internalization of the receptor in the absence of tcu-PA·PAI-1 complexes, increased receptor recycling, as well as tcu-PA-independent heightened cell migration. We hypothesize that the faster internalization of cr-u-PAR is related to a propensity for pre-assembly with LRP. The results suggest that the cleavage-resistant u-PAR possesses certain functions associated with the conformationally active liganded u-PAR. Whether cleavage resistance of this form confers certain advantages to cells that are similar to those present in heavily glycosylated cleavage-resistant u-PAR in cancer cells remains to be studied (11Montuori N.

Active tcu-PA was generated by incubating single-chain u-PA with Pn-Sepharose beads, as previously described (16Manchanda N. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14580-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pg, Pn, and chymotrypsin were purchased from EMD Bioscience (San Diego, CA). Soluble u-PAR (su-PAR) was a kind gift from Dr. Andrew Mazar (Attenuon, San Diego, CA). The monoclonal antibody against the C terminus of LRP, 11H4, and receptor-associated protein (RAP) were kind gifts from Dr. Dudley Strickland (University of Maryland, MD). The somatomedin B (SMB) domain of Vtn was a kind gift from Dr. Michael Ploug (Finsen Laboratory, Denmark). Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone (CMK) (EMD Bioscience, San Diego, CA) was used to generate inactive tcu-PA (CMK·u-PA) (28Kettner C. Shaw E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 569: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CMK·u-PA was iodinated using 125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and IODO-GEN-coated tubes as previously described (29Schwartz B.S. Monroe M.C. Levin E.G. Blood. 1988; 71: 734-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Active wt PAI-1 and the stable mutant PAI-114–1B (30Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were kind gifts from Dr. Daniel Lawrence (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). PAI-114–1B was biotinylated using sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's suggestions. Rabbit α-human u-PAR polyclonal antibody was obtained by immunizing rabbits with human su-PAR. IgG fraction was immunopurified from sera using protein A-Sepharose beads (31Andrew S.M. Titus J.A. Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2001; (Chapter 16, Unit 16-13)Google Scholar). Antibody selectivity was determined via Coomassie staining and immunoblotting against human su-PAR. Pre-immunized serum was used as a control for nonspecific reactivity. For immunoblotting, ECL substrate was from Pierce, goat α-rabbit HRP and streptavidin-HRP were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). G418 sulfate (Gemini Bio, West Sacramento, CA), Hanks' balanced saline solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), non-enzymatic dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), and cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma) were of highest quality available. Detergents Triton X-100 and deoxycholate were from Sigma. Immobilized Protein G, sulfo-NHS-S-S-LC-biotin, and streptavidin-agarose beads were from Pierce. Wild-type human u-PAR cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR of mRNA from U937 lymphoma cells (CRL-1593.2, ATCC, Manassas, VA). Variant u-PAR was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers for generating cr-u-PAR mutations, Arg83 → Ala and Arg89 → Ala, were 5′-GCA ACT CTG GCG CAG CTG TCA CCT ATT CCG CAA GCC GTT ACC-3′, and its reverse and complementary primer (IDT Inc., Coralville, IA). All cDNA sequences were verified (High-throughput Sequencing and Genotyping Unit, University of Illinois-Urbana, IL), and the cDNA were inserted into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) via standard subcloning procedures using restriction digest. The following cell lines HEK-293 (293, CRL-1573,) and U937 were purchased from ATCC. Stable transfection of pcDNA3.1-(+) carrying the wt u-PAR or cr-u-PAR genes into 293 cells was accomplished using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 1 × 106 non-transfected 293, 293 wt u-PAR, or 293 cr-u-PAR cells were dissociated using non-enzymatic dissociation buffer and resuspended in DMEM with 0.1% BSA (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Cells were acid-washed to remove surface-bound proteins as previously described (16Manchanda N. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14580-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with 100 nm tcu-PA for 20 h at 37 °C. Cell membrane proteins were solubilized for analysis with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (32Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). 5 μg of cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and equivalent loading of proteins was achieved by quantitating samples using a BCA assay (Pierce). Samples were immunoblotted using polyclonal rabbit α-u-PAR and goat α-rabbit HRP. In some instances, purified su-PAR and endogenous u-PAR (5 × 106 3-day PMA-stimulated U937 cells prepared similarly for PAGE) (33Picone R. Kajtaniak E.L. Nielsen L.S. Behrendt N. Mastronicola M.R.

As previously described in Manchanda, et al. (16Manchanda N. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14580-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) CMK·u-PA was iodinated followed by a quenching step using 5 mm saturated tyrosine and 6 mm KI solution. 2.5 × 104 cells were harvested overnight in DMEM, washed, and incubated in serum-free DMEM, 0.1% BSA, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 10 μg/ml CHX with increasing concentration of 125I-CMK·u-PA for 4 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 100-fold excess unlabeled CMK·u-PA. Cells were washed, lysed using 0.1 n NaOH and 1% SDS, and analyzed in a Wallac Wizard Gamma Counter (Ramsey, MN). Samples were normalized by total protein concentration. 5 × 104 cells were seeded overnight. Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution before the addition of reaction buffer (DMEM with 0.1% BSA), preincubation with CMK-tcu-PA, tcu-PA, or chymotrypsin, as shown, and incubated with 10 nm tcu-PA for 30 min at 37 °C. Real-time cell-surface generation was monitored at 37 °C on a SpectroMax Gemini XS microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) essentially as described (7Ellis V. Behrendt N. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except using 56 nm Pg and 600 μm of the Pn substrate, H-d-Ala-Leu-Lys-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem, Torrance, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% BSA. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 360 and 460 nm, respectively. The rates of Pn generation were determined from parabolic plots of relative fluorescence unit versus time, fitting to a second-order polynomial, and then conversion to nanomolar Pn by reference to the amidolytic activity of purified Pn using the same fluorogenic substrate (34Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 3127-3134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Griffith M.J. Breitkreutz L. Trapp H. Briet E. Noyes C.M. Lundblad R.L. Roberts H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 1.5 × 105 cells were harvested 18 h prior to labeling. tcu-PA·PAI-1 complex was generated by incubating for 30 min at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, and full inhibition was determined using the chromogenic substrate, Spectrozyme UK (American Diagnostica, Stamford, CT). Cell-surface u-PAR was biotinylated using 200 μm sulfo-NHS-SS-LC-biotin as previously described (36Wu L. Gonias S.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 96: 1021-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated without or with 10 nm tcu-PA·PAI-1 complex for 30 min at 4 °C and exposed to DMEM with 0.1% BSA prewarmed to 37 °C to initiate internalization. At specified times, cells were treated with 100 mm dithiothreitol for 3 min at 37 °C, to reduce cell-surface biotin label but not cytoplasmic biotin, followed by lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Biotinylated membrane proteins were recovered from lysates via affinity-precipitation with streptavidin-agarose, followed by reduction and denaturation. 10 μl of total cell lysate were reduced to quantify the total amount of u-PAR found in the samples. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and u-PAR detected using our polyclonal rabbit α-u-PAR antibody. Alternatively, 293 cells expressing u-PAR were incubated with 10 nm of biotinylated PAI-114–1B·tcu-PA complex for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were exposed to 37 °C to initiate internalization. At specified times, cells were acid-washed followed by lysis with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. All samples were subjected to immunoblotting using streptavidin-HRP. Blots were analyzed by densitometry using the Kodak 1-D system. Samples were normalized to background. Control samples were prepared as described above and incubated with biotinylated PAI-114–1B·tcu-PA complex for 30 min at 37 °C except that 500 nm RAP was added to each incubation solution. 5 × 104 u-PAR-expressing cells were seeded overnight. Cells were incubated with tcu-PA·PAI-1 complex for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound complex was removed, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C. At specified times, 10 nm tcu-PA was added and the amount of cell-surface u-PAR was measured via the Pg activation assay as described above. Cell surface-associated tcu-PA activity was normalized to the maximal amount of tcu-PA activity in the absence of tcu-PA·PAI-1 complexes. In sets of control samples, 500 nm RAP was added to all incubation solutions for the allotted times. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as previously described (37Czekay R.P. Kuemmel T.A. Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1467-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Suspensions of 1 × 106 cells (293 wt u-PAR or cr-u-PAR), were incubated in DMEM with 0.1% BSA only or with additional 10 nm tcu-PA·PAI-1 complex for 30 min at 4 °C. Parallel samples of cells were exposed to buffer or incubated with either 500 nm RAP or 4 μm SMB. LRP-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the α-LRP monoclonal antibody, 11H4, and protein G-conjugated agarose beads as described by Czekay et al. (37Czekay R.P. Kuemmel T.A. Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1467-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and co-precipitated u-PAR was analyzed via immunoblotting as described above. 50 μl of total cell lysate were analyzed similarly to quantify the total amount of u-PAR found in the lysates. Blots were analyzed as described. Suspended 293 wt u-PAR and cr-u-PAR cells in DMEM, 0.1% BSA, and 100 μg/ml CHX were incubated with in the absence or presence of 100 nm CMK·u-PA for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by 100 nm chymotrypsin at 37 °C for the times shown (13Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed and lysed using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. 10 μg of total cellular protein lysate was analyzed via immunoblotting for u-PAR as described. 293 cells were resuspended as described above. 2 × 105 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.5 nm tcu-PA in serum-free DMEM for 15 min at 37 °C and then placed on the top portion of Transwell chambers (Corning, Corning, NY) coated previously with 10 μg/ml purified Vtn (5Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum was added to the bottom chamber, and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Migration was quantified using crystal violet staining as described previously (38Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The absorption of the eluted stain was read at 506 nm on a SpectroMax Plus 384 microplate spectrophotometer. To study the effects of receptor cleavage, we made mutations in the linker region of u-PAR (12Huai Q. Mazar A.P. Kuo A. Parry G.C. Shaw D.E. Callahan J. Li Y. Yuan C. Bian C. Chen L. Furie B.

The arginine in position 91 was left unchanged, because this residue is essential for Vtn binding (23Madsen C.D. Ferraris G.M. Andolfo A. Cunningham O. Sidenius N. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 24Gårdsvoll H. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13561-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1B, expression of wt u-PAR and cr-u-PAR were detected by immunoblotting. However, non-transfected 293 cells lack a band for any u-PAR form as described by other investigators (41Montuori N. Salzano S. Rossi G. Ragno P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In samples from cells expressing wt u-PAR and cr-u-PAR, there is an appearance of a band at ∼55 kDa that can be attributed to the intact receptor. The approximate 40-kDa band in these two u-PAR variants might be an underglycosylated u-PAR or partially degraded u-PAR. Cell lysates from PMA-stimulated U937 cells were positive controls (Fig. 1B). PMA stimulation increased u-PAR expression and increased glycosylation, leading to a higher molecular weight than 293-associated u-PAR (42Behrendt N. Rønne E. Ploug M. Petri T. Løber D. Nielsen L.S. Schleuning W.D. Blasi F. Appella E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6453-6460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of u-PAR in the 293 cells was confirmed by ligand-binding assays, wherein wt u-PAR was found to be expressed at a wide range of 0.7–2.2 × 106 receptors per cell among different clones, whereas cr-u-PAR was expressed at 1.5–5.5 × 106 receptors per cell among clones (Table 1).TABLE 1Specific binding of CMK-u-PA to 293 cells293 wt u-PAR293 cr-u-PARClone 2Clone 11Clone 13Clone 4Clone 7Clone 8KD (nm)1.3 ± 0.61.1 ± 0.41.1 ± 0.41.4 ± 0.41.5 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.2Sites/cell (106)2.0 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.60.7 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.13.8 ± 0.35.5 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Receptor cleavability was tested by the prolonged incubation of u-PAR-expressing 293 cells with a high concentration of tcu-PA (Fig. 1C). Exposure to tcu-PA converted 70% of wt u-PAR into the cleaved form. In contrast, when treated similarly cr-u-PAR cells show a single predominant band of intact u-PAR. The overnight incubation alone did not lead to robust u-PAR cleavage in either cell type. These results suggest that substitution of Arg83 and Arg89 led to a u-PAR mutant unable to be proteolyzed by tcu-PA. Dissociation constants for the binding of radiolabeled CMK·u-PA to three independent clones of cells expressing either wt u-PAR or cr-u-PAR ranged between 1.1 and 1.5 nm (Table 1), in close agreement with previous reports (43Stoppelli M.P.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 540-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that the expressed receptors were folded correctly and were adequately post-translationally modified. Non-transfected 293 cells showed no specific binding of CMK·u-PA in the ligand concentration range wherein u-PAR-expressing cells displayed saturable binding (data not shown). Based on the similar levels of receptor expression and affinities for u-PA, 293 wt u-PAR clone 2 and 293 cr-u-PAR clone 4 were chosen for further studies. Recombinant wt u-PAR and cr-u-PAR were able to support the initiation of Pg activation in a specific manner (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2A shows that, although wt u-PAR and cr-u-PAR receptor-expressing cells bound tcu-PA and activated Pg, CMK·u-PA pretreatment prevented this binding and subsequent Pn generation in both cell types. u-PAR cleavage should decrease the amount of available intact wild-type receptors that may bind tcu-PA, slowing Pg activation. To test this hypothesis, cells expressing wt u-PAR or cr-u-PAR were treated with tcu-PA or chymotrypsin to remove D1, followed by u-PA binding and assaying subsequent Pg activation as described. Fig. 2B shows that incubation of wt u-PAR cells with either excess tcu-PA or chymotrypsin resulted in a 55% decrease in Pn generation compared with non-treated cells, in agreement with previous findings (9Høyer-Hansen G.

In contrast, the addition of tcu-PA to cr-u-PAR cells led to a 38% increase in Pg activation over non-treated cells, which we attribute to the lack of receptor cleavage coupled with higher saturation of available uncleaved cr-u-PAR sites by the molar excess of tcu-PA.
