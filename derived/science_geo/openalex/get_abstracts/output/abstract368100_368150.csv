https://openalex.org/W1966132436,"Caloric restriction (CR), without malnutrition, delays aging and extends life span in diverse species; however, its effect on resistance to illness and mortality in primates has not been clearly established. We report findings of a 20-year longitudinal adult-onset CR study in rhesus monkeys aimed at filling this critical gap in aging research. In a population of rhesus macaques maintained at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, moderate CR lowered the incidence of aging-related deaths. At the time point reported, 50% of control fed animals survived as compared with 80% of the CR animals. Furthermore, CR delayed the onset of age-associated pathologies. Specifically, CR reduced the incidence of diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and brain atrophy. These data demonstrate that CR slows aging in a primate species."
https://openalex.org/W2051173215,"Neurogenesis and Spatial Memory The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is one of two sites in the brain where new neurons are produced throughout life. Adult-born neurons integrate into the dentate gyrus circuitry and are thought to play a role in learning and memory. However, their contribution to hippocampal function remains unclear. Clelland et al. (p. 210 ) disrupted neurogenesis in mice and used two behavioral tasks to test for impairment in the formation of uncorrelated episodic memory representations. In one task, two arms were presented and the mice were rewarded for choosing the most recently visited arm in an earlier sequence; in the second task, animals were rewarded for choosing a certain location on a touch screen. Ablation of neurogenesis affected discrimination performance in both tasks but only when the arms or screen locations were close to one another. Neurogenesis is thus necessary for spatial pattern separation in the dentate gyrus."

https://openalex.org/W2152971512,"Electrons Accepted Here Methane is produced in large quantities in marine sediments during the breakdown of organic matter. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that plays a large role in the regulation of climate. Methane is also an energy source for the abundant anaerobic methanotrophs that consume most of it before it ever reaches the atmosphere. The anaerobic oxidation of methane in marine systems depends on the presence of sulfate, which acts as an electron acceptor and is often considered essential for the reaction to proceed. Beal et al. (p. 184 ) report that anaerobic methane oxidation in marine sediments can be facilitated by iron and manganese, as well as by sulfate. Thus, anaerobic methane oxidation using iron and manganese could have been an important methane sink, and energy source, for the early biosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2133927870,"Boron is an element of fascinating chemical complexity. Controversies have shrouded this element since its discovery was announced in 1808: the new 'element' turned out to be a compound containing less than 60-70 percent of boron, and it was not until 1909 that 99-percent pure boron was obtained. And although we now know of at least 16 polymorphs, the stable phase of boron is not yet experimentally established even at ambient conditions. Boron's complexities arise from frustration: situated between metals and insulators in the periodic table, boron has only three valence electrons, which would favour metallicity, but they are sufficiently localized that insulating states emerge. However, this subtle balance between metallic and insulating states is easily shifted by pressure, temperature and impurities. Here we report the results of high-pressure experiments and ab initio evolutionary crystal structure predictions that explore the structural stability of boron under pressure and, strikingly, reveal a partially ionic high-pressure boron phase. This new phase is stable between 19 and 89 GPa, can be quenched to ambient conditions, and has a hitherto unknown structure (space group Pnnm, 28 atoms in the unit cell) consisting of icosahedral B12 clusters and B2 pairs in a NaCl-type arrangement. We find that the ionicity of the phase affects its electronic bandgap, infrared adsorption and dielectric constants, and that it arises from the different electronic properties of the B2 pairs and B12 clusters and the resultant charge transfer between them."
https://openalex.org/W2020275424,"Strolling Out on a Quantum Walk In a random walk, a walker moves one step to the left or one step to the right depending on the outcome of a coin toss. The distribution between possible locations is well known and forms the basis for algorithms in information processing, describing diffusion processes in physics or biology, and has even been used as a model for stock market prices. Karski et al. (p. 174 ) use a single caesium atom trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice to implement the quantum counterpart—a quantum walk. The coherence of a quantum system results in a departure from the classical picture, producing a distribution that is quite different that depends on the internal state of the atom. The results may have implications for search algorithms and quantum information processing protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2162791825,"Size Matters Cells of different types come in different sizes. Size is established by a trade-off of growth and division; as a result, the distribution of cell size in a population is held stable over time. A classic question in cell physiology is whether the growth rate of cells is constant over time or whether, as cells grow bigger during the cell cycle, they grow faster and faster. Using experimental and mathematical approaches, Tzur et al. (p. 167 ; see the Perspective by Edgar and Kim ) show that the growth rate of mouse lymphoblastoid cells in culture is slow in the G 1 phase and then increases to reach a constant exponential rate. Thus, there is an active size-control mechanism that limits size variation in animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2167972491,"Not Reston at All Reston ebolavirus is named, mistakenly perhaps, for Reston, Virginia, where it was discovered in the 1970s in imported macaques. After some alarm it was found not to be virulent in humans, uniquely among the ebola viruses, which are characteristically fatal causing a horrific spectrum of symptoms. Using a panviral detection assay, Reston ebolavirus has been rediscovered by Barrette et al. (p. 204 ) in domesticated pigs in the Philippines in association with other viruses that cause respiratory illness. The strains involved are closely related to the original macaque strain and, given how little variance there is among the viruses, it appears that it is freely circulating between these species possibly, like several other zoonotic viruses, having a reservoir in bats. Serological assays indicated that farm workers have become infected, although no obvious symptoms of human disease have been reported."
https://openalex.org/W2020072016,"Measurements of the abundance of common metabolites in cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells revealed an unusual state with respect to one-carbon metabolism. These findings led to the discovery of copious expression of the gene encoding threonine dehydrogenase (TDH) in ES cells. TDH-mediated catabolism of threonine takes place in mitochondria to generate glycine and acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), with glycine facilitating one-carbon metabolism via the glycine cleavage system and acetyl-CoA feeding the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Culture media individually deprived of each of the 20 amino acids were applied to ES cells, leading to the discovery that ES cells are critically dependent on one amino acid--threonine. These observations show that ES cells exist in a high-flux backbone metabolic state comparable to that of rapidly growing bacterial cells."

Turk et al. (p. 601 , published online 9 July) now show that it is possible for single primordial clouds to break up into two dense cores. Three-dimensional calculations, which follow the evolution of primordial gas (composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of deuterium and lithium) and dark matter starting from realistic, cosmological initial conditions, suggest that these cores may evolve to form binary star systems."
https://openalex.org/W1990063701,"Young and Flexible How an infant learns to understand and speak a language remains a deep scientific mystery even though millions of kids accomplish these feats each year. Furthermore, this learning capacity is apparently not even taxed to its utmost; children who grow up in bilingual families learn two languages just as rapidly as those who learn only one. Kovács and Mehler (p. 611 , published online 9 July) have assessed the cognitive flexibility of preverbal 1-year-old children raised in monolingual versus bilingual households and find that the bilingual group displays an impressive facility in handling inconsistent, language-like, inputs. That is, the kids exposed to two distinct languages since birth were able to associate two distinct syllabic structures—AAB and ABA—with looking leftward and rightward, whereas the monolinguals could only do so only with the simpler AAB structure."
https://openalex.org/W2070892675,"Background Rubber hand illusion (RHI) is a subject's illusion of the self-ownership of a rubber hand that was touched synchronously with their own hand. Although previous studies have confirmed that this illusion disappears when the rubber hand was touched asynchronously with the subject's hand, the minimum temporal discrepancy of these two events for attenuation of RHI has not been examined. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, various temporal discrepancies between visual and tactile stimulations were introduced by using a visual feedback delay experimental setup, and RHI effects in each temporal discrepancy condition were systematically tested. The results showed that subjects felt significantly greater RHI effects with temporal discrepancies of less than 300 ms compared with longer temporal discrepancies. The RHI effects on reaching performance (proprioceptive drift) showed similar conditional differences. Conclusions/Significance Our results first demonstrated that a temporal discrepancy of less than 300 ms between visual stimulation of the rubber hand and tactile stimulation to the subject's own hand is preferable to induce strong sensation of RHI. We suggest that the time window of less than 300 ms is critical for multi-sensory integration processes constituting the self-body image."

https://openalex.org/W2116820101,"Variability in resource use defines the width of a trophic niche occupied by a population. Intra-population variability in resource use may occur across hierarchical levels of population structure from individuals to subpopulations. Understanding how levels of population organization contribute to population niche width is critical to ecology and evolution. Here we describe a hierarchical stable isotope mixing model that can simultaneously estimate both the prey composition of a consumer diet and the diet variability among individuals and across levels of population organization. By explicitly estimating variance components for multiple scales, the model can deconstruct the niche width of a consumer population into relevant levels of population structure. We apply this new approach to stable isotope data from a population of gray wolves from coastal British Columbia, and show support for extensive intra-population niche variability among individuals, social groups, and geographically isolated subpopulations. The analytic method we describe improves mixing models by accounting for diet variability, and improves isotope niche width analysis by quantitatively assessing the contribution of levels of organization to the niche width of a population."
https://openalex.org/W2043141280,"Mapping the Neuronal Map In vertebrates, sensory information is topographically represented as a neural map in the brain. How is the neural map formed in the brain? Nearly a half-century ago, Roger Sperry proposed the “chemoaffinity” model, in which the positional cues on the target determine the axonal projection site, thereby establishing the topographic neural map. However, molecular mechanisms of topographic map formation remain controversial. Imai et al. (p. 585 , published online 9 July; see the Perspective by Miyamichi and Luo ) now report that the topographic map is formed by axon-axon interactions before the axons reach the target. In the mouse olfactory system, the topography of the map is determined by the relative expression levels of a guidance receptor, Neuropilin-1, and its repulsive ligand, Semaphorin-3A, expressed in axons. Topographic organization occurs even in the absence of the target, the olfactory bulb. These findings require that Sperry's model, which suggests that only the targets determine the topography of neural maps, needs to be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W2045965401,"Paradoxical Pain After Opioid Withdrawal Opioids are widely used both by pain patients and substance abusers. Withdrawal from opioids can be complicated by opioid-induced hyperalgesia, a paradoxical amplification of pain by opioids. Drdla et al. (p. 207 ) detected a novel cellular opioid action that may help to explain this paradoxical pain: the induction of synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in pain pathways by opioids. In vitro and in vivo µ-opioid receptor agonist withdrawal induced robust LTP at synapses of nociceptive C fibers. This is in contrast to the presynaptic inhibition by opioids at these synapses. Because opioidergic LTP and acute synaptic depression are spatially and mechanistically distinct, it may be possible to treat opioid-induced hyperalgesia selectively without compromising opioid analgesia."

Here, we demonstrate the potential of time-resolved, femtosecond electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) for mapping electronic structural changes in the course of nuclear motions. For graphite, it is found that changes of milli-electron volts in the energy range of up to 50 electron volts reveal the compression and expansion of layers on the subpicometer scale (for surface and bulk atoms). These nonequilibrium structural features are correlated with the direction of change from sp2 [two-dimensional (2D) graphene] to sp3 (3D-diamond) electronic hybridization, and the results are compared with theoretical charge-density calculations. The reported femtosecond time resolution of four-dimensional (4D) electron microscopy represents an advance of 10 orders of magnitude over that of conventional EELS methods."

The oxygen-sensing component of the HIF system is provided by oxygenases that catalyze the post-translational hydroxylation of the HIF α-subunit. HIF-α prolyl-hydroxylation signals for proteasomal degradation, whereas asparaginyl hydroxylation reduces HIF activity by blocking interaction of the HIF-1α C-terminal activation domain (C-TAD) with the cysteine histidine-rich domain 1 (CH1) of p300/TAZ1 (transcription adaptor zinc-binding domain) domain of CBP (2Freedman S.J.

Evidence for this proposal came from the demonstration that a C-TAD-derived peptide reduces HIF activity in cells and attenuated tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model (5Kung A.L. Wang S. Klco J.M. Kaelin W.G. Livingston D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Kung et al. (6Kung A.L. Zabludoff S.D. France D.S. Freedman S.J. Tanner E.A.

In addition to effectively reducing HIF-dependent transcription, chetomin also radiosensitizes hypoxic HT 1080 human fibrosarcoma cells (7Staab A. Loeffler J. Said H.M. Diehlmann D. Katzer A.

Chetomin is one of the epidithiodiketopiperazine (ETP) family of fungal secondary metabolites and was initially identified as an antibiotic. ETPs contain a unique diketopiperazine scaffold with a bridge formed by two or more sulfur atoms; the disulfide link exists in an unusual conformation that induces significant torsional strain (8Hilton S.T. Motherwell W.B. Potier P. Pradet C. Selwood D.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 2239-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Chetomin is an interesting, promising lead structure, not only because of its unusual structure but because it is a rare example of a small molecule that disrupts a specific protein-protein interaction within a signaling pathway (6Kung A.L. Zabludoff S.D. France D.S. Freedman S.J. Tanner E.A. Vieira A. Cornell-Kennon S. Lee J. Wang B. Wang J. Memmert K. Naegeli H.U. Petersen F. Eck M.J. Bair K.W. Wood A.W. Livingston D.M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar); there is also evidence that reduced forms of ETPs are selectively trapped in cells, a property that may be used to target hypoxic tumor cells (9Bernardo P.H. Brasch N. Chai C.L. Waring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46549-46555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism(s) of action of chetomin, and other ETPs, are unclear. Recent attention has focused on the anticancer properties of ETPs. Many naturally occurring ETPs exert anticancer and other biological activities (for review, see Ref. 10Chai C.L. Waring P. Redox. Rep. 2000; 5: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Gliotoxin (2) is reported to inhibit farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase (11Vigushin D.M. Mirsaidi N. Brooke G. Sun C. Pace P. Inman L. Moody C.J. Coombes R.C. Med. Oncol. 2004; 21: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and chaetocin (3) was reported recently to inhibit a histone methyl transferase (12Greiner D. Bonaldi T. Eskeland R. Roemer E. Imhof A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Chaetocin has also been shown to possess antimyeloma activity and is selective in killing myeloma cells over healthy cells (13Isham C.R. Tibodeau J.D. Jin W. Xu R. Timm M.M. Bible K.C. Blood. 2007; 109: 2579-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Despite the promising anticancer properties found thus far, there has been a longstanding lack of structure-activity relationship or data on the mechanism of action between ETPs and specific biological targets, in part because ETPs have historically been difficult to synthesize. Here we describe the synthesis, via a three-component procedure, of a set of ETP molecules that we used to carry out structure-activity analyses with the HIF-1α-C-TAD-p300-CH1 interaction. Unexpectedly, the work with isolated proteins and cells reveals that the ETP disulfide core of the complex chetomin structure is itself sufficient for activity and that the mechanism of action involves disruption of the zinc-binding sites in the CH1 domain of p300. Although the zinc sites in p300 are known to be important for CH1 structure and binding of HIF-1α, they had not previously been recognized as a specific target for chetomin. To our knowledge, no other drug has been known to target this zinc interaction. For full experimental details, see supplemental information. All reactions requiring the use of dry conditions were carried out under an atmosphere of nitrogen, and all glassware was predried in an oven (110 °C) or flame-dried and cooled under nitrogen prior to use. Stirring was by internal magnetic follower unless otherwise stated. All reactions were followed by TLC, and organic phases extracted were dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Melting points were determined on a Gallenkamp melting point apparatus. Infrared spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 1605 FT-IR spectrophotometer using NaCl plates. 1H NMR (J values are reported to the nearest 0.5 Hz) and 13C NMR were recorded either on a Bruker AMX300 spectrometer or on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer.

HCT 116 colorectal carcinoma cells were grown in McCoy's 5a medium modified supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm), and Hep G2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm), at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. For hypoxic experiments, cells were placed in a modular incubator chamber flushed with 1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2. HCT 116 cells were seeded overnight into white 96-well plates in 100 μl of medium at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells well−1, and Hep G2 cells were plated in the same manner at a concentration of 8 × 104 cells well−1. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, medium was removed and replaced with 200 μl of medium containing either drug or vehicle control. Plates were placed in either a normoxic incubator or a hypoxic chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) for 18 h. 100 μl of medium were removed for VEGF measurement, and cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Blue cell viability reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the viability assessment in the presence of zinc, after the initial overnight incubation of cells at 37 °C, medium was removed and replaced with 100 μl of medium containing 150 μm ZnSO4 or ZnCl2. Cells were returned to 37 °C incubator for ∼90 min before adding 100 μl of medium containing 2× final concentration of drug or vehicle control. The final concentration of Zn2+ for incubation with ETPs was 75 μm. The viability assessment was carried out the same as for non-zinc-treated cells. After viability readings were recorded, 20 μl of culture media containing 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine were added to the cells, and they were placed back in the 37 °C incubator for 18–24 h. Proliferation was measured using the cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, bromodeoxyuridine (colorimetric) (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tissue culture supernatant levels of VEGF were determined using a VEGF immunoassay (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After purification of GST-CH1323–423, the GST tag was removed by treatment with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) treatment as specified by the manufacturer. CH1 was purified by size exclusion chromatography using a 300-ml Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). As purified, CH1 was a mixture of apo and zinc complexes. To produce the fully tri-metallated form, CH1 was treated with 3 eq of Zn(II) and an excess of DTT. p300-CH1323–423 protein (GST tag-removed CH1, as described above) was desalted using a Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad) into 15 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 20 μm. An aqueous solution of ZnSO4 · 7H2O (100 mm) was then diluted with MilliQ water to a final working concentrations of 100 μm. DTT was dissolved in MilliQ water at a concentration of 1 mm. ETPs were dissolved in DMSO (10 mm) and then diluted with ammonium acetate (15 mm, pH 7.5) to a concentration of 100 μm. The p300 protein (1.25 μl) was mixed with 3 eq of Zn(II) (0.75 μl), 20 eq of DTT (0.5 μl), and 20 eq of ETP (5 μl) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis. Data were acquired using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF micro, Micromass, Altrincham) interfaced with a Nanomate (Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY) with a chip voltage of 1.70 kV and a delivery pressure 0.25 p.s.i. (1 p.s.i. = 6.81 kilopascals). The sample cone voltage was typically 200 V with a source temperature of 40 °C and with an acquisition/scan time of 10 s/1 s. Calibration and sample acquisition were performed in the positive ion mode in the range of 200–5,000 m/z. The pressure at the interface between the atmospheric source and the high vacuum region was fixed at 6.60 mbar. External instrument calibration was achieved by using sodium iodide. Data were processed with MASSLYNX 4.0 (Waters). ETPs were stored frozen in DMSO. Chetomin and gliotoxin were purchased from Calbiochem; chaetocin was purchased from Sigma. Deacetylsirodesmin PL was a kind gift from Soledade Petras (University of Saskatchewan). Graphing was done using Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad) for curves, and IC50 determinations were generated from built-in functions. Molecular modeling was performed in PyMOL version 99 (20DeLano W.L.

(6Kung A.L. Zabludoff S.D. France D.S. Freedman S.J. Tanner E.A. Vieira A. Cornell-Kennon S. Lee J. Wang B. Wang J. Memmert K. Naegeli H.U. Petersen F. Eck M.J. Bair K.W. Wood A.W. Livingston D.M.

The assay was verified by demonstration of competitive inhibition by the addition of His6-labeled HIF-1α-C-TAD775–826 (reported Kd of 123 nm (21Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Kung A.L. France D.S. Wagner G.

As work with isolated proteins uses much higher levels of protein than those found in a cellular environment, in vitro IC50 values do not necessarily correspond to IC50 values in cellular studies. Because of the biological activities associated with ETPs (10Chai C.L. Waring P. Redox. Rep. 2000; 5: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Gardiner D.M. Waring P. Howlett B.J. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), we then tested other naturally occurring ETPs, gliotoxin (2), chaetocin (3), and deacetylsirodesmin PL (4), as C-TAD-CH1-binding inhibitors. Unexpectedly, given the structural differences between these compounds and chetomin, all these ETPs effectively inhibited binding similarly to chetomin, blocking more than 98.9% of CH1-C-TAD binding at the given concentrations (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the ETP core itself is central to the observed activity. To test this hypothesis, we developed synthetic methodology employing tandem three-component reactions to give ETPs in an efficient four-step route (23Aliev A.E. Hilton S.T. Motherwell W.B. Selwood D.L. Tetrahedron Lett. 2006; 47: 2387-2390Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). This method enabled us to synthesize a set of ETPs, 5 to 9 (Fig. 3B) in which substituents on the diketopiperazine ring were varied. As with the complex natural ETPs, the synthetic ETPs disrupted C-TAD and CH1 binding with IC50 values for the synthetic ETPs ranging from ∼6.4 to 52.3 μm (Fig. 3C, and see supplemental information for inhibition curves and IC50 values). As shown in Fig. 3C, at 62.5 μm, more than 95.7% of CH1-C-TAD binding was blocked. These results are important because they imply that a simple ETP core structure is sufficient to ablate the very tight binding between the C-TAD and CH1 domains. We then investigated the role of the ETP dithiol/disulfide group by preparing a dithiol analogue (10), an analogue containing one thiol (11), and an analogue with methylated thiols (12) (Fig. 4A) (24Jiang H. Newcombe N. Sutton P. Lin Q.H. Mullbacher A. Waring P. Aust. J. Chem. 1993; 46: 1743-1754Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Fukuyama T. Nakatsuka S.I. Kishi Y.

Perkin Trans. 1986; 1: 109-116Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The monothiodiketopiperazine (11) was obtained using a modification of the three-component approach used for ETP preparation (27Hilton S. Motherwell W. Selwood D. Synlett. 2004; : 2609-2611Google Scholar). Except for 10, which blocked 97.8% of binding at 62.5 μm and likely underwent some disulfide formation under the aerobic reaction conditions, these compounds were completely inactive (Fig. 4B), revealing that a dithiol/disulfide is necessary for activity. The lack of activity of a disulfide-linked depsipeptide provides evidence for the requirement of a disulfide bridged/dithiol diketopiperazine for activity. Because assays with HIF-1α and HIF-binding proteins (the HIF hydroxylases) have shown that binding affinities can vary significantly with the length of the HIF fragment (28Dames S.A.

Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we tested whether the ETP compounds could prevent CH1 from binding to full-length HIF-1α. A co-immunoprecipitation assay using full-length HIF-1α and p300-CH1 demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition with both the natural and the synthetic ETPs (Fig. 4C, and see supplemental information for the entire range of compounds) as seen in the in vitro C-TAD-CH1 assay. However, compound 9, which was slightly less active than the other ETPs in the in vitro fluorescence assay (although not to statistical significance), failed to block CH1 binding to full-length HIF-1α at the same concentration as the other ETPs. This indicates that appropriate modifications can lead to a decrease in activity and that selectivity of ETPs might be achieved (Fig. 4C). The molecular mechanism of action of the ETPs was then investigated by using non-denaturing ESI-MS to analyze ETP-induced modifications. We did not observe ETP-mediated modification of the C-TAD under our conditions (although it contains a cysteine (Cys800)). In contrast, we observed striking effects on p300-CH1 upon ETP treatment. Upon treatment of CH1 with an excess of the natural ETPs (chetomin, chaetocin, gliotoxin, and deacetylsirodesmin PL), complete zinc ion release was observed from CH1. The results with chetomin and chaetocin were complex, probably because they contain two ETP cores, so we carried out further investigations with gliotoxin, which contains a single ETP core. When CH1 was treated with gliotoxin (5 eq), partial zinc ejection was observed (CH1·Zn-CH1·Zn2:CH1·Zn3 in an ∼1:3:4 ratio, respectively). In the presence of 10 eq of gliotoxin, the two main species observed were apo CH1 and CH1·Zn, in an ∼1:1 ratio. With 20 eq of gliotoxin, complete release of zinc gave apo CH1 as the only observed species (Fig. 5A). Next we screened the synthetic ETPs for zinc ejection activity. Interestingly, and consistent with the structure-activity relationship studies, the results showed that 6, 7, and 10 caused partial zinc release (yielding apo CH1 and all three metallated species). In contrast, the monothiol (11) and thioether (12) analogues, all of which were inactive in the binding assays, did not cause zinc release, demonstrating that a dithiol/disulfide ETP core is essential for the activity (Fig. 5B). These results reveal that the ETP disulfide core structure is both sufficient and, within the set of tested compounds, necessary for inhibition of the HIF-1α-CH1 interaction. The mechanism of action involving modification of the zinc-binding sites on CH1 domain of p300 is supported by observations, employing NMR studies, that CH1 becomes less structured in the presence of chetomin (6Kung A.L. Zabludoff S.D. France D.S. Freedman S.J. Tanner E.A. Vieira A. Cornell-Kennon S. Lee J. Wang B. Wang J. Memmert K. Naegeli H.U. Petersen F. Eck M.J. Bair K.W. Wood A.W. Livingston D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2157485244,"Immature ovarian primordial follicles are essential for maintenance of the reproductive lifespan of female mammals. Recently, it was found that overactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in oocytes of primordial follicles by an oocyte-specific deletion of Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten), the gene encoding PI3K negative regulator PTEN, results in premature activation of the entire pool of primordial follicles, indicating that activation of the PI3K pathway in oocytes is important for control of follicular activation. To investigate whether PI3K signaling in oocytes of primary and further developed follicles also plays a role at later stages in follicular development and ovulation, we conditionally deleted the Pten gene from oocytes of primary and further developed follicles by using transgenic mice expressing zona pellucida 3 (Zp3) promoter-mediated Cre recombinase. Our results show that Pten was efficiently deleted from oocytes of primary and further developed follicles, as indicated by the elevated phosphorylation of the major PI3K downstream component Akt. However, follicular development was not altered and oocyte maturation was also normal, which led to normal fertility with unaltered litter size in the mutant mice. Our data indicate that properly controlled PTEN/PI3K-Akt signaling in oocytes is essential for control of the development of primordial follicles whereas overactivation of PI3K signaling in oocytes does not appear to affect the development of growing follicles. This suggests that there is a stage-specific function of PTEN/PI3K signaling in mouse oocytes that controls follicular activation."

Surprisingly, the tremor episodes have persisted, rather than decaying after the quakes, which may imply that there has been a step change in the state of stress on this part of the San Andreas Fault."
https://openalex.org/W2165584097,"The cohesin protein complex was first recognized for holding sister chromatids together and ensuring proper chromosome segregation. Cohesin also regulates gene expression, but the mechanisms are unknown. Cohesin associates preferentially with active genes, and is generally absent from regions in which histone H3 is methylated by the Enhancer of zeste [E(z)] Polycomb group silencing protein. Here we show that transcription is hypersensitive to cohesin levels in two exceptional cases where cohesin and the E(z)-mediated histone methylation simultaneously coat the entire Enhancer of split and invected-engrailed gene complexes in cells derived from Drosophila central nervous system. These gene complexes are modestly transcribed, and produce seven of the twelve transcripts that increase the most with cohesin knockdown genome-wide. Cohesin mutations alter eye development in the same manner as increased Enhancer of split activity, suggesting that similar regulation occurs in vivo. We propose that cohesin helps restrain transcription of these gene complexes, and that deregulation of similarly cohesin-hypersensitive genes may underlie developmental deficits in Cornelia de Lange syndrome."

We discuss how this observed tyrosine loss correlates with the expansion of tyrosine kinases in the evolution of the metazoan lineage and how it may relate to the optimization of signaling systems in multicellular animals. We propose that this phenomenon illustrates genome-wide adaptive evolution to accommodate beneficial genetic perturbation."

Interestingly, both FANCI and FANCD2 have been shown to localize near BLM helicase foci at mitotic anaphase bridges. Anaphase bridges of interwound DNA between sister chromatids are thought to indicate unreplicated DNA or aberrant replication intermediates that persist into anaphase (22.Chan K.L. Palmai-Pallag T.

Furthermore, using the FANCI K523R mutant, ablated for the known cellular ubiquitin acceptor site, we have furnished evidence that monoubiquitination in vitro occurs mostly on Lys-523 in FANCI. Establishing this minimal in vitro ubiquitination system sets the stage for asking how the other FA core complex components and protein phosphorylation (see below) affect the efficiency of the ubiquitination reaction.We note that in human cells, the FANCI K523R mutant is defective in DNA damage focus formation, and in addition, has been reported to assert a dominant negative effect on FANCD2 monoubiquitination and DNA damage-induced FANCD2 focus assembly (11.Smogorzewska A.

However, in chicken DT40 cells genetically ablated for endogenous FANCI, expression of the K525R mutant (equivalent to the human FANCI K523R mutant) lacking the ubiquitin acceptor site can significantly restore cellular resistance to the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C and some FANCD2 chromatin recruitment (14.Ishiai M.

Additional studies are clearly needed to determine the relative importance of FANCI monoubiquitination in the activation of the FA DNA repair pathway in mammalian versus non-mammalian cells.Both FANCD2 and FANCI are subject to phosphorylation by the DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATR. Mutation of the ATR phosphorylation sites Thr-691 and Ser-717 in FANCD2 compromises its monoubiquitination and sensitizes cells to DNA cross-linking agents (27.Ho G.P. Margossian S. Taniguchi T. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7005-7015Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the phosphorylation status of FANCI is decisive for FANCD2 monoubiquitination and also DNA damage resistance in the chicken DT40 cell line (14.Ishiai M. Kitao H. Smogorzewska A.

In DT40 cells, phosphomimic mutations of a conserved cluster of ATR phosphorylation consensus (S/T)Q motifs surrounding the Lys-525 monoubiquitination acceptor site of FANCI act as a “switch” for constitutive FANCD2 monoubiquitination and chromatin localization of FANCI and FANCD2. Nevertheless, the FANCI phosphorylation switch is not sufficient to promote colocalization of FANCD2/FANCI with other DNA repair factors, e.g. RAD51 (14.Ishiai M. Kitao H. Smogorzewska A. Tomida J. Kinomura A. Uchida E. Saberi A. Kinoshita E. Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Koike T. Tashiro S. Elledge S.J. Takata M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).The discovery and characterization of a deubiquitinating enzyme, USP1, specific for FANCD2, has revealed the additional importance of FANCD2 deubiquitination for DNA damage repair (28.Nijman S.M.

USP1-deficient cells exhibit an elevated sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents (29.Oestergaard V.H. Langevin F. Kuiken H.J. Pace P. Niedzwiedz W. Simpson L.J. Ohzeki M. Takata M. Sale J.E.

That USP1 is similarly involved in the deubiquitination and regulation of FANCI seems likely. The establishment of in vitro FANCD2 and FANCI ubiquitination systems (Ref. 10.Alpi A.F. Pace P.E.

FA cells exhibit exquisite sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and marked genomic instability, indicative of a failure to repair damaged DNA (1.Poll E.H. Arwert F. Joenje H. Wanamarta A.H. Hum.

Thirteen FA proteins have been identified, of which eight, FANC-A, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L, and -M, form part of a nuclear core complex that is required to monoubiquitinate two other FA proteins, FANCD2 and FANCI. When monoubiquitinated, FANCD2 and FANCI become chromatin-associated in foci that contain various factors, including the RAD51 recombinase BRCA2 (also known as FANCD1) and PALB2 (also called FANCN), which mediate DNA repair via RAD51-catalyzed homologous recombination (4.Wang W.

Monoubiquitination of FANCD2 appears to be a key event for proper repair of exogenous DNA damage but also occurs during an unperturbed S phase, likely in response to stalled replication forks (4.Wang W.

Babu M.M. Patel K.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). FANCI was identified recently as a target protein for the ATM/ATR kinase. FANCI is also monoubiquitinated, in a manner that is dependent on the FA core complex (11.Smogorzewska A. Matsuoka S. Vinciguerra P. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P.

Moreover, the amount and monoubiquitination of these two FA proteins are co-dependent in human cells, i.e. the quantity and monoubiquitination of FANCD2 are diminished in FANCI-deficient cells and vice versa (11.Smogorzewska A.

These observations suggest that FANCI and FANCD2 form a complex integral to cellular DNA repair capacity.

Herein, we document studies that reveal several biochemical attributes of FANCI, including DNA binding, and its monoubiquitination, that are relevant for understanding the biological role of this key FA protein. DiscussionWe have found a DNA binding activity in FANCI that has preference for branched structures and have provided evidence that the C-terminal region of FANCI (amino acids 985–1328) is sufficient for DNA binding. Notably, several disease-causing mutations of FANCI map to the C-terminal region within the DNA binding domain that we have identified (11.Smogorzewska A. Matsuoka S. Vinciguerra P.

D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7005-7015Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the phosphorylation status of FANCI is decisive for FANCD2 monoubiquitination and also DNA damage resistance in the chicken DT40 cell line (14.Ishiai M. Kitao H. Smogorzewska A. Tomida J. Kinomura A. Uchida E. Saberi A. Kinoshita E. Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Koike T. Tashiro S. Elledge S.J. Takata M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In DT40 cells, phosphomimic mutations of a conserved cluster of ATR phosphorylation consensus (S/T)Q motifs surrounding the Lys-525 monoubiquitination acceptor site of FANCI act as a “switch” for constitutive FANCD2 monoubiquitination and chromatin localization of FANCI and FANCD2. Nevertheless, the FANCI phosphorylation switch is not sufficient to promote colocalization of FANCD2/FANCI with other DNA repair factors, e.g. RAD51 (14.Ishiai M. Kitao H. Smogorzewska A. Tomida J. Kinomura A. Uchida E. Saberi A. Kinoshita E. Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Koike T. Tashiro S. Elledge S.J. Takata M. Nat. Struct. Mol.

USP1-deficient cells exhibit an elevated sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents (29.Oestergaard V.H. Langevin F. Kuiken H.J. Pace P. Niedzwiedz W. Simpson L.J. Ohzeki M. Takata M. Sale J.E.

That USP1 is similarly involved in the deubiquitination and regulation of FANCI seems likely. The establishment of in vitro FANCD2 and FANCI ubiquitination systems (Ref. 10.Alpi A.F. Pace P.E.

We have found a DNA binding activity in FANCI that has preference for branched structures and have provided evidence that the C-terminal region of FANCI (amino acids 985–1328) is sufficient for DNA binding. Notably, several disease-causing mutations of FANCI map to the C-terminal region within the DNA binding domain that we have identified (11.Smogorzewska A. Matsuoka S. Vinciguerra P.

FANCI forms a dimeric complex (the ID complex) with FANCD2 (11.Smogorzewska A. Matsuoka S. Vinciguerra P. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P. Hofmann K. D'Andrea A.D.

Upon DNA damage, FANCD2 and FANCI are dependent upon one another for relocalization to chromatin at DNA repair foci (11.Smogorzewska A. Matsuoka S. Vinciguerra P. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J.

Biol. 2008; 15: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As such, FANCI and FANCD2 are likely to perform their DNA repair functions together and in a manner that requires the DNA binding activity of the ID complex. Current evidence suggests that the ID complex plays an early role in DNA repair, prior to homologous recombination or translesion synthesis (19.Gurtan A.M. D'Andrea A.D. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20.Niedernhofer L.J. Lalai A.S. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 2005; 123: 1191-1198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The branched DNA structures that FANCI preferentially binds in vitro resemble intermediates that arise when a replication fork encounters a blocking lesion (20.Niedernhofer L.J. Lalai A.S. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 2005; 123: 1191-1198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 21.Räschle M. Knipscheer P. Enoiu M. Angelov T. Sun J. Griffith J.D. Ellenberger T.E. Schärer O.D. Walter J.C. Cell. 2008; 134: 969-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The ID complex could be involved in the recognition of blocked forks and/or blocked forks that have been processed into four-branched structures resembling HJ recombination intermediates. Once engaged at these structures, the ID complex may help to mediate the DNA repair process by recruiting factors, such as homologous recombination proteins (e.g. BRCA2, PALB2, and RAD51) and/or components of translesion DNA synthesis machinery (e.g. REV1), that perform repair or replicative bypass. Interestingly, both FANCI and FANCD2 have been shown to localize near BLM helicase foci at mitotic anaphase bridges. Anaphase bridges of interwound DNA between sister chromatids are thought to indicate unreplicated DNA or aberrant replication intermediates that persist into anaphase (22.Chan K.L. Palmai-Pallag T. Ying S. Hickson I.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 23.Naim V. Rosselli F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The FA core complex is required for BLM recruitment to these foci (23.Naim V. Rosselli F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). BLM functions with topoisomerase IIIα and other partner proteins to process branched DNA structures, including the double Holliday junction, into non-crossover products (24.Raynard S. Bussen W. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13861-13864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the idea that ID complex binding to branched DNA structures, such as blocked replication forks, aids in BLM recruitment to process these structures. In human cells, retention of FANCD2 and FANCI in DNA repair foci requires their monoubiquitination (11.Smogorzewska A. Matsuoka S. Vinciguerra P. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P. Hofmann K. D'Andrea A.D. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2007; 129: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 25.Wang W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), implicating a chromatin-bound ubiquitin receptor that serves to anchor the ID complex in chromatin. Monoubiquitination of the ID complex may also enhance its ability to mediate the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to the damage site (26.Wang X. Andreassen P.R. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5850-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Consistent with genetic data implicating the FANCL-containing FA core complex in FANCI monoubiquitination (11.Smogorzewska A. Matsuoka S. Vinciguerra P. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P. Hofmann K. D'Andrea A.D. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2007; 129: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) and the recent demonstration of in vitro UBE2T-FANCL-catalyzed FANCD2 monoubiquitination (10.Alpi A.F. Pace P.E. Babu M.M. Patel K.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we have found that FANCI serves as a substrate for the UBE2T-FANCL pair. Furthermore, using the FANCI K523R mutant, ablated for the known cellular ubiquitin acceptor site, we have furnished evidence that monoubiquitination in vitro occurs mostly on Lys-523 in FANCI. Establishing this minimal in vitro ubiquitination system sets the stage for asking how the other FA core complex components and protein phosphorylation (see below) affect the efficiency of the ubiquitination reaction. We note that in human cells, the FANCI K523R mutant is defective in DNA damage focus formation, and in addition, has been reported to assert a dominant negative effect on FANCD2 monoubiquitination and DNA damage-induced FANCD2 focus assembly (11.Smogorzewska A. Matsuoka S. Vinciguerra P. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P. Hofmann K. D'Andrea A.D. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2007; 129: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). However, in chicken DT40 cells genetically ablated for endogenous FANCI, expression of the K525R mutant (equivalent to the human FANCI K523R mutant) lacking the ubiquitin acceptor site can significantly restore cellular resistance to the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C and some FANCD2 chromatin recruitment (14.Ishiai M. Kitao H. Smogorzewska A. Tomida J. Kinomura A. Uchida E. Saberi A. Kinoshita E. Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Koike T. Tashiro S. Elledge S.J. Takata M. Nat. Struct. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2043485218,"Coilin is the signature protein of the Cajal body, a conserved nuclear organelle involved in multiple aspects of small ribonucleoprotein (RNP) biogenesis. Coilin is required for Cajal body homeostasis in both plants and animals. Mice lacking coilin are viable when the mutation is crossed to an outbred strain but only partially viable when crossed to inbred lines.In order to clarify this issue, we backcrossed the coilin deletion onto the C57BL6/J background for ten generations and then investigated the consequences of coilin removal on overall viability and reproductive success. We conclude that semi-lethal phenotype observed in mixed-background crosses is due to loss of the Coilin gene (or a very tightly-linked locus). Interestingly, coilin knockout embryos die relatively late in gestation, between E13.5 and birth. We show that the maternal contribution of coilin is not important for organismal viability. Importantly, coilin knockout mice display significant fertility and fecundity defects. Mutant males that escape the embryonic lethality display reduced testis size, however, both males and females contribute to the observed reduction in reproductive fitness.The evolutionary conservation of coilin from plants to animals suggests that the protein plays an important role, perhaps coordinating the activities of various RNA-processing machineries. Our observations are consistent with the idea that coilin functions to ensure robust organismal development, especially during periods of rapid growth."
https://openalex.org/W2103672763,"We have identified, purified, and characterized three subcomplexes of PA700, the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome. These subcomplexes (denoted PS-1, PS-2, and PS-3) collectively account for all subunits present in purified PA700 but contain no overlapping components or significant levels of non-PA700 proteins. Each subcomplex contained two of the six AAA subunits (Rpt1–6) that form the binding interface of PA700 with the 20 S proteasome, the protease component of the 26 S proteasome. Unlike intact PA700, no individual PA700 subcomplex displayed ATPase activity or proteasome activating activity. However, both activities were manifested by ATP-dependent in vitro reconstitution of PA700 from the subcomplexes. We exploited functional reconstitution to define and distinguish roles of different PA700 subunits in PA700 function by selective alteration of subunits within individual subcomplexes prior to reconstitution. Carboxypeptidase treatment of either PS-2 or PS-3, subcomplexes containing specific Rpt subunits previously shown to have important roles in 26 S proteasome assembly and activation, inhibited these processes but did not affect PA700 reconstitution or ATPase activity. Thus, the intact C termini of both subunits are required for 26 S proteasome assembly and activation but not for PA700 reconstitution. Surprisingly, carboxypeptidase treatment of PS-1 also inhibited 26 S proteasome assembly and activation upon reconstitution with untreated PS-2 and PS-3.

ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin carboxypeptidase A arbitrary fluorescent units adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) succinyl. Recently, specific interactions between Rpt and α subunits that determine PA700-20 S proteasome binding and gate opening have been defined. These findings established nonequivalent roles among the six different Rpt subunits for these processes (12Smith D.M. Chang S.C. Park S. Finley D. Cheng Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol.

For example, carboxypeptidase A treatment of PA700 selectively cleaves the C termini of two Rpt subunits (Rpt2 and Rpt5) and renders PA700 incompetent for proteasome binding and activation (19Gillette T.G. Kumar B. Thompson D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31813-31822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Remarkably, short peptides corresponding to the C terminus of either Rpt2 or Rpt5, but none of the other Rpt subunits, were sufficient to bind to the 20 S proteasome and activate peptide substrate hydrolysis by inducing gate opening (12Smith D.M.

Cell. 2005; 20: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The C-terminal peptides of Rpt2 and Rpt5 appear to bind to different and distinct sites on the proteasome and produce additive effects on rates of peptide substrate hydrolysis, suggesting that pore size or another feature of gating can be variably modulated (19Gillette T.G. Kumar B. Thompson D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31813-31822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These various results, however, do not specify whether the action of one or the other or both C-terminal peptides is essential for function of intact PA700. In addition to its role in activation, PA700 plays other essential roles in 26 S proteasome function related to substrate selection and processing. For example, PA700 captures polyubiquitylated proteins via multiple subunits that bind polyubiquitin chains (21Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Husnjak K. Elsasser S. Zhang N. Chen X. Randles L. Shi Y. Hofmann K. Walters K.J. Finley D. Dikic I.

Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Moreover, to ensure translocation of the bound ubiquitylated protein through the narrow opened substrate access pore for proteolysis, PA700 destabilizes the tertiary structure of the protein via chaperone-like activity and removes polyubiquitin chains via deubiquitylating activities of several different subunits (24Liu C.W.

These various functions appear to be highly coordinated and may be mechanistically linked to one another and to the hydrolysis of ATP by Rpt subunits during substrate processing. Despite support for this general model of PA700 action, there is a lack of detailed knowledge about how PA700 subunits are structurally organized and functionally linked. Previously, we identified and characterized a subcomplex of PA700 called “modulator” that contained two ATPase subunits, Rpt4 and Rpt5, and one non-ATPase subunit, p27 (31DeMartino G.N. Proske R.J.

Although this protein was identified by an assay that measured increased PA700-dependent proteasome activation, the mechanistic basis of this effect was not clear. Moreover, the modulator lacked detectable ATPase activity and proteasome activating activity. The latter feature is surprising in retrospect because of the newly identified capacity of Rpt5 to activate the proteasome directly (12Smith D.M. Chang S.C. Park S. Finley D. Cheng Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 19Gillette T.G. Kumar B. Thompson D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol.

This disparity suggests that specific interactions among multiple PA700 subunits determine the manifestation and regulation of various activities. This study extends our recent findings regarding relative roles of Rpt subunits in the regulation of proteasome function. It also provides new insights and significance to older work that identified and characterized the modulator as a subcomplex of PA700. Our findings unite two different lines of investigation to offer new information about the structure, function, and regulation of 26 S proteasome. They also offer insights about alternative models for assembly of PA700 and 26 S proteasome in intact cells. 20 S proteasome and PA700 were purified from bovine red blood cells as described previously (11Ma C.-P.

PA700 subcomplexes PS-1, PS-2, and PS-3 were purified by variations of the PA700 purification, as described in detail below. Soluble lysates of bovine red blood cells were prepared as for purification of PA700 and subjected to gel filtration column chromatography on Sephacryl S-300, as described previously (32DeMartino G.N. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Column fractions containing peak activity of PA700 were pooled and subjected to ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Fractogel (2.5 × 9-cm column) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol and eluted with the same buffer with a linear gradient of NaCl (100–400 mm). PA700-containing fractions were identified by functional assays for the activation of 20 S proteasome-catalyzed hydrolysis of Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, as described below, and by identification of the characteristic component subunits by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. PA700 eluted at a NaCl concentration of ∼300 mm. PS-1 was identified as a subset of PA700 proteins with coincident distribution profiles that eluted at a NaCl concentration of ∼200–250 mm but were devoid of proteasome activating activity. These fractions were pooled, concentrated, and re-chromatographed on the Sephacryl S-300 column (120 × 5 cm) in buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol. PS-1 was identified by Western blotting against select PA700 subunits and by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE of column fractions. PS-1-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, applied to a column of hydroxylapatite (7 × 2.5 cm), and eluted with a linear gradient (5–200 mm) of phosphate buffer. Fractions containing characteristic PA700 subunits, as detected by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting against select PA700 subunits, were pooled and concentrated. If additional purification was required, PS-1 was subjected to glycerol density gradient centrifugation (12.5–37.5% glycerol) as described previously (15Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Purified samples of PS-1 were concentrated to greater than 1 mg/ml, dialyzed extensively against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C until use. PS-2 was purified from the extract of bovine red blood cells that remained soluble after treatment with 40% saturated ammonium sulfate. Additional solid ammonium sulfate was added to this fraction to achieve 80% saturation. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation, redissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, dialyzed extensively against the same buffer, concentrated, and subjected to gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300. The column was equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. Column fractions were assayed for PA700 activity and subjected to Western blotting for Rpt1, Rpt2, and other selected PA700 subunits. Fractions containing Rpt1 and Rpt2, but no PA700 activity, were pooled, applied to a DEAE-Fractogel column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and eluted with a linear gradient of 100–450 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing Rpt1 and Rpt2 as detected by Western blotting, were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and subjected to a second round of ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Fractogel using an elution gradient of 100–350 mm NaCl. Column fractions containing PS-2 were identified by Coomassie Blue staining and by Western blotting for component proteins. If additional purification was required, PS-2-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to glycerol density gradient centrifugation as described above for PS-1. Purified samples of PS-2 were concentrated to greater than 1 mg/ml, dialyzed extensively against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C until use. PS-3, formerly termed modulator, was purified from bovine red blood cells, as described previously (31DeMartino G.N. Proske R.J. Moomaw C.R. Strong A.A. Song X. Hisamatsu H. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3112-3118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Proteasome activity was measured by determining rates of enzymatic cleavage of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) from peptide substrates Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, Suc-Leu-Leu-Glu-AMC, and carbobenzoxy-Val-Leu-Arg-AMC, as described previously (11Ma C.-P.

Acta. 1986; 873: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Standard assay conditions included 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2–1.0 μg of latent 20 S proteasome, and 50 μm substrate in a volume of 200 μl. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 10 or 20 min (depending on the experiment) in a Biotek FL600 fluorescence plate reader with filters at 380 nm excitation/460 nm emission. AMC fluorescence was monitored once per min during the assay and analyzed with kinetic software. Activity is expressed as arbitrary fluorescent units (AFU) produced per min. Routine control assays included reactions without proteasome. Other details of individual experiments are provided in the appropriate figure legends. In some experiments semi-quantitative measures of proteasome activity were obtained by overlay of peptide substrates in situ on proteins separated in native polyacrylamide gels, as described previously (34Elsasser S. Schmidt M. Finley D. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 10–30 min, AMC at the position of the protease responsible for its production was visualized by UV light. Activation of 20 S proteasome activity by PA700 or PA700 subcomplexes was measured by a variation of the proteasome activity assays described above. Activating proteins were preincubated with 20 S proteasome for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 50 μl. Peptide substrate (150 μl) was added, and proteasome activity was measured as described above. Routine controls included incubations in the absence of ATP and incubations lacking either 20 S proteasome or PA700. To reconstitute PA700 from PA700 subcomplexes, proteins were preincubated for 15–30 min at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 50 μl. Samples were then subjected to analysis as described in the appropriate figure or table legends of the specific experiments. ATPase and proteasome stimulating activities of reconstituted subcomplexes are not reported by specific activities on a molar basis because of incomplete reconstitution. ATPase activity was determined by two different assays, including production of [32P]phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP (35DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P. Proske R.J. Ma C.-P. Afendis S.J. Swaffield J.C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20878-20884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and colorimetric detection of phosphate using Malachite green (36Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Carboxypeptidase A (CbpA) was purchased from Sigma. CbpA was incubated with PA700 or PA700 subcomplexes (usually 0.5 milliunits of CbpA/mg of PA700 protein) at 25 °C as described previously and in figure legends for specific experiments (19Gillette T.G. Kumar B. Thompson D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31813-31822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Control experiments documented that CbpA had no direct effect on the activity of the 20 S proteasome. CbpA was inhibited by carboxypeptidase inhibitor from the potato tuber (C0279, Sigma). Glycerol density gradient centrifugation was conducted as described in detail previously (30Koulich E. Li X. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Native PAGE was conducted as described previously using 4% polyacrylamide gels (15Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Protein identification by mass spectrometry was conducted by the Protein Chemistry Core Research Facility at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Details of procedures for specific analysis are provided in the appropriate figure and table legends. We previously established a procedure for the purification of PA700 from bovine red blood cells based on a functional assay that monitors ATP-dependent activation of 20 S proteasome-catalyzed hydrolysis of peptide substrates (11Ma C.-P. Vu J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure initially isolates PA700 as a homogeneous peak of activity upon Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography of an ammonium sulfate-precipitated fraction of a soluble cell extract (supplemental Fig. 1). Subsequent ion-exchange chromatography of fractions containing this activity also produces an activity peak that is coincident with a complement of proteins characteristic of PA700 subunits, as shown by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1A). Inspection of the gel, however, revealed that some, but not all, of the PA700 subunits also eluted coincidently as a separate peak earlier than PA700 in the salt gradient. These fractions had no detectable proteasome activating activity and also contained proteins not characteristic of PA700. The same elution pattern of stained proteins was observed in multiple independent PA700 preparations, indicating that it was a reproducible feature of the method. Western blotting of selected PA700 subunits confirmed that some PA700 subunits (e.g. Rpt6) had bimodal distributions corresponding to the staining pattern described above, whereas others (e.g. Rpt2) were specific for functional PA700 (Fig. 1A). These results, as well as similar distinctions in distribution patterns of other PA700 subunits (data not shown), suggested that bovine red blood cell extracts contain a subcomplex of PA700 that lacks proteasome activating activity. We termed this putative complex PA700 Subcomplex-1 (PS-1) and sought to purify it and characterize its structure and function. To purify PS-1, fractions containing PS-1 were pooled and subjected to a second round of gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300. SDS-PAGE of eluted fractions revealed that the same set of PA700 subunits identified by ion-exchange chromatography co-eluted with an apparent molecular weight of ∼450,000, a value distinctly smaller than that of intact PA700 (Fig. 1B). Because the PS-1-containing fractions overlapped with proteins featuring distinctly different distribution profiles, we subjected PS-1 to further purification on hydroxylapatite chromatography. This procedure isolated a set of ∼11 proteins with a homogeneous distribution profile (Fig. 1C). The composition and co-distribution of this set of proteins were not altered by additional purification procedures such as gel filtration chromatography on Superose 6, glycerol density gradient centrifugation, or ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Affi-Gel Blue (Fig. 1D and data not shown). Like PA700, these proteins migrated as a single band upon native PAGE (Fig. 1E). Thus, these proteins appear to form a single, structurally stable complex. To identify the component subunits of PS-1 and compare them to those of PA700, we subjected the complex to mass spectrometry and to Western blot analysis with antibodies against representative PA700 subunits. Mass spectrometry of PS-1 identified Rpt3, Rpt6, Rpn2, Rpn3, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn8, Rpn9, Rpn10, Rpn11, Rpn12, and Uch37 but no detectable Rpn1, Rpt1, Rpt2, Rpt4, and Rpt5 (supplemental Table 1).

https://openalex.org/W2085051815,"Background The clinical and histologic appearance of fibrosis in cutaneous lesions in chronic graft-versus -host disease (c-GVHD) resembles the appearance of fibrosis in scleroderma (SSc). Recent studies identified distinctive structural changes in the superficial dermal microvasculature and matrix of SSc skin. We compared the dermal microvasculature in human c-GVHD to SSc to determine if c-GVHD is a suitable model for SSc. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed skin biopsies of normal controls (n = 24), patients with SSc (n = 30) and c-GVHD with dermal fibrosis (n = 133)). Immunostaining was employed to identify vessels, vascular smooth muscle, dermal matrix, and cell proliferation. C-GVHD and SSc had similar dermal matrix composition and vascular smooth muscle pathology, including intimal hyperplasia. SSc, however, differed significantly from c-GVHD in three ways. First, there were significantly fewer (p = 0.00001) average vessels in SSc biopsies (9.8) when compared with c-GVHD (16.5). Second, in SSc, endothelial markers were decreased significantly (19/19 and 12/14 for VE cadherin and vWF (p = <0.0001 and <0.05), respectively). In contrast, 0/13 c-GVHD biopsies showed loss of staining with canonical endothelial markers. Third, c-GVHD contained areas of microvascular endothelial proliferation not present in the SSc biopsies. Conclusions/Significance The sclerosis associated with c-GVHD appears to resemble wound healing. Focal capillary proliferation occurs in early c-GVHD. In contrast, loss of canonical endothelial markers and dermal capillaries is seen in SSc, but not in c-GVHD. The loss of VE cadherin in SSc, in particular, may be related to microvascular rarefaction because VE cadherin is necessary for angiogenesis. C-GVHD is a suitable model for studying dermal fibrosis but may not be applicable for studying the microvascular alterations characteristic of SSc."
https://openalex.org/W1974726267,"Background Sciatic nerve injuries often cause partial or total loss of motor, sensory and autonomic functions due to the axon discontinuity, degeneration, and eventual death which finally result in substantial functional loss and decreased quality of life. Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays a critical role in peripheral nerve regeneration. However, the lack of efficient NGF delivery approach limits its clinical applications. We reported here by fusing with the N-terminal domain of agrin (NtA), NGF-β could target to nerve cells and improve nerve regeneration. Methods Laminin-binding assay and sustained release assay of NGF-β fused with NtA (LBD-NGF) from laminin in vitro were carried out. The bioactivity of LBD-NGF on laminin in vitro was also measured. Using the rat sciatic nerve crush injury model, the nerve repair and functional restoration by utilizing LBD-NGF were tested. Findings LBD-NGF could specifically bind to laminin and maintain NGF activity both in vitro and in vivo. In the rat sciatic nerve crush injury model, we found that LBD-NGF could be retained and concentrated at the nerve injury sites to promote nerve repair and enhance functional restoration following nerve damages. Conclusion Fused with NtA, NGF-β could bind to laminin specifically. Since laminin is the major component of nerve extracellular matrix, laminin binding NGF could target to nerve cells and improve the repair of peripheral nerve injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2029608127,"Cyclical activation and inactivation of Rho family small G proteins, such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are needed for moving cells to form leading edge structures in response to chemoattractants. However, the mechanisms underlying the dynamic regulation of their activities are not fully understood. We recently showed that another small G protein, Rap1, plays a crucial role in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced formation of leading edge structures and activation of Rac1 in NIH3T3 cells. We showed here that knockdown of afadin, an actin-binding protein, in NIH3T3 cells resulted in a failure to develop leading edge structures in association with an impairment of the activation of Rap1 and Rac1 and inactivation of RhoA in response to PDGF. Overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Rap1 (Rap1-CA) and knockdown of SPA-1, a Rap1 GTPase-activating protein that was negatively regulated by afadin by virtue of binding to it, in afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells restored the formation of leading edge structures and the reduction of the PDGF-induced activation of Rac1 and inactivation of RhoA, suggesting that the inactivation of Rap1 by SPA-1 is responsible for inhibition of the formation of leading edge structures. The effect of Rap1-CA on the restoration of the formation of leading edge structures and RhoA inactivation was diminished by additional knockdown of ARAP1, a Rap-activated Rho GAP, which localized at the leading edges of moving NIH3T3 cells.

Cell migration is a spatiotemporally regulated process involving the formation and disassembly of protrusions, such as filopodia and lamellipodia, ruffles, focal complexes, and focal adhesions. At the leading edges of moving cells, the continuous formation and disassembly of these protrusive structures are tightly regulated by the actions of the Rho family small G proteins, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. RhoA regulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 regulate the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively (1.Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3828) Google Scholar, 2.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3728) Google Scholar). In addition, both Rac1 and Cdc42 regulate the formation of focal complexes (3.Ballestrem C. Hinz B. Imhof B.A. Wehrle-Haller B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 4.Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In order to have cells keep moving, each member of the Rho family small G proteins should cyclically be active and inactive as these leading edge structures are dynamically formed and disassembled. Rac1 and Cdc42 must be activated and RhoA must be inactivated at focal complexes, and vice versa at focal adhesions. Thus, the cyclical activation and inactivation of the Rho family small G proteins are critical for turnover of the transformation of focal complexes into focal adhesions during cell movement. The activities of these small G proteins are tightly regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). 2The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorPDGFRPDGF receptorRARas associationCAconstitutively activeDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumAbantibodymAbmonoclonal antibodypAbpolyclonal antibodyBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salineRTreverse transcriptionGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPaaamino acid(s)siRNAsmall interfering RNAKDknockdownHAhemagglutinin. 2The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorPDGFRPDGF receptorRARas associationCAconstitutively activeDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumAbantibodymAbmonoclonal antibodypAbpolyclonal antibodyBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salineRTreverse transcriptionGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPaaamino acid(s)siRNAsmall interfering RNAKDknockdownHAhemagglutinin. It is likely that signals from receptors and integrins cooperatively regulate the dynamics of this spatial and temporal activation and inactivation of the Rho family small G proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms of their cyclical activation and inactivation through the regulation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GAPs at the leading edges remain largely unknown.

We recently showed that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR), integrin αvβ3, and Necl-5 associate with each other and form a complex and that this complex is clustered at the leading edges of directionally moving NIH3T3 cells in response to PDGF (5.Minami Y. Ikeda W. Kajita M. Fujito T. Amano H. Tamaru Y. Kuramitsu K. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 269-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that PDGF induces the activation of Rap1, which then induces the activation of Rac1 (7.Takahashi M. Rikitake Y. Nagamatsu Y. Hara T. Ikeda W. Hirata K. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 549-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Rap1GAP to inactivate Rap1 inhibits the PDGF-induced formation of leading edge structures, cell movement, and activation of Rac1, suggesting that, in addition to the activation of Rap1, the subsequent activation of Rac1 and presumably the inactivation of RhoA may be critical for the PDGF-induced migration of NIH3T3 cells. Afadin is a nectin- and F-actin-binding protein that is involved in the formation of adherens junctions in cooperation with nectin and cadherin (8.Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Afadin has multiple domains: two Ras association (RA) domains, a forkhead-associated domain, a dilute domain, a PSD-95-Dlg-1-ZO-1 domain, three proline-rich domains, and an F-actin-binding domain at the C terminus and localizes to adherens junctions in epithelial cells (9.Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Afadin-knock-out mice showed impaired formation of the cell-cell junction during embryogenesis (10.Ikeda W. Nakanishi H. Miyoshi J. Mandai K. Ishizaki H. Tanaka M. Togawa A. Takahashi K. Nishioka H. Yoshida H. Mizoguchi A. Nishikawa S. Takai Y. J.

Although Ras small G protein was initially identified as an interacting molecule with the RA domain of afadin (12.Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), other studies demonstrate that afadin binds GTP-bound Rap1 with a higher affinity than GTP-bound Ras or GTP-bound Rap2 (13.Linnemann T.

Govek E.E. Cross J. Van Aelst L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9064-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition to the functional role of afadin in the organization of cell-cell adhesion, we recently found that, in NIH3T3 cells that do not form cell-cell junctions, afadin did not associate with nectin, localized at the leading edges during cell movement, and was involved in their directional, but not random, movement. The interaction of afadin with Rap1 at the leading edge was necessary for the PDGF-induced directional movement of NIH3T3 cells. Thus, in addition to that in the formation of adherens junctions, afadin plays another role in directional cell movement in NIH3T3 cells. In a series of studies using afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells, we found that neither lamellipodia, ruffles, nor focal complexes are formed, suggesting that Rap1 may be inactivated and, conversely, RhoA may be activated in the reduced state of afadin. Here we first examined this possibility and found that Rap1 is indeed inactivated, whereas RhoA is activated in afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells. To understand the mechanisms of how the activities of Rap1 and RhoA are regulated in afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells, we searched for afadin-interacting proteins that could potentially regulate Rap1 activity and sought Rap1 targets that might regulate RhoA activity. We focused on SPA-1 and ARAP1 and found that these proteins coordinately regulate the activities of these small G proteins. SPA-1 is a GAP for Rap1 that interacts with afadin (15.Su L. Hattori M. Moriyama M. Murata N. Harazaki M. Kaibuchi K. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15232-15238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereas ARAP1 is a Rho GAP that binds Rap1 and could be activated by virtue of this binding (16.Miura K.

We describe here how afadin regulates the cyclical activation and inactivation of Rap1, Rac1, and RhoA through SPA-1 and ARAP1 at the leading edges of moving NIH3T3 cells. We conclude that afadin is critical for the coordinated regulation of the activation of Rap1 and Rac1 and subsequent inactivation of RhoA necessary for cell movement. Expression vectors for GFP-tagged Rap1 (pEGFP-Rap1), FLAG-tagged Rap1-CA (pIRM21-FLAG-Rap1-CA), and GFP-tagged Rap1-CA (pEGFP-Rap1-CA) were prepared as described (7.Takahashi M. Rikitake Y.

Expression vectors for Myc-tagged dominant negative Rac1 and RhoA (pEF-BOS-Myc Rac1-DN and pEF-BOS-Myc RhoA-DN, respectively) and FLAG-tagged constitutively active Rac1 (pEF-BOS-FLAG Rac1-CA) were prepared as described previously (19.Ikeda W.

Kitagawa Y. Okamoto R. Ogita H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37815-37825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged SPA-1 and FLAG-tagged SPA-1 lacking the GAP-related domain (SPA-1-ΔGAP) were kindly provided by Prof. N. Minato (Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan). A plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged ARAP1 was a kind gift from Dr. K. Miura (Osaka Bioscience Institute, Suita, Japan). Expression vectors for HA-tagged ARAP1 and mutants of ARAP1, in which the RA domain and the Rho GAP domain were deleted (ARAP1-ΔRBD and ARAP1-ΔRGD, respectively), were constructed by standard molecular biology methods. The constructs of SPA-1 contained the following amino acids (aa): pSRα-FLAG-SPA-1, aa 1–1038; pSRα-FLAG-SPA-1-ΔGAP, aa 212–532 deletion. The constructs of ARAP1 contained the following aa: pCMV-HA-ARAP1, aa 75–1210; pCMV-HA-ARAP1-ΔRBD, aa 932–1021 deletion; pCMV-HA-ARAP1-ΔRGD, aa 714–899 deletion. Plasmids expressing siRNA-resistant mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum. Afadin-knockdown stable NIH3T3 cell lines (afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells) were established as described (21.Nakata S. Fujita N. Kitagawa Y. Okamoto R. Ogita H. Takai Y. J. Biol.

For transient expression experiments, cells were transfected with various expression vectors and siRNAs by the use of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable NIH3T3 and afadin-knockdown stable NIH3T3 cell lines in which GFP or GFP-Rap1-CA were stably expressed (GFP-NIH3T3, GFP-Rap1-CA-NIH3T3, afadin-KD-GFP-NIH3T3, and afadin-KD-GFP-Rap1-CA-NIH3T3 cells) were obtained by infection of pMSCVpuro-EGFP-C1M and pMSCVpuro-EGFP-C1M-bV12Rap1B recombinant retroviruses, respectively, and selection with puromycin. Rat anti-Necl-5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was prepared as described (22.Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Itoh S. Shingai T. Takekuni K. Satoh K. Inoue Y. Hamaguchi A. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs were purchased from GE Healthcare. Fluorophore (fluorescein isothiocyanate, Cy3, and Cy5)-conjugated secondary Abs were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Rabbit anti-SPA-1 and anti-ARAP1 pAbs were kindly provided by Prof. N. Minato and Dr. K. Miura, respectively. Human recombinant PDGF-BB was purchased from PEPROTECH. Vitronectin was purified from human plasma (Kohjinbio) as described (23.Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Stealth RNAis for SPA-1 and ARAP1 were purchased from Invitrogen. To generate a concentration gradient of PDGF, a μ-Slide VI flow (uncoated; Ibidi) was used (5.Minami Y. Ikeda W. Kajita M. Fujito T. Amano H. Tamaru Y. Kuramitsu K. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18481-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In brief, the μ-Slide VI flow has six parallel channels, which were coated with 5 μg/ml vitronectin, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2, cultured for 16 h, and starved of serum with DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. The concentration gradient of PDGF was applied using DMEM containing 0.5% BSA and 30 ng/ml PDGF according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 30 min, cells were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1) or, alternatively, 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated with 100% methanol at −20 °C. Cells were incubated with 1% BSA in PBS and then incubated with 20% BlockAce in PBS, followed by immunofluorescence microscopy (24.Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To analyze the leading edge formation quantitatively, the signal for F-actin, a major component of peripheral ruffles, was observed. Two investigators blindly counted at least 100 cells of each type, and the results were averaged. The cell morphology was classified into four categories: “lamellipodia with ruffles,” “lamellipodia without ruffles,” “thin and angular shapes,” and “round shapes.” Pull-down assays were performed as described (25.Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were plated on vitronectin-coated dishes and cultured overnight. After 1 h of serum starvation, cells were treated with PDGF-BB and then washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, lysed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μm 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) containing 30 μg of GST fusion proteins, GST-RalGDS-RBD for Rap1, GST-PAK-CRIB for Rac1, or GST-Rhotekin for RhoA, and incubated at 2 °C for 30 min. The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 0 °C for 10 min and incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) at 2 °C for 1 h. After the beads were washed with Buffer A, proteins bound to the beads were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Total mRNA was isolated from NIH3T3 cells and J774.1 cells by the use of TRIzol (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of mRNAs were subjected to RT-PCR using Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) with specific primers for ARAP1 (5′-ttgacgactctgactatgatgatgt-3′ and 5′-ggcgtccttgttactgtcaaagtat-3′), ARAP2 (5′-tttggagcagtacctcttacatttc-3′ and 5′-cagtaatggaatcggaacactctat-3′), ARAP3 (5′-atgatgcctaatgccatctactttg-3′ and 5′-gtcactgccaaagtacattagactc-3′), or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-acggatttggtcgtattgggc-3′ and 5′-ttgacggtgccatggaatttg-3′). Cells were untransfected or transfected with the indicated siRNA, cultured for 48 h, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed with 5× Laemmli buffer and boiled. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated with primary Abs, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs. After incubation with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate or SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce), signals were detected using the LAS-3000mini imaging system (Fujifilm). Cell migration was investigated using Boyden chamber assays as described (26.Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18015-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In brief, cell culture inserts with PET membranes (8.0-μm pores; BD Biosciences) were coated with 5 μg/ml vitronectin for 1 h and then blocked with 1% BSA at 37 °C for 30 min. NIH3T3 cells, which had been serum-starved with DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA for 1 h, were detached with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA and then treated with a trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The cells were then resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA and plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/insert. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in the presence or absence of 30 ng/ml PDGF-BB. PDGF-BB was added only to the bottom well to generate a concentration gradient. After incubation, the inserts were washed with PBS, and the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. The cells that had not migrated were removed by wiping the top of the membrane with a cotton swab. The number of migrated cells in five randomly chosen fields per filter was counted by microscopic examination. We first examined the effect of knockdown of afadin on the activities of Rap1, Rac1, and RhoA in NIH3T3 cells that were stimulated by PDGF. Wild-type and afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells were sparsely plated on μ-slide VI flow dishes precoated with vitronectin, an extracellular matrix protein that binds integrin αVβ3 (27.van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), starved of serum, and directionally stimulated by PDGF. Most NIH3T3 cells became polarized and formed protrusive lamellipodia and ruffles over the lamellipodia at the leading edges in the direction of higher concentrations of PDGF, whereas afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells morphologically showed elongated shapes with no marked lamellipodia or ruffles and developed more prominent stress fibers than in wild-type cells (Fig. 1, A and B) (21.Nakata S. Fujita N. Kitagawa Y. Okamoto R. Ogita H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37815-37825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, the immunofluorescence signals for Necl-5, PDGFR, and integrin β3 were concentrated and co-localized at the ruffles. The signal for Necl-5 was observed at focal complexes under the ruffles, whereas the signal for integrin β3 was apparent at both focal complexes and focal adhesions. These results were consistent with our earlier observations (5.Minami Y. Ikeda W. Kajita M. Fujito T. Amano H. Tamaru Y. Kuramitsu K. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18481-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Pull-down assays showed that PDGF increased the amounts of GTP-bound Rap1 and Rac1 in wild-type NIH3T3 cells, whereas in afadin-knockdown cells, the amounts of GTP-bound Rap1 and Rac1 were decreased even in the absence of PDGF as compared with those in wild-type cells, and PDGF failed to increase them (Fig. 1, C and D). PDGF decreased the amount of GTP-bound RhoA in wild-type cells, whereas it was markedly increased even in the absence of PDGF, and PDGF failed to decrease it in afadin-knockdown cells as compared with that in wild-type cells (Fig. 1E). The total amounts of these small G proteins were not different between these two types of cells. These results indicate that afadin regulates the PDGF-induced activation of Rap1 and Rac1 and inactivation of RhoA. To examine whether a decrease in Rap1 activity is responsible for the impaired formation of leading edge structures in afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells, we tested a possibility that Rap1-CA could restore the impaired formation of leading edge structures in afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells. Analysis of cell morphology revealed that most wild-type NIH3T3 cells formed the polarized structures with lamellipodia (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the number of cells forming the polarized structures with lamellipodia was decreased, whereas the number of cells with thin and angular shapes was increased in afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells. An expression of GFP-Rap1-CA, but not GFP, in afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells increased the percentage of the cells to form the polarized structures with lamellipodia and decreased the percentage of the cells with thin and angular shapes. An expression of GFP-Rap1-CA reduced stress fibers and reformed lamellipodia, ruffles, and focal complexes at the leading edges, similar to those in wild-type NIH3T3 cells as the immunofluorescence signals for Necl-5, PDGFR, and integrin β3 were concentrated and co-localized at the ruffles (Fig. 2B). The signal for Necl-5 was observed at focal complexes under the ruffles, whereas the signal for integrin β3 was apparent at both focal complexes and focal adhesions. On the other hand, GFP-transfected cells showed elongated shapes with no marked lamellipodia or ruffles and displayed prominent stress fibers, as did afadin-knockdown cells (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the reduced activation of Rap1 is responsible for the impaired formation of leading edge structures in afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells. To examine whether suppression of Rap1 activity is responsible for the reduced activation of Rac1 and the reduced inactivation of RhoA in afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells, we tested the possibility that Rap1-CA could restore the activation levels of these small G proteins in afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells. For this purpose, we established and used afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells stably expressing GFP (afadin-KD-GFP-NIH3T3 cells) or GFP-tagged Rap1-CA (afadin-KD-GFP-Rap1-CA-NIH3T3 cells). Treatment of afadin-KD-GFP-NIH3T3 cells with PDGF induced the activation of Rac1 in a time-dependent manner, but the PDGF-induced activation of Rac1 was augmented in afadin-KD-GFP-Rap1-CA-NIH3T3 cells as compared with that in afadin-KD-GFP-NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2D). In addition, the level of the amount of GTP-bound RhoA was significantly higher in afadin-KD-GFP-NIH3T3 cells than that in afadin-KD-GFP-Rap1-CA-NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2D). Notably, the PDGF-induced inactivation of RhoA was observed in afadin-KD-GFP-Rap1-CA-NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that Rap1-CA can restore the reduced activation of Rac1 and inactivation of RhoA in afadin-knockdown cells. We further examined the possibility that activation of Rac1 or inactivation of RhoA could restore Rap1 activation levels. To detect clearly the effects of Rap1-CA and RhoA-DN, GFP-tagged Rap1 was co-expressed in afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells, and GFP-Rap1 from transfected cells was then selectively detected by subsequent anti-GFP blotting of precipitated GTP-bound Rap1. Introducing Rac1-CA, but not RhoA-DN, restored the amount of GTP-bound Rap1 (Fig. 2E), indicating that restoring Rac1 activity, but not RhoA activity, reversed Rap1 activity in afadin-knockdown NIH3T3 cells. Conversely, introducing Rac1-DN in wild-type NIH3T3 cells did not affect the PDGF-induced Rap1 activation (Fig. 2F). Thus, once Rap1 is activated in response to PDGF, activated Rap1 stimulates activation of Rac1, and activated Rac1 then potentiates the PDGF-induced activation of Rap1 in a positive feedback manner. Boyden chamber assays revealed that knockdown of afadin reduced a motile activity in NIH3T3 cells and that overexpression of Rap1-CA did not restore the reduced cell motile activity despite the restoration of morphology and the activation levels of Rac1 and RhoA (Fig. 2G). These results indicate that cyclical, but not persistent, activation and inactivation of Rap1, Rac1, and RhoA are needed for efficient cell movement. To understand the mechanism by which afadin regulates the Rap1 activity, we examined the possibility that SPA-1, a Rap1 GAP known to bind afadin (15.Su L. Hattori M. Moriyama M. Murata N. Harazaki M. Kaibuchi K. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15232-15238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), is involved in this regulation. When SPA-1 was additionally silenced by means of SPA-1 siRNA in afad"
https://openalex.org/W2107749175,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of most common and still poorly treated primary brain tumors. In search for new therapeutic approaches, Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) induce astroglial commitment in GBM-derived cells in vitro. However, we recently suggested that hypoxia, which is characteristic of the brain niche where GBM reside, strongly counter-acts BMP effects. It seems apparent that a more complete understanding of the biology of GBM cells is needed, in particular considering the role played by hypoxia as a signaling pathways regulator. HIF-1alpha is controlled at the transcriptional and translational level by mTOR and, alike BMP, also mTOR pathway modulates glial differentiation in central nervous system (CNS) stem cells.Here, we investigate the role of mTOR signaling in the regulation of HIF-1alpha stability in primary GBM-derived cells maintained under hypoxia (2% oxygen). We found that GBM cells, when acutely exposed to high oxygen tension, undergo Akt/mTOR pathway activation and that BMP2 acts in an analogous way. Importantly, repression of Akt/mTOR signaling is maintained by HIF-1alpha through REDD1 upregulation. On the other hand, BMP2 counter-acts HIF-1alpha stability by modulating intracellular succinate and by controlling proline hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) protein through inhibition of FKBP38, a PHD2 protein regulator.In this study we elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which two pro-differentiating stimuli, BMP2 and acute high oxygen exposure, control HIF-1alpha stability. We previously reported that both these stimuli, by inducing astroglial differentiation, affect GBM cells growth. We also found differences in high oxygen and BMP2 sensitivity between GBM cells and normal cells that should be further investigated to better define tumor cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W2081113319,"Ras GTPases are lipid-anchored G proteins which play a fundamental role in cell signaling processes. Electron micrographs of immunogold-labeled Ras have shown that membrane-bound Ras molecules segregate into nanocluster domains. Several models have been developed in attempts to obtain quantitative descriptions of nanocluster formation, but all have relied on assumptions such as a constant, expression-level independent ratio of Ras in clusters to Ras monomers (cluster/monomer ratio). However, this assumption is inconsistent with the law of mass action. Here, we present a biophysical model of Ras clustering based on short-range attraction and long-range repulsion between Ras molecules in the membrane. To test this model, we performed Monte Carlo simulations and compared statistical clustering properties with experimental data. We find that we can recover the experimentally-observed clustering across a range of Ras expression levels, without assuming a constant cluster/monomer ratio or the existence of lipid rafts. In addition, our model makes predictions about the signaling properties of Ras nanoclusters in support of the idea that Ras nanoclusters act as an analog-digital-analog converter for high fidelity signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2112832244,"It is increasingly being recognized that predation can be a strong diversifying agent promoting ecological divergence. Adaptations against different predatory regimes can emerge over short periods of time and include many different traits. We studied antipredator adaptations in two ecotypes of an isopod (Asellus aquaticus) that have, diverged in parallel in two Swedish lakes over the last two decades. We quantified differences in escape speed, morphology and behavior for isopods from different ecotypes present in these lakes. Isopods from the source habitat (reed) coexist with mainly invertebrate predators. They are more stream-profiled and have higher escape speeds than isopods in the newly colonized stonewort habitat, which has higher density of fish predators. Stonewort isopods also show more cautious behaviors and had higher levels of phenotypic integration between coloration and morphological traits than the reed isopods. Colonization of a novel habitat with a different predation regime has thus strengthened the correlations between pigmentation and morphology and weakened escape performance. The strong signature of parallelism for these phenotypic traits indicates that divergence is likely to be adaptive and is likely to have been driven by differences in predatory regimes. Furthermore, our results indicate that physical performance, behavior and morphology can change rapidly and in concert as new habitats are colonized."

https://openalex.org/W2029086133,"A group of breast cancer patients with a higher probability of developing metastasis expresses a series of carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) of the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2. One of these fragments, 611-CTF, is a hyperactive form of HER2 that constitutively establishes homodimers maintained by disulfide bonds, making it an excellent model to study overactivation of HER2 during tumor progression and metastasis. Here we show that expression of 611-CTF increases cell motility in a variety of assays. Since cell motility is frequently regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, we looked for phosphoproteins mediating the effect of 611-CTF using two alternative proteomic approaches, stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture and difference gel electrophoresis, and found that the latter is particularly well suited to detect changes in multiphosphorylated proteins. The difference gel electrophoresis screening identified cortactin, a cytoskeleton-binding protein involved in the regulation of cell migration, as a phosphoprotein probably regulated by 611-CTF. This result was validated by characterizing cortactin in cells expressing this HER2 fragment. Finally, we showed that the knockdown of cortactin impairs 611-CTF-induced cell migration. These results suggest that cortactin is a target of 611-CTF involved in the regulation of cell migration and, thus, in the metastatic behavior of breast tumors expressing this CTF."

The structural basis for this coupled transport process is not known. Here, a profile-based sequence analysis approach was used, predicting a distant relationship with the SLC5/6 transporter families. Homology models using the LeuTAa and Mhp1 transporters of known structure as templates were established, predicting the location of a conserved Na+ binding site in the center of membrane helices 1 and 8. This homology model was tested experimentally in the SLC38 member SNAT2 by analyzing the effect of a mutation to Thr-384, which is predicted to be part of this Na+ binding site. The results show that the T384A mutation not only inhibits the anion leak current, which requires Na+ binding to SNAT2, but also dramatically lowers the Na+ affinity of the transporter. This result is consistent with a previous analysis of the N82A mutant transporter, which has a similar effect on anion leak current and Na+ binding and which is also expected to form part of the Na+ binding site. In contrast, random mutations to other sites in the transporter had little or no effect on Na+ affinity. Our results are consistent with a cation binding site formed by transmembrane helices 1 and 8 that is conserved among the SLC38 transporters as well as among many other bacterial and plant transporter families of unknown structure, which are homologous to SLC38.

Despite this physiological importance, surprisingly little is known about the functional properties and the structural basis of amino acid transport by the SLC38 proteins. Although hydropathy analysis predicts 11 transmembrane helices (TMs), with an intracellular N terminus and an extracellular C terminus (1Mackenzie B. Erickson J.D. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the transporters belong to a large superfamily of transporters, of which members have been characterized structurally through x-ray crystallography. At present, sequence homology has only been established with transporters of the mammalian SLC32 and SLC36 families as well as with the more distantly related plant auxin carriers and the bacterial amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) family (15Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 16Young G.B. Jack D.L. Smith D.W. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochim. Biophys.

High resolution crystal structures are not available for any of the transporters from these families, although low resolution projection structures were recently reported for the APC family members AdiC (17Casagrande F.

However, these structures do not allow the assignment of transmembrane helices. Thus, it remains unknown whether the SLC38 fold is similar to established transport protein folds, although homology to the major facilitator superfamily seems unlikely. We have recently identified a conserved amino acid residue in SNAT2, Asn-82, which is involved in controlling the Na+ affinity of the transporter (19Zhang Z. Gameiro A. Grewer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12284-12292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Asn-82 is localized in the predicted TM1 of SNAT2. This first transmembrane helix was recently found to contribute ligands to a Na+ binding site in several bacterial transporters, which are related to the SLC5 (sodium glucose symporter) and SLC6 (sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporter) family members (20Faham S.

Although sequence similarity with SLC5 and -6 is not detectable, SLC38 may be a member of a possibly very large superfamily with the same general fold, which also contains many amino acid transport proteins. Here, we used a homology modeling approach based on profile-based sequence alignment (25Jung I. Lee J. Lee S.Y. Kim D. BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 298Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Söding J. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). A search against sequences deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB (27Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27591) Google Scholar)) revealed that the transporters with the highest likelihood to share an analogous fold are a leucine transporter from Aquifex aeolicus, LeuTAa, and a homologous hydantoin transporter from Microbacterium liquefaciens, Mhp1. We established a homology model based on these structures, which predicts Asn-82 to be part of a Na+ binding site. Furthermore, another conserved hydrophilic amino acid residue in TM8, Thr-384, was predicted to be near this cation binding site. When Thr-384 was mutated to alanine, a dramatic loss of the affinity of SNAT2 for Na+ was observed, whereas mutations to other sites that were spatially removed from the predicted Na+ binding site had little or no effect on Na+ affinity. We hypothesize that the SLC38 family is a member of a large superfamily of cation/organic substrate transporters which includes the mammalian SLC5 and -6 proteins and which has a conserved cation binding site formed by TMs 1 and 8. Sequence-based multiple alignment procedures were ineffective due to the non-significant sequence homology between SLC38 transporters and LeuTAa and Mhp1. Therefore, we used a profile-based sequence alignment approach (HHSearch procedure (26Söding J. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar, 28Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4470) Google Scholar)). Searches were performed against the PDB or Scop70 (as a positive control, verifying that homology with proteins of unknown structure but known homology with SLC38 can be detected with the HHSearch algorithm). Outputs of the pairwise sequence alignments were used to create homology models with the Modeller software (29Eswar N. John B. Mirkovic N. Fiser A. Ilyin V.A. Pieper U. Stuart A.C.

The resulting structure files were tested for quality with the ProQ program (31Wallner B. Elofsson A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) and against the InterPro secondary structure prediction algorithm (32Zdobnov E.M. Apweiler R. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 847-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar) to test for correct helical assignment of the transmembrane segments. For alignments of hydropathy profiles, gaps were either inserted into hydrophilic domains manually at the center between peaks, before alignment of the hydrophobic peaks or through the HHPred algorithm. Detection of internal repeats was performed by pairwise aligning the peptide sequence of each of the 11 TMs of SNAT2 against the remaining polypeptide sequence, with the respective TM removed. ClustalW was used for this purpose (Bioedit suite). We have also used REPRO for finding sequence duplications in SNAT3 (33George R.A. Heringa J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 515-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The SNAT2 expression construct consisted of the SNAT2 coding sequence in a modified pBK-CMV vector (Δ[1098–1300]) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (34Zhang Z. Grewer C. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 2621-2632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding SNAT2 linked to the C terminus of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was obtained from GeneCopoeia. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) as described by the supplier. The primers for mutation experiments were obtained from Sigma. The complete coding sequences of mutated SNAT2 clones were sequenced. Transporter constructs were subsequently used for transient transfection of subconfluent human embryonic kidney cell (HEK293T/17, ATCC number CRL 11268) cultures using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the instructions of the supplier. Electrophysiological recordings were performed between days 1 to 2 post-transfection. Biotinylation was performed essentially as described (35Tao Z. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, transfected HEK293T cells were grown in 10-cm plates. After the washing steps, cells were incubated in 2 ml of biotinylation reagent (2 mg/ml, EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin; Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min while gently shaking. After washing, 100 mm glycine was added at 4 °C and incubated for 45 min to quench any unreacted biotin reagent. The cells were lysed by adding 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer/lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, plus protease inhibitors) to the cell and by subsequent vortexing for 1 h at 4 °C (although the intense vortexing resulted in generation of foam, this foam disappeared after subsequent centrifugation steps). After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. After adding 300 μl of 50% slurry avidin beads (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline to 300 μl of sample and keeping the sample at room temperature for 1 h, the beads were sedimented by centrifugation and washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer/lysis buffer six times, 1 ml each time. Protein was eluted from the beads by adding 150 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer (1× Laemmli buffer contains 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Each fraction was adjusted to comparable volumes with Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using green fluorescent protein antibody obtained from Clontech. HEK293T cells were plated on collagen-coated 12-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and glutamine (4 mm). 48 h after transfection with vector, wild-type SNAT2, or SNAT2T384A cDNA, the cells were washed with uptake buffer 2 times. The uptake buffer contained 140 mm sodium methanesulfonate (NaMes), 2 mm magnesium methanesulfonate, 2 mm calcium gluconate, 30 mm Tris-Mes, pH 8.0, 5 mm glucose. The cells were then preincubated in the same buffer for 5 min at 37 °C before the buffer was removed and replaced with fresh buffer containing unlabeled α-methylamino-isobutyric acid (MeAIB) and 0.4 μCi of [14C]MeAIB (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; total concentration 40 μm). MeAIB was used as a transportable substrate instead of alanine, because unspecific uptake of [14C]alanine was too high in HEK293 cells (most likely caused by endogenous amino acid transporters other than SNAT2). After 1 min of incubation at room temperature, uptake was terminated by washing twice with 1 ml of uptake buffer on ice (after 1 min, uptake was in the linear range, as determined by quantifying the time dependence of uptake for times up to 5 min). The cells were then solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1% SDS, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting in 3 ml of scintillation fluid. The MeAIB uptake measurements were performed in duplicate. Transport and anion currents were recorded using an Adams & List EPC7 amplifier under voltage-clamped conditions in the whole-cell current-recording mode. The typical resistance of the recording electrode was 2–3 megaohms. The series resistance (Rs) was 4–7 megaohms. RS was not compensated, because the whole-cell currents were small (typically <200 pA). Thus, series resistance (RS) compensation had a negligible effect on the magnitude of the currents (<4% error). The extracellular bath buffer solution contained 140 mm NaMes, 2 mm magnesium gluconate, 2 mm calcium gluconate, 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0. All experiments were conducted at an extracellular pH of 8.0 (maximal transport rate at this pH). For testing the Na+ dependence of the currents, Na+ in the extracellular solution was replaced with NMG+ (N-methylglucamine). For recording anion currents, the pipette solution contained 140 mm KSCN, 2 mm magnesium gluconate, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. For transport current recording, the pipette contained 140 mm KMes, 2 mm magnesium gluconate, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. The recorded currents were low-pass-filtered online at 1–10 kHz (Krohn-Hite 3200) and digitized with a digitizer board (Axon, Digidata 1200) at a sampling rate of 10–50 kHz, which was controlled by software (Axon PClamp). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Solution exchange was performed essentially as described previously (36Grewer C. Watzke N. Wiessner M. Rauen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9706-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, substrates were applied to a voltage-clamped HEK293T cell suspended at the tip of the current recording electrode with a quartz tube (opening diameter, 350 μm) positioned at a distance of ∼0.5 mm to the cell. The linear flow rate of the solutions emerging from the opening of the tube was ∼5–10 cm/s, resulting in minimal rise times of the whole-cell current of 30–50 ms (10–90%). Nonlinear regression fits of experimental data were performed with Origin (Microcal software, Northampton, MA) or Clampfit (pClamp8 software, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Dose-response relationships of currents were fitted with a Michaelis-Menten-like equation, yielding Km and Imax. Endogenous electrogenic alanine transport activity in HEK293T cells, as measured by current recording from non-transfected cells, is minimal. Each experiment was performed in triplicate with at least two different cells. The error bars represent the mean ± S.D. unless stated otherwise. The hypothesis to be tested in this work is that a cation binding site is conserved between the SLC5/6 and SLC38 solute carrier families, although they show no significant sequence identity or similarity. For example, a ClustalW sequence alignment between SNAT2 and LeuTAa shows an insignificant identity of 12%. Therefore, we used alternative methods to identify a potential relationship between SNAT2 and LeuTAa. First, we applied hydropathy profile alignment (manual insertion of gaps, Fig. 1A, Kyte-Doolittle scale, (37Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17224) Google Scholar), alignment through HHPred, supplemental Fig. 1) of SNAT2 with the dopamine transporter (DAT1) SLC6A3 and the bacterial transporters of known structure, LeuTAa and Mhp1 (21Weyand S.

Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). It has been previously suggested that hydropathy alignment is a useful tool for identifying distant relationships between membrane proteins (38Clements J.D. Martin R.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2101-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Lolkema J.S. Slotboom D.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 305-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that the putative TMs 1–2, 4–5, and 9–10 occur in pairs for all of these transporters, being separated only by short hydrophilic segments. Second, TM3 in particular and also TM8 are long (predicted 25–30 amino acid residues). This suggests a tilted configuration of these SNAT2 TMs within the membrane bilayer, as found experimentally in LeuTAa and Mhp1 (21Weyand S. Shimamura T. Yajima S. Suzuki S. Mirza O. Krusong K.

Third, TMs 1 and 6 contain many hydrophilic side chains with a peak hydropathy index of about 1.7 in all but one (Mhp1) transporter tested. Fourth, amino acid residues in TM11 are poorly conserved among members of the SLC38 family, indicating that this TM is not important for substrate transport, as suggested by the structure of LeuTAa (22Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). LeuTAa and Mhp1 demonstrate sequence duplication of the TM 1–5 and 6–10 domains, which are inserted into the membrane in an inverted topology (21Weyand S. Shimamura T. Yajima S. Suzuki S. Mirza O. Krusong K. Carpenter E.P. Rutherford N.G. Hadden J.M. O'Reilly J. Ma P. Saidijam M. Patching S.G. Hope R.J. Norbertczak H.T. Roach P.C. Iwata S. Henderson P.J. Cameron A.D.

Therefore, we asked the question of whether such repeats can be detected in the SLC38 proteins. Evidence for internal repeats was obtained through sequence alignment of a respective transporter segment (a predicted TM domain) against the remaining protein (Fig. 1B). The most notable repeat was a 28-residue TM5-TM10 repeat (motif 3 in Fig. 1B). Two other, although shorter, repeats were found between TM2-TM7 and TM3-TM8 (Fig. 1B, motifs 1 and 2). These repeats, which are highlighted in Fig. 1C, map to the predicted SNAT2 topology as if TMs 1–5 and 5–10 were generated by sequence duplication, as proposed for LeuTAa and Mhp1 (21Weyand S. Shimamura T. Yajima S. Suzuki S. Mirza O. Krusong K. Carpenter E.P. Rutherford N.G. Hadden J.M. O'Reilly J. Ma P. Saidijam M. Patching S.G. Hope R.J. Norbertczak H.T. Roach P.C. Iwata S.

Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis shows that these repeats are 50–200-fold more likely compared with what would be expected by alignment to a random sequence (Fig. 1B, table). Moreover, alignment of the sequences of the C-terminal and the N-terminal halves of SNAT3 shows 16% sequence identity and 35% sequence similarity, consistent with tandem duplication. A hydropathy plot of an alignment of the N-terminal and C-terminal segments of SNAT2 is illustrated in supplemental Fig. 2, showing reasonable alignment for all predicted TM helices, except TMs 3 and 8. For all the above reasons, the general folding pattern of SNAT2 demonstrates evidence for tandem duplication and appears to mimic that of the known structure of the bacterial transporters that are related to the SLC5 and SLC6 families. To further test the predicted distant relationship of SNAT2 and LeuTAa, we performed profile-based alignment using the HHSearch method, which has been shown to be efficient in finding distant relationships between protein families (26Söding J. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). The algorithm was run against the sequences deposited in the PDB, which contains LeuTAa and Mhp1. This search resulted in PDB structures 2A65 (LeuTAa) and 2JLN (Mhp1) as the most likely hits (21Weyand S. Shimamura T. Yajima S. Suzuki S. Mirza O. Krusong K. Carpenter E.P. Rutherford N.G.

Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar), with a HHSearch score of 108 for SNAT2 alignment with LeuTAa. The alignment with LeuTAa resulted in sequence identity of 15% and similarity of 33%. The sodium galactose transporter, vSGLT (20Faham S. Watanabe A. Besserer G.M. Cascio D. Specht A. Hirayama B.A. Wright E.M. Abramson J. Science. 2008; 321: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), which is related to LeuTAa and Mhp1, was also found as a hit (supplemental Fig. 3B) as well as BetP (40Ressl S. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Vonrhein C. Ott V. Ziegler C. Nature. 2009; 458: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The helical domains predicted by this homology model fit well with helical segments from secondary structure prediction (supplemental Fig. 4). As a positive control for the algorithm, we used the human GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) transporter sequence GAT1 (GABA transporter 1; SLC6), which is more closely related to LeuTAa and yielded a score of 995 (Fig. 2C). As a negative control, the Lac permease from Escherichia coli and GltPh from Pyrococcus horikoshii, which are not related to LeuTAa, yielded a score of 13 and less. The HHSearch score and those of GabP (γ-aminobutyric acid permease (41Hu L.A. King S.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), APC family member related to SNAT2) and SNAT1 alignments are summarized in Fig. 2C. This profile-based alignment was then used to generate a homology model of SNAT2 using LeuTAa as the template (Fig. 2B, sequence of predicted TMs 1 and 8 shown in Fig. 2A). The model was validated with ProQ, resulting in an LGscore of 4.5 (Fig. 2C, energy minimized using Swissmod, LGScores >4 indicate native-like structures). LGscores of positive and negative controls are also shown in Fig. 2C, underscoring the validity of this homology modeling approach. Similar results were obtained for repeating this approach with Mhp1 as a template (supplemental Fig. 3A), although the LGscore was <4, indicating a non-native structure. Together with the results obtained for vSGLT and BetP (supplemental Fig. 3B), LeuTAa appears to be the best template for SNAT2 homology modeling. To summarize, the sequence analysis and homology modeling data predict that the SLC38 family is distantly related to the SLC5/6 families. The homology model predicts that Asn-82, which has been shown previously to control Na+ interaction with SNAT2 (19Zhang Z. Gameiro A. Grewer C. J. Biol.

It is constitutively inactivated in several hyperinsulinemic/obese mouse models, thereby enhancing their metabolic phenotypes. Foxa2 is activated under fasting conditions but is inhibited by insulin signaling via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, which results in its nuclear exclusion. However, the mechanism and relative importance of its nuclear export has not yet been elucidated. Here we show that Foxa2 contains a functional nuclear export signal and is excluded from the nucleus via a CRM1-dependent pathway in response to insulin signaling. Furthermore, direct evidence is provided that nuclear export-defective Foxa2 is phosphorylated and inactivated by insulin in vitro and in vivo. These data demonstrate for the first time that phosphorylation itself is the main event regulating the activity of Foxa2, suggesting that export-independent mechanisms have evolved to ensure inhibition of Foxa2 under conditions in which insulin signaling is present.

They all have in common a highly conserved winged helix motif that is responsible for monomeric recognition of specific DNA target sites and is similar in structure to that of the linker histone H5 (4Clark K.L.

However, in contrast to linker histones, which compact DNA in chromatin and repress gene expression, FoxA proteins are associated with transcriptionally active chromatin and may decompact DNA from the nucleosome (5Cirillo L.A.

This sequence divergence allows for unique posttranslational modifications (e.g. AKT phosphorylation of Foxa2 at residue Thr-156 (7Wolfrum C. Besser D. Luca E. Stoffel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mice homozygous for a null mutation in Foxa2 exhibit an embryonic lethal phenotype, lack a notochord, and exhibit defects in foregut and neural tube development, whereas Foxa3-deficient mice develop normally (10Kaestner K.H.

In the livers of adult mice, Foxa2 activity has been shown to mediate fasting responses, including fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and increased very low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein (VLDL and HDL) secretion by activating gene expression of key enzymes of these pathways (8Wolfrum C. Stoffel M. Cell Metabolism. 2006; 3: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 15Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M.

In the postprandial state, when insulin levels rise, Foxa2 is phosphorylated at threonine residue 156 through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling, which results in nuclear exclusion of Foxa2 and inhibition of its target genes (7Wolfrum C.

In hyperinsulinemic/obese mice, Foxa2 is permanently excluded from the nucleus and its inactivation contributes to the development of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. This has been demonstrated by re-expression of constitutive active Foxa2 (Foxa2-T156A) in livers of obese mouse models which led to increased fatty acid oxidation, increased VLDL secretion, reduced hepatic triglyceride content, increased insulin sensitivity and normalization of blood glucose levels (15Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The negative regulation of Forkhead transcription factors by nutritional or stress signals is not unique to Foxa2. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans suppresses the function of DAF-16, a transcription factor that also belongs to the Forkhead/winged-helix family (18Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). Mutations in the insulin/Igf-1 receptor homologue (daf-2) (19Kenyon C. Chang J. Gensch E. Rudner A. Tabtiang R. Nature. 1993; 366: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar, 20Gottlieb S.

In each case, mutation of daf-16 restores normal life span and prevents entry into the dauer stage. In mammals, this regulation has also been described for Fkhr (Foxo1), Fkhrl1 (Foxo3), and AFX (Foxo4) (23Kops G.J. de Ruiter N.D. De Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M.

Foxo1 can be phosphorylated by Pkb/Akt at multiple sites causing repression of transcriptional activity of target genes such as insulin growth factor-binding protein 1, glucose-6-phosphatase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (27Durham S.K.

Similar to Foxa2, this regulation has been shown to occur, at least in part, by nuclear exclusion, although recent findings suggest that additional mechanisms are involved (29Tsai W.C. Bhattacharyya N. Han L.Y. Hanover J.A. Rechler M.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5615-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, at the moment it is unclear whether nuclear export is the key mechanism regulating FoxO transcription factors or whether other nucleus-specific regulatory pathways are involved in the regulation of this factor as well. Although it is clear that phosphorylation is necessary for nuclear exclusion of Foxa2, the mechanism and importance of nuclear exclusion in the inactivation of Foxa2 by insulin has not yet been investigated. Here, we have explored the molecular mechanisms controlling nuclear exclusion of Foxa2 in response to insulin signaling and phosphorylation at residue Thr-156. We show that Foxa2 contains a functional, leptomycin B (LMB)-sensitive (CRM1-dependent), leucine-rich nuclear export sequence, which is necessary for nuclear exclusion of Foxa2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of this factor, rather than nuclear exclusion, is the key regulatory event modulating Foxa2 activity in response to insulin signaling. Human recombinant insulin (I9278), collagen (type I, C3867), and leptomycin B (L2913) were purchased from Sigma. The following antibodies were used: HA (Covance and Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal to Foxa2 (Abcam); anti-phosphorylated Foxa2 (Thr-156, Cell Signaling) (generated and described previously (15Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M.

Emut (L110A,L113A) and TAE (L110A,L113A,T156A) constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using overlap extension PCR. Adenoviruses were generated using the Rapid Adenovirus Production System (Viraquest). With the exception of Ad-GFP-C1Foxa2, GFP was coexpressed from an independent promoter in addition to HA-Foxa2 or Foxa2 variants. Ad-GFP, Ad-Foxa2, and Ad-T156A were described previously (15Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). For in vivo experiments, mice were injected with 8 × 108 plaque-forming units of adenovirus through the tail vein. HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes were maintained on collagen-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen; containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, 4 mm l-glutamine) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Serum starvation was carried out for 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum or penicillin/streptomycin. Stable cell lines were generated by transfection of 4.5 × 106 HepG2 cells with 6 μg of plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and selection with 1 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem) over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. Clonal populations were isolated and analyzed for expression of Foxa2 constructs by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody (MMS-101P, Covance). Primary hepatocytes were isolated as described previously (16Wolfrum C. Howell J.J. Ndungo E. Stoffel M. J. Biol.

C57Bl/6 and ob/ob mice were purchased from Charles River and maintained on a normal chow diet and a 12-h light/dark cycle. HepG2 cells were grown in 10-cm plates to 80% confluency and serum-starved for 18 h followed by the indicated treatments (LMB: 2 h with 2.5 ng/ml leptomycin B; insulin: 500 nm human recombinant insulin for 15 min at 37 °C). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (16Wolfrum C. Howell J.J. Ndungo E. Stoffel M. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were swollen on ice in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors (Complete mixture, Roche Applied Science) and permeabilized by the addition of Nonidet P-40 to 0.6%. After centrifugation at 10,400 × g for 30 s at 4 °C, the supernatants (cytoplasmic extracts) were collected, and nuclear pellets were resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. Nuclei were lysed by the gradual addition of a one-tenth volume of 4 m (NH4)2SO4 over 30 min. For liver experiments, ∼50 mg of liver was Dounce-homogenized directly in hypotonic lysis buffer on ice 10 times with a tight piston. HepG2 cells were plated at 70,000 cells/well in 24-well plates and transfected on the following day with 25 ng of p6xCdx-TkLuc reporter gene (7Wolfrum C. Besser D. Luca E. Stoffel M. Proc. Natl.

Cells were harvested 40 h post-transfection, and luciferase was measured using the Dual Luciferase System (Promega). Primary hepatocytes from three mice were pooled and plated onto ten 10-cm collagen-treated plates. Cells were washed extensively and allowed to recover over 48 h after which they were infected with 2.5 × 107 plaque-forming units of the indicated virus. After 24 h, cells were serum-starved overnight followed by a 15-min stimulation in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin. For chromatin immunoprecipitation, 11% formaldehyde was added to the cells to a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were put on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and scraped in 1 ml of chromatin immunoprecipitation cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, with protease inhibitors). Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 5400 × g at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 450 μl of SDS lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology) and sonicated for 4 × 20 s on/30 s off at amplitude 16 on a Misonix Sonicator 4000. Lysates were further processed according to the manufacturer's protocol (chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit, Upstate Biotechnology). DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated overnight using 2.6 μg of HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-805) or rabbit IgG (ChromPure, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Primer sequences are available on request. Liver pieces were frozen directly in OCT (optimal cutting temperature) compound at −80 °C. 9 μm cryosections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, blocked in 5% normal donkey serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, and incubated with anti-HA antibody (1:25, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-805) overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. Donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) was used as a secondary antibody and mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting media with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) to visualize nuclei. Immunofluorescent staining was visualized with a Leica confocal microscope at ×40 magnification. Extraction of mRNA and cDNA synthesis were performed from 50 mg of liver tissue with the μMACS One-step cDNA Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer's protocol. PCR products were measured as a function of SYBR Green incorporation using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche Applied Science) and the Mx3005P Real-Time QPCR Detection System (Stratagene). Values shown are given in arbitrary units based on a standard curve and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Primer sequences are available on request. Retro-orbital blood samples were taken into nonheparinized capillary tubes. Blood glucose was measured using a standard glucometer (Ascensia Contour, Bayer). Plasma insulin was measured with the sensitive rat insulin RIA kit (Linco Research). Liver triglycerides were extracted by the Folch method and quantitated by colorimetric assay (Roche Applied Science). Mitochondria were isolated from 200 mg of PBS-perfused mouse livers by differential centrifugation as described previously (30Hoppel C. DiMarco J.P. Tandler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4164-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed the β-oxidation of [1-14C]palmitic acid by liver mitochondria in samples normalized to mitochondrial protein as described (31Fréneaux E. Labbe G. Letteron P. Dinh T.L. Degott C. Genève J. Larrey D. Pessayre D. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 1056-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). CO2 trapped on the filter papers was counted for 14C activity by scintillation counter. To measure ketone body formation, the incubation mixture was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min, and 14C-labeled acid-soluble products of mitochondrial palmitate metabolism were counted from an aliquot of the supernatant (31Fréneaux E. Labbe G. Letteron P. Dinh T.L. Degott C. Genève J. Larrey D. Pessayre D. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 1056-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Results are given as mean ± S.E. if not otherwise indicated. Statistical analyses were carried out by using a two-tailed Student's unpaired t test, and the null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). To identify possible mechanisms responsible for the nuclear export of Foxa2, we first established a robust assay to allow us to semiquantitatively determine the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of both endogenous and exogenous Foxa2. Whereas GFP fusion to Foxa2 abolished its insulin-induced nuclear export, HA-FLAG double-tagged Foxa2 was found to display normal export dynamics after insulin treatment when stably expressed in HepG2 cells (supplemental Fig. 1). We therefore used this assay to determine whether nuclear export of Foxa2 could be inhibited by the most common nuclear export factor, CRM1 (also called exportin1/Xpo1). Because CRM1-mediated nuclear export can be potently inhibited by the pharmacological agent LMB (32la Cour T. Gupta R. Rapacki K. Skriver K. Poulsen F.M. Brunak S. J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 33Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) we pretreated cells with 2.5 ng/ml LMB for 2 h prior to insulin stimulation and cellular fractionation. Analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts showed that LMB prevents the export of Foxa2 from the nucleus after stimulation with insulin, whereas untreated control cells display normal export dynamics (Fig. 1A). This finding demonstrates that nuclear export of Foxa2 is mediated by CRM1. To identify potential CRM1 regulatory sites in Foxa2, we performed a comparative analysis of the primary amino acid sequence using the generally accepted CRM1-mediated nuclear export signal (NES) consensus sequence LX2,3(L/I/V/F/M)X2,3LX(L/I) (32la Cour T. Gupta R. Rapacki K. Skriver K. Poulsen F.M. Brunak S. J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 34Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that Foxa2 contains one leucine-rich region at amino acid position 106–113 that closely resembles this consensus sequence (shown in Fig. 1B aligned to the prototypical HIV-REV NES). The region lies in the N-terminal half of Foxa2, about 40 amino acids upstream of the AKT phosphorylation site (Thr-156) between the transactivation and DNA binding domains, and is evolutionarily well conserved (Fig. 1, B and C). Consistent with the constitutively nuclear localization of Foxa1 and Foxa3, there was little to no sequence conservation observed in the region of these proteins corresponding to the Foxa2 NES (Fig. 1D). To elucidate whether the putative CRM1 NES is responsible for CRM1-mediated nuclear export of Foxa2 and thus important for its regulation in different physiological states, we performed mutational analyses. Because the C-terminal hydrophobic residues of the CRM1 consensus sequence have been shown to be the most critical for nuclear export (35Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), we mutated both terminal leucines (Leu-110 and Leu-113) of the putative Foxa2 NES to determine whether this sequence is necessary for nuclear exclusion in response to insulin. The L110A,L113A Foxa2 mutant (Fig. 1C, Emut) was stably expressed in HepG2 cells and analyzed for its ability to shuttle from the nucleus in response to insulin stimulation. Endogenous Foxa2 was used as an internal control. Whereas endogenous Foxa2 still shuttles in these cells in response to insulin stimulation, the export mutant remains nuclear, demonstrating that the NES is functional and necessary for export in vitro (Fig. 2A). To test whether this sequence is also necessary for export in vivo and thus might play an important role in the hormonal regulation of Foxa2 activity we generated a recombinant adenovirus-containing export mutant (Ad-Emut) Foxa2 and injected it into C57Bl/6 mice. As controls we treated mice with recombinant adenoviruses expressing wild-type (Ad-Foxa2) or phosphorylation-deficient constitutively active Foxa2 (Ad-T156A), which have been characterized previously (15Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). All constructs were HA- and FLAG-tagged, and a GFP-expressing adenovirus was used as an additional control. As shown in Fig. 2B, both endogenous and exogenous Foxa2 were nuclear in all fasted animals (plasma insulin 0.3 ± 0.05 ng/ml). However, although endogenous and Ad-Foxa2 were excluded from the nucleus in ad libitum fed animals (which exhibit 5–6- fold increased plasma insulin levels compared with the fasting state), the export mutant, as well as the T156A control, remained nuclear. Thus, the newly identified NES in Foxa2 is responsible for the active nuclear export of Foxa2 in hepatocytes both in vitro and in vivo. The ability to study the effect of phosphorylation uncoupled from subcellular localization of Foxa2 led us to ask whether regulation of Foxa2 activity by insulin is controlled mainly by nuclear export or by phosphorylation at Thr-156. To explore this possibility, we first sought to determine whether Emut Foxa2 could be efficiently phosphorylated through insulin signaling. Primary hepatocytes isolated from C57Bl/6 mice were infected with the corresponding adenoviruses and serum-starved overnight, followed by a 15-min incubation with insulin. Exogenous Foxa2 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to Western blot analysis. Western blots probed with an anti-Foxa2Thr-156-specific phosphopeptide antibody show that Emut Foxa2 is phosphorylated to a similar extent as wild-type Foxa2, suggesting a segregation of posttranslational modification and cellular localization. To further clarify this point, we generated recombinant adenovirus expressing a double Foxa2 mutant protein (Fig. 1C, TAE) containing both the Emut and T156A mutations. The T156A and TAE mutants, both of which lack the phosphorylation site and thus serve as negative controls, were not detected by the phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 3A). Because the export mutant is phosphorylated in response to insulin signaling, we hypothesized that, despite its nuclear localization, Foxa2 could still be inactivated by Akt-dependent phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we first expressed wild-type Foxa2, T156A, or Emut plasmids together with a reporter plasmid containing six Foxa binding sites of the murine Cdx-2 gene upstream of firefly luciferase (6xCdx), with or without AKT2, in HepG2 cells. Reporter assays showed that although the export mutant retained transcriptional activity under basal conditions, cotransfection with AKT ablated this activity to a similar extent as the wild type (Fig. 3B). As a control, the Foxa2-T156A remained fully active with or without AKT coexpression. These data demonstrate that, on a functional level, Foxa2 transcriptional activity is primarily regulated by posttranslational modification rather than by subcellular localization. To test whether these functional changes correlate with binding of Foxa2 to its target promoter regions, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations from C57Bl/6-derived primary hepatocytes infected with Ad-GFP, Ad-Foxa2, Ad-T156A, Ad-Emut, and Ad-TAEmut. In a serum-starved state, all Foxa2 constructs were able to bind to known Foxa2 interaction sites in CPT1, HMG-CoA synthase, and L-PK genes. However, after insulin stimulation, the wild type and export mutant constructs were no longer found to bind the target sites, whereas binding of the T156A and TAE mutant Foxa2 proteins was unaffected by insulin (Fig. 3C). These data confirm the results obtained from the transactivation assays and show that Thr-156 phosphorylation determines binding of Foxa2 to its responsive promoter elements and that cellular localization is a secondary effect. To assess the importance of nuclear export on the physiological activity of Foxa2 in the context of metabolic disorders, and to elucidate whether the biological activities of Foxa2 mutants show the same regulation in vivo, we expressed wild-type and mutant T156A, Emut, and TAE Foxa2 proteins in the livers of ob/ob mice using recombinant adenoviruses. We demonstrated previously that endogenous and Ad-Foxa2 are constitutively cytoplasmic and inactive in hyperinsulinemic mouse models of type 2 diabetes, whereas Ad-T156A remains in the nucleus and is able to restore Foxa2 activity (15Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from the livers of these mice"
https://openalex.org/W2047254877,"Background Chronic myocarditis is often initiated by viral infection, the most common of which is coxsackievirus infection. The precise mechanism by which viral infection leads to chronic autoimmune pathology is poorly understood, however it is clear that the early immune response plays a critical role. Previous results have shown that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 is integral to the development of experimental-induced autoimmune myocarditis. However, the function of IL-6 during viral-mediated autoimmunity has yet to be elucidated. Methods and Results To address the requirement of IL-6 during disease induction, IL-6 deficient mice were infected with coxsackievirus B3 (CB3). Following infection, mice lacking IL-6 developed increased chronic autoimmune disease pathology compared to wild type controls without a corresponding change in the level of viral replication in the heart. This increase in disease severity was accompanied by elevated levels of TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-10, activated T cells and cardiac infiltrating macrophage/monocytes. Injection of recombinant IL-6 early following infection in the IL-6 deficient mice was sufficient to lower the serum cytokines TNF-α and IL-10 as well as the serum chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1β, RANTES and MIG with a corresponding decrease in the chronic disease pathology strongly suggests an important regulatory role for IL-6 during the early response. Conclusions While IL-6 plays a pathogenic role in experimental-induced autoimmune disease, its function following viral-induced autoimmunity is not reprised. By regulating the early immune response and thereby controlling the severity of chronic disease, IL-6 directs the outcome of chronic autoimmune myocarditis."
https://openalex.org/W2019788194,"Background Making the correct choice between transcription elongation and transcription termination is essential to the function of RNA polymerase II, and fundamental to gene expression. This choice can be influenced by factors modifying the transcription complex, factors modifying chromatin, or signals mediated by the template or transcript. To aid in the study of transcription elongation and termination we have developed a transcription elongation reporter system that consists of tandem luciferase reporters flanking a test sequence of interest. The ratio of expression from the reporters provides a measure of the relative rates of successful elongation through the intervening sequence. Methodology/Principal Findings Size matched fragments containing the polyadenylation signal of the human β-actin gene (ACTB) and the human β-globin gene (HBB) were evaluated for transcription termination using this new ratiometric tandem reporter assay. Constructs bearing just 200 base pairs on either side of the consensus poly(A) addition site terminated 98% and 86% of transcription for ACTB and HBB sequences, respectively. The nearly 10-fold difference in read-through transcription between the two short poly(A) regions was eclipsed when additional downstream poly(A) sequence was included for each gene. Both poly(A) regions proved very effective at termination when 1100 base pairs were included, stopping 99.6% of transcription. To determine if part of the increased termination was simply due to the increased template length, we inserted several kilobases of heterologous coding sequence downstream of each poly(A) region test fragment. Unexpectedly, the additional length reduced the effectiveness of termination of HBB sequences 2-fold and of ACTB sequences 3- to 5-fold. Conclusions/Significance The tandem construct provides a sensitive measure of transcription termination in human cells. Decreased Xrn2 or Senataxin levels produced only a modest release from termination. Our data support overlap in allosteric and torpedo mechanisms of transcription termination and suggest that efficient termination is ensured by redundancy."
https://openalex.org/W2021200984,"Cyclosporin A (CsA) is an immunosuppressant that inhibits protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B/calcineurin) and is associated with hyperlipidemia, decreased cholesterol efflux via ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and increased risk of atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is an important regulator of lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, the secretion of which from human macrophages is regulated by the serine/threonine protein kinase A (PKA) and intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) (Kockx, M., Guo, D. L., Huby, T., Lesnik, P., Kay, J., Sabaretnam, T., Jary, E., Hill, M., Gaus, K., Chapman, J., Stow, J. L., Jessup, W., and Kritharides, L. (2007) Circ. Res. 101, 607-616). As PP2B is Ca(2+)-dependent and has been linked to PKA-dependent processes, we investigated whether CsA modulated apoE secretion. CsA dose- and time-dependently inhibited secretion of apoE from primary human macrophages and from Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with human apoE and increased cellular apoE levels without affecting apoE mRNA. [(35)S]Met kinetic modeling studies showed that CsA inhibited both secretion and degradation of apoE, increasing the half-life of cellular apoE 2-fold. CsA also inhibited secretion from primary human Tangier disease macrophages and from mouse macrophages deficient in ABCA1, indicating that the effect is independent of the known inhibition of ABCA1 by CsA. The role of PP2B in mediating apoE secretion was confirmed using additional peptide and chemical inhibitors of PP2B. Importantly, kinetic modeling, live-cell imaging, and confocal microscopy all indicated that CsA inhibited apoE secretion by mechanisms quite distinct from those of PKA inhibition, most likely inducing accumulation of apoE in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment. Taken together, these results establish a novel mechanism for the pro-atherosclerotic effects of CsA, and establish for the first time a role for PP2B in regulating the intracellular transport and secretion of apoE."

At 36 degrees C, cells arrested with abnormally thick, misplaced or supernumerary septa, indicating a defect late in septation. In addition to being Golgi associated, ectopically expressed GFP-tagged Pik1 was observed at the medial cell plane late in cytokinesis. New alleles, created by site-directed mutagenesis, were expressed ectopically. Lipid kinase and Cdc4-binding activity assays were performed. Pik1(D709A) was kinase-dead, but bound Cdc4. Pik1(R838A) did not bind Cdc4, but was an active kinase. Genomic integration of these substitutions in S. pombe and complementation studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae pik1-101 cells revealed that D709 is essential in both cases while R838 is dispensable. In S. pombe, ectopic expression of pik1 was dominantly lethal; while, pik1(D709A,R838A) was innocuous, pik1(R838A) was almost innocuous, and pik1(D709A) produced partial lethality and septation defects. The pik1 ectopic expression lethal phenotype was suppressed in cdc4(G107S). Thus, D709 is essential for kinase activity and septation.Pik1 kinase activity is required for septation.

We report here that Akt, activated downstream from ERK 1/2, was required for TGF-beta1-induced ZEBRA expression and enabled Smad3, a mediator of TGF-beta1 signaling, to be acetylated by direct interaction with the co-activator CREB-binding protein and then to regulate TGF-beta1-induced ZEBRA expression."
https://openalex.org/W2046437714,"Background Clinical treatments with typical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) are accompanied by extrapyramidal motor side-effects (EPS) such as hypokinesia and catalepsy. As little is known about electrophysiological substrates of such motor disturbances, we investigated the effects of a typical APD, α-flupentixol, on the motor behavior and the neuronal activity of the whole basal ganglia nuclei in the rat. Methods and Findings The motor behavior was examined by the open field actimeter and the neuronal activity of basal ganglia nuclei was investigated using extracellular single unit recordings on urethane anesthetized rats. We show that α-flupentixol induced EPS paralleled by a decrease in the firing rate and a disorganization of the firing pattern in both substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). Furthermore, α-flupentixol induced an increase in the firing rate of globus pallidus (GP) neurons. In the striatum, we recorded two populations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) after their antidromic identification. At basal level, both striato-pallidal and striato-nigral MSNs were found to be unaffected by α-flupentixol. However, during electrical cortico-striatal activation only striato-pallidal, but not striato-nigral, MSNs were found to be inhibited by α-flupentixol. Together, our results suggest that the changes in STN and SNr neuronal activity are a consequence of increased neuronal activity of globus pallidus (GP). Indeed, after selective GP lesion, α-flupentixol failed to induce EPS and to alter STN neuronal activity. Conclusion Our study reports strong evidence to show that hypokinesia and catalepsy induced by α-flupentixol are triggered by dramatic changes occurring in basal ganglia network. We provide new insight into the key role of GP in the pathophysiology of APD-induced EPS suggesting that the GP can be considered as a potential target for the treatment of EPS."
https://openalex.org/W2043281483,"Background Preeclampsia and coronary-artery disease share risk factors, suggesting common pathophysiological mechanisms. CX3CR1/CX3CL1 mediates leukocyte migration and adhesion and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several inflammatory diseases. M280/I249 variants of CX3CR1 are associated with an atheroprotective effect and reduced endothelial dysfunction. The aim of this study was to search for an association between V249I and T280M polymorphisms of CX3CR1, preeclampsia and endothelial dysfunction. Methodology/Principal Findings We explored these polymorphisms with real-time polymerase chain reaction in a case-control study (184 white women with preeclampsia and 184 matched normotensive pregnant women). Endothelial dysfunction biomarkers including von Willebrand factor, VCAM-1 and thrombomodulin, as well as the soluble form of CX3CL1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The I249 and M280 alleles were associated neither with preeclampsia, nor with its more severe form or with endothelial injury. In contrast, we found a trend toward increased CX3CL1 levels in preeclampsia patients, especially in early-onset- preeclampsia as compared to its level in later-onset- preeclampsia. Conclusions/Significance This is the first study to characterize the CX3CR1 gene polymorphisms in patients with preeclampsia. We found no differences in genotype or haplotype frequencies between patients with PE and normal pregnancies, suggesting that maternal CX3CR1 V249I and T280M polymorphisms do not increase susceptibility to preeclampsia. Further studies should be performed to directly evaluate the pathophysiological role of CX3CL1, a molecule abundantly expressed in endometrium, which has been shown to stimulate human trophoblast migration."

We have explored the role of polar or charged residues in the putative transmembrane domains of Hgt1p to obtain insights into the structural features of Hgt1p that govern its substrate specificity. A total of 22 charged and polar residues in the predicted transmembrane domains and other conserved regions were subjected to alanine mutagenesis.

The availability of the crystal structures of a few transporter proteins have further enabled direct visualization of such interactions between the key residues in the transmembrane domains and the substrate molecule (19.Oldham M.L.

In light of these studies we anticipated that few of the charged or polar residues in the predicted transmembrane domains of Hgt1p would be involved in substrate recognition and translocation across the membrane. Hence, a total of 22 polar or charged amino acids spanning the predicted transmembrane domains of Hgt1p were subjected to alanine scanning and functionally characterized. Detailed biochemical characterizations of these mutants revealed that Asn-124, Gln-222, Gln-526, Glu-544, Arg-554, and Lys-562 are key residues for the transport activity of Hgt1p. As replacement of Gln-222 in TMD4 and Gln-526 in TMD9 with alanine resulted in a significant decrease in the affinity of the transporter for glutathione, it suggested that the two residues might directly participate in glutathione recognition as a substrate. These observations provide the first insights into substrate binding residues in Hgt1p, a member of a novel and important transporter family (OPT family). All the chemicals used in this study were obtained from commercial sources and were of analytical grade. Media components, fine chemicals, and reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, HiMedia (Mumbai, India), Merck, USB Corp., or Difco. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Biobasic Inc. (Markham, ON, Canada). Restriction enzymes, Vent DNA polymerase, and TaqDNA polymerase and other DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs, (Beverly, MA). A DNA sequencing kit (ABI PRISM 3130 XL with dye termination cycle sequencing ready reaction kit) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Gel extraction kits and plasmid miniprep columns were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) or Sigma. [35S]GSH (specific activity 1000 Ci mmol−1) was purchased from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tag (6E2) mouse monoclonal antibody and horse anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody were bought from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Hybond ECL (nitrocellulose) membrane and ECL plus Western blotting detection reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used as a cloning host. The S. cerevisiae strain (ABC 817) bearing an HGT1 disruption in BY4741background (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 hgt1Δ::LEU2) is deficient in glutathione uptake ability and was used in the experimental studies (1.Bourbouloux A. Shahi P. Chakladar A. Delrot S. Bachhawat A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13259-13265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The yeast strain was regularly maintained on yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose medium and grown at 28–30 °C. The yeast transformants were selected and maintained on synthetic defined minimal medium containing yeast nitrogen base, ammonium sulfate dextrose supplemented with adenine, histidine, leucine, lysine, methionine, tryptophan, and uracil at 50 mg/liter as per requirement. Growth, handling of bacteria and yeast, and all the molecular techniques used in the study were according to standard protocols (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar, 24.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Simon M.I. Abelson J.N. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). The double-tagged HGT1, tagged with hexahistidine epitope at the N terminus and HA tag at the C terminus (9.Kaur J. Srikanth C.V. Bachhawat A.K. FEMS Yeast Res.2009Google Scholar), was subcloned downstream of the TEF promoter at BamHI and EcoRI site of a modified p416TEF vector (p416M1-TEF) in which all the restrictions sites flanking the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites have been removed by blunting and re-ligation. The resulting plasmid pTEFM1-His-HGT1-HA was used as a template to introduce two silent mutations to generate the restriction sites-MscI (1366) and XbaI (1584) in the wild-type HGT1 gene using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit with respective mutagenic oligonucleotides pairs given in supplemental Table 1. This modification generated a recombinant HGT1 gene that was unaltered in the encoded protein product but had additional restriction sites to facilitate cloning and screening of mutant DNA (Fig. 1). This modified gene product was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis for creation of different site-directed mutants of Hgt1p using either the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit or the splice overlap extension strategy. The different mutagenic oligonucleotides pairs used for generation of these mutants are given in supplemental Table 1. For using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit to generate the mutants, the double-tagged HGT1 (N-His-HGT1-HA) was subcloned into pBSK vector and used as a template together with different mutant primer pairs (supplemental Table 1) in mutagenic PCR set up as per the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting mutants were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired nucleotides changes and rule out any undesired mutations introduced during the mutagenic procedure. The fragments containing the mutations were subcloned back into the TEF vector background (pTEFM1-His-HGT1m-HA) using the appropriate restriction sites for subsequent analyses. While using the splice overlap extension strategy, the mutations were directly generated in the TEF vector background, and the resulting mutations were confirmed by sequencing the appropriate regions. The development of the assay and procedure has been described previously (9.Kaur J. Srikanth C.V. Bachhawat A.K. FEMS Yeast Res.2009Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast strain met15Δhgt1Δ (ABC 817) was transformed with a single copy, centromere vector expressing wild type, or different HGT1 mutants expressed downstream of the TEF promoter. Transformants were grown in minimal media containing methionine and other supplements without uracil overnight. These cultures were reinoculated in the same media and allowed to grow till they reached exponential phase. Equal numbers of cells were harvested, washed with water, and resuspended in sterile water to an A600 of 0.2. These were serially diluted 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000. 10 μl of these cell resuspensions were spotted on minimal medium containing different concentrations of glutathione (15, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200 μm) or methionine (200 μm) as the sole organic sulfur source. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days, and photographs were taken. Only the data obtained with 15, 50, and 200 μm GSH have been shown. met15Δhgt1Δ (ABC 817) strain transformed with different plasmid constructs bearing wild type or HGT1 mutants under the TEF promoter were grown in minimal media containing methionine and other supplements without uracil overnight. These cultures were reinoculated in the same media and allowed to grow till they reached exponential phase. Cells were harvested and washed and put on ice in a MES-buffered medium until the transport was initiated. Transport experiments were carried out with [35S]GSH as described earlier (1.Bourbouloux A. Shahi P. Chakladar A. Delrot S. Bachhawat A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13259-13265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The results were expressed as nmol of glutathione·mg·protein−1min−1. For the measurements of total protein, 100 μl of the above cell suspension (cell suspension volume used for the transport assay) was boiled with 15% sodium hydroxide for 10 min followed by neutralization of total cell lysate by the addition of hydrochloric acid. 100 μl of this crude cell lysate was incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and total protein was estimated by using the Bradford reagent (Sigma) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total crude cell preparation and immunoblot analysis was done as described previously (25.Kaur J. Bachhawat A.K. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 384: 348-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Densitometry analysis of the unsaturated band signals was performed using the Scion Image software to quantify the protein expression levels in different mutants. The resulting signal intensity was normalized with respect to the band surface area (in square pixels) and expressed in arbitrary units. The relative protein expression levels in the mutant Hgt1p were represented as percentage expression relative to wild-type Hgt1p. To localize Hgt1p and its different alanine mutants, indirect immunofluorescence was performed using a published protocol (26.Severance S. Chakraborty S. Kosman D.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 487-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Images were obtained with an inverted LSM510 META laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) fitted with a Plan-Apochromat ×100 (numerical aperture, 1.4) oil immersion objective. The 488-nm line of an argon ion laser was directed over an HFT UV/488 beam splitter, and fluorescence was detected using an NFT 490 beam splitter in combination with a BP 505–530 band pass filter. Images obtained were processed using Adobe Photoshop Version 5.5. The HGT1 open reading frame and Hgt1p sequences were retrieved from the Saccharomyces genome data base. The multiple sequence alignment of the protein sequences was generated using ClustalX program using default parameters (27.Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). For the prediction of transmembrane domains in Hgt1p, five different transmembrane prediction software programs were used: HMMTOP (28.Tusnády G.E. Simon I. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 849-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar), TMHMM (29.Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar), MEMSAT (30.Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), PHDHTM (31.Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and TopPRED II (32.Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar). The Hgt1p amino acid sequence was submitted as a query sequence, and predictions were made in default settings. A reasonably reliable topology model is a prerequisite for probing the role of amino acids in the transmembrane domains of Hgt1p. Previously, Becker and co-workers (33.Wiles A.M. Naider F. Becker J.M. Res. Microbiol. 2006; 157: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) predicted a topology model of Hgt1p with 12 transmembrane domains and extracellular N and C termini using topology prediction software in combination with multiple sequence alignment of the functionally characterized members of the OPT family (Fig. 1). Although the software predicted 14 transmembrane domains, the authors had omitted two of the predicted domains corresponding to the regions 537–568 and 707–724 citing the presence of conserved proline-rich motifs EXIXGYX2PG(R/K)PXAX4KX2G and PPX(N/T)P, respectively, in these regions. These motifs consist of proline residues in proximity to each other or a glycine residue, which theoretically disfavors a helix formation and, hence, were predicted to form loops in the predicted topology model (33.Wiles A.M. Naider F. Becker J.M. Res. Microbiol. 2006; 157: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have carried out an independent topology prediction analysis using also additional membrane protein topology prediction software reported in the literature. Our analysis leads us to concur with the Becker topology model of Hgt1p with the 12 transmembrane domains (data not shown). Hence, the predicted topology model has been used as a platform for the structure-functional analysis of Hgt1p. However, in the absence of any firm experimental evidence for excluding the two likely transmembrane domains spanning the regions 537–568 and 707–724 in Hgt1p, we have included these regions for our mutational study, while staying with the Wiles et al. (33.Wiles A.M. Naider F. Becker J.M. Res. Microbiol. 2006; 157: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) topology model of Hgt1p. In the absence of any previous hints on the important motifs or conserved amino acids in the transmembrane domains of Hgt1p (or any other member of the OPT family) that could be involved in substrate recognition, we adopted a comprehensive approach to identify the important residues or domains in Hgt1p that may play a specific role in substrate translocation. Glutathione, the substrate for Hgt1p, is a hydrophilic substrate, and prior studies on structural characterization of transporters of the other hydrophilic substrates have established that transmembrane domains lining the channels are rich in charged and polar residues. An examination of the 12 predicted transmembrane domains of Hgt1p revealed that each of these domains had at least one charged/polar residue in it, resulting in a total of 49 residues (Table 1). As the charged and polar residues that form a part of the permeability channel show a characteristic distribution where they often tend to cluster on one face of the helix (amphiphatic arrangement), helix wheel projections were drawn for each of the 12 transmembrane domains (supplemental Fig. 1). These helix wheel projections were analyzed for the presence and distribution of the charged and polar residues in these domains (supplemental Fig 1 and Table 1). Two of the 12 transmembrane domains (TMD 5 and TMD11) contained only a single polar residue, and hence, were not included in this study. TMD8 contains three polar residues, Gln-489, Cys-501, and Cys-502. However, the two cysteine residues in TMD8 are not crucial for the functional activity of Hgt1p (9.Kaur J. Srikanth C.V. Bachhawat A.K. FEMS Yeast Res.2009Google Scholar), and hence, the TMD8 was also not included in our mutational analysis of Hgt1p. Of the remaining 9 transmembrane domains, TMDs 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 12 have a clear distinction between the polar and nonpolar phase, and TMD3 is very rich in polar residues, which are scattered all around the helix. Hence, from these nine transmembrane domains, all the five charged residues in the predicted transmembrane domains (Glu-135, Arg-150, His-445, Glu-612, and Glu-744) were selected for mutational analysis in this study. With the remaining polar residues in the transmembrane domains, the following two criteria were used to select the residues; (a) restriction was made with respect to number of residues, selecting one or. at the most. two residues from each transmembrane domains so as to cover all the remaining nine transmembrane domains in Hgt1p, and (b) when picking more than one polar residue in a transmembrane domain, residues present in different faces of the helices were selected.TABLE 1Polar/charged residues in the transmembrane domains of Hgt1p and residues selected for alanine scanning in this studyTMDPolar/charged residue present in the domainResidue mutated to alanineTMD1 (109–127)Thr-109, Thr-113, Thr-114, Asn-124, Gln-125Thr-114, Asn-124TMD2 (134–155)Glu-135, Asn-137, Gln-142, Cys-145aThe cysteine residues have been subjected to mutagenesis analysis in an independent study (9)., Arg-150Glu-135, Asn-137, Arg-150TMD3 (179–200)Thr-182, Thr-188, Ser-189, Ser-190, Thr-191, Asn-199Thr-188, Ser-190TMD4 (212–232)Gln-214, Thr-220, Ser-221, Gln-222, Thr-232Gln-222TMD5 (277–296)Ser-285TMD6 (354–374)Ser-355, Asn-357, Thr-358, Ser-361, Cys-372aThe cysteine residues have been subjected to mutagenesis analysis in an independent study (9).Ser-355, Asn-57TMD7 (427–449)Ser-427, Ser-431, Asn-435, His-445, Cys-446aThe cysteine residues have been subjected to mutagenesis analysis in an independent study (9).Asn-435, His-445TMD8 (483–502)Gln-489, Cys-501aThe cysteine residues have been subjected to mutagenesis analysis in an independent study (9)., Cys-502aThe cysteine residues have been subjected to mutagenesis analysis in an independent study (9).TMD9 (509–529)Ser-519, Asn-522, Gln-526Gln-526Loop (537–568)Asn-540, Thr-543, Glu-544, Cys-547, Arg-554, Asn-558, Lys-562Glu-544, Arg-554, Lys-562TMD10 (591–613)Gln-596, Thr-600, Ser-603, Asn-607, Gln-611, Glu-612Ser-603, Asn-607, Glu-612TMD11 (661–679)Gln-679Loop (707–724)Thr-707, Asn-710, Ser-712, Ser-718, Cys-720aThe cysteine residues have been subjected to mutagenesis analysis in an independent study (9)., Asn-722Asn-710, Asn-722TMD12 (739–759)Glu-744, Ser-750, Cys-757aThe cysteine residues have been subjected to mutagenesis analysis in an independent study (9)., Gln-759Glu-744a The cysteine residues have been subjected to mutagenesis analysis in an independent study (9.Kaur J. Srikanth C.V. Bachhawat A.K. FEMS Yeast Res.2009Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab In addition, three of the highly conserved charged residues, Glu-544, Arg-554, and Lys-562, were selected from the region spanning 537–568, and two polar residues (Asn-710 and Asn-722) were selected from the region spanning 707–724. Thus a total of 22 amino acids representative of 9 transmembrane domains of Hgt1p and 2 intracellular loops were mutagenized to the alanine residue and evaluated for the functional activity (Fig. 1 and Table 1). A preliminary characterization of the alanine mutants of Hgt1p was done using a plate-based dual complementation-cum-toxicity assay, previously designed for the rapid evaluation of the functional activity of the mutants of the transporter (9.Kaur J. Srikanth C.V. Bachhawat A.K. FEMS Yeast Res.2009Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay is based upon the dual behavior of Hgt1p, expressed from TEF promoter in a met15Δhgt1Δ strain, an organic sulfur auxotroph defective in glutathione uptake. While at low glutathione concentrations (15 μm or lower), HGT1 expressed under the TEF promoter complements the growth defect in a met15Δhgt1Δ strain very well (1.Bourbouloux A. Shahi P. Chakladar A. Delrot S. Bachhawat A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13259-13265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the same construct results in toxicity when cells are grown in medium containing 30 μm or higher glutathione concentrations (34.Srikanth C.V. Vats P. Bourbouloux A. Delrot S. Bachhawat A.K. Curr. Genet. 2005; 47: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the assay is used to evaluate the functional activity of Hgt1p with respect to two parameters. (a) ability to complement the GSH transport defect of the strain met15Δhgt1Δ at low concentrations of GSH and (b) the ability to cause toxicity in media containing higher concentrations of GSH. The plasmids bearing wild-type Hgt1p or with the mutated residue in Hgt1p were individually transformed into the met15Δhgt1Δ strain (ABC 817) and checked for growth by dilution spotting on minimal media containing a range of glutathione concentrations as the sole source of organic sulfur (Fig. 2). Functional evaluation of the mutations in Hgt1p using the plate assay identified four subgroups, (a) severe effect (complementation-defective at 15 μm GSH, no toxicity at higher GSH concentrations; those mutants showing significant loss in activity as reflected by loss in ability to complement hgt1Δ defect at low glutathione concentrations), (b) moderate effect (complementation-positive at 15 μm GSH, no toxicity at higher GSH concentrations; mutants that permitted growth at higher glutathione concentration, i.e. no toxicity is observed in the"
https://openalex.org/W2084389952,"Background The Ribosomal protein S19 gene locus (RPS19) has been linked to two kinds of red cell aplasia, Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA) and Transient Erythroblastopenia in Childhood (TEC). Mutations in RPS19 coding sequences have been found in 25% of DBA patients, but not in TEC patients. It has been suggested that non-coding RPS19 sequence variants contribute to the considerable clinical variability in red cell aplasia. We therefore aimed at identifying non-coding variations associated with DBA or TEC phenotypes. Methodology/Principal Findings We targeted a region of 19'980 bp encompassing the RPS19 gene in a cohort of 89 DBA and TEC patients for resequencing. We provide here a catalog of the considerable, previously unrecognized degree of variation in this region. We identified 73 variations (65 SNPs, 8 indels) that all are located outside of the RPS19 open reading frame, and of which 67.1% are classified as novel. We hypothesize that specific alleles in non-coding regions of RPS19 could alter the binding of regulatory proteins or transcription factors. Therefore, we carried out an extensive analysis to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). A series of putative interaction sites coincide with detected variants. Sixteen of the corresponding transcription factors are of particular interest, as they are housekeeping genes or show a direct link to hematopoiesis, tumorigenesis or leukemia (e.g. GATA-1/2, PU.1, MZF-1). Conclusions Specific alleles at predicted TFBSs may alter the expression of RPS19, modify an important interaction between transcription factors with overlapping TFBS or remove an important stimulus for hematopoiesis. We suggest that the detected interactions are of importance for hematopoiesis and could provide new insights into individual response to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2003669849,"The superantigen SEA causes non-specific hyperactivation of T and B cells at low concentrations. Studies of mutants or soluble proteins suggest SEA is bivalent for its ligand, MHC class II. However, the interaction between these molecules on intact cells is unknown. On primary mouse B cells expressing the MHC class II allele HLA-DR1, measurements of Förster Resonance Energy Transfer between HLA-DR1 molecules on SEA-treated cells indicated specific clustering, not observed in untreated or monovalent superantigen treated cells. Tomographic visualization and electron microscopy of immunogold-labeled SEA-treated B cells revealed small clusters of surface HLA-DR1 (≤4 gold labels). These results present direct visual evidence of SEA-mediated clustering of MHC class II molecules on treated antigen presenting cells, and provide a new structural approach to addressing problems of this nature."
https://openalex.org/W2025102101,"Background DNA damage checkpoints insure that the integrity of genomic DNA is faithfully maintained throughout the eukaryotic cell cycle. In the presence of damaged DNA, checkpoints are triggered to delay cell cycle progression to allow for DNA repair. In fission yeast, the kinases Chk1 and Cds1 are major components of these DNA damage checkpoint pathways. Both Chk1 and Cds1 are important for viability in the presence of several DNA damaging agents. In this study we hypothesized that Chk1 and Cds1 play a vital role in fission yeast cells ability to survive exposure to the DNA damaging agent cisplatin. Cisplatin is a potent chemotherapeutic drug that interacts with DNA and causes both inter- and intra-strand DNA cross-links. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we demonstrated that treatment with cisplatin in fission yeast causes a Chk1-dependent DNA damage signal. chk1− cells were sensitive to cisplatin and Chk1 was phosphorylated in response to cisplatin treatment. We also showed that a Chk1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint pathway is activated in a dose-dependent fashion in cells challenged with cisplatin. Furthermore the Cds1 checkpoint kinase was also important for viability in cisplatin challenged cells. In cds1− cells, cisplatin treatment reduced cell viability and this phenotype was exacerbated in a chk1−/cds1− background. Conclusions/Significance Thus, we conclude that the concerted effort of both major checkpoint kinases in fission yeast, Chk1 and Cds1, protect cells from cisplatin induced DNA damage. These observations are significant because they suggest that various classes of inter-strand crosslinking agents may generate slightly different lesions as work by others did not observe loss of viability in cds1− cells treated with other crosslinking agents like nitrogen mustard."
