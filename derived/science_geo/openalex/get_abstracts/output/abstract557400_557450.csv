https://openalex.org/W2335345046,"Activation of various cell surface receptors triggers the reorganization of downstream signaling molecules into micrometer- or submicrometer-sized clusters. However, the functional consequences of such clustering have been unclear. We biochemically reconstituted a 12-component signaling pathway on model membranes, beginning with T cell receptor (TCR) activation and ending with actin assembly. When TCR phosphorylation was triggered, downstream signaling proteins spontaneously separated into liquid-like clusters that promoted signaling outputs both in vitro and in human Jurkat T cells. Reconstituted clusters were enriched in kinases but excluded phosphatases and enhanced actin filament assembly by recruiting and organizing actin regulators. These results demonstrate that protein phase separation can create a distinct physical and biochemical compartment that facilitates signaling."

Optical multiplexing frequency, brightness, and polarization have played crucial roles in information technologies, high-capacity data storage, high-speed communications, and biological sensing. Angular momentum is another degree of freedom that could increase capacity further. Typically, however, the bulk optical elements used to determine the angular momentum of light limit possible on-chip processing. Ren et al. take a nanophotonics approach to measure and sort light co-propagating with different states of angular momentum (see the Perspective by Molina-Terriza). The approach is promising for on-chip multiplex processing of optical signals. Science , this issue p. 805 ; see also p. 774"
https://openalex.org/W2326269909,"We report a mechanism through which the transcription machinery directly controls topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) activity to adjust DNA topology throughout the transcription cycle. By comparing TOP1 occupancy using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) versus TOP1 activity using topoisomerase 1 sequencing (TOP1-seq), a method reported here to map catalytically engaged TOP1, TOP1 bound at promoters was discovered to become fully active only after pause-release. This transition coupled the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal-domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with stimulation of TOP1 above its basal rate, enhancing its processivity. TOP1 stimulation is strongly dependent on the kinase activity of BRD4, a protein that phosphorylates Ser2-CTD and regulates RNAPII pause-release. Thus the coordinated action of BRD4 and TOP1 overcame the torsional stress opposing transcription as RNAPII commenced elongation but preserved negative supercoiling that assists promoter melting at start sites. This nexus between transcription and DNA topology promises to elicit new strategies to intercept pathological gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2326008849,"Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) have the capacity to self-renew and propagate disease upon serial transplantation in animal models, and elimination of this cell population is required for curative therapies. Here, we describe a series of pooled, in vivo RNAi screens to identify essential transcription factors (TFs) in a murine model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with genetically and phenotypically defined LSCs. These screens reveal the heterodimeric, circadian rhythm TFs Clock and Bmal1 as genes required for the growth of AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Disruption of canonical circadian pathway components produces anti-leukemic effects, including impaired proliferation, enhanced myeloid differentiation, and depletion of LSCs. We find that both normal and malignant hematopoietic cells harbor an intact clock with robust circadian oscillations, and genetic knockout models reveal a leukemia-specific dependence on the pathway. Our findings establish a role for the core circadian clock genes in AML."
https://openalex.org/W2313634983,"Regulation of enhancer activity is important for controlling gene expression programs. Here, we report that a biochemical complex containing a potential chromatin reader, RACK7, and the histone lysine 4 tri-methyl (H3K4me3)-specific demethylase KDM5C occupies many active enhancers, including almost all super-enhancers. Loss of RACK7 or KDM5C results in overactivation of enhancers, characterized by the deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac, together with increased transcription of eRNAs and nearby genes. Furthermore, loss of RACK7 or KDM5C leads to de-repression of S100A oncogenes and various cancer-related phenotypes. Our findings reveal a RACK7/KDM5C-regulated, dynamic interchange between histone H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 at active enhancers, representing an additional layer of regulation of enhancer activity. We propose that RACK7/KDM5C functions as an enhancer ""brake"" to ensure appropriate enhancer activity, which, when compromised, could contribute to tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2331025381,"Background A large proportion of mindfulness-based therapy trials report statistically significant results, even in the context of very low statistical power. The objective of the present study was to characterize the reporting of “positive” results in randomized controlled trials of mindfulness-based therapy. We also assessed mindfulness-based therapy trial registrations for indications of possible reporting bias and reviewed recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses to determine whether reporting biases were identified. Methods CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and SCOPUS databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of mindfulness-based therapy. The number of positive trials was described and compared to the number that might be expected if mindfulness-based therapy were similarly effective compared to individual therapy for depression. Trial registries were searched for mindfulness-based therapy registrations. CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and SCOPUS were also searched for mindfulness-based therapy systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Results 108 (87%) of 124 published trials reported ≥1 positive outcome in the abstract, and 109 (88%) concluded that mindfulness-based therapy was effective, 1.6 times greater than the expected number of positive trials based on effect size d = 0.55 (expected number positive trials = 65.7). Of 21 trial registrations, 13 (62%) remained unpublished 30 months post-trial completion. No trial registrations adequately specified a single primary outcome measure with time of assessment. None of 36 systematic reviews and meta-analyses concluded that effect estimates were overestimated due to reporting biases. Conclusions The proportion of mindfulness-based therapy trials with statistically significant results may overstate what would occur in practice."
https://openalex.org/W2321917741,"We previously demonstrated that short-term oral administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri 6475 enhanced bone density in male but not female mice. We also established that L. reuteri 6475 enhanced bone health and prevented bone loss in estrogen-deficient female mice. In this study, we tested whether a mild inflammatory state and/or a long-term treatment with the probiotic was required to promote a positive bone effect in estrogen-sufficient female mice.A mild inflammatory state was induced in female mice by dorsal surgical incision (DSI). Following DSI animals were orally supplemented with L. reuteri or vehicle control for a period of 8 weeks. Gene expression was measured in the intestine and bone marrow by qPCR. Distal femoral bone density and architecture was analyzed by micro-CT.We report that 8 weeks after DSI there is a significant increase in the weight of spleen, thymus and visceral (retroperitoneal) fat pads. Expression of intestinal cytokines and tight junction proteins are also altered 8 weeks post-DSI. Interestingly, L. reuteri treatment was found to display both intestinal region- and inflammation-dependent effects. Unexpectedly we identified that 1) L. reuteri treatment increased bone density in females but only in those that underwent DSI and 2) DSI benefited cortical bone parameters. In the bone marrow, dorsal surgery induced CD4+ T cell numbers, a response that was unaffected by L. reuteri treatment, whereas expression of RANKL, OPG and IL-10 were significantly affected by L. reuteri treatment.Our data reveals a previously unappreciated effect of a mild surgical procedure causing a long-lasting effect on inflammatory gene expression in the gut and the bone. Additionally, we demonstrate that in intact female mice, the beneficial effect of L. reuteri on bone requires an elevated inflammatory status."
https://openalex.org/W2325192759,"BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers (CCs) have a characteristic gene expression signature that is also found in some tumors lacking this mutation. Collectively, they are referred to as ""BRAF-like"" tumors and represent some 20% of CCs. We used a shRNA-based genetic screen focused on genes upregulated in BRAF(V600E) CCs to identify vulnerabilities of this tumor subtype that might be exploited therapeutically. Here, we identify RANBP2 (also known as NUP358) as essential for survival of BRAF-like, but not for non-BRAF-like, CC cells. Suppression of RANBP2 results in mitotic defects only in BRAF-like CC cells, leading to cell death. Mechanistically, RANBP2 silencing reduces microtubule outgrowth from the kinetochores, thereby inducing spindle perturbations, providing an explanation for the observed mitotic defects. We find that BRAF-like CCs display far greater sensitivity to the microtubule poison vinorelbine both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that vinorelbine is a potential tailored treatment for BRAF-like CCs."
https://openalex.org/W2322444674,"Heading date in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other small grain cereals is affected by the vernalization and photoperiod pathways. The reduced-height loci also have an effect on growth and development. Heading date, which occurs just prior to anthesis, was evaluated in a population of 299 hard winter wheat entries representative of the U.S. Great Plains region, grown in nine environments during 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. The germplasm was evaluated for candidate genes at vernalization (Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, and Vrn-D1), photoperiod (Ppd-A1, Ppd-B1 and Ppd-D1), and reduced-height (Rht-B1 and Rht-D1) loci using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assays. Our objectives were to determine allelic variants known to affect flowering time, assess the effect of allelic variants on heading date, and investigate changes in the geographic and temporal distribution of alleles and haplotypes. Our analyses enhanced understanding of the roles developmental genes have on the timing of heading date in wheat under varying environmental conditions, which could be used by breeding programs to improve breeding strategies under current and future climate scenarios. The significant main effects and two-way interactions between the candidate genes explained an average of 44% of variability in heading date at each environment. Among the loci we evaluated, most of the variation in heading date was explained by Ppd-D1, Ppd-B1, and their interaction. The prevalence of the photoperiod sensitive alleles Ppd-A1b, Ppd-B1b, and Ppd-D1b has gradually decreased in U.S. Great Plains germplasm over the past century. There is also geographic variation for photoperiod sensitive and reduced-height alleles, with germplasm from breeding programs in the northern Great Plains having greater incidences of the photoperiod sensitive alleles and lower incidence of the semi-dwarf alleles than germplasm from breeding programs in the central or southern plains."

Mechanistic studies of the membrane disruption process at a high-resolution level, on the other hand, are hindered by the co-existence of multiple possible pathways, even in simplified model systems such as the phospholipid liposome. Therefore, separation of these pathways is crucial to achieve an in-depth understanding of the Aβ-induced membrane disruption process. This study, which utilized a combination of multiple biophysical techniques, shows that the peptide-to-lipid (P:L) molar ratio is an important factor that regulates the selection of dominant membrane disruption pathways in the presence of 40-residue Aβ peptides in liposomes. Three distinct pathways (fibrillation with membrane content leakage, vesicle fusion, and lipid uptake through a temporarily stable ionic channel) become dominant in model liposome systems under specific conditions. These individual systems are characterized by both the initial states of Aβ peptides and the P:L molar ratio. Our results demonstrated the possibility to generate simplified Aβ-membrane model systems with a homogeneous membrane disruption pathway, which will benefit high-resolution mechanistic studies in the future. Fundamentally, the possibility of pathway selection controlled by P:L suggests that the driving forces for Aβ aggregation and Aβ-membrane interactions may be similar at the molecular level.

https://openalex.org/W2314339084,"Throughout cell-cycle progression, the expression of multiple transcripts oscillate, and whether these are under the centralized control of the CDK-APC/C proteins or can be driven by a de-centralized transcription factor (TF) cascade is a fundamental question for understanding cell-cycle regulation. In budding yeast, we find that the transcription of nearly all genes, as assessed by RNA-seq or fluorescence microscopy in single cells, is dictated by CDK-APC/C. Three exceptional genes are transcribed in a pulsatile pattern in a variety of CDK-APC/C arrests. Pursuing one of these transcripts, the SIC1 inhibitor of B-type cyclins, we use a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation to provide evidence that, counter-intuitively, Sic1 provides a failsafe mechanism promoting nuclear division when levels of mitotic cyclins are low."

Previously, we suggested that pharmaceuticals activate CYP46A1 allosterically through binding to a site on the cytosolic protein surface, which is different from the enzyme active site facing the membrane. Here we identified this allosteric site for efavirenz on CYP46A1 by using a combination of hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to MS, computational modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and analysis of the CYP46A1 crystal structure. We also mapped the binding region for the CYP46A1 redox partner oxidoreductase and found that the allosteric and redox partner binding sites share a common border.

https://openalex.org/W2325017024,"Epidemiological observations of urban inhalation exposures to diesel exhaust (DE) and ozone (O3) have shown pre-clinical cardiopulmonary responses in humans. Identifying the key biological mechanisms that initiate these health bioindicators is difficult due to variability in environmental exposure in time and from person to person. Previously, environmentally controlled human exposure chambers have been used to study DE and O3 dose-response patterns separately, but investigation of co-exposures has not been performed under controlled conditions. Because a mixture is a more realistic exposure scenario for the general public, in this study we investigate the relationships of urban levels of urban-level DE exposure (300 μg/m3), O3 (0.3 ppm), DE + O3 co-exposure, and innate immune system responses. Fifteen healthy human volunteers were studied for changes in ten inflammatory cytokines (interleukins 1β, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12p70 and 13, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) and counts of three white blood cell types (lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils) following controlled exposures to DE, O3, and DE+O3. The results show subtle cytokines responses to the diesel-only and ozone-only exposures, and that a more complex (possibly synergistic) relationship exists in the combination of these two exposures with suppression of IL-5, IL-12p70, IFN-γ, and TNF-α that persists up to 22-hours for IFN-γ and TNF-α. The white blood cell differential counts showed significant monocyte and lymphocyte decreases and neutrophil increases following the DE + O3 exposure; lymphocytes and neutrophils changes also persist for at least 22-hours. Because human studies must be conducted under strict safety protocols at environmental levels, these effects are subtle and are generally only seen with detailed statistical analysis. This study indicates that the observed associations between environmental exposures and cardiopulmonary effects are possibly mediated by inflammatory response mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2334461024,"Culex pipiens is the most cosmopolitan mosquito of the Pipiens Assemblage. By studying the nature of interactions between this species and microorganisms common to its breeding environment we can unravel important pitfalls encountered during development. We tested the survival rate of larval stages, pupae and adults of a Cx. pipiens colony exposed to a variety of microorganisms in laboratory conditions and assessed the transmission to offspring (F1) by those organisms that secured development up to adulthood. Three complementary experiments were designed to: 1) explore the nutritional value of yeasts and other microorganisms during Cx. pipiens development; 2) elucidate the transstadial transmission of yeast to the host offspring; and 3) to examine the relevance of all these microorganisms in female choice for oviposition-substratum. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proved to be the most nutritional diet, but despite showing the highest survival rates, vertical transmission to F1 was never confirmed. In addition, during the oviposition trials, none of the gravid females was attracted to the yeast substratum. Notably, the two native bacterial strains, Klebsiella sp. and Aeromonas sp., were the preferred oviposition media, the same two bacteria that managed to feed neonates until molting into 2nd instar larvae. Our results not only suggest that Klebsiella sp. or Aeromonas sp. serve as attractants for oviposition habitat selection, but also nurture the most fragile instar, L1, to assure molting into a more resilient stage, L2, while yeast proves to be the most supportive diet for completing development. These experiments unearthed survival traits that might be considered in the future development of strategies of Cx. pipiens control. These studies can be extended to other members of the Pipiens Assemblage."
https://openalex.org/W2319471485,"Dimerization of single span transmembrane receptors underlies their mechanism of activation. p75 neurotrophin receptor plays an important role in the nervous system, but the understanding of p75 activation mechanism is still incomplete. The transmembrane (TM) domain of p75 stabilizes the receptor dimers through a disulfide bond, essential for the NGF signaling. Here we solved by NMR the three-dimensional structure of the p75-TM-WT and the functionally inactive p75-TM-C257A dimers. Upon reconstitution in lipid micelles, p75-TM-WT forms the disulfide-linked dimers spontaneously. Under reducing conditions, p75-TM-WT is in a monomer-dimer equilibrium with the Cys257 residue located on the dimer interface. In contrast, p75-TM-C257A forms dimers through the AXXXG motif on the opposite face of the α-helix. Biochemical and cross-linking experiments indicate that AXXXG motif is not on the dimer interface of p75-TM-WT, suggesting that the conformation of p75-TM-C257A may be not functionally relevant. However, rather than mediating p75 homodimerization, mutagenesis of the AXXXG motif reveals its functional role in the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of p75 catalyzed by the γ-secretase complex. Our structural data provide an insight into the key role of the Cys257 in stabilization of the weak transmembrane dimer in a conformation required for the NGF signaling."

Cone mosaic was captured at 0° and 2°eccentricities along the horizontal and vertical meridians. The density of the parafoveal cones was calculated within 100×100-μm squares located at 500-μm from the foveal center along the orthogonal meridians. Manual corrections of the automated counting were then performed by 2 masked graders. Cone density measurements were evaluated with ANOVA that consisted of one between-subjects factor, stage of retinopathy and the within-subject factors. The ANOVA model included a complex covariance structure to account for correlations between the levels of the within-subject factors.Ten healthy participants (20 eyes) and 25 patients (29 eyes) with type II diabetes mellitus were recruited in the study. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age of the healthy participants (Control group), patients with diabetes without retinopathy (No DR group), and patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR group) was 55 ± 8, 53 ± 8, and 52 ± 9 years, respectively. The cone density was significantly lower in the moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and severe NPDR/proliferative DR groups compared to the Control, No DR, and mild NPDR groups (P < 0.05). No correlation was found between cone density and the level of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or the duration of diabetes.The extent of photoreceptor loss on AO imaging may correlate positively with severity of DR in patients with type II diabetes mellitus. Photoreceptor loss may be more pronounced among patients with advanced stages of DR due to higher risk of macular edema and its sequelae."

Here we asked whether directly activating single αIIbβ3 molecules in platelets using the designed peptide anti-αIIb TM also initiates αIIbβ3-mediated outside-in signaling by causing activation of β3-associated c-Src. Anti-αIIb TM caused activation of β3-associated c-Src and the kinase Syk, but not the kinase FAK, under conditions that precluded extracellular ligand binding to αIIbβ3. c-Src and Syk are activated by trans-autophosphorylation, suggesting that activation of individual αIIbβ3 molecules can initiate αIIbβ3 clustering in the absence of ligand binding.

We detected little to no interaction in unstimulated platelets, but following platelet stimulation with thrombin, c-Src associated with β3 in a time-dependent manner and underwent transient activation. We also found that the β3 CT binds to the c-Src SH3 domain at a site that is occupied by the linker connecting the c-Src SH2 and kinase domains in inactive c-Src. Following platelet activation, c-Src is “unlatched,” allowing β3 CT binding to the SH3 domain when the linker binding site is vacated. However, the full catalytic activity of c-Src requires phosphorylation of Tyr419 (numbered according to the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry P12931 for human c-Src), located in a loop between the two lobes of the c-Src kinase domain (7Xu W.

Moreover, these peptides activate αIIbβ3 in platelets in the absence of inside-out signaling. Thus, they provide a way to test whether directly activating individual αIIbβ3 molecules can also cause αIIbβ3 clustering. Here we used the computationally designed peptide anti-αIIb TM (11Yin H. Slusky J.S. Berger B.W. Walters R.S. Vilaire G. Litvinov R.I. Lear J.D. Caputo G.A. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F.

We found that anti-αIIb TM caused αIIbβ3-dependent c-Src activation under conditions that preclude ligand binding to αIIbβ3 and platelet actin polymerization. These results suggest that not only is resting αIIbβ3 poised to undergo a conformational change that exposes its ligand binding site, but it is poised to rapidly oligomerize into intracellular signal-generating complexes as well.

Five equivalents of HBTU coupling reagent (Pepnet) and five equivalents of amino acid (ChemPep) were used per coupling. Each coupling was performed in duplicate with a coupling time of 2 min. After cleavage and workup, peptides with an amidized C terminus and a free amino N terminus were characterized using a Perseptive Biosystems MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.

Fractions were characterized with MALDI mass spectrometry and lyophilized to dryness. The purity of each product was verified by HPLC. Human platelet studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania Office of Regulatory Affairs. Platelet aggregation and ATP secretion were measured using a Chrono-Log model 700 lumi-aggregometer (10Yin H. Litvinov R.I. Vilaire G. Zhu H. Li W. Caputo G.A. Moore D.T. Lear J.D. Weisel J.W.

Human platelets, obtained from blood anticoagulated with sodium citrate (65 mm), citric acid (77 mm), and glucose (95 mm) (pH 4.4) were washed with 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 6.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 1 μm PGE1, and 0.3 units/ml apyrase and resuspended in modified Tyrode’s buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.35) containing 135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 3 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, and 0.1% BSA). 450-μl aliquots of the platelet suspension supplemented with 200 μg/ml human fibrinogen and 1 mm CaCl2 were stirred at 1200 rpm in siliconized aggregometer cuvettes. Secreted ATP secretion was measured using 50 μl of CHRONO-LUMETM reagent (firefly luciferin-luciferase) and analyzed using AGGRO/LINK8® software. Membrane-soluble peptides were dissolved in DMSO solution, and final DMSO concentrations were no greater than 0.5%. FITC-conjugated fibrinogen binding to washed platelets was measured as described previously (14Basani R.B. D'Andrea G. Mitra N. Vilaire G. Richberg M. Kowalska M.A. Bennett J.S. Poncz M. RGD-containing peptides inhibit fibrinogen binding to platelet α(IIb)β3 by inducing an allosteric change in the amino-terminal portion of α(IIb).J. Biol.

Briefly, 500-μl aliquots of the washed platelets were stimulated in the presence of 200 μg/ml FITC-conjugated fibrinogen. The platelets were then fixed with 0.37% formalin in PBS buffer for 10 min, washed, and examined by FACS. 500-μl aliquots of washed or gel-filtered human platelets (15Bennett J.S. Vilaire G. Exposure of platelet fibrinogen receptors by ADP and epinephrine.J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) were incubated with 10 μg/ml collagen, 1 unit/ml thrombin, or 2 μm anti-αIIb TM for 1 min at 37 °C, after which the platelets were lysed with 125 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture, Sigma-Aldrich; phosphatase inhibitor mixture set III, Millipore). In some experiments, proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysates, separated in 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (IB301001, Life Technologies) for immunoblotting. Immunoblotted proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG and ECL Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). β3 was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with either the β3-specific mAb SSA6 (16Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. Examination of the platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex and its interaction with fibrinogen and other ligands by electron microscopy.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the mAb D-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). c-Src was immunoblotted with the antibody 36D10 (Cell Signaling Technology), and phosphorylated c-Src residue 419 (Tyr(P)419) was detected with antibody 2101 (Cell Signaling Technology). Syk was immunoprecipitated using the mAb G-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and FAK using the mAb 4.47 (Merck Millipore). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Syk and FAK were detected by immunoblotting with 4G10 (Merck Millipore). Talin was immunoblotted using mAb TA205 (Merck Millipore). Kindlin-3 antibodies were prepared against a kindlin-3 C-terminal peptide, C-GEELDEDLFLQLTG (residues 645–658), containing an N-terminal cysteine residue for coupling to maleimide-activated blue carrier protein (Pierce/Thermo Fisher). Monospecific polyclonal antibodies were then produced in rabbits by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). After initial immunoblotting, membranes were stripped of protein-bound antibody using Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad), and immunoblotted again for either β3 using D-11, c-Src using 36D10, or FAK using 4.47. To visualize αIIbβ3 on the surface of resting platelets and platelets incubated with anti-αIIb TM, washed human platelets were resuspended at a concentration of 2.5 × 108 platelets/ml in Tyrode’s buffer containing 5 mm EDTA but without BSA. 500-μl aliquots of the platelet suspension were then transferred to BSA-blocked centrifuge tubes and incubated for 1 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 2 μm anti-αIIb TM (8Li R. Mitra N. Gratkowski H. Vilaire G. Litvinov R. Nagasami C. Weisel J.W. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. Activation of integrin aIIbb3 by modulation of transmembrane helix associations.Science. 2003; 300: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Following the incubation, the platelets were fixed by adding 500 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and transferred to poly-lysine-coated chamber glass slides. The platelet-containing chambers were then incubated sequentially with 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature and with the anti-β3 mAb SSA6 labeled with Alexa Fluor® 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the stained platelets were mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) and visualized using a Zeiss Axioplan upright microscope with a Zeiss FluoArc mercury lamp. Images were captured using a Zeiss AxioCam HRm high-resolution monochrome charge-coupled device camera and AxioVision 4.5 software (Zeiss). To address whether c-Src is involved in platelet function stimulated by anti-αIIb TM, we compared the effects of the peptide to the effects of low and high concentrations of thrombin on the function of normal platelets in the absence and presence of the c-Src inhibitor PP2. As shown in Fig. 2A, 2 μm anti-αIIb TM caused both platelet aggregation and ATP secretion. However, 10 μm PP2 attenuated anti-αIIb TM-induced platelet aggregation and abrogated peptide-induced platelet ATP secretion. Likewise, both platelet aggregation and ATP secretion stimulated by 0.1 units/ml thrombin were inhibited by 10 μm PP2. By contrast, when platelets were stimulated by thrombin at 5 units/ml, 10 μm PP2 had no effect on ATP secretion, although platelet aggregation was modestly attenuated. Thus, as noted previously by Liu et al. (17Liu J. Jackson C.W. Gartner T.K. The Src requirement for washed platelet aggregation and dense granule secretion in response to stimulation by a low level of γ-thrombin.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 6: 1035-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), when platelets were stimulated by γ-thrombin, c-Src activation appears to potentiate the effects of weaker platelet stimuli such as anti-αIIb TM and 0.1 units/ml thrombin, but increasing the strength of the platelet stimulus, in this case increasing the thrombin concentration to 5 units/ml, largely bypasses the c-Src requirement. Next we asked whether the effects of anti-αIIb TM on platelets require the presence of αIIbβ3 by measuring ATP secretion from the platelets of a well characterized patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) whose platelets lack αIIbβ3 (18Poncz M. Rifat S. Coller B.S. Newman P.J. Shattil S.J. Parrella T. Fortina P. Bennett J.S. Glanzmann thrombasthenia secondary to a Gly273ÆAsp mutation adjacent to the first calcium-binding domain of platelet glycoprotein IIb.J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although 0.1 units/ml thrombin caused brisk ATP secretion from the GT platelets, an anti-αIIb TM concentration that caused robust ATP secretion from normal platelets, had no effect on GT platelets (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, c-Src in both wild-type control and GT platelets undergoes phosphorylation when the platelets are stimulated by thrombin, confirming that c-Src in GT platelets can be activated by a stimulus that is independent of αIIbβ3 (Fig. 2C). Studies using platelets from another well characterized patient with GT (19Basani R.B. Vilaire G. Shattil S.J. Kolodziej M.A. Bennett J.S. Poncz M. Glanzmann thrombasthenia due to a two amino acid deletion in the fourth calcium-binding domain of aIIb: demonstration of the importance of calcium-binding domains in the conformation of aIIbb3.Blood. 1996; 88: 167-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) produced identical results (data not shown). Nonetheless, it is still possible that the functional effects of anti-αIIb TM are due to its membrane solubility. To test this possibility, we studied the effects of an unrelated membrane-soluble peptide on platelet aggregation and secretion. The membrane-soluble peptide MS1 was designed using the two-stranded coiled-coil peptide GCN4-P1 as a template and is insoluble in water but readily solubilized in a variety of detergents (13Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Asparagine-mediated self-association of a model transmembrane helix.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and inserts into lipid bilayers (20Cristian L. Nanda V. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Synergistic interactions between aqueous and membrane domains of a designed protein determine its fold and stability.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2D, incubating platelets with 2 μm MS1 caused neither platelet aggregation nor ATP release. Thus, these experiments indicate that the ability of anti-αIIb TM to initiate platelet function requires the presence of αIIbβ3. To test this conclusion and to address whether anti-αIIb TM-induced αIIbβ3 activation requires c-Src kinase activity, we measured anti-αIIb TM-induced fibrinogen binding to platelet αIIbβ3 in the absence or presence of PP2. As shown by the flow cytometry histograms in Fig. 2E, 2 μm anti-αIIb TM caused FITC-fibrinogen binding to washed human platelets. The platelet-associated fibrinogen was bound to αIIbβ3 because binding was inhibited by the αIIbβ3 antagonist eptifibatide (21Bennett J.S. Novel platelet inhibitors.Annu Rev Med. 2001; 52: 161-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and prevented by the divalent cation chelator EDTA (10Yin H. Litvinov R.I. Vilaire G. Zhu H.

Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Computational design of peptides that target transmembrane helices.Science. 2007; 315: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). On the other hand, fibrinogen binding was only slightly decreased by the ADP-metabolizing enzyme apyrase, indicating that anti-αIIb TM-stimulated αIIbβ3 activation is not mediated by secreted platelet ADP (10Yin H. Litvinov R.I. Vilaire G. Zhu H. Li W. Caputo G.A. Moore D.T. Lear J.D. Weisel J.W. Degrado W.F. Bennett J.S.

Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Computational design of peptides that target transmembrane helices.Science. 2007; 315: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The small attenuation is likely due to the lack of signal amplification caused by secondary stimulation from secreted ADP. Furthermore, fibrinogen binding was unaffected by 10 μm PP2, indicating that it did not require c-Src kinase activity. Thus, these results indicate that anti-αIIb TM initiates platelet activation by binding and altering the conformation of αIIbβ3 and that this effect on αIIbβ3 is independent of platelet secretion and c-Src activity. Nonetheless, the attenuated platelet aggregation and lack of ATP secretion we observed in the presence of PP2 demonstrates that c-Src-stimulated platelet ADP secretion potentiates the platelet aggregation induced by the peptide. Platelet agonists like thrombin cause the rapid and transient activation of β3-bound c-Src (5Wu Y. Span L.M. Nygren P. Zhu H. Moore D.T. Cheng H. Roder H. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. The tyrosine kinase c-Src specifically binds to the active integrin αIIbβ3 to initiate outside-in signaling in platelets.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 15825-15834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To determine whether anti-αIIb TM has the same effect, we measured the anti-αIIb TM-stimulated interaction of c-Src with the β3 CT. Although we found no detectable c-Src associated with β3 in unstimulated platelets, c-Src binding to β3 was detected within 10 s after platelet exposure to anti-αIIb TM (Fig. 3). Similar to platelets stimulated by thrombin (5Wu Y. Span L.M. Nygren P. Zhu H. Moore D.T. Cheng H. Roder H. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. The tyrosine kinase c-Src specifically binds to the active integrin αIIbβ3 to initiate outside-in signaling in platelets.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 15825-15834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the amount of β3-bound c-Src increased progressively as the duration of exposure to anti-αIIb TM increased, reaching a maximum at 40 s, after which it declined. Phosphorylation of the β3-bound c-Src was first detected at 10 s. Like c-Src binding, it increased progressively, reaching a maximum at 40–60 s, after which it also declined (Fig. 3). Thus, like conventional platelet agonists, anti-αIIb TM causes rapid c-Src binding to β3 and its subsequent phosphorylation. c-Src represents 0.2–0.4% of total platelet protein (22Golden A. Brugge J.S. Thrombin treatment induces rapid changes in tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), but only 3% is associated with the β3 CT (3Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Src kinase activation by direct interaction with the integrin β cytoplasmic domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that the c-Src phosphorylation caused by anti-αIIb TM could be an off-target effect, unrelated to the ability of anti-αIIb TM to bind to αIIb, thereby releasing β3 to interact with cytoplasmic proteins (Fig. 1). To test this possibility, we compared anti-αIIb TM-induced c-Src phosphorylation in GT and WT control platelets. Although c-Src was readily detected in both the GT and WT platelets, we did not detect phosphorylated Tyr419 when the GT platelets were stimulated with either 10 μg/ml collagen or 2 μm anti-αIIb TM (Fig. 4A). Thus, these results indicate that anti-αIIb TM-induced phosphorylation of c-Src on Tyr419 occurs in an αIIbβ3-specific manner. However, it remains possible that c-Src activation is a nonspecific consequence of simply incubating platelets with a hydrophobic membrane-soluble peptide. To address this possibility, we incubated platelets with the membrane-soluble peptide MS1 as a negative control. However, as shown in Fig. 4B, incubating platelets with MS1 did not cause c-Src phosphorylation. Taken together, these results confirm that anti-αIIb TM-induced c-Src phosphorylation occurs when anti-αIIb TM interacts with αIIbβ3. Next, to address whether anti-αIIb TM-induced c-Src activation requires ligand binding to αIIbβ3, we incubated washed platelets suspended in buffer lacking fibrinogen and containing αIIbβ3 antagonists with 2 μm anti-αIIb TM for 1 min. c-Src was then immunoprecipitated from platelet lysates and immunoblotted for the phosphorylated c-Src residue Tyr419. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, anti-αIIb TM induced c-Src phosphorylation despite the presence of EDTA or eptifibatide, implying that it occurred in the absence of αIIbβ3-bound ligand. It also occurred when platelets were preincubated with the actin polymerization inhibitors cytochalasin D or latrunculin, indicating that c-Src phosphorylation was independent of platelet cytoskeletal rearrangement. On the other hand, anti-αIIb TM-induced c-Src phosphorylation was prevented by the c-Src kinase inhibitor PP2 but not by its inactive congener PP3 or by the Syk kinase inhibitor R406. Thus, these data indicate that anti-αIIb TM induces c-Src phosphorylation by a process that is independent of both extracellular ligand binding to αIIbβ3 and platelet cytoskeletal rearrangement but requires c-Src enzymatic activity and likely results from c-Src trans-autophosphorylation. The tyrosine kinase Syk is rapidly and transiently phosphorylated following platelet stimulation in a c-Src-dependent reaction (23Taniguchi T. Kitagawa H. Yasue S. Yanagi S. Sakai K. Asahi M. Ohta S. Takeuchi F. Nakamura S. Yamamura H. Protein-tyrosine kinase p72syk is activated by thrombin and is negatively regulated through Ca2+ mobilization in platelets.J. Biol.

Although Syk was initially reported to interact directly with the β3 CT of ligand-occupied αIIbβ3 (26Woodside D.G. Obergfell A. Leng L. Wilsbacher J.L. Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2334750982,"Fisheries observer programs are used around the world to collect crucial information and samples that inform fisheries management. However, observer error may misidentify similar-looking shark species. This raises questions about the level of error that species misidentifications could introduce to estimates of species’ life history parameters. This study addressed these questions using the Grey Reef Shark Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos as a case study. Observer misidentification rates were quantified by validating species identifications using diagnostic photographs taken on board supplemented with DNA barcoding. Length-at-age and maturity ogive analyses were then estimated and compared with and without the misidentified individuals. Vertebrae were retained from a total of 155 sharks identified by observers as C. amblyrhynchos. However, 22 (14%) of these were sharks were misidentified by the observers and were subsequently re-identified based on photographs and/or DNA barcoding. Of the 22 individuals misidentified as C. amblyrhynchos, 16 (73%) were detected using photographs and a further 6 via genetic validation. If misidentified individuals had been included, substantial error would have been introduced to both the length-at-age and the maturity estimates. Thus validating the species identification, increased the accuracy of estimated life history parameters for C. amblyrhynchos. From the corrected sample a multi-model inference approach was used to estimate growth for C. amblyrhynchos using three candidate models. The model averaged length-at-age parameters for C. amblyrhynchos with the sexes combined were = 159 cm TL and = 72 cm TL. Females mature at a greater length (l50 = 136 cm TL) and older age (A50 = 9.1 years) than males (l50 = 123 cm TL; A50 = 5.9 years). The inclusion of techniques to reduce misidentification in observer programs will improve the results of life history studies and ultimately improve management through the use of more accurate data for assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2316044482,"Background In the Arkhangelsk region of Northern Russia, multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) rates in new cases are amongst the highest in the world. In 2014, MDR-TB rates reached 31.7% among new cases and 56.9% among retreatment cases. The development of new diagnostic tools allows for faster detection of both TB and MDR-TB and should lead to reduced transmission by earlier initiation of anti-TB therapy. Study Aim The PROVE-IT (Policy Relevant Outcomes from Validating Evidence on Impact) Russia study aimed to assess the impact of the implementation of line probe assay (LPA) as part of an LPA-based diagnostic algorithm for patients with presumptive MDR-TB focusing on time to treatment initiation with time from first-care seeking visit to the initiation of MDR-TB treatment rather than diagnostic accuracy as the primary outcome, and to assess treatment outcomes. We hypothesized that the implementation of LPA would result in faster time to treatment initiation and better treatment outcomes. Methods A culture-based diagnostic algorithm used prior to LPA implementation was compared to an LPA-based algorithm that replaced BacTAlert and Löwenstein Jensen (LJ) for drug sensitivity testing. A total of 295 MDR-TB patients were included in the study, 163 diagnosed with the culture-based algorithm, 132 with the LPA-based algorithm. Results Among smear positive patients, the implementation of the LPA-based algorithm was associated with a median decrease in time to MDR-TB treatment initiation of 50 and 66 days compared to the culture-based algorithm (BacTAlert and LJ respectively, p<0.001). In smear negative patients, the LPA-based algorithm was associated with a median decrease in time to MDR-TB treatment initiation of 78 days when compared to the culture-based algorithm (LJ, p<0.001). However, several weeks were still needed for treatment initiation in LPA-based algorithm, 24 days in smear positive, and 62 days in smear negative patients. Overall treatment outcomes were better in LPA-based algorithm compared to culture-based algorithm (p = 0.003). Treatment success rates at 20 months of treatment were higher in patients diagnosed with the LPA-based algorithm (65.2%) as compared to those diagnosed with the culture-based algorithm (44.8%). Mortality was also lower in the LPA-based algorithm group (7.6%) compared to the culture-based algorithm group (15.9%). There was no statistically significant difference in smear and culture conversion rates between the two algorithms. Conclusion The results of the study suggest that the introduction of LPA leads to faster time to MDR diagnosis and earlier treatment initiation as well as better treatment outcomes for patients with MDR-TB. These findings also highlight the need for further improvements within the health system to reduce both patient and diagnostic delays to truly optimize the impact of new, rapid diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2331078976,"Several models of Gastric Emptying (GE) have been employed in the past to represent the rate of delivery of stomach contents to the duodenum and jejunum. These models have all used a deterministic form (algebraic equations or ordinary differential equations), considering GE as a continuous, smooth process in time. However, GE is known to occur as a sequence of spurts, irregular both in size and in timing. Hence, we formulate a simple stochastic process model, able to represent the irregular decrements of gastric contents after a meal. The model is calibrated on existing literature data and provides consistent predictions of the observed variability in the emptying trajectories. This approach may be useful in metabolic modeling, since it describes well and explains the apparently heterogeneous GE experimental results in situations where common gastric mechanics across subjects would be expected."
https://openalex.org/W2330295566,"Background Snakebites is a neglected disease and in Brazil is considered a serious health problem, with the majority of the snakebites caused by the genus Bothrops. Antivenom therapy and other first-aid treatments do not reverse local myonecrose which is the main sequel caused by the envenomation. Several studies have shown the effectiveness of low level laser (LLL) therapy in reducing local myonecrosis induced by Bothropic venoms, however the mechanism involved in this effect is unknown. In this in vitro study, we aimed to analyze the effect of LLL irradiation against cytotoxicity induced by Bothrops jararacussu venom on myoblast C2C12 cells. Methodology C2C12 were utilized as a model target and were incubated with B. jararacussu venom (12.5 μg/mL) and immediately irradiated with LLL at wavelength of red 685 nm or infrared 830 nm with energy density of 2.0, 4.6 and 7.0 J/cm2. Effects of LLL on cellular responses of venom-induced cytotoxicity were examined, including cell viability, measurement of cell damage and intra and extracellular ATP levels, expression of myogenic regulatory factors, as well as cellular differentiation. Results In non-irradiated cells, the venom caused a decrease in cell viability and a massive release of LDH and CK levels indicating myonecrosis. Infrared and red laser at all energy densities were able to considerably decrease venom-induced cytotoxicity. Laser irradiation induced myoblasts to differentiate into myotubes and this effect was accompanied by up regulation of MyoD and specially myogenin. Moreover, LLL was able to reduce the extracellular while increased the intracellular ATP content after venom exposure. In addition, no difference in the intensity of cytotoxicity was shown by non-irradiated and irradiated venom. Conclusion LLL irradiation caused a protective effect on C2C12 cells against the cytotoxicity caused by B. jararacussu venom and promotes differentiation of these cells by up regulation of myogenic factors. A modulatory effect of ATP synthesis may be suggested as a possible mechanism mediating cytoprotection observed under laser irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2319364552,"Examples of dynamic polymerase exchange have been previously characterized in model systems provided by coliphages T4 and T7. Using a dominant negative D403E polymerase (Pol) III α that can form initiation complexes and sequester primer termini but not elongate, we investigated the possibility of exchange at the Escherichia coli replication fork on a rolling circle template. Unlike other systems, addition of polymerase alone did not lead to exchange. Only when D403E Pol III was bound to a τ-containing DnaX complex did exchange occur. In contrast, addition of Pol IV led to rapid exchange in the absence of bound DnaX complex. Examination of Pol III* with varying composition of τ or the alternative shorter dnaX translation product γ showed that τ-, τ2-, or τ3-DnaX complexes supported equivalent levels of synthesis, identical Okazaki fragment size, and gaps between fragments, possessed the ability to challenge pre-established replication forks, and displayed equivalent susceptibility to challenge by exogenous D403E Pol III*. These findings reveal that redundant interactions at the replication fork must stabilize complexes containing only one τ. Previously, it was thought that at least two τs in the trimeric DnaX complex were required to couple the leading and lagging strand polymerases at the replication fork. Possible mechanisms of exchange are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2321901038,"Studies of marine viromes (viral metagenomes) have revealed that DNA viruses are highly diverse and exhibit biogeographic patterns. However, little is known about the diversity of RNA viruses, which are mostly composed of eukaryotic viruses, and their biogeographic patterns in the oceans. A growth in global commerce and maritime traffic may accelerate spread of diverse and non-cosmopolitan DNA viruses and potentially RNA viruses from one part of the world to another. Here, we demonstrated through metagenomic analyses that failure to comply with mid-ocean ballast water exchange regulation could result in movement of viromes including both DNA viruses and RNA viruses (including potential viral pathogens) unique to geographic and environmental niches. Furthermore, our results showed that virus richness (known and unknown viruses) in ballast water is associated with distance between ballast water exchange location and its nearest shoreline as well as length of water storage time in ballast tanks (voyage duration). However, richness of only known viruses is governed by local environmental conditions and different viral groups have different responses to environmental variation. Overall, these results identified ballast water as a factor contributing to ocean virome transport and potentially increased exposure of the aquatic bioshpere to viral invasion."

Characterizations of the CuS-GeO2-TiO2 composite coating were taken by SEM (scanning electron microscope), XRD (X-ray diffraction), EDX (energy dispersive X-ray), UV-Vis DRS (ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectrum), and FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy). Results showed that CuS and GeO2 had dispersed in this CuS-GeO2-TiO2 composite coating (mass percentages for CuS and GeO2 were 1.23% and 2.79%, respectively). The electrochemical studies (cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization) of this CuS-GeO2-TiO2 composite coating electrode were performed in pH = 9.51 Na2CO3-NaHCO3 buffer solution containing 0.50 mol/L CH3OH under the conditions of visible light, ultraviolet light (λ = 365 nm), and dark (without light irradiation as control), respectively. Electrochemical studies indicated that this CuS-GeO2-TiO2 composite coating electrode had better photoelectrocatalytic activity than the pure TiO2 electrode in the electrocatalysis of methanol under visible light."
https://openalex.org/W2321615319,"Both schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neuropsychiatric disorders with overlapping genetic etiology. Protocadherin 15 (PCDH15), which encodes a member of the cadherin super family that contributes to neural development and function, has been cited as a risk gene for neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, rare variants of large effect have been paid attention to understand the etiopathology of these complex disorders. Thus, we evaluated the impacts of rare, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in PCDH15 on SCZ or ASD. First, we conducted coding exon-targeted resequencing of PCDH15 with next-generation sequencing technology in 562 Japanese patients (370 SCZ and 192 ASD) and detected 16 heterozygous SNVs. We then performed association analyses on 2,096 cases (1,714 SCZ and 382 ASD) and 1,917 controls with six novel variants of these 16 SNVs. Of these six variants, four (p.R219K, p.T281A, p.D642N, c.3010-1G>C) were ultra-rare variants (minor allele frequency < 0.0005) that may increase disease susceptibility. Finally, no statistically significant association between any of these rare, heterozygous PCDH15 point variants and SCZ or ASD was found. Our results suggest that a larger sample size of resequencing subjects is necessary to detect associations between rare PCDH15 variants and neuropsychiatric disorders."

Protein levels of EGFR, cMET and their phosphorylated proteins were measured in 825 BC samples using reverse phase protein array (RPPA). Given unimodal distribution of proteins, the median was selected as a cut-off after sensitivity analyses. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Cox-proportional hazards models were utilized to determine associations between EGFR and cMET with outcomes. Mean age was 58 years with 457 (55%) hormone receptor (HR) positive, 211 (26%) triple-negative (TN) and 148 (18%) HER2 positive tumors (HER2+). HER2+ was associated with higher EGFR expression and phosphorylation, compared to HR and TN (p<0.05). High EGFR expression was associated with higher phosphorylated-cMET (p-cMET) but not cMET (ANOVA p-cMET p < 0.001; cMET p = 0.34). The same association was found with high phosphorylated-EGFR (p-EGFR) group at Tyr992 and Tyr1068 (both p < 0.001). High expressions in either of two p-EGFRs were linked with higher cMET as well (all p<0.001). For the TN subtype, high expression in EGFR and p-EGFR at Tyr992 but not at Tyr1068 was associated with higher p-cMET (p<0.00, p = 0.012, p = 0.4 respectively). Only high expression in p-EGFR at Tyr992 was linked with higher expression of cMET (p = 0.02). In contrast, among HER2 subtype, high expression in p-EGFR at Tyr1068 but not at Tyr992 was associated with higher cMET and p-cMET (cMET p = 0.023;p-cMET p<0.001). Four subgroups of patients defined by dichotomized EGFR/p-EGFR and cMET/p-cMET level demonstrated no significant differences in survival. In multivariate analyses, neither cMET nor EGFR expression/activation was found to be an independent prognostic factor in survival outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2322192983,"The maintenance of potassium homeostasis is crucial for all types of cells, including Candida glabrata. Three types of plasma-membrane systems mediating potassium influx with different transport mechanisms have been described in yeasts: the Trk1 uniporter, the Hak cation-proton symporter and the Acu ATPase. The C. glabrata genome contains only one gene encoding putative system for potassium uptake, the Trk1 uniporter. Therefore, its importance in maintaining adequate levels of intracellular potassium appears to be critical for C. glabrata cells. In this study, we first confirmed the potassium-uptake activity of the identified gene's product by heterologous expression in a suitable S. cerevisiae mutant, further we generated a corresponding deletion mutant in C. glabrata and analysed its phenotype in detail. The obtained results show a pleiotropic effect on the cell physiology when CgTRK1 is deleted, affecting not only the ability of trk1Δ to grow at low potassium concentrations, but also the tolerance to toxic alkali-metal cations and cationic drugs, as well as the membrane potential and intracellular pH. Taken together, our results find the sole potassium uptake system in C. glabrata cells to be a promising target in the search for its specific inhibitors and in developing new antifungal drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2327172091,"Yoga alters spontaneous respiratory regulation and reduces hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses. Since a lower ventilatory response is associated with an improved endurance capacity during whole-body exercise, we tested whether yogic subjects (YOGA) show an increased endurance capacity compared to matched non-yogic individuals (CON) with similar physical activity levels. Resting ventilation, the ventilatory response to hypercapnia, passive leg movement and exercise, as well as endurance performance were assessed. YOGA (n = 9), compared to CONTROL (n = 6), had a higher tidal volume at rest (0.7±0.2 vs. 0.5±0.1 l, p = 0.034) and a reduced ventilatory response to hypercapnia (33±15 vs. 47±15 l·min-1, p = 0.048). A YOGA subgroup (n = 6) with maximal performance similar to CONTROL showed a blunted ventilatory response to passive cycling (11±2 vs. 14±2 l·min-1, p = 0.039) and a tendency towards lower exercise ventilation (33±2 vs. 36±3 l·min-1, p = 0.094) while cycling endurance (YOGA: 17.3±3.3; CON: 19.6±8.5 min, p = 0.276) did not differ. Thus, yoga practice was not associated with improved exercise capacity nor with significant changes in exercise ventilation despite a significantly different respiratory regulation at rest and in response to hypercapnia and passive leg movement."
https://openalex.org/W2313734533,"The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) gene family is considered to be one of the largest gene families in all forms of prokaryotic and eukaryotic life. Although the ABC transporter genes have been annotated in some species, detailed information about the ABC superfamily and the evolutionary characterization of ABC genes in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) are still unclear. In this research, we identified 61 ABC transporter genes in the common carp genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that they could be classified into seven subfamilies, namely 11 ABCAs, six ABCBs, 19 ABCCs, eight ABCDs, two ABCEs, four ABCFs, and 11 ABCGs. Comparative analysis of the ABC genes in seven vertebrate species including common carp, showed that at least 10 common carp genes were retained from the third round of whole genome duplication, while 12 duplicated ABC genes may have come from the fourth round of whole genome duplication. Gene losses were also observed for 14 ABC genes. Expression profiles of the 61 ABC genes in six common carp tissues (brain, heart, spleen, kidney, intestine, and gill) revealed extensive functional divergence among the ABC genes. Different copies of some genes had tissue-specific expression patterns, which may indicate some gene function specialization. This study provides essential genomic resources for future studies in common carp."

In this study, a sequenced MabrNPV strain, MabrNPV-CTa, was used to perform proteomic analysis of both BVs and ODVs derived from two infected hosts: Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera exigua. A total of 82 and 39 viral proteins were identified in ODVs and BVs, respectively. And totally, 23 and 76 host proteins were identified as virion-associated with ODVs and BVs, respectively. The host proteins incorporated into the virus particles were mainly involved in cytoskeleton, signaling, vesicle trafficking, chaperone and metabolic systems. Some host proteins, such as actin, cyclophilin A and heat shock protein 70 would be important for viral replication. Several host proteins involved in immune response were also identified in BV, and a C-type lectin protein was firstly found to be associated with BV and its family members have been demonstrated to be involved in entry process of other viruses. This study facilitated the annotation of baculovirus genome, and would help us to understand baculovirus virion structure. Furthermore, the identification of host proteins associated with virions produced in vivo would facilitate investigations on the involvement of intriguing host proteins in virus replication."

This article shows how the capability to predict photosynthetic processes can benefit from a synergy between mathematical modelling and lab-scale experiments using systematic design of experiment techniques. A model of chlorophyll fluorescence developed by the authors [Nikolaou et al., J Biotechnol 194:91–99, 2015] is used as starting point, whereby the representation of non-photochemical-quenching (NPQ) process is refined for biological consistency. This model spans multiple time scales ranging from milliseconds to hours, thus calling for a combination of various experimental techniques in order to arrive at a sufficiently rich data set and determine statistically meaningful estimates for the model parameters. The methodology is demonstrated for the microalga Nannochloropsis gaditana by combining pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorescence, photosynthesis rate and antenna size measurements. The results show that the calibrated model is capable of accurate quantitative predictions under a wide range of transient light conditions. Moreover, this work provides an experimental validation of the link between fluorescence and photosynthesis-irradiance (PI) curves which had been theoricized."

We assessed CSC effects on hippocampal glucocorticoid (GC) receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and FK506 binding protein (FKBP51) expression, acute heterotypic stressor-induced GR translocation, as well as GC effects on gene expression and cell viability in isolated hippocampal cells. CSC mice showed decreased GR mRNA and cytoplasmic protein levels compared with single-housed control (SHC) mice. Basal and acute stress-induced nuclear GR protein expression were comparable between CSC and SHC mice, as were MR and FKBP51 mRNA and/or cytoplasmic protein levels. In vitro the effect of corticosterone (CORT) on hippocampal cell viability and gene transcription was more pronounced in CSC versus SHC mice. In summary, CSC mice show an, if at all, increased hippocampal GC signaling capacity despite lower cytoplasmic GR protein expression, making negative feedback deficits in the hippocampus unlikely to contribute to the increased ACTH drive following CSC."

Gastric pepsin within reflux contributes to immunologic reactions in the tonsil. In this study, we aimed to find the relationships between pepsin and tonsillar hypertrophy.We explored the notion whether tonsillar hypertrophy was due to pepsin-mediated gastric reflux in tonsil hypertrophy. Fifty-four children with tonsil hypertrophy and 30 adults with tonsillitis were recruited before surgical treatment. Blood and tonsil tissues from each patient were harvested for analysis of changes in lymphocyte and macrophage numbers coupled with histological and biochemical analysis. Pepsin was expressed at different levels in tonsil tissues from each tonsillar hypertrophy. Pepsin-positive cells were found in the crypt epithelium, surrounding the lymphoid follicle with developing fibrosis, and also surrounding the lymphoid follicle that faced the crypt. And also, pepsin staining was well correlated with damaged tonsillar squamous epithelium and TGF-β1 and iNOS expression in the tonsil section. In addition, pepsin and TGF-β1-positive cells were co-localized with CD68-positive cells in the crypt and surrounding germinal centers. In comparison of macrophage responsiveness to pepsin, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were noticeably larger in the presence of activated pepsin in the child group. Furthermore, CD11c and CD163-positive cells were significantly increased by activated pepsin. However, this was not seen for the culture of PBMNCs from the adult group.The lymphocytes and monocytes are in a highly proliferative state in the tonsillar hypertrophy and associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory factors as a result of exposure to stomach reflux pepsin."
https://openalex.org/W2325089904,"The neuroendocrine effects of leptin on metabolism hold promise to be translated into a complementary therapy to traditional insulin therapy for diabetes and obesity. However, injections of leptin can provoke inflammation. We tested the effects of leptin, produced in the physiological adipocyte location, on metabolism in mouse models of genetic and dietary obesity. We generated 3T3-L1 adipocytes constitutively secreting leptin and encapsulated them in a poly-L-lysine membrane, which protects the cells from immune rejection. Ob/ob mice (OB) were injected with capsules containing no cells (empty, OB[Emp]), adipocytes (OB[3T3]), or adipocytes overexpressing leptin (OB[Lep]) into both visceral fat depots. Leptin was found in the plasma of OB[Lep], but not OB[Emp] and OB[3T3] mice at the end of treatment (72 days). The OB[Lep] and OB[3T3] mice have transiently suppressed appetite and weight loss compared to OB[Emp]. Only OB[Lep] mice have greater brown fat mass, metabolic rate, and reduced resistin plasma levels compared to OB[Emp]. Glucose tolerance was markedly better in OB[Lep] vs. OB[Emp] and OB[3T3] mice as well as in wild type mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance treated with encapsulated leptin-producing adipocytes. Our proof-of-principle study provides evidence of long-term improvement of glucose tolerance with encapsulated adipocytes producing leptin."
https://openalex.org/W2326332602,"Background Social anxiety is thought to be strongly related to maladaptive emotion regulation (ER). As social anxiety symptoms accumulate in families, we hypothesize that maladaptive ER is also more prevalent in families with anxious children. Thus, we analyze differences in emotion regulation of both child and mother in relation to social anxiety, as well as both their ER strategies in dealing with anxiety. Further, a positive relation between child and maternal ER strategies is assumed. Method Children (aged 9 to 13 years) with social, anxiety disorder (SAD; n = 25) and healthy controls (HC, n = 26) as well as their mothers completed several measures of social anxiety and trait ER strategies towards anxiety. As ER of children is still in development, age is considered as covariate. Results SAD children and their mothers reported more maladaptive ER strategies than HC dyads. Maternal maladaptive ER was related negatively to child adaptive ER which was further moderated by the child’s age. Discussion Maladaptive ER strategies seem to contribute to the exacerbation of social anxiety in both mother and child. Mothers reporting maladaptive ER may have difficulties supporting their child in coping with social anxiety while simultaneously also experiencing heightened levels of anxiety. Deeper understanding of interactional processes between mothers and children during development can assist the comprehension of factors maintaining SAD. Implications for future research and possible consequences for interventions are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2315458901,"Learning appears to be ubiquitous among animals, as it plays a key role in many behaviors including foraging and reproduction. Although there is some genetic basis for differences in learning ability and memory retention, environment also plays an important role, as it does for any other trait. For example, adult animals maintained in enriched housing conditions learn faster and remember tasks for longer than animals maintained in impoverished conditions. Such plasticity in adult learning ability has often been linked to plasticity in the brain, and studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms, stimuli, and consequences of adult behavioral and brain plasticity are numerous. However, the role of experiences during post-embryonic development in shaping plasticity in adult learning ability and memory retention remain relatively unexplored. Using the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) as a model organism, we developed a protocol to allow the odor preference of a large number of crickets to be tested in a short period of time. We then used this new protocol to examine how enrichment or impoverishment at two developmental stages (either the last nymphal instar or young adult) affected adult memory. Our results show that regardless of nymphal rearing conditions, crickets that experienced an enriched rearing condition as young adults performed better on a memory task than individuals that experienced an impoverished condition. Older adult crickets (more than 1 week post adult molt) did not demonstrate differences in memory of the odor task, regardless of rearing condition as a young adult. Our results suggest that environmentally-induced plasticity in memory may be restricted to the young adult stage."
https://openalex.org/W2320889708,"Metazoan development demands not only precise cell fate differentiation but also accurate timing of cell division to ensure proper development. How cell divisions are temporally coordinated during development is poorly understood. Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis provides an excellent opportunity to study this coordination due to its invariant development and widespread division asynchronies. One of the most pronounced asynchronies is a significant delay of cell division in two endoderm progenitor cells, Ea and Ep, hereafter referred to as E2, relative to its cousins that mainly develop into mesoderm organs and tissues. To unravel the genetic control over the endoderm-specific E2 division timing, a total of 822 essential and conserved genes were knocked down using RNAi followed by quantification of cell cycle lengths using in toto imaging of C. elegans embryogenesis and automated lineage. Intriguingly, knockdown of numerous genes encoding the components of general transcription pathway or its regulatory factors leads to a significant reduction in the E2 cell cycle length but an increase in cell cycle length of the remaining cells, indicating a differential requirement of transcription for division timing between the two. Analysis of lineage-specific RNA-seq data demonstrates an earlier onset of transcription in endoderm than in other germ layers, the timing of which coincides with the birth of E2, supporting the notion that the endoderm-specific delay in E2 division timing demands robust zygotic transcription. The reduction in E2 cell cycle length is frequently associated with cell migration defect and gastrulation failure. The results suggest that a tissue-specific transcriptional activation is required to coordinate fate differentiation, division timing, and cell migration to ensure proper development."

Whether histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can relieve benzene-induced hematotoxicity remains unclear. Here we showed that hydroquinone, a main metabolite of benzene, increased the HDAC activity, decreased the Topo IIα expression and induced apoptosis in human bone marrow mononuclear cells in vitro, and treatment with two HDAC inhibitors, namely trichostatin A (TSA) or a mixture of ribosome-inactivating proteins MCP30, almost completely reversed these effects. We further established a benzene poisoning murine model by inhaling benzene vapor in a container and found that benzene poisoning decreased the expression and activity of Topo IIα, and impaired acetylation of histone H4 and H3. The analysis of regulatory factors of Topo IIα promoter found that benzene poisoning decreased the mRNA levels of SP1 and C-MYB, and increased the mRNA level of SP3. Both TSA and MCP30 significantly enhanced the acetylation of histone H3 and H4 in Topo IIα promoter and increased the expression and activity of Topo IIα in benzene poisoning mice, which contributed to relieve the symptoms of hematotoxicity. Thus, treatment with HDAC inhibitors represents an attractive approach to reduce benzene-induced hematotoxicity."

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism responsible for brain targeting of different prion strains is unknown. It is possible that neural connectivity, expression of strain-specific cofactors/receptors or differences in biological clearance by certain cell types might be responsible for the specific signature of accumulation each agent generates in affected brains. Although prion strains have been identified in almost all naturally or experimentally susceptible animal species, the ones observed in Syrian hamsters are especially intriguing due to the wide variety of clinical signs they can generate (19Bessen R.A.

Virol. 1987; 68: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this work, we dissected and isolated different brain areas of Syrian hamsters independently infected with four prion strains, and the relative accumulation of disease-associated PrP present in each structure was measured. In addition, protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reactions using PrPC substrate from different brain regions were used to assess substrate specific replication of the agent in a cell-free environment. Our results show that strain-specific brain distribution of PrPSc in infected animals was not reproduced by in vitro prion replication. Actually, the efficiency of in vitro prion replication depended mostly on the amount of PrPC substrate available. These results suggest that the brain tropism of each prion strain is determined by factors or cellular processes not present in a simplified in vitro replication reaction. ∼30-day-old female Syrian golden hamsters received intra-hippocampal injections (5–10 μl) of brain homogenates from clinically ill HY (hyper-TME), DY (drowsy-TME) (19Bessen R.A.

Animals were periodically observed for the appearance of clinical signs according to the following scales: HY: 1) normal animal; 2) mild behavioral abnormalities including hyperactivity and hypersensitivity to noise; 3) moderate behavioral problems including head tremors, ataxia, wobbling gait, head bobbing, irritability, and aggressiveness; 4) severe behavioral abnormalities including all of the above plus head and body jerks and spontaneous backrolls; and 5) terminal stage of the disease in which the animal lies in the cage and is no longer able to stand up. DY: 1) normal animal; 2) mild behavioral abnormalities including mild lethargy; 3) increased lethargy and curl up sleep posture; 4) same as 3 but decrease in body weight and difficulty to open the eyes; and 5) terminal stage of the disease in which the animal lies in the cage and is no longer able to stand up. 139H: 1) normal animal; 2) mild behavioral abnormalities including minor signs of ataxia; 3) increased food uptake and body weight; 4) same as 3 but slight reduction in body weight and increased ataxia; and 5) terminal stage of the disease in which the animal lies in the cage and is no longer able to stand up. SSLOW: 1) normal animal; 2) mild behavioral abnormalities including slight sensitivity to noise and touch; 3) same as 2 but increase in body weight and apparent skin dryness; 4) progressive increase in body weight, dry skin (sometimes including matted hair, especially in the thoracic area), and mild lethargy; and 5) terminal stage of the disease in which the animal reduces its body weight, lies in the cage and is no longer able to stand up. Animals scoring stage 4 for more than 1 week in HY, DY, and 139H, and longer than 3 weeks in SSLOW, were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation. Injected brain hemispheres were snap frozen and kept at −80 °;C. Contra-lateral hemispheres were fixed and used for neuropathological assessments. All manipulations involving living subjects were performed following NIH and institutional guidelines for animal research. Brains from animals sacrificed at stage 4 of clinical signs were fixed in Carnoy, dehydrated and embedded in paraplast. 10-μm brain slices were stained with hematoxilin-eosin. Vacuolation scores were assigned as previously described (8Fraser H. Dickinson A.G. The sequential development of the brain lesion of scrapie in three strains of mice.J. Comp. Pathol. 1968; 78: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Frozen brains from prion infected or uninfected animals (n = 3–5) were placed in ice-cold Petri dishes and quickly dissected using a surgical blade. Dissection resulted in the following isolated structures: olfactory bulb (OB), frontal cortex (FC), parietal cortex (PC), occipital cortex (OC), caudate/putamen (CPu), hippocampus (Hipp), thalamus (Thal), hypothalamus (Hypo), midbrain (Mb), cerebellum (Cb), and medulla/pons (MP). Resulting tissues were immediately homogenized at 10% w/v in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Homogenates were spun down at 805 × g for 45 s at 4 °;C to remove debris. Supernatants were collected and total protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay following manufacturer’s recommendations (Pierce, Waltham, MA). Samples were diluted in homogenization buffer to match the concentration of homogenates containing the lowest amount of protein in each brain. Aliquots containing the same amount of total protein by BCA were proteinase K (PK, Sigma) treated (50 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °;C with shaking) and PrP27–30 (the protease-resistant fragment of PrPSc) content assessed by Western blotting (WB). WB procedure was performed as previously described, using the 6D11 anti-PrP antibody (Covance, Princeton, NJ) (22Morales R. Duran-Aniotz C. Diaz-Espinoza R. Camacho M.V. Soto C. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification of infectious prions.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 1397-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Levels of PrPC in brain regions from healthy animals were measured as above but without PK treatment. Densitometric signals obtained in each independent membrane were quantified using the Quantify One (4.6.7) software (Bio-Rad). Values obtained for each isolated brain structure were expressed as a percentage of the added signals obtained for all structures within the same brain. Brains from five animals per strain were measured at least three independent times to assess reproducibility. Results were averaged and plotted using the Prism GraphPad software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). To additionally control total protein load, all samples were independently probed against the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) using the GAPDH-71.1 antibody (Sigma). GAPDH signals were assessed in separated blots loaded with the same volume of material without PK treatment. PMCA was performed as previously reported (22Morales R. Duran-Aniotz C. Diaz-Espinoza R. Camacho M.V. Soto C. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification of infectious prions.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 1397-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with minimum changes (source of substrate for the reaction). Briefly, ∼30-day-old hamsters were sacrificed and perfused as described (22Morales R. Duran-Aniotz C. Diaz-Espinoza R. Camacho M.V. Soto C. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification of infectious prions.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 1397-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Some brains were dissected in the following structures before substrate preparation: cortex (Ctx), caudate/putamen (CPu), hippocampus (Hipp), thalamus/hypothalamus (Thal+Hypo), midbrain (Mb), cerebellum (Cb), and medulla/pons (MP). Levels of in vitro replication for each strain were measured in a single PMCA round using 2-fold serial PrPSc-containing brain homogenate dilutions and whole brain extracts as substrate. For brain region-specific in vitro replication, 5-fold serial dilutions of whole brain extract containing HY, DY, 139H, and SSLOW prions were made on PMCA substrates prepared from isolated brain structures and submitted to a single PMCA round. 5-fold dilutions were chosen for this experiment to cover a wider range of PrPSc dilutions and thus increase chances to detect region specific differences for replication-efficient strains. PMCA efficiency was assessed by comparing to aliquots of the same reaction not submitted to incubation/sonication cycles (non-amplified). Because of the dissimilar behavior of prion strains in PMCA, data were analyzed as a percentage of the maximum folds of amplification obtained for each PrPSc strain. For the calculation of amplification folds, we estimated the last dilution in which PrP27–30 signal was detectable by WB (signal >10% of the background) divided by the last dilution observed without amplification. Percentages were calculated using the log5 PMCA amplification folds for each reaction since tested samples were serially diluted using a 5-fold dilution factor. Correlations between “% of log5 (PMCA amplification folds)” and “% of PrPC” were made using the averaged data obtained from these two data sets. Data obtained from three different sources of infected brains per prion strain were averaged and plotted. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated using the Prism GraphPad software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). For our experiments, we used four clinically and pathologically different hamster prion strains: HY, DY, 139H, and SSLOW. The specific characteristics of these prion variants have been extensively described elsewhere (5Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F.

Virol. 2000; 74: 5542-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1A, the prion strains used for this study showed different incubation periods, being HY the most aggressive (76.6 ± 3.8, average days post injection ± standard error) and SSLOW the one producing disease at longer times (423.5 ± 11.8). Although DY and 139H prions showed similar incubation periods (210.3 ± 9.6 and 203.4 ± 6.6, respectively) they were easily differentiated by their clinical signs (detailed description under “Experimental Procedures”). Histopathological analyses by measuring the degree of spongiform degeneration in three areas of the brain confirmed the different pathology expected for these strains (Fig. 1B). An additional method to differentiate prion strains utilizes their electrophoretic profile after PK digestion. In these analyses, the mobility of the unglycosylated band as well as the preference for specific glycoforms are measured (3Morales R. Abid K. Soto C. The prion strain phenomenon: molecular basis and unprecedented features.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We observed that all these strains have preference for the diglycosylated form of PrP as commonly observed for hamster prions (Fig. 1C). However, only DY prions showed a faster electrophoretic mobility (∼19 kDa) compared with all other strains (∼21 kDa). The results depicted in this figure confirm the differential identity of the prion material used in our experiments. Brains of symptomatic animals infected with the four prion strains previously described were dissected out, and content of PrP27–30 was analyzed by WB. As expected, we found different profiles of PrP27–30 accumulation among the different prion strains analyzed (Fig. 2). The distribution of PrP27–30 among the structures examined showed that HY prions distribute similarly in all brain regions with the sole exception of the thalamus and hypothalamus were accumulation of disease associated prion protein was highest (Fig. 2A). This observation is in agreement with a previous report showing a strong presence of diffuse aggregates for this strain in the medial geniculate nucleus (25Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. Distinct PrP properties suggest the molecular basis of strain variation in transmissible mink encephalopathy.J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, DY prions, a strain sharing the same origin with HY prions, showed a considerably distinct pattern of deposition (Fig. 2B). This strain presented a higher burden of prion accumulation along the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. On the contrary, the olfactory bulb presented the lowest relative signal among all strains studied. 139H, a hamster adapted mouse prion strain (7DeArmond S.J. Sánchez H. Yehiely F. Qiu Y.

The preference of 139H prions for cortical areas is in agreement with previous reports (16Hecker R. Taraboulos A. Scott M. Pan K.M. Yang S.L. Torchia M. Jendroska K. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Replication of distinct scrapie prion isolates is region specific in brains of transgenic mice and hamsters.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1213-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). 139H’s pattern of prion accumulation differed from DY and HY mostly in the strong signals found in olfactory bulb and lower contribution of thalamus and hypothalamus, respectively. The lowest levels of PrP27–30 for this strain were found in the cerebellum and medulla/pons (Fig. 2C). SSLOW prions have been previously shown to generate large thioflavin S positive deposits in the brain of affected animals, especially in the hippocampus (23Jeffrey M. McGovern G. Makarava N. González L. Kim Y.S. Rohwer R.G. Baskakov I.V. Pathology of SSLOW, a transmissible and fatal synthetic prion protein disorder, and comparison with naturally occurring classical transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2014; 40: 296-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our results confirmed the important contribution of hippocampus in PrP accumulation for this strain (Fig. 2D). We also observed a strong presence of SSLOW-PrP aggregates in the occipital cortex. The lowest levels of PrP27–30 for this strain were found in the caudate/putamen and cerebellum. To study whether the different profiles of brain PrP27–30 accumulation observed in the four strains analyzed was due to differential replication of prions in distinct brain areas, we performed experiments of in vitro prion replication using PMCA. We have previously shown that PMCA faithfully reproduces the generation and propagation of different prion strains in vitro (12Castilla J. Morales R. Saá P. Barria M. Gambetti P. Soto C. Cell-free propagation of prion strains.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These results, which have been corroborated for prions from different species (26Green K.M. Castilla J. Seward T.S. Napier D.L. Jewell J.E. Soto C. Telling G.C.

To analyze whether differences in strain-specific accumulation of PrPSc in vivo is due to differential replication of prion strains in distinct brain regions, brains from healthy animals designated for PMCA substrate were carefully dissected and different brain structures independently homogenized. The level of PrPC expression in each of these regions was determined by WB (Fig. 3A) followed by densitometric analysis (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2324089647,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the most potent stimulants of food intake in many animals. Most of the supporting evidence for the effects of NPY has been gathered in mammalian species using porcine NPY. To investigate the effects of NPY on precocial feeding initiation in chicks, we firstly used chicken NPY (cNPY) to study its role in food intake and spontaneous activities in 3-day-old male chicks. Food intake was monitored at different times after intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of cNPY (2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 μg/10 μL) and anti-cNPY antibody (anti-cNPY) (1:9000, 1:3000 or 1:1000 in dilution). cNPY given at different doses significantly increased food intake at 30 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min after injection. Chicks treated with 5.0 μg/10 μL of cNPY showed a maximal 4.48 fold increase in food intake comparing to the control at 30 min. There is still more than 2 fold increase in food intake at 120 min after injection of cNPY. Food intake was significantly inhibited by a single ICV injection of anti-cNPY diluted to 1:9000 (60% inhibition), 1:3000 (92% inhibition), and 1:1000 (95% inhibition) at 30 min with 1:1000 being the maximally effective concentration. The inhibitory effects of anti-cNPY (diluted to1:9000, 1:3000, 1:1000) at 120 min post ICV injection were 22%, 42% and 46%, respectively. But ICV of anti-cNPY (1:3000 in dilution) did not block the orexigenic effect of 2.5 μg/10 μL of cNPY. ICV injection of different concentrations of cNPY increases locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner while ICV anti-cNPY greatly decreased the distance moved by each chick compared to control groups. Taken together, our results demonstrated that cNPY has a promoting effect on chick food intake and locomotor activity, and that endogenous cNPY might play a positive role in regulating precocial feeding behavior in newly hatched chicks."

Both whey protein isolates (WPIs) and vitamin E tocotrienols (TCTs) exert favorable effects on obesity-related metabolic parameters. This research sought to determine whether these supplements improved exercise capacity and increased glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese rats.Six week old male rats (n = 35) weighing 187 ± 32g were allocated to either: Control (n = 9), TCT (n = 9), WPI (n = 8) or TCT + WPI (n = 9) and placed on a high-fat diet (40% of energy from fat) for 10 weeks. Animals received 50mg/kg body weight and 8% of total energy intake per day of TCTs and/or WPIs respectively. Food intake, body composition, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, exercise capacity, skeletal muscle glycogen content and oxidative enzyme activity were determined.Both TCT and WPI groups ran >50% longer (2271 ± 185m and 2195 ± 265m respectively) than the Control group (1428 ± 139m) during the run to exhaustion test (P<0.05), TCT + WPI did not further improve exercise endurance (2068 ± 104m). WPIs increased the maximum in vitro activity of beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA in the soleus muscle (P<0.05 vs. Control) but not in the plantaris. Citrate synthase activity was not different between groups. Neither supplement had any effect on weight gain, adiposity, glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity.Ten weeks of both TCTs and WPIs increased exercise endurance by 50% in sedentary, diet-induced obese rats. These positive effects of TCTs and WPIs were independent of body weight, adiposity or glucose tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2315073101,"The yeast Ipi3p is required for DNA replication and cell viability in Sacharomyces cerevisiae. It is an essential component of the Rix1 complex (Rix1p/Ipi2p-Ipi1p-Ipi3p) that is required for the processing of 35S pre-rRNA in pre-60S ribosomal particles and for the initiation of DNA replication. The human IPI3 homolog is WDR18 (WD repeat domain 18), which shares significant homology with yIpi3p. Here we report that knockdown of hIPI3 resulted in substantial defects in the chromatin association of the MCM complex, DNA replication, cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. Importantly, hIPI3 silencing did not result in a reduction of the protein level of hCDC6, hMCM7, or the ectopically expressed GFP protein, indicating that protein synthesis was not defective in the same time frame of the DNA replication and cell cycle defects. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein levels of hIPI3 fluctuate in the cell cycle, with the highest levels from M phase to early G1 phase, similar to other pre-replicative (pre-RC) proteins. Moreover, hIPI3 interacts with other replication-initiation proteins, co-localizes with hMCM7 in the nucleus, and is important for the nuclear localization of hMCM7. We also found that hIPI3 preferentially binds to the origins of DNA replication including those at the c-Myc, Lamin-B2 and β-Globin loci. These results indicate that hIPI3 is involved in human DNA replication licensing independent of its role in ribosome biogenesis."

A total of 3046 eligible children (1527 in the RDT arm and 1519 in the CJ- arm) living around 32 health centres were enrolled. Nearly half were female (48.7%) and 47.8% were below the age of 12 months as at enrolment. Over 24-months, the incidence of all episodes of malaria following the first febrile illness was 0.64 (95% CI 0.49–0.82) and 0.76 (0.63–0.93) per child per year in the RDT and CJ arms respectively (adjusted rate ratio 1.13 (0.82–1.55). After the first episode of febrile illness, the incidence of severe anaemia was the same in both arms (0.11 per child per year) and that of moderate anaemia was 0.16 (0.13–0.21) vs. 0.17 (0.14–0.21) per child year respectively. The incidence of severe febrile illness was 0.15 (0.09, 0.24) in the RDT arm compared to 0.17 (0.11, 0.28) per child per year respectively. The proportion of fever cases receiving ACT was lower in the RDT arm (72% vs 81%; p = 0.02). Conclusion The test-based approach to the management of malaria did not increase the incidence of malaria or anaemia among under-five children in this setting.

TF-chromatin interactions are highly dynamic, which are evaluated by recovery half time (t1/2) in seconds, determined by fluorescence recovery experiments in living cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, measured in minutes. These two states are related: the larger the t1/2, the longer the ChIP occupancy resulting in increased transcription. Here we present data showing that this relationship does not always hold. We found that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) significantly increased t1/2 of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused androgen receptor (AR) on a tandem array of positive hormone response elements (HREs) in chromatin. This resulted in increased ChIP signal of GFP-AR. Unexpectedly, however, transcription was inhibited. In contrast, the GFP-fused glucocorticoid receptor (GR), acting through the same HREs, displayed a profile consistent with current models. We provide evidence that these differences are mediated, at least in part, by HDACs. Our results provide insight into TF action in living cells and show that very closely related TFs may trigger significantly divergent outcomes at the same REs."
https://openalex.org/W2253620427,"We study rank-frequency relations for phonemes, the minimal units that still relate to linguistic meaning. We show that these relations can be described by the Dirichlet distribution, a direct analogue of the ideal-gas model in statistical mechanics. This description allows us to demonstrate that the rank-frequency relations for phonemes of a text do depend on its author. The author-dependency effect is not caused by the author’s vocabulary (common words used in different texts), and is confirmed by several alternative means. This suggests that it can be directly related to phonemes. These features contrast to rank-frequency relations for words, which are both author and text independent and are governed by the Zipf’s law."
https://openalex.org/W2313324686,"The maternal-to-embryonic transition (MET) is a complex process that occurs during early mammalian embryogenesis and is characterized by activation of the zygotic genome, initiation of embryonic transcription, and replacement of maternal mRNA with embryonic mRNA. The objective of this study was to reveal the temporal expression and localization patterns of PTTG1 during early porcine embryonic development and to establish a relationship between PTTG1 and the MET. To achieve this goal, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to clone porcine PTTG1. Subsequently, germinal vesicle (GV)- and metaphase II (MII)-stage oocytes, zygotes, 2-, 4-, and 8-cell-stage embryos, morulas, and blastocysts were produced in vitro and their gene expression was analyzed. The results revealed that the coding sequence of porcine PTTG1 is 609-bp in length and that it encodes a 202-aa polypeptide. Using qRT-PCR, PTTG1 mRNA expression was observed to be maintained at high levels in GV- and MII-stage oocytes. The transcript levels in oocytes were also significantly higher than those in embryos from the zygote to blastocyst stages. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that porcine PTTG1 was primarily localized to the cytoplasm and partially localized to the nucleus. Furthermore, the PTTG1 protein levels in MII-stage oocytes and zygotes were significantly higher than those in embryos from the 2-cell to blastocyst stage. After fertilization, the level of this protein began to decrease gradually until the blastocyst stage. The results of our study suggest that porcine PTTG1 is a new candidate maternal effect gene (MEG) that may participate in the processes of oocyte maturation and zygotic genome activation during porcine embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2281289292,"In a connected world where people influence each other, what can cause a globalized monoculture, and which measures help to preserve the coexistence of cultures? Previous research has shown that factors such as homophily, population size, geography, mass media, and type of social influence play important roles. In the present paper, we investigate for the first time the impact that institutions have on cultural diversity. In our first three studies, we extend existing agent-based models and explore the effects of institutional influence and agent loyalty. We find that higher institutional influence increases cultural diversity, while individuals' loyalty to their institutions has a small, preserving effect. In three further studies, we test how bottom-up and top-down processes of institutional influence impact our model. We find that bottom-up democratic practices, such as referenda, tend to produce convergence towards homogeneity, while top-down information dissemination practices, such as propaganda, further increase diversity. In our last model—an integration of bottom-up and top-down processes into a feedback loop of information—we find that when democratic processes are rare, the effects of propaganda are amplified, i.e., more diversity emerges; however, when democratic processes are common, they are able to neutralize or reverse this propaganda effect. Importantly, our models allow for control over the full spectrum of diversity, so that a manipulation of our parameters can result in preferred levels of diversity, which will be useful for the study of other factors in the future. We discuss possible mechanisms behind our results, applications, and implications for political and social sciences."
