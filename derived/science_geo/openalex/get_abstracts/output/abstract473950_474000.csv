https://openalex.org/W1963835526,"Over the last few years, circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising novel and minimally invasive markers for various diseases, including cancer. We already showed that certain miRNAs are deregulated in the plasma of breast cancer patients when compared to healthy women. Herein we have further explored their potential to serve as breast cancer early detection markers in blood plasma. Circulating miR-127-3p, miR-376a and miR-652, selected as candidates from a miRNA array-based screening, were found to be associated with breast cancer for the first time (n = 417). Further we validated our previously reported circulating miRNAs (miR-148b, miR-376c, miR-409-3p and miR-801) in an independent cohort (n = 210) as elevated in the plasma of breast cancer patients compared to healthy women. We described, for the first time in breast cancer, an over-representation of deregulated miRNAs (miR-127-3p, miR-376a, miR-376c and miR-409-3p) originating from the chromosome 14q32 region. The inclusion of patients with benign breast tumors enabled the observation that miR-148b, miR-652 and miR-801 levels are even elevated in the plasma of women with benign tumors when compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, an analysis of samples stratified by cancer stage demonstrated that miR-127-3p, miR-148b, miR-409-3p, miR-652 and miR-801 can detect also stage I or stage II breast cancer thus making them attractive candidates for early detection. Finally, ROC curve analysis showed that a panel of these seven circulating miRNAs has substantial diagnostic potential with an AUC of 0.81 for the detection of benign and malignant breast tumors, which further increased to 0.86 in younger women (up to 50 years of age)."
https://openalex.org/W1990223774,"In protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, functional similarity is often inferred based on the function of directly interacting proteins, or more generally, some notion of interaction network proximity among proteins in a local neighborhood. Prior methods typically measure proximity as the shortest-path distance in the network, but this has only a limited ability to capture fine-grained neighborhood distinctions, because most proteins are close to each other, and there are many ties in proximity. We introduce diffusion state distance (DSD), a new metric based on a graph diffusion property, designed to capture finer-grained distinctions in proximity for transfer of functional annotation in PPI networks. We present a tool that, when input a PPI network, will output the DSD distances between every pair of proteins. We show that replacing the shortest-path metric by DSD improves the performance of classical function prediction methods across the board."
https://openalex.org/W2121899797,"Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), a pivotal enzyme in the kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan degradation, has been suggested to play a major role in physiological and pathological events involving bioactive KP metabolites. To explore this role in greater detail, we generated mice with a targeted genetic disruption of Kmo and present here the first biochemical and neurochemical characterization of these mutant animals. Kmo(-/-) mice lacked KMO activity but showed no obvious abnormalities in the activity of four additional KP enzymes tested. As expected, Kmo(-/-) mice showed substantial reductions in the levels of its enzymatic product, 3-hydroxykynurenine, in liver, brain, and plasma. Compared with wild-type animals, the levels of the downstream metabolite quinolinic acid were also greatly decreased in liver and plasma of the mutant mice but surprisingly were only slightly reduced (by ∼20%) in the brain. The levels of three other KP metabolites: kynurenine, kynurenic acid, and anthranilic acid, were substantially, but differentially, elevated in the liver, brain, and plasma of Kmo(-/-) mice, whereas the liver and brain content of the major end product of the enzymatic cascade, NAD(+), did not differ between Kmo(-/-) and wild-type animals. When assessed by in vivo microdialysis, extracellular kynurenic acid levels were found to be significantly elevated in the brains of Kmo(-/-) mice. Taken together, these results provide further evidence that KMO plays a key regulatory role in the KP and indicate that Kmo(-/-) mice will be useful for studying tissue-specific functions of individual KP metabolites in health and disease."

The Rx N-terminal CC domain undergoes an intramolecular interaction with the Rx NB-LRR region and an intermolecular interaction with the Rx cofactor RanGAP2 (Ran GTPase-activating protein 2). Here, we report the crystal structure of the Rx CC domain in complex with the Trp-Pro-Pro (WPP) domain of RanGAP2. The structure reveals that the Rx CC domain forms a heterodimer with RanGAP2, in striking contrast to the homodimeric structure of the CC domain of the barley disease resistance protein MLA10. Structure-based mutagenesis identified residues from both the Rx CC domain and the RanGAP2 WPP domain that are crucial for their interaction and function in vitro and in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2098893487,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability. Following the initial insult, severe TBI progresses to a secondary injury phase associated with biochemical and cellular changes. The secondary injury is thought to be responsible for the development of many of the neurological deficits observed after TBI and also provides a window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9 or gelatinase B) expression is elevated in neurological diseases and its activation is an important factor in detrimental outcomes including excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, and increases in inflammatory responses and astrogliosis. In this study, we used an experimental mouse model of TBI to examine the role of MMP-9 and the therapeutic potential of SB-3CT, a mechanism-based gelatinase selective inhibitor, in ameliorating the secondary injury. We observed that activation of MMP-9 occurred within one day following TBI, and remained elevated for 7 days after the initial insult. SB-3CT effectively attenuated MMP-9 activity, reduced brain lesion volumes and prevented neuronal loss and dendritic degeneration. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that SB-3CT and its active metabolite, p-OH SB-3CT, were rapidly absorbed and distributed to the brain. Moreover, SB-3CT treatment mitigated microglial activation and astrogliosis after TBI. Importantly, SB-3CT treatment improved long-term neurobehavioral outcomes, including sensorimotor function, and hippocampus-associated spatial learning and memory. These results demonstrate that MMP-9 is a key target for therapy to attenuate secondary injury cascades and that this class of mechanism-based gelatinase inhibitor-with such desirable pharmacokinetic properties-holds considerable promise as a potential pharmacological treatment of TBI."
https://openalex.org/W1977956600,"The neutrophil enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) promotes oxidative stress in numerous inflammatory pathologies by producing hypohalous acids. Its inadvertent activity is a prime target for pharmacological control. Previously, salicylhydroxamic acid was reported to be a weak reversible inhibitor of MPO. We aimed to identify related hydroxamates that are good inhibitors of the enzyme. We report on three hydroxamates as the first potent reversible inhibitors of MPO. The chlorination activity of purified MPO was inhibited by 50% by a 5 nm concentration of a trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatic hydroxamate, HX1. The hydroxamates were specific for MPO in neutrophils and more potent toward MPO compared with a broad range of redox enzymes and alternative targets. Surface plasmon resonance measurements showed that the strength of binding of hydroxamates to MPO correlated with the degree of enzyme inhibition. The crystal structure of MPO-HX1 revealed that the inhibitor was bound within the active site cavity above the heme and blocked the substrate channel. HX1 was a mixed-type inhibitor of the halogenation activity of MPO with respect to both hydrogen peroxide and halide. Spectral analyses demonstrated that hydroxamates can act variably as substrates for MPO and convert the enzyme to a nitrosyl ferrous intermediate. This property was unrelated to their ability to inhibit MPO. We propose that aromatic hydroxamates bind tightly to the active site of MPO and prevent it from producing hypohalous acids. This mode of reversible inhibition has potential for blocking the activity of MPO and limiting oxidative stress during inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2055773216,"Epigenetic regulation mediated by lysine- and arginine-specific enzymes plays an essential role in tumorigenesis, and enhanced expression of the type II protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 as well as the polycomb repressor complex PRC2 has been associated with increased cell proliferation and survival. Here, we show that PRMT5 is overexpressed in three different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines and clinical samples as well as in mouse primary lymphoma cells and that it up-regulates PRC2 expression through inactivation of the retinoblastoma proteins RB1 and RBL2. Although PRMT5 epigenetically controls RBL2 expression, it indirectly promotes RB1 phosphorylation through enhanced cyclin D1 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PRMT5 knockdown in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines and mouse primary lymphoma cells leads to RBL2 derepression and RB1 reactivation, which in turn inhibit PRC2 expression and trigger derepression of its CASP10, DAP1, HOXA5, and HRK pro-apoptotic target genes. We also show that reduced PRMT5 expression leads to cyclin D1 transcriptional repression via loss of TP53K372 methylation, which results in decreased BCL3 expression and enhanced recruitment of NF-κB p52-HDAC1 repressor complexes to the cyclin D1 promoter. These findings indicate that PRMT5 is a master epigenetic regulator that governs expression of its own target genes and those regulated by PRC2 and that its inhibition could offer a promising therapeutic strategy for lymphoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W1973965766,"The ancestor of Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421T is believed to have diverged from that of all known cyanobacteria before the evolution of thylakoid membranes and plant plastids. The long and largely independent evolutionary history of G. violaceus presents an organism retaining ancestral features of early oxygenic photoautotrophs, and in whom cyanobacteria evolution can be investigated. No other Gloeobacter species has been described since the genus was established in 1974 (Rippka et al., Arch Microbiol 100:435). Gloeobacter affiliated ribosomal gene sequences have been reported in environmental DNA libraries, but only the type strain's genome has been sequenced. However, we report here the cultivation of a new Gloeobacter species, G. kilaueensis JS1T, from an epilithic biofilm in a lava cave in Kīlauea Caldera, Hawai'i. The strain's genome was sequenced from an enriched culture resembling a low-complexity metagenomic sample, using 9 kb paired-end 454 pyrosequences and 400 bp paired-end Illumina reads. The JS1T and G. violaceus PCC 7421T genomes have little gene synteny despite sharing 2842 orthologous genes; comparing the genomes shows they do not belong to the same species. Our results support establishing a new species to accommodate JS1T, for which we propose the name Gloeobacter kilaueensis sp. nov. Strain JS1T has been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (BAA-2537), the Scottish Marine Institute's Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa (CCAP 1431/1), and the Belgian Coordinated Collections of Microorganisms (ULC0316). The G. kilaueensis holotype has been deposited in the Algal Collection of the US National Herbarium (US# 217948). The JS1T genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank under accession number CP003587. The G+C content of the genome is 60.54 mol%. The complete genome sequence of G. kilaueensis JS1T may further understanding of cyanobacteria evolution, and the shift from anoxygenic to oxygenic photosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2061710056,"Many transcripts expressed from plant organelle genomes are modified by C-to-U RNA editing. Nuclear encoded pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are required as RNA binding specificity determinants in the RNA editing mechanism. Bioinformatic analysis has shown that most of the Arabidopsis PPR proteins necessary for RNA editing events include a C-terminal portion that shares structural characteristics with a superfamily of deaminases. The DYW deaminase domain includes a highly conserved zinc binding motif that shares characteristics with cytidine deaminases. The Arabidopsis PPR genes, ELI1 and DOT4, both have DYW deaminase domains and are required for single RNA editing events in chloroplasts. The ELI1 DYW deaminase domain was expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and was shown to bind two zinc atoms per polypeptide. Thus, the DYW deaminase domain binds a zinc metal ion, as expected for a cytidine deaminase, and is potentially the catalytic component of an editing complex. Genetic complementation experiments demonstrate that large portions of the DYW deaminase domain of ELI1 may be eliminated, but the truncated genes retain the ability to restore editing site conversion in a mutant plant. These results suggest that the catalytic activity can be supplied in trans by uncharacterized protein(s) of the editosome."
https://openalex.org/W2021877458,"25-Hydroxycholesterol (25OHC) is an enzymatically derived oxidation product of cholesterol that modulates lipid metabolism and immunity. 25OHC is synthesized in response to interferons and exerts broad antiviral activity by as yet poorly characterized mechanisms. To gain further insights into the basis for antiviral activity, we evaluated time-dependent responses of the macrophage lipidome and transcriptome to 25OHC treatment. In addition to altering specific aspects of cholesterol and sphingolipid metabolism, we found that 25OHC activates integrated stress response (ISR) genes and reprograms protein translation. Effects of 25OHC on ISR gene expression were independent of liver X receptors and sterol-response element-binding proteins and instead primarily resulted from activation of the GCN2/eIF2α/ATF4 branch of the ISR pathway. These studies reveal that 25OHC activates the integrated stress response, which may contribute to its antiviral activity."
https://openalex.org/W2171225927,"In plants, transient changes in calcium concentrations of cytosol have been observed during stress conditions like high salt, drought, extreme temperature and mechanical disturbances. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play important roles in relaying these calcium signatures into downstream effects. In this study, a stress-responsive CDPK gene, ZoCDPK1 was isolated from a stress cDNA generated from ginger using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) – PCR technique and characterized its role in stress tolerance. An important aspect seen during the analysis of the deduced protein is a rare coupling between the presence of a nuclear localization sequence in the junction domain and consensus sequence in the EF-hand loops of calmodulin-like domain. ZoCDPK1 is abundantly expressed in rhizome and is rapidly induced by high-salt stress, drought, and jasmonic acid treatment but not by low temperature stress or abscissic acid treatment. The sub-cellular localization of ZoCDPK1-GFP fusion protein was studied in transgenic tobacco epidermal cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Over-expression of ginger CDPK1 gene in tobacco conferred tolerance to salinity and drought stress as reflected by the high percentage of seed germination, higher relative water content, expression of stress responsive genes, higher leaf chlorophyll content, increased photosynthetic efficiency and other photosynthetic parameters. In addition, transgenic tobacco subjected to salinity/drought stress exhibited 50% more growth during stress conditions as compared to wild type plant during normal conditions. T3 transgenic plants are able to grow to maturity, flowers early and set viable seeds under continuous salinity or drought stress without yield penalty. The ZoCDPK1 up-regulated the expression levels of stress-related genes RD21A and ERD1 in tobacco plants. These results suggest that ZoCDPK1 functions in the positive regulation of the signaling pathways that are involved in the response to salinity and drought stress in ginger and it is likely operating in a DRE/CRT independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2067646042,"How do humans perceive the passage of time and the duration of events without a dedicated sensory system for timing? Previous studies have demonstrated that when a stimulus changes over time, its duration is subjectively dilated, indicating that duration judgments are based on the number of changes within an interval. In this study, we tested predictions derived from three different accounts describing the relation between a changing stimulus and its subjective duration as either based on (1) the objective rate of changes of the stimulus, (2) the perceived saliency of the changes, or (3) the neural energy expended in processing the stimulus. We used visual stimuli flickering at different frequencies (4-166 Hz) to study how the number of changes affects subjective duration. To this end, we assessed the subjective duration of these stimuli and measured participants' behavioral flicker fusion threshold (the highest frequency perceived as flicker), as well as their threshold for a frequency-specific neural response to the flicker using EEG. We found that only consciously perceived flicker dilated perceived duration, such that a 2 s long stimulus flickering at 4 Hz was perceived as lasting as long as a 2.7 s steady stimulus. This effect was most pronounced at the slowest flicker frequencies, at which participants reported the most consistent flicker perception. Flicker frequencies higher than the flicker fusion threshold did not affect perceived duration at all, even if they evoked a significant frequency-specific neural response. In sum, our findings indicate that time perception in the peri-second range is driven by the subjective saliency of the stimulus' temporal features rather than the objective rate of stimulus changes or the neural response to the changes."
https://openalex.org/W2144217996,"Despite the recognized importance of the dorsal raphe (DR) serotonergic (5-HT) nuclei in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety, the molecular components/putative drug targets expressed by these neurons are poorly characterized. Utilizing the promoter of an ETS domain transcription factor that is a stable marker of 5-HT neurons (Pet-1) to drive 5-HT neuronal expression of YFP, we identified 5-HT neurons in live acute slices. We isolated RNA from single 5-HT neurons in the ventromedial and lateral wings of the DR and performed single-cell RNA-Seq analysis identifying >500 G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) including receptors for classical transmitters, lipid signals, and peptides as well as dozens of orphan-GPCRs. Using these data to inform our selection of receptors to assess, we found that oxytocin and lysophosphatidic acid 1 receptors are translated and active in costimulating, with the α1-adrenergic receptor, the firing of DR 5-HT neurons, while the effects of histamine are inhibitory and exerted at H3 histamine receptors. The inhibitory histamine response provides evidence for tonic in vivo histamine inhibition of 5-HT neurons. This study illustrates that unbiased single-cell transcriptomics coupled with functional analyses provides novel insights into how neurons and neuronal systems are regulated.—Spaethling, J.

https://openalex.org/W2058989287,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is accompanied by structural alterations and dysfunction in central autonomic regulatory regions, which may impair dynamic and static cardiovascular regulation, and contribute to other syndrome pathologies. Characterizing cardiovascular responses to autonomic challenges may provide insights into central nervous system impairments, including contributions by sex, since structural alterations are enhanced in OSA females over males. The objective was to assess heart rate responses in OSA versus healthy control subjects to autonomic challenges, and, separately, characterize female and male patterns. We studied 94 subjects, including 37 newly-diagnosed, untreated OSA patients (6 female, age mean ± std: 52.1 ± 8.1 years; 31 male aged 54.3 ± 8.4 years), and 57 healthy control subjects (20 female, 50.5 ± 8.1 years; 37 male, 45.6 ± 9.2 years). We measured instantaneous heart rate with pulse oximetry during cold pressor, hand grip, and Valsalva maneuver challenges. All challenges elicited significant heart rate differences between OSA and control groups during and after challenges (repeated measures ANOVA, p<0.05). In post-hoc analyses, OSA females showed greater impairments than OSA males, which included: for cold pressor, lower initial increase (OSA vs. control: 9.5 vs. 7.3 bpm in females, 7.6 vs. 3.7 bpm in males), OSA delay to initial peak (2.5 s females/0.9 s males), slower mid-challenge rate-of-increase (OSA vs. control: -0.11 vs. 0.09 bpm/s in females, 0.03 vs. 0.06 bpm/s in males); for hand grip, lower initial peak (OSA vs. control: 2.6 vs. 4.6 bpm in females, 5.3 vs. 6.0 bpm in males); for Valsalva maneuver, lower Valsalva ratio (OSA vs. control: 1.14 vs. 1.30 in females, 1.29 vs. 1.34 in males), and OSA delay during phase II (0.68 s females/1.31 s males). Heart rate responses showed lower amplitude, delayed onset, and slower rate changes in OSA patients over healthy controls, and impairments may be more pronounced in females. The dysfunctions may reflect central injury in the syndrome, and suggest autonomic deficiencies that may contribute to further tissue and functional pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W1993415838,"Gain-of-function mutations in the calcium channel TRPC6 lead to autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and podocyte expression of TRPC6 is increased in some acquired human glomerular diseases, particularly in membranous nephropathy. These observations led to the hypothesis that TRPC6 overactivation is deleterious to podocytes through pathological calcium signaling, both in genetic and acquired diseases. Here, we show that the effects of TRPC6 on podocyte function are context-dependent. Overexpression of TRPC6 alone did not directly affect podocyte morphology and cytoskeletal structure. Unexpectedly, however, overexpression of TRPC6 protected podocytes from complement-mediated injury, whereas genetic or pharmacological TRPC6 inactivation increased podocyte susceptibility to complement. Mechanistically, this effect was mediated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation. Podocyte-specific TRPC6 transgenic mice showed stronger CaMKII activation, reduced podocyte foot process effacement and reduced levels of proteinuria during nephrotoxic serum nephritis, whereas TRPC6 null mice exhibited reduced CaMKII activation and higher levels of proteinuria compared with wild type littermates. Human membranous nephropathy biopsy samples showed podocyte staining for active CaMKII, which correlated with the degree of TRPC6 expression. Together, these data suggest a dual and context dependent role of TRPC6 in podocytes where acute activation protects from complement-mediated damage, but chronic overactivation leads to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2102356410,"Research has shown that individuals have an optimal walking speed-a speed which minimizes energy expenditure for a given distance. Because the optimal walking speed varies with mass and lower limb length, it also varies with sex, with males in any given population tending to have faster optimal walking speeds. This potentially creates an energetic dilemma for mixed-sex walking groups. Here we examine speed choices made by individuals of varying stature, mass, and sex walking together. Individuals (N = 22) walked around a track alone, with a significant other (with and without holding hands), and with friends of the same and opposite sex while their speeds were recorded every 100 m. Our findings show that males walk at a significantly slower pace to match the females' paces (p = 0.009), when the female is their romantic partner. The paces of friends of either same or mixed sex walking together did not significantly change (p>0.05). Thus significant pace adjustment appears to be limited to romantic partners. These findings have implications for both mobility and reproductive strategies of groups. Because the male carries the energetic burden by adjusting his pace (slowing down 7%), the female is spared the potentially increased caloric cost required to walk together. In energetically demanding environments, we will expect to find gender segregation in group composition, particularly when travelling longer distances."
https://openalex.org/W1752340230,"The “sicker sex” idea summarizes our knowledge of sex biases in parasite burden and immune ability whereby males fare worse than females. The theoretical basis of this is that because males invest more on mating effort than females, the former pay the costs by having a weaker immune system and thus being more susceptible to parasites. Females, conversely, have a greater parental investment. Here we tested the following: a) whether both sexes differ in their ability to defend against parasites using a natural host-parasite system; b) the differences in resource allocation conflict between mating effort and parental investment traits between sexes; and, c) effect of parasitism on survival for both sexes. We used a number of insect damselfly species as study subjects. For (a), we quantified gregarine and mite parasites, and experimentally manipulated gregarine levels in both sexes during adult ontogeny. For (b), first, we manipulated food during adult ontogeny and recorded thoracic fat gain (a proxy of mating effort) and abdominal weight (a proxy of parental investment) in both sexes. Secondly for (b), we manipulated food and gregarine levels in both sexes when adults were about to become sexually mature, and recorded gregarine number. For (c), we infected male and female adults of different ages and measured their survival. Males consistently showed more parasites than females apparently due to an increased resource allocation to fat production in males. Conversely, females invested more on abdominal weight. These differences were independent of how much food/infecting parasites were provided. The cost of this was that males had more parasites and reduced survival than females. Our results provide a resource allocation mechanism for understanding sexual differences in parasite defense as well as survival consequences for each sex."
https://openalex.org/W2099324783,"Background Obstetric hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality. Using a cluster randomized design, we investigated whether application of the Non-pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment (NASG) before transport to referral hospitals (RHs) from primary health care centers (PHCs) decreased adverse outcomes among women with hypovolemic shock. We hypothesized the NASG group would have a 50% reduction in adverse outcomes. Methods and Findings We randomly assigned 38 PHCs in Zambia and Zimbabwe to standard obstetric hemorrhage/shock protocols or the same protocols plus NASG prior to transport. All women received the NASG at the RH. The primary outcomes were maternal mortality; severe, end-organ failure maternal morbidity; and a composite mortality/morbidity outcome, which we labeled extreme adverse outcome (EAO). We also examined whether the NASG contributed to negative side effects and secondary outcomes. The sample size for statistical power was not reached; of a planned 2400 women, 880 were enrolled, 405 in the intervention group. The intervention was associated with a non-significant 46% reduced odds of mortality (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.14–2.05, p = 0.37) and 54% reduction in composite EAO (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.13–1.62, p = 0.22). Women with NASGs recovered from shock significantly faster (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.02–1.52, p = 0.03). No differences were observed in secondary outcomes or negative effects. The main limitation was small sample size. Conclusions Despite a lack of statistical significance, the 54% reduced odds of EAO and the significantly faster shock recovery suggest there might be treatment benefits from earlier application of the NASG for women experiencing delays obtaining definitive treatment for hypovolemic shock. As there are no other tools for shock management outside of referral facilities, and no safety issues found, consideration of NASGs as a temporizing measure during delays may be warranted. A pragmatic study with rigorous evaluation is suggested for further research. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00488462"
https://openalex.org/W1967878515,This paper reports on an investigation of mass transport of blood cells at micro-scale stenosis where local strain-rate micro-gradients trigger platelet aggregation. Using a microfluidic flow focusing platform we investigate the blood flow streams that principally contribute to platelet aggregation under shear micro-gradient conditions. We demonstrate that relatively thin surface streams located at the channel wall are the primary contributor of platelets to the developing aggregate under shear gradient conditions. Furthermore we delineate a role for red blood cell hydrodynamic lift forces in driving enhanced advection of platelets to the stenosis wall and surface of developing aggregates. We show that this novel microfluidic platform can be effectively used to study the role of mass transport phenomena driving platelet recruitment and aggregate formation and believe that this approach will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying shear-gradient dependent discoid platelet aggregation in the context of cardiovascular diseases such as acute coronary syndromes and ischemic stroke.
https://openalex.org/W2048283487,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are targets of general anesthetics, but functional sensitivity to anesthetic inhibition varies dramatically among different subtypes of nAChRs. Potential causes underlying different functional responses to anesthetics remain elusive. Here we show that in contrast to the α7 nAChR, the α7β2 nAChR is highly susceptible to inhibition by the volatile anesthetic isoflurane in electrophysiology measurements. Isoflurane-binding sites in β2 and α7 were found at the extracellular and intracellular end of their respective transmembrane domains using NMR. Functional relevance of the identified β2 site was validated via point mutations and subsequent functional measurements. Consistent with their functional responses to isoflurane, β2 but not α7 showed pronounced dynamics changes, particularly for the channel gate residue Leu-249(9'). These results suggest that anesthetic binding alone is not sufficient to generate functional impact; only those sites that can modulate channel dynamics upon anesthetic binding will produce functional effects."
https://openalex.org/W2107063500,"The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) is a central metabolic pathway that provides energy, reducing potential, and biosynthetic intermediates. In Staphylococcus aureus, TCA cycle activity is controlled by several regulators (e.g. CcpA, CodY, and RpiRc) in response to the availability of sugars, amino acids, and environmental stress. Developing a bioinformatic search for additional carbon catabolite-responsive regulators in S. aureus, we identified a LysR-type regulator, catabolite control protein E (CcpE), with homology to the Bacillus subtilis CcpC regulator. Inactivation of ccpE in S. aureus strain Newman revealed that CcpE is a positive transcriptional effector of the first two enzymes of the TCA cycle, aconitase (citB) and to a lesser extent citrate synthase (citZ). Consistent with the transcriptional data, aconitase activity dramatically decreased in the ccpE mutant relative to the wild-type strain. The effect of ccpE inactivation on citB transcription and the lesser effect on citZ transcription were also reflected in electrophoretic mobility shift assays where CcpE bound to the citB promoter but not the citZ promoter. Metabolomic studies showed that inactivation of ccpE resulted in increased intracellular concentrations of acetate, citrate, lactate, and alanine, consistent with a redirection of carbon away from the TCA cycle.

Taken together, our data suggest that CcpE is a major direct positive regulator of the TCA cycle gene citB."
https://openalex.org/W1993340457,"Predicting the subcellular localization of proteins conquers the major drawbacks of high-throughput localization experiments that are costly and time-consuming. However, current subcellular localization predictors are limited in scope and accuracy. In particular, most predictors perform well on certain locations or with certain data sets while poorly on others. Here, we present PSI, a novel high accuracy web server for plant subcellular localization prediction. PSI derives the wisdom of multiple specialized predictors via a joint-approach of group decision making strategy and machine learning methods to give an integrated best result. The overall accuracy obtained (up to 93.4%) was higher than best individual (CELLO) by ∼10.7%. The precision of each predicable subcellular location (more than 80%) far exceeds that of the individual predictors. It can also deal with multi-localization proteins. PSI is expected to be a powerful tool in protein location engineering as well as in plant sciences, while the strategy employed could be applied to other integrative problems. A user-friendly web server, PSI, has been developed for free access at http://bis.zju.edu.cn/psi/."
https://openalex.org/W2043206896,"The box jellyfish Alatina moseri forms monthly aggregations at Waikiki Beach 8–12 days after each full moon, posing a recurrent hazard to swimmers due to painful stings. We present an analysis of long-term (14 years: Jan 1998– Dec 2011) changes in box jellyfish abundance at Waikiki Beach. We tested the relationship of beach counts to climate and biogeochemical variables over time in the North Pacific Sub-tropical Gyre (NPSG). Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Change-Point Analysis (CPA), and General Regression Models (GRM) were used to characterize patterns in box jellyfish arrival at Waikiki Beach 8–12 days following 173 consecutive full moons. Variation in box jellyfish abundance lacked seasonality, but exhibited dramatic differences among months and among years, and followed an oscillating pattern with significant periods of increase (1998–2001; 2006–2011) and decrease (2001–2006). Of three climatic and 12 biogeochemical variables examined, box jellyfish showed a strong, positive relationship with primary production, >2 mm zooplankton biomass, and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index. It is clear that that the moon cycle plays a key role in synchronizing timing of the arrival of Alatina moseri medusae to shore. We propose that bottom-up processes, likely initiated by inter-annual regional climatic fluctuations influence primary production, secondary production, and ultimately regulate food availability, and are therefore important in controlling the inter-annual changes in box jellyfish abundance observed at Waikiki Beach."
https://openalex.org/W1973343254,"B7-H3 is a recently discovered member of the B7 superfamily molecules and has been found to play a negative role in T cell responses. In this study, we identified a new B7-H3 isoform that is produced by alternative splicing from the forth intron of B7-H3 and encodes the sB7-H3 protein. Protein sequence analysis showed that sB7-H3 contains an additional four amino acids, encoded by the intron sequence, at the C-terminus compared to the ectodomain of 2Ig-B7-H3. We further found that this spliced sB7-H3 plays a negative regulatory role in T cell responses and serum sB7-H3 is higher in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than in healthy donors. Furthermore, we found that the expression of the spliced sb7-h3 gene is higher in carcinoma and peritumor tissues than in PBMCs of both healthy controls and patients, indicating that the high level of serum sB7-H3 in patients with HCC is caused by the increased expression of this newly discovered spliced sB7-H3 isoform in carcinoma and peritumor tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2137505472,"Elevated glucagon levels and increased hepatic glucagon receptor (GCGR) signaling contribute to hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. We have identified a monoclonal antibody that inhibits GCGR, a class B G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), through a unique allosteric mechanism. Receptor inhibition is mediated by the binding of this antibody to two distinct sites that lie outside of the glucagon binding cleft. One site consists of a patch of residues that are surface-exposed on the face of the extracellular domain (ECD) opposite the ligand-binding cleft, whereas the second binding site consists of residues in the αA helix of the ECD. A docking model suggests that the antibody does not occlude the ligand-binding cleft. We solved the crystal structure of GCGR ECD containing a naturally occurring G40S mutation and found a shift in the register of the αA helix that prevents antibody binding. We also found that alterations in the αA helix impact the normal function of GCGR. We present a model for the allosteric inhibition of GCGR by a monoclonal antibody that may form the basis for the development of allosteric modulators for the treatment of diabetes and other class B GPCR-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1971061691,"Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a recessive inborn error of metabolism characterized by elevated serum total homocysteine (tHcy). Previously, our laboratory developed a mouse model of CBS deficiency, TgI278T Cbs-/- (abbreviated as Cbs-/-), characterized by low weight, low adiposity, decreased Scd-1 expression, facial alopecia, and osteoporosis. To determine the potential benefit of a methionine-restricted diet (MRD), we fed Cbs-/- and Cbs+/- control mice either an MRD or a regular diet (RD) from weaning till 240 d of age. Cbs-/- mice fed the MRD had a 77% decrease in tHcy, 28% increase in weight, 130% increase in fat mass, 82% increase in Scd-1 expression, and 10.6% increase in bone density and entirely lacked the alopecia phenotype observed in age-matched Cbs-/- mice fed the RD. At the end of the study, Cbs-/- mice fed the MRD were phenotypically indistinguishable from Cbs+/- mice fed the RD. Notably, whereas the MRD diet was highly beneficial to Cbs-/- mice, it had nearly opposite effect on Cbs+/- mice. These studies show that a low-methionine diet can correct the phenotypic consequences of loss of CBS and provide a striking example of how genotype and diet can interact to influence phenotype in mammals.—Gupta, S., Melnyk, S.B., Kruger, W.D.

https://openalex.org/W2127344614,"Renal pacemakers set the origin and frequency of the smooth muscle contractions that propel wastes from the kidney to the bladder. Although congenital defects impairing this peristalsis are a leading cause of pediatric renal failure, the mechanisms underlying renal pacemaker activity remain unknown. Using ratiometric optical mapping and video microscopy, we discovered that hyperpolarization-activated cation (HCN) channel block with the specific anatagonist ZD7288 (30 μm; IC50) abolished the pacemaker depolarizations that initiate murine upper urinary tract peristalsis. Optical mapping and immunohistochemistry indicate that pacemaker potentials are generated by cells expressing HCN isoform-3, and that HCN3+ cells are coupled to definitive smooth muscle via gap junctions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HCN3+ cells coexpress T-type Ca2+ (TTC) channels and that TTC channel inhibition with R(–)efonidipine or NNC55-0396 decreased contractile frequency in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, these data demonstrate that HCN3+/TTC+ cells are the pacemakers that set the origin and rate of upper urinary tract peristalsis. These results reveal a conserved mechanism controlling autorhythmicity in 2 distinct muscle types, as HCN and TTC channels also mediate cardiac pacemaker activity. Moreover, these findings have translational applications, including the development of novel diagnostics to detect fetal urinary tract motility defects prior to renal damage.—Hurtado, R., Bub, G., Herzlinger, D.

https://openalex.org/W1989330644,"Keratinocyte differentiation is a key process in the formation and maintenance of the protective skin barrier. Dysregulation in the balance of reactive oxygen species homeostasis may play a role in keratinocyte differentiation. We have identified the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 as a key regulator of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in keratinocytes. Our studies demonstrate that SIRT3 expression is down-regulated during keratinocyte differentiation, consistent with an increase in mitochondrial superoxide levels. Importantly, loss of SIRT3 expression in keratinocytes increased superoxide levels and promoted the expression of differentiation markers, whereas overexpression decreased superoxide levels and reduced the expression of differentiation markers. These findings identify a new role for SIRT3 in the suppression of epidermal differentiation via lowering oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2166372458,"Objectives To evaluate the immunological and viral consequences of planned treatment interruptions (PTI) in children with HIV. Design This was an immunological and virological sub-study of the Paediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) 11 trial, which compared CD4-guided PTI of antiretroviral therapy (ART) with continuous therapy (CT) in children. Methods HIV-1 RNA and lymphocyte subsets, including CD4 and CD8 cells, were quantified on fresh samples collected during the study; CD45RA, CD45RO and CD31 subpopulations were evaluated in some centres. For 36 (18 PTI, 18 CT) children, immunophenotyping was performed and cell-associated HIV-1 DNA analysed on stored samples to 48 weeks. Results In the PTI group, CD4 cell count fell rapidly in the first 12 weeks off ART, with decreases in both naïve and memory cells. However, the proportion of CD4 cells expressing CD45RA and CD45RO remained constant in both groups. The increase in CD8 cells in the first 12 weeks off ART in the PTI group was predominantly due to increases in RO-expressing cells. PTI was associated with a rapid and sustained increase in CD4 cells expressing Ki67 and HLA-DR, and increased levels of HIV-1 DNA. Conclusions PTI in children is associated with rapid changes in CD4 and CD8 cells, likely due to increased cell turnover and immune activation. However, children off treatment may be able to maintain stable levels of naïve CD4 cells, at least in proportion to the memory cell pool, which may in part explain the observed excellent CD4 cell recovery with re-introduction of ART."
https://openalex.org/W2006848763,"Bees and eudicot plants both arose in the mid-late Cretaceous, and their co-evolutionary relationships have often been assumed as an important element in the rise of flowering plants. Given the near-complete dependence of bees on eudicots we would expect that major extinction events affecting the latter would have also impacted bees. However, given the very patchy distribution of bees in the fossil record, identifying any such extinctions using fossils is very problematic. Here we use molecular phylogenetic analyses to show that one bee group, the Xylocopinae, originated in the mid-Cretaceous, coinciding with the early radiation of the eudicots. Lineage through time analyses for this bee subfamily show very early diversification, followed by a long period of seemingly no radiation and then followed by rapid diversification in each of the four constituent tribes. These patterns are consistent with both a long-fuse model of radiation and a massive extinction event close to the K-T boundary. We argue that massive extinction is much more plausible than a long fuse, given the historical biogeography of these bees and the diversity of ecological niches that they occupy. Our results suggest that events near the K-T boundary would have disrupted many plant-bee relationships, with major consequences for the subsequent evolution of eudicots and their pollinators."

Kalyanaraman B. Global profiling of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in biological systems. High-throughput real-time analyses.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 2984-2995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide experimental evidence that pancreatic β-cells do not generate peroxynitrite in response to cytokines. This is in contrast to activated macrophages (pretreated with LPS and IFNγ), which produce peroxynitrite when NOX is activated with PKC agonists. In addition, when nitric oxide-treated β-cells are forced to produce superoxide, it affords protection against nitric oxide-mediated toxicity. These findings indicate that cytokine-mediated β-cell damage is dependent on NOS activity and that the reactive species responsible for the toxicity is likely to be nitric oxide or products of nitric oxide oxidation, such as nitrogen dioxide. IL-1 and IFNγ were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Dipropylenetriamine NONOate (DPTA/NO) and SIN-1 were supplied by Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Hydroethidine (HE) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Grand Island, NY). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). RPMI 1640, DMEM, and CMRL-1066 tissue culture media were from Invitrogen. FBS and fetal calf serum were purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. INS 832/13 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. To induce iNOS expression and production of nitric oxide in cells, INS832/13 cells were exposed to IL-1 (10 units/ml) and IFNγ (150 units/ml) for 18 h, and RAW 264.7 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (1 μg/ml) and IFNγ (150 units/ml) for 18 h. For real time monitoring of peroxynitrite and superoxide, the cells were washed to remove the tissue culture media and then treated with the fluorescent probe, in the presence and absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (1 μm) or menadione (20 μm) in Dulbecco's PBS containing glucose (5.5 mm) and pyruvate (0.33 mm). Islets were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) by collagenase digestion as previously reported (34Kelly C.B. Blair L.A. Corbett J.A. Scarim A.L. Isolation of islets of Langerhans from rodent pancreas.Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 83: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar) and were cultured overnight in CMRL-1066 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To induce nitric oxide production by iNOS, islets were exposed to IL-1β (10 units/ml) for 18 h. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the Medical College of Wisconsin have approved all animal care and experimental procedures. Cell viability was determined using the neutral red dye uptake assay as previously outlined (35Repetto G. del Peso A. Zurita J.L. Neutral red uptake assay for the estimation of cell viability/cytotoxicity.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 36Steer S.A. Scarim A.L. Chambers K.T. Corbett J.A. Interleukin-1 stimulates beta-cell necrosis and release of the immunological adjuvant HMGB1.PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, INS832/13 cells were cultured on 96-well plates in 100 μl of complete media. After the treatment, the media were replaced with complete culture medium containing 40 μg/ml neutral red, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The medium was then removed, and cells were fixed with formaldehyde (1%, (v/v) in 1% CaCl2 (w/v)). Neutral red was extracted from the cells in 100 μl of 50% ethanol containing 1% acetic acid (v/v). The absorbance was read at 540 nm, and viability was calculated based on the uptake of neutral red by untreated cells. Formation of peroxynitrite was monitored in real time using the selective fluorescent probe coumarin-7-boronate (10 μm). Immediately after addition of the probe, the formation of peroxynitrite was monitored by fluorescence (excitation, 332 nm; emission, 450 nm) for 60 min at 37 °C as previously described (33Zielonka J. Zielonka M. Sikora A. Adamus J. Joseph J. Hardy M. Ouari O. Dranka B.P. Kalyanaraman B. Global profiling of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in biological systems. High-throughput real-time analyses.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 2984-2995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Superoxide production in real time was measured using HE (20 μm). After the addition of HE to cells treated with and without PMA, fluorescence was monitored (excitation, 470 nm; emission, 581 nm) for 60 min at 37 °C. The superoxide-specific oxidation product of HE, 2-hydroxyethidium (2-OH-E+), was analyzed by HPLC as described previously (37Zielonka J. Hardy M. Kalyanaraman B. HPLC study of oxidation products of hydroethidine in chemical and biological systems. Ramifications in superoxide measurements.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 46: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, islets were treated with indicated compounds and HE (10 μm) for 1 h and washed with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS. The islets were pelleted by centrifugation (1,000 × g for 1 min) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Islet pellets were lysed in 75 μl of ice-cold methanol using microcentrifuge-fitted pestle. After centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min), 40 μl of supernatant was mixed with 120 μl of 1 m potassium phosphate, pH 2.6. To measure superoxide in medium, 50 μl of sample was mixed with 150 μl of 1 m potassium phosphate, pH 2.6, containing 25% methanol. Samples were analyzed by HPLC using a Shimadzu Prominence equipped with UV-visible and fluorescent detectors as described previously (38Broniowska K.A. Diers A.R. Corbett J.A. Hogg N. Nitric oxide effect on naphthoquinone toxicity in endothelial cells. Role of bioenergetic dysfunction and PARP activation.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 4364-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide production was determined using the Griess assay, by mixing 50 μl of medium with 50 μl of the Griess reagent (39Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Analysis of nitrate, nitrite, and [15N]nitrate in biological fluids.Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10793) Google Scholar). The absorbance was measured at 540 nm, and nitrite levels were calculated using a standard curve generated with sodium nitrite. Mitochondrial aconitase activity in INS832/13 cells was determined as described previously (14Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Corbett J.A. Irreversible inhibition of metabolic function and islet destruction after a 36-hour exposure to interleukin-1β.Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5301-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, following treatment, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and then incubated with digitonin (0.007% w/v in 20 mm HEPES containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KH2PO4, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) for 15 min on ice. Following the centrifugation (2,000 × g, 15 min), pellets were lysed (30 mm Tris, 30 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.0), and aconitase activity was measured in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm citrate, 0.2 mm NADP+, 6 mm MnCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.6 unit of isocitrate dehydrogenase, and 25 μl of cell extract in a total volume of 100 μl. The increase in absorbance at 340 nm was followed for 30 min at room temperature. Aconitase activity was quantified as 1 pmol of NADPH formed per min per microgram of protein. Equal amounts of cell lysate proteins were resolved using reducing SDS/PAGE and transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) was detected using a phosphospecific antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA; 1:1,000 dilution) and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Statistical comparisons were made between groups using one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey post hoc test. The minimum level of significance was set at p < 0.05. To elucidate the reactive species that mediate cytokine-induced β-cell damage, the effects of iNOS inhibition and scavengers of the nitric oxide metabolite peroxynitrite on cell viability were examined. Treatment of INS832/13 cells for 18 h with IL-1 and IFNγ results in 50% reduction in viability (Fig. 1A). The damaging actions of cytokines on INS832/13 cells are not modified in the presence of the peroxynitrite scavenger phenylalanine boronate (40Sikora A. Zielonka J. Lopez M. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Direct oxidation of boronates by peroxynitrite. Mechanism and implications in fluorescence imaging of peroxynitrite.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar); however, inhibition of iNOS activity with l-NG-monomethyl arginine (l-NMMA) completely prevents the loss of INS832/13 cell viability in response to IL-1 + IFNγ (Fig. 1, A and B). These findings indicate that a product of iNOS (nitric oxide or other nitrogen oxides) mediates the loss of β-cell viability in response to cytokine treatment and that a scavenger of peroxynitrite does not prevent this damage. Because peroxynitrite production requires the reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide, INS832/13 cells were treated with the NADPH oxidase (NOX) activator PMA to facilitate conditions favorable for peroxynitrite generation. In this experiment, cytokine-induced iNOS expression would provide nitric oxide, and PMA, through NOX activation, would induce superoxide production. The addition of PMA does not modify the damaging actions of cytokines on INS832/13 cells. Also, PMA alone does not alter INS832/13 cell viability (Fig. 1B). Because PMA stimulates superoxide formation by NOX through a PKC-dependent pathway (23Curnutte J.T. Erickson R.W. Ding J. Badwey J.A. Reciprocal interactions between protein kinase C and components of the NADPH oxidase complex may regulate superoxide production by neutrophils stimulated with a phorbol ester.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10813-10819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effects of PMA on PKC activation were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 1C, PMA stimulates the time-related phosphorylation of MARCKS (41Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Regulation by phosphorylation of reversible association of a myristoylated protein kinase C substrate with the plasma membrane.Nature. 1991; 351: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These findings show that PMA is capable of stimulating PKC activation in β-cells, even though it does not modify the loss of β-cell viability in response to cytokine treatment. These findings suggest that PMA fails to stimulate superoxide production by β-cell, a finding that is confirmed in studies shown later in this manuscript. The concentration-dependent effects of chemical donors that liberate nitric oxide (DPTA/NO), hydrogen peroxide, superoxide (menadione), and peroxynitrite (SIN-1) on INS832/13 cell viability were measured to directly examine the toxicity of each of these reactive species (Fig. 2). The nitric oxide donor DPTA/NO induces a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability that is maximal at 400 μm (Fig. 2A). There is a steep increase in the toxicity of hydrogen peroxide that occurs at concentrations between 100 and 200 μm, with minimal increases in toxicity above 200 μm (Fig. 2B). Menadione, which generates superoxide by one-electron redox cycling (42Watanabe N. Forman H.J. Autoxidation of extracellular hydroquinones is a causative event for the cytotoxicity of menadione and DMNQ in A549-S cells.Arch. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), does not affect cell viability at concentrations up to 25 μm; however, at concentrations of 50 μm and greater, this superoxide generator is highly toxic to INS832/13 cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, SIN-1, which produces nitric oxide and superoxide during decomposition and is generally considered a peroxynitrite donor, does not reduce the viability of INS832/13 cells at concentrations of 500 μm (Fig. 2D). The generation of peroxynitrite has been confirmed using coumarin-7-boronate (Fig. 2E). This novel probe allows for the quantification of"
https://openalex.org/W2041460781,"The recent outbreak of H7N9 influenza in China is of high concern to public health. H7 hemagglutinin (HA) plays a critical role in influenza entry and thus HA presents an attractive target for antivirals. Previous studies have suggested that the small molecule tert-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) inhibits the entry of influenza H3 HA by binding to the stem loop of HA and stabilizing the neutral pH conformation of HA, thereby disrupting the membrane fusion step. Based on amino acid sequence, structure and immunogenicity, H7 is a related Group 2 HA. In this work we show, using a pseudovirus entry assay, that TBHQ inhibits H7 HA-mediated entry, as well as H3 HA-mediated entry, with an IC50∼6 µM. Using NMR, we show that TBHQ binds to the H7 stem loop region. STD NMR experiments indicate that the aromatic ring of TBHQ makes extensive contact with the H7 HA surface. Limited proteolysis experiments indicate that TBHQ inhibits influenza entry by stabilizing the H7 HA neutral pH conformation. Together, this work suggests that the stem loop region of H7 HA is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention and that TBHQ, which is a widely used food preservative, is a promising lead compound."
https://openalex.org/W1992358439,"The BirA biotin protein ligase of Escherichia coli belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) family of transcriptional regulators. The N-terminal BirA domain is required for both transcriptional regulation of biotin synthesis and biotin protein ligase activity. We addressed the structural and functional role of the wing of the wHTH motif in both BirA functions. A panel of N-terminal deletion mutant proteins including a discrete deletion of the wing motif were unable to bind DNA. However, all the N-terminal deletion mutants weakly complemented growth of a ΔbirA strain at low biotin concentrations, indicating compromised ligase activity. A wing domain chimera was constructed by replacing the BirA wing with the nearly isosteric wing of the E. coli OmpR transcription factor. Although this chimera BirA was defective in operator binding, it was much more efficient in complementation of a ΔbirA strain than was the wing-less protein. The enzymatic activities of the wing deletion and chimera proteins in the in vitro synthesis of biotinoyl-5'-AMP differed greatly. The wing deletion BirA accumulated an off pathway compound, ADP, whereas the chimera protein did not. Finally, we report that a single residue alteration in the wing bypasses the deleterious effects caused by mutations in the biotin-binding loop of the ligase active site. We believe that the role of the wing in the BirA enzymatic reaction is to orient the active site and thereby protect biotinoyl-5'-AMP from attack by solvent. This is the first evidence that the wing domain of a wHTH protein can play an important role in enzymatic activity."

Recoverin has two functional EF hands and a myristoylated N terminus. The myristoyl chain imparts cooperativity to the Ca2+-binding sites through an allosteric mechanism involving a conformational equilibrium between R and T states of the protein. Ca2+ binds preferentially to the R state; the myristoyl chain binds preferentially to the T state. In the absence of myristoylation, the R state predominates, and consequently, binding of Ca2+ to the non-myristoylated protein is not cooperative. We show here that a mutation, C39A, of a highly conserved Cys residue among NCS proteins, increases the apparent cooperativity for binding of Ca2+ to non-myristoylated recoverin. The binding data can be explained by an effect on the T/R equilibrium to favor the T state without affecting the intrinsic binding constants for the two Ca2+ sites.

Recoverin is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein family (9Ames J.B. Lim S. Molecular structure and target recognition of neuronal calcium sensor proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1820: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Like all members of the family, it is a small globular protein with four EF hand motifs and a post-translationally added fatty acyl group (myristoyl or related acyl chain) on the N-terminal glycine residue (Fig. 1A) (10Dizhoor A.M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R.S. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E. Zozulya S. Neubert T.A. Stryer L. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. The NH2 terminus of retinal recoverin is acylated by a small family of fatty acids.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16033-16036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two of the EF hands are non-functional in recoverin (Fig. 1B): EF1 as a result of the highly conserved CPXG sequence (residues 39–42) and EF4 as a result of a salt bridge between Lys-161 and Glu-171 (11Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Three-dimensional structure of recoverin, a calcium sensor in vision.Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Consequently, recoverin binds only two Ca2+ ions, one each at EF2 and EF3 (12Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.W. Ca2+-myristoyl switch in the neuronal calcium sensor recoverin requires different functions of Ca2+-binding sites.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50365-50372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The intrinsic affinities of the two sites for Ca2+ are different, but the binding is cooperative because Ca2+ and the myristoyl chain bind preferentially to two different conformations of the protein (R and T, respectively). The T state is a more compact structure than the R state and sequesters the myristoyl chain within a hydrophobic cavity of recoverin. The binding of two Ca2+ ions to recoverin results in the extrusion of the myristoyl chain from the protein interior into the aqueous milieu as recoverin changes from the T to the R state. This conformational transition is known as the “myristoyl switch” (13Zozulya S. Stryer L. Calcium-myristoyl protein switch.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 14Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L.

In the absence of the acyl chain, non-myristoylated recoverin exists predominantly in the R state, and binding is distinctly non-cooperative, with KD values reflecting the intrinsic affinities of the two sites for Ca2+ ions. Although recoverin clearly binds two Ca2+ ions (12Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.W.

In all structures of the Ca2+-bound form, only the high affinity EF3 site is occupied (11Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B.

We show here that mutation of the highly conserved Cys-39 (to alanine) within the CPXG motif of EF1 has a dramatic effect on the binding of Ca2+ to non-myristoylated recoverin. The mutation increases the apparent cooperativity for binding Ca2+ by a mechanism that is most parsimoniously interpreted as an effect on the T/R equilibrium to favor the T state without significantly affecting the intrinsic affinities of EF2 or EF3 for Ca2+. We also show from the x-ray crystal structure of wild-type (WT) recoverin under non-reducing conditions that Cys-39 can form a stable sulfenic acid. Cys-39 is the only cysteine residue in recoverin and has been suggested to function as a redox sensor in rod photoreceptor cells through formation of derivatives with higher oxidation states of the sulfur (i.e. sulfenic, sulfinic, or sulfonic acids) (17Permyakov S.E.

Cultures were grown with orbital shaking (220 rpm) to A660 ≈ 0.6–0.8 at 37 °C before inducing with 0.25 mm IPTG. Following incubation for an additional 3 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in Buffer A, and frozen at −80 °C. Recoverin was purified (19Desmeules P. Penney S.E.

Bound recoverin was eluted with a linear gradient of Buffer A to Buffer B, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Those fractions containing recoverin were combined and concentrated with a YM-10 Centricon to 1–2 ml and then dialyzed against Buffer C at 4 °C to remove EGTA.

Cells were grown to A660 ≈ 0.15 at 37 °C with orbital shaking at 220 rpm at which point sodium myristate was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm (19Desmeules P. Penney S.E. Salesse C.

Following a 30-min incubation period, the temperature was decreased to 27 °C, and expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm IPTG. Cells were harvested after 2 h, resuspended in Buffer C, and frozen at −80 °C until use in purification of recoverin. Bulk recoverin was purified using the low substituted phenyl-Sepharose matrix as described above, followed by chromatography on a Q-Sepharose FF matrix (GE Healthcare) using a KCl step gradient in a 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) to separate mRv from Rv; Rv elutes at ≈80 mm KCl, whereas mRv elutes between 100 and 120 mm KCl (20Ray S.

The purification of mRv was monitored by reverse-phase HPLC using a 0–80% acetonitrile gradient (in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) with a C18 analytical column (Advanced Chromatography Technologies, Aberdale, Scotland) on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Berkshire, UK). All mRv preparations used in this study were >95% myristoylated. Myristoylation of recoverin was also followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The LC-MS system consisted of an Agilent 1200 series HPLC connected to an Agilent series 6520 ESI Q-TOF. Protein samples (10 μm) dissolved in a 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid buffer were separated on a C18 Poroshell 300SB column (1 mm × 75 mm × 5 μm) at 0.5 ml min−1 using a linear gradient of 5–70% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. MS data were collected up to 3000 m/z, and raw spectra were deconvoluted using the maximum entropy algorithm of Agilent Masshunter version B.03.01 software. External mass calibration was performed using a mixture of purine (121 m/z) and HP-0921 (922 m/z) immediately prior to measuring protein samples. Cell pellets containing WT Rv were resuspended in Buffer D and sonicated to release the expressed protein. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and then passed over a Q-Sepharose FF matrix. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of Buffer D, and bound protein eluted with a linear gradient of Buffers D and E in 15 column volumes. Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing Rv were concentrated with a YM-10 Centricon and stored at 4 °C in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 for 1 month before crystallographic trials. RGS is a truncated form of RK in which the catalytic domain is replaced with a small linker peptide (i.e. GSGS) joining residues 1–181 to 512–557 of the kinase (these two regions form the RGS homology domain (22Singh P. Wang B. Maeda T. Palczewski K. Tesmer J.J. Structures of rhodopsin kinase in different ligand states reveal key elements involved in G protein-coupled receptor kinase activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14053-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)). RGS is soluble, is expressed well in E. coli, and can be purified by means of a C-terminal His6 tag. This tag was also used to immobilize RGS for binding assays. RGS was expressed from the pET28a vector in T7 Express E. coli cells. Cells were grown to A660 ≈ 0.6–0.8 at 37 °C with orbital shaking at 220 rpm before induction with 0.25 mm IPTG. Induced cultures were grown an additional 2–3 h before harvesting cells by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in Buffer F and frozen at −80 °C until purification. RGS was purified from thawed cell suspensions by sonication to break cells open, centrifuging to clarify the supernatant fraction, and applying the clarified lysate to a Ni-NTA matrix (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated with Buffer F. Bound RGS was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient using Buffers F and G. Purified protein was quantified spectrally using ϵ280 (33,640 m−1 cm−1) (21Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. How to measure and predict the molar absorption coefficient of a protein.Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar) and stored for up to 1 week at 4 °C. One liter of culture typically yielded 2–4 mg of purified RGS. Ca2+-binding assays were performed at 25 °C according to published protocols (14Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L.

Ca2+ standards were prepared by serial dilutions from a 0.1 m CaCl2 standard (Ricca Chemical Co.). Titration data were fit initially to one of two models: a model for cooperative interaction of the two Ca2+-binding sites and a non-cooperative model for two independent binding sites. In the cooperative model, data are fit to the Hill equation, f([Ca2+])=([Ca2+]n[Ca2+]n+Kdn)(Eq. 1) where f([Ca2+]) is the fraction of sites bound to Ca2+, [Ca2+] is the free Ca2+ concentration, Kd is the apparent dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient. In the non-cooperative model, the KD values (K1, K2) are fit as independent parameters, f([Ca2+])=0.5([Ca2+][Ca2+]+K1+[Ca2+][Ca2+]+K2)(Eq. 2) where K1 is the first dissociation constant, and K2 is the second dissociation constant. Data were also analyzed using Equation 3 f([Ca2+])=0.5(β[Ca2+]K1+2γ[Ca2+]2K1K21+L−1+β[Ca2+]K1+γ[Ca2+]2K1K2)(Eq. 3) for the concerted allosteric model shown in Scheme 1, where T refers to the conformation of the Ca2+-free protein (subscripts indicate the number a Ca2+ bound at each site), R the conformation of the Ca2+-bound protein, L is the T/R ratio, K1 and K2 are the same as in Equation 2, c is the ratio of Ca2+ affinity for the T and R states (0.003; assumed to be the same for both binding sites), β is equal to c + L−1, and γ is equal to c2 + L−1 (14Ames J.B.

Titration data were fit to (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3) using KaleidaGraph 4.1 from Synergy Software (Reading, PA). The formation of a complex between RGS and Rv was followed using a Ni-NTA matrix in a type of pulldown assay using spun columns. Typically, 10 nmol of purified RGS was first immobilized on the column. After removing unbound protein with Buffer H, recoverin was added in 1.5-fold molar excess over RGS. Following an incubation period of 30 min on ice, the column was washed again with Buffer H, and the recoverin-RGS complex eluted with 250 mm imidazole in Buffer H. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The KD for the recoverin-RGS interaction was measured using a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter (GE Healthcare) as described previously (6Ames J.B. Levay K. Wingard J.N. Lusin J.D. Slepak V.Z. Structural basis for calcium-induced inhibition of rhodopsin kinase by recoverin.J. Biol.

WT or C39A Rv was dialyzed against two changes of Buffer I at 4 °C and then loaded into the sample syringe at a concentration of 0.35–0.66 mm, to be used for titration of the RGS sample (30–60 μm). Initial crystallization trials used sitting drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C with Hampton sparse matrix crystallization screens (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). Protein was mixed 1:1 with crystallization mother liquor from a reservoir solution of 50 μl, and drops were set up using a Phoenix robot (Art Robbins Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). Once initial conditions were identified, subsequent exploration of crystallization space used the hanging drop method. Final crystallization conditions were: C39A, 2.0 m ammonium citrate (pH 7.0); WT, 1.8 m ammonium citrate (pH 7.0); oxWT, 1.8 m ammonium citrate (pH 7.0); and C39D, 2.4 m sodium malonate (pH 7.0). All samples contained 1–5 mm CaCl2. oxWT Rv was stored for 2–4 weeks at 4 °C in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 before use in crystallization trials. Crystals were soaked in reservoir solution containing 10% glycerol as cryoprotectant before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K with beam line 8.2.1 at the Advance Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA) using ADSC Q315R CCD detectors (Area Detector Systems Corporation, San Diego, CA). Data sets were integrated using MOSFLM (24Leslie A.G.W. Powell H.R. Read R.J. Sussman J.L. Evolving Methods for Macromolecular Crystallography.

As part of an ongoing effort to study the structure and function of recoverin, we explored a variety of approaches to fluorescently label the protein. Although the single cysteine residue Cys-39 has been labeled with a maleimide derivative of Alexa Fluor 647 (32Gensch T. Komolov K.E. Senin I.I. Philippov P.P. Koch K.W.

In this study, we investigated the implications of active site flexibility on the biochemical mechanism of TcTS. Molecular dynamics studies revealed remarkable plasticity in the TcTS catalytic site, demonstrating, for the first time, how donor substrate engagement with the enzyme induces an acceptor binding site in the catalytic pocket that was not previously captured in crystal structures. Furthermore, NMR data showed cooperative binding between donor and acceptor substrates, supporting theoretical results. In summary, our data put forward a coherent dynamic framework to understand how a glycosidase evolved its highly efficient trans-glycosidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1994194808,"Clustering analysis is an important tool in studying gene expression data. The Bayesian hierarchical clustering (BHC) algorithm can automatically infer the number of clusters and uses Bayesian model selection to improve clustering quality. In this paper, we present an extension of the BHC algorithm. Our Gaussian BHC (GBHC) algorithm represents data as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. It uses normal-gamma distribution as a conjugate prior on the mean and precision of each of the Gaussian components. We tested GBHC over 11 cancer and 3 synthetic datasets. The results on cancer datasets show that in sample clustering, GBHC on average produces a clustering partition that is more concordant with the ground truth than those obtained from other commonly used algorithms. Furthermore, GBHC frequently infers the number of clusters that is often close to the ground truth. In gene clustering, GBHC also produces a clustering partition that is more biologically plausible than several other state-of-the-art methods. This suggests GBHC as an alternative tool for studying gene expression data. The implementation of GBHC is available at https://sites.google.com/site/gaussianbhc/"
https://openalex.org/W2080599381,"Massive poly(ADP-ribose) formation by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) triggers NAD depletion and cell death. These events have been invariantly related to cellular energy failure due to ATP shortage. The latter occurs because of both ATP consumption for NAD resynthesis and impairment of mitochondrial ATP formation caused by an increase of the AMP/ADP ratio. ATP depletion is therefore thought to be an inevitable consequence of NAD loss and a hallmark of PARP-1 activation. Here, we challenge this scenario by showing that PARP-1 hyperactivation in cells cultured in the absence of glucose (Glu− cells) is followed by NAD depletion and an unexpected PARP-1 activity-dependent ATP increase. We found increased ADP content in resting Glu− cells, a condition that counteracts the increase of the AMP/ADP ratio during hyperpoly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and preserves mitochondrial coupling. We also show that the increase of ATP in Glu− cells is due to adenylate kinase activity, transforming AMP into ADP which, in turn, is converted into ATP by coupled mitochondria. Interestingly, PARP-1-dependent mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome complex (Cyt c) is reduced in Glu− cells, even though cell death eventually occurs. Overall, the present study identifies basal ADP content and adenylate kinase as key determinants of bioenergetics during PARP-1 hyperactivation and unequivocally demonstrates that ATP loss is not metabolically related to NAD depletion.

PARP-1, the oldest and best characterized member of the PARP family, is a nuclear enzyme converting NAD into polymers of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) that regulate chromatin-interacting proteins through steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion (2Schreiber V.

In keeping with the central role of the enzyme in cell demise, chemical inhibitors of PARP-1 exert widespread cytoprotection in disparate in vitro and in vivo disease models (12Jagtap P. Szabó C.

It has been proposed that intracellular NAD depletion and continuous resynthesis are the main triggers of necrotic cell death upon hyperactivation of PARP-1. This is because NAD resynthesis through the NAD rescue pathway is an ATP-dependent process that eventually leads to energy failure. This death route, the so-called “suicide hypothesis” (13Berger N.A. Poly(ADP-ribose) in the cellular response to DNA damage.Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), has been validated by numerous studies showing NAD and ATP depletion in cells undergoing DNA damage-dependent PARP-1 activation (6Chiarugi A. PARP-1: killer or conspirator? The suicide hypothesis revisited.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The suicide hypothesis, however, appeared too basic to explain the complex signaling pathways operating in cells undergoing hyper-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. In 2005, we reported that mitochondria readily sense nuclear PARP-1 activation, and failure of ATP formation occurs earlier in the organelles than in the cytosol (14Cipriani G. Rapizzi E. Vannacci A. Rizzuto R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 rapidly triggers mitochondrial dysfunction.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17227-17234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This information, on the one hand, provided the first hint that impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics is causal in energy failure by PARP-1, and on the other, that mechanisms leading to ATP loss during massive PAR formation are more complex than previously envisaged. In keeping with this, the suicide hypothesis has been recently complemented by the so called “Nudix hypothesis” (15Formentini L. Macchiarulo A. Cipriani G. Camaioni E. Rapizzi E. Pellicciari R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Poly(ADP-ribose) catabolism triggers AMP-dependent mitochondrial energy failure.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17668-17676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). According to this theory, hydrolysis of PAR into ADP-ribose monomers by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) and subsequent transformation of ADP-ribose into AMP by Nudix hydrolases (16McLennan A.G. The Nudix hydrolase superfamily.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) is the cause of energy collapse. In particular, failure of ATP synthesis occurs because AMP can fit the cytosolic binding ADP site of the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocator (ANT) with equal affinity to ADP but without sufficient energy to trigger mechanical rearrangement of the translocator and nucleotide internalization. This allows AMP, accumulated in large amounts because of rapid PAR degradation, to outcompete ADP binding, thereby precluding mitochondrial ADP entrance and ATP formation (15Formentini L. Macchiarulo A. Cipriani G. Camaioni E. Rapizzi E. Pellicciari R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Poly(ADP-ribose) catabolism triggers AMP-dependent mitochondrial energy failure.J. Biol.

Whether the Nudix hypothesis complements or replaces the suicide hypothesis is not known, and it is likely that the two death pathways, plus additional ones such as death signaling by PAR (17Andrabi S.A.

PARP-1 modulation of mTOR signaling in response to a DNA alkylating agent.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e47978Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), may play different roles in PARP-1-dependent cell death according to the specific cell type and/or stressor under investigation. Notwithstanding the mechanisms responsible for impairment of mitochondrial energy production, information currently available indicates that PARP-1 hyperactivity invariantly leads to cellular energy depletion. In the present study, to gather further insight into PARP-1 and energy dynamics, we investigated the role of glycolysis in cells undergoing hyper-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. We found that PARP-1 activation unexpectedly leads to a burst of energy production in cells acutely starved from glucose. HeLa cells or 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. Cultures were brought to 50–70% confluence and exposed to 100 μm MNNG and other drugs directly dissolved in the culture medium. For glucose deprivation, 10 min before MNNG exposure cells were washed twice with 1 ml of saline and exposed to DMEM containing 2 mm glutamine and 1 mm pyruvate but no glucose. Western blotting for PAR and for the cytosolic fraction of AIF and Cyt c, as well as immunocytochemistry were performed as described previously (19Rapizzi E. Pinton P. Szabadkai G. Wieckowski M.R. Vandecasteele G. Baird G. Tuft R.A. Fogarty K.E. Rizzuto R. Recombinant expression of the voltage-dependent anion channel enhances the transfer of Ca2+ microdomains to mitochondria.J.

The anti-PAR antibodies (10H) was from Alexis, the anti-AIF was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the anti-Cyt c was from BD Biosciences. Imaging was performed using a Nikon fluorescence microscope and a CCD camera. NAD contents were quantified by means of an enzymatic cycling procedure according to Ref. 14Cipriani G. Rapizzi E. Vannacci A. Rizzuto R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 rapidly triggers mitochondrial dysfunction.J. Biol.

In brief, cells grown in a 48-well plate were killed with 50 μl of 1 n HClO4 and then neutralized with an equal volume of 1 n KOH for NAD measurement. After the addition of 100 μl of 100 mm Bicine (pH 8), 100 μl of the cell extract was mixed with an equal volume of Bicine buffer containing 23 μl/ml ethanol, 0.17 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 0.57 mg/ml phenazine ethosulfate, and 10 μg of alcohol dehydrogenase. The mixture was kept at room temperature for 10 min, and then absorbance at 550 nm was measured. AMP and ADP were quantified in 0.25 n HCl cell extracts by HPLC using a Supelco 25-cm column (5 μm), 0.1 m mobile phase K2HPO4, 1% acetonitrile, 10 mm tetrabutylammonium bromide (pH 6.9), and UV detection at 260 nm. The cellular ATP content was measured by means of an ATPlite kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (14Cipriani G. Rapizzi E. Vannacci A. Rizzuto R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A.

Quantitation of oxygen consumption was conducted by means of the O xygraph system (Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, UK). Cells (250,000) were loaded in the chamber containing 400 μl of DMEM with or without glucose, and oxygen consumption monitored for 10 min at 37 °C. Adenylate kinase (AK) activity has been measured in cytosolic extracts of HeLa cells deprived of glucose for 30 min (to eliminate ATP formation by glycolysis) measuring ATP formation from ADP. The reaction mixture consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm NADP+, 2 mm glucose. The reaction was initiated by the addiction of 1 mm ADP and stopped within 2 min according to Ref. 21Brownson C. Spencer N.

The following primers were used: AK1, 5′-TGAGCGACGGATTGGACAGCCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTGCGCACAATGCCACGTTTCTC-3′ (antisense); AK2, 5′-TCGTTCCTACCACGAGGAGTTCAACCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATGCTTGCGAACACGACATCGG-3′ (antisense). Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was evaluated by means of flow cytometry. Cells seeded in 48-well plates were incubated with 2.5 nm TMRE in DMEM with or without glucose, exposed or not to 100 μm MNNG, and analyzed. Briefly, cells were detached with trypsin and then diluted in DMEM with or without glucose. After gentle pipetting, 200 μl of the cell suspension was further diluted with PBS and analyzed by the flow cytometer Coulter EPICS XL (Beckman Coulter) equipped with the EXPO32 Flow Cytometry ADC software (Beckman Coulter). 2.5 nm TMRE was present in all of the solutions used for cell preparation and measurement. Cell death was quantified by means of cytofluorometric analysis. Briefly, cells were detached with trypsin and EDTA, washed, resuspended in DMEM containing 3 μg/ml propidium iodide, incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and then analyzed by the flow cytometer Coulter EPICS XL equipped with the EXPO32 Flow Cytometry ADC software. Evaluation of significant differences among groups was performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey's w test. We first evaluated the effect of the glycolytic flux on depletion of NAD and ATP in cells undergoing PARP-1 hyperactivation. To this end, we exposed the highly glycolytic HeLa cells to the alkylating agent MNNG in culture media containing the mitochondrial energetic substrates glutamine and pyruvate in the presence or absence of glucose. It is well established that MNNG leads to NAD and ATP depletion as well as to cell death in a manner entirely dependent on PARP-1 hyperactivity (14Cipriani G. Rapizzi E. Vannacci A. Rizzuto R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 rapidly triggers mitochondrial dysfunction.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17227-17234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, 5 min after MNNG exposure, nuclear PAR accumulation was similar in cells exposed to a medium containing (Glu+ cells) or lacking (Glu− cells) glucose. When PAR contents were analyzed over time by Western blotting, we found that accumulation of polymers in Glu+ cells lasted up to 10 min after MNNG exposure, was highly reduced after 15 min, and completely disappeared at 30 min (Fig. 1B). This is consistent with prior work, indicating rapid degradation of PAR by PARG (15Formentini L. Macchiarulo A. Cipriani G. Camaioni E. Rapizzi E. Pellicciari R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A.

The same kinetic of PAR accumulation and degradation was detected in Glu− cells (Fig. 1B). In keeping with this, MNNG-triggered PARP-1-dependent NAD depletion was similar in Glu+ and Glu− cells (Fig. 1C). Unexpectedly, however, drastic differences were found when ATP depletion was analyzed. Specifically, whereas an almost complete loss of ATP content occurred 1 h after MNNG exposure and remained constant up to 5 h in Glu+ cells, a surprising and substantial ATP increase was found in Glu− cells exposed to MNNG. After this initial burst, ATP contents linearly decreased over time and reached control levels 4 h after PARP-1 activation. An abrupt reduction of energy levels occurred in Glu− cells 1 h later (Fig. 1D). Glucose deprivation also did not affect NAD depletion in mouse fibroblasts exposed to MNNG for 1 h. Similar to HeLa cells, however, in these cells ATP contents were reduced in the presence of glucose and increased in its absence (Fig. 1E). To ascertain that the ATP increase in MNNG-exposed Glu− cells was due to PARP-1 activity, we evaluated the effect of chemical inhibitors of the enzyme. Fig. 1F shows that PARP-1 inhibitors phenanthridinone and PJ34 rescued ATP loss in Glu+ cells and prevented ATP increase in Glu− cells. A large body of evidence indicates that PARP-1 hyperactivation impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics (10Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M.

We previously reported that, upon massive PAR formation, mitochondria undergo decoupling because of both cytosolic ADP shortage and ANT blockade (15Formentini L. Macchiarulo A. Cipriani G. Camaioni E. Rapizzi E. Pellicciari R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Poly(ADP-ribose) catabolism triggers AMP-dependent mitochondrial energy failure.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17668-17676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Consistent with mitochondrial uncoupling, an early increase of mitochondrial membrane potential takes place upon PARP-1 activation (14Cipriani G. Rapizzi E. Vannacci A. Rizzuto R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 rapidly triggers mitochondrial dysfunction.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17227-17234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). On this basis, we next evaluated whether mitochondrial derangement during hyper-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation also occurs in Glu− cells. Interestingly, in these cells we found that PARP-1 hyperactivation did not trigger mitochondrial hyperpolarization (Fig. 2, A and B). It is well appreciated that in conditions of ADP shortage mitochondria significantly reduce respiration. Accordingly, oxygen consumption in MNNG-exposed Glu+ cells was almost half of control values. In Glu− cells challenged with the alkylating agent, despite their increased ATP synthesis, respiration was also reduced, although to a lower extent than that occurring in Glu+ cells (Fig. 2C). Inhibition of PARP-1 by phenanthridinone almost completely prevented respiration reduction in Glu+ and Glu− cells (Fig. 2C). A key determinant of energy failure during PARP-1 activation is the relative ratio of cellular AMP/ADP concentrations (15Formentini L. Macchiarulo A. Cipriani G. Camaioni E. Rapizzi E. Pellicciari R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Poly(ADP-ribose) catabolism triggers AMP-dependent mitochondrial energy failure.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17668-17676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We therefore next compared ADP and AMP content in Glu+ and Glu− HeLa cells under control conditions or during MNNG exposure. We found that ADP content readily increased upon exposure of Glu+ cells to a fresh Glu− medium (Fig. 3A), in keeping with the net consumption of two ADP molecules by glycolysis. Also, upon MNNG exposure, ADP decreased and AMP increased in Glu+ but not in Glu− cells (Fig. 3, B and C). ADP depletion is in line with prior work (14Cipriani G. Rapizzi E. Vannacci A. Rizzuto R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 rapidly triggers mitochondrial dysfunction.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17227-17234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 15Formentini L. Macchiarulo A. Cipriani G. Camaioni E. Rapizzi E. Pellicciari R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Poly(ADP-ribose) catabolism triggers AMP-dependent mitochondrial energy failure.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17668-17676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Consistently, the AMP/ADP ratio in Glu+ cells exposed to MNNG was almost double than that occurring in Glu− cells (Fig. 3D). Overall, these findings indicate that the imbalance of ADP and AMP homeostasis, which is critical to energy failure in cells undergoing PARP-1 hyperactivity (15Formentini L. Macchiarulo A. Cipriani G. Camaioni E. Rapizzi E. Pellicciari R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Poly(ADP-ribose) catabolism triggers AMP-dependent mitochondrial energy failure.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17668-17676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), is dramatically reduced in the absence of glycolysis. Unaltered PAR degradation concomitant to lack of AMP increase in Glu− cells suggested that glucose deprivation conferred the ability to degrade the nucleotide. Key enzymes converting AMP back to ADP are AKs (27Dzeja P. Terzic A. Adenylate kinase and AMP signaling networks: metabolic monitoring, signal communication and body energy sensing.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2009; 10: 1729-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) that catalyze the AMP+ATP↔ADP+ADP reaction in a forward or reverse direction based on the relative concentrations of the nucleotides. AKs are key enzymes involved in intracellular AMP signaling and metabolic regulation (27Dzeja P. Terzic A. Adenylate kinase and AMP signaling networks: metabolic monitoring, signal communication and body energy sensing.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2009; 10: 1729-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We speculated, therefore, that AK activity prevents AMP increase in Glu− cells given their maintained ATP content during PARP-1 hyperactivation. We also reasoned that the involvement of AK could explain the paradoxical increase of ATP in these cells. Indeed, AK activity might allow the formation of an extra pool of ADP from AMP that, in turn, could be readily converted into ATP by coupled mitochondria. To corroborate this hypothesis, given that selective AK inhibitors are not available, we attempted to suppress cellular AK activity by silencing AK1 and AK2, the AK isoforms responsible for the majority of cellular AK activity. Remarkably, silencing of the enzymes (Fig. 3E) reduced cytosolic AK activity (Fig. 3F) and prevented the increase of ATP in Glu− cells exposed to MNNG (Fig. 3F). Notably, we found that MNNG exposure increased the adenylate pool of Glu− cells from 97 ± 12 to 120 ± 13 nmol/mg of protein, in keeping with the hypothesis of a net transformation of NAD into ATP via PARP→PARG→Nudix→AK. We also measured the mass action ratio of AK (i.e. [ATP]×[AMP]/[ADP]2) under the different conditions and found values of 0.7 ± 0.13 (Glu+ cells), 0.58 ± 0.16 (Glu+ cells plus 30 min of MNNG), 0.4 ± 0.19 (Glu− cells), 0.59 ± 0.09 (Glu− cells plus 30 min of MNNG). Evidence that all of these ratios are in the range of the equilibrium constant (from 0.44 to 0.77) (28Rose I.A. The state of magnesium in cells as estimated from the adenylate kinase equilibrium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1968; 61: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) indicates that the enzyme works close to equilibrium under the different conditions and, therefore, is not regulatory. We next wondered whether the remarkable difference in bioenergetics of cells undergoing hyper-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the presence or absence of glucose could affect execution of PARP-1-dependent cell death. It is well known that release of AIF from mitochondria readily occurs upon PARP-1 activation (29Wang Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Poly(ADP-ribose) signals to mitochondrial AIF: a key event in parthanatos.Exp. Neurol. 2009; 218: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial release of Cyt c also occurs in conditions of massive PAR formation (10Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Mediation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1-dependent cell death by apoptosis-inducing factor.Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar, 14Cipriani G. Rapizzi E. Vannacci A. Rizzuto R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 rapidly triggers mitochondrial dysfunction.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17227-17234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated by Western blotting the cytoplasmic levels of these two mitochondrial proteins in Glu+ and Glu− cells undergoing PARP-1 hyperactivation. Of note, we found that they accumulated to a lower extent in Glu− cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Accordingly, nuclear redistribution of mitochondrial AIF after MNNG exposure was less evident in Glu− than Glu+ cells (Fig. 4C). Importantly, when cell death was evaluated over time, we found that it was significantly delayed in Glu− cells. Their resistance to MNNG tended to reduce with time and disappeared 16 h after exposure to the alkylating agent (Fig. 4, D and E). For the first time, our study reports that massive PAR formation is not invariantly related to ATP depletion, and availability of glucose is a key determinant of PARP-1-dependent energy failure. This information significantly changes the scenario of the biochemical events responsible for loss of ATP in cells undergoing hyper-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Indeed, by showing that NAD loss is completely unaffected in Glu− cells despite a concomitant increase of ATP content, we demonstrate that NAD loss does not consequentially trigger ATP depletion. Rather, we propose that the key parameter that dictates energy failure is the AMP/ADP ratio present in the cytosol at the beginning of PAR degradation. Whereas our prior work demonstrates that the rate and extent of PAR degradation into AMP via Nudix hydrolases is a crucial element of the AMP/ADP ratio (15Formentini L. Macchiarulo A. Cipriani G. Camaioni E. Rapizzi E. Pellicciari R. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Poly(ADP-ribose) catabolism triggers AMP-dependent mitochondrial energy failure.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17668-17676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the present data indicate that glucose availability is an additional determinant of the ratio. We reason that although the Nudix pathway obviously regulates the numerator of the ratio, the presence of a glycolytic flux is a key determinant of the denominator. This is because in the absence of glucose ADP accumulates in the cytoplasm given that it is no longer converted into ATP through glycolysis. Accordingly, ADP contents promptly increase upon exposure to a medium lacking glucose (Fig. 3A). Increased ADP contents, in turn, competes with accumulating AMP on the ADP-binding site of ANT, thereby preventing failure of mitochondrial ADP/ATP exchange. Under these conditions, mitochondrial ATP extruded in the cytosol allows AK to transform AMP into ADP that can be readily converted into extra ATP in the mitochondria. In keeping with this interpretation, silencing of the main cellular AK isoforms AK1 and AK2 (27Dzeja P. Terzic A. Adenylate kinase and AMP signaling networks: metabolic monitoring, signal communication and body energy sensing.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2009; 10: 1729-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 30Panayiotou C. Solaroli N. Xu Y. Johansson M. Karlsson A.

J. 2011; 433: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) prevents the increase of ATP content above basal levels in Glu− cells undergoing PARP-1 activation (Fig. 3G). The present study therefore identifies cytoplasmic ADP contents during the first minutes of PAR degradation as the key determinant of PARP-1-dependent energy failure. An increase of ADP sufficient to outcompete AMP binding to the ANT from the very first phase of its accumulation warrants mitochondrial ATP production and ATP availability to AKs to convert AMP into ADP thereby preventing ANT failure and energy depletion. Of course, AKs do not play this role during PARP-1 activation in Glu+ cells because, despite massive AMP availability, ATP is lacking. Remarkably, the extremely rapid (within 5 min, Fig. 1B) PARG-dependent degradation of PAR causes an immediate burst of AMP accumulation that acutely alters adenine nucleotide homeostasis and renders even more critical the amount of ADP necessary to counteract the detrimental effect of accumulating AMP on ANT. Data showing that upon PAR degradation ADP content is lower than that of AMP in Glu+ cells but higher in those Glu− is in agreement with our hypothesis. Prior work also demonstrates that PAR can be a converted into ATP (31Maruta H. Matsumura N. Tanuma S. Role of (ADP-ribose)n catabolism in DNA repair.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Oei S.L. Ziegler M. ATP for the DNA ligation step in base excision repair is generated from poly(ADP-ribose).J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23234-23239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this is a different biochemical pathway in which ADP-ribose pyrophosphorylase transforms ADP-ribose and pyrophosphate into ATP that, in turn, assists DNA repair. We show here that ATP synthesis is maintained despite significant reduction of respiration in Glu− cells. This may be ascribed to the loss of cytosolic NAD pool with ensuing failure of the NADH-transhydrogenase shuttle that provides respiratory equivalents (i.e. NADH) to mitochondria. As an additional hypothesis, decrease of respiration might be due to PARP-1-dependent mitochondrial NAD depletion. This might occur either because of a possible existence of a mitochondrial PARP-1 or because of mitochondrial NAD efflux driven by reduced cytoplasmic content.

A recent contribution, however, is at odds with the hypothesis that mitochondrial NAD content changes during PARP-1 hyperactivity (20Alano C.C. Garnier P. Ying W. Higashi Y. Kauppinen T.M.

As a final note, reduced oxygen consumption in Glu− cells might be due to MNNG-dependent alkylation of respiratory complexes. Notwithstanding the underlying biochemical events, the fact that respiration diminishes to a lower extent in Glu− than in Glu+ cells and is paralleled by maintained mitochondrial coupling and ATP production suggests that it occurs through different mechanisms. A key finding of our study is that PARP-1-dependent AIF and Cyt c release is reduced in Glu− cells. Of note, this finding indicates that bioenergetic homeostasis of mitochondria affects release of mitochondrial death factors during hyper-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Also, data showing that cell death delay is lost 16 h after PARP-1 hyperactivation have important biochemical implications. Specifically, they suggest that the sole maintenance of ANT functioning is not sufficient to prevent PARP-1-dependent cell death. Indeed, AIF and Cyt c are released 3 h after PARP-1 activation even in Glu− cells that, at this time point, have unaltered ATP contents. Overall, data suggest that signals in addition to impairment of energy dynamic alter mitochondrial functioning during PARP-1-dependent cell death. Such signals may well be PAR polymer per se (29Wang Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Poly(ADP-ribose) signals to mitochondrial AIF: a key event in parthanatos.Exp. Neurol. 2009; 218: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The present study also has potential pathophysiological implications. For instance, the sensitivity to agents leading to PARP-1-dependent cell death should depend on the glycolytic rate of a given tissue. More specifically, it will be its metabolic milieu and the resulting cytoplasmic ADP content that will determine the rate and extent of bioenergetic failure that follows PARP-1 activation. In conclusion, data corroborate the relevance of the Nudix hypothesis to PARP-1-dependent energy depletion, identifying glycolytic flux, ADP availability, and AK as new players in the detrimental events that follow cellular hyper-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation."
https://openalex.org/W2105382358,"“Living stones” (Lithops spp.) display some of the most extreme morphological and physiological adaptations in the plant kingdom to tolerate the xeric environments in which they grow. The physiological mechanisms that optimise the photosynthetic processes of Lithops spp. while minimising transpirational water loss in both above- and below-ground tissues remain unclear. Our experiments have shown unique simultaneous high-light and shade-tolerant adaptations within individual leaves of Lithops aucampiae. Leaf windows on the upper surfaces of the plant allow sunlight to penetrate to photosynthetic tissues within while sunlight-blocking flavonoid accumulation limits incoming solar radiation and aids screening of harmful UV radiation. Increased concentration of chlorophyll a and greater chlorophyll a∶b in above-ground regions of leaves enable maximum photosynthetic use of incoming light, while inverted conical epidermal cells, increased chlorophyll b, and reduced chlorophyll a∶b ensure maximum absorption and use of low light levels within the below-ground region of the leaf. High NPQ capacity affords physiological flexibility under variable natural light conditions. Our findings demonstrate unprecedented physiological flexibility in a xerophyte and further our understanding of plant responses and adaptations to extreme environments."

Methods Ang II, NA, MMP-2, MMP-9 of the aorta sample obtained during operation from aortic dissection patients were detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography and ELISA and compared with controls. Isotope labelling method was used to test the impact of exogenous Ang II and noradrenaline on the NA release and MMP-2, MMP-9 expression on Sprague Dawley (SD) rat aorta rings in vitro. Two kidneys, one clip, models were replicated for further check of that impact in SD rats in vivo. Results The concentration of Ang II, MMP-2, 9 was increased and NA concentration was decreased in aorta samples from AD patients. Exogenous Ang II enhanced while exogenous NA restrained NA release from aortic sympathetic endings. The Ang II stimulated NA release and the following MMP-2 up-regulation could be weakened by Losartan and chemical sympathectomy. Beta blocker did not influence NA release but down-regulated MMP-2. Long term in vivo experiments confirmed that Ang II could enhance NA release and up-regulate MMP-2. Conclusions AD is initiated by MMP-2 overexpression as a result of increased NA release from sympathetic nervous endings in response to Ang II. This indicates an interaction of RAS and SAS during the formation of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2024113163,"Wax palms are an important element of the cloud forests in the tropical Andes. Despite heavy deforestation, the density of adults seems to be similar in deforested pastures as in forests. We aimed to infer the mechanisms responsible for this apparent resilience in pastures and we tested two hypotheses to explain it: 1) adult palms survived in pastures because they were spared from logging, and 2) adults occurred in pastures through the resilience of large juvenile rosettes, which survived through subterranean meristems and later developed into adults. For this purpose, we characterized the demographic structure of C. quindiuense in a total of 122 plots of 400 m2 in forests and pastures at two sites with contrasted land use histories in Colombia and Peru. Additionally, we implemented growth models that allowed us to estimate the age of individuals at four sites. These data were combined with information collected from local land managers in order to complete our knowledge on the land use history at each site. At two sites, the presence of old individuals up to 169 years and a wide age range evidenced that, at least, a portion of current adults in pastures were spared from logging at the time of deforestation. However, at the two other sites, the absence of older adults in pastures and the narrow age range of the populations indicated that individuals came exclusively from rosette resilience. These interpretations were consistent with the land use history of sites. In consequence, the combination of the two hypotheses (spared individuals and rosette resilience) explained patterns of C. quindiuense in pastures on a regional scale. Regeneration through subterranean meristems in palms is an important, yet overlooked mechanism of resilience, which occurs in a number of palm species and deserves being integrated in the conceptual framework of disturbance ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2045873122,"Immune suppression with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) is a well-established therapeutic concept for preventing host rejection of transplanted organs and graft versus host disease. Increasing the efficiency of rATG production by reducing the number of animals would be highly beneficial to lower cost and to improve quality standards. We have developed transgenic (Tg) mice and rabbits that overexpress the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and have shown an augmented humoral immune response in these animals. To test whether our FcRn Tg rabbits produced rATG more efficiently, we immunized them and their New Zealand White controls with live Jurkat cells. By day 21 after immunization, Tg animals produced significantly, 1.5 times higher amount of total IgG compared to their wt littermates. Also, the binding efficiency of Tg sera to Jurkat cells and their complement-mediated cytotoxicity was significantly higher. The purified Tg IgG preparation contained 2.6 the amount of Jurkat specific IgG as the wt preparation analyzed by complement-mediated lysis, suggesting greater antigen-specific B cell activation in the Tg rabbits. To test this hypothesis, immunization with ovalbumin and human α1-antitrypsin was performed, resulting in significantly greater numbers of antigen-specific B-cells in the FcRn Tg rabbits as compared with wt controls. The shift towards significantly larger populations of antigen-specific B cells relative to the non-specific B cell pool is further corroborated by our previous findings in FcRn Tg mice. Consequently, our FcRn Tg rabbits have the potential to offer substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements for the production of rATG and other polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies."

People who inject drugs (PWID) are at particular risk and nearly half (45%) of PWID in England may be infected. HCV prevention interventions have only had moderate impact on the prevalence of HCV in this population. Using qualitative methods, we sought to detail the protective practices potentially linked to HCV avoidance among PWID, and explore the motivations for these.The study used a life history approach allowing participants to detail their lived experience both before and during the course of their injecting careers. Thirty-seven participants were recruited from drug services in London, and from referrals within local injecting networks. A baseline and follow-up in-depth qualitative interview was carried out with each participant, and for half, a third interview was also undertaken. All underwent testing for HCV antibody. Analyses focused on developing a descriptive typology of protective practices potentially linked to HCV avoidance.Practices were deemed to be protective against HCV if they could be expected a priori to reduce the number of overall injections and/or the number of injections using shared injecting equipment. Participants reported engaging in various protective practices which fell into three categories identified through thematic analysis: principles about injecting, preparedness, and flexibility.All participants engaged in protective practices irrespective of serostatus. It is important to consider the relative importance of different motivations framing protective practices in order to formulate harm reduction interventions which appeal to the situated concerns of PWID, especially given that these protective practices may also help protect against HIV and other blood borne infections."

In this study, we report a novel phosphorylation site on Thr-118 of mouse Cbx7, which lies in close proximity to the Pc box. This site is highly conserved from Drosophila Pc to mammalian Cbx7, suggesting an important regulatory function. Here, we have developed a novel site-specific antibody to probe the function of Cbx7T118ph. We find that Cbx7T118ph is mediated by the MAPK pathway and is induced by serum and EGF. Furthermore, serum and EGF induced Cbx7T118ph can be blocked by MEK inhibitors. We also demonstrate MAPK-mediated Cbx7 phosphorylation in murine mammary carcinoma cells. Functionally, we demonstrate that upon stimuli such as EGF, multiple PRC1 members are phosphorylated, and PRC1 complex association is enhanced. Using an oncogene-induced senescence model, we find that H-RASV12 robustly induces Cbx7T118 phosphorylation, which in turn moderately enhances p16 repression and senescence bypass. This suggests that Cbx7T118 phosphorylation (and likely the phosphorylation of other PRC1 components) enhances the repressive ability of the PRC1. Collectively, we report a novel Cbx7 phosphorylation site and demonstrate that MAPK-mediated Cbx7T118ph regulates PRC1 function. Whole cell extracts from HEK 293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged mouse Cbx7 and parental HEK 293 cells were used for immunoprecipitation. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG resin beads (EZView red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel; Sigma). After immunoprecipitation, beads were washed in buffer containing 200 mm sodium chloride prior to MS analysis. For mouse ES cells expressing Cbx7-EGFP, GFP-trap beads (Chromotek) were used to precipitate GFP from ES cells expressing GFP or Cbx7-EGFP. Briefly, immunoprecipitated Cbx7 was digested and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using collision-activated dissociation.

HEK 293, murine mammary carcinoma (67NR, 168FARN, 4T07, and 4T1), and IMR90 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 1% of penicillin-streptomycin. Mouse ES cells LF2 and PGK12.1 were cultured as described previously (20O'Loghlen A. Muñoz-Cabello A.M. Gaspar-Maia A. Wu H.A. Banito A. Kunowska N. Racek T. Pemberton H.N. Beolchi P. Lavial F.

Serum induction (standard medium + 10% FBS) in HEK 293 cells began after 24 h of serum starvation (0% FBS). Recombinant human EGF stimulation (at 50 ng/ml; Peprotech; AF-100–15) in HEK 293 cells began after 24 h of serum starvation, and cells were harvested at various time points prior to 1 h. Chromatin fractionation was performed as described previously (4Bernstein E. Duncan E.M. Masui O. Gil J. Heard E. Allis C.D. Mouse polycomb proteins bind differentially to methylated histone H3 and RNA and are enriched in facultative heterochromatin.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2560-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation from the chromatin fraction, immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and protease inhibitors from Calbiochem; 539132) was added, and the cells were sonicated (Bioruptor; Diagenode). The insoluble fraction was cleared by centrifugation prior to immunoprecipitation. After anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation, elution was performed with 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma). Lambda phosphatase (NEB P0753S) was used to treat Cbx7 FLAG eluates as per the manufacturer's instructions, and phosphatase inhibition was performed by addition of phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Millipore; 524625–1SET). Constitutive active kinases (Millipore) used are as follows: ERK1 (14-439), ERK2 (14-550), p38α/SAPK2a (14-251), JNK2α2/SAPK1a (14-329), JNK3/SAPK1b (14-501), Aurora B (14-489), CDK1/Cyclin B (14-450), and CDK2/Cyclin E (14-475). Kinase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following kinase inhibitors were used in this study: SB203580 (Calbiochem), PD98059 (Calbiochem), U0126 (Promega), and Roscovitine (Cell Signaling). Prior to serum or recombinant human EGF induction, cells were treated with kinase inhibitor for 4 h, and the cells were harvested after 1 h of serum induction or 15 min for EGF stimulation. Kinase inhibitors were used at concentrations of 10 μm (SB203580 and U0126), 50 μm (PD98059), and 20 μm (Roscovitine). Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (4Bernstein E. Duncan E.M. Masui O. Gil J. Heard E. Allis C.D. Mouse polycomb proteins bind differentially to methylated histone H3 and RNA and are enriched in facultative heterochromatin.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2560-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed using the Zeiss, Axio Imager.Z1. Immunoblot images were quantified using ImageJ following the gel analyzer method outlined in ImageJ documentation. For each lane, PRC1 core components were normalized to total Cbx7. Cbx7 phosphorylation levels were calculated by the percentage of (area of densitometry peak from upper band)/(area of densitometry peaks of upper band and lower band) using anti-Cbx7 antibody. Oncogene-induced senescence was performed as described (38Barradas M. Anderton E. Acosta J.C. Li S. Banito A. Rodriguez-Niedenführ M. Maertens G. Banck M. Zhou M.M. Walsh M.J. Peters G. Gil J.

Briefly, IMR90 human diploid fibroblasts were sequentially transduced with a tamoxifen-inducible H-RASV12 and Cbx7 constructs. A final concentration of 10 nm 4-hydroxytamoxifen was used to induce senescence over a 2-week period. The cells were stained with crystal violet and assayed for p16 levels. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) followed by reverse transcription using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). PCRs were performed on a CFX384 real time system (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche Applied Science). All values were normalized to GAPDH and relative to the control using the ΔΔCT method. All quantitative PCRs were performed in quadruplicate. Primers for p16 and GAPDH were as described (20O'Loghlen A. Muñoz-Cabello A.M. Gaspar-Maia A. Wu H.A. Banito A. Kunowska N. Racek T.

To investigate the post-translational modification profile of Cbx7, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by LC-MS/MS using an established HEK 293 cell line that expresses C-terminal FLAG-tagged mouse Cbx7 (Cbx7-FLAG) (4Bernstein E. Duncan E.M. Masui O. Gil J. Heard E. Allis C.D. Mouse polycomb proteins bind differentially to methylated histone H3 and RNA and are enriched in facultative heterochromatin.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2560-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) versus the parental cell line as a control. Expressing mouse Cbx7 in HEK 293 cells reconstitutes a bona fide PRC1, because we detected core PRC1 proteins interacting with Cbx7 by MS: RING1A, RING1B, BMI1, and MEL-18, as well as less abundant components such as PHC3 and SCML2 (Fig. 1A) (39El Messaoudi-Aubert S.

In addition to canonical PRC1 components, we detected additional proteins, such as the RNA helicase Mov10, as we previously described (39El Messaoudi-Aubert S. Nicholls J. Maertens G.N. Brookes S.

By probing Cbx7 immunoprecipitates, as well as whole cell extracts of Cbx7-FLAG HEK 293 cells with both Cbx7 and FLAG antibodies, we noted a distinct higher molecular weight form of Cbx7 (Fig. 1B). This suggested a post-translationally modified form of Cbx7. The peptides recovered from MS analysis spanned the entire Cbx7 amino acid sequence, except for the initiating methionine, and revealed a novel phosphorylation site at threonine 118 (Cbx7T118ph) (Fig. 1C). Further analysis by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, which enriches for phosphopeptides, validated that Thr-118 was the only phosphorylation site present at detectable levels on mouse Cbx7 (data not shown). Of note, we did not detect any human-specific CBX7 peptides in this analysis, nor did we detect human CBX7 by immunoblotting of Cbx7-FLAG immunoprecipitates with multiple Cbx7 antibodies (data not shown). This is likely due to the low level of endogenous CBX7 in HEK 293 cells (17Bernard D. Martinez-Leal J.F. Rizzo S. Martinez D. Hudson D. Visakorpi T. Peters G. Carnero A. Beach D. Gil J. CBX7 controls the growth of normal and tumor-derived prostate cells by repressing the Ink4a/Arf locus.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5543-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The Thr-118 residue of mouse Cbx7 is highly conserved from fly to human and resides in a PX(S/T)P motif (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, a phosphorylated form of Drosophila Pc has been described in fly embryo extracts, but the direct site remains unknown (41Poux S. Melfi R. Pirrotta V. Establishment of Polycomb silencing requires a transient interaction between PC and ESC.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The Thr-118 residue lies in close proximity to the conserved Pc box (Fig. 2A), which is essential for Ring1a/b interaction (42Schoorlemmer J. Marcos-Gutiérrez C. Were F. Martínez R. García E. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Vidal M.

Intriguingly, several point mutations in this region were identified through sequencing of human tumor samples, including a proline to leucine mutation directly within the PX(S/T)P motif (Fig. 2A; data from cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, TCGA provisional) (43Cerami E.

https://openalex.org/W2066587860,"The use of naturalistic stimuli to probe sensory functions in the human brain is gaining increasing interest. Previous imaging studies examined brain activity associated with the processing of cinematographic material using both standard “condition-based” designs, as well as “computational” methods based on the extraction of time-varying features of the stimuli (e.g. motion). Here, we exploited both approaches to investigate the neural correlates of complex visual and auditory spatial signals in cinematography. In the first experiment, the participants watched a piece of a commercial movie presented in four blocked conditions: 3D vision with surround sounds (3D-Surround), 3D with monaural sound (3D-Mono), 2D-Surround, and 2D-Mono. In the second experiment, they watched two different segments of the movie both presented continuously in 3D-Surround. The blocked presentation served for standard condition-based analyses, while all datasets were submitted to computation-based analyses. The latter assessed where activity co-varied with visual disparity signals and the complexity of auditory multi-sources signals. The blocked analyses associated 3D viewing with the activation of the dorsal and lateral occipital cortex and superior parietal lobule, while the surround sounds activated the superior and middle temporal gyri (S/MTG). The computation-based analyses revealed the effects of absolute disparity in dorsal occipital and posterior parietal cortices and of disparity gradients in the posterior middle temporal gyrus plus the inferior frontal gyrus. The complexity of the surround sounds was associated with activity in specific sub-regions of S/MTG, even after accounting for changes of sound intensity. These results demonstrate that the processing of naturalistic audio-visual signals entails an extensive set of visual and auditory areas, and that computation-based analyses can track the contribution of complex spatial aspects characterizing such life-like stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2088689128,"RhoH is a hematopoietic-specific, GTPase-deficient member of the Rho GTPase family that was first identified as a hypermutable gene in human B lineage lymphomas. RhoH remains in a constitutively active state and thus its effects are regulated by expression levels or post-translational modifications. Similar to other small GTPases, intracellular localization of RhoH is dependent upon the conserved ""CAAX"" box and surrounding sequences within the carboxyl (C) terminus. However, RhoH also contains a unique C-terminal ""insert"" domain of yet undetermined function. RhoH serves as adaptor molecule in T cell receptor signaling and RhoH expression correlates with the unfavorable prognostic marker ZAP70 in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Disease progression is attenuated in a Rhoh(-/-) mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and treatment of primary human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with Lenalidomide results in reduced RhoH protein levels. Thus, RhoH is a potential therapeutic target in B cell malignancies. In the current studies, we demonstrate that deletion of the insert domain (LFSINE) results in significant cytoplasmic protein accumulation. Using inhibitors of degradation pathways, we show that LFSINE regulates lysosomal RhoH uptake and degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy. Whereas the C-terminal prenylation site is critical for ZAP70 interaction, subcellular localization and rescue of the Rhoh(-/-) T cell defect in vivo, the insert domain appears dispensable for these functions. Taken together, our findings suggest that the insert domain regulates protein stability and activity without otherwise affecting RhoH function."
https://openalex.org/W2018019709,"The inflammatory response is normally limited by mechanisms regulating its resolution. In the absence of resolution, inflammatory pathologies can emerge, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. We have been studying the D6 chemokine scavenging receptor, which played an indispensable role in the resolution phase of inflammatory responses and does so by facilitating removal of inflammatory CC chemokines. In D6-deficient mice, otherwise innocuous cutaneous inflammatory stimuli induce a grossly exaggerated inflammatory response that bears many similarities to human psoriasis. In the present study, we have used transcriptomic approaches to define the molecular make up of this response. The data presented highlight potential roles for a number of cytokines in initiating and maintaining the psoriasis-like pathology. Most compellingly, we provide data indicating a key role for the type I interferon pathway in the emergence of this pathology. Neutralizing antibodies to type I interferons are able to ameliorate the psoriasis-like pathology, confirming a role in its development. Comparison of transcriptional data generated from this mouse model with equivalent data obtained from human psoriasis further demonstrates the strong similarities between the experimental and clinical systems. As such, the transcriptional data obtained in this preclinical model provide insights into the cytokine network active in exaggerated inflammatory responses and offer an excellent tool to evaluate the efficacy of compounds designed to therapeutically interfere with inflammatory processes."
https://openalex.org/W2077698649,"It is widely agreed that complex diseases are typically caused by the joint effects of multiple instead of a single genetic variation. These genetic variations may show stronger effects when considered together than when considered individually, a phenomenon known as epistasis or multilocus interaction. In this work, we explore the applicability of information interaction to discover pairwise epistatic effects related with complex diseases. We start by showing that traditional approaches such as classification methods or greedy feature selection methods (such as the Fleuret method) do not perform well on this problem. We then compare our information interaction method with BEAM and SNPHarvester in artificial datasets simulating epistatic interactions and show that our method is more powerful to detect pairwise epistatic interactions than its competitors. We show results of the application of information interaction method to the WTCCC breast cancer dataset. Our results are validated using permutation tests. We were able to find 89 statistically significant pairwise interactions with a p-value lower than . Even though many recent algorithms have been designed to find epistasis with low marginals, we observed that all (except one) of the SNPs involved in statistically significant interactions have moderate or high marginals. We also report that the interactions found in this work were not present in gene-gene interaction network STRING."
https://openalex.org/W1978364504,"Chromatin-remodeling complexes are assembled around a catalytic subunit that contains a central ATPase domain and flanking sequences that recruit auxiliary subunits. The catalytic subunits of SWI/SNF remodelers recruit Arp7/9 through a helicase/SANT-associated (HSA) domain N-terminal to the ATPase domain. Arp7/9-containing remodelers also carry the auxiliary subunit Rtt102, but the role of this subunit is poorly understood. Here, we show that Rtt102 binds with nanomolar affinity to the Arp7/9 heterodimer and modulates its conformation and interactions with the ATPase subunit and nucleotide. When bound to Rtt102, Arp7/9 interacts with a shorter segment of the HSA domain. Structural analysis by small-angle x-ray scattering further shows that when bound to Rtt102, the complex of Arp7/9 with the catalytic subunit assumes a more stable compact conformation. We also found that Arp7, Arp9, and Arp7/9 interact very weakly with ATP, but Rtt102 promotes high-affinity ATP binding to a single site in the heterodimer. Collectively, the results establish a function for subunit Rtt102 as a stabilizing factor for the Arp7/9 heterodimer, enhancing its interaction with nucleotide and controlling the conformation of SWI/SNF remodelers in an Arp7/9-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1973058657,"To investigate the genetic and molecular regulation that the female gametophyte could exert over neighboring sporophytic regions of the ovule, we performed a quantitative comparison of global expression in wild-type and nozzle/sporocyteless (spl) ovules of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), using Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS). This comparison resulted in 1517 genes showing at least 3-fold increased expression in ovules lacking a female gametophyte, including those encoding 89 transcription factors, 50 kinases, 25 proteins containing a RNA-recognition motif (RRM), and 20 WD40 repeat proteins. We confirmed that eleven of these genes are either preferentially expressed or exclusive of spl ovules lacking a female gametophyte as compared to wild-type, and showed that six are also upregulated in determinant infertile1 (dif1), a meiotic mutant affected in a REC8-like cohesin that is also devoided of female gametophytes. The sporophytic misexpression of IOREMPTE, a WD40/transducin repeat gene that is preferentially expressed in the L1 layer of spl ovules, caused the arrest of female gametogenesis after differentiation of a functional megaspore. Our results show that in Arabidopsis, the sporophytic-gametophytic cross talk includes a negative regulation of the female gametophyte over specific genes that are detrimental for its growth and development, demonstrating its potential to exert a repressive control over neighboring regions in the ovule."
https://openalex.org/W1987687432,"The binding of the cdk inhibitor p21cip1 to Akt2 in the nucleus is an essential component in determining the specific role of Akt2 in the cell cycle arrest that precedes myogenic differentiation. Here, through a combination of biochemical and cell biology approaches, we have addressed the molecular basis of this binding. Using amino-terminal truncation of Akt2, we show that p21cip1 binds at the carboxy terminal of Akt2 since deletion of the first 400 amino acids did not affect the interaction between Akt2 and p21cip1. Pull down using carboxy terminal-truncated Akt2 protein revealed the importance of the region between amino acids 400 and 445 for the binding to p21cip1. Since Akt2_400–445 and Akt2_420–445 peptides could both bind p21cip1, this refines the binding domain on Akt2 between amino acids 420 and 445. In order to confirm these data in living cells, we developed a protocol to synchronize myoblasts at the cell cycle exit point when p21cip1 expression is induced by MyoD before myogenic differentiation. When a synthetic Akt2 peptide spanning the region (410–437) was microinjected in p21-expressing myoblasts, p21cip1 no longer localized exclusively in the nucleus, instead being redistributed throughout the cell, thus showing that injected peptide 410–437 acts to compete with the binding of endogenous Akt2 to p21cip1. Taken together, our data suggest that this 27 amino acid sequence on Akt2 is necessary and sufficient to bind p21cip1 both in vitro and in living cells."
