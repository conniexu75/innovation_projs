https://openalex.org/W1991625690,"Precursors of α-defensin peptides require activation for bactericidal activity. In mouse small intestine, matrilysin colocalized with α-defensins (cryptdins) in Paneth cell granules, and in vitro it cleaved the pro segment from cryptdin precursors. Matrilysin-deficient (MAT −/− ) mice lacked mature cryptdins and accumulated precursor molecules. Intestinal peptide preparations from MAT −/− mice had decreased antimicrobial activity. Orally administered bacteria survived in greater numbers and were more virulent in MAT −/− mice than in MAT +/+ mice. Thus, matrilysin functions in intestinal mucosal defense by regulating the activity of defensins, which may be a common role for this metalloproteinase in its numerous epithelial sites of expression."

https://openalex.org/W1942474822,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a cysteine-rich peptide synthesized and secreted by fibroblastic cells after activation with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) that acts as a downstream mediator of TGF-beta-induced fibroblast proliferation. We performed in vitro and in vivo studies to determine whether CTGF is also essential for TGF-beta-induced fibroblast collagen synthesis. In vitro studies with normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblasts demonstrated CTGF potently induces collagen synthesis and transfection with an antisense CTGF gene blocked TGF-beta stimulated collagen synthesis. Moreover, TGF-beta-induced collagen synthesis in both NRK and human foreskin fibroblasts was effectively blocked with specific anti-CTGF antibodies and by suppressing TGF-beta-induced CTGF gene expression by elevating intracellular cAMP levels with either membrane-permeable 8-Br-cAMP or an adenylyl cyclase activator, cholera toxin (CTX). cAMP also inhibited collagen synthesis induced by CTGF itself, in contrast to its previously reported lack of effect on CTGF-induced DNA synthesis. In animal assays, CTX injected intradermally in transgenic mice suppressed TGF-beta activation of a human CTGF promoter/lacZ reporter transgene. Both 8-Br-cAMP and CTX blocked TGF-beta-induced collagen deposition in a wound chamber model of fibrosis in rats. CTX also reduced dermal granulation tissue fibroblast population increases induced by TGF-beta in neonatal mice, but not increases induced by CTGF or TGF-beta combined with CTGF. Our data indicate that CTGF mediates TGF-beta-induced fibroblast collagen synthesis and that in vivo blockade of CTGF synthesis or action reduces TGF-beta-induced granulation tissue formation by inhibiting both collagen synthesis and fibroblast accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1606662847,"Good-genes hypotheses of sexual selection predict that offspring fathered by preferred males should have increased viability resulting from superior genetic quality. Several studies of birds have reported findings consistent with this prediction, but maternal effects are an important confounding variable. Those studies that have attempted to control for maternal effects have only considered differential maternal investment after egg laying. However, female birds differentially deposit testosterone in the eggs, and this influences the development of the chick. This study shows that female birds deposit higher amounts of testosterone and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone in their eggs when mated to more attractive males."
https://openalex.org/W1922502842,"The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1α), the ligand for the CXCR4 receptor, induces a wide variety of effects that include calcium mobilization, chemotactic responses, bone marrow myelopoiesis, neuronal patterning, and prevention of HIV-1 infection. Nonetheless, little is known of the biochemical pathways required to achieve this variety of responses triggered after receptor—chemokine interaction. We developed a set of monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize the CXCR4 receptor and used them to identify the signaling pathway activated after SDF-1α binding in human T cell lines. Here we demonstrate that SDF-1α activation promotes the physical association of Gαi with the CXCR4. Furthermore, within seconds of SDF-1α activation, the CXCR4 receptor becomes tyrosine phosphorylated through the activation and association with the receptor of JAK2 and JAK3 kinases. After SDF-1α binding, JAK2 and JAK3 associate with CXCR4 and are activated, probably by transphosphorylation, in a Gαi-independent manner. This activation enables the recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of several members of the STAT family of transcription factors. Finally, we have also observed SDF-1α-induced activation and association of the tyrosine phosphatase Shpl with the CXCR4 in a Gαi-dependent manner. As occurs with the cytokine receptors in response to cytokines, the CXCR4 undergoes receptor dimerization after SDF-1α binding and is a critical step in triggering biological responses. We present compelling evidence that the chemokines signal through mechanisms similar to those activated by cytokines.—Vila-Coro, A. J., Rodríguez-Frade, J. M., Martín de Ana, A., Moreno-Ortíz, M. C., Martínez-A., C., Mellado, M. The chemokine SDF-1 α triggers CXCR4 receptor dimerization and activates the JAK/STAT pathway. FASEB J. 13, 1699–1710 (1999)"

https://openalex.org/W2040204581,"Cdc13 and Est1 are single-strand telomeric DNA binding proteins that contribute to telomere replication in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here it is shown that fusion of Cdc13 to the telomerase-associated Est1 protein results in greatly elongated telomeres. Fusion proteins consisting of mutant versions of Cdc13 or Est1 confer similar telomere elongation, indicating that close physical proximity can bypass telomerase-defective mutations in either protein. Fusing Cdc13 directly to the catalytic core of telomerase allows stable telomere maintenance in the absence of Est1, consistent with a role for Est1 in mediating telomerase access. Telomere length homeostasis therefore is maintained in part by restricting access of telomerase to chromosome termini, but this limiting situation can be overcome by directly tethering telomerase to the telomere."
https://openalex.org/W1829187584,"It is often postulated that the cytoprotective nature of heme oxygenase (HO-1) explains the inducible nature of this enzyme. However, the mechanisms by which protection occurs are not verified by systematic evaluation of the physiological effects of HO. To explain how induction of HO-1 results in protection against oxygen toxicity, hamster fibroblasts (HA-1) were stably transfected with a tetracycline response plasmid containing the full-length rat HO-1 cDNA construct to allow for regulation of gene expression by varying concentrations of doxycycline (Dox). Transfected cells were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O(2)/5% CO2) for 24 h and several markers of oxidative injury were measured. With varying concentrations of Dox, HO activity was regulated between 3- and 17-fold. Despite cytoprotection with low (less than fivefold) HO activity, high levels of HO-1 expression (greater than 15-fold) were associated with significant oxygen cytotoxicity. Levels of non-heme reactive iron correlated with cellular injury in hyperoxia whereas lower levels of heme were associated with cytoprotection. Cellular levels of cyclic GMP and bilirubin were not significantly altered by modification of HO activity, precluding a substantial role for activation of guanylate cyclase by carbon monoxide or for accumulation of bile pigments in the physiological consequences of HO-1 overexpression. Inhibition of HO activity or chelation of cellular iron prior to hyperoxic exposure decreased reactive iron levels in the samples and significantly reduced oxygen toxicity. We conclude that there is a beneficial threshold of HO-1 overexpression related to the accumulation of reactive iron released in the degradation of heme. Therefore, despite the ready induction of HO-1 in oxidant stress, accumulation of reactive iron formed makes it unlikely that exaggerated expression of HO-1 is a cytoprotective response."

However, analysis of blood from hepatitis B virus carriers revealed the presence of smaller 22 nm particles consisting of a viral envelope surface protein. These particles are highly immunogenic and have been used in the design of hepatitis B virus vaccine produced in yeast. Upon expression in yeast, these proteins form virus-like particles that are used for parenteral immunization. Therefore, the DNA fragment encoding hepatitis B virus surface antigen was introduced into Agrobacterium tumerifacience LBA4404 and used to obtain transgenic lupin (Lupinus luteus L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) cv.

In addition, this moon's visually dark surface material, which spatially correlates with the sulfuric acid concentration, is identified as radiolytically altered sulfur polymers. Radiolysis of the surface by magnetospheric plasma bombardment continuously cycles sulfur between three forms: sulfuric acid, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur polymers, with sulfuric acid being about 50 times as abundant as the other forms. Enhanced sulfuric acid concentrations are found in Europa's geologically young terrains, suggesting that low-temperature, liquid sulfuric acid may influence geological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2098273775,"We have previously reported the identification of the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin, a specific inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesisin vivo. In our original studies, we demonstrated that a Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC-LM) primary tumor could suppress the growth of its metastases by generating angiostatin. Angiostatin, a 38-kDa internal fragment of plasminogen, was purified from the serum and urine of mice bearing LLC-LM, and its discovery provides the first proven mechanism for concomitant resistance (O'Reilly, M. S., Holmgren, L., Shing, Y., Chen, C., Rosenthal, R. A., Moses, M. A., Lane, W. S., Cao, Y., Sage, E. H., and Folkman, J. (1994)Cell 79, 315–328). Subsequently, we have shown that systemic administration of angiostatin can regress a wide variety of malignant tumors in vivo. However, at the time of our initial discovery of angiostatin, the source of the protein was unclear. We hypothesized that the tumor or stromal cells might produce an enzyme that could cleave plasminogen sequestered by the primary tumor into angiostatin. Alternatively, we speculated that the tumor cells might express angiostatin. By Northern analysis, however, we have found no evidence that the tumor cells express angiostatin or other fragments of plasminogen (data not shown). We now report that gelatinase A (matrix metalloproteinase-2), produced directly by the LLC-LM cells, is responsible for the production of angiostatin, which suppresses the growth of metastases in our original model.

However, none of these reports have identified the specific enzyme involved in the production of the biologically active angiostatin in the in vivo Lewis lung model in which angiostatin was first discovered nor have they demonstrated the production of angiostatin with identical sequence, composition, or biological activity to that which we first described. Here we present the first report of the production of biologically active angiostatin by tumor cells that correlates to the inhibition of tumor growth by tumor mass. LLC-LM lines were isolated from tumors growing in mice and were maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1% glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (1O'Reilly M.S.

Serum-free CM was prepared by washing nearly confluent cells with phosphate-buffered saline (3 washes) and then allowing them to condition the media composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 1% glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin for 24 h. Media were then collected, centrifuged, filtered (0.45 microns), and stored at 4 °C. Substrate gel electrophoresis was conducted according to a modification (9Braunhut S.J. Moses M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13472-13479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the method of Herronet al. (10Herron G.S. Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Gavrilovic J. Werb Z. J. Biol.

Briefly, Type I gelatin was added to the standard Laemmli acrylamide polymerization mixture at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Samples were then mixed with substrate sample buffer (10% SDS, 4% sucrose, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and loaded without boiling into wells of a 4% acrylamide Laemmli stacking gel on a mini-gel apparatus. Gels were run at approximately 15 mA/gel while stacking and at 20 mA/gel during the resolving phase at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the gels were soaked in 2.5% Triton X-100 with gentle shaking for 30 min at ambient temperature with one change of detergent solution. The gels were rinsed and incubated overnight at 37 °C in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, 5 mmCaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3). After incubation, gels were stained for 15–30 min in 0.5% Coomassie Blue R-250 in acetic acid:isopropyl alcohol:water (1:3:6), destained in acetic acid:isopropyl alcohol:water (1:3:6), and photographed.

Briefly, cells were plated onto gelatinized 24-well culture plates (12,500 cells/well) and were incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2 for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with 0.25 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% bovine calf serum, 1% antibiotics, and the test samples were added. After 20 min of incubation, media and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were added to each well to obtain a final volume of 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% bovine calf serum, 1% antibiotics, 1 ng/ml bFGF. After incubation for 72 h, media were aspirated, and the cells were removed by trypsinization, resuspended in Hematall, and counted electronically with a cell counter. Human plasminogen was purified from outdated human plasma and then incubated with 125 ml of LLC-CM obtained as above at 37 °C for 72 h or with native MMP-2 (8Fridman R. Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L.A. Berman M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15398-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation, test samples or control samples (serum-free control media not conditioned by cells but identically treated otherwise) were applied to a lysine-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column that had been equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The column was reequilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by phosphate-buffered saline until the baseline (A 280) was stable. Samples were fractionated by elution with 0.2 m aminocaproic acid as described previously (2O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Chen C.C. Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). All fractions eluted from the lysine affinity column, which contained protein as measured spectrophotometrically (A 280), were pooled, concentrated in a spin concentrator (4000 molecular weight cut-off, Gelman Scientific), and applied to a SynChropak RP-4 (100 × 4.6 mm) reverse phase HPLC column (Synchrom). Protein was eluted using a gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O to trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (CH3CN). Aliquots of each fraction were immediately concentrated by vacuum centrifugation, resuspended in H2O or phosphate-buffered saline, and tested for their ability to inhibit capillary EC proliferation stimulated by bFGF as described above. Fractions were also analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels followed by silver staining according to standard protocols. LLC-CM was preincubated with a polyclonal antibody raised against gelatinase A (anti-IVase), which has been shown to specifically block the proteolytic activity of MMP-2 (8Fridman R. Fuerst T.R.

This mixture was then incubated with whole plasminogen as described above. Controls included a sample of LLC-CM incubated with human plasminogen under the same conditions but in the absence of the neutralizing antisera. Following the incubation with human plasminogen, samples from each of the treatment groups were fractionated over a lysine affinity column, followed by reverse phase HPLC chromatography as described above. The 38-kDa protein obtained from LLC-LM CM processing was purified to homogeneity as described above, resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad), detected by Ponceau S staining, and excised from the membrane. The N-terminal sequence was determined by William S. Lane, Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA), using automated Edman degradation on a PE/ABD model 470A protein sequencer (Foster City, CA) operated with gas phase delivery of trifluoroacetic acid. Following our original method (1O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M.A. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J.

We have previously found that the in vivo phenotype of these cells can be changed after in vitro passage. To confirm that these cells would still form tumors that could suppress their metastases in vivo, they were injected into mice (1O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A.

The ability of these cells to form tumors that can suppress the growth of their metastases was confirmed in vivo (data not shown) as previously reported by us. Zymographic analysis of conditioned media of these LLC-LM cells revealed a prominent zone of clearance, which migrated at an apparent molecular mass of approximately 64 kDa, consistent with it being gelatinase A or MMP-2 (Fig. 1 A). Treatment with aminophenylmercuric acetate did not result in a decrease in molecular weight of this proteolytic activity (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that the Lewis lung carcinoma cells produce an active MMP-2 species. Immunoblot analysis using MMP-2-specific antibodies (Oncogene Sciences, Cambridge, MA) verified the identification of this proteolytic species as being gelatinase A (Fig. 1 B). A second immunoblot using the MMP-2-specific antibody, anti-IVase (8Fridman R. Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L.A. Berman M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol.

Treatment with 1,10-phenanthroline resulted in a total abrogation of proteolytic activity demonstrating that the 64-kDa enzyme was a metal-dependent protease (10Herron G.S. Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Gavrilovic J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2814-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Having demonstrated that LLC-LM cells produce gelatinase A, we next tested the ability of the conditioned media to process human plasminogen to angiostatin. Human plasminogen was prepared from outdated human plasma as described previously (2O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Chen C.C. Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Optimal processing of plasminogen into angiostatin was obtained by combining 1 mg of plasminogen with 125 ml of conditioned media. This mixture was incubated on a shaker at 37 °C for 72 h. Following incubation, test samples as well as control samples (serum-free control media not conditioned by cells but identically treated otherwise) were fractionated on a lysine-Sepharose column and eluted in a buffer containing 0.2 m aminocaproic acid (2O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Chen C.C. Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Bound material eluted as a single broad peak from the column. All fractions eluted from the lysine affinity column that contained protein as measured spectrophotometrically at A 280 were pooled, concentrated in a spin concentrator (4000 molecular weight cut-off), and applied to a SynChropak RP-4 (100 × 4.6 mm) reverse phase HPLC column. Protein was eluted using a gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O to trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (CH3CN) (Fig.2 A) as described previously (1O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C.

Aliquots of each fraction were immediately concentrated by vacuum centrifugation, resuspended in H2O, and tested for their ability to inhibit bovine capillary endothelial cell proliferation stimulated by bFGF in an in vitro endothelial cell proliferation bioassay. This is the same assay that has been used previously to characterize native and recombinant angiostatins. Inhibitory activity with comparable specific activity to that of the native angiostatin (IC50 = 200 ng) (Fig. 3) and eluted at a concentration of approximately 30% CH3CN, consistent with the pattern of elution that would be expected for native angiostatin (1O'Reilly M.S.

In contrast, comparable fractions from control media processed identically did not significantly inhibit EC proliferation. The inhibitory activity was electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and silver-stained according to standard protocols. A single band migrating at an apparentM r of 38,000 was observed, consistent with its identification as human angiostatin (Fig.4 A). As with angiostatin derived from the urine of tumor-bearing mice, the band migrated at 28 kDa when run under nonreducing conditions (data not shown).Figure 3Inhibition of capillary EC proliferation by gelatinase A-processed angiostatin.

Representative reverse phase HPLC chromatograms of LLC-LM CM following incubation without (Fig.2 A) and with (Fig. 2 B) gelatinase A-neutralizing antibodies are shown. SDS-PAGE analysis of these samples followed by silver staining verified the identification of a single band consistent with angiostatin (38 kDa, Fig. 4 A) detected in the CM samples incubated in the absence of neutralizing antibody. In contrast, angiostatin is absent, and a band corresponding to intact plasminogen is prominent in the CM of samples, which were incubated in the presence of the neutralizing gelatinase A antibody (Fig. 4 A). Gelatinase A digestion of plasminogen generated angiostatin as a single 38-kDa peptide identical to that seen after incubation of plasminogen with the conditioned media of Lewis lung carcinoma. This is in contrast to previous reports of multiple bands with angiostatin activity seen with the digestion of plasminogen (3Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Patrick M. Boggio L.

Upon assay of the fractions containing protein from both of these columns for their ability to inhibit capillary EC proliferation, we found that only the fractions containing angiostatin inhibited EC proliferation. We did not detect any significant antiproliferative activity in any of the other fractions tested. Protein microsequencing of the inhibitory fraction identified this protein as human angiostatin (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, this microsequencing revealed an N terminus of residues 98–99, in comparison to that reported in the original angiostatin study (amino acid residues 97–98) (1O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M.A. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3180) Google Scholar). One explanation for this difference may be that the angiostatin reported in the original study was derived from murine plasminogen, whereas in the current report the angiostatin was derived using human plasminogen as a substrate. This shift in the N-terminal residue has been consistently observed in our studies of mouse and human angiostatin. C-terminal sequencing did not yield unequivocal C-terminal identity. Given that the “net” proteolytic activity is typically represented by a balance between enzyme and inhibitor activity, we have also tested the LLC-LM CM for tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases bioactivity using a solid radiolabeled collagen film assay (11Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R. Science. 1990; 248: 1408-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect significant inhibition of MMP activity in this assay using unconcentrated samples. Therefore, it would appear that, at the level of the LLC-LM tumor cell CM, the proteolytic balance is shifted in favor of the production of MMPs, in particular gelatinase A. These studies demonstrate that gelatinase A, in the same in vivo system in which angiostatin was first discovered, can process plasminogen into bioactive angiostatin. Although several other enzymes have been shown to process plasminogen to angiostatin, MMP-2 is the first enzyme that can produce angiostatin identical to that which we first described. Recent reports have documented that metalloproteinases can process precursor or parent proteins into their bioactive form. Metalloproteinases have now been implicated in the processing of the tumor necrosis factor-α precursor protein (12Gearing A.J.H. Beckett P. Christodoulou M. Churchill M. Clements J. Davidson A.H.

More recently, we have demonstrated that MMP-3 (stromelysin) can release soluble and active heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor from its membrane-anchored precursor (21Suzuki M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Fernandez C.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31730-31737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In light of the fact that MMPs have recently been shown to play a role in the processing of nontraditional MMP substrates, we focused on the role that MMPs might be playing in the processing of plasminogen into mature angiostatin. The production of angiostatin by gelatinase A from the tumor cells helps to resolve the question as to why a primary tumor might be producing angiostatin. By increased production of gelatinase A, the tumor may become more locally invasive. However, our findings clearly demonstrate that gelatinase A can also mobilize angiostatin. Therefore, the current study helps to explain the growth of the primary tumor, although the metastases are suppressed. In addition, the increased permeability of the tumor vessels may lead to the sequestration of circulating plasminogen into the neostroma of the tumor (22Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 146: 1029-1039Google Scholar). This plasminogen could then be cleaved into active angiostatin that then suppresses the growth of the metastases. Thus, the tumor microenvironment may localize the enzyme to the substrate resulting in the generation of angiostatin. Further evidence to support the role of enzymes in regulating angiogenesis comes from the emerging theme that angiogenesis inhibitors are fragments of much larger proteins with distinct functions (23Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1997; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (6117) Google Scholar). For example, an internal 16-kDa fragment of prolactin inhibits angiogenesis, whereas the parent molecule, intact prolactin, does not (24Clapp C. Martial J.A. Guzman R.C. Rentier-Delrue F. Weiner R.I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1292-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).

We suggest that angiogenesis may depend not only upon the balance of endothelial stimulators and inhibitors but also upon the balance of matrix-degrading proteases and their endogenous inhibitors. The regulation of angiogenesis by MMPs suggests that clinical strategies that decrease the enzymatic activity of a tumor may also decrease the release of angiogenesis inhibitors. This possibility suggests that, with respect to the therapeutic use of MMP inhibitors, it will be important to define the precise role(s) of MMPs in the modulation of angiogenesis before utilizing therapeutic strategies that inhibit their activity."
https://openalex.org/W2043951259,"Ribozymes use a number of the same catalytic strategies as protein enzymes. However, general base catalysis by a ribozyme has not been demonstrated. In the hepatitis delta virus antigenomic ribozyme, imidazole buffer rescued activity of a mutant with a cytosine-76 (C76) to uracil substitution. In addition, a C76 to adenine substitution reduced the apparent pKa (where Ka is the acid constant) of the self-cleavage reaction by an amount consistent with differences in the pKa values of these two side chains. These results suggest that, in the wild-type ribozyme, C76 acts as a general base. This finding has implications for potential catalytic functions of conserved cytosines and adenines in other ribozymes and in ribonuclear proteins with enzymatic activity."

Individual DNA molecules were manipulated with an optical trap to examine the kinetics of torus formation induced by the binding of protamine and a subset of its DNA binding domain, Arg 6 . Condensation and decondensation experiments with λ-phage DNA show that toroid formation and stability are influenced by the number of arginine-rich anchoring domains in protamine. The results explain why protamines contain so much arginine and suggest that these proteins must be actively removed from sperm chromatin after fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W1553845687,"Tissue transglutaminase (TG) is an enzyme that stabilizes the structure of tissues by covalently ligating extracellular matrix molecules. Expression and localization of TG are not well established during wound healing. We performed punch biopsy wounds on anesthetized rats and monitored the wound healing process by histological and immunohistochemical methods. The TG antigen and activity are expressed at sites of neovascularization in the provisional fibrin matrix within 24 h of wounding. Endothelial cells, macrophages, and skeletal muscle cells expressed TG throughout the healing process. The TG antigen within the wound was active in vivo based on the detection of isopeptide bonds. The TG antigen increased four- to fivefold by day 3 postwounding and was proteolytically degraded. TG expression occurred in association with TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and VEGF production in the wound. Recombinant TG increased vessel length density (a measure of angiogenesis) when applied topically in rat dorsal skin flap window chambers. We have established that TG is an important tissue stabilizing enzyme that is active during wound healing and can function to promote angiogenesis."

This phenomenon increases the damage tolerance of ceramics and will allow engineers to design reliable ceramic components for structural applications. The stress intensity factor derived for a crack sandwiched between two compressive layers suggests that the threshold strength is proportional to the residual compressive stress and the thickness of the compressive layer and is inversely proportional to the distance between the compressive layers. Laminates composed of thick alumina layers (605 +/- 11 micrometers) and thin mullite/alumina compressive layers (37 +/- 1.4 micrometers) fabricated for this study had a threshold strength of 482 +/- 20 megapascals, in fair agreement with the theory."

CdCl2 (5 μM) increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as determined by oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 to fluorescent rhodamine 123. The levels of ubiq-uitin-conjugated cellular proteins were increased by Cd in a time-dependent fashion (maximum at 24–48 h). This was prevented by coincubation with the thiol antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 15 mM). Cd also increased apoptosis (controls: 2.4±1.6%; Cd: 8.1±1.9%), but not necrosis (controls: 0.5 ± 0.3%; Cd: 1.4± 2.5%). Exposure of PT cells with Cd decreased protein levels of the catalytic subunit (α1) of Na+/ K+-ATPase, a long-lived membrane protein (t1/2 <48 h) that drives reabsorption of ions and nutrients through Na+-dependent transporters in PT. Incubation of PT cells for 48 h with Cd decreased Na+/ K+-ATPase α1-subunit, as determined by immuno-blotting, by ≈50%, and NAC largely prevented this effect. Inhibitors of the proteasome such as MG-132 (20 μM) or lactacystin (10 μM), as well as lysosomo-tropic weak bases such as chloroquine (0.2 mM) or NH4Cl (30 mM), significantly reduced the decrease of Na+/K+-ATPase α1-subunit induced by Cd, and in combination abolished the effect of Cd on Na+/ K+-ATPase. Immunofluorescence labeling of Na+/ K+-ATPase showed a reduced expression of the protein in the plasma membrane of Cd-exposed cells. After addition of lactacystin and chloroquine to Cd-exposed PT cells, immunoreactive material accumulated into intracellular vesicles. The data indicate that micromolar concentrations of Cd can increase ROS production and exert a toxic effect on PT cells. Oxidative damage increases the degradation of Na+/K+-ATPase through both the proteasomal and endo-/lysosomal proteolytic pathways. Degradation of oxidatively damaged Na+/K+-ATPase may contribute to the ‘Fanconi syndrome’-like Na+-depen-dent transport defects associated with Cd-nephrotox-icity.—Thévenod, F., Friedmann, J. M.

We have recently reported that the transforming growth factor-β pathway-specific Smad3 and Smad4 proteins transactivate the human p21 promoter via a short proximal region, which contains multiple binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1. In the present study we show that the Sp1-occupied promoter region mediates transactivation of the p21 promoter by c-Jun and the related proteins JunB, JunD, and ATF-2. By using gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays we show that this region does not contain a binding site for c-Jun. In accordance with the DNA binding data, c-Jun was unable to transactivate the p21 promoter when overexpressed in the Sp1-deficientDrosophila-derived SL2 cells. Coexpression of c-Jun and Sp1 in these cells resulted in a strong synergistic transactivation of this promoter. In addition, a chimeric promoter consisting of six tandem high affinity Sp1-binding sites fused with the CAT gene was transactivated by overexpressed c-Jun in HepG2 cells. The above data propose functional cooperation between c-Jun and Sp1. Physical interactions between the two factors were demonstrated in vitro by using GST-Sp1 hybrid proteins expressed in bacteria andin vitro transcribed-translated c-Jun. The region of c-Jun mediating interaction with Sp1 was mapped within the basic region leucine zipper domain. In vivo, functional interactions between c-Jun and Sp1 were demonstrated using a GAL4-based transactivation assay. Overexpressed c-Jun transactivated a chimeric promoter consisting of five tandem GAL4-binding sites only when coexpressed with GAL4-Sp1-(83–778) fusion proteins in HepG2 cells. By utilizing the same assay, we found that the glutamine-rich segment of the B domain of Sp1 (Bc, amino acids 424–542) was sufficient for c-Jun-induced transactivation of the p21 promoter. In conclusion, our data support a mechanism of superactivation of Sp1 by c-Jun, which is based on physical and functional interactions between these two transcription factors on the human p21 and possibly other Sp1-dependent promoters.

Sp1 belongs to a zinc finger family of transcription factors that recognize GC-rich DNA sequences (27Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11109-11110Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28Lania L. Majello B. De Luca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Sp1 plays an important role in early embryonic development and seems to be required for the maintenance of terminal cell differentiation by regulating the state of DNA CpG island methylation (29Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The DNA binding and transactivation activities of Sp1 are regulated by phosphorylation that follows cell cycle-specific patterns (30Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.-Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Sp1 protein is also stabilized byO-linked glycosylation, which confers resistance to proteasome-dependent degradation (31Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Sp1 has been shown to associate directly with members of the basal transcription machinery such as TFIID components (32Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 33Saluja D. Vassallo M.F. Tanese N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5734-5743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Sp1 physically interacts and functionally cooperates with several transcriptional activators including NF-κB, GATA, YY1, E2F1, pRb, SREBP-1 (34Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6145-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 35Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Avizonis D. Scheek S. Zwicker J. Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, although Sp1 has been traditionally considered as a ubiquitous factor closely associated with core promoter activities, it has been recently shown to participate in several cases of regulated gene transcription by multiple signaling pathways and metabolic or differentiation conditions. Detailed analysis of Sp1-mediated up-regulation of p21 has been provided for the action of TGF-β (21Datto M.B., Yu, Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 23Li J.M. Datto M.B. Shen X. Hu P.P., Yu, Y. Wang X.-F.

A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The cellular effects of TGF-β are elucidated by a signaling pathway that involves membrane serine/threonine kinase receptors and cytoplasmic effectors of which the best understood are the Smad proteins (24Hunt K.K. Fleming J.B. Abramian A. Zhang L. Evans D.B. Chiao P.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5656-5661PubMed Google Scholar, 25Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the other hand, one of the earliest genomic responses of cells to TGF-β is the induction of Jun family members (40Pertovaara L. Sistonen L. Bos T.J. Vogt P.K. Keski-Oja J. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 41Li L. Hu J.-S. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1556-1562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Jun proteins, as constituents of the AP-1 transcriptional complex, also activate several major target genes of TGF-β signaling, including plasminogen activator inhibitor I, pro-α1(I)-collagen, retinoic acid receptors, interleukin 11, and c-jun itself among others (Ref. 42Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.M. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar and references therein). The role of Jun transcription factors in TGF-β-regulated gene expression is additionally underscored by the recent identification of specific c-Jun/Smad protein-protein interactions and functional cooperation (43Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 44Liberati N.T. Shen X. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the mechanism of p21 gene induction by TGF-β in hepatoma HepG2 cells is based on functional interactions between Smad3 and -4 proteins and Sp1 (25Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We now report that Jun family members can also regulate p21 promoter activity in the same cell system. We demonstrate that c-Jun physically interacts with Sp1 and superactivates p21 promoter activity in a manner that does not require direct binding of c-Jun to the proximal p21 promoter. This newly uncovered mechanism underlying the action of Jun proteins provides a second pathway that could explain TGF-β-mediated p21 up-regulation and could furthermore explain p21 induction by various other stress or pro-inflammatory factors.

Expression of proteinsin vitro was performed using the coupled in vitrotranscription/translation system (TNT) of Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeling of in vitro expressed proteins was done by the inclusion of 20 μCi of [35S]methionine in the TNT reaction mixture. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells, monkey kidney COS-1 cells, human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, and mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2atmosphere. Drosophila Schneider's SL2 cells were cultured in Schneider's insect medium supplemented with 10% insect culture-tested fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 25 °C. Transient transfections were performed using the Ca3(PO4)2 coprecipitation method (46Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (; Correction (1992) J. Biol. Chem.267, 7956): 2622-2632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (46Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (; Correction (1992) J. Biol. Chem.267, 7956): 2622-2632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (46Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (; Correction (1992) J. Biol.

Oligonucleotides corresponding to the p21 promoter regions were synthesized, made double-stranded, labeled with Klenow and [α-32P]dCTP, and incubated with purified proteins. The sequence of the oligonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments are as follows: (a) p21 (−122/−84), 5′-GGAGGGCGGTCCCGGGCGGCGCGGTGGGCCGAGCGCGGG-3′; (b) p21 (−88/−120), 5′-CCCGCGCTCGGCCCACCGCGCCGCCCGGGACCGCCCTCCC-3′; (c) p21 (−86/−70), 5′-GGGTCCCGCCTCCTTGA-3′; and (d) p21 (−70/−86), 5′-TCAAGGAGGCGGGACC-3′. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH-10β. Bacteria were grown overnight, diluted 1:25, and after reaching anA 600 of 0.7, were stimulated with 250 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were then harvested, resuspended in 0.03 volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sonicated for 1 min in PBS on ice, lysed by the addition of Triton X-100 to final concentration of 1%, and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, at 4 °C for 10 min, resulting in a first supernatant enriched in GST fusion protein. The pellets were redissolved in solubilization buffer (1 mmEDTA, 25 mm triethanolamine, 1.5%N-laurylsarcosine) for 30 min, at 4 °C, with gentle agitation. Triton X-100 to final concentration of 2% and CaCl2 to final concentration of 1 mm were added, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, at 4 °C, for 10 min, resulting to a second supernatant also enriched in GST fusion proteins. Both supernatants were used for the GST protein-protein interaction experiments. The solubilization of the expressed proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were equilibrated in PBS and mixed with 1 volume of bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins on a rotary shaker for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 10 volumes of PBS and equilibrated in washing buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Fifty microliters of a 1:1 bead slurry in washing buffer was combined with 5 μl of a 35S-labeled reticulocyte lysate in a final volume of 500 μl of washing buffer, 10% glycerol (Interaction buffer) on a rotary shaker for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 5 times with 20 volumes of washing buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli SDS-PAGE loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The proximal region of the human p21 promoter extending between positions −122 and −64 is GC-rich and contains five sequences that resemble or match exactly the recognition sequence of the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 (5′-GGGCGG-3′, Fig. 1 A, double underline). One of these Sp1 sites was shown previously to be required for the stimulation of the p21 promoter by TGF-β in HaCaT keratinocytes (designated TβRE in Fig. 1 A) (21Datto M.B., Yu, Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), whereas at least one of these Sp1 sites was shown to mediate stimulation of the same promoter by phorbol esters (designated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in Fig. 1 A) during U937 cell differentiation (18Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Since both TGF-β and phorbol ester signal transduction pathways are mediated, at least in part, by AP1 proteins (Jun and ATF-2), we investigated the role of different AP1 family members in human p21 gene regulation. For this purpose, reporter constructs containing different p21 promoter fragments (−2300/+8, −210/+8, and −143/+8) fused with the bacterial CAT reporter gene were transiently cotransfected into the human hepatoma HepG2 cells along with an expression vector for the protooncogene c-jun or the empty vector as a control. As shown in Fig. 1 B, overexpression of rat c-Jun in HepG2 cells resulted in a 1.4–7-fold transactivation depending on the p21 promoter fragment tested. The greatest induction of transactivation by c-Jun was achieved with a short proximal promoter that extends 143 bases 5′ and 8 bases 3′ to the transcription initiation site of the p21 gene (−143/+8 p21 CAT). Transactivation of the −143/+8 p21 promoter by c-Jun was dose-dependent and was also observed in non-hepatic cell lines such as the human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and the mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cells to levels comparable to the ones achieved in HepG2 cells (data not shown). These findings suggest that the transactivation of the p21 promoter by c-Jun does not depend on hepatocyte-specific auxiliary factors. To investigate further the contribution of the proximal GC-rich −122/−64 p21 promoter region to the c-Jun-mediated transactivation, HepG2 cells were transiently cotransfected with the −2300/+8 p21 promoter-luciferase construct bearing an internal deletion between nucleotides −122 and −64 (−2300/+8 (Δ−122/−64) p21 luciferase) along with the expression vector for rat c-Jun or the empty vector as a control. As shown in Fig. 1 B, this mutated promoter was only 5% as active as the wt promoter and was not responsive to c-Jun overexpression in HepG2 cells. This finding confirms the importance of this proximal 60-base pair region for the c-Jun-mediated transactivation of the p21 promoter in hepatocytes. To investigate the ability of other members of the AP1 family of transcription factors (JunB, JunD, and ATF-2) to transactivate the p21 promoter, HepG2 cells were transiently cotransfected with the −143/+8 p21 CAT reporter construct along with expression vectors for the mouse JunB and JunD and the human ATF-2 proteins. As shown in Fig.1 C, overexpression of JunB, JunD, or ATF-2 caused a 5.8-, 6.2-, and 1.6-fold transactivation of the −143/+8 p21 promoter, respectively. No statistically significant change in transactivation was observed when the above three proteins wer"

Immediately after treatment, acuity was no better than that of normal newborns. Acuity improved significantly over the next month, with some improvement apparent after as little as 1 hour of visual input. Unlike findings at older ages, the pattern of results was the same for eyes treated for monocular and for binocular deprivation. The results indicate that patterned visual input is necessary for the postnatal improvement of human visual acuity and that the onset of such input initiates rapid functional development."

Here the alpha2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan was administered to rats alone or in combination with the D2/3 dopamine receptor antagonist raclopride. Dopamine efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex and conditioned avoidance responding were analyzed. Idazoxan selectively potentiated the cortical output of dopamine and augmented the suppression of conditioned avoidance responding induced by raclopride. These results challenge basic assumptions underlying the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia and provide insight into clozapine's mode of action.

The Rb-Sr and Pb-Pb isochrons are defined by leachates of a mixture of high-graded carbonate (visually estimated as ∼5 percent), whitlockite (trace), and orthopyroxene (∼95 percent). The carbonate formation age is contemporaneous with a period in martian history when the surface is thought to have had flowing water, but also was undergoing heavy bombardment by meteorites. Therefore, this age does not distinguish between aqueous and impact origins for the carbonates."

Expression of the nitric oxide synthases is altered in the retinal vascu-lature in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. We analyzed the allele distribution of a polymorphic pentanucleotide repeat within the 5′ upstream promoter region of the NOS2A gene in samples of diabetic patients. In diabetic patients from Northern Ireland, the 14-repeat allele of the NOS2A marker was significantly associated with the absence of diabetic retinopathy. Carriers of this repeat had 0.21-fold the relative risk of developing diabetic retinopathy than noncarriers of this allele. They also had significantly fewer renal and cardiovascular complications. The ability of differing numbers of (CCTTT)n pentanucleotide repeats to induce transcription of the NOS2A gene was analyzed using a luciferase reporter gene assay in transfected colonic carcinoma cells. Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) induction was most effective in constructs carrying the 14-repeat allele. When cells were incubated in 25 mM glucose to mimic the diabetic state, IL-1 β induction was inhibited in all cases, but to a significantly lesser extent with the 14-repeat allele. These unique properties of the 14-repeat allele may confer selective advantages in diabetic individuals, which may delay or prevent microvascular complications of diabetes.—Warpeha, K.

https://openalex.org/W1527997106,"Theendothelial cell inhibitor endostatin (22 kDa) is part of the carboxyl-terminal globular domain of collagen XVIII and shows a widespread tissue distribution. Immunohistology of adult mouse tissues demonstrated a preferred localization in many vessel walls and some other basement membrane zones. A strong immunogold staining was observed across elastic fibers in the multiple elastic membranes of aorta and other large arteries. Staining was less strong along sparse elastic fibers of veins and almost none was observed in the walls of arterioles and capillaries. Strong evidence was also obtained for some intracellular and basement membrane associations. Immunogold double staining of elastic fibers showed a close colocalization of endostatin with fibulin-2, fibulin-1, and nidogen-2, but not with perlecan. Reasonable amounts of endostatin could be extracted from aorta and skin by EDTA, followed by detergents, with aorta being the richest source of the inhibitor identified so far. Solubilizations with collagenase and elastase were approximately fivefold less efficient. Immunoblots of aortic extracts detected major endostatin components of 22-25 kDa whereas skin extracts also contained some larger components. Solid-phase assays demonstrated distinct binding of recombinant mouse endostatin to the fibulins and nidogen-2, consistent with their tissue colocalization. Together, the data indicate several different ways for endostatin to be associated with the extracellular matrix, and its release may determine biological activation. This also defines a novel function for some elastic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1936765564,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the destruction of pancreatic beta cells and the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). However, the cellular mechanism responsible for beta cell death is still unclear. We hypothesize that activation of NFkappaB by ROS is the key cellular signal in initiating a cascade of events leading to beta cell death. Thus, enhancement of pancreatic GSH, a known antioxidant and key regulator of NF-kappaB, should protect against IDDM. Weanling CD1 mice (n=5) were injected with alloxan (50 mg/kg i.v.) to induce IDDM. Using EPR spin trapping techniques, we demonstrated that alloxan generated ROS in the pancreas 15 min after administration. Activation of NFkappaB in pancreatic nuclear extracts was observed 30 min after alloxan injection, as assessed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Fasting blood glucose levels were monitored for 14 days. Supplementation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 500 mg/kg), a GSH precursor, inhibited alloxan-induced NFkappaB activation and reduced hyperglycemia. Thus, NFkappaB activation by ROS may initiate a sequence of events leading to IDDM. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by NAC attenuated the severity of IDDM. This research will contribute to the understanding of the etiology of IDDM and may lead to the development of better strategies for disease prevention."

https://openalex.org/W2162102563,"The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that overexpression of glutathione reductase in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster increases resistance to oxidative stress and retards the aging process. Transgenic flies were generated by microinjection and subsequent mobilization of a P element construct containing the genomic glutathi-one reductase gene of Drosophila, with 4 kb upstream and 1.5 kb downstream of the coding region. Trans-genic animals stably overexpressed glutathione re-ductase by up to 100% throughout adult life and under continuous exposure to 100% oxygen or air. Under hyperoxic conditions, overexpressors had increased longevity, decreased accrual of protein car-bonyls, and dramatically increased survival rates after recovery from a semi-lethal dose of 100% oxygen. Under normoxic conditions, overexpression of glutathione reductase had no effect on longevity, protein carbonyl content, reduced glutathione, or glutathione disulfide content, although the total consumption of oxygen was slightly decreased. Glutathi-one reductase activity does not appear to be a rate-limiting factor in anti-aging defenses under nor-moxic conditions, but it may become a limiting factor when the level of oxidative stress is elevat-ed.—Mockett, R.

https://openalex.org/W2130238034,"Growing evidence supports the idea that adhesion via beta(2) integrins not only allows cellular targeting, but also induces intracellular signaling, which in turn activates functional responses of adherent cells. This study investigates whether beta(2) integrin-mediated adhesion of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) has a functional impact on cytokine production. Aggregation of the beta(2) integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) by antibody cross-linking was found to induce substantial de novo synthesis of IL-8 mRNA as measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Northern blotting technique, respectively. Induction of IL-8 mRNA was also observed upon adhesion of PMN to immobilized fibrinogen, a functional equivalent of its clotting product fibrin that serves as a native ligand of Mac-1. Results were confirmed using PMN derived from CD18-deficient mice, which were unable to produce MIP-2 mRNA, a homologue of human IL-8, in the presence of immobilized fibrinogen. In contrast, a substantial increase of MIP-2 mRNA was observed when wild-type PMN were incubated on immobilized fibrinogen. In human PMN, ELISA technique showed that the gene activation that required tyrosine kinase activity resulted in a substantial production and secretion of biologically active IL-8 and IL-1beta. In contrast, no TNF-alpha or IL-6 production was found, revealing that beta(2) integrins mediate differential expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The biological relevance of the present findings was confirmed in an in vivo model of acute inflammation. Altogether, the present findings provide evidence for a functional link between clotting and inflammatory responses that may contribute to the recruitment and/or activation of PMN and other cells at sites of lesion."
https://openalex.org/W2037004543,"Recruitment of the SH2 domain containing cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 to the membrane by somatostatin (SST) is an early event in its antiproliferative signaling that induces intracellular acidification-dependent apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Fas ligation also induces acidification-dependent apoptosis in a manner requiring the presence of SHP-1 at the membrane. Moreover, we have recently reported that SHP-1 is required not only for acidification, but also for apoptotic events that follow acidification (Thangaraju, M., Sharma, K., Liu, D., Shen, S. H., and Srikant, C. B. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 1649–1654). Here we show that ectopically expressed SHP-1 was predominantly membrane-associated and amplified the cytotoxic signaling initiated upon SST receptor activation and Fas ligation. The catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-1 (SHP-1C455S) abolished the ability of the SST agonists to signal apoptosis by preventing the recruitment of wild type SHP-1 to the membrane. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in MCF-7 cells inhibited SST-induced apoptosis upstream of acidification by inhibiting p53-dependent induction of Bax as well as by raising the resting pHi and attenuating SST-induced decrease in pHi. By contrast, Bcl-2 failed to prevent apoptosis triggered by direct acidification. These data demonstrate that (i) membrane-associated SHP-1 is required for receptor-mediated cytotoxic signaling that causes intracellular acidification and apoptosis, and (ii) Bcl-2 acts distal to SHP-1 and p53 to prevent SST-induced acidification but cannot inhibit the apoptotic events that ensue intracellular acidification.

Apoptosis is a unique physiological mechanism that eliminates discrete cells in normal development, host defense, and suppression of oncogenesis. Nuclear changes such as nuclear shrinking, chromatin condensation, oligonucleosomal DNA degradation into multimers of ∼180 base pairs, and characteristic cleavage of nuclear proteins are principal and easily detected end points of apoptosis. The onset of nuclear catastrophe is preceded by events in non-nuclear regions of the cell including activation of proteases and ion-fluxes, and disruption of membrane potentials and cytoskeletal architecture. These are in turn regulated by other cellular components including protein kinases and phosphatases, and members of the Bcl-2 family. The non-transmembrane tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 (SHPTP1/PTP 1The abbreviations used are:PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseSSTsomatostatinSH2Src homology domain 2OCToctreotideNHENa/H exchangerpNPPp-nitrophenol phosphateFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatePIphosphatidylinositolEIPA5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amilorideSSTRsomatostatin receptor1The abbreviations used are:PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseSSTsomatostatinSH2Src homology domain 2OCToctreotideNHENa/H exchangerpNPPp-nitrophenol phosphateFITCfluorescein isothiocyanatePIphosphatidylinositolEIPA5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amilorideSSTRsomatostatin receptor1C/HCP/SHP/PTP-N6) and SHP-2 (PTP1D/PTP2C/SHPTP2/Syp/corkscrew) are critical regulators of cellular function. These protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) contain two amino-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, a catalytic domain and a carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain (1Shen S.H. Bastien L. Posner B.I.

Despite sharing significant sequence identity, these two phosphatases are distinct in their biological roles. For instance, tyrosine kinase signaling is inhibited by SHP-1 but enhanced by SHP-2 (2Tonks N.K. Neel B.G.

SHP-1 is known to associate with multiple signaling molecules such as growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, activated cytokine receptor, interleukin-3 receptor β chain, erythropoietin receptor, interferon α/β receptor, and FCγRIIB receptor (6Tomic S.

Such an association allows SHP-1 to dephosphorylate and inactivate both receptor kinases and non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Jak-2 (9Jiao H. Berrada K. Yang W. Tabrizi M. Platanias L.C. Yi T.

In addition, SHP-1-mediated tyrosine dephosphorylation is implicated in the signaling of cellular apoptosis. Lymphoid cell apoptosis requires SHP-1 and is potentiated by its overexpression (13Su X.

While early studies claimed that SST activates membrane-associated PTP directly we could not confirm such a finding (16Liebow C. Reilly C. Serrano M. Schally A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Instead, our analysis led to the observation that SST promotes translocation of PTP from the cytosol to the membrane (21Srikant C.B. Shen S.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that the antiproliferative signaling of SST results in apoptosis in tumor cells derived from the breast (MCF-7, T47D) and pituitary (AtT-20) (22Candi E. Melino G.

Its cytotoxic action induces an increase in wild type (wt) p53 and Bax and leads to a decrease in pHi and apoptosis in MCF-7 and T47D cells (21Srikant C.B. Shen S.H.

We demonstrated that the cytotoxic signaling of SST is SHP-1-mediated (21Srikant C.B. Shen S.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Direct acidification caused by pH clamping of the medium with the proton ionophore nigericin or by inhibiting Na/H exchanger (NHE) and H+-ATPase also caused apoptosis in a SHP-1-dependent manner in MCF-7 cells (25Thangaraju M. Sharma K. Liu D. Shen S.H. Srikant C.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1649-1654PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, SHP-1 was required not only for SST-induced intracellular acidification but also for acidification-triggered apoptosis to occur (25Thangaraju M. Sharma K. Liu D. Shen S.H. Srikant C.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1649-1654PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 inhibits the collapse of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (Δψm) and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (independent of Δψm), events that are considered early features of apoptosis (26Bossy-Witzel E.

Little is known about how and at what point Bcl-2 protects against stimuli that promote intracellular acidification during apoptosis except that it may act upstream of acidification, possibly by delaying the decrease in pHi (37Furlong I.

In order to obtain definitive evidence for the involvement of SHP-1 in SSTR-initiated and Fas-mediated intracellular acidification cytotoxic signaling, we evaluated the effect of the octapeptide SST analog octreotide (OCT) and Fas ligation in MCF-7 cells transfected with SHP-1 or its catalytically inactive mutant SHP-1C455S. Additionally, we investigated the effect of Bcl-2 overexpression in MCF-7 cells on apoptosis triggered by SST in order to determine at what point Bcl-2 can prevent SHP-1-mediated, acidification-dependent apoptosis signaled by SST. We report here that cytosolic acidification and apoptosis triggered by SSTR activation and Fas ligation are signaled through membrane-associated SHP-1. We also demonstrate that overexpression of Bcl-2 in MCF-7 cells attenuates the inductive effect of SST on Bax and intracellular acidification without influencing the ability of SST to recruit cytosolic SHP-1 to the membrane or to induce p53. However, Bcl-2 failed to prevent apoptosis triggered by direct acidification. These data indicate that (i) membrane-associated SHP-1 is required for intracellular acidification and apoptosis to occur and (ii) Bcl-2 exerts its cytoprotective effect upstream of acidification, but downstream of SHP-1 and p53, by inhibiting p53-dependent induction of Bax as well as by promoting intracellular alkalinization and attenuating SST-induced decrease in pHi. MCF-7, human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (HTB 22), was obtained from ATCC, Bethesda, MD. Octreotide (OCT, SMS 201–995) and its tyrosinated analog [Tyr3]OCT were obtained from Sandoz (Basel, Switzerland); d-[Trp8]SST-14 was supplied by Bachem (Torrance, CA). p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was purchased from Sigma. Annexin-V-FLUOS apoptosis detection kit and anti-CD-95 antibody were purchased from Roche Diagnostics Canada (Montreal, Quebec). Anti-p53 and anti-Bax antibodies were obtained from Oncogene Sciences (Cambridge, MA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and were obtained from regular commercial sources. Cells were plated in 75-cm2 culture flasks and grown in minimal essential medium containing non-essential amino acids and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 mg ml−1 bovine insulin. Native SHP-1 and its catalytically inactive mutant with a Cys455 → Ser mutation (SHP-1C455S) were constructed in the expression vector pRc/cytomegalovirus as described previously (39Zhao Z. Tan Z.

MCF-7 cells were transfected with 10 mg of the pRc/cytomegalovirus vectors containing the respective cDNA by the Lipofectin method. Cells expressing the vectors were selected in medium containing 400 μg of G418. Cells thus selected from three independent transfections with each expression vector were tested for reproducibility. MCF-7 cells stably transfected with the pRc/cytomegalovirus-based plasmids encoding wild type Bcl-2 or the vector alone were established by Zhu et al. (40Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G.W. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of direct acidification, cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 140 mm K+ and 10 μm nigericin as described previously (24Sharma K. Srikant C.B. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of treatment of cells with apoptotic stimuli on the cellular distribution of phosphatase activity and SHP-1, flasks containing equal number of cells (5 × 106) were incubated for 1 h in the absence or presence of 100 nm OCT,d-[Trp8]SST-14, or anti-CD-95 antibody and cytosolic and membrane fractions prepared as described previously. To assess the effect of SST on translocation of SHP-1, flasks containing equal numbers of cells (5 × 106) were incubated for 1 h in the absence or presence of 100 nmd-[Trp8]SST-14. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in buffer containing 200 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. After incubation for 30 min on ice, the cells were homogenized by hand in a Dounce homogenizer with a glass pestle. Homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant and the pelleted membrane fractions were kept at −80 °C. Phosphatase activity in membrane and cytosolic fractions was determined using pNPP as the substrate and SHP-1 immunoblot analysis were carried out as described previously (21Srikant C.B. Shen S.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Thangaraju M. Sharma K. Liu D. Shen S.H. Srikant C.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1649-1654PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was 3-fold higher in SHP-1 expressing cells compared with untransfected MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1). In cells expressing the catalytically inactive mutant SHP-1C455S, despite the comparable increase in protein expression no increase in PTP activity was observed. To assess the effect of SST on translocation of SHP-1, flasks containing 5 × 106 cells were incubated for 1 h with 0 or 100 nm SSTR agonists and cytosolic and membrane fractions prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously (21Srikant C.B. Shen S.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Thangaraju M. Sharma K. Liu D. Shen S.H. Srikant C.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1649-1654PubMed Google Scholar). [125I-Tyr3]OCT was iodinated by the chloramine-T method using carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a μ-Bondapak column (21Srikant C.B. Shen S.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the purified [125I-Tyr3]OCT was 2000 Ci/mmol. Competitive binding assays were carried out using cell membranes. Thirty nanomoles of the radioligand were incubated in the absence or presence of 0–100 nm unlabeled peptide with 50 μg of membrane protein at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 mmHEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm Mg2+, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 200 kallikrein inhibitory units of aprotinin, and 0.02 μg/ml each of bacitracin and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The membrane associated radioactivity was separated by centrifugation, washed, and quantitated in a γ-spectrometer. The data were analyzed by the computer-assisted nonlinear regression analysis (Ligand) program. In addition to its effect on SHP-1, SST affects other second messenger pathways including inhibition of the stimulated adenylyl cyclase-cAMP pathway (41Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Trends Endocrinol. Metabol. 1997; 8: 398-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To determine if the ability of SST to negatively regulate the adenylyl cyclase-cAMP pathway in MCF-7 cells is influenced by expression of SHP-1 or its inactive mutant, we incubated the cells sequentially for 15-min intervals in 1 ml of medium containing 0.5 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and in 1 ml of the same medium with or without 1 μmforskolin in the presence or absence of 100 nmd-[Trp8]SST-14. The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated and extracted in 1 ml of 0.1n HCl. cAMP was measured by using a commercial radioimmunoassay kit (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). Following treatment with the peptide, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated Annexin-V and PI using the apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cellular fluorescence was excited by a 5-watt argon laser generating light at 351–363 nm. PI emission was detected through a 610-nm long pass filter and FITC fluorescence was detected with a 560-nm short pass dichroic filter. At least 10,000 gated events were recorded for each sample and the data analyzed by Winlist software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). To assess DNA fragmentation, cellular DNA was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform from cells incubated in lysis buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, containing 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K) at 48 °C for 30 h. DNA extracts were incubated with 300 mg/ml bovine pancreatic RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h and 10-μg aliquots of DNA samples containing 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide were subjected to inversion field gel electrophoresis on 1.2% (w/v) agarose gels using the Hoefer SwitchbackTMpulse controller and visualized under UV light. For measuring intracellular pH, cells were loaded with 10 μm acetoxymethylester derivative of SNARF-1 during the final hour of incubation in the absence or presence of 100 nm SST agonists or 25 ng of anti-CD95 antibody at 37 °C (42Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then scraped, washed, and maintained at 37 °C in a Becton-Dickinson FACStar Vantage cytometer. Intracellular carboxyl SNARF-1 was excited at 488 nm and emission was recorded at both 580 and 640 nm with 5-nm band-pass filters with linear amplifiers. The ratio of the emissions at these wavelengths was electronically calculated and used as a parameter indicative of intracellular pH. The intracellular pH values in control and treated cells were estimated by comparison of the mean ratios of the samples to a calibration curve of intracellular pH generated by incubation of carboxy-SNARF-1 loaded cells in buffers ranging in pH from 8.0 to 6.25 and containing nigericin. Cells with fluorescence of <50 units were excluded in the calculation of the ratio of the emissions at 580 and 640 nm. Cells stained with anti-p53 or anti-Bax antibodies were counterstained with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody following which DNA was labeled with PI and the RNA removed by digestion with RNase I as described previously (24Sharma K.

We first established that overexpression of SHP-1, its inactive mutant, or Bcl-2 did not alter SSTR levels since the binding capacity determined by saturation binding analysis using [125I-Tyr3]OCT was similar in all cell lines and ranged from 356 ± 34 to 389 ± 65 fmol/mg protein. Likewise the affinity of [125I-Tyr3]OCT was also remained unaltered (K d = 88–143 nm). OCT (100 nm) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP by 47 ± 4% in both control and transfected MCF-7 cell lines (not shown). To determine the effect of the overexpression of these proteins on SSTR-signaled apoptosis, we measured Annexin-V labeling in cells incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm OCT for 24 h. Increased Annexin-V labeling, a characteristic of apoptotic cells, was seen in OCT-treated control cells and in cells expressing SHP-1 but not SHP-1C455S Fig.2 A, compare panels B, D, andF. The ability of OCT to signal apoptosis was higher in SHP-1 transfected cells compared with control cells as seen from the ∼2.5-fold increase in Annexin-V labeling (66 ± 8versus 27 ± 6%, respectively, mean ± S.E.,n = 3). Expression of the vector alone in MCF-7 cells had no influence on the ability of OCT to signal apoptosis (not shown). OCT-induced cytotoxic signaling occurred faster in SHP-1 transfected cells as evidenced by the formation of DNA fragments by 2 h compared to 6 h in untransfected cells; the extent of apoptosis at subsequent time points was higher in SHP-1 cells than in control cells (Fig. 2 B). In MCF-7 cells, SHP-1 was recruited to the membrane by OCT as revealed by immunoblot analysis (Fig.3). Activities for hydolyzing pNPP in untreated and treated MCF-7 cells were 0.53 ± 0.04versus 0.24 ± 0.02 nmol/mg of protein/min (cytosol) and 0.32 ± 0.03 versus 0.84 ± 0.06 nmol/mg of protein/min (membrane), respectively. Additionally we show that in SHP-1 cells, the enzyme protein was predominantly membrane-associated even in the absence of OCT treatment. Nevertheless, OCT induced a further increase in the membrane associated enzyme activity (1.69 ± 0.14 versus 1.38 ± 0.15 nmol/mg of protein/min, respectively, in the treated and untreated cells). By contrast, the translocation of SHP-1 to the membrane was blocked by the catalytically inactive mutant SHP-1C455S. In contrast to its effect on SHP-1, OCT did not alter the subcellular distribution of SHP-2 in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4).Figure 4OCT does not affect the cellular distribution of SHP-2. Cytosolic and membrane fractions of MCF-7 cells incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 100 nm peptide were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis using anti-SHP-2 antibody (data representative of three experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that activation of a cation-insensitive, acidic endonuclease occurs concomitantly with a decrease in pHi in MCF-7 cells undergoing OCT-induced apoptosis (24Sharma K.

OCT-induced acidification as indicated by the increase in the fluorescence of the pH-sensitive dye carboxy-SNARF-1 at 580 nm relative to that at 640 nm was higher in SHP-1 expressing cells than in untransfected cells (Fig. 5, compare panels 2 and 4). By contrast, OCT failed to induce acidification in cells expressing SHP-1C455S (Fig. 5,panel 6). Intracellular pH was calculated from the ratios of fluorescence measured at 580 and 640 nm wavelengths (25Thangaraju M. Sharma K. Liu D. Shen S.H. Srikant C.B.

Interestingly, the resting pHi was lower in the SHP-1 transfected cells and higher in the SHP-1C455S transfected cells (7.07 and 7.40, respectively) compared with that of 7.25 in MCF-7 cells (Fig.5 B). OCT-induced decrease in pHi in untransfected MCF-7 cells from 7.25 ± 0.07 to 7.2 ± 0.1 by 2 h and was maximal at 24 h (6.54 ± 0.06). By contrast, the rate and extent of OCT-induced acidification in SHP-1 overexpressing cells were higher: pHi decreased by 0.7 unit by 2 h and >1 unit after 24 h (pH = 6.5 ± 0.2 and <6, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W1601293666,"Hyperacute rejection (HAR) is the first critical immunological hurdle that must be addressed in order to develop xenogeneic organs for human transplantation. In the area of cell-based xenotransplant therapies, natural antibodies (XNA) and complement have also been considered barriers to successful engraftment. Transgenic expression of human complement inhibitors in donor cells and organs has significantly prolonged the survival of xenografts. However, expression of complement inhibitors without eliminating xenogeneic natural antibody (XNA) reactivity may provide insufficient protection for clinical application. An approach designed to prevent XNA reactivity during HAR is the expression of human alpha1, 2-fucosyltransferase (H-transferase, HT). H-transferase expression modifies the cell surface carbohydrate phenotype of the xenogeneic cell, resulting in the expression of the universal donor O antigen and a concomitant reduction in the expression of the antigenic Galalpha1,3-Gal epitope. We have engineered various transgenic pig lines that express HT in different cells and tissues, including the vascular endothelium. We demonstrate that in two different HT transgenic lines containing two different HT promoter constructs, expression can be differentially regulated in a constitutive and cytokine-inducible manner. The transgenic expression of HT results in a significant reduction in the expression of the Galalpha1,3-Gal epitope, reduced XNA reactivity, and an increased resistance to human serum-mediated cytolysis. Transgenic pigs that express H-transferase promise to become key components for the development of xenogeneic cells and organs for human transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1575826900,"In previous work, 3-dimensional descriptors of protein function ('fuzzy functional forms') were used to identify disulfide oxidoreductase active sites in high-resolution protein structures. During this analysis, a potential disulfide oxidoreductase active site in the serine/threonine protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) crystal structure was discovered. In PP1, the potential redox active site is located in close proximity to the phosphatase active site. This result is interesting in view of literature suggesting that serine/threonine phosphatases could be subject to redox control mechanisms within the cell; however, the actual source of this control is unknown. Additional analysis presented here shows that the putative oxidoreductase active site is highly conserved in the serine/threonine phosphatase-1 subfamily, but not in the serine/threonine phosphatase-2A or -2B subfamilies. These results demonstrate the significant advantages of using structure-based motifs for protein functional site identification. First, a putative disulfide oxidoreductase active site has been identified in serine-threonine phosphatases using a descriptor built from the glutaredoxin/thioredoxin family, proteins that have no apparent evolutionary relationship whatsoever to the PP1 proteins. Second, the proximity of the putative disulfide oxidoreductase active site to the phosphatase active site provides evidence toward a regulatory control mechanism. No sequence-based method could provide either piece of information."

https://openalex.org/W1837700344,"The human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp) contributes to the phenomenon of multidrug resistance during cancer and AIDS chemotherapy. A potential novel strategy to circumvent the effects of P-gp during chemotherapy is to prevent maturation of P-gp during biosynthesis so that the transporter does not reach the cell surface. Here we report that immature, core-glycosylated P-gp that is prevented from reaching the cell surface by processing mutations or by proteasome inhibitors such as lactacystin or MG-132 exhibited no detectable drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Disulfide cross-linking analysis also showed that the immature P-gp did not exhibit ATP-induced conformational changes as found in the mature enzyme. In addition, the immature P-gp was more sensitive to trypsin than the mature enzyme. These results suggest that P-gp is unlikely to be functional immediately after synthesis. These differences in the structural and enzymatic properties of the mature and core-glycosylated, immature P-gp could potentially be used during chemotherapy, and should result in the search for compounds that can specifically inhibit the maturation of P-gp.—Loo, T.

An infrared-guided laser stimulation was used to release glutamate from caged glutamate in the focal spot of an ultraviolet laser. A burst of light flashes caused an LTD-like depression of glutamate receptor responses, which was highly confined to the region of ""tetanic"" stimulation (<10 micrometers). A similar depression of glutamate receptor responses was observed during LTD of synaptic transmission. A spatially highly specific postsynaptic mechanism can account for the LTD induced by glutamate release."
https://openalex.org/W2124129686,"Neuronal necrosis and apoptosis occur after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in animals and contribute to subsequent neurological deficits. In contrast, relatively little apoptosis is found after mechanical injury in vitro. Because in vivo trauma models and clinical head injury have associated cerebral ischemia and/or metabolic impairment, we transiently impaired cellular metabolism after mechanical trauma of neuronal-glial cultures by combining 3-nitropropionic acid treatment with concurrent glucose deprivation. This produced greater neuronal cell death than mechanical trauma alone. Such injury was attenuated by the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK801). In addition, this injury significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells over that accruing from mechanical injury alone. This apoptotic cell death was accompanied by DNA fragmentation, attenuated by cycloheximide, and associated with an increase in caspase-3-like but not caspase-1-like activity. Cell death was reduced by the pan-caspase inhibitor BAF or the caspase-3 selective inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk, whereas the caspase-1 selective inhibitor z-YVAD-fmk had no effect; z-DEVD-fmk also reduced the number of apoptotic cells after combined injury. Moreover, cotreatment with MK801 and BAF resulted in greater neuroprotection than either drug alone. Thus, in vitro trauma with concurrent metabolic inhibition parallels in vivo TBI, showing both NMDA-sensitive necrosis and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis."

Here we show that human airway smooth muscle express type I nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which results in inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. In addition, superoxide dismutase (SOD), a cell-permeable mimetic that increases the biological half-life and therefore enhances the biological activity of endogenously released nitric oxide (NO), or NO-releasing drugs also greatly reduce DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Observations in this study have important clinical implications: 1) NOS inhibition may exacerbate airway disease and 2) inhaled SOD/mimetics or NO/nitrovasodilators may be therapies for the treatment of asthma or chronic obliterative pulmonary disease."
https://openalex.org/W1627733561,"A regulatory role for intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in adipocyte lipogenesis, lipolysis and triglyceride accumulation has been demonstrated. Compounds acting on the pancreatic sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) to increase (e.g., glibenclamide) or decrease (e.g., diazoxide) [Ca2+]i cause corresponding increases and decreases in weight gain. However, these weight gain and loss effects have been attributed to insulin release rather than to the primary effects of these compounds on the adipocyte SUR and its associated K(ATP) channel. Accordingly, we have evaluated the direct role of the human adipocyte SUR in regulating adipocyte metabolism. We used RT-PCR with primers for a highly conserved region of SUR1 to demonstrate that human adipocytes express SUR1. The PCR product was confirmed by sequence analysis and used as a probe to demonstrate adipocyte SUR1 expression by Northern blot analysis. Adipocytes exhibited glibenclamide dose-responsive (0-20 microM) increases in [Ca2+]i (P<0.05). Similarly, glibenclamide (10 microM) caused a 67% increase in adipocyte fatty acid synthase activity (P<0.001), a 48% increase in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (P<0.01) and a 68% inhibition in lipolysis (P<0.01), whereas diazoxide (10 microM) completely prevented each of these effects. These data demonstrate that human adipocytes express a SUR that regulates [Ca2+]i and, consequently, exerts coordinate control over lipogenesis and lipolysis. Accordingly, the adipocyte SUR1 may represent an important target for the development of therapeutic interventions in obesity."

Sulfonamide reactive metabolites have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these adverse reactions. Sulfamethoxazole hydroxylamine (SMX-HA) induces lymphocyte toxicity and suppression of proliferation in vitro; the mechanism(s) of these immunomodulatory effects remain unknown. We investigated the cytotoxicity of SMX-HA via apoptosis on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified cell subpopulations in vitro. CD19+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells were isolated from human peripheral blood by positive selection of cell surface molecules by magnetic bead separation. SMX-HA induced significant CD8+ cell death (67 ± 7%) at 100 µM SMX-HA, with only minimal CD4+ cell death (8 ± 4%). No significant subpopulation toxicity was shown when incubated with parent drug (SMX). Flow cytometry measuring phosphatidylserine externalization 24 h after treatment with 100 µM and 400 µM SMX-HA revealed 14.1 ± 0.7% and 25.6 ± 4.2% annexin-positive cells, respectively, compared to 3.7 ± 1.2% in control PBMCs treated with 400 µM SMX. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed in quiescent and stimulated PBMCs 48 h after incubation with SMX-HA.

https://openalex.org/W1868542570,"Heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (HL-GAGs) play a central role in the biological activity and signaling behavior of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2). Recent studies, however, indicate that FGF-2 may be able to signal in the absence of HLGAG, raising the question of the nature of the role of HLGAG in FGF-2 signaling. In this study, we present a conceptual framework for FGF-2 signaling and derive a simple model from it that describes signaling via both HL-GAG-independent and HLGAG-dependent pathways. The model is validated with F32 cell proliferation data using wild-type FGF-2, heparin binding mutants (K26A, K119A/R120A, K125A), and receptor binding mutants (Y103A, Y111A/W114A). In addition, this model can predict the cellular response of FGF-2 and its mutants as a function of FGF-2 and HLGAG concentration based on experimentally determined thermodynamic parameters. We show that FGF-2-mediated cellular response is a function of both FGF-2 and HLGAG concentrations and that a reduction of one of the components can be compensated for by an increase in the other to achieve the same measure of cellular response. Analysis of the mutant FGF-2 molecules show that reduction in heparin binding interactions and primary receptor site binding interactions can also be compensated for in the same manner. These results suggest a molecular mechanism that could be used by cells in physiological systems to modulate the FGF-2-mediated cellular response by controlling HLGAG expression.—Padera, R., Venkataraman, G., Berry, D., Godavarti, R., Sasisekharan, R.

https://openalex.org/W1797098074,"The heterodimeric DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) is responsible for DNA degradation into nucleosomal units during apoptosis. This process needs the caspase-dependent release of ICAD/DFF-45, the inhibitory subunit of DFF. Here we report that triggering apoptosis via a hyperos-motic shock in hematopoietic cells causes the appearance of mitochondrial and cytosolic alterations, activation of caspases, chromatin condensation, nuclear disruption, and DNA fragmentation. However, oligonucleosomal but not high molecular weight (50–150 kb) DNA cleavage is abolished if Cl− efflux is prevented by using NaCl to raise extracellular osmolarity or by Cl− channel blockers, even when apoptosis is initiated by other agents (staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody). In these conditions, all the apo-ptosis hallmarks investigated remain detectable, including the cleavage of ICAD/DFF-45. In vitro assays with lysates of cells in which Cl− efflux is blocked confirm the lack of internucleosomal DNA degradation. These findings establish that neither caspase activation nor ICAD/DFF-45 processing per se is sufficient to induce oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and that high molecular weight DNA degradation and chromatin condensation appear independently of it. Finally, they suggest that Cl− efflux is a necessary cofactor that intervenes specifically in the activation of the DFF endonuclease.—Rasola, A., Farahi Far, D., Hofman, P., Rossi, B.

https://openalex.org/W1928003261,"Human fibroblasts and keratinocytes possess nitric oxide synthases (NOS), which metabolize L-arginine (L-Arg) for producing nitric oxide (NO*). This report delineates the relations between NO* and UVA in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. NOS activity was stimulated by exposure of cells to L-Arg just after irradiation. L-Arg (5 mM) supply led to an increase in UVA (25.3 J/cm(2)) cytotoxicity (% of viability 18 +/- 3%) whereas neither L-Arg itself nor UVA irradiation induced cell death at the doses used in this study. Cells were also treated either with L-thiocitrulline (L-Thio), an irreversible inhibitor of NOS, or with exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. L-Thio and SOD prevented L-Arg-mediated deleterious effects in irradiated cells, whereas catalase was ineffective. Intracellular antioxidant enzyme activities were also determined. UVA/L-Arg stress altered catalase (66% decrease) and glutathione peroxidase (83% decrease). DNA damage was evaluated using the 'comet assay' and quantified using the 'tail moment'. UVA alone was genotoxic (mean tail moment: 25.43 +/- 1.23, P<0.001 compared control cells). The addition of L-Arg potentiated DNA damage (mean tail moment: 41.05+/-3.9) whereas L-Thio prevented them (mean tail moment 9.86 +/- 0.98). We attempted to assess the effect of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition on cell death. Using the PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide, we established that PARP determines both cell lysis and DNA damage induced by UVA and/or L-Arg. Our findings demonstrated that L-Arg was able to increase UVA-mediated deleterious effects in keratinocytes (both DNA damage and cytotoxicity) and that the ratio NO*/O2*- plays a key role in these processes."

The two predominant tropomyosin isoforms expressed in striated muscle are α- and β-tropomyosin, which exhibit an 86% amino acid identity between themselves. Previous studies by our laboratory utilized a transgenic mouse system to overexpress β-tropomyosin in the heart to address the functional differences between these two tropomyosin isoforms. Interestingly, when a high percentage of β-tropomyosin replaces α-tropomyosin in the hearts of transgenic mice, the mice die due to severe cardiac abnormalities. In this study, we have rescued these high expression β-tropomyosin mice by turning off the α-myosin heavy chain promoter, which is driving the β-tropomyosin transgene.

In vertebrates, there are four TM genes (α, β, TM30, and TM4). These genes utilize alternative splicing mechanisms to generate multiple tissue- and development-specific isoforms. As such, TM transcripts and their associated proteins display significant nucleotide and amino acid conservation among themselves. For example, there is an 87% amino acid identity between the α- and β-TM striated muscle isoforms. Previous investigations have established that the muscle-specific α- and β-TM isoforms are present in different quantitative levels in various muscles (1Schachat F. Briggs M. Williamson E.

In this model, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress β-TM striated muscle specifically in the adult heart. Results show the α-/β-TM ratio is critical in determining myocardial performance. Under normal conditions, there is 98% α-TM and 2% β-TM in the murine heart; mice expressing 45% α-TM and 55% β-TM display a significant delay in the time of myocardial relaxation and a decrease in the maximum rate of relaxation in the heart. These physiological changes occur without a net change in the total amount of TM that is produced. Additional studies demonstrate that the functional changes that occur are due to an increased sensitivity to Ca2+exhibited by the cardiac myofibers of the transgenic mice (4Palmiter K. Kitada Y. Muthuchamy M. Wieczorek D. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11611-11614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Morphological analyses show that there are no structural changes in the heart or in the sarcomere that are associated with altered 45% α-TM/55% β-TM ratio. In additional studies, we have recently found that when hemizygous β-TM transgenic mice were mated, the resulting neonatal homozygous pups die within 10–14 days (5Muthuchamy M. Boivin G. Grupp I. Wieczorek D.F. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1545-1557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These mice express 75% β-TM protein in their myocardium and develop severe cardiac abnormalities (which include large thrombi and severely enlarged atria and ventricles) within 3–5 days after birth. Ventricular muscle strips from these high expression β-TM mice show altered contractile and relaxation parameters. These results clearly demonstrated that myofiber activity and cardiac function are dramatically influenced by the TM isoform population. In the current investigation, we have rescued the high expression β-TM homozygous transgenic mice and increased their survival through 8 weeks. This was accomplished by taking advantage of the thyroid regulatory elements located in the promoter of the α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene, which was used to drive the transgene construct. By administering a diet containing 5-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU), the α-MHC promoter is shut down in the ventricle; however, this treatment simultaneously activates a complex program of genes associated with cardiac hypertrophy, such as β-MHC and atrial naturetic factor. Although these transgenic mice survive with this PTU treatment, echocardiographic analysis of these rescued mice demonstrates an altered myocardial function. Moreover, when the PTU is withdrawn, the expression of exogenous β-TM is restored in the heart, and these mice die within 2 weeks from severe cardiac defects. This is the first report demonstrating that transcriptional regulatory elements within the α-MHC promoter can be manipulated to rescue potentially lethal phenotypes, such as high expression β-TM or tropomodulin transgenic mice (5Muthuchamy M.

Thus, PTU can regulate expression of transgenes driven by the α-MHC promoter and effectively rescue mice from death due to overexpression of exogenous transgenes. The generation of β-TM overexpression transgenic mice was described previously (3Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol.

The hypothyroid condition was induced by feeding a diet containing 0.15% PTU (Teklad Premier) to pregnant female β-TM TG mice (15 days postcoitus) who were mated with male β-TM TG mice. This diet was maintained until the newborn mice reached 4 weeks of age; some litters were switched to a normal diet for 1 week following PTU treatment. We have previously used this PTU-containing diet to induce hypothyroidism in β-TM transgenic mice, as confirmed by determination of T4 serum levels (3Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was extracted from tail clips by overnight digestion at 60 °C. Purified DNA (10 μg) was digested with EcoRI, Southern blotted to nylon membrane, and hybridized with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to the SV40 3′-untranslated region. The copy number of the transgenes integrated into the genomic DNA was quantified using an ImageQuant PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Moderate copy mice used in this study have 45–56 copies of the β-TM transgene; high copy mice have ∼110 copies of the transgene. Serial diluted total RNA from total heart preparations was slot-blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Several blots were prepared and hybridized with radiolabeled isoform-specific probes for striated muscle-specific α- and β-TM, α- and β-MHC, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The α-TM probe is a 363-base pair SstI fragment, and the β-TM probe is a 299-base pair PstI/BglII fragment obtained from mouse cDNAs. The oligonucleotide used for α-MHC is 5′-CGAACGTTTATGTTTATTGTGGATTGGCCACAGCGAGGGTCTGCTGGAGAGG-3′, and the oligonucleotide used for β-MHC is 5′-GCTTTATTCTGCTTCCACCTAAAGGGCTGTTGCAA AGGCTCCAGGTCTGAGGGCTTC-3′. Each hybridization signal was quantified using an ImageQuant PhosphorImager. Total protein homogenates were prepared from heart tissue from each experimental and control group as described (7Bronson D. Schachat F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3937-3944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of protein amounts was performed using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and equivalent amounts (20 μg) were subjected to Western blot analyses using a monoclonal striated muscle TM-specific antibody as described (Sigma). The intensity of the bands was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Hearts were removed and immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24–48 h. The hearts were then transferred to a solution of 70% ethyl alcohol until processed. Sections of 5 μm were prepared and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The animals were lightly anesthetized with 2.5% avertin (0.01 ml/g of body weight) and allowed to breathe spontaneously. Two-dimensionally targeted M-mode studies were performed with a 10-MHz intraoperative scan head imaging transducer (ATL HDI 3000) using methods previously described (8Hoit B Khoury E. Kranias E. Mall N. Walsh R. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This transducer has a small offset footprint and has outstanding near field imaging quality. M-mode measurements end diastolic (EDD) and end systolic (ESD) dimension, end diastolic thickness of the septum (IVSed), and posterior wall (PWed) were made online using the calculations package on the ultrasonograph. Left ventricular (LV) mass was calculated using a validated M-mode method as follows: LV mass = ((IVSDed + PWed + EDD)3 − (EDD)3) × 1.05. Left ventricular fractional shortening (FS) was calculated as FS = (EDD − ESD)/EDD. Peak filling rates were measured off line from digitized M-mode using commercial software (Tomtec). High level expression β-TM transgenic mice were generated by mating hemizygous β-TM transgenic mice within identical or different lines (3Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Muthuchamy M. Boivin G. Grupp I. Wieczorek D.F. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1545-1557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At 15 days postcoitus, pregnant hemizygous mothers were fed a diet containing PTU to down-regulate expression of thyroid hormone in the developing fetuses. This diet was continued while the newborn pups were nursed by the mother. One effect of PTU is to down-regulate the α-MHC promoter, which drives the β-TM transgene (3Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). With a diet containing PTU, the newborn mice were uniformly similar in size and weight compared with wild type. At 2 weeks postnatal, the mice were genotyped by genomic Southern blot analyses using DNA isolated from the tail. As shown in Fig.1, results from the autoradiograph show that a 6.8-kilobase pair band is detectable following hybridization of genomic DNA to a radiolabeled SV40 fragment present in the transgene. Mice carrying high and moderate copy numbers of the transgene can be readily distinguished from their nontransgenic littermate controls. By giving PTU to the expectant mothers and continuing this treatment following delivery, the high expression β-TM transgenic mice were able to survive past their normal life span of 10–14 days up to 8 weeks. However, hypothyroidism causes pleotrophic effects upon biological systems, including growth retardation and weight loss (9Katzeff H. Ojamaa K. Klein I. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E63-E67PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon was exhibited by the mice receiving PTU; after 4 weeks, the weanlings, regardless of genotype, were phenotypically similar in size and weight (7–8 g); this weight is approximately half the expected weight of 15 g for a nontransgenic, non-PTU-treated mouse. Interestingly, hypothyroidism is also known to cause cardiac hypertrophy and reactivation of the fetal gene program (10Izumo S. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Initial results show that moderate copy TG and control mice exhibit a similar heart weight/body weight ratio at 30 days (Fig.2). This result is in agreement with previous studies conducted by our laboratory showing no gross morphological differences exist between moderate β-TM TG mice and their wild type controls (3Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mice treated with PTU show an increased heart/body weight ratio over nontreated animals. Within the PTU group, there is a tendency for a higher ratio in the moderate and high copy β-TM transgenic mice. If the mice are switched back to a normal diet (non-PTU diet) after 30 days of PTU treatment, by 7 days there is a significant difference in the heart weight/body weight ratio between the high copy β-TM transgenic mice and wild type controls. The primary reason for this difference appears to be a more rapid increase in body weight of the wild type mice compared with the transgenic mice. For the transgenic mice, the switch back to a normal diet allows the reoccurrence of exogenous β-TM protein. In the high copy mice, this increased β-TM results in the development of severe pathological cardiac abnormalities, similar to the abnormalities that develop in the non-PTU-treated high β-TM expression neonatal mice (5Muthuchamy M. Boivin G. Grupp I. Wieczorek D.F. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1545-1557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thrombi formation in these mice restricts blood flow to the systemic circulation and severely curtails growth and development, thus leading to an increased heart weight concomitant with a reduced body size and weight. Once these mice are switched from a PTU-containing diet to normal feed, they die within 7–10 days. Previous work by ourselves and others has shown that endogenous TM expression is not regulated by thyroid hormone levels (3Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,10Izumo S. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). To quantify levels of TM expression in the β-TM mice and their controls, total RNA from cardiac tissue was isolated, slot-blotted, and hybridized with radiolabeled, isoform-specific probes. A 299-base pair striated muscle-specific β-TM cDNA probe was generated using polymerase chain reaction. Results in Fig.3 show that the β-TM is not expressed in hearts from non-TG mice, regardless of their PTU status. Moderate copy β-TM mice do express significant levels of β-TM in their hearts because of the α-MHC-driven transgene. These levels decrease upon the addition of PTU to the diet and return to high levels following the switch to the normal diet. High copy mice subject to PTU have low levels of exogenous β-TM expression that are increased following the return to the normal diet after 30 days. These results show that PTU is effective in down-regulating the expression of the α-MHC promoter/β-TM transgene, which results in prolonged viability of the high copy β-TM mice. To ascertain whether overexpression of β-TM affected the expression of the endogenous α-TM striated muscle isoform, we probed RNA slot blots for α-TM striated muscle message. A 363-base pair α-TM cDNA fragment was purified, radiolabeled with 32P, and hybridized with cardiac RNA from non-TG, moderate copy TG, and high copy TG mice. As seen in Fig. 3, α-TM striated muscle message is detected in all samples. The non-TG control mice exhibit a greater amount of α-TM message than moderate copy TG mice, which is in agreement with previous studies by our laboratory (3Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As previously mentioned, PTU treatment does not affect endogenous α-TM expression. When the TG mice are switched from a PTU diet to a normal diet, the level of α-TM expression decreases, presumably due to the increased expression of β-TM from the transgene, which causes a TM feedback mechanism to decrease the production of α-TM striated muscle. This lower quantifiable level of α-TM expression is also evident in the adult control TG mice. Previous studies have established that translational mechanisms are operative in the regulation of TM protein synthesis (11Rethinasamy P. Muthuchamy M. Hewett T. Boivin G. Wolska B. Evans C. Solaro R.J. Wieczorek D.F. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,12Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 134-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To examine whether the changes in TM expression at the transcript level were reflected at the translational level, total protein extracts were prepared from the hearts of the various experimental groups. These protein preparations were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blotted using a striated muscle-specific TM antibody that immunologically reacts with both α- and β-TM. Results show that both α- and β-TM are distinguishable and are expressed at quantifiable levels reflective of the dietary treatment to which the mice were exposed (Fig. 4 A). As expected, wild type control mice do not produce β-TM, either at 1 month or in adulthood (lanes 1 and 9, respectively), whereas transgenic mice express β-TM protein at 1 month and in the adult (lanes 2 and10). PTU treatment decreases the α-MHC promoter activity, which results in lowered β-TM production in both TG and high copy mice (lanes 4 and 5); as stated previously, endogenous TM levels are not altered by PTU treatment (lane 3). Switching to the normal diet in the 30-day-old mice reactivates the promoter, and expression of β-TM protein is increased (lanes 7 and 8). These results clearly demonstrate that the changes exhibited at the transcript level are also reflected at the translational level. A PhosphorImager quantitative analysis shows that total TM protein in these mice remains relatively constant (Fig. 4 B). Although the ratio of α- and β-TM dramatically changes with transgene copy number and the regulation of the promoter by PTU treatment, translational control mechanisms appear operative to ensure that a constant level of TM is produced within the cardiomyocyte. Similar results have been obtained with overexpression of other TM isoforms (3Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,13Muthuchamy M. Pieples K. Rethinasamy P. Hoit B. Grupp I. Boivin G. Wolska B. Evans C. Solaro R.J. Wieczorek D.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cardiac muscle α-MHC is the predominant MHC isoform expressed in the adult murine myocardium. Moreover, the ventricular expression of this myosin heavy chain isoform is regulated by thyroid hormone regulatory elements. To determine the effect of the PTU treatment on α-MHC expression, we generated an α-MHC-specific oligonucleotide probe corresponding to 3′-untranslated region sequence. This probe was radiolabeled and hybridized to RNA from hearts of the various experimental groups. Results in Fig. 3 show that in the absence of PTU, both non-TG and TG mice have equivalent levels of α-MHC expression. With the addition of PTU to the diet, α-MHC expression decreases; this reduction is most pronounced in the non-TG mice but also occurs in the moderate copy β-TG mice. Interestingly, α-MHC expression appears slightly increased in the high copy β-TG mice; we speculate that continued expression of α-MHC in the presence of PTU may be due to increased numbers of thyroid hormone regulatory elements present in these mice and nonsaturating conditions of the PTU in blocking all of the thyroid hormone regulatory elements (see “Discussion”). With the return to a normal diet, α-MHC expression switches back to control levels in the non-TG and moderate copy mice; interestingly, the high copy mice do not alter expression of α-MHC after switching back to normal feed. Numerous studies have demonstrated that α- and β-MHC are antithetically regulated in the myocardium. The β-MHC gene is not expressed in the hearts of control non-TG mice (Fig. 3); however, there is low expression of β-MHC message in the β-TM TG mice at 30 days. When the mice are subject to PTU treatment, β-MHC is dramatically increased in non-TG mice. When the PTU diet mice are switched back to normal feed, β-MHC expression decreases for the non-TG and high copy TG mice; there is a slight increase in β-MHC expression in the moderate TG mice following the change in diet from PTU to normal feed. The results of α- and β-MHC expression in the presence of PTU reflect the complex pattern of cardiac muscle gene expression that results following the administration of PTU to mice. Furthermore, following the switch from PTU to normal feed, the β-TM transgene is reactivated, and in the case of the high copy mice, develops severe dilation and hypertrophy, which culminates in lethality. To demonstrate that equivalent amounts of total RNA were loaded for the various experimental groups, we stripped the RNA slot blot free of probes and rehybridized to a radiolabeled mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA fragment. As seen in Fig. 3, equivalent levels of signal are detected in all of the lanes for the various experimental groups. These results demonstrate that the changes detected for TM and MHC isoforms are due to alterations in expression for these genes and not due to differential loading of RNA samples. Previous studies show that there are no morphological differences between control and moderate copy β-TM TG mice (3Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). On the other hand, high copy β-TM TG mice exhibit several pathological abnormalities, including thrombus formation in the lumen of the atria and ventricles, along with chamber dilation, fibrosis, and diffuse myocytolysis (5Muthuchamy M. Boivin G. Grupp I. Wieczorek D.F. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1545-1557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As stated previously, these high copy mice succumb by day 10–14, postpartum. To morphologically examine the hearts following reversal of lethality by PTU treatment followed by a return to the normal diet, cardiac histology was performed on littermate high copy, heterozygous, and control mice. These mice underwent 30 days of PTU treatment followed by 7 days of a normal diet prior to examination. A comparative pathological analysis demonstrates that both moderate and high copy TG mice undergo similar diffuse cytoplasmic changes, which are most severe in the atria (Fig. 5). These alterations are characterized by decreased or lost striations, decreased staining intensity, vacuolization, separation of the cytoplasm from the cell membrane, and waviness of the myofibers. A high percentage (70–100%) of atrial cells are affected, whereas there is characteristically only ∼20–40% ventricular involvement, with the apex being primarily affected. The non-TG control animals did not exhibit these dramatic cytoplasmic alterations; however, mild myocyte hypertrophy was present in all PTU-treated mice. To assess the in vivo cardiac performance of the PTU-treated mice, we performed echocardiographic analyses. Heart rate, peak filling rate, and percentage fractional shortening measurements were conducted in control and moderate copy TG mice. (The high copy mice treated with PTU or on the “switched” diet were unable to tolerate the light anesthesia associated with echocardiography and succumbed during the procedure; this result is surprising, since the pathological abnormalities found in the high copy PTU diet mice were mild and similar to those found in the moderate copy TG mice (see “Discussion”).) The mice were evaluated after 30 days of PTU treatment and also after switching them to a normal diet for 7 days. The measured values provided a functional assessment of cardiac performance following the changes in gene expression associated with PTU administration and following the re-expression of the β-TM transgene. There were no significant differences in heart rate between wild type and TG mice when treated with PTU (207 ± 21 versus194 ± 19 beats/min, respectively) (TableI). However, when the mice are switched back to a normal diet not containing PTU, significant differences in heart rate appear; the heart rate of wild type mice on a normal diet is 327 ± 23 beats/min versus 222 ± 23 beats/min for TG mice. This increased heart rate for wild type mice on the normal diet is also significantly higher than wild type mice treated with PTU, which may be reflective of changes in myosin isozymes and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, which are transcriptionally regulated by T3 levels. The inability of the TG mice to increase their heart rate after the removal of PTU may reflect the re-expression of the β-TM transgene and its influence on sarcomeric function and diastole.Table ICardiac performance in wild type and TG micePTUSwitchedWild type (n = 6)TG (n = 8)Wild type (n= 4)TG (n = 9)LVEDDaLeft ventricular end diastolic dimension.(mm)2.4 ± 0.22.6 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.12.5 ± 0.1LVESDbLeft ventricular end systolic dimension.

Ventricular diastole is composed of an early rapid phase due to ventricular relaxation and the left atrioventricular pressure gradient and late diastolic filling due to atrial contraction and ventricular compliance. We measured the early rapid phase from digitized M-mode echocardiograms. Results show that there is no difference between wild type and moderate TG cardiac peak filling rates when on PTU (13.0 ± 1.5 versus 11.5 ± 1.4 mm/s). However, when the mice are shifted to a normal diet, the wild type mice increase their peak filling rate to 15. 1 + 1.8 mm/s, whereas the TG mice decrease their peak filling rate to 10.2 + 1.2 mm/s (p < 0.05). This decrease in filling rate for the TG mice may reflect the delay in relaxation associated with diastole of β-TM TG mice (3Muthuchamy M. Grupp I. Grupp G. O'Toole B. Kier A. Boivin G. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In PTU-treated mice, there were no significant differences in left ventricular dimensions, fractional shortening, peak filling rate, left ventricular mass, or heart rate. However, after diets were switched, fractional shortening, peak filling rates, and heart rates were significantly different in transgenic than wild type animals. Results from the M-mode echocardiographic analysis of the wild type and transgenic mice showed that the fractional shortening was similar in wild type mice on PTU or the switched diet (45.9 ± 1.2versus 46.8 ± 1.5). Also, there was no significant difference in fractional shortening between wild type and moderate TG mice when on PTU (45.9 ± 1.2 versus 38.9 ± 3.4); however, there was a difference in fractional shortening (p < 0.05) between wild type and moderate TG mice on the switched diet (46.8 ± 1.5 versus 33.9 ± 2.5). Exploration of protein isoform diversity is essential to understand sarcomeric function in striated muscle. Tropomyosin, an essential component of the thin filament, is composed of α- and β-TM isoforms, which exhibit an 86% amino acid identity between themselves (14Muthuchamy M. Rethinasamy P. Wieczorek D.F. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This highly conserved homology extends throughout the entire protein, with amino acid substitutions scattered throughout the molecules. Defining the functional significance of α-versus β-TM has been accomplished through the usage of transgenic mice, where our laboratory has utilized the α-MHC promoter to overexpress the β-TM isoform in the heart. Results show that functional differences exist between these two TM isoforms, which principally alter cardiac relaxation properties. High levels of β-TM lead to severe cardiac abnormalities, which culminate in lethality within 10–14 days of expression. In this study, we have successfully extended the survival of these high expression TG mice by the down-regulation of the α-MHC promoter, which drives the transgene expression. Results presented here provide the first example of rescuing a lethal cardiac phenotype by modulation of the α-MHC promoter through two thyroid regulatory elements. This down-regulation is accomplished by disrupting thyroid hormone synthesis by PTU administration. Ventricular expression of α-MHC is dependent upon thyroid hormone binding to thyroid hormone regulatory elements located within the 5′ regulatory region. These thyroid hormone regulatory elements are highly conserved transcriptional regulatory elements that assist in the modulation of α-MHC gene transcription during development of the heart (15Flink I. Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11233-11237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Subramaniam A. Gulick J. Neumann J. Knotts S. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4331-4336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inducing hypothyroidism using PTU decreases the transcriptional activity of the α-MHC promoter, coupled with a concomitant increase in β-MHC promoter activity (17Ojamaa K. Klemperer J. MacGilvray S. Klein I. Samarel A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In our study, removal of PTU from the diet and re-expression of the β-TM transgene leads to severe cardiac abnormalities, which result in lethality. Previous studies have established that thyroid hormone influences myocardial contractility through several distinct mechanisms, including regulation of gene expression and interactions with the sympathetic nervous system (18Polikar R. Burger A. Scherrer U. Nicod P. Circulation. 1993; 87: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In hypothyroidism, myosin isozymes are predominantly present in slower contracting forms (i.e.β-MHC), as well as decreased activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, which affects the velocity of diastolic relaxation (19Hoh J. McGiath P. Hale P. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1978; 10: 1053-1076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Also, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, which stimulates sympathetic outflow within the central nervous system, is elevated in hypothyroidism (20Morley J. Tuck M. Mayes D. Horm. Res. 1981; 14: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Mattila J. Bunag R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: R1464-R1471PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of thyroid hormones on stimulation of protein synthesis in cardiac tissue appears to be secondary to the effect of protein synthesis on hemodynamics and cardiac work (9Katzeff H. Ojamaa K. Klein I. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E63-E67PubMed Google Scholar). Certain cardiac functional measures appear unaffected by hypothyroidism, including left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end diastolic dimension and end systolic wall stress (19Hoh J. McGiath P. Hale P. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1978; 10: 1053-1076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). This may be the reason that results from our investigation showed that there were no significant changes in whole animal cardiac performance for peak filling rate or fractional shortening between control mice on a normal or PTU diet. Interestingly, heart rate measurements in this study of wild type control mice were decreased in PTU-treated animals, which is similar to the result found with intact closed-chest measurements of murine cardiac function using in situ Millar transducers (22Lorenz J. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1137-H1146PubMed Google Scholar). With PTU, the heart rate is similar in both NTG and TG mice, since the transgene is shut off, whereas in the “switched diet” condition, the hemodynamic load on the heart may be increased due to the significant β-TM expression. Ventricular diastole is composed of ventricular relaxation and the left atrioventricular pressure gradient. Although there was no difference in filling rates between wild type and TG mice when mice were given PTU-enriched diets, when the mice were shifted to a normal diet, the peak filling rate was greater in wild type than TG mice. The decrease in peak filling rate cannot be accounted for entirely by the slow heart rate in transgenic versus wild type mice, since the peak filling rate in TG switched was less than the peak filling rate in wild type PTU, despite similar heart rates. Thus, these data suggest that left ventricular relaxation is impaired in the mice producing the excessive β-TM. The increased heart rate for wild type mice on the normal diet is also significantly higher than that of wild type mice treated with PTU, which may be reflective of changes in myosin isozymes and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, which are transcriptionally regulated by T3 levels. We speculate that the inability of the TG mice to increase their heart rate after the removal of PTU reflects the re-expression of the β-TM transgene and its influence on sarcomeric function and diastole, which may act to decrease ventricular wall compliance and impair relaxation. The usage of conditional expression systems can play a unique role in the assessment of exogenous protein function. For bacterial and cell culture expression systems, inducible promoters can be employed to transcriptionally regulate expression of genes. Regulated mammalianin vivo expression systems are more limited, with thecre-loxsystem being operative but technically complicated to establish. This current study utilizes the extensively used α-MHC promoter to drive transcription of a transgene for cardiac tissue-specific expression. Since this promoter is controlled by thyroid regulatory elements, the hypothyroid condition will down-regulate its activity. Although hypothyroidism affects the expression of numerous genes and hormonal systems, our ability to induce this condition through PTU allows us to rescue the high copy β-TM mouse for survival past its normal life span of 10–14 days to at least 8 weeks. Although one must be judicious in the analyses, this ability to manipulate the α-MHC promoter is invaluable for conducting analyses past the newborn developmental stage and may serve to further research on other lethal phenotypes that result from overexpression of α-MHC-driven transgenes.

https://openalex.org/W1928814219,"Rat kallikrein-binding protein (KBP), a member of the serpin family, is a tissue kallikrein inhibitor. It has been shown to be a potential pathogenic factor of diabetic retinopathy and may play a role in animal development and growth. To determine whether reduced KBP expression is involved in retarded animal growth, we examined the in vivo effect of growth hormone (GH) deficiency on the expression of KBP in the Lewis dwarf (dw/dw). We found that serum levels of functionally active KBP were reduced in the dwarf rat (P < 0.05) as determined by complex formation assay between serum KBP and (125)I-labeled rat tissue kallikrein. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that KBP levels were significantly reduced in the serum of the dwarf rat compared to the Lewis rat (213.8 ng/ml vs. 413.8 ng/ml, n = 4, P < 0.01). The decreased KBP levels were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Moreover, treatment of the dwarf rat with recombinant human GH for 4 wk resulted in a significant increase in KBP activity (P < 0.01) and serum KBP levels compared with the untreated dwarf rat (549.8 ng/ml, n = 5, vs. 213.8 ng/ml, n = 4, P < 0.02). Northern blot analysis and densitometry showed that liver KBP mRNA levels were reduced by fivefold in the dwarf rat compared to the Lewis rat and the decrease was reversed by the GH treatment. These results indicate that the KBP levels are regulated at the RNA level. Furthermore, in vitro studies using cultured rat hepatocytes showed that GH may have a direct regulatory effect on KBP expression since KBP levels increased in the conditioned media of cells treated with GH. These results demonstrated that KBP is reduced in the genetic dwarf rat and is restored to normal by GH; therefore, KBP is a GH-dependent protein and may be a new target for studying the mechanism of pathological animal growth."
