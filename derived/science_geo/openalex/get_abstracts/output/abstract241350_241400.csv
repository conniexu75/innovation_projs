https://openalex.org/W2084336412,"Inferior parietal lobule (IPL) neurons were studied when monkeys performed motor acts embedded in different actions and when they observed similar acts done by an experimenter. Most motor IPL neurons coding a specific act (e.g., grasping) showed markedly different activations when this act was part of different actions (e.g., for eating or for placing). Many motor IPL neurons also discharged during the observation of acts done by others. Most responded differentially when the same observed act was embedded in a specific action. These neurons fired during the observation of an act, before the beginning of the subsequent acts specifying the action. Thus, these neurons not only code the observed motor act but also allow the observer to understand the agent's intentions."

Such projects have increased exponentially over the past decade with more than a billion dollars spent annually since 1990. Most are intended to enhance water quality, manage riparian zones, improve in-stream habitat, allow fish passage, and stabilize stream banks. Only 10% of project records document any form of project monitoring, and little if any of this information is either appropriate or available for assessing the ecological effectiveness of restoration activities."

Through a cooperative interaction, Sox2 and Oct4 have previously been described to drive pluripotent-specific expression of a number of genes. We now extend the list of Sox2-Oct4 target genes to include Nanog. Within the Nanog proximal promoter, we identify a composite sox-oct cis-regulatory element essential for Nanog pluripotent transcription. This element is conserved over 250 million years of cumulative evolution within the eutherian mammals. A Nanog proximal promoter-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) reporter transgene recapitulates endogenous Nanog mRNA expression in embryonic stem cells and their differentiated derivatives. Sox2 and Oct4 interaction with the Nanog promoter was confirmed through mutagenesis and in vitro binding assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that the Sox2-Oct4 heterodimer forms more efficiently on the composite element within Nanog than the similar element within Fgf4. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that Oct4 and Sox2 bind to the Nanog promoter in living mouse and human embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, by specific knockdown of Oct4 and Sox2 mRNA by RNA interference in embryonic stem cells, we provide genetic evidence for a link between Oct4, Sox2, and the Nanog promoter. These studies extend the understanding of the pluripotent genetic regulatory network within which the Sox2-Oct4 complex are at the top of the regulatory hierarchy.

Nanog is a homeobox-containing transcription factor with an essential function in maintaining the pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass and in the derivation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) 1The abbreviations used are: ESC, embryonic stem cell; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; RA, retinoic acid; RNAi, RNA interference; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ES, embryonic stem; PSBP, pluripotent cell-specific Sox element-binding protein. from these (1Mitsui K.

Furthermore, overexpression of Nanog is capable of maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewing characteristics of ESCs under what normally would be differentiation-inducing culture conditions (2Chambers I.

Concomitant with this essential function in pluripotent cell maintenance is its restricted expression pattern. Nanog transcripts first appear in the inner cells of the morula prior to blastocyst formation (1Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S.

Gene Expr. Patterns. 2003; 3: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and are no longer detectable at implantation. Expression of Nanog reappears in the proximal epiblast at embryonic day 6 and remains restricted to the epiblast as development progresses (4Hart A.H. Hartley L. Ibrahim M. Robb L. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 230: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The factors controlling expression of this gene have yet to be described. The POU domain-containing Oct4 and the HMG domain-containing Sox2 are two other transcription factors known to be essential for normal pluripotent cell development and maintenance (5Nichols J.

Although both have independent roles in determining other cell types (6Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H. Perez L. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R.

Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar), at least part of their function in pluripotent cells is via a synergistic interaction between the two to drive transcription of target genes. Currently known targets of Sox2-Oct4 synergy are Fgf4, Utf1, and Fbx15, as well as Sox2 and Pou5f1 (the gene encoding Oct4) themselves (8Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L.

Each of these target genes has a composite element containing an octamer and a sox binding site. Our recent characterization of a genetic link between the Sox2-Oct4 complex and Sox2 and Pou5f1 expression, as well as their in vivo binding to these genes in mouse and human ESCs (12Chew J-L. Loh Y.-H. Zhang W. Chen X. Tam W.-L. Yeap L.-S. Li P. Ang Y.-S. Lim B. Robson P. Ng H.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar), suggests that this complex is at the top of the pluripotent cell genetic regulatory network. In this study, we were interested in identifying the cis-regulatory module responsible for the pluripotent-specific expression of Nanog. Nanog represents the first known transcription factor appearing after compaction, and specific to the inner cells of the morula, both Oct4 and Sox2 are expressed prior to compaction in all blastomeres (6Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H. Perez L. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar, 14Palmieri S.L. Peter W. Hess H. Schöler H.R. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). As the expression of Nanog precisely corresponds to the pluripotent phenotype, we reasoned that a molecular understanding of the regulation of this gene would provide further insight into pluripotency. Here we describe a cis-regulatory module conserved throughout the eutherian mammals that is capable of recapitulating endogenous Nanog expression; at the core of this module is a composite oct-sox element necessary for pluripotent expression. Sequence Analysis and Promoter Constructs—All sequences were from public data bases at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and/or www.ensembl.org. A genomic sequence corresponding to Homo sapiens NANOG (15Booth H.A. Holland P.W. Genomics. 2004; 84: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was used. Bos taurus (cow) and Loxodonta africana (elephant) sequences were constructed from trace files available at NCBI. Mus musculus (mouse) and Rattus norvegicus (rat) sequences were from the respective compiled genomic sequences. The promoter region of mouse Nanog was amplified from genomic DNA. Primers for amplification, with restriction sites for cloning purposes indicated in lowercase, were: forward, 5′-CGCgtcgacTAAAGTGAAATGAGGTAAAGCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGCggatccGGAAAGATCATAGAAAGAAGAG-3′. The amplified product was cloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega) and pEGFP1 (Clontech) vectors and sequence-verified. Embryonic Stem Cell Culture and Reporter Lines—E14 mouse ESCs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20% fetal bovine serum, 1× non-essential amino acids, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and an aliquot of recombinant LIF conditioned medium. ESCs were stably transfected with the NanogEGFP construct using a standard protocol, and individual colonies were picked after selection with 300 μg/ml G418 for 10 days with cells grown on neomycin-resistant mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Differentiation of ESCs was by withdrawal of LIF-conditioned medium, spontaneous differentiation into embryoid bodies, or the addition of retinoic acid. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Quantitation of endogenous Nanog and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter expression was by reverse transcription-PCR analyses in real time using the ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Proligo-synthesized primer-probe sets for these were as follows: Nanog forward, 5′-GGTTGAAGACTAGCAATGGTCTGA-3′; Nanog reverse, 5′-TGCAATGGATGCTGGGATACTC-3′; Nanog probe, 5′-TTCAGAAGGGCTCAGCACCA-3′; EGFP forward, 5′-CGACAACCACTACCTGAGCAC-3′; EGFP reverse, 5′-TCGTCCATGCCGAGAGTGAT-3′; EGFP probe, 5′-CGGCGGCGGTCACGAACTCCAGC-3′. Expression was normalized to a β-actin control (Applied Biosystems). The human ESC line HUES-6 (obtained from Doug Melton, Harvard University) was passaged according to Cowan et al. (16Cowan C.A. Klimanskaya I. McMahon J. Atienza J. Witmyer J. Zucker J.P. Wang S. Morton C.C. McMahon A.P. Powers D. Melton D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assays—F9 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dul-becco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Invitrogen), 15% standard fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. DNA transfection was by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the supplied protocol. A Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-TK from Promega) was co-transfected as an internal control. Cells were harvested after 24 h, and the luciferase activity of the lysate was measured with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using the Centro LB960 96-well luminometer (Berthold Technologies). At a minimum, transfections were done in duplicate and on two independent occasions. Reporter plasmids were modified using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) to incorporate 3-bp mutations which were subsequently verified by sequencing. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from E14 mouse ESCs grown on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeders using the method of Dignam et al. (17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with modifications as described. Cells were washed and harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 5 pellet volumes of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2,10mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in 2 pellet volumes of buffer A and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 0.6 pellet volumes of buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 30 min. After centrifugation supernatants were dialyzed against dialysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.83 mm EDTA, 1.66 mm dithiothreitol, 1% protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C for 2 h. Extracts were then stored at -80 °C. For EMSA, double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (Proligo) labeled with cy5 at the 5′ termini of both strands were used. Sense strand sequences were as follows: FOS, 5′-TTTAAGTATCCCATTAGCATCCAAACAAAGAGTTTTC-3′; NOS, 5′-CTTACAGCTTCTTTTGCATTACAATGTCCATGGTGGA-3′, NmOS, 5′-CTTACAGCTTCTTTCAAATTACAATGTCCATGGTGGA-3′; NOmS, 5′-CTTACAGCTTCTTTTGCATTAACCTGTCCATGGTGGA-3′; NmOmS, 5′-CTTACAGCTTCTTTCAAATTAACCTGTCCATGGTGGA-3′; NNS, 5′-CTGCAGGTGGGATTAACTGTGAATTCA-3′. For DNA binding reactions, 2 μl (∼16 μg) of nuclear extract was added to a 10-μl reaction (final) containing 50 nm cy5 oligonucleotide and 5 μg of poly(dGdC) (Amersham Biosciences). The final binding buffer composition was 60% dialysis buffer. Where specified, 1 μm unlabeled double-stranded competitor was also included prior to the addition of nuclear extracts. Binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Where specified, antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added after the initial incubation for a further 20 min as follows: 2 μl of anti-Oct4 (sc-9081x) and anti-JunB (sc-46x) or 8 μl of anti-Sox2 (sc-17320) and anti-Sox4 (sc-17326). Binding reactions were resolved on pre-run 6% native PAGE gels (18.5 × 20 cm) in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA for 2 h at 300 V. Gels were imaged directly in glass plates using an Amersham Biosciences Typhoon 9140 PhosphorImager. EMSA performed with mouse embryonic fibroblast feeders alone produced no significant mobility shifts, indicating that they did not contribute to the observed protein-DNA complexes. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays with E14 mouse ESCs were carried out as described (18Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods (Orlando). 2002; 26: 48-56Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and formaldehyde was inactivated by the addition of 125 mm glycine. Chromatin extracts containing DNA fragments with an average size of 500 bp were immunoprecipitated using Oct4 (N19) or Sox2 (Y17) polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a Sox2 (AB5603) polyclonal antibody (Chemicon). For all ChIP experiments, quantitative PCR analyses were performed in real time using the ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems) as described (19Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Relative occupancy values were calculated by determining the apparent immunoprecipitate efficiency (ratios of the amount of immunoprecipitated DNA over that of the input sample) and normalized to the level observed at a control region, which was defined as 1.0. Primer pairs were as follows: 1, 5′-GGCAAACTTTGAACTTGGGATGTGGAAATA-3′, 5′-CTCAGCCGTCTAAGCAATGGAAGAAGAAAT-3′; 2, 5′-GAGGATGCCCCCTAAGCTTTCCCTCCC-3′, 5′-CCTCCTACCCTACCCACCCCCTATTCTCCC-3′; 3, 5′-GGGTCACCTTACAGCTTCTTTTGCATTA-3′, 5′-GGCTCAAGGCGATAGATTTAAAGGGTAG-3′; 4, 5′-GGTGATACGTTGGCCTTCTAGTCTGAA-3′, 5′-GGGCAAATTGCAAACTAACTGTATAACCTC-3′. RNAi Analysis—E14 mouse ESCs were seeded into 96-well plates at 20,000–30,000 cells/well density (with primary embryonic fibroblasts at 1000 cells/well) 1 day prior to transfection. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000. 50 ng of Nanog-pGL3 (firefly luciferase construct), 150 ng of pSuper or pSuper_RNAi (for further details, see Ref. 12Chew J-L. Loh Y.-H. Zhang W. Chen X. Tam W.-L. Yeap L.-S. Li P. Ang Y.-S. Lim B. Robson P. Ng H.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar), and phRLSV40 (normalization control expressing Renilla luciferase) were transfected. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were selected for puromycin resistance for 2 further days prior to the luciferase activity being measured. The sequences used for RNAi were: Sox2, 5′-GAAGGAGCACCCGGATTA-3′; Oct4, 5′-GAAGGATGTGGTTCGAGT-3′. Sequence Comparisons Identify Conserved Non-coding Sequences—As Nanog is expressed in both mouse and human pluripotent cells, we reasoned the pluripotent transcription of this gene is maintained through the functional conservation of cis-regulatory elements, and concomitantly, the location and sequence of these elements would be conserved through purifying selection. Therefore we extracted mouse and human Nanog genomic sequences from the public databases. A pair-wise alignment of the mouse and human gene sequences was generated utilizing the Vista on-line tool at LBL Berkley (20Mayor C. Brudno M. Schwartz J.R. Poliakov A. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Pachter L.S. Dubchak I. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1046-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). We aligned the genomic region from 10 kb upstream of the most 5′ mouse Nanog EST to 10 kb downstream of the most 3′ EST. Peaks of sequence similarity corresponded to the four exons of Nanog, most significantly in the homeodomain-encoding exons 2 and 3 (data not shown). Of the 26.1 kb of non-coding sequence that we compared, the only area of significant sequence conservation was a 200-bp region immediately upstream of the 5′-most EST. This focused our attention on this region for further study as the sequence conservation suggested functionally conserved cis-regulatory elements. Proximal Promoter Is Sufficient to Recapitulate Endogenous Expression—To functionally test this conserved proximal promoter region, we generated stably transfected mouse ESC lines with a plasmid vector containing the mouse sequence from -289 to +117 (relative to the transcription start site) driving the expression of an EGFP. We had defined the Nanog transcription start site as the position of the furthest 5′ public EST; this has since been defined as the predominant transcription start site (4Hart A.H. Hartley L. Ibrahim M. Robb L. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 230: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). After G418 selection for stably transfected ES lines, the majority of colonies fluoresced green, indicating that this region of the Nanog promoter is indeed active in pluripotent cells (Fig. 1B). A number of these NanogEGFP colonies were selected for further analysis. In addition to the pluripotent-positive cis-regulatory elements within this promoter fragment, we were interested in determining whether this promoter contained sufficient cis-regulatory information to down-regulate transcription upon ESC differentiation as occurs with endogenous Nanog. Therefore we compared EGFP expression in the undifferentiated NanogEGFP ESCs to their differentiated derivatives (Fig. 1). Retinoic acid (RA), a strong inducer of ESC differentiation, drastically reduced EGFP expression after 3 days of treatment (Fig. 1, E and F). Culturing NanogEGFP cells in the absence of LIF, a less aggressive differentiation protocol than RA, reduced EGFP expression noticeably after 3 days of culture (Fig. 1, C and D). This expression pattern was seen in three independent NanogEGFP lines. To directly compare transcripts from this NanogEGFP to that of the endogenous Nanog itself, we used real-time PCR (Fig. 1G). The EGFP expression closely paralleled that of the endogenous Nanog as indicated in comparisons of embryoid bodies of 2, 4, 6, and 8 days as well as 2 and 4 days after induction with RA or exclusion of LIF from the medium. In addition, the percentage of EGFP-positive cells, as determined by FACS analysis, in this NanogEGFP reporter line under differing differentiation conditions correlated well with endogenous Nanog expression (Fig. 1G). For instance, the undifferentiated ESCs were 74% EGFP-positive, whereas the 8-day embryoid bodies and 4-day RA-treated cells were 3 and 9% EGFP-positive, respectively. These results indicate that this 406-bp fragment of Nanog contains sufficient cis-regulatory information to recapitulate endogenous Nanog expression, at least as tested in an in vitro ESC-based system. Phylogenetic Footprinting Identifies an Oct-Sox Composite Element—We next aimed to identify the specific cis-regulatory elements responsible for driving pluripotent expression. Generating an alignment of the proximal promoter region from a diverse range of mammals enabled us to identify a strong phylogenetic footprint. A very conservative estimate of the divergence time between the five species used in constructing this alignment (12 million years ago for the mouse-rat split and 60 million years ago between each of the mouse-rat, human, cow, and elephant) provides a cumulative 252 million years of purifying selection to identify a footprint. The greatest stretch of sequence conservation was over a 94-bp region located from position -212 to -119 relative to the Nanog transcription start site; within this, 64 positions were invariant (Fig. 2A). A 16-bp stretch represented the longest uninterrupted invariant sequence and, intriguingly, within this was a 15-bp oct-sox composite element (Fig. 2A) similar to those identified in and known to be functional for pluripotent expression of Fgf4, Utf1, Sox2, Pou5f1, and Fbx15 (8Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 9Nishimoto M. Fukushima A. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). The position of the sox and oct elements relative to each other is the same in all five of these genes, which is indicative of the specific protein-protein contacts between the corresponding transcription factors (Sox2 and Oct4) known to bind this composite element (21Reményi A. Lins K. Nissen L.J. Reinbold R. Schöler H.R. Wilmanns M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2048-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 22Williams Jr., D.C. Cai M. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Similar to Utf1, Sox2, Pou5f1, and Fbx15, the sox and oct cis-elements in Nanog are immediately adjacent to one another, whereas in Fgf4, 3 bases separate the two elements. Such strong purifying selection at numerous positions within the Nanog promoter suggests a functional role for these positions in the regulation of transcription. Some of these positions, such as the oct-sox composite element, are likely to be important in pluripotent expression, whereas others may represent cis-regulatory elements functional in the post-implantation expression of Nanog. Functional Analysis of the Conserved cis-Regulatory Module—To study the role of specific sequence elements in the activation of pluripotent cell transcription, we constructed a series of luciferase reporter constructs and transfected these into F9 teratocarcinoma cells, a mouse cell line representative of the pluripotent phenotype. The wild-type 406-bp promoter (-289 to +117) from the NanogEGFP construct had significant transcriptional activity in this system; its activity was set arbitrarily to 100% for all further comparisons (Fig. 2B, wt). A shorter region (-230 to +63) still inclusive of the conserved sequence in Fig. 2A had ∼130% activity of the original promoter. This suggests a potential negative regulatory element contained within the -289 to -231 region that is excluded from this shorter promoter but also indicates the presence of pluripotent activator elements within the -230 to +63 span. To test the orientation dependence of the conserved module, we made identical constructs but with a region (spanning -289 to -94) containing this module in either forward or reverse orientation relative to the immediate proximal promoter (-93 to +117). Restriction enzyme sites introduced when creating these two constructs slightly altered the sequence from that of the wild-type control. 79% of wild-type activity was maintained in the forward construct, and 48% was maintained in the reverse construct. These luciferase data are summarized from a total of four different experiments with three wells of cells/construct/experiment. Although significant transcriptional activity was maintained in the reverse orientation, it did consistently show a lower transcriptional activity than the forward (wild-type) orientation, which suggests that the function of this conserved module has subtle orientation effects. The Oct and Sox cis-Elements Are Required for Nanog Promoter Activity—To test their effect on pluripotent transcriptional activity, 3-bp mutations were generated within this core conserved region (Fig. 2A). The M2, M3, and M4 mutations, cumulatively covering seven invariable positions of the 9 bp they span, did not greatly alter transcriptional activity (Fig. 2B). The M3 mutation did not decrease promoter activity, and the M2 and M4 mutations dropped luciferase activity down to ∼65% of wild-type. These subtle effects on promoter activity may indeed be significant in the context of the in vivo pluripotent cell. It is also possible that these positions covered by the M2, M3, and M4 mutations have some other functional role (as they are conserved) other than activation of transcription in pluripotent cells, possibly in the repression of expression in a Nanog-negative cell type or activation of transcription in Nanog-positive cells that occur later in development. As anticipated, mutations affecting the oct and sox elements dropped promoter activity to 17 and 15%, respectively (Fig. 2B); additionally, when both of these sites were mutated in the same construct, activity was reduced to 6% of wild-type. A conserved sequence 20 bp 5′ to the oct-sox composite element also had a very drastic effect on transcription (Fig. 2B, M1), lowering it to 22% of wild type. This suggests that the oct and sox cis-regulatory elements are not the only elements important in pluripotent transcription of Nanog and highlights the utility of phylogenetic footprinting for identifying functionally important cis-regulatory elements. However, our subsequent analysis focused on the sox and oct elements themselves. Sox2 and Oct4 Bind the Composite cis-Element—To determine whether Oct4 and Sox2 were able to recognize the composite element within the Nanog promoter, we performed EMSA using a 37-bp probe (NOS) spanning this sequence combined with nuclear extracts from mouse ESCs. The Fgf4 enhancer element (FOS) known to bind Oct4 and Sox2 in EMSA (see Ref. 8Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. Four major protein-DNA complexes (A–D) were observed using the NOS probe (Fig. 3). Similar complexes appeared on the FOS probe with one additional complex (E). The addition of antibodies to either Oct4 or Sox2 resulted in supershifts of complexes A and C or C and E, respectively, indicating that complex A represents binding of the Oct4 monomer; complex E represents the Sox2 monomer, and complex C represents the Oct4/Sox2 heterodimer. Antibody specificity was confirmed as antibodies against JunB or Sox4 had no effect. Significantly, Sox2 in E14 extracts was not observed binding as a monomer to NOS. Following transient transfection of Sox2 into NIH 3T3 cells, we observed that Sox2 did bind NOS as a monomer in EMSA (not shown), indicating that Sox2 is capable of binding the Nanog element in the absence of Oct4. This suggests that all available Sox2 in the E14 extracts binds as a heterodimer with the more abundant Oct4 and that heterodimer formation is favored on the Nanog element relative to the Fgf4 element. This is corroborated by the observation that the ratio of the intensity of the heterodimer complex (C) to that of the Oct4 monomer complex (A) was consistently greater on NOS as compared with FOS (Fig. 3). We also observed a consistently faster mobility of the Oct4/Sox2 heterodimer binding NOS as compared with that binding FOS. This is compatible with the idea that a more closed conformation could occur on the NOS sequence due to the lack of nucleotides separating the oct and sox elements, as occurs in the FOS sequence."

Although TLRs are clearly involved in the detection of bacteria and viruses, relatively little is known about their function in the innate response to eukaryotic microorganisms. Here we identify a profilin-like molecule from the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii that generates a potent interleukin-12 (IL-12) response in murine DCs that is dependent on myeloid differentiation factor 88. T. gondii profilin activates DCs through TLR11 and is the first chemically defined ligand for this TLR. Moreover, TLR11 is required in vivo for parasite-induced IL-12 production and optimal resistance to infection, thereby establishing a role for the receptor in host recognition of protozoan pathogens."

This imbalance is confirmed by precise measurements of increasing ocean heat content over the past 10 years. Implications include (i) the expectation of additional global warming of about 0.6°C without further change of atmospheric composition; (ii) the confirmation of the climate system's lag in responding to forcings, implying the need for anticipatory actions to avoid any specified level of climate change; and (iii) the likelihood of acceleration of ice sheet disintegration and sea level rise."

Measurements of the mode's dispersion curve show that it correctly approaches the predicted asymptotic frequency; the curve also agrees well with that derived from a computer simulation. Modeling of the field distribution on resonance provides evidence of strong localization of the electric field at the interface and substantial power flow along the interface, thus verifying the surface plasmon–like nature of the mode."
https://openalex.org/W2097594050,"The design of a human immunodeficiency virus–1 (HIV-1) immunogen that can induce broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies is a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine development. Although rare human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) exist that broadly neutralize HIV-1, HIV-1 envelope immunogens do not induce these antibody specificities. Here we demonstrate that the two most broadly reactive HIV-1 envelope gp41 human mAbs, 2F5 and 4E10, are polyspecific autoantibodies reactive with the phospholipid cardiolipin. Thus, current HIV-1 vaccines may not induce these types of antibodies because of autoantigen mimicry of the conserved membrane-proximal epitopes of the virus. These results may have important implications for generating effective neutralizing antibody responses by using HIV-1 vaccines."

These perturbations must be compensated for, especially when they occur during embryonic pattern formation. Complex chemical reaction networks displaying spatiotemporal dynamics have been controlled and understood by perturbing their environment in space and time1,2,3. Here, we apply this approach using microfluidics to investigate the robust network in Drosophila melanogaster that compensates for variation in the Bicoid morphogen gradient. We show that the compensation system can counteract the effects of extremely unnatural environmental conditions—a temperature step—in which the anterior and posterior halves of the embryo are developing at different temperatures and thus at different rates. Embryonic patterning was normal under this condition, suggesting that a simple reciprocal gradient system is not the mechanism of compensation. Time-specific reversals of the temperature step narrowed down the critical period for compensation to between 65 and 100 min after onset of embryonic development. The microfluidic technology used here may prove useful to future studies, as it allows spatial and temporal regulation of embryonic development."

Here we present the use of low-temperature processes to integrate high-performance multi-nanowire transistors into logical inverters and fast ring oscillators on glass substrates. As well as potentially enabling powerful electronics to permeate all aspects of modern life, this advance could find application in devices such as low-cost radio-frequency tags and fully integrated high-refresh-rate displays."

The observed switching energy density is very low, suggesting that the switch might operate at the single-photon level with system optimization. This approach opens the possibility of realizing a single-photon switch for quantum information networks and for improving transparent optical telecommunication networks."

https://openalex.org/W2134866318,"Cell-cell signaling roles for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in response to growth factors/cytokines in nonphagocytic cells are not well defined. In this study, we show that fibroblasts isolated from lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) generate extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in response to the multifunctional cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). In contrast, TGF-beta1 stimulation of small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) does not result in detectable levels of extracellular H2O2. IPF fibroblasts independently stimulated with TGF-beta1 induce loss of viability and death of overlying SAECs when cocultured in a compartmentalized Transwell system. These effects on SAECs are inhibited by the addition of catalase to the coculture system or by the selective enzymatic blockade of H2O2 production by IPF fibroblasts. IPF fibroblasts heterogeneously express alpha-smooth muscle actin stress fibers, a marker of myofibroblast differentiation. Cellular localization of H2O2 by a fluorescent-labeling strategy demonstrated that extracellular secretion of H2O2 is specific to the myofibroblast phenotype. Thus, myofibroblast secretion of H2O2 functions as a diffusible death signal for lung epithelial cells. This novel mechanism for intercellular ROS signaling may be important in physiological/pathophysiological processes characterized by regenerating epithelial cells and activated myofibroblasts."

The formation of clathrin-coated vesicles occurs continuously in non-dividing cells5, but is shut down during mitosis6, when clathrin concentrates at the spindle apparatus7,8. Here, we show that clathrin stabilizes fibres of the mitotic spindle to aid congression of chromosomes. Clathrin bound to the spindle directly by the amino-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. Depletion of clathrin heavy chain using RNA interference prolonged mitosis; kinetochore fibres were destabilized, leading to defective congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate and persistent activation of the spindle checkpoint. Normal mitosis was rescued by clathrin triskelia but not the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain, indicating that stabilization of kinetochore fibres was dependent on the unique structure of clathrin. The importance of clathrin for normal mitosis may be relevant to understanding human cancers that involve gene fusions of clathrin heavy chain."

https://openalex.org/W2124648171,"On 27 December last year, SGR1806–20, a soft γ-ray repeater in Sagittarius, released a giant flare that has been called the brightest explosion ever recorded. SGRs are X-ray stars that sporadically emit low-energy γ-ray bursts. They are thought to be magnetars: neutron stars with observable emissions powered by magnetic dissipation. Five papers in this issue report initial and follow-up observations of this event. The data are remarkable: for instance in a fifth of a second, the flare released as much energy as the Sun radiates in a quarter of a million years. Such power can be explained by catastrophic global crust failure and magnetic reconnection on a magnetar. Releasing a hundred times the energy of the only two previous SGR giant flares, this may have been a once-in-a-lifetime event for astronomers, and for the star itself. Soft γ-ray repeaters (SGRs) are ‘magnetars’, a small class of slowly spinning neutron stars with extreme surface magnetic fields, B ≈ 1015 gauss (refs 1, 2–3). On 27 December 2004, a giant flare4 was detected from the magnetar SGR 1806 - 20 (ref. 2), only the third such event recorded5,6. This burst of energy was detected by a variety of instruments7,8 and even caused an ionospheric disturbance in the Earth's upper atmosphere that was recorded around the globe9. Here we report the detection of a fading radio afterglow produced by this outburst, with a luminosity 500 times larger than the only other detection of a similar source10. From day 6 to day 19 after the flare from SGR 1806 - 20, a resolved, linearly polarized, radio nebula was seen, expanding at approximately a quarter of the speed of light. To create this nebula, at least 4 × 1043 ergs of energy must have been emitted by the giant flare in the form of magnetic fields and relativistic particles."
https://openalex.org/W2151814706,"Global gene expression profiling is used to generate novel insight into a variety of disease states. Such studies yield a bewildering number of data points, making it a challenge to validate which genes specifically contribute to a disease phenotype. Aerobic exercise training represents a plausible model for identification of molecular mechanisms that cause metabolic-related changes in human skeletal muscle. We carried out the first transcriptome-wide characterization of human skeletal muscle responses to 6 wk of supervised aerobic exercise training in 8 sedentary volunteers. Biopsy samples before and after training allowed us to identify approximately 470 differentially regulated genes using the Affymetrix U95 platform (80 individual hybridization steps). Gene ontology analysis indicated that extracellular matrix and calcium binding gene families were most up-regulated after training. An electronic reanalysis of a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) transcript expression dataset allowed us to identify approximately 90 genes modulated in a nearly identical fashion to that observed in the endurance exercise dataset. Trophoblast noncoding RNA, an interfering RNA species, was the singular exception-being up-regulated by exercise and down-regulated in DMD. The common overlap between gene expression datasets may be explained by enhanced alpha7beta1 integrin signaling, and specific genes in this signaling pathway were up-regulated in both datasets. In contrast to these common features, OXPHOS gene expression is subdued in DMD yet elevated by exercise, indicating that more than one major mechanism must exist in human skeletal muscle to sense activity and therefore regulate gene expression. Exercise training modulated diabetes-related genes, suggesting our dataset may contain additional and novel gene expression changes relevant for the anti-diabetic properties of exercise. In conclusion, gene expression profiling after endurance exercise training identified a range of processes responsible for the physiological remodeling of human skeletal muscle tissue, many of which were similarly regulated in DMD. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that numerous genes previously suggested as being important for the DMD disease phenotype may principally reflect compensatory integrin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2146279021,"The massive flare of 27 December 2004 from the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1806-20, a possible magnetar, saturated almost all gamma-ray detectors, meaning that the profile of the pulse was poorly characterized. An accurate profile is essential to determine physically what was happening at the source. Here we report the unsaturated gamma-ray profile for the first 600 ms of the flare, with a time resolution of 5.48 ms. The peak of the profile (of the order of 10(7) photons cm(-2) s(-1)) was reached approximately 50 ms after the onset of the flare, and was then followed by a gradual decrease with superposed oscillatory modulations possibly representing repeated energy injections with approximately 60-ms intervals. The implied total energy is comparable to the stored magnetic energy in a magnetar (approximately 10(47) erg) based on the dipole magnetic field intensity (approximately 10(15) G), suggesting either that the energy release mechanism was extremely efficient or that the interior magnetic field is much stronger than the external dipole field."
https://openalex.org/W2101230829,"Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is the principal component of neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is derived from beta amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. Beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) has been identified as the major beta-secretase. BACE2 is the homolog of BACE1. The BACE2 gene is on chromosome 21 and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. However, the function of BACE2 in Abeta generation is controversial. Some studies have shown that BACE2 cleaved APP at the beta-site whereas other studies showed it cleaved around the alpha-secretase site. To elucidate the involvement of BACE2 in AD pathogenesis, we compared BACE2 and BACE1 gene regulation and their functions in Abeta generation. We cloned and functionally characterized the human BACE2 promoter. The BACE2 gene is controlled by a TATA-less promoter. Though Sp1 can regulate both BACE1 and BACE2 genes, comparative sequence analysis and transcription factor prediction showed little similarity between the two promoters. BACE1 increased APP cleavage at the beta-site and Abeta production whereas BACE2 did not. Overexpression of BACE2 significantly increased sAPP levels in conditioned media but markedly reduced Abeta production. Knockdown of BACE2 resulted in increased APP C83. Our data indicate that despite being homologous in amino acid sequence, BACE2 and BACE1 have distinct functions and transcriptional regulation. BACE2 is not a beta-secretase, but processes APP within the Abeta domain at a site downstream of the alpha-secretase cleavage site. Our data argue against BACE2 being involved in the formation of neuritic plaques in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2058437982,"It was established over a decade ago that the remarkable high-energy transients known as soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) are located in our Galaxy and originate from neutron stars with intense (< or = 10(15)G) magnetic fields-so-called 'magnetars'. On 27 December 2004, a giant flare with a fluence exceeding 0.3 erg cm(-2) was detected from SGR 1806-20. Here we report the detection of a fading radio counterpart to this event. We began a monitoring programme from 0.2 to 250 GHz and obtained a high-resolution 21-cm radio spectrum that traces the intervening interstellar neutral hydrogen clouds. Analysis of the spectrum yields the first direct distance measurement of SGR 1806-20: the source is located at a distance greater than 6.4 kpc and we argue that it is nearer than 9.8 kpc. If correct, our distance estimate lowers the total energy of the explosion and relaxes the demands on theoretical models. The energetics and the rapid decay of the radio source are not compatible with the afterglow model that is usually invoked for gamma-ray bursts. Instead, we suggest that the rapidly decaying radio emission arises from the debris ejected during the explosion."

However, a pathogenic role for CCL2 has not been confirmed, and there is no established model for the effects of chronic CCL2 expression on resident and recruited CNS cells. We report that aged (>6 months) transgenic (tg) mice expressing CCL2 under the control of the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (huGFAP-CCL2hi tg+ mice) manifested encephalopathy with mild perivascular leukocyte infiltration, impaired blood brain barrier function, and increased CD45-immunoreactive microglia, which had morphologic features of activation. huGFAP-CCL2hi tg+ mice lacking CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) were normal, showing that chemokine action via CCR2 was required. Studies of cortical slice preparations using video confocal microscopy showed that microglia in the CNS of huGFAP-CCL2hi tg+ mice were defective in expressing amoeboid morphology. Treatment with mutant CCL2 peptides, a receptor antagonist and an obligate monomer, also suppressed morphological transformation in this assay, indicating a critical role for CCL2 in microglial activation and suggesting that chronic CCL2 exposure desensitized CCR2 on microglia, which in the CNS of huGFAP-CCL2hi tg+ mice, did not up-regulate cell-surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, CD11b, CD11c, or CD40, in contrast to recruited perivascular macrophages that expressed enhanced levels of these markers. These results indicate that huGFAP-CCL2hi tg+ mice provide a useful model to study how chronic CNS expression of CCL2 alters microglial function and CNS physiology."

All ofthe above correlations could be explained by the rate of denaturation and theconformational state of the adsorbed protein. In conclusion, proteinengineering for increased stability can be used as a strategy to decreaseirreversible adsorption on surfaces at a liquid-solid interface. The adsorption of proteins at a liquid-solid surface interface has been ofincreasing interest because of its implications in medicine, biotechnology,and the food industry (1Hlady V. Buijs J. Curr. Opin.Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar,2Nakanishi K. Sakiyama T. Imamura K. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2001; 91: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). There are instances whenprotein adsorption is an unwanted effect, such as the irreversible proteinadsorption that leads to biofouling of implantable biosensors and inbiotechnological processes. There are also examples in which proteinadsorption is a desired feature, as long as this can be done in a controlledmanner, so that the structural and functional integrity of the protein ismaintained. Examples of such areas are the production of combined, adsorbedvaccines (3Matheis W. Zott A. Schwanig M. Vaccine. 2002; 20: 67-73Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and thedevelopment of chromatography material(4McNay J. Fernandez E. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 76: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,5McNay J. O'Connell J. Fernandez E. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 76: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The areas in which protein adsorption has a large impact can roughly bedivided into two parts. The first area is when a specific surface is exposedto a large number of proteins, which includes bioimplantable materials andequipment for crude separation of proteins. In this case, the surface has tobe engineered to avoid or govern the adsorption process(6Wisniewski N. Reichert M. Colloids Surf. B Biointerfaces. 2000; 18: 197-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 7Chapman R.G. Ostuni E. Takayama S. Holmlin R.E. Yan L. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem.Soc. 2000; 122: 8303-8304Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 8Ostuni E. Chapman R.G. Holmlin R.E. Takayama S. Whitesides G.M. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 5605-5620Crossref Scopus (1507) Google Scholar).The second area is when a specific protein comes into contact with a largenumber of surfaces, e.g. in the downstream processing, polishing,storage, and final use of proteins produced for biotechnological or medicalapplications. In this case, it is unlikely that all of the surfaces (glass,plastic, stainless steel, rubber, and so forth) that a specific protein isexposed to during production and use can be made resistant to proteinadsorption, i.e. it could be more feasible to engineer the protein tomake it less prone to adsorb onto surfaces. Although this case has not beengiven as much attention, it is interesting to note that the downstreamprocessing of therapeutic antibodies accounts for an estimated 50–80% ofthe total manufacturing cost(9Roque C. Lowe C. Taipa A. Biotechnol. Prog. 2004; 20: 639-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Reduction of irreversibleprotein adsorption is likely to result in less biofouling and higher yields ofprotein and thus reduce the cost of downstream processing. Furthermore, it hasbeen shown that protein adsorption phenomena can lead to a large loss ofactivity of therapeutically formulated protein solutions(10McLeod A.G. Walker I.R. Zheng S. Hayward C.P.M. Haemophilia. 2000; 6: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,11Tzannis S. Hrushesky W. Wood P. Przybycien T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5460-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), i.e. there isboth an economic and a safety incentive to reduce the adsorption of a specificprotein that needs to be produced to meet biotechnological or medicalneeds. It has been proposed that the stability of a protein is one of thedeterminants of adsorption behavior and can even be one of the driving forcesfor protein adsorption (12Norde W. Adv. Colloid InterfaceSci. 1986; 25: 267-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar).The reason for this is that the conformation of folded proteins is quiterestricted, i.e. the entropy is relatively low. However, if theprotein, upon adsorption, tends to unfold to various degrees, this may lead toa conformational entropy gain, which can act as a driving force for adsorptioneven at hydrophilic surfaces under electrostatic repulsion. In terms of thedegree of adsorption, one can thus make a distinction between hard (stable)and soft (less stable) proteins. Therefore, one possible way to reduce proteinadsorption could be to increase the thermal stability of a protein. In arecent study, this has also been shown to be the case, and sugar excipientswere shown to decrease protein adsorption by stabilization of the proteinnative state in solution (13Wendorf J. Radke C. Blanch H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 87: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Furthermore, conformational stability of proteins is an important determinantof the structure of the adsorbed protein(14Billsten P. Freskgård P-O. Carlsson U. Jonsson B.-H. Elwing H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,15Malmsten M. J. Colloid InterfaceSci. 1998; 207: 186-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and earlier workemploying point-mutated protein stability variants has described how thestability of a protein mainly influences with what rate the adsorbed proteinundergoes conformational changes after adsorption(16Karlsson M.

Thus, upon adsorption, aless stable protein will adopt various conformational states ranging fromnative, through molten globule, to a fully denatured state, with each stepgiving rise to an increased number of interaction points between the proteinand the surface and between the adsorbed proteins themselves(17Moulin A.M. O'Shea S.J. Badley R.A. Doyle P. Welland M.E. Langmuir. 1999; 15: 8776-8779Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Hence, theirreversibility of protein adsorption will become more pronounced the moredenatured the protein becomes when adsorbed to a surface. One possible way toreduce the irreversible adsorption of a specific protein could thus be toincrease the thermodynamic stability of the protein and effectively make theprotein more resistant to denaturation on the surface. In an earlier study(18McGuire J. Wahlgren M. Arnebrant T. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1995; 170: 182-192Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it was concluded thatmore stable variants of the same protein displayed a higher elutability uponelution with a detergent. However, the use of detergents is incompatible withthe storage and use of therapeutical proteins. Instead, in this study, weassess the influence that protein stability, as an intrinsic property of theprotein, has on adsorption and desorption to four surfaces with fundamentallydifferent properties (negatively charged, hydrophilic, hydrophobic, andpositively charged). This will enable us to evaluate (i) whether there is acorrelation between stability and adsorption/desorption behavior and(ii) whether this is independent of the properties of the surface. Wehave made use of three variants of human carbonic anhydrase II that differ inthermodynamic stabilities. Furthermore, the mutation sites for these threestability variants are made on the inside of the protein; other propertiesthat can also influence the adsorption behavior such as size(19Ball V. Bentaleb A. Hemmerle J. Voegel J-C. Schaaf P. Langmuir. 1996; 12: 1614-1621Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar), surface potentials(20Bower C.K. Sananikone S. Bothwell M.K. McGuire J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 64: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,21Ramsden J.J. Roush D.J. Gill D.S. Kurrat R. Willson R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8511-8516Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), hydrophobic patches(22Malmsten M. Burns N. Veide A. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1998; 204: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and secondary structure(23Burkett S.R. Read M.J. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 5059-5065Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) are identical in thethree variants. Thus, any differences in adsorption and desorption behaviororiginate in the stability of the protein variants and the differentfunctionalities of the surfaces only. The different surfaces were made up of self-assembled monolayers. In orderto obtain well-defined surfaces, the monomers used to build up theself-assembled monolayer surfaces had the same “scaffoldstructure,” onto which different functionalities were added. Thisminimizes any effects that might arise from variation in chain length,conformational flexibility(24Carignano M.A. Szleifer I. Colloids Surf. B Biointerfaces. 2000; 18: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), monolayer order(25Petrash S. Cregger T. Zhao B. Pokidysheva E. Foster M.D. Brittain W.J. Sevastianov V. Majkrzak C.F.

We havemonitored the surface adsorption and desorption of the protein variants bysurface plasmon resonance(SPR), 1The abbreviations used are: SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RSA, randomsequential adsorption; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RSA, randomsequential adsorption; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. an opticalmethod that can be used to register the protein mass adsorbed.

Langmuir. 2002; 18: 7923-7929Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar)-terminated thiolshas been described previously. The methyl- and amino-terminated thiols wereprepared according to the method for the alcohol-terminated thiol(26Ekeroth J. Borgh A. Konradsson P. Liedberg B. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2002; 254: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), substituting theaminoethanol for ethylamine hydrochloride and N-Boc-diaminoethane,respectively. The Boc protection group on the amine was removed usingtrifluoroacetic acid prior to thioester cleavage. Gold Substrates—Gold substrates used for infraredreflection-absorption spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and contact angle goniometrywere prepared as follows: silicon wafers (100) were cut into appropriate sizesand washed in TL2, a mixture of water (Milli-Q), 30% hydrogen peroxide(Merck), and concentrated hydrochloric acid (Merck) (6:1:1), at 80 °C for10 min. The substrates were then mounted in a UHV evaporation system (BalzersUMS 500 P) and primed with a 25 Å layer of titanium followed by 2000Å of gold. The pressure was <2 × 10–8 mbarduring evaporation, and the evaporation rate was 2 Å/s for titanium and10 Å/s for gold. Assembly—Prior to assembly, the gold substrates were cleanedin TL1, a mixture of water, 30% hydrogen peroxide, and 25% ammonia (Merck)(5:1:1), at 80 °C for 10 min. The monolayers were prepared from ethanol(Kemetyl, Haninge, Sweden) solutions (thiol concentration, 1 mm) byplacing the cleaned, gold surface in the solution for at least 15 h. Thesubstrates were removed from the solution and gently rinsed in ethanol,followed by a 5-min ultrasonication in ethanol. Prior to use in experiments,the surfaces were dried under a stream of nitrogen. Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy—Infraredreflection-absorption spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS66 Fouriertransform spectrometer equipped with a grazing angle of incidence reflectionaccessory aligned at 85°. A liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector was used.Interferograms were apodized with a three-term Blackmann-Harris functionbefore Fourier transformation. The spectra were recorded by averaging 3000interferograms (10 min) at 2 cm–1 resolution. Ellipsometry—Single-wavelength ellipsometry was performed ona Rudolph AutoEL ellipsometer. Light source was a He-Ne laser with wavelength632.8 nm, at an angle of incidence of 70°. The fresh gold plates weremeasured prior to incubation with thiol to obtain reference values of cleangold. As a model, ambient/organic film/gold, assuming an isotropic transparentorganic layer with n = 1.5, was used. The film thickness wascalculated by the AutoEL ellipsometer software as an average of three spots oneach substrate. Contact Angle Goniometry—Contact angles were measured with aRamé-Hart NRL 100 goniometer with no control of ambient humidity. Ascontact liquids, freshly deionized water from a Milli-Q unit and hexadecane(Merck) were used, respectively. Two separate measurements were performed oneach plate. Protein Variants—For the assessment of the influence ofprotein stability to the adsorption and desorption behavior at surfaces, threestability variants of human carbonic anhydrase II were used. Apseudo-wild-type of HCA II with the mutation C206S (HCA IIpwt) wasused as a template for the S56N (HCA IIpwt with a S56N mutation)and A23C/L203Cox (HCA IIpwt with a A23C and a L203Cmutation in the oxidized state) mutants. HCA IIpwt isindistinguishable from the HCA II wild type with regard to structure,activity, and stability (28Mårtensson L-G. Jonsson B.-H. Andersson M. Kihlgren A. Bergenhem N. Carlsson U.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The production andproperties of the S56N, HCA IIpwt, and A23C/L203Coxvariants have been described elsewhere(16Karlsson M.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3487-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Determination of Protein Melting Temperatures(Tm)—Solutions of 0.85 μm protein in 0.1m MOPS, pH 7.5, were prepared and kept on ice. 1.6 ml aliquots weretransferred from the solution to a thermostatted, 1-cm quartz cuvette. Thetime to reach unfolding equilibrium was established by monitoring the changein fluorescence intensity at 336 nm at each temperature, and for eachtemperature a fresh sample was incubated in order to prevent any problems withaggregation during incubation. After the sample had equilibrated, threefluorescence spectra (310–410 nm) of each sample were recorded.Measurements were performed on a Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorometer (Jobin-YvonInstruments). The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the excitation andemission slits were 3 and 4 nm, respectively. The fraction of unfolded proteinwas calculated from the fluorescence data and plotted as a function oftemperature. The transition curves were obtained from nonlinear least-squaresanalysis (33Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar), using theprogram TableCurve 2D (Jandel Scientific). Adsorption Experiments—All experiments were performed in 10mm sodium borate buffer, pH 8.5, prepared with ultra-pure water(Milli-Q-plus system; Millipore, Bedford, MA). All the buffers wereultrasonically degassed under vacuum before use. In all experiments, theprotein concentration was 50 μg/ml. SPR surfaces were cleaned prior tosurface modifications in a UV/ozone chamber for 10–20 min. This wasfollowed by immersion of the surfaces in a 1:1:6 mixture ofH2O2 (30%) (J. T. Baker), NH3 (25%) (Merck),and Milli-Q water (Millipore) for 10 min at 65 °C. The surfaces weretransferred to a beaker of 95% ethanol and cleaned from residual contaminantsby ultrasonication for 1 min. The surfaces were then rinsed with ethanolbefore transfer to the respective thiol solutions. The surfaces were immersedin the respective thiol solutions overnight. SPR measurements were performedon a Biacore 2000 system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) providing a laminarflow through the measuring chamber. The flow rate was 25 μl/min, and thetemperature was kept constant at 22 °C. Gold substrates were gold-coveredglass plates supplied by Biacore AB treated as described under“Assembly” before mounting in the Biacore-chip holder. The proteinwas introduced to the surface by passing a solution of the protein (50μg/ml) in buffer over the surface for 13 min followed by automatic rinsingwith buffer. The total measuring time was at least 43 min for duplicate ortriplicate runs. Data collection was done using the Biacore 2000 software. Forestimation of the surface-coupled mass to the flat surface,ΔmSPR (ng × cm–2), we usedthe relationship ΔmSPR =CSPRΔRU, where ΔRU is the difference in thedimensionless SPR response units, and the constant CSPR is6.5 × 10–2 ng × cm–2(34Höök F. Kasemo B. Nylander T. Fant C. Sott K. Elwing H. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5796-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Treatment of Data for Evaluation of Adsorption Kinetics—Allaverage adsorption isotherms were imported to the program TableCurve 2D(Jandel Scientific) for kinetic evaluation. Three exponential terms wereneeded to make a good fit to the adsorption isotherms with, in some cases, anadditional linear term. Theoretically Adsorbed Mass—The experimentally determinedmasses adsorbed were compared with theoretical values in an attempt to gainadditional information concerning the arrangement of the adsorbed protein. Thevalues from the SPR measurements were compared with theoretical valuescalculated according to (i) a model assuming a close packed monolayer and (ii)a model based on random sequential adsorption (RSA). In calculating the theoretical, close-packed monolayer for side-on andend-on adsorption, the area occupied by each protein molecule is assumed tocorrespond to the circular footprint formed by rotating the long axis (55Å for side-on and 42 Å for end-on) of the respective orientation.The RSA model assumes that the proteins approach the surface sequentially, areadsorbed irreversibly, and do not diffuse laterally on the surface. Thetheoretical surface mass of such a model is about 54.7% of a close-packedmonolayer of spheres (35Välimaa L. Petterson K. Rosenberg J. Karp M. Lövgren T. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 331: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Furthermore, the same calculations have been employed to calculate thetheoretical monolayer coverage for the HCA II protein in its molten globulestate by expanding each radius by 10%(36Uversky V.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13288-13298Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Protein Variants—HCA II is a monomeric enzyme, with amolecular mass of 29.3 kDa, consisting of 259 amino acids. The protein isroughly ellipsoidal, with the dimensions 55 × 42 × 39 Å, andis largely composed of β-sheets. The protein has a pI of 7.3(37Jonsson M. Pettersson E. ActaChem. Scand. 1968; 22: 712-713Crossref Google Scholar) and is expected to have aweak negative net charge at the pH chosen for the adsorption experiments (pH8.5). The main features of the three protein variants used are summarized inTable I, where it can be notedthat all the mutations are situated inside the protein at locations that haveeither no or very low fractional surface accessibility, i.e. thesurface properties of all the variants should be identical. This ensures thatwe have basically identical proteins that differ only in stability. The S56Nvariant has a lower thermodynamic stability, as compared with the HCAIIpwt, whereas the oxidized variant of A23C/L203C(A23C/L203Cox) has a higher thermodynamic stability. HCA II and allthe variants that we have previously produced denature with a molten globuleintermediate that is stable at equilibrium. Such intermediates arecharacterized by a loss of tertiary structure, an increase in diameter(∼10%) (36Uversky V.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13288-13298Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), and exposureof hydrophobic patches (38Ptitsyn O.B. Bychkova V.E. Uversky V.N. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.Sci. 1995; 348: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the stabilized variant A23C/L203Cox has such anincreased stability that its first transition from the native to the moltenglobule state almost coincides with the second transition (the molten globuleto the denatured state), giving an apparent two-state transition(Fig. 1). This results in amarkedly reduced tendency to form a molten globule state forA23C/L203Cox. ANS binding studies during denaturation ofA23C/L203Cox in Gu-HCl revealed that only about 10% molten globuleaccumulated in solution, as compared with HCA IIpwt(30Mårtensson L-G. Karlsson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15867-15875Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In an earlier study(14Billsten P. Freskgård P-O. Carlsson U. Jonsson B.-H. Elwing H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) we showed that, uponadsorption to silica nanoparticles, HCA IIpwt and destabilizedvariants thereof formed a molten globule-like state. This was later shown tobe the case with other protein/surface systems(39Engel M.F. M van Mierlo C.P.M. Visser A.J.W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10922-10930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the caseof HCA II, it was shown that the more destabilized the protein, the fasterthis transition was from the native to the molten globule state afteradsorption (16Karlsson M. Mårtensson L-G. Jonsson B.-H. Carlsson U. Langmuir. 2000; 16: 8470-8479Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although theA23C/L203Cox variant denatures in accordance with an apparenttwo-state mechanism, all other properties resemble those of HCAIIpwt. Thus, the near-UV CD spectra are almost identical,indicating a very similar tertiary structure, and the enzymatic activity isabout half that of HCA IIpwt(30Mårtensson L-G. Karlsson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15867-15875Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The activity of S56N isvery close to that of HCA IIpwt, and the mutation had no effect onthe tertiary structure, as judged from CD analysis(16Karlsson M. Mårtensson L-G. Jonsson B.-H. Carlsson U.

Open table in a new tab Surfaces—In Fig.2, infrared reflection-absorption spectra are shown for thesurface analogues assembled on gold. In addition to bands shown inFig. 2, several bands werepresent at 2800–3100 cm–1 (C-H, several differentlyfunctionalized hydrocarbons). The amide-I, -II, and -III bands are visible forall surfaces at 1650, 1550, and 1260 cm–1, respectively. Forthe terminal amine, the amide-I band coincides with bands fromC-NH+3. Characteristic sulfate bands are visible at1250, 1080, and 1030 cm–1. The ellipsometrically determinedthickness is in good agreement with results from molecular modeling(Table II). Values from contactangle measurements are also shown in TableII. Values are within the ranges expected for the presentfunctionalities. Measurements from infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopyand ellipsometry showed that monolayers with the correct thickness for a 100%dense layer of the four analogues are formed on gold. The low absorptiondisplayed for the amide-I stretch indicates that the transition dipole isoriented perpendicular to the surface normal, thus having a molecularorientation of the carbon chain that is parallel to the surface normal(40Valiokas R. Svedhem S. Svensson S.C.T. Liedberg B. Langmuir. 1999; 15: 3390-3394Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The difference inintensity of the amide-I stretch for the sulfate functionalized thiol is oflow significance. The difference, however, indicates a slightly largerdeviation from the surface normal orientation than for the correspondingmethyl- and hydroxyl-functionalized molecules. Moreover, values from contactangle goniometry indicate that the derivatized group of the various assembledthiols (Fig. 2) are facedtoward the environment. For convenience, we will refer to the surfaces asnegatively charged (-SO–4), hydrophilic (-OH),hydrophobic (-CH3), or positively charged(-NH+3).Table IISurface thickness and contact anglesSurface functionalityd(Å)aValues are given with a 95% confidence interval.

The first discovered member of this family, IRF-1, has a remarkable functional diversity in the regulation of cellular responses in host defense. IRF-1 targets different sets of genes in various cell types in response to diverse cellular stimuli and evokes appropriate innate and adaptive immune responses (1Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A.

One of the interesting genes differentially affected in MNU-induced lymphoma was RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; CCL5). RANTES is a member of the CC chemokine family of proteins that plays an essential role in inflammation by recruiting T cells, macrophages, and eosinophils to inflammatory sites (10Schall T.J. Bacon K. Toy K.J. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1990; 347: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 11Rot A. Krieger M. Brunner T. Bischoff S.C. Schall T.J. Dahinden C.A. J. Exp.

Med. 1993; 178: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). RANTES expression is also a predictor of survival in Stage I lung adenocarcinoma (13Moran C.J. Arenberg D.A. Huang C.C. Giordano T.J. Thomas D.G. Misek D.E. Chen G. Iannettoni M.D. Orringer M.B. Hanash S. Beer D.G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 3803-3812PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression of RANTES and B7.1 have been shown to elicit strong antitumor and recall responses as well as tumor-specific cytotoxic T cell activity when delivered intratumorally with a herpes simplex virus amplicon vector in a murine model of preestablished EL4 T lymphoma (14Kutubuddin M. Federoff H.J. Challita-Eid P.M. Halterman M. Day B. Atkinson M. Planelles V. Rosenblatt J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 643-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our microarray data strongly indicate that IRF-1 mediates MNU-induction of RANTES expression in vivo (9Liu J. Xiang Z. Ma X. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1184-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which IFNγ and IRF-1 regulate RANTES gene expression in primary macrophages has been rarely explored. A study by Lin et al. (15Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Génin P. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) suggests that IRF-3 directly controls RANTES transcription in response to viral infection of human embryonic kidney 293 and Jurkat T cell lines. An earlier investigation of the transcriptional synergism between IFNγ and TNFα in activating the RANTES gene in fibroblasts reported cooperation between IFNγ-activated STAT1α and TNFα-activated NFκB (16Ohmori Y. Schreiber R.D. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14899-14907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). A subsequent study in NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line showed a synergistic activation of RANTES transcription by TNFα and IFNγ involving direct binding of IRF-1 to a site in the mouse RANTES promoter at –150 to –138 (17Lee A.H. Hong J.H. Seo Y.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, one study showed that IFNγ induced RANTES gene expression by stabilizing RANTES mRNA in alveolar epithelial cells (18Casola A. Henderson A. Liu T. Garofalo R.P. Brasier A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L1280-L1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, we undertook the current study to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of IRF-1 and IFNγ in direct regulation of RANTES gene transcription in mouse macrophages using IRF-1–/– mice.MATERIALS AND METHODSMice—Female IRF-1–/– mice and their control, C57BL/6J mice (6∼8 weeks old), were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All of the mice were housed in cages with filter tops in a laminar flow hood and fed food and acid water ad libitum at Weill Medical College of Cornell University Animal Facilities in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines on the principles of animal care.Cells—The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (RAW cells hereafter) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT; endotoxin < 1 ng/ml). U87 cells stably transfected with human CCR5 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Mouse peritoneal exudate macrophages were obtained by lavage 4 days after the injection of sterile 3% thioglycolate broth (1 ml intraperitoneally). Cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and standard supplements. Macrophages were plated in 24-well tissue culture dishes (1 × 106 cells/well). After a 2-h incubation to allow for the adherence of macrophages, monolayers were washed three times to remove nonadherent cells and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and standard supplements. The next day IFNγ (10 ng/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml) were added at different time points. The U87.CD4.CCR5 cell line (human glioma cell line) was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, from Drs. HongKui Deng and Dan Littman.Plasmids—Murine RANTES promoter that extended from –979 to +8 was amplified by PCR with genomic DNA extracted from wild type C57BL/6 mice (5′-primer, ATCCTCCTGTGCCC ACCA; 3′-primer, TGCAAGGGGTGCTCTGCA). The PCR product was cloned into PCR2.1 cloning vector. After sequence verification the insert in PCR2.1 was cut out with XhoI and Hind III and cloned into pGL2-basic luciferase vector. IRF-1 mutants (M1 to M3) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene, Kingsport, TN). Expression vectors pAct-1 (IRF-1), pAct-2 (IRF-2), and control pAct-C were generously provided by Dr. T. Taniguchi (University of Tokyo, Japan). The expression vectors for NFκB p50, p65, and c-Rel were provided by Dr. K. Murphy (University of Washington, St. Louis, MO) and have been described previously (19Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared with Endo-free Maxi-Prep kits (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA).Reagents—Antibodies for IRFs used in this study were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant mouse RANTES protein and RANTES antibody were obtained from R&D System Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant mouse IFNγ was purchased from Genzyme (Boston, MA). LPS from Escherichia coli 0217:B8 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.RNase Protection Assay—Mouse macrophages were pretreated with IFNγ for 16 h followed by treatment with LPS for an additional 4 h. Ten μg of total RNA for each condition was subject to analysis by multiprobe RNase protection assay using the mCK-5c probe set (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Reverse Transcription-PCR—RT-PCR reactions were carried out under standard conditions. The following primers were used for PCR amplification of the mouse RANTES cDNA: sense primer, 5′-GATGGACATAGAGGACACAACT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-TGGGACGGCAGATCTGAGGG-3′; mouse hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase sense primer, 5′-GTTGGATACAGGCCAGACTTTGTTG-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GAGGGTAGGCTGGCCTATGGCT-3′.Quantitative Real-time PCR—To determine the level of mouse RANTES and mouse IRF-1 mRNA by quantitative real time PCR, we used a modified protocol described by Rajeevan et al. (20Rajeevan M.S. Ranamukhaarachchi D.G. Vernon S.D. Unger E.R. Methods. 2001; 25: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA converted from 1 μg of total RNA was diluted in several concentrations. Diluted cDNA was mixed with a pair of primers (10 μm) derived from mouse RANTES or GAPDH cDNA sequences, and SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystem) in a 15-μl volume. PCR cycling was as follows: 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C for 1 cycle followed by 40 cycles at 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. The PCR primers used were: forward primer, 5′-GATGGACATAGAGGACACAACT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TGGGACGGCAGATCTGAGGG-3′, for mouse RANTES; forward primer, 5′-CAGAGGAAAGAGAGAAAGTCC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CACACGGTGACAGTGCTGG-3′, for mouse IRF-1; and forward primer, 5′-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ACACATTGGGGGTAGGAACA-3′, for mouse GAPDH.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—Supernatants from murine peritoneal macrophage cultures were harvested at 6, 12, and 24 h after IFNγ and LPS stimulation and stored at –70 °C. Mouse RANTES was detected by using the DuoSet ELISA kits (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations were calculated by regression analysis of a standard curve.Chemotaxis Assay—A cell migration assay was performed in a 96-well microchemotaxis double-chamber (NeuroProbe, Gaithersburg, MD) using U87.CD4 cells stably transfected with CCR5, which would migrate toward a RANTES gradient (21Deng H. Liu R. Ellmeier W. Choe S. Unutmaz D. Burkhart M. Di Marzio P. Marmon S. Sutton R.E. Hill C.M. Davis C.B. Peiper S.C. Schall T.J. Littman D.R. Landau N.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar) as follows. 29 μl of supernatant from WT and IRF-1–/– macrophages treated with IFNγ or LPS was plated into the lower chamber. Different amounts of recombinant mouse RANTES (0.25–10 μg/ml), serving as positive controls, were added to the wells in the lower chamber in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. As a negative control, the same volume of complete RPMI 1640 medium was used. After separation by polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters with 5-μm pores (NeuroProbe), the upper chamber was filled with 50 μl of U87-CCR5+ cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml). The chamber was incubated at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2 for 3.5 h. Thereafter, filters with migrated U87-CCR5 cells were removed, fixed, stained by the Hema3 system (Fisher, Middletown, VA), and counted. The total number of migrated cells per filter was densitometrically calculated with an Olympus microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Spot digital camera (Sony, Tokyo, Japan).Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear extracts for Western blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were prepared according to the methods of Schreiber et al. (22Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3908) Google Scholar).Adenoviral Vectors and Their Propagation—The construction and propagation of LacZ- and IRF-1-expressing adenovirus were described elsewhere (19Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Transfection Assay and EMSA—Transient transfections were performed by electroporation as described previously (23Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). EMSA and supershifts were performed as described previously (24Ma X. Neurath M. Gri G. Trinchieri G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP procedure was performed using an assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and as described previously (19Liu J. Cao S. Herman L.M. Ma X. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The input and immunoprecipitated DNA were amplified by PCR using primers encompassing the IRF1-RE in the mouse RANTES promoter (5′-primer: GTATTTGGCCAGAGAGGGAGTCAT; and 3′-primer: TTTATAGGGAGCCAGGGTAGCAGA). The samples were amplified for 30 cycles and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel.Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was performed wherever applicable. S.D. of the mean is shown unless otherwise indicated.RESULTSIRF-1-deficient Mice Have Impaired Expression of RANTES Protein and mRNA Expression in Response to Carcinogen—In the original study in which we first characterized the gene expression changes in mice challenged with the lymphoma-inducing carcinogen MNU, RANTES mRNA expression was noted to be severely impaired in IRF-1–/– mice (9Liu J. Xiang Z. Ma X. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1184-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the analysis was performed with the spleen of the mice 4 months after the MNU treatment when the architecture of the organ in IRF-1–/– mice suffering severe lymphoma had been drastically altered compared with the more resistant wild type control mice, thus raising concerns about the validity of the comparison. To alleviate the concern we reperformed the analysis using control and IRF-1–/– mice 1 week after the MNU treatment when the spleen composition of the mice was still largely intact. As shown in Fig. 1A, RANTES protein level in the serum was detectable in nontreated wild type but not in IRF-1–/– mice. One week following the single injection of MNU, elevated RANTES level was observed in the serum of WT mice but not in IRF-1–/– mice. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of mRNA expression in the spleen of these mice showed a similar phenotype in that IRF-1–/– mice had strongly reduced RANTES transcripts with or without MNU challenge (Fig. 1B). Consistent with RANTES mRNA expression, quantitative RT-PCR also showed that IRF-1 was induced by MNU in WT mice (Fig. 1C). These results confirmed our previous finding at both protein and mRNA levels and suggested that both the basal and the carcinogen-induced RANTES expression is largely dependent on IRF-1 in vivo. Within the spleen, adherent cells (macrophages) appeared to be much more potent producers of RANTES than did nonadherent cells (lymphocytes) directly in response to stimulation on a per cell basis given that lymphocytes by far outnumber macrophages in the spleen, because the adherent cells showed a dose response, whereas lymphocytes did not respond to MNU stimulation (Fig. 1D).IRF-1-deficient Macrophages Have Impaired Expression of RANTES mRNA and Protein Induced by IFNγ but Not by LPS—To determine the role of IRF-1 and IFNγ in the induction of RANTES mRNA expression, we isolated RNA from peritoneal macrophages derived from wild type or IRF-1–/– mice following in vitro stimulation with LPS, or IFNγ, or both. The RNA samples were subjected to RNase protection assay (Fig. 2A) and RT-PCR (Fig. 2B), and the cell culture supernatants were subjected to ELISA for RANTES protein secretion (Fig. 2, D–F). Fig. 2A shows that although the wild type macrophages expressed RANTES mRNA in response to IFNγ stimulation (lane 2, top band), IRF-1–/– macrophages were nonresponsive to IFNγ (lane 6). On the other hand, both types of cells were equally responsive to LPS stimulation (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 7). The combination of IFNγ- and LPS-induced RANTES mRNA expression reflected the deficit in IFNγ response in IRF-1–/– mice (compare lanes 4 and 8 in Fig. 2A). This deficiency was persistent because extended stimulation with IFNγ could not alter the lack of response (Fig. 2B). These data were further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR in that IFNγ-induced RANTES mRNA expression was deficient in IRF-1–/– macrophages (Fig. 2C). The selective impairment of RANTES expression was strongly echoed at the protein level, as RANTES protein secretion by IRF-1–/– macrophages stimulated by IFNγ (Fig. 2D) were severely abrogated but not those stimulated by LPS (Fig. 2E) or by a combination of IFNγ and LPS (Fig. 2F). Note that LPS is a much more potent inducer of RANTES expression in macrophages than is IFNγ (different scales are used in Fig. 2D and Fig. 2, E and F). These results suggest that IRF-1 is an essential transcription factor for RANTES gene expression induced by IFNγ in mouse primary macrophages.Fig. 2Selective impairment of RANTES mRNA and protein synthesis in IRF-1–/– macrophages. A, total RNA was isolated from WT and IRF-1–/– peritoneal macrophages and subjected to RNase protection assay. 10 μg of RNA was used for the expression of the indicated cytokines using mCK-5c (BD Biosciences). Data are representative of one of three separate experiments with similar results. B, kinetic expression of RANTES mRNA in IFNγ-treated macrophages. RNA was extracted from peritoneal macrophages of WT mice treated with IFNγ at different times as indicated and subjected to RT-PCR analysis for mouse RANTES mRNA expression. Mouse hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) mRNA expression from the same samples was measured as a loading control. C, quantitative real-time PCR analysis for RANTES mRNA expression following IFNγ stimulation for indicated times. Data were normalized relative to GAPDH mRNA expression levels of non-IFNγ-treated WT cells in each respective sample. The production of RANTES was measured by ELISA from cell-free supernatants of mouse peritoneal macrophage cultures (1.0 × 106 cells in 1 ml) stimulated with IFNγ (D) and LPS (E) or primed with IFNγ for 16 h followed by LPS stimulation (F) for indicated times in hours. Results shown in D–F represent mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Migration of CCR5+ Cells toward IFNγ-stimulated IRF-1–/– Macrophages Is Impaired—The above results indicate that IRF-1 is critical for RANTES gene expression. We were interested in determining whether the deficiency in RANTES production in IRF-1–/– macrophages would translate into the impairment in RANTES-mediated migration. We performed cell migration experiments using U87.CD4 cells (human glioma cell line) stably transfected with CCR5, which would migrate toward a RANTES gradient, among others macrophage inflammatory protein-1α and -1β (21Deng H. Liu R. Ellmeier W. Choe S. Unutmaz D. Burkhart M. Di Marzio P. Marmon S. Sutton R.E. Hill C.M. Davis C.B. Peiper S.C. Schall T.J. Littman D.R. Landau N.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar), in a double-chambered, ChemoTx system (NeuroProbe). Fig. 3A shows that the CCR5+ U87.CD4 cells responded to recombinant RANTES-mediated chemotactic signal in a dose-dependent manner. This chemotaxis was observed also with IFNγ- or LPS-activated murine macrophages as a source of chemokines in a RANTES-dependent manner because neutralization of RANTES using a monoclonal antibody largely blocked the migration of the CCR5+ cells (Fig. 3B). Moreover, IRF-1–/– macrophages stimulated with IFNγ, but not with LPS, were strongly deficient in inducing CCR5+ chemotaxis (Fig. 3C). These results clearly demonstrate that IRF-1 is a critical regulator of RANTES expression and RANTES-mediated cell migration.Fig. 3Migration of CCR5+ cells is impaired in IFNγ-treated IRF-1–/– macrophages. U87.CD4 cells stably expressing CCR5 were resuspended in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 50 μl (1 × 105 cells) were plated in the upper chambers. A, dose response. Increasing amounts of recombinant mouse RANTES (mRANTES) (0.25 to 10 μg/ml) were aliquoted in a final volume of 29 μl for each condition in the wells of the lower chamber. After a 3.5-h incubation at 37 °C, the migrated U87.CD4-CCR5+ cells in the filter were stained and counted under microscope (5 fields counted/condition). B, 50 μl (1 × 105 cells) of U87.CD4-CCR5+ cells were plated in the wells of the upper chamber. Supernatant of WT mouse peritoneal macrophages treated with IFNγ, LPS, or IFNγ priming plus LPS was preincubated with an anti-RANTES antibody (a-RANTES, 15 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Then 29 μl of supernatant from these macrophages was applied to the individual lower chambers. Migrating cells were counted as described in A. C, 50 μl (1 × 105 cells) of U87.CD4-CCR5+ cells were plated in the wells of the upper chamber. 29 μl of supernatant from WT and IRF-1–/– macrophages stimulated with IFNγ or LPS was added to the wells in the lower chamber. Migrating cells were counted as described in A. Data represent mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)IRF-1 Expression Increases Mouse RANTES Production in Primary Macrophages and Induces RANTES Promoter Activation—To confirm the inductive role of IRF-1 on RANTES gene expression in primary macrophages, we carried out a gene delivery experiment using adenovirus expressing IRF-1. As shown in Fig. 4A, the IRF-1-adenovirus-infected HEK293 cells expressed very high levels of IRF-1 protein both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus 48 or 72 h postinfection, whereas the control virus expressing the LacZ gene did not show such expression of IRF-1 protein. Furthermore, the IRF-1 adenovirus-transduced mouse peritoneal macrophages displayed increased RANTES protein production in a dose-dependent manner in correlation with increased IRF-1 expression (Fig. 4B). Again, these data strongly support the notion that IRF-1 is a critical transcriptional activator for RANTES expression.Fig. 4IRF-1 induces RANTES protein production and promoter activity. A, adenovirus-mediated expression of mouse IRF-l in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transduced with an adenovirus expression vector containing mouse IRF-1 cDNA (IRF-1/Ad) or LacZ cDNA (LacZ/Ad) for 48–72 h. Cytoplasmic (cyto) and nuclear (nu) extracts were isolated and analyzed by Western blot using an anti-IRF-l antibody. 33 μg of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were used in each lane. The positive control was an extract derived from peritoneal macrophages stimulated with IFNγ (4 h). B, WT mouse peritoneal macrophages were transduced with mouse IRF-1 cDNA or LacZ cDNA at different doses of the virus from 10 to 40 plaque-forming units (pfus)/cell for 48 h. RANTES production was measured by ELISA from the supernatants of transduced macrophages (1.0 × 106 cells in 1 ml). Data shown are mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. C, the full-length mouse RANTES promoter-luciferase reporter construct was transiently transfected into RAW264.7 cells by electroporation. The transfected cells were stimulated with IFNγ, LPS, or IFNγ plus LPS for 7 h and the luciferase activity was measured from cell lysates. Results shown are mean ± S.E. from six independent experiments. D and E, the RANTES promoter-luciferase reporter construct was transiently transfected into RAW cells together with increasing amounts of an IRF-1 expression vector (D) or IRF-2 expression vector (E) or its control vector (pAct-C).

https://openalex.org/W2113513414,"5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity is increased during exercise in an intensity- and glycogen-dependent manner. We previously reported that a mutation in the AMPK3 subunit (Prkag3225Q) increases AMPK activity and skeletal muscle glycogen content. Transfection experiments revealed the R225Q mutation is associated with high basal AMPK activity and diminished AMP dependence. Thus, the R225Q mutation can be considered a loss-of-function mutation that abolished allosteric regulation by AMP/ATP, causing increased basal AMPK activity. We used AMPK3 transgenic (Tg-Prkag3225Q) and knockout (Prkag3-/-) mice to determine the relationship between AMPK activity, glycogen content, and ergogenics (ability to perform work) in isolated extensor digitorum longus skeletal muscle after contractions induced by electrical stimulation. Contraction-induced AMPK activity was inversely coupled to glycogen content in wild-type and Tg-Prkag3225Q mice, but not in Prkag3-/- mice, highlighting a partial feedback control of glycogen on contraction-induced AMPK activity in the presence of a functional AMPK3 isoform. Skeletal muscle glycogen content was positively correlated to work performance, regardless of genotype. Thus, chronic activation of AMPK by the Prkag3225Q mutation directly influences skeletal muscle ergogenics by enhancing glycogen content. In conclusion, functional studies of the AMPK3 isoform further support the close connection between glycogen content and exercise performance in skeletal muscle."

We tested the hypothesis that TK plays a protective role in myocardial ischemia by performing ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, with and without ischemic preconditioning (IPC) or ACE inhibitor (ramiprilat) pretreatment, in vivo in littermate wild-type (WT) or TK-deficient (TK-/-) mice. IR induced similar infarcts in WT and TK-/-. IPC reduced infarct size by 65% in WT, and by 40% in TK-/- (P<0.05, TK-/- vs WT). Ramiprilat also reduced infarct size by 29% in WT, but in TK-/- its effect was completely suppressed. Pretreatment of WT with a B2, but not a B1, kinin receptor antagonist reproduced the effects of TK deficiency. However, B2 receptor-deficient mice (B2-/-) unexpectedly responded to IPC or ramiprilat like WT mice. But pretreatment of the B2-/- mice with a B1 antagonist suppressed the cardioprotective effects of IPC and ramiprilat. In B2-/-, B1 receptor gene expression was constitutively high. In WT and TK-/- mice, both B2 and B1 mRNA levels increased several fold during IR, and even more during IPC+IR. Thus TK and the B2 receptor play a critical role in the cardioprotection afforded by two experimental maneuvers of potential clinical relevance, IPC and ACE inhibition, during ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2126068683,"Adipocytes arise from multipotent stem cells of mesodermal origin, which also give rise to the muscle, bone, and cartilage lineages. However, signals and early molecular events that commit multipotent stem cells into the adipocyte lineage are not well established mainly due to lack of an adequate model system. We have identified a novel source of adult stem cells from the external murine ears referred to here as an ear mesenchymal stem cells (EMSC). EMSC have been isolated from several standard and mutant strains of mice. They are self-renewing, clonogenic, and multipotent, since they give rise to osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. The in vitro characterization of EMSC indicates very facile adipogenic differentiation. Morphological, histochemical, and molecular analysis after the induction of differentiation showed that EMSC maintain adipogenic potentials up to fifth passage. A comparison of EMSC to the stromal-vascular (S-V) fraction of fat depots, under identical culture conditions (isobutyl-methylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin), revealed much more robust and consistent adipogenesis in EMSC than in the S-V fraction. In summary, we show that EMSC can provide a novel, easily obtainable, primary culture model for the study of adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2144484489,"Angiogenesis is critical for many physiological and pathological processes. We show here that the lipid sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) induces angiogenesis in vivo and GPR4 is required for the biological effects of SPC on endothelial cells (EC). In human umbilical vein EC, down-regulation of GPR4 specifically inhibits SPC-, but not sphingosine-1-phosphate-, or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced tube formation. Re-introduction of GPR4 fully restores the activity of SPC. In microvascular EC, GPR4 plays a pivotal role in cell survival, growth, migration, and tube formation through both SPC-dependent and -independent pathways. The biological effects resulting from SPC/GPR4 interactions involve the activation of both phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and Akt. Moreover, the effects of SPC on EC require SPC induced trans-phosphorylation and activation of the VEGF receptor 2. These results identify SPC and its receptor, GPR4, as critical regulators of the angiogenic potential of EC."

https://openalex.org/W2115528904,"Expression of α-actin in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is regulated, in part, by an intronic serum response factor (SRF)-binding CArG element. We have identified a conserved nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) binding site that overlaps this CArG box and tested the hypothesis that this site plays a previously unrecognized role in regulating α-actin expression. A reporter construct prepared using a 56-bp region of the mouse α-actin first intron containing SRF, NFAT, and AP-1 sites (SNAP) acted as an enhancer element in the context of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter. Basal reporter activity following expression in SMCs was robust and sensitive to the calcineurin-NFAT pathway inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK506. Mutating either the NFAT or SRF binding site essentially abolished reporter activity, suggesting that both NFAT and SRF binding are required. Basal activity in non-smooth muscle HEK293 cells was SRF-dependent but NFAT-independent and ∼8-fold lower than that in SMCs. Activation of NFAT in HEK293 cells induced an ∼4-fold increase in activity that was dependent on the integrity of both NFAT and SRF binding sites. NFATc3·SRF complex formation, demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation, was facilitated by the presence of SNAP oligonucleotide. Inhibition of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway decreased α-actin expression in cultured SMCs, suggesting that the molecular interaction of NFAT and SRF at SNAP may be physiologically relevant. These data provide the first evidence that NFAT and SRF may interact to cooperatively regulate SMC-specific gene expression and support a role for NFAT in the phenotypic maintenance of smooth muscle. Expression of α-actin in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is regulated, in part, by an intronic serum response factor (SRF)-binding CArG element. We have identified a conserved nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) binding site that overlaps this CArG box and tested the hypothesis that this site plays a previously unrecognized role in regulating α-actin expression. A reporter construct prepared using a 56-bp region of the mouse α-actin first intron containing SRF, NFAT, and AP-1 sites (SNAP) acted as an enhancer element in the context of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter. Basal reporter activity following expression in SMCs was robust and sensitive to the calcineurin-NFAT pathway inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK506. Mutating either the NFAT or SRF binding site essentially abolished reporter activity, suggesting that both NFAT and SRF binding are required. Basal activity in non-smooth muscle HEK293 cells was SRF-dependent but NFAT-independent and ∼8-fold lower than that in SMCs. Activation of NFAT in HEK293 cells induced an ∼4-fold increase in activity that was dependent on the integrity of both NFAT and SRF binding sites. NFATc3·SRF complex formation, demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation, was facilitated by the presence of SNAP oligonucleotide. Inhibition of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway decreased α-actin expression in cultured SMCs, suggesting that the molecular interaction of NFAT and SRF at SNAP may be physiologically relevant. These data provide the first evidence that NFAT and SRF may interact to cooperatively regulate SMC-specific gene expression and support a role for NFAT in the phenotypic maintenance of smooth muscle.

Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). This phenotypic flexibility is consistent with the physiological demands placed on vascular tissue and may underlie changes in smooth muscle structure and function that accompany pathological processes, such as those that occur in hypertension and atherosclerosis (2Gorski D.H.

Serum response factor (SRF), a member of the MADS (MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens, SRF) family of transcription factors (5Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), is central to the regulation of a large subset of SMC-specific genes (1Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 6Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 7Owens G.K. Acta. Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Almost without exception, important regulatory regions of these SMC-specific genes contain CArG boxes (CC[A/T]6GG) that are indispensable for expression in smooth muscle (6Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). One motif that is common to many of these genes is a pair of CArG boxes, designated A and B, in the proximal upstream promoter region of the gene. The integrity of each of these elements, as well as conservation of their spacing and orientation, is required for efficient SMC expression (6Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition to proximal CArG boxes, important CArG box-containing regulatory elements have been identified in intronic regions of SMC-specific genes, most notably within the first intron of genes for smooth muscle (SM) myosin heavy chain (MHC) and SM α-actin (6Kumar M.S.

Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SRF transcriptional activity may be modulated by additional cofactors, some of which form complexes with SRF-CArG DNA, whereas others act to enhance SRF binding to CArG boxes without forming a detectable ternary complex (6Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 14Cahill M.A. Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Curr.

Although SRF activity is critically important in the regulation of SMC differentiation and SMC marker gene expression, CArG boxes alone are not sufficient to direct SMC-specific gene expression; additional cis-elements and trans-acting factors are required (reviewed in Ref. 6Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Mechanisms that exist in parallel with the SRF-CArG pathway, as well as SRF-intersecting mechanisms, contribute to SMC phenotypic modulation and maintenance. One of the more recent entries in the smooth muscle phenotypic maintenance derby is the calcium (Ca2+)-dependent transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which regulates the expression of genes in a diverse array of immune and non-immune cells and is closely linked to developmental processes that involve modulation of cellular phenotypes (16Rao A.

NFAT also contributes to pathological processes, as exemplified by its role in the etiology of pathological, but not exercise-induced, cardiac hypertrophy (25Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L.

NFAT activation is regulated primarily through control of its subcellular localization (16Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar, 28Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R.

In response to Ca2+-elevating stimuli, NFAT is dephosphorylated at multiple N-terminal phosphoserines by the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, which promotes NFAT nuclear translocation and DNA binding competence (30Neal J.W. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3666-3673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 31Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). NFAT binds DNA with very low affinity in the absence of a cofactor, and in general, formation of an NFAT·cofactor complex is required for significant NFAT-mediated transcriptional activity. The NFAT family consists of four members (NFAT1/c2, NFAT2/c1, NFAT3/c4, and NFAT4/c3) that share the property of Ca2+-dependent nuclear translocation and a fifth member, NFAT5, which is Ca2+-independent and shares limited homology with the other family members. NFAT activity has been shown to contribute to the maintenance of the differentiated smooth muscle phenotype through regulation of α1 integrin and caldesmon expression (32Ohkawa Y. Hayashi K. Sobue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in regulating the expression of the SM MHC gene (33Wada H. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kakita T. Yanazume T. Abe M. Sasayama S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). More recently, NFAT has been proposed to regulate the expression of the KV2.1 voltage-dependent potassium channel in SMCs and thereby regulate arterial smooth muscle excitability (34Amberg G.C. Rossow C.F. Navedo M.F. Santana L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47326-47334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A number of transcription factors that play a role in regulating SMC-specific gene expression are known to act as NFAT cofactors, including Egr-1, AP-1, YY1, the MADS family member MEF2, and members of the GATA family (Ref. 6Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and the references therein). Using intact cerebral artery preparations, we have recently found that the NFATc3 isoform exhibits nitric oxide/protein kinase G-dependent nuclear localization in vascular smooth muscle cells in response to a normotensive pressure stimulus (35Gonzalez Bosc L.V. Wilkerson M.K. Bradley K.N. Eckman D.M. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10702-10709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The implication is that NFATc3 is constitutively nuclear and potentially active under normal physiological pressure and may thereby provide a link to the postulated role for protein kinase G in the phenotypic maintenance of differentiated smooth muscle (36Lincoln T.M. Dey N. Sellak H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Mack and Owens (10Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that in the context of a construct containing 5′ CArG boxes A and B, exon 1, and intron 1, a double mutation in the α-actin intronic CArG box that disrupts SRF binding also disrupts normal SMC-specific expression, decreasing reporter activity in vitro and in vivo.By sequence analysis, we have identified a highly conserved NFAT binding site that overlaps this intronic SRF binding site. Intriguingly, the CArG box mutations that had been shown to disrupt SMC-specific expression also resulted in disruption of the overlapping NFAT site. The individual contributions of SRF and NFAT to enhancer activity have not been experimentally tested. Here we show that a 56-bp α-actin intronic element that contains conserved SRF, NFAT and AP-1 binding sites is capable of acting as an enhancer element, increasing the basal activity of a minimal promoter-reporter construct in both SMCs and HEK293 cells and conferring responsiveness to NFAT-activating stimuli in HEK293 cells. Mutations that independently disrupt either the NFAT site or the SRF binding site are each capable of essentially eliminating basal activity in SMCs and inducible activity in HEK293 cells, suggesting that both SRF and NFAT are required for enhancer activity under these conditions. In support of the idea that SRF and NFAT cooperate to mediate enhancer activity, we found that both SRF and NFAT bind simultaneously to the overlapping CArG box/NFAT site in this conserved intronic regulatory element under conditions that are associated with enhancer activity. Finally, in vitro expression of α-actin in SMCs was decreased by inhibiting NFAT activation, suggesting that the molecular interaction of NFAT and SRF at the intronic enhancer element may be physiologically relevant. Cell Culture—The rat A7r5 aortic smooth muscle cell line and an HEK293 human embryonic kidney-derived cell line (BD Biosciences) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin (10 units/ml; Invitrogen). G418 (2 mg/ml) was included in cultures of this reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA)-expressing HEK293 derivative (used in experiments involving co-transfection of a Tet operator-EGFP-NFATc3 construct) to maintain stable rtTA expression. The cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Construction of Plasmids—A 56-bp region of the α-actin first intron (corresponding to nucleotides 1035–1090 in GenBank™ accession number U63129) containing a previously identified SRF-binding CArG box, an overlapping NFAT binding motif, and an AP-1 binding site, designated SNAP (SRF/NFAT/AP-1), was used as a starting point in the design of reporter constructs (see Fig. 1). A double-stranded oligonucleotide covering this region was prepared by combining equimolar amounts of single-stranded sense and antisense oligonucleotides (IDX Technologies), heat denaturing (95 °C, 5 min), and allowing them to slowly anneal at room temperature. SNAP oligonucleotides, synthesized to contain NheI sites at each end (61 bp, total length), were cloned into an NheI site present in the multi-cloning region of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (pTAL; BD Biosciences). After transforming competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) and preparing DNA minipreps from isolated colonies (Qiagen), individual clones were screened by restriction analysis to determine the number of inserted copies and then sequenced to determine the orientation of each insert. Reporter constructs containing mutations in the NFAT (AGGTTT), SRF (AATAATTAGG), or AP-1 (TCATACA) binding sites were similarly prepared. Full-length NFATc3 was prepared from a plasmid (pSH205A) containing an alternatively spliced murine NFATc3 cDNA (37Ho S.N. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Li X. Francke U. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19898-19907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. Gerald Crabtree. The N terminus of native NFATc3 was amplified from mouse smooth muscle total RNA by reverse transcription-PCR and ligated into an XbaI site defining the 5′ end of the NFATc3 cDNA. A Tet-operated EGFP-NFATc3 fusion protein expression plasmid (pTetOP-EGFP-NFATc3-HGHpA) was prepared by cloning full-length NFATc3 into a pTetOP-EGFP-HGHpA plasmid constructed from pTetOP-HGHpA (containing a Tet operator and human growth hormone poly(A) tail) (38Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn III, C. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HEK293 cells were transfected with TK-luciferase reporter constructs containing one, two, or three tandem copies of the SNAP element in the all-forward or all-reverse orientation using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (3:1 ratio of transfection reagent (μl)/total plasmid DNA (μg)) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined using the Luciferase Assay System according the manufacturer's protocol (Promega) and expressed relative to empty pTAL vector controls. Luciferase activity was normalized to protein concentration. A7r5 cells were co-transfected with wild-type or mutant SNAP reporter constructs or pTAL empty vector and pRL-TK (Renilla expression plasmid; Promega) using Superfect transfection reagent (10 μl reagent/2 μg total DNA/well) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Luciferase and Renilla activity were simultaneously detected (Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System; Promega); Renilla activity was used to normalize luciferase activity. In some experiments, exogenously expressed EGFP-NFATc3 was used to monitor NFAT subcellular localization and transfection efficiency. For experiments employing HEK293 cells, an HEK293 derivative stably expressing rtTA was co-transfected with TetOP-EGFP-NFATc3 and cultured in the presence of doxocyclin (2 μg/ml) to induce EGFP-NFATc3 expression. A7r5 cells were also co-transfected with an rtTA expression plasmid, but were otherwise treated the same as HEK293 cells. Whole-cell Extracts—After trypsinization, cells were washed three times in PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 9 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin), and incubated for 30 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were assayed for protein content using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. Aliquots were stored at –80 °C prior to use. Whole-cell extracts, containing a mixture of phosphorylated (primarily cytoplasmic) and dephosphorylated (primarily nuclear) NFAT, are a convenient source of material for DNA binding assays (below) because only the calcineurin-activated, dephosphorylated form exhibits significant DNA binding competence. Avidin Biotin Conjugated DNA Binding (ABCD) Assay—Binding of SRF and/or NFAT to the SNAP element was determined using cellular extracts and biotin-conjugated nucleotide probes/streptavidin-coated agarose beads in a modification of the DNA-protein binding assay developed previously by Wu and co-workers (39Deng W.-G. Zhu Y. Montero A. Wu K.K. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 40Zhu Y. Saunders M.A. Yeh H. Deng W.-G. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6923-6928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For each binding assay, whole-cell extracts containing 500 μg of protein were incubated with 400 ng of biotinylated oligonucleotide probes in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 9 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 mm sodium molybdate) for 30 min on ice. Streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (Pierce) were added (25 μl of a 50% slurry), and the suspensions were placed on a gyrating shaker platform at 4 °C for 1–3 h. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 9000 × g (4 °C), washed three times in binding buffer, and eluted in 2× SDS loading buffer for SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation—Whole-cell lysates from HEK293 cells (500 μg total protein content/sample, treated as described in the text) were incubated with 500 ng of mouse anti-NFATc3-agarose conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in DNA-protein binding buffer for 24 h at 4 °C with constant rocking in the presence or absence of unlabeled SNAP oligonucleotide. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation (2000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min), and the pellet was washed three times in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After the third wash, the pellet was resuspended in SDS-loading buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed for SRF or NFATc3 by Western blotting. The absence of nonspecific binding to NFATc3-agarose beads was confirmed by stripping and reprobing for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (primary antibody from Chemicon International; 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature; data not shown). Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) in standard Laemmli buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). After blocking for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20, blots were exposed to primary antibodies (diluted in blocking solution) overnight at 4 °C or for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal NFATc3 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit polyclonal SRF (1:4000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After multiple washes in Tris-buffered saline, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (1:10,000) or Pierce (1:2000) in blocking solution) was applied for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized using standard or high sensitivity chemiluminescence detection systems (Pierce Supersignal West Dura or Femto, respectively). Immunofluorescence—HEK293 and A7r5 cells were grown in an 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slide (Nalge Nunc). Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton in PBS for 10 min, and then blocked in 3% donkey serum in PBS for 1 h. Primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-NFATc3, 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was prepared in 0.1% gelatin in PBS and applied overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody (anti-rabbit Cy5, 1:500; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) was prepared in 0.1% gelatin in PBS and applied for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using SYTOX green (1:5000 in PBS). Cells were examined at ×40 magnification using a Bio-Rad 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope. NFAT and nuclear staining were detected by sequentially monitoring the Cy5 and SYTOX fluorescence using excitation wavelengths of 650 and 488 nm and emission wavelengths of 670 and 520 nm, respectively. Specificity of immune staining was confirmed by the absence of fluorescence in cells incubated with secondary antibody alone. For scoring of NFAT-positive nuclei, multiple fields for each replicate of each experimental condition were imaged and counted by two independent observers under double-blind conditions with the aid of Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp). The software was programmed so that individual pixels within a given image would appear white if co-localization of the green nucleic acid stain and the Cy5-NFAT stain occurred. Thus, for quantification purposes, a cell was considered positive if co-localization (white) was distributed throughout the nucleus, whereas a cell was considered negative if no co-localization (green only) or only isolated co-localization was observed. In-cell Western Analysis—SM α-actin expression in SMCs was quantified using an infrared-based in-cell Western assay system as described by the manufacturer (Li-Cor Biosciences). Briefly, confluent cultures of A7r5 cells were trypsinized and seeded into 96-well plates (70% confluence). After 48 h in 1% fetal bovine serum, cells were treated as described in the text, washed once with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and blocked (Aqua Block with 0.1% Tween 20). Primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-SM α-actin (1:250; Biogenex) or mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (1:200; Sigma)) was applied overnight at 4 °C, followed by secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IRDye 800 (1:800 dilution in Aqua Block with 0.1% Tween 20; Rockland)) for 1 h. TOTO-3 (1:1000; Molecular Probes) was used to counterstain DNA. Infrared fluorescence was monitored using an Odyssey Imager (700 nm for TOTO-3 and 800 nm for IRDye 800). The intensity of both channels was set at 7.5, with a focus setting of 3 mm. Integrated intensity of SM α-actin or β-actin (housekeeping protein) stain was normalized to the integrated intensity of DNA stain. Because of the ease and accuracy with which multiple individual replicates can be independently analyzed, this approach is especially useful where quantitation is the goal. A CArG Box-containing Region of the Mouse α-Actin First Intron Acts as an NFAT- and SRF-dependent Enhancer Element—We have identified a putative NFAT binding site in the α-actin first intron that overlaps a functionally important SRF-binding CArG box (10Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The sequence of this SRF-NFAT binding site-containing region is remarkably conserved among rodent, human, and chicken α-actin and includes a completely conserved AP-1 site at a position ∼24 bp downstream of the NFAT site (Fig. 1). To test these putative binding sites for potential enhancer activity, an oligonucleotide encompassing this mouse α-actin first intronic region containing SRF, NFAT, and AP-1 binding sites (SNAP) was cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid upstream of a minimal TK promoter. Constructs containing one, two, or three tandem copies of SNAP in either forward or reverse orientation were tested in HEK293 cells and SMCs for luciferase expression. The minimal TK promoter-luciferase construct containing three tandem copies of the insert in the reverse orientation showed the highest reporter activity of those constructs tested (data not shown) and was used in subsequent experiments. The wild-type reporter construct (SNAP-Luc) and variants containing mutated SRF (SmutNAP-Luc), NFAT (SNmutAP-Luc), or AP-1 (SNAPmut-Luc) binding sites are depicted schematically in Fig. 2A. Fig. 2, B and C, shows luciferase activity, normalized to the minimal TK promoter-containing (empty) pTAL vector, in SNAP-Luc-transfected SMCs and HEK293 cells, respectively. In both cell lines, the SNAP element promoted a significant increase in reporter activity under basal (unstimulated) conditions, demonstrating that this small region of the mouse α-actin first intron is capable of acting as a functional enhancer element.

https://openalex.org/W1967291996,"Vertebrate oocytes are arrested in G2 phase of the cell cycle at the prophase border of meiosis I. Progesterone treatment of Xenopus oocytes releases the G2 block and promotes entry into the M phases of meiosis I and II. Substantial evidence indicates that the release of the G2 arrest requires a decrease in cAMP and reduced activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKAc). It has been reported and we confirm here that microinjection of either wild type or kinase-dead K72R PKAc inhibits progesterone-dependent release of the G2 arrest with equal potency and that inhibition can be reversed by a second injection of the heat-stable inhibitor of PKAc, PKI. However, a mutant enzyme predicted to be completely kinase-dead from the crystal structure of PKAc, K72H PKAc, was much less inhibitory when carrying additional mutations that block interaction with either type I or type II regulatory subunit. Moreover, inhibition by K72H PKAc was reversed by PKI at a 30-fold lower concentration and with more rapid kinetics compared with wild type PKAc. K72R PKAc was found to have low but detectable activity after incubation in an oocyte extract. These results indicate that inhibition of the progesterone-dependent G2/M transition in oocytes after microinjection of dead PKAc reflects either low residual activity or binding to regulatory subunits with a resulting net increase in the level of endogenous wild type PKAc. Consistent with this hypothesis, the induction of mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts by the addition of cyclin B was blocked by wild type PKAc but not by K72H PKAc. The identification of substrates for PKAc that maintain cell cycle arrest in G2 remains an important goal for future work.

The identification of substrates for PKAc that maintain cell cycle arrest in G2 remains an important goal for future work. The oocytes of most species undergo a prolonged arrest in the cell cycle during oocyte growth. In the case of humans, an infant female is born with her lifetime complement of oocytes already arrested in G2 phase of the first meiotic division. These oocytes can remain quiescent in this arrested state for up to 40 years before initiating the process of oocyte maturation and conversion into an unfertilized egg. It has been evident for many years that this prolonged G2 arrest of the oocyte is maintained by a high level of activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The dependence of G2 maintenance on the second messenger cAMP was first discovered in amphibian oocytes, which decrease cAMP in response to progesterone to release the G2 arrest and re-initiate the meiotic cell cycle (1Speaker M.G. Butcher F.R. Nature. 1977; 776: 848-850Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2Maller J.L. Butcher F.R. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 579-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enormous size of these oocytes and the resulting ability to microinject them facilitated early experiments that showed that injection of the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKAc) 1The abbreviations used are: PKAc, catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PKI, heat stable inhibition protein of PKAc; WT, wild type; NEM, N-ethyl-maleimide; GVBD, germinal vesicle (nuclear) envelope breakdown; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: PKAc, catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PKI, heat stable inhibition protein of PKAc; WT, wild type; NEM, N-ethyl-maleimide; GVBD, germinal vesicle (nuclear) envelope breakdown; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase. blocked the ability of progesterone to initiate oocyte maturation and that microinjection of either the regulatory (R) subunit of PKA (of which there are two termed RI and RII) or the heat-stable inhibitor of PKA, PKI, led to re-initiation of oocyte maturation in the absence of progesterone (3Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Huchon D. Ozon R. Fischer E.H. Demaille J.G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1981; 22: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The demonstration that a decrease in cAMP and PKAc was both necessary and sufficient for meiosis re-initiation was perhaps the first demonstration that all of the effects of a cAMP change could be explained by changes in the activity of PKA, although other targets of cAMP have since been identified (5Zhong N. Zucker R.S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Laxman S. Rascón A. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3771-3779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It also led to the hypothesis that there must be a substrate of PKA that was an inhibitor of the G2/M transition in the oocyte (3Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The universality of this hypothesis gained support when it was discovered that a cAMP decline shortly after meiosis re-initiation was also evident in the oocytes of both mammalian and invertebrate species (7Meijer J Gottesman W Genieser H.G. Butt E. Jastorff B.,. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Schultz R.M. Montgomery R.R. Belanoff J.R. Dev. Biol. 1983; 97: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The control of cAMP metabolism in the oocytes of various species is regulated differently. In amphibians and fish, progesterone has been proposed to bind to a membrane G protein-coupled progesterone receptor linked to adenylyl cyclase that results in the inhibition of enzyme activity and lower cAMP levels (9Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Zhu Y. Bond J. Thomas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2003; 100: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). However, the nuclear progesterone receptor is also present and has been proposed to mediate maturational events (12Tian J. Kim S. Hellig E. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14358-14363Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12607-12612Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In mammalian oocytes, the cAMP level is thought to be maintained in resting G2 oocytes either by transfer of cAMP from the surrounding follicle cells into the oocyte (14Eppig J.J. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) or by the activity of a constitutive Gs-linked G-protein coupled receptor that is likely to regulate adenylyl cyclase (15Mehlmann L.M. Saeki Y. Tanaka S. Brennan T.J. Evsikov A.V. Pendola F.L. Knowles B.B. Eppig J.J. Jaffe L.A. Science. 2004; 306: 1947-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The disruption of follicle cell/oocyte connections leads to a decline in cAMP in the oocyte and “spontaneous” maturation. In Xenopus oocytes, PKAc was found to inhibit the G2/M transition, monitored as germinal vesicle (nuclear) envelope breakdown (GVBD), when microinjected before progesterone treatment or even when injected several hours later, shortly before GVBD (3Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1980; 16: 271-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 17Schmitt A. Nebreda A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that PKAc can block GVBD induced by microinjection of either recombinant Mos protein, a MEKK that activates the MAPK pathway, or of Cdc25C, the phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates and activates Cdc2 (17Schmitt A. Nebreda A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Daar I. Yew N. Vande Woude G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both the Mos/MAPK pathway and the Cdc25C activation pathway are critical regulators of GVBD in Xenopus (for review see Ref. 19Nebreda A.R. Ferby I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 666-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recently, the inhibition of Cdc25C-induced maturation has been suggested to result from direct phosphorylation of Cdc25C by PKAc to maintain the binding of 14-3-3 proteins, which is believed to prevent the interaction of the phosphatase with its substrate, inactive cyclin B/Cdc2 phosphorylated on Tyr-15 (20Duckworth B.C. Weaver J.S. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16794-16799Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Whereas phosphorylation of Cdc25C may explain, at least in part, inhibition by PKAc of Cdc25C-induced maturation, other data have suggested that maintenance of G2 arrest and inhibition of maturation by PKAc may also involve a kinase-independent mechanism. Schmitt and Nebreda (17Schmitt A. Nebreda A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) observed that an apparent kinase-dead mutant of PKAc (K72R PKAc) was just as effective as wild type (kinase-active) PKAc in inhibiting initiation of progesterone-induced maturation, although K72R PKAc had little effect compared with wild type in blocking GVBD induced by Cdc25C injection. The level of PKA catalytic subunit in the cell is determined by the rates of association and dissociation of regulatory R subunits with PKAc. Therefore, a complication in the interpretation of these types of microinjection experiments is the ability of injected catalytic subunits to associate with the endogenous regulatory subunits, causing a net increase in the level of free wild type oocyte catalytic subunit. Xenopus oocytes contain both RI and RII regulatory subunits (17Schmitt A. Nebreda A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 2P. A. Eyers and J. L. Maller, unpublished data. 2P. A. Eyers and J. L. Maller, unpublished data. Although the interaction with R subunits of several PKAc mutants including the apparent kinase-dead K72R PKAc has been investigated (17Schmitt A. Nebreda A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it remains possible that changes in R subunit association or residual kinase activity might account for the ability of K72R PKAc to inhibit GVBD. To investigate this possibility further, we have carried out experiments with PKAc mutants whose interaction with either RI or RII is compromised. The results using a kinase-dead PKAc mutant predicted to be inactive on the basis of the crystal structure indicate that inhibition of GVBD is severely impaired if R subunit interaction is prevented. The data are not consistent with the hypothesis that PKAc inhibits GVBD by a kinase-independent mechanism. Generation of Recombinant Proteins—A cDNA encoding the murine PKAc gene (α isoform, a gift from Dr. Susan Taylor, University of California, San Diego, CA) was amplified by PCR and ligated into the bacterial expression vector pET-30 (EK/LIC), which encodes an N-terminal hexa-His tag as part of a 43 amino acid linker upstream of the initiating Met residue of the catalytic subunit. The following PKAc mutants were generated by PCR using Deep Vent DNA polymerase: K72H (kinase-dead); K72R (kinase-dead); R133A (decreased interaction with RII subunit); D328A (decreased interaction with RI subunit); and the double mutants R133A/K72H and D328A/K72H. All of the cDNA constructs were fully sequenced over the entire coding region to confirm mutagenesis and to ensure that no unwanted mutations had been introduced. Recombinant protein was isolated from the bacterial strain BL21(DE3) 20 h after treatment with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 400 μm. The His-tagged PKAc mutants were isolated from the soluble bacterial lysate (post-28,000 × g supernatant) by affinity purification using Talon beads in the presence of 10 mm imidazole and dialyzed into oocyte injection buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 88 mm NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Brij-35). Purified enzyme was stored at –80 °C prior to use and diluted to the appropriate concentration in freshly prepared oocyte injection buffer. To generate recombinant PKI, a cDNA encoding rabbit PKI (a kind gift of Dr. Richard Maurer, Oregon Health Sciences University) was amplified by PCR, inserted into the vector pET-30 (EK/LIC), and purified from bacteria as described above. His-tagged PKI was dialyzed into oocyte injection buffer and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the method of Bradford, and protein purity was assessed visually after SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue on a 12.5% Anderson gel. Recombinant sea urchin Δ90 cyclin B used to activate Cdc2 in interphase extracts was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (21Grieco D. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9896-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Determination of PKAc Enzyme Activity—To determine the specific activity of PKAc and its mutants, 10 ng (5 nm final concentration) of the appropriate recombinant enzyme was assayed in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Brij-35) using the substrate Kemptide (100 μm) and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (100 cpm/pmol) for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by spotting onto p81-phosphocellulose paper and immersion in 75 mm phosphoric acid. After three additional washes in phosphoric acid, radiolabel incorporation was determined by scintillation counting of the dried paper. To assess the effect of PKI, recombinant His-tagged PKI was included at a final concentration of 5 μm with preincubation for 10 min on ice prior to initiating the assay at 30 °C as described above. For experiments in cycling egg extracts, histone H1 kinase assays were carried out as described previously (21Grieco D. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9896-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and quantified using a PhosphorImager and a Storm 820 scanner (Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of Xenopus Oocytes and Meiotic Maturation—Oocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis ovarian fragments by manual dissection. To induce meiotic maturation, oocytes were incubated in the presence of 10 μg/ml progesterone. The appearance of a white spot in the center of the animal pole, indicative of GVBD and re-entry into meiosis from the G2-arrested state, was scored with a dissecting microscope and confirmed by manual dissection after methanol fixation. To assess the effect of the recombinant PKAc proteins on maturation, oocytes were injected with the appropriate recombinant protein (50 nl) for 30 min prior to progesterone addition. Control oocytes were microinjected with BSA (2 mg/ml) or water (50 nl of each) for each experimental series. In the case of double injection experiments (Figs. 3 and 4), the second injection of the appropriate agent diluted in oocyte injection buffer (50 nl) was performed only after control oocytes injected with BSA had re-entered meiosis, as assessed by GVBD. Typically, 50 oocytes were injected per group and all of the experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results. Oocyte lysates were prepared in the presence of okadaic acid (final concentration 3 μm) 60 min after control oocytes exhibited GVBD. For ex vivo comparison of His6 K72R and K72H PKAc, 1.2 μg of each enzyme was bound to protein G-Dyna beads (Dynal Corp., Lake Success, NY) coupled to anti-His antibody (Sigma). The beads were incubated in extracts from 100 G2 oocytes in the presence of 1 mm p-Cl-thio cAMP. After 30 min, beads were re-isolated, washed, and assayed using Kemptide as described above with the exception that the assay was done for 30 min at 30 °C. Control beads were prepared and assayed identically with the exception that no PKAc was coupled to the beads. Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies that recognize both endogenous and recombinant catalytic PKAα subunits or c-Mos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Cdc2 that is phosphorylated on Tyr-15 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). The equivalent of one oocyte was loaded in each gel lane. Interphase egg extracts were prepared from metaphase egg extracts treated with calcium and cycloheximide as described previously (22Murray A.W. Solomon M.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Effect of regulatory subunit interaction on inhibition of GVBD by PKAc. A, inhibition of GVBD requires R subunit interaction. Oocytes were prepared as in the legend to Fig. 1 and injected with 1 pmol of the indicated PKAc mutant or BSA. After 30 min, progesterone (10 μg/ml final concentration) was added to initiate meiotic re-entry. After 8 h, the percentage of oocytes that had undergone GVBD was calculated. The data shown are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. B, dose response of PKAc mutants. The same experiment was performed as in panel A with the exception that oocytes were injected with the indicated amounts of each PKAc protein 30 min prior to progesterone exposure. GVBD was assessed in groups of 50 oocytes for each PKAc protein. Identical results were obtained in two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To carry out these studies, several different mutants of PKAc were cloned, expressed in bacteria as His6-tagged proteins, and purified to near homogeneity on Talon beads (Fig. 1A). In vitro kinase assays confirmed that a kinase-dead variant of PKAc in which the lysine in kinase subdomain II that interacts with the β-phosphates of ATP was mutated to histidine (K72H) had no detectable activity when compared with WT PKAc, whereas a PKAc mutant impaired for interaction with the RII regulatory subunit and PKI (R133A) (23Smith C.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusudan Akamine P. Taylor S.S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 313-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Gibson R.M. Ji-Buechler Y. Taylor S.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or the RI regulatory subunit (D328A) (25Cheng X. Phelps C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4102-4108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), had enzymatic activity equivalent to that of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 1A). Initial experiments examined the dose response curve for inhibition of GVBD by wild type or K72H PKAc. As first reported by Schmitt and Nebreda (17Schmitt A. Nebreda A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) who microinjected mRNA encoding WT and a K72R PKAc mutant, the dose response curve for inhibition was identical for both proteins and complete inhibition was evident when ∼0.5 pmol of catalytic subunit was introduced (Fig. 1B). Based on these data, for subsequent experiments, oocytes were injected with 1 pmol of various PKAc mutant proteins. We also carried out dose response experiments for the induction of GVBD by PKI and observed that 100% GVBD was obtained with 800–1000 fmol of PKI (Fig. 1C). This dose response curve is consistent with evidence that the concentration of PKA in oocytes is ∼1 μm (3Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schmitt A. Nebreda A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments based on the crystal structure of murine PKAc have established that Arg-133 in PKAc is essential for binding to both RII and PKI (24Gibson R.M. Ji-Buechler Y. Taylor S.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the ability of purified WT, K72H, and R133A PKAc to inhibit GVBD and associated biochemical effects after microinjection into oocytes. As shown in Fig. 2, WT PKAc completely inhibited progesterone-induced GVBD as well as the Cdc25-dependent dephosphorylation of Tyr-15 in Cdc2. It also blocked the synthesis of Mos, a MEKK responsible for the up-regulation of the MAPK pathway during maturation (for review see Ref. 26Tunquist B.J. Maller J.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 683-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In contrast, microinjection of PKI led to the synthesis of Mos, dephosphorylation of Tyr 15 in Cdc2, and activation of histone H1 kinase activity of which >90% is due to cyclin B/Cdc2 (data not shown) (27Gabrielli B.G. Roy L.M. Gautier J. Philippe M. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1969-1975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, K72H PKAc inhibited these maturation events in a similar fashion as WT PKAc and inhibition by either type of PKAc was reversed by a subsequent injection of PKI. R133A PKAc, which has activity similar to that of the WT enzyme (Fig. 1), also inhibited GVBD and the associated biochemical changes; however, this was not reversed by a subsequent PKI injection, as predicted from structural and biochemical studies on the interaction of R133A PKAc with PKI and our in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 1) (24Gibson R.M. Ji-Buechler Y. Taylor S.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Further experiments examined the kinetics of PKI-induced GVBD and the dose response curve for PKI-induced reversal of inhibition by WT and K72H PKA. As shown in Fig. 3A, after injection of PKI, GVBD occurred much faster in oocytes previously injected with K72H PKA compared with those injected with wild type PKA, although both PKAc proteins fully blocked GVBD in the presence of progesterone. This is not the result expected if both WT and K72H PKAc use the same non-catalytic mechanism to inhibit GVBD. Similarly, upon comparing the PKI dose response curve for the reversal of inhibition by PKAc, the K72H-injected oocytes were nearly 30 times more sensitive to reversal by PKI than those injected with WT PKAc (Fig. 3B). One explanation for these results is that the K72H PKAc might perturb the re-association of endogenous wild type PKAc with endogenous R subunits, resulting in a net increase in free endogenous WT PKAc activity. Evidence against this possibility is that R133A PKAc is able to inhibit GVBD with an equivalent dose response curve as WT PKAc (Fig. 4B). Although it is clear that R133A does not interact with RII or PKI, it can still interact with RI in vitro (17Schmitt A. Nebreda A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Cheng X. Phelps C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4102-4108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Western blotting experiments show that oocytes contain both RI and RII, although their relative levels are not precisely known (data not shown) (17Schmitt A. Nebreda A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies based on an analysis of the crystal structure of PKAc have shown that Asp-328 is required for the interaction of the catalytic subunit with RI (25Cheng X. Phelps C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4102-4108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To evaluate the possible interaction of injected PKAc with RI, we microinjected D328A PKAc into oocytes prior to progesterone treatment. As shown in Fig. 4, D328A PKAc was able to inhibit GVBD and the dose response curve for the inhibition was identical to that of wild type, kinase-dead K72H, and R133A PKAc. Based on these results, it seems possible that interaction with either RI or RII is not required for the inhibition of GVBD by PKAc. However, all of these experiments assessing the importance of R subunit interaction were carried out using PKAc or PKAc mutants that had similar high kinase activity (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we extended the experiment by microinjecting before progesterone treatment 1 pmol (45 ng) of the double mutants R133A/K72H or D328A/K72H PKAc, which similar to the K72H mutant above exhibit no detectable kinase activity compared with WT PKAc in an in vitro assay (Fig. 1). The results obtained indicate that these mutants are drastically impaired in their ability to inhibit GVBD (Fig. 4A). To investigate these effects further, we studied the dose dependence of the GVBD block by all of the PKAc proteins. As shown in Fig. 4B, ablation of the kinase activity of either the R133A or D328A mutant of PKAc largely abolished their ability to block GVBD, even when present in the oocyte at levels four times higher than the equivalent PKAc mutants with wild type kinase activity. The lack of inhibitory activity by the R133A PKAc mutant is in contrast to the report by Schmitt and Nebreda (17Schmitt A. Nebreda A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that R133A PKAc with a K72R substitution still exhibited full inhibitory activity toward progesterone-induced GVBD. One possible explanation is suggested by the report (28Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8923-8931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that yeast PKAc with a K116A substitution still exhibited 0.3% wild type activity and could support obligate PKA-dependent growth of the yeast cell. In our studies, we have used PKAc with a K72H substitution, which is predicted to be completely kinase-dead on the basis of the crystal structure and numerous biochemical studies (23Smith C.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusudan Akamine P. Taylor S.S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 313-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To address this issue directly, we incubated the K72R and K72H PKAc enzymes on Dyna beads in G2 oocyte extracts in the presence of cAMP to block any effects of R subunit association. After re-isolation and washing, assays were performed with saturating concentrations of Kemptide as substrate. As shown in Fig. 5, the K72R enzyme had significantly more activity than the K72H enzyme, ∼8 times above the background with control beads in the assay. The specific activity of the K72R PKAc enzyme was ∼2.8 nmol/min/mg or 0.16% activity of WT PKAc (Fig. 1). This level of activity would not have been detectable in the assays comparing WT and K72H PKAc (Fig. 1A), because in those assays, the amount of PKAc in the assay is >40-fold lower to ensure that WT PKAc activity is measured in the linear range of the assay. These results suggest that, even in the absence of R subunit interaction, the K72R enzyme possesses sufficient catalytic activity to mediate G2 arrest of the oocyte. The experiments described so far were carried out in living frog oocytes induced to undergo the meiotic cell cycle transitions of maturation. It was important to know whether PKAc activity was also required for control of normal mitotic divisions. Therefore, we sought to extend our study to frog egg extracts executing mitotic cell cycles. Extracts from activated eggs can carry out up to three consecutive cycles of mitosis and DNA synthesis with kinetics similar to that of the intact embryo (21Grieco D. Avvedimento E.V.

Science. 1996; 271: 1718-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that these cycles are driven by oscillatory cycles of synthesis and degradation of cyclin B; however, superimposed on changes of cyclin B/Cdc2 activity are oscillations in the activity of PKA (21Grieco D.

The sophisticated sets of protein-protein interactions that govern theregulation of many essential biological functions are features that have beenhighly refined through an extensive and dynamic evolutionary process. Theclass of molecules consisting of polypeptide hormones and their cognatereceptors is one example of a highly refined co-evolutionary process(1Wallis M. J. Mol.Evol. 1994; 38: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,2Yi S. Bernat B. Pal G. Kossiakoff A. Li W.H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In particular, the growthhormone-prolactin system of hormones and receptors is a specific illustrationof how related molecules have simultaneously evolved both overlapping andindependent specificities, as well as overlapping and independent functions(3Kossiakoff A.A. Adv. ProteinChem. 2004; 68: 147-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Extensive functional analyses of the hormone-receptor binding interfaces ofhuman growth hormone(hGH) 1The abbreviations used are: hGH, human growth hormone; hGHv, high affinityvariant of hGH; hGHR, human growth hormone receptor; ECD, extracellulardomain; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; SPR, surface plasmon resonance;SG, shotgun; wt, wild-type. and humanprolactin, using site-directed alanine-scanning mutagenesis, have indicatedthat molecular specificity and binding affinity of these molecules are drivenby a relatively few key residues(4Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 5Cunningham B.C. Henner D.J. Wells J.A.

Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar).In most cases, the residues essential for binding affinity do not overlap withthose that confer specificity and cross-reactivity(7Cunningham B.C. Jhurani P. Ng P. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 243: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar,8Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). An important physicalcharacteristic of these traits is that the binding determinants are generallyorganized in a spatially clustered region, whereas specificity determinantsare likely to be charged residues that can be spread throughout the bindingsurface (3Kossiakoff A.A. Adv. ProteinChem. 2004; 68: 147-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,9Kossiakoff A.A. Somers W. Ultsch M. Andow K. Muller Y.A. De Vos A.M.

Although the site-directed alanine scanning method has proven to beextremely useful in characterizing large protein-protein interactions like thehGH-human prolactin system, in practice this type of analysis is quite laborintensive and not amenable to high throughput approaches. In this regard, anew high throughput method called “shotgun alanine scanning” hasproven to be very powerful(10Weiss G.A. Watanabe C.K. Zhong A. Goddard A. Sidhu S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2000; 97: 8950-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 11Skelton N.J. Koehler M.F. Zobel K. Wong W.L. Yeh S. Pisabarro M.T. Yin J.P. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 332: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).This phage display mutagenesis method is based on a combinatorial strategywhere at every position to be analyzed, either the wild type (wt)residue or an alanine is introduced into the phage display library. Afterseveral rounds of binding selection, DNA sequencing is used to determine thewt/Ala ratio at each randomized position. It has been demonstratedthat these ratios can be used to calculate the energetics(ΔΔG) of each analyzed side chain to the bindinginteraction at a level comparable to the conventional Ala-scanning method(10Weiss G.A. Watanabe C.K. Zhong A. Goddard A. Sidhu S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2000; 97: 8950-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar,13Pal G. Kossiakoff A.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This technology made it possible for us, using a set of simple phagedisplay selection experiments, to determine the functional binding epitope ofa variant of hGH (hGHv) binding through its high affinity site (Site1) to theextracellular domain (ECD) of the hGH receptor (hGHR)(13Pal G. Kossiakoff A.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This analysis was basedon the compilation of the wt/Ala ratios from 167 unique inputsequences, and ratios were determined for the 35 residues contained in thehGHv Site1 interface (13Pal G. Kossiakoff A.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Because of the inherent degeneracy of the “shotgun” Ala-scanningcodons used in the analysis, in several instances another amino acid typebesides Ala was introduced into the sequence. However, in most cases thisamino acid type was non-isosteric with the wt residue and could begrouped with the Ala substitutions when assessing the functional importance ofthe wt residue without affecting the results(13Pal G. Kossiakoff A.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We had originally assumed that about 5–10 such substitutions might betolerated without extensively reducing binding to hGHR. However, anexamination of the amino acid composition of the sequenced variants from theshotgun analysis led to the surprising finding that many of thebinding-selected variants actually contained ∼50% of Ala (ornon-wt) residues among the 35 residues intimately involved in theSite1 binding interface. To our knowledge, these variants represent as a groupthe largest wholesale introduction of alanine-like substitutions into abinding epitope while still keeping a high affinity interaction. We note that,although our analysis based on 167 sequences produces a good overview of thevariety in number and distribution of possible alanine-like substitutions, wewould expect that a fully comprehensive analysis of the shotgun data couldidentify many more unique variants that bind to the wild-type receptor targetwith reasonably high affinity. Presumably, the high percentage of substitutions among the residues thatare known to play an integral role in the interaction result in a structurallycompromised binding interface. Therefore, we decided to investigate how such ahigh percentage of the functional binding interface could be eliminated, whilestill preserving substantial affinity to hGHR. Are there definitive patternsfor how the mutations are spatially organized? Are they organized in a fewgroups or are they distributed throughout the interface? Are there regions ofthe interface that remain highly conserved with the wt residues? Howare the thermodynamics of binding affected by the extensively perturbedbinding interface? To address these issues and others we describe here a detailed bindinganalysis based on eleven hyper-mutated hGH variants isolated from the shotgunAla-scanning analysis of a high affinity Site1 variant of hGH (hGHv). Theseeleven variants, referred to here as shotgun (SG) variants, contain14–20 substitutions in the binding interface and have binding affinitiesbetween 1 and 100 nm. We find that the substituted residues in the SG variants aredistributed throughout the Site1 interface with the exception of helix-4,which is more highly conserved. Overall, we find that the binding affinitiesof the SG variants do not track with decreased surface burial or lossof H-bonds and do not appear to follow other general trends associated withkinetic and thermodynamic properties for protein-protein interactions. Themeasured binding thermodynamics indicate that correlations betweenΔS and the hydrophobic effect and conformational dynamicsdeviate from some of those reported for other systems(14Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). In fact, the largeΔCp values determined for the variants cannot beeasily rationalized using any of the physical properties generally ascribed toproducing ΔCp values of the magnitudes observed. Additionally, we find that most of the measured konrates of the wt/Ala variants are generally the same as that measuredfor the wt interaction, suggesting that features such aselectrostatic attraction and conformational changes required for binding aresimilar among the variants, even though the binding surfaces of the variantsare highly modified compared with wt-hGH. Furthermore, we show thatthe Site1 mutations produce an allosteric effect on the binding energetics ofthe second receptor at Site2, and that the stability of the active 1hGH·2 hGHR ternary complex is dependent on the affinity of Site2binding, not Site1. Materials—Oligonucleotides were from Qiagen (Alameda, CA).Plasmids harboring recombinant hGHv, wt-hGH, and the truncatedhGHR ECD (amino acid residues 29–238) were from Genentech (SanFrancisco, CA). The dNTP mix was from Amersham Biosciences; XL1-blue and BL21were from Stratagene. T7 polymerase, T4 ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase werefrom New England Biolabs. HEPES, N-hydroxysuccinimide, andN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide werefrom Sigma. 2-(2-Pyridinyldithio)ethaneamine hydrochloride was fromBiacore. Sample Preparation—Mutants were made in the hGHv backgroundusing Kunkel mutagenesis (15Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar)or QuikChange PCR (Stratagene). Desired mutations were confirmed by DNAsequencing. For the kinetic measurements, all proteins were expressed in theperiplasm of Escherichia coli BL21 as described previously(16Fuh G. Mulkerrin M.G. Bass S. McFarland N. Brochier M. Bourell J.H. Light D.R. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3111-3115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BL21-expressing hGHv andthe shotgun variants were grown at 20 °C, whereas BL21-expressing hGHR ECD(29–238) and wt-hGH were grown at 29 °C. Periplasmicexpressed proteins were then obtained by osmotic lysis, precipitated with 45%ammonium sulfate, desalted, and subjected to fast protein liquidchromatography purification on anion exchange resource Q (AmershamBiosciences), followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 HR10/30. The hGHR ECD was purified on an hGH affinity column. Purity of proteinswas assessed by analytical high-performance liquid chromatography, and themolecular weight of the mutants was confirmed by electro-spray massspectrometry. Sample purity was usually >90%. Protein concentrations weredetermined by using molar extension coefficients at 280 nm of 16.2mm–1·cm–1 for hGH and 55mm–1·cm–1 for hGHR ECD.For the shotgun mutants, molar extension coefficients at 280 nm were adjustedas described by Demchenko et al.(17Demchenko A.P. UltravioletSpectroscopy of Proteins. Springer-Verlag, New York1986Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance—Purified proteins were used forsurface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurement on a Pioneer C1 sensor chip usinga Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore, Piscataway, NJ) at 25 °C as describedby Walsh et al. (18Walsh S.T. Jevitts L.M. Sylvester J.E. Kossiakoff A.A. Prot. Sci. 2003; 12: 1960-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).The C1 sensor chip was first washed with 15 μl of 100 mmglycine-NaOH, 0.3% Triton X-100, pH 12.0, solution, then the surface wasactivated at a flow rate of 5 μl/min with 25 μl ofN-hydroxysuccinimide:N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide(75 mg/ml:11.5 mg/ml) and 40 μl of 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethaneaminehydrochloride (18 mg/ml). S237C-hGHR ECD (50–100 ng/ml) was coupled tothe activated surface through its engineered cysteine near the C terminus.Uncoupled functional groups were blocked with 30 μl of 50 mmreduced glutathione in 50 mm sodium acetate, 1 m NaCl,pH 4.5. Sensor chip coupling and kinetic analysis were performed in HBS buffer(10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005%Tween 20, pH 7.4). All SPR experiments were carried out at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Thesurface of the chip was regenerated with 5 μl of 4.5 mMgCl2. The association (kon) and dissociation(koff) rate constants for Site1 binding were determined byusing the 1:1 Langmuir model from the BIAevaluation program (Biacore). ForSite2 binding by the second receptor (hGHR ECD2), the kinetic parameters weredetermined by a Trimolecular surface plasmon resonance (TM-SPR) method(19Bernat B. Pal G. Sun M. Kossiakoff A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 952-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using the decayingsurface model in the CLAMP(20Joss L. Morton T.A. Doyle M.L. Myszka D.G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) program. For eachprotein, reported kinetics data were the average of triplicatemeasurements. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titrationcalorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed using a MicroCal VP-ITC titrationcalorimeter (MicroCal, LLC, Northampton, MA). The calorimeter was routinelycalibrated with 2′-CMP with RNase A titrations. The wt-hGH andits variants used for ITC carried a G120R mutation conferring only Site1binding to the hGHR ECD1 in a 1:1 complex. For titrations of hGH variants withhGHR ECD, either 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, or20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl bufferswere used. At least two buffers with different enthalpies of ionization wereused to assay for the presence of proton linkage. Although the enthalpy ofhGHv binding displayed a slight buffer dependence (n = 0.6),experiments at pH 6.5 removed this linkage, and the corresponding enthalpyremaining the same as pH 7.4, suggesting that the proton binding equilibriumdoes not contribute significantly to the observed enthalpy at pH 7.4. The heatcapacity (ΔCp) was determined by performing ITCexperiments at 15, 25, and 35 °C. Buffers for experiments run attemperatures other than 25 °C were made so that the appropriate pH wasattained at the desired temperature. This was achieved using the known valuesfor ΔH° and ΔCp for bufferionization (21Fukada H. Takahashi K. Proteins. 1998; 33: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). All sampleswere dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 4 liters of buffer and werede-gassed prior to use. A typical experiment included 25–30 injectionsof 10 μl of hGH or variants (20–50 μm) into 1.4 ml ofhGHR ECD (2–5 μm). The heats of dilution and viscousmixing were taken into account by subtracting the average of thepost-saturation heats. In addition, due to dilution across the needle duringequilibration, the initial injection was set to 1 μl and was routinelydiscarded. The single binding site model was used for data fitting in Originversion 7 (MicroCal, LLC) program. The sequence data used in this analysis were taken from the previousshotgun Ala-scanning analysis of the high affinity variant of hGH (hGHv)(13Pal G. Kossiakoff A.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This variant was derivedfrom an affinity maturation process using phage display mutagenesis. hGHvcontains 15 mutations in its Site1 binding interface and binds to the hGHRreceptor with about 400-fold higher affinity than the wild-type hormone(wt-hGH) (22Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J.Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 564-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,23Lowman H.B. Bass S.H. Simpson N. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This analysis wasperformed using special shotgun Ala-scan codons to vary 35 interface residues;the 15 hGHv mutations and 20 additional positions within the hormone-receptorcontact interface (13Pal G. Kossiakoff A.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Theshotgun codons were designed to give either Ala or wt for each of the35 targeted residues in the Site1 interface in the unselected startinglibrary, although the redundancy in the genetic code in some cases producestwo other amino acid substitutions(10Weiss G.A. Watanabe C.K. Zhong A. Goddard A. Sidhu S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2000; 97: 8950-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We note that Pal etal. (13Pal G. Kossiakoff A.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed that inmost cases the additional amino acid types that might be introduced instead ofalanine could be grouped with the Ala substitutions. Thus, the term non-wildtype (non-wt) is used here to include both Ala and other amino acidtypes that occur due to the degeneracy of the shotgun codons. The hGHv phage display libraries were subjected to two independentselection protocols (13Pal G. Kossiakoff A.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Forone of the selections, the hGHR ECD was immobilized on a plate and used as thecapture target. The hGHv phage display variants captured in this step formedthe basis for determining the wt/Ala ratios to calculate the changesin binding free energies (13Pal G. Kossiakoff A.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In the other independent selection, a monoclonal antibody that recognized anepitope on hGHv outside the area of mutation was used to capture a generalpopulation of the displayed library phage. This step quantified the decreases(or increases) in the level of hGHv variants displayed on phage consideringthe overall pool of wt/Ala at each mutated position, either becauseof expression or stability. Correcting for expression bias is an essentialnormalization factor that is applied to the results of the hGHR ECD capture toensure that a certain amino acid type is not over or undercounted at any ofthe sites of mutation due to an expression or stability bias(10Weiss G.A. Watanabe C.K. Zhong A. Goddard A. Sidhu S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2000; 97: 8950-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar,13Pal G. Kossiakoff A.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). From the shotgun (SG) Ala-scanning library selections produced in thebiopanning against the immobilized hGHR ECD, 167 unique clones were isolatedand sequenced (13Pal G. Kossiakoff A.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The term“mutations” is defined as the difference in each of these clonescompared with the parental high affinity hGHv molecule instead of thewt-hGH sequence. To draw clear distinctions when comparing thesequence of an SG clone to either the hGHv or the native hGHsequence, we have adopted the following nomenclature: wtVto represent the amino acid types based on the hGHv sequence andwtN to represent the amino acid types in the native hGHmolecule. It is noteworthy that, although the shotgun Ala-scanning is based onsubstitutions in the hGHv sequence, there are in most cases so manysubstitutions overall that it is probably not justified to assign the hGHvsequence as the parental sequence. Rather the extensive substitution ofnon-homologous residue types in the binding interface of this molecule (and byinference the wt-hGH molecule) indicates that tight binding can beaccomplished in these 4-helix bundle scaffolds even if the native bindingcontacts are significantly compromised. Fig. 1 shows the compositionof wtV/non-wtV ratios in these clonesbased on the hGHv sequence. The distribution of non-wtvsubstitutions is reasonably symmetrical centered around 18non-wtV residue types over 35 positions analyzed by theshotgun Ala-scan of hGHv. In fact, over 70% of the sequenced clones containedbetween 16 and 20 non-wtV residues types. Of thenon-wtV residues, about two-thirds are Ala with theremaining one-third being another amino acid type resulting from thedegeneracy of the codons. If these comparisons are made to the nativewtN sequence, the number of non-wt residuesincreases typically up to 20–25 non-wtNresidues. If the same analysis is applied to the smaller 15-residue subset of sitesthat were mutated in the original phage display libraries that produced hGHv(22Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J.Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 564-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the so-called hot-spotresidues, again about half the groups (∼8) were found on average to benon-wtv residue types. This indicates that even the groupof residues most responsible for Site1 binding can be significantly altered,yet still produce a reasonably tight binding molecule. Eleven SG variants were chosen for detailed study to determine thebinding characteristics of their highly modified binding interfaces. Theselection criteria were such as to ensure a broad sampling of bindingaffinities and spatial distribution of the mutations. These variants contained14–20 non-wtV residues in their Site1 binding site(Fig. 2A). The bindingkinetics of these variants were determined by surface plasmon resonance(Tables I andII). The measured equilibriumdissociation constants (Kd) range from 1.5 nm,which is close to wt-hGH, to ∼100 nm for a SGvariant that contained 20 non-wtV residues in itssequence. The differences in binding affinities were generally characterizedby changes in the koff step(Table I). However, whereas inmost previous studies the kon values of mutatedwt-hGH variants were remarkably similar(24Bernat B. Sun M. Dwyer M. Feldkamp M. Kossiakoff A.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6076-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), several of the weakerbinding SG variants analyzed here displayed association rateconstants that were 5- to 10-fold lower than that observed for thewt-hGH hormone (∼2- to 3-fold lower than hGHv).Table ISite1 binding of SG variants to the hGHR ECD1HormoneskonkoffKdaEquilibrium dissociation constant, Kd =koff/kon.Relative KdΔΔGBuried surface aream-1 s-1 ×105s-1 × 10-4nmmut/wtkcal/molÅ2wt-hGHbValues were taken from Bernat et al.(24).

The calculated changesin ΔΔG for these variants range from 0.3-4.2 kcal/mol.These calculated values track qualitatively with the measured dissociationconstant values. For instance, variants SG1, SG2, SG3, andSG4 are predicted to have relatively small changes inΔΔG compared with SG6, SG8, SG10, andSG11, which is what is observed. We note that the calculated changesin ΔΔG assume that the residues contribute to binding inadditive fashion, and it has been shown that residu"
https://openalex.org/W2141022585,"Maspin, a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family, is a tumor suppressor in breast and prostate cancer. To address molecular mechanisms underlying maspin's activity, we restored its expression in invasive carcinoma cells and analyzed the resulting changes by shotgun proteomics. Using a mass spectrometry-based multidimensional proteomic method, we observed changes to the expression of approximately 27% of the detectable proteome. In particular, we noted changes to the expression of proteins that regulate cytoskeletal architecture, cell death, and protein turnover. In each case, changes in protein expression were accompanied by measurable changes in tumor cell phenotype. Thus, maspin-expressing cells exhibit a more prominent actin cytoskeleton, a reduced invasive capacity, an increased rate of spontaneous apoptosis, and an altered proteasome function. These observations reveal for the first time the far reaching effects of maspin on multiple protein networks and a new hypothesis of maspin function based on the regulation of proteasome function."
