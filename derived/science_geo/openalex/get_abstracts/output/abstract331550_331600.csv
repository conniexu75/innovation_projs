CCD has resulted in a loss of 50 to 90% of colonies in beekeeping operations across the United States. The observation that irradiated combs from affected colonies can be repopulated with naive bees suggests that infection may contribute to CCD. We used an unbiased metagenomic approach to survey microflora in CCD hives, normal hives, and imported royal jelly. Candidate pathogens were screened for significance of association with CCD by the examination of samples collected from several sites over a period of 3 years. One organism, Israeli acute paralysis virus of bees, was strongly correlated with CCD."

The cultural intelligence hypothesis argues that this is mainly due to a species-specific set of social-cognitive skills, emerging early in ontogeny, for participating and exchanging knowledge in cultural groups. We tested this hypothesis by giving a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests to large numbers of two of humans' closest primate relatives, chimpanzees and orangutans, as well as to 2.5-year-old human children before literacy and schooling. Supporting the cultural intelligence hypothesis and contradicting the hypothesis that humans simply have more ""general intelligence,"" we found that the children and chimpanzees had very similar cognitive skills for dealing with the physical world but that the children had more sophisticated cognitive skills than either of the ape species for dealing with the social world."

Vector distances between the place fields were reflected in the temporal structure of these sequences. This bidirectional re-enactment of temporal sequences may contribute to the establishment of higher-order associations in episodic memory."
https://openalex.org/W1991721037,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by impairments in social behaviors that are sometimes coupled to specialized cognitive abilities. A small percentage of ASD patients carry mutations in genes encoding neuroligins, which are postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules. We introduced one of these mutations into mice: the Arg 451 →Cys 451 (R451C) substitution in neuroligin-3. R451C mutant mice showed impaired social interactions but enhanced spatial learning abilities. Unexpectedly, these behavioral changes were accompanied by an increase in inhibitory synaptic transmission with no apparent effect on excitatory synapses. Deletion of neuroligin-3, in contrast, did not cause such changes, indicating that the R451C substitution represents a gain-of-function mutation. These data suggest that increased inhibitory synaptic transmission may contribute to human ASDs and that the R451C knockin mice may be a useful model for studying autism-related behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2004608668,"Epigenetic chromatin marks restrict the ability of differentiated cells to change gene expression programs in response to environmental cues and to transdifferentiate. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins mediate gene silencing and repress transdifferentiation in a manner dependent on histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). However, macrophages migrated into inflamed tissues can transdifferentiate, but it is unknown whether inflammation alters PcG-dependent silencing. Here we show that the JmjC-domain protein Jmjd3 is a H3K27me demethylase expressed in macrophages in response to bacterial products and inflammatory cytokines. Jmjd3 binds PcG target genes and regulates their H3K27me3 levels and transcriptional activity. The discovery of an inducible enzyme that erases a histone mark controlling differentiation and cell identity provides a link between inflammation and reprogramming of the epigenome, which could be the basis for macrophage plasticity and might explain the differentiation abnormalities in chronic inflammation.

Epigenetic mechanisms enforcing accessibility and usage of the genetic material are the foundation of cell differentiation. Epigenetic control is largely operated via covalent modifications of histones and DNA, which are linked to effector mechanisms by proteins bearing recognition domains specific for modified residues (Jenuwein and Allis, 2001Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Translating the histone code.Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7206) Google Scholar, Kouzarides, 2007Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7367) Google Scholar). In both Drosophila and mammals, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) brings about silencing of developmental genes, which is inheritable across cell generations (Lund and van Lohuizen, 2004Lund A.H. van Lohuizen M. Polycomb complexes and silencing mechanisms.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). H3K27me3 is catalyzed by a single SET-domain-containing enzyme, Ezh2, which associates with Suz12, Eed, and RbAp48 to form the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2). H3K27me3 is recognized by the chromodomain of Polycomb (Pc) in Drosophila, or of Polycomb orthologs in mammalian cells, which are themselves part of multimolecular complexes collectively known as PRC1 (Lund and van Lohuizen, 2004Lund A.H. van Lohuizen M. Polycomb complexes and silencing mechanisms.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Genome-wide mapping of H3K27me3 and PcG proteins in mammalian cells has shown co-occupancy of a large set of genes whose products control cell fate and embryonic development, including developmental transcription factors (e.g., the homeotic Hox genes) and cell-surface or extracellular proteins involved in cell fate regulation and patterning (e.g., Wnt proteins and members of the TGF-β superfamily)(Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A.

PcG proteins are broadly expressed. However, their levels can be modulated by environmental inputs, thus linking extracellular cues to reprogramming of the epigenome. For instance, expression of the PRC1 component Bmi1 in the cerebellum is controlled by the morphogen sonic hedgehog (Leung et al., 2004Leung C. Lingbeek M. Shakhova O. Liu J. Tanger E. Saremaslani P. Van Lohuizen M. Marino S. Bmi1 is essential for cerebellar development and is overexpressed in human medulloblastomas.Nature. 2004; 428: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The most striking example of the impact of extrinsic signals on Polycomb function and cell differentiation is provided by imaginal discs in Drosophila. Imaginal discs are larval clusters of cells that generate the external cuticle and appendages like legs and wings. When removed from larvae, fragmented and cultured in vitro, imaginal discs proliferate and regenerate the corresponding body part. However, in a few cases the disc can switch identity and generate an alternative body part, a phenomenon known as transdetermination (Hadorn, 1968Hadorn E. Transdetermination in cells.Sci. Am. 1968; 219: 110-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): the frequency of transdetermination events is greatly enhanced in PcG mutant flies (Lee et al., 2005Lee N. Maurange C. Ringrose L. Paro R. Suppression of Polycomb group proteins by JNK signalling induces transdetermination in Drosophila imaginal discs.Nature. 2005; 438: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), indicating that PcG proteins limit chromatin plasticity and epigenome reprogramming in regenerating tissues. The link between damage, regeneration, and reprogramming of the epigenome is strengthened by additional experimental models. For instance, tail regeneration in axolotls depends on transdifferentiation of neural cells into cartilage and muscle (Echeverri and Tanaka, 2002Echeverri K. Tanaka E.M. Ectoderm to mesoderm lineage switching during axolotl tail regeneration.Science. 2002; 298: 1993-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and replacement of destroyed sensory hair cells of the inner ear in the mouse relies on transdifferentiation of epithelial support cells (White et al., 2006White P.M. Doetzlhofer A. Lee Y.S. Groves A.K. Segil N. Mammalian cochlear supporting cells can divide and trans-differentiate into hair cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 984-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Macrophages and their progenitors also show some degree of plasticity when exposed to inflammatory stimuli. After corneal transplants in the mouse, macrophages infiltrate the inflamed cornea and transdifferentiate into lymphoendothelial cells, thus generating a new system of lymphatic vessels within the avascular cornea (Maruyama et al., 2005Maruyama K. Ii M. Cursiefen C. Jackson D.G. Keino H. Tomita M. Van Rooijen N. Takenaka H. D'Amore P.A. Stein-Streilein J. et al.Inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis in the cornea arises from CD11b-positive macrophages.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2363-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Similarly, de novo lymphoangiogenesis in rejected and inflamed kidney transplants is due to recipient-derived myeloid cells (Kerjaschki et al., 2006Kerjaschki D. Huttary N. Raab I. Regele H. Bojarski-Nagy K. Bartel G. Krober S.M. Greinix H. Rosenmaier A. Karlhofer F. et al.Lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells contribute to de novo lymphangiogenesis in human renal transplants.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Finally, hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors bear receptors for microbial components, whose triggering stimulates survival, promotes macrophage differentiation, and causes lymphoid progenitors to transdifferentiate into dendritic cells (Nagai et al., 2006Nagai Y. Garrett K.P. Ohta S. Bahrun U. Kouro T. Akira S. Takatsu K. Kincade P.W. Toll-like receptors on hematopoietic progenitor cells stimulate innate immune system replenishment.Immunity. 2006; 24: 801-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). We previously reported that histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) is erased from the promoters of some slowly activated inflammatory genes upon activation (Saccani and Natoli, 2002Saccani S. Natoli G. Dynamic changes in histone H3 Lys 9 methylation occurring at tightly regulated inducible inflammatory genes.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and we hypothesized the requirement for a H3K9 demethylase in their activation. However, no enzyme capable of demethylating histones was known at that time. This scenario changed with the identification of an enzyme capable of turning over methylated histone residues by deiminating mono-methylarginine (PADI4) (Cuthbert et al., 2004Cuthbert G.L. Daujat S. Snowden A.W. Erdjument-Bromage H. Hagiwara T. Yamada M. Schneider R. Gregory P.D. Tempst P. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Histone deimination antagonizes arginine methylation.Cell. 2004; 118: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), which was followed by the discovery of the first true histone demethylase (HDM), LSD1 (Shi et al., 2004Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Shi Y. Histone demethylation mediated by the nuclear amine oxidase homolog LSD1.Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar, Metzger et al., 2005Metzger E. Wissmann M. Yin N. Muller J.M. Schneider R. Peters A.H. Gunther T. Buettner R. Schule R. LSD1 demethylates repressive histone marks to promote androgen-receptor-dependent transcription.Nature. 2005; 437: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). More recently, proteins containing the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain were demonstrated to catalyze site-specific demethylation of mono-, di-, and trimethylated histones (Tsukada et al., 2006Tsukada Y. Fang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Warren M.E. Borchers C.H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Histone demethylation by a family of JmjC domain-containing proteins.Nature. 2006; 439: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, Klose et al., 2006Klose R.J. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. JmjC-domain-containing proteins and histone demethylation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The JmjC domain is a variant of the “2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad,” a structural motif in which a nonheme iron center is primed for attack by molecular oxygen upon binding of an α-oxoacid cofactor (usually α-ketoglutarate) (Koehntop et al., 2005Koehntop K.D. Emerson J.P. Que Jr., L. The 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad: a versatile platform for dioxygen activation by mononuclear non-heme iron(II) enzymes.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2005; 10: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). This generates a highly reactive oxidizing intermediate that catalyzes substrate oxidation. JmjC domain proteins demethylate histones through a mechanism involving hydroxylation of the methyl groups and their subsequent release as formaldehyde (Tsukada et al., 2006Tsukada Y. Fang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Warren M.E. Borchers C.H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Histone demethylation by a family of JmjC domain-containing proteins.Nature. 2006; 439: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). About 30 proteins with a JmjC domain are annotated in the mouse and human genomes (Klose et al., 2006Klose R.J. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. JmjC-domain-containing proteins and histone demethylation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), although some of them are unlikely to be involved in histone demethylation due either to their cytoplasmic localization or to aminoacidic substitutions in the iron- and/or cofactor-binding sites. With the initial aim of identifying an inducible H3K9 demethylase involved in inflammatory gene control (Saccani and Natoli, 2002Saccani S. Natoli G. Dynamic changes in histone H3 Lys 9 methylation occurring at tightly regulated inducible inflammatory genes.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we profiled the expression of JmjC domain proteins in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. We found that Jmjd3, an active hydroxylase with no described function, is quickly and strongly induced in macrophages exposed to bacterial products and inflammatory cytokines. Jmjd3 induction depends on direct binding of the transcription factor NF-kB to a cluster of three kB sites in the Jmjd3 gene promoter. Contrary to our initial expectations, Jmjd3 does not demethylate H3K9. Instead, it is an efficient H3K27me3 demethylase that binds PcG target genes and regulates their H3K27me3 levels and transcriptional activity. We first measured the effects of bacterial products and inflammatory cytokines on the expression of JmjC domain proteins in mouse macrophages. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analysis was carried out on cDNAs obtained from Raw264.7 cells stimulated with LPS, a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Innate immune recognition.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (5716) Google Scholar). Among the about 30 JmjC genes annotated in the mouse genome, only 1, Jmjd3, was strongly induced by LPS stimulation (Figures 1A and 1B). The closely related Utx and Uty showed constant and comparatively low levels of expression. Jmjd3 mRNA upregulation occurred rapidly and peaked between 1 and 2 hr after stimulation (Figure 1C). Similar results were obtained in J774.1 macrophage cells and in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (Figure 1D), while Jmjd3 expression was unaffected by inflammatory stimuli in the nonmacrophage cells tested (Figure 1E). Other TLR agonists, namely CpG containing DNA sequences (TLR9) and zymosan particles (TLR2), similarly induced Jmjd3 expression, while the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) was much less effective (Figure 1F). Jmjd3 induction by TLR agonists in primary macrophages required MyD88, an adaptor molecule essential for signal transduction by TLRs (Figure 1G). To analyze Jmjd3 expression at the protein level, we raised a polyclonal antibody that efficiently recognizes the endogenous protein. Consistent with the mRNA data, Jmjd3 was expressed at low basal levels, and it was strongly upregulated after LPS stimulation (Figure 1H). NF-kB is a family of transcription factors required for the induction of the most important classes of inflammatory genes (Hayden et al., 2006Hayden M.S. West A.P. Ghosh S. NF-kappaB and the immune response.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6758-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar).To determine the dependence of Jmjd3 induction on NF-kB, we infected J774.1 macrophages with a recombinant adenovirus expressing a HA-tagged IkBα “super repressor” (IkBα-SR) (Jobin et al., 1998Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. Inhibition of proinflammatory molecule production by adenovirus-mediated expression of a nuclear factor kappaB super-repressor in human intestinal epithelial cells.J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells IkBα binds NF-kB dimers and prevents their nuclear accumulation. Upon activation by inflammatory stimuli, the IkB kinase complex (Ikk) phosphorylates IkBα at two N-terminal serines, thus promoting its polyubiquitination and degradation and the nuclear entry of the freed NF-kB dimers (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Phosphorylation meets ubiquitination: the control of NF-[kappa]B activity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (3909) Google Scholar). Resynthesis of IkBα requires NF-kB binding to the IkBα gene promoter and occurs quickly after NF-kB activation. The IkBα super repressor contains Ser > Ala mutations in the two Ikk phosphorylation sites. Therefore, it does not undergo phosphorylation and degradation and efficiently sequesters most NF-kB species in the cytoplasm, as indicated by the lack of resynthesis of endogenous IkBα 2 hr poststimulation (Figure 2A, upper panel). Jmjd3 induction by LPS was strongly inhibited by IkBα-SR, thus indicating that NF-kB was required for its induction (Figure 2A). To obtain definitive genetic evidence for the requirement of NF-kB in Jmjd3 induction, we prepared macrophages from knockin mice in which the Ikkγ gene (encoding for an essential component of the Ikk complex) is flanked by loxP sites and deleted upon Cre recombinase-mediated excision (Luedde et al., 2007Luedde T. Beraza N. Kotsikoris V. van Loo G. Nenci A. De Vos R. Roskams T. Trautwein C. Pasparakis M. Deletion of NEMO/IKKgamma in liver parenchymal cells causes steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 119-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Macrophages were differentiated and treated with the cell-permeant Tat-Cre fusion protein (Peitz et al., 2002Peitz M. Pfannkuche K. Rajewsky K. Edenhofer F. Ability of the hydrophobic FGF and basic TAT peptides to promote cellular uptake of recombinant Cre recombinase: a tool for efficient genetic engineering of Mamm. Genomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 4489-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) 2 days before LPS stimulation. Induction of the Jmjd3 mRNA was strongly impaired in Tat-Cre-treated cells, thus confirming the requirement for NF-kB in the activation of Jmjd3 (Figure 2B). To determine if NF-kB controls Jmjd3 induction directly, we first aligned the mouse and human Jmjd3 genes to identify stretches of conserved sequences containing NF-kB-binding sites (kB sites)(Natoli et al., 2005Natoli G. Saccani S. Bosisio D. Marazzi I. Interactions of NF-kappaB with chromatin: the art of being at the right place at the right time.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). While we could not identify any kB site in the 3000 bp upstream of the annotated transcription start site (Figure 2C), we found two regions in the annotated first intron (between two noncoding exons) and one region in the 3′ UTR, which contain kB sites with a 100% conservation between the mouse and the human genome. We next used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with an antibody directed against the NF-kB subunit p65/RelA to measure NF-kB recruitment to these three regions. In LPS-stimulated cells, p65/RelA selectively bound to region 2 (Figure 2D), which lies upstream of the second exon in the annotated Refseq transcript. Since kB sites are most often located in promoters and close to transcriptional start sites (TSSs), we analyzed whether the mapped TSS in the Jmjd3 gene is functional in macrophages. To do so we first analyzed the presence and inducibility of transcripts in which annotated exon 1 is spliced to exon 2. While these transcripts were readily detectable in mouse embryonic stem cells (G.T. and G.N., unpublished data), they were close to background levels in macrophages and were not induced by LPS (Figure 2E, left). As a second criterion for promoter activity, we measured H3K4me3 levels, as this mark is selectively localized at active TSSs (The ENCODE Consortium, 2007The ENCODE ConsortiumIdentification and analysis of functional elements in 1% of the human genome by the ENCODE pilot project.Nature. 2007; 447: 799-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (3837) Google Scholar). Only the region preceding the second exon was associated with robust and constitutive H3K4me3 levels in macrophages (Figure 2E, right). Therefore, while the TSS corresponding to the RefSeq transcript is active in ES cells, inducible transcription of Jmjd3 in macrophages relies on a promoter located next to the functional kB sites. Phylogenetic clustering of JmjC-domain-containing proteins indicates that Jmjd3 belongs to the Utx/Uty subfamily (Klose et al., 2006Klose R.J. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. JmjC-domain-containing proteins and histone demethylation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Utx and Uty are broadly expressed proteins characterized by N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and a C-terminal JmjC domain. In Jmjd3 the only clearly identifiable domain is the C-terminal JmjC (Figure 3D). The Utx gene is located on the X chromosome and is one of the few genes that escape X inactivation: it is likely that Uty expression from the Y chromosome in males reflects a mechanism of dosage compensation (Greenfield et al., 1998Greenfield A. Carrel L. Pennisi D. Philippe C. Quaderi N. Siggers P. Steiner K. Tam P.P. Monaco A.P. Willard H.F. Koopman P. The UTX gene escapes X inactivation in mice and humans.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis within and outside of the JmjC domain (Figure 3A) (Klose et al., 2006Klose R.J. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y. JmjC-domain-containing proteins and histone demethylation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) indicates that Utx and Uty are more similar to each other than to Jmjd3. However, all three proteins contain conserved iron-binding residues (Figure 3A). The first α-KG-binding site (red # in Figure 3A) is conserved, and the second one shows a conservative Lys > Arg substitution in Jmjd3. Because of these features, Utx, Uty, and Jmjd3 are predicted to bind Fe(II) and α-KG and to possess enzymatic activity. Since some JmjC-domain-containing proteins are cytoplasmic, we first checked the subcellular localization of endogenous Jmjd3 in fractionated extracts from LPS-stimulated Raw264.7 macrophages. At all the time points analyzed Jmjd3 was found to be exclusively nuclear (Figure 3B). We were not able to detect the endogenous protein by immunostaining. However, low-level expression of transfected HA-Jmjd3 resulted in an exclusively nuclear localization and a preferential accumulation in heterochromatic compartments (Figure S1). To determine the ability of Jmjd3 to promote site-specific histone demethylation, we overexpressed HA-tagged full-length Jmjd3 in HEK293 cells and carried out a double staining with an anti-HA antibody and modification-specific antibodies recognizing individual H3 or H4 methyl lysines. Jmjd3 overexpression selectively and efficiently abrogated H3K27me3 (Figure 3C). About 75% of HA-Jmjd3-expressing cells had reduced or undetectable levels of H3K27me3, and this effect could be reproduced in other cell types (Figure S2). Expression of the C-terminal region of Jmjd3 (aa 1141–1641, corresponding to the annotated transcript AK129121), which contains the JmjC domain, was sufficient to downregulate H3K27me3 levels (Figure 3D). Mutation to Ala of His1388 in the iron-binding center abrogated Jmjd3 effects on H3K27me3, thus suggesting the requirement for iron-mediated catalysis. In spite of its high-level expression, Jmjd3 1141–1641 did not affect other methylated residues, thus indicating a remarkable level of specificity (Figure 3D). Finally, we tested the ability of recombinant Jmjd3 to catalyze H3K27me3 demethylation in vitro. Full-length Jmjd3 expressed in insect cells precipitated during the purification procedure, possibly due to the unfolding of very low complexity regions at the N terminus. Instead we were able to express in bacteria and purify to >85% purity the C terminus of Jmjd3 (aa 1141–1641) fused to a polyhistidine tag (Figure 3E). In an in vitro demethylation reaction using extractive histone H3 as substrate, Jmjd3 (1141–1641) demethylated H3K27me3 (and with lower efficiency H3K27me2) in an iron-dependent manner (Figure 3E), thus demonstrating that Jmjd3 is a bona fide histone H3K27me3 demethylase. Gene-specific reciprocal changes in H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 levels during differentiation underlie cell- and tissue-specific gene expression. H3K4me3-specific HDMs contribute to establish histone methylation patterns during differentiation (Klose et al., 2007Klose R.J. Yan Q. Tothova Z. Yamane K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Gilliland D.G. Zhang Y. Kaelin Jr., W.G. The retinoblastoma binding protein RBP2 is an H3K4 demethylase.Cell. 2007; 128: 889-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that H3K27me3 HDMs may be involved as well. Therefore we analyzed Jmjd3 behavior during macrophage differentiation. Jmjd3 was highly expressed in differentiating bone marrow cells and downregulated in differentiated macrophages (Figure 4A). Conversely, Utx was expressed at constant levels, thus indicating that as observed in macrophages Jmjd3 regulation is dynamic, while Utx behaves as a housekeeping gene. The high-level expression of Jmjd3 in differentiating bone marrow cells stimulated us to search for possible Jmjd3 targets among Hox genes, which are well-characterized targets of both the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) family of H3K4 histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and the Polycomb system and are dynamically regulated during differentiation (Sparmann and van Lohuizen, 2006Sparmann A. van Lohuizen M. Polycomb silencers control cell fate, development and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). In U-937 myelomonocytic leukemia cells genes of the “late” HoxA cluster (HoxA7–13) are kept active by association with the H3K4 HMT MLL1 (Guenther et al., 2005Guenther M.G. Jenner R.G. Chevalier B. Nakamura T. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Young R.A. Global and Hox-specific roles for the MLL1 methyltransferase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

MLL associates specifically with a subset of transcriptionally active target genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 14765-14770Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, genes of the late HoxA clusters were active in precursors and downregulated in macrophages, while HoxA1 showed the opposite behavior (Figure 4B). Both HoxA7, which in the differentiating population analyzed is the most active gene in the late HoxA cluster, and HoxA11, which is the least active one, were immunoprecipitated by the anti-Jmjd3 antibody in ChIP assays (Figure 4C). Although occupancy of HoxA7 was comparatively much more robust, binding of Jmjd3 to HoxA11 was obviously above the background measured with a control antibody (Figure 4C, bottom panel). Only background levels of a control gene (Nfkbia) were detected in the anti-Jmjd3 immunoprecipitates (Figure 4C, bottom panel). Terminal differentiation was associated with a sharp drop in Jmjd3 occupancy of both HoxA7 and HoxA11, which correlated with a 3- to 4-fold increase in H3K27me3 levels (Figure 4D) and gene inactivation. We next investigated the link between Jmjd3 and the polycomb system in LPS-activated macrophages using RNA interference (RNAi). We established an infection protocol in which retroviruses expressing the relevant short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) are used to infect bone marrow cells that proliferate and differentiate in the presence of M-CSF (Figure 5A). Cells were infected at day 1 and 2 after plating in M-CSF: a partial (50%–60%) knockdown was already observed at day 3, while in terminally differentiated macrophages knockdown efficiency was higher than 90% at the mRNA level (Figure 5B) and the protein was nearly undetectable (Figure 5C). Knockdown of Jmjd3 did not cause any obvious impairment of macrophage differentiation, judging from the normal increase of the macrophage marker F4/80 during differentiation and from the production of macrophage-specific cytokines (like IL-12b) in response to stimulation (Figure S3). However, since efficient depletion of Jmjd3 requires time and is not observed in differentiating precursors at day 3 of our protocol, we cannot rule out the possibility that macrophage differentiation requires Jmjd3 expression at early stages and/or that more subtle effects have been overlooked. Although an artificial increase in Jmjd3 levels is sufficient to erase H3K27me3 from transfected cells (Figure 3C), Jmjd3 induction in LPS-activated macrophages did not cause any detectable and reproducible reduction in H3K27me3 (Figure 5C). In a specular manner, Jmjd3 depletion did not provoke any global increase in H3K27me3, either before or after stimulation with LPS + IFNγ (Figure 5C). Stability of H3K27me3 is not due to a compensatory increase in Ezh2, whose levels remained constant (Figure S4). The lack of global effects on H3K27me3 in spite of the strong increase in Jmjd3 expression driven by LPS is likely due to the existence of mechanisms targeting Jmjd3 to a restricted number of chromatin targets, whose efficiency can be compromised only by overwhelming amounts of Jmjd3 in overexpression experiments. To identify Jmjd3 target genes we carried out microarray analysis in LPS-stimulated WT or Jmjd3-depleted primary bone marrow-derived macrophages. Only a small number of inducible transcripts showed reproducible changes (reduction or increase) in Jmjd3-depleted cells. To rule out off-target effects caused by"
https://openalex.org/W2140602911,"We sequenced and annotated the genome of the filamentous fungus Fusarium graminearum , a major pathogen of cultivated cereals. Very few repetitive sequences were detected, and the process of repeat-induced point mutation, in which duplicated sequences are subject to extensive mutation, may partially account for the reduced repeat content and apparent low number of paralogous (ancestrally duplicated) genes. A second strain of F. graminearum contained more than 10,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which were frequently located near telomeres and within other discrete chromosomal segments. Many highly polymorphic regions contained sets of genes implicated in plant-fungus interactions and were unusually divergent, with higher rates of recombination. These regions of genome innovation may result from selection due to interactions of F. graminearum with its plant hosts."

The constructs were built by culturing neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes on polydimethylsiloxane thin films micropatterned with extracellular matrix proteins to promote spatially ordered, two-dimensional myogenesis. The constructs, termed muscular thin films, adopted functional, three-dimensional conformations when released from a thermally sensitive polymer substrate and were designed to perform biomimetic tasks by varying tissue architecture, thin-film shape, and electrical-pacing protocol. These centimeter-scale constructs perform functions as diverse as gripping, pumping, walking, and swimming with fine spatial and temporal control and generating specific forces as high as 4 millinewtons per square millimeter."
https://openalex.org/W2133748952,"Adult neurogenesis occurs throughout life in discrete regions of the adult mammalian brain. Little is known about the mechanism governing the sequential developmental process that leads to integration of new neurons from adult neural stem cells into the existing circuitry. Here, we investigated roles of Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Unexpectedly, downregulation of DISC1 leads to accelerated neuronal integration, resulting in aberrant morphological development and mispositioning of new dentate granule cells in a cell-autonomous fashion. Functionally, newborn neurons with DISC1 knockdown exhibit enhanced excitability and accelerated dendritic development and synapse formation. Furthermore, DISC1 cooperates with its binding partner NDEL1 in regulating adult neurogenesis. Taken together, our study identifies DISC1 as a key regulator that orchestrates the tempo of functional neuronal integration in the adult brain and demonstrates essential roles of a susceptibility gene for major mental illness in neuronal development, including adult neurogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2002120333,"Mammalian spermatogenesis produces numerous sperm for a long period based on a highly potent stem cell system, which relies on a special microenvironment, or niche, that has not yet been identified. In this study, using time-lapse imaging of green fluorescent protein–labeled undifferentiated spermatogonia (A undiff ) and three-dimensional reconstitution, we revealed a biased localization of A undiff to the vascular network and accompanying Leydig and other interstitial cells, in intact testes. Differentiating spermatogonia left these niche regions and dispersed throughout the basal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium. Moreover, rearrangement of A undiff accompanied the vasculature alteration. We propose that the mammalian germline niche is established as a consequence of vasculature pattern formation. This is different from what is observed in Drosophila or Caenorhabditis elegans , which display developmentally specified niche structures within polarized gonads."

IRS-1 plays an important role in cell growth and cell proliferation (1Baserga R. Hall M.N. Raff M. Thomas G. Cell Growth: Control of Cell Size. 2004: 235-263Google Scholar). IRS-1, especially when activated by the IGF-IR, sends an unambiguous mitogenic, anti-apoptotic, and anti-differentiation signal (2White M.F. Mol. Cell.

IRS-1 levels are often increased in human cancer (4Chang Q. Li Y. White M.F. Fletcher J.A. Xiao S.

Conversely, down-regulation of IRS-1 (by antisense or siRNA procedures) reverses the transformed phenotype (10D'Ambrosio C. Keller S.R. Morrione A. Lienhard G.E. Baserga R. Surmacz E.

The IRS proteins are conserved during evolution, and a gene described in Drosophila, called chico, is the equivalent of IRS-1 to IRS-4 in mammalian cells. IRS proteins play an important role in cell size. Deletion of chico reduces fly weight by 65% in females and 55% in males (13Bohni R. Riesco-Escovar J. Oldham S. Brogiolo W. Stocker H. Andruss B.F.

Mice with a targeted disruption of the IRS-1 genes are also smaller than their wild-type littermates (14Pete G. Fuller G.R. Oldham J.M. Smith D.R. D'Ercole A.J. Kahn C.R. Lund P.K.

Thus, IRS-1 seems to play important roles in cell growth (cell size), cell proliferation, and differentiation. Micro RNA (miRs) are RNAs of ∼22-nucleotides long, that arise from one arm of longer endogenous hairpin transcripts. The characteristics of miRs have been summarized in several reviews (16Lee R.C. Ambros V. Science. 2001; 294: 862-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar, 17Ke X.S. Liu C.M. Liu D.P. Liang C.C. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6156-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, miRs are cleaved from one arm of a longer endogenous double-stranded precursor (70–100 nt in length) by Drosha and Dicer enzymes (RNase III family). They are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (20Lee Y. Kim M. Han J. Yeom K.H. Lee S. Baek S.H. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4051-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (3288) Google Scholar) as long primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs), which are cropped and cleaved to produce the pre-miR and the mature miR (21Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (4026) Google Scholar). They are complementary to genomic regions, and one of their modes of action is to bind to the 3′-untranslated regions of mRNA (3′-UTR), inhibiting translation (the target mRNA levels remain unchanged). They can function also by cleaving a target mRNA, in which case the miR may target sequences outside the 3′-UTR (18Lai E.C. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R925-R936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). miRs play crucial roles in eukaryotic gene regulation, especially in development and differentiation (22Krichevsky A.M.

Prisco M. Calin G. Liu C g. Russo G Giordano. A Baserga R.. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 706-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A few reports have tied miRs to cancer (26Michael M.Z. O'Connor S.M. van Host Pellekaan N.G. Young G.P. James R.J. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 882-891PubMed Google Scholar, 27Iorio M.V. Ferracin M. Liu C.G. Verones A. Spizzo R. Sabbioni S. Magri E.

Targets of miRs can be obtained from the data base (see below), although it is understood that the presumed targets have to be validated experimentally. We first screened some data base candidates for IRS-1 targeting, and we then focused on a single miR (miR145) testing it for its ability to down-regulate IRS-1 in cells in culture. We show that synthetic oligonucleotides (oligos) of miR145 cause down-regulation of the IRS-1 protein in human colon cancer cells and that its effect is slightly less pronounced than the effect of an siRNA against IRS-1. Whereas the siRNA causes a down-regulation of IRS-1 mRNA, miR145 does not, indicating that the effect is probably on translation. A reporter gene carrying the 3′-UTR or the miR145 binding sites of IRS-1 is also down-regulated by miR145, while an IRS-1 cDNA without its 3′-UTR is not affected. Finally, an expression plasmid expressing a hairpin precursor miR145 also down-regulates IRS-1 when transfected into colon cancer cells. Although siRNA is more effective than miR145 in down-regulating IRS-1 levels, miR145 and siRNA have similar inhibitory effects on the growth of colon cancer cells in culture; in fact, in some experiments miR145 was more potent than siRNA in inhibiting cell proliferation. This is probably because miRs target multiple proteins along the same pathway (31Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A. Schelter J.M. Castle J. Bartel D.P. Linsley P.S. Johnson J.M. Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (4026) Google Scholar, 32Cui Q. Yu Z. Purisima E.O. Wang E. Mol. Systems Biol. 2006; 2: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Indeed, miR145 targets also the IGF-IR (see below). Taken together, these results demonstrate that miR145 targets the 3′-UTR of IRS-1 mRNA, and that the targeting has a profound effect on the growth of human colon cancer cells. This is the first demonstration of a specific miR targeting a transduction molecule of the IGF-IR/insulin receptor signaling pathway. Its inhibition of growth in human cancer cells in culture is compatible with the well known ability of IRS-1 to stimulate cell proliferation and transformation (see above). Cells—Colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116-Dicer-KO 2 and DLD1-Dicer-KO 4 were kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (33Cummins J.M. He Y. Leary R.J. Pagliarini R. Diaz Jr., L.A. Sjoblom T. Barad O.

All cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. In the Dicer-KO cells, the exon 5 of the Dicer gene encoding helicase is replaced by a neoR gene. BT-20, a human breast cancer cell line, was from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. R+ and R12 cells (34Reiss K. Valentinis B. Tu X. Xu S.Q. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were generated from R-cells, which are 3T3-like mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with a targeted disruption of endogenous IGF-IR genes. R+ and R12 cells are R– cells stably transfected with a plasmid expressing human IGF1R. R+ has 300-fold more IGF1R (9 × 105 receptors) than R12 (3 × 103 receptors). R+ cells grow in serum-free medium supplemented solely with IGF-I, whereas R12 do not. Both cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum + penicillin/streptomycin medium. Double Strand Oligos and Transfection—The ds-oligos miR145, miR148a, miR207, and miR154 as well as miR negative control were purchased from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). SmartPool siRNA against human IRS-1 was purchased from Upstate (Millipore, Charlottesville, VA). The ds-oligos (50 nm) and plasmid DNAs (800 ng/ml) were transfected into parental and Dicer-KO cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 6-well plates according to the manufacturer's instructions. TaqMan Real Time RT-PCR—Messenger RNAs of IRS-1 were extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). miRNAs were extracted using Micro RNA Isolation kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or mirVana miRNA Isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Primers and probes specific for human IRS-1 and internal control 18S rRNA were purchased from Applied Biosystems (ABI, Framingham, MA). TaqMan One-step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagents kit (ABI, Roche, Branchburg, NJ) was used to detect IRS-1 mRNA. Amplification and detection was performed using 7900HT Sequence Detection System (ABI), using 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C (15 s) and annealing/extension at 60 °C (60 s). This was preceded by reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min and denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min. To quantitate mature miRNA, TaqMan® MicroRNA Assays kits were purchased from ABI to detect miR145 (cat. 4373133) and a control miR (RNU6B, cat. 4373381). It is a two-step protocol requiring reverse transcription (cat. 4366596) with a miRNA-specific primer, followed by real time PCR with TaqMan ® probes (cat. 4324018). The assays target only mature microRNAs, not their precursors, ensuring biologically relevant results. The fold change of target gene in treatment groups relative to mock-treated samples were calculated according to the ABI Relative Quantification Methodology. The absolute miR145 levels in parental HCT116 and HCT116-Dicer-KO cells were also calculated according to a standard curve of miR145 (Dharmacon hsa-miR145 ds-oligo served as the standard). For details, refer to the ABI user's bulletin: Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression: ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System: User Bulletin 2: Rev B. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blots were performed to confirm the expression levels of miR145. 10–20 μg of total RNA were separated on a 15% denaturing TBE-urea mini-gel (Invitrogen) and then electroblotted onto Hybond N+ nylon filter (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled (by polynucleotide kinase, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) oligonucleotide probes for miR145 were hybridized to the filter in Rapidhyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences). The probe, antisense oligo against mature miR145 (5′-AAGGGATTCCTGGGAAAACTGGAC) was synthesized by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) 28S, 18S, and 5S on the gels stained with ethidium bromide served as loading controls. Western Blots—Cell pellets were collected at different time points (24-, 48-, and 96-h post-transfection) for protein extraction using radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and complete mini-protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Bio-Rad gel (4–15% Tris-HCl, cat. 161-1158) and gel running (cat. 161-0072)/transferring (cat. 161-0771) system was used to separate IRS-1 proteins, detected by anti-IRS-1 polyclonal antibody against IRS-1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). GAPDH served as internal control (mouse anti-rabbit GAPDH, Research Diagnostics Inc). Luciferase Assay—Dual luciferase vector psiCHECK2 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). HCT116-Dicer-KO 2 cells were seeded in 96-well plate. The cells were transfected with different psiCHECK2 constructs containing 3′-UTR of human IRS-1 or miR145 potential binding sites (see supplemental data), in the presence or absence of miR145 (Dharmacon). 48 h later, the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed using Dual-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega) in Tecan Safire Microplate Reader II. Because all the miR potential binding sequences were cloned at the 3′ of Renilla luciferase gene, the ratio of the luminescent signals from Renilla versus firefly represents the target specificity of miRs. All experiments were performed in triplicate, i.e. 3 wells for each condition. The potential binding sites of miR145 on the 3′-UTR of human IRS-1 were cloned into multiclonal sites (MCS) of a dual luciferase vector psiCHECK2 (Promega). Double strand oligos (listed under supplemental materials) were generated by annealing sense and antisense strands, and further ligated into psiCHECK2 digested with XhoI and NotI. The following primers were designed to RT-PCR the 3′-UTR of human IRS-1 from total RNA extracted from HCT116 cells. This RT-PCR product is about 1 kb, and covers the entire 3′-UTR of IRS-1 mRNA. XhoI-3UTR primer: ccgCTCGAGCTCAACTGGACATCACAGCAG; NotI-3UTR-primer: ttGCGGCCGCTAAAAGATCAACAGTATCTAGTTTA. The corresponding clones were called psiCHECK2–145 site 1(clone 81), psiCHECK2-145 site 2 (clone 83), psiCHECK2-145 sites 1 + 2 (clone 85), and psiCHECK2-entire3UTR_1kb (clone 75). The forward and reverse sequencing primers according to psiCHECK2 sequence around MCS were designed and synthesized by IDT to confirm the clones. The Forward sequencing primer was called hRluc_Fd_1610-1629 (5′-TGCTGAAGAACGAGCAGTAA) and the reverse primer was called pTK_Rs_1744-1763 (5′-CGAGGTCCGAAGACTCATTT). The truncated IRS-1 ∼3-kb fragment, which contains 5′-UTR and a truncated mouse IRS-1 gene (about 859 amino acid residues instead of a full-length IRS-1 protein, 1232 amino acids) was cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The resulting vector was called pcDNA3.1-truncated mIRS-1. Plasmids—The pSuper.retro.neo.GFP plasmid (abbreviated pSuper) was purchased from Oligoengine. It is controlled by a 5′-LTR, has a variety of restriction sites for insertion, and the transfected cells can be selected either by neomycin or GFP (FACS sorter). It has been tested by Cimmino et al.

Double strand-oligo inserts, ∼70-nt hairpin stem loop pre-miR145 plus 20, 40, 80, or promoter + 160 nt flanking sequences at each side of hairpin, were PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA (Promega, G3041) and cloned into BglII and HindIII sites of pSuper. The resulting constructs were called pSuper-hairpin145_20nt (clone 26), pSuper-hairpin145_40nt (clone 28), pSuper-hairpin145_80nt (clone 30), and pSuper-hairpin145_160nt (clone 32). The sequences of the inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing using primers suggested by OligoEngine (Seattle, WA). The mature miR145 (24 nt) was also directly cloned into pSuper. The resulting clones are called pSuper-mature145_24nt (clone 18). All the above primers for PCR and cloning are listed under supplemental materials. Data Base—miR target genes were screened with the Target Scan program, the miRanda program, miRBase, and miRNAMap. The targets were confirmed by BLAST alignment with the corresponding NCBI DNA data base for homologies between miRs and their targets. Potential IRS-1-specific miRs—The data base identified several miRs as targeting IRS-1, and selected candidates are listed in Fig. 1, panel A. The structure of the IRS-1 pre-mRNA is unusual and relevant to the experiments described below. The pre-mRNA structure (NCBI for NM_010570, GeneID: 16367. Locus tag: MGI:99454) is given in panel B. In terms of 3′-UTR, the IRS-1 mRNA has an exon of 4,640 bp, with the coding region extending from residue 924 to residue 4619. Then the 3′-UTR begins (21 bp), interrupted by an intron of 49,172 bp, and completed by an additional 995 bp of 3′-UTR. Fig. 1, panel C, gives a more detailed presentation of the 3′-UTR of the IRS-1 cDNA, with the two putative binding sites for miR145. One binding site is in the 21-bp sequence immediately after the stop codon, while the 2nd binding site is separated from the first (in the genome) by almost 50,000 bp. HCT116 and DLD1 Cells—Parental HCT116 and DLD1 cells are both colon carcinoma cell lines frequently used in research. HCT116-Dicer-KO and DLD1-KO cells, both kind gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University), are HCT116 and DLD1 cells in which exon 5 of the Dicer gene (the helicase domain) has been disrupted (33Cummins J.M. He Y. Leary R.J. Pagliarini R. Diaz Jr., L.A. Sjoblom T. Barad O. Bentwich Z. Szafranska A.E. Labourier E. Raymond C.K. Roberts B.S. Juhl H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Velculescu V.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3687-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Because Dicer is required for proper processing of mature miRs, these cells have markedly reduced amounts of mature miRs and display accumulation of miR precursors. The low levels of mature miR145 in HCT116-KO cells, in comparison to parental cells, are shown in Fig. 2, panel A. Actually, miR145 cannot be detected in either parental or HCT116-KO cells by Northern blot (data not shown), and can only be detected by TaqMan. Fig. 2, panel B, shows IRS-1 protein levels in selected cell lines. IRS-1 levels are slightly higher in HCT116-KO cells than in parental HCT116 cells (GAPDH levels monitor protein loading). We have included in this Western blot lysates of R+ and R12 cells, mouse embryo fibroblasts known to have substantial levels of IRS-1 (34Reiss K. Valentinis B. Tu X. Xu S.Q. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) as well as BT-20 mammary cancer cells, that do not express IRS-1 at all (8DeAngelis T. Chen J. Wu A. Prisco M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and serve as the negative control. Fig. 2, panel C, shows that both HCT116 and DLD1 KO cells can be transfected efficiently with a synthetic oligo of miR145 (Dharmacon). We also transfected the miR148a oligos into both HCT116-KO and DLD1-KO cells as negative controls for the Northern blot with labeled miR145 probe (transfected miR148a could be detected after transfection, with the appropriate miR148a probe, data not shown). For subsequent studies, we used mostly HCT116-KO cells, designated from now on as KO cells, to screen several synthetic oligos for their ability to decrease IRS-1 levels. miR145 Down-regulates the IRS-1 Protein in KO Cells—In early experiments, we determined the effects of miR oligos at 24 and 48 h after transfection. The results were inconclusive (not shown), and we decided to try longer time points, given the half-life of the IRS-1 protein (12Cesarone G. Garofalo C. Abrams M.T. Igoucheva O. Alexeev V. Yoon K. Surmacz E. Wickstrom E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 98: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that miR145 decreases IRS-1 levels 96 h after transfection. There are other miRs (predicted from the data base) that down-regulate IRS-1, i.e. miR154 and miR207. miR148a was also predicted to target IRS-1, but, in these experiments, failed to decrease IRS-1 levels. miR145 and miR207 oligos down-regulated IRS-1 in parental HCT116 cells, KO HCT cells and KO DLD1 cells. miR154 was effective only on the first 2 cell lines. An siRNA against IRS-1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) was more effective than miR145 in down-regulating IRS-1 protein levels, especially in parental cells. Fig. 4, panel A, shows repeated experiments in which KO HCT116 cells were transfected with the miR145 oligo, in four separate experiments. In all of them, 96 h after transfection, the levels of IRS-1 protein were significantly lower than in untreated or mock-transfected KO cells. miR145 also down-regulates the IGF-IR (Fig. 4, panel A), although to a lesser extent than IRS-1. IRS-2 expression is not decreased (supplemental data), as expected from the data base, indicating that IRS-2 is not targeted by miR145. In this communication, we have focused on miR145 and its targeting of IRS-1.FIGURE 4Effect of miR145 and siRNA on IRS-1 levels at various times after transfection. Panel A, repeated experiments in which synthetic miR145 oligos were transfected into HCT116-Dicer-KO cells. Western blot for IRS-1 after 96 h. The middle band shows the unchanged levels of the control GAPDH. The lower band shows that the expression of the α+β subunits of the IGF-IR is also affected. Panel B, effect of miR145 oligos and siRNA against IRS-1 on IRS-1 levels. The left panel shows that, with siRNA, IRS-1 levels are only slightly decreased 24 h after transfection. 5 days after transfection, siRNA is more effective than miR145 in down-regulating IRS-1 levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We compared the effect of miR145 to the effect of siRNA against IRS-1 on IRS-1 levels. This is shown in Fig. 4, panel B, where we measured IRS-1 protein levels 24 h and 5 days after transfection. siRNA is more efficient than miR145 in down-regulating IRS-1 protein levels. Notice that at 24 h after transfection, even the siRNA has only a moderate effect on IRS-1 levels (left panel of panel B). IRS-1 mRNA Levels Are Not Down-regulated by miR145—It is generally agreed that in the majority of cases, miRs act by inhibiting translation, although in some cases, they may cause breakdown of the mRNA (see Introduction). We tested the levels of IRS-1 mRNA in KO cells transfected with either miR145 oligos or siRNA/IRS-1, and compared it to control cells (untreated or mock-transfected). The results (by TaqMan real-time RT-PCR) of repeated experiments are summarized in Fig. 5. As expected, siRNA markedly decreases IRS-1 levels, but these remain constant in cells transfected with miR145 synthetic oligos. In fact, there was a small increase of IRS-1 mRNA in cells transfected with the miR oligo. The increase at 96 h was actually statistically significant. These experiments show that miR145 down-regulates the IRS-1 protein, but not the mRNA. miR145 Down-regulates a Reporter Gene with Sequences from the 3′-UTR of IRS-1—To confirm that miR145 targets the 3′-UTR of IRS-1, we carried out experiments used by other investigators to determine the specificity of the 3′-UTR targeting (36Wu L. Belasco J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9198-9208Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 37Fazi F. Rosa A. Fatica A. Gelmetti V. DeMarchis M.L. Nervi C. Bozzoni I.

The general approach has been to insert the 3′-UTR in question at the 3′-end of a reporter gene, often luciferase (36Wu L. Belasco J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9198-9208Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We followed the same protocol, and made four different constructs in which luciferase was expressed with the 3′-UTR of IRS-1 (full-length) or with the presumed binding sites of miR145 to the 3′-UTR of IRS-1 cDNA (see Fig. 1). One construct had the 1st putative binding site for miR145, a 2nd construct had the 2nd putative binding site, and the final construct had both binding sites (see Fig. 1). The constructs were then co-transfected with miR145 oligos, with cells transfected only with the constructs serving as the controls. The results of a typical experiment are shown in Fig. 6. There was a significant decrease in the expression of the luciferase reporter in cells co-transfected with miR145 oligos and the luciferase carrying the full-length 3′-UTR of IRS-1 or a 3′-UTR containing the two presumed binding sites of 3′-UTR for miR145. The constructs in which luciferase had only one binding site for miR145 were also slightly decreased, but to a lesser extent. The results were subjected to a two-tailed t test. The decrease in luciferase in the cells with the 3′-UTR or the two miR145 binding sites were significant (p < 0.05). The decreases for the constructs with only one binding site were p = 0.6 and therefore not significant. The data in Fig. 6 come from a single experiment (n = 3), although the experiment was repeated three times, with the same results. IRS-1 without"
https://openalex.org/W2014243367,"Fossil evidence for changes in dinosaurs near the lineage leading to birds and the origin of flight has been sparse. A dinosaur from Mongolia represents the basal divergence within Dromaeosauridae. The taxon's small body size and phylogenetic position imply that extreme miniaturization was ancestral for Paraves (the clade including Avialae, Troodontidae, and Dromaeosauridae), phylogenetically earlier than where flight evolution is strongly inferred. In contrast to the sustained small body sizes among avialans throughout the Cretaceous Period, the two dinosaurian lineages most closely related to birds, dromaeosaurids and troodontids, underwent four independent events of gigantism, and in some lineages size increased by nearly three orders of magnitude. Thus, change in theropod body size leading to flight's origin was not unidirectional."

However, the role of HSP60, a mitochondrial matrix protein, is somewhat controversial with both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic functions reported. Here we show that in numerous apoptotic systems HSP60 protein accumulates in the cytosol. In BMD188-induced cell death, HSP60 accumulates in the cytosol with significant mitochondrial release. In contrast, in apoptosis induced by multiple other inducers, the cytosolic HSP60 accumulates without an apparent mitochondrial release. The short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown experiments revealed that in BMD188-induced apoptosis, HSP60 has a pro-death function and that the pro-death role of HSP60 seems to involve caspase-3 maturation and activation in the cytosol. In contrast, HSP60 appears to play a pro-survival role in other apoptotic systems where there is no apparent mitochondrial release as its knockdown promotes cell death. In these latter apoptotic systems HSP60 does not associate with active caspase-3. In both cases, HSP60 does not appreciably interact with Bax. Taken together, our results suggest the following: 1) cytosolic accumulation of HSP60 represents a common phenomenon during apoptosis induction; 2) cytosolic HSP60 accumulation during apoptosis occurs either with or without apparent mitochondrial release; and 3) the cytosolically accumulated HSP60 possesses either pro-survival or pro-death functions, which involves differential interactions with caspase-3.

They were initially identified as proteins whose expression is induced upon heat treatment. Subsequent to their discovery, they have been shown to be induced not only by elevated temperature but also by a wide array of stresses and to play critical pro-survival functions in “stressed” cells (1Beere H.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2633-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Upon heat or other stress stimulation, HSPs are induced by the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (2Baler R. Kim G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Most HSPs play a protective role and hence promote cell survival during apoptosis (3Beere H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2641-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is governed by two major pathways, the intrinsic pathway that involves the mitochondria and the extrinsic pathway that involves death receptors. The final outcome is the activation of procaspases and cleavage of caspase substrates resulting in the characteristic membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation. HSP27, -70, and -90 have been shown to promote survival of the cells stimulated by UV radiation (4Simon M.M. Kim A. Schwarz A. Krone C. Luger T.A. Jaattela M. Schwarz T. J. Clin.

J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2633-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). They work by either inhibiting the release of apoptotic factors like cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), or Smac from the mitochondria or by inhibiting the activated caspases. Consistent with their purported pro-survival functions, many HSPs are overexpressed in various cancers, including prostate cancer (11Cornford P.A. Kim A.R. Parsons K.F. Desmond A.D. Woolfenden A.

Unlike HSP27, -70, and -90 with obvious pro-survival functions, HSP60 appears to have both pro-survival and pro-death functions. HSP60 is a resident of the mitochondrial matrix, and it facilitates the folding of newly translated mitochondrial proteins transported into the mitochondrial matrix via the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane translocation machinery. It is a homologue of the prokaryotic chaperone GroEL and complexes with HSP10, a homologue of the prokaryotic GroES (16Richardson A. Kim S.J. Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 138-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In complex with HSP10, it provides a secluded environment optimal for the unfolded or misfolded protein intermediates to return to their native conformation. Several experiments have implicated HSP60 in protecting cardiac myocytes during hypoxia possibly by complexing with Bax and preventing its translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane (17Kirchhoff S.R. Kim S. Knowlton A.A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2899-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 18Lin K.M. Kim B. Lian I.Y. Mestril R. Scheffler I.E. Dillmann W.H. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1787-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). HSP60 also protects epithelial cells from stress-induced death through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and inhibition of caspase 3 (19Zhang L. Kim S. Uitto V.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 292: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently, HSP60 has been shown to confer neuroprotection (20Chan J.Y. Kim H.L. Chou J.L. Li F.C. Dai K.Y. Chan S.H. Chang A.Y.

Another piece of evidence supporting a potential pro-survival role of HSP60 is its up-regulation in several cancers, including prostate (11Cornford P.A. Kim A.R. Parsons K.F. Desmond A.D. Woolfenden A. Fordham M. Neoptolemos J.P. Ke Y. Foster C.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 7099-7105PubMed Google Scholar), colorectal (23Cappello F. Kim S. Rappa F. Bucchieri F. Marasa L. Bartolotta T.E.

Righetti P.G. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 3246-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). On the other hand, data exist supporting a death-promoting function for HSP60. Studies in Jurkat and HeLa cells demonstrated that HSP60 complexes with procaspase-3 and serves to accelerate the maturation of procaspase-3 by upstream activator caspases during apoptosis (26Xanthoudakis S.

Jones D.P. Orrenius S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In addition, positive HSP60 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (15Faried A. Kim M. Nakajima M. Miyazaki T. Kato H. Kuwano H. Eur. J. Cancer. 2004; 40: 2804-2811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as well as ovarian cancer (28Schneider J. Kim E. Marenbach K. Romero H. Marx D. Meden H. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 2141-2146PubMed Google Scholar) correlates with good prognosis for the patients. By contrast, loss of HSP60 expression is associated with the risk of developing an infiltrating recurrent bladder cancer (29Lebret T. Kim R.W. Molinie V. O'Neill A. Gabriel C. Fitzpatrick J.M. Botto H. Cancer. 2003; 98: 970-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a pro-apoptotic and beneficial effect of HSP60 in these cancer cells in vivo. Thus the role of HSP60 during apoptosis might vary with different tissues, cell types, and apoptotic inducers. Here we study subcellular changes of HSP60, its potential roles, and potential underlying mechanisms for its involvement in apoptosis. Cells and Reagents—PC3 and LNCaP (prostate), GM701 (fibroblast), MDA-MB231 (breast), and HCT116 (colon) cancer cells were cultured as described previously (30Chandra D. Kim G. Deng X. Bhatia B.

To prepare whole cell lysate, cells were treated, harvested with trypsin-EDTA, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitor mixture. After 30 min of incubation on ice with intermittent vortexing, cleared whole cell lysate (i.e. the supernatant) was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min. For Western blotting, 35 μg of proteins was loaded in each lane of a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis and protein transfer, the membrane was probed and reprobed with various primary and corresponding secondary antibodies. For immunoprecipitation samples, Western blotting was performed using the TrueBlot System (eBioscience). Briefly, TrueBlot secondary antibodies were used at 1:1000 for detection of primary antibody with minimal nonspecific binding to the heavy and light chains of the antibodies used in immunoprecipitation. Quantification of Apoptotic Nuclei Using DAPI Staining of Live Cells—Cells were plated on glass coverslips, treated with various inducers, and incubated live with DAPI (31Chandra D. Kim G.

The percentage of cells exhibiting apoptotic nuclei, as judged by chromatin condensation or nuclear fragmentation, was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. An average of 600–700 cells were counted for each condition. DEVDase Activity Measurement—Cells were lysed and incubated with fluorogenic peptide substrate, DEVD-AFC, and reduction of AFC was monitored in a spectrofluorimeter (32Chandra D. Kim J.W. Tang D.G.

Immunofluorescence Analysis of HSP60 Subcellular Distribution during Apoptosis—Cells grown on coverslips were treated and then fixed, permeabilized, and immunolabeled for HSP60, using protocols previously described (30Chandra D.

Real Time PCR Analysis of HSP60 mRNA Expression—Total RNA was isolated from control or treated cells using the RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen. 600 ng of total RNA from each sample was used for reverse transcription using the High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems). 1 μl of the 20-μl cDNA reaction was utilized for real time PCR ran on the 7900HT real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Taqman gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) for human HSP60 (assay ID, Hs01866140_g1) and GAPDH (assay ID, Hs99999905_m1) with 6-carboxy-fluorescein-labeled probes were employed in separate reactions to determine HSP60 expression compared with GAPDH expression in each sample. The 114-bp amplicon for HSP60 lies on chromosome 12 between 198176816 and 198177428 within exon 12 of the gene, whereas the 122-bp amplicon of GAPDH lies on chromosome 12 between 6515921 and 6516020 within exon 3 of the gene. The results were then processed, and HSP60 gene expression was normalized first to GAPDH expression within each sample and then to the no-treatment control of each group. siRNA Down-regulation of HSP60—siGENOME SMARTpool for HSP60 (catalog number M-010600-02, which contains four siRNAs targeting hsp60 mRNA) and siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA (i.e. cont-siRNA) were obtained from Dharmacon. Cells, plated a day earlier on 6-well culture dishes to achieve 50–60% confluence, were transfected with HSP60-siRNApool or cont-siRNA (100 nm each), using DharmaFECT reagent 1 for GM701, reagent 2 for PC3, and reagent 3 for LNCaP cells. HCT116 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine. Forty eight h after transfection, cells were treated with various apoptotic inducers as indicated. At the end of treatment, cells were harvested for apoptosis analysis. Gel Filtration Analyses—PC3 and HCT116 cells were treated with BMD188 and anti-Fas antibody, respectively.

GM701, PC3, LNCaP, or HCT116 cells (treated or untreated) were lysed, precleared with mouse, rabbit, or goat (depending on the primary antibodies used) IgG-conjugated agarose beads, and incubated with primary antibodies against HSP60, Bax, or caspase 3, or RgIgG (as control), followed by addition of goat, rabbit, or mouse IgG beads. Finally, the beads were pelleted, washed thoroughly, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by TrueBlot Western blotting system (eBioscience).

For pulldown assays, recombinant HSP60 (1 μm) and procaspase-3 (90 nm) were incubated in homogenizing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 2 h at 37 °C.

At the end, samples were used for DEVDase assay and Western blot. In BMD118-induced PC3 and GM701 Cell Apoptosis, HSP60 Rapidly Accumulates in the Cytosol Accompanied by Mitochondrial Release—Our laboratory has been routinely utilizing three apoptotic systems, i.e. various cells treated with BMD188, LNCaP prostate cancer cells deprived of serum, and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells treated with etoposide, to dissect the molecular mechanisms dictating the pro-survival versus pro-death fate of the stimulated cells (30Chandra D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50842-50854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we observed that HSP60 accumulated in the cytosol of cells early during apoptosis induction. This prompted us to determine here whether this might represent a general phenomenon during apoptosis. We started by treating PC3 cells (prostate cancer; Fig. 1A) or GM701 (transformed human fibroblast; Fig. 1B) with BMD188. BMD188 is a fatty acid-containing hydroxamic acid that induces potent cell death at low micromolar concentrations (35Joshi B. Kim L. Taffe B.G. Zhu Z. Wahl S. Tian H. Ben-Josef E. Taylor J.D. Porter A.T. Tang D.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4343-4355PubMed Google Scholar, 36Li L. Kim Z. Joshi B. Porter Tang D. G. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 51-60PubMed Google Scholar). This compound was initially synthesized as a 12-li-poxygenase inhibitor; however, its apoptosis-inducing effect is independent of 12-lipoxygenase and seems to involve mitochondrial activation (35Joshi B.

Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 51-60PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms of action for the BMD188 compound remains to be characterized. In our experiments involving BMD188, cells were generally treated with 40 μm BMD188 and then harvested and fractionated into the cytosol and mitochondria. As before (30Chandra D. Kim G. Deng X. Bhatia B. Daniel P. Tang D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6592-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 31Chandra D. Kim G. Daniel P.T. Tang D.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 17408-17420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we first characterized the relative purities of both fractions. The results revealed that the cytosolic marker lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was detected only in the cytosolic preparations, and the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (Cox II) was detected only in the mitochondrial preparations (Fig. 1, A and B). Another mitochondrial marker, voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (31Chandra D. Kim G. Daniel P.T. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19051-19061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), was also detected exclusively in the mitochondria (see Fig. 2A). These results demonstrate that our subcellular fractions are relatively pure without significant cross-contamination.FIGURE 2Cytosolic accumulation of HSP60 in the absence of obvious mitochondrial release. PC3 cells were treated with STS (A) or Dox (B), or GM701 cells were treated with STS (C) or Dox or Taxol (D) for the time intervals indicated. Equal amounts of cytosol (cyto) and mitochondria (mito) (35 μg/lane) were used in Western blotting to probe for the molecules indicated on the right. NS, nonspecific band(s) used as loading control. Apoptosis was determined by procaspase-3 (pro-C3) cleavage (to p20/p17 bands), quantifying apoptotic nuclear morphology upon DAPI staining (A), or by measuring DEVDase activity (B–D). Note that in all cases Cox II was detected only in the mitochondria.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then focused on the changes of HSP60 in BMD188-treated cells and also compared changes in HSP60 with alterations of several other mitochondrial proteins. Both PC3 (Fig. 1A) and GM701 cells (Fig. 1B) normally expressed HSP60 mainly in the mitochondria. Treatment with BMD188 for as short as 5–30 min resulted in a prominent decrease in the mitochondrial HSP60 with a concomitant increase in the cytosolic HSP60 (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that BMD188 induced HSP60 protein release from the mitochondria to the cytosol. By 15 min in PC3 and 4 h in GM701 cells, there was very little HSP60 remaining in the mitochondria (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas the cytosolic amount of HSP60 leveled out. In PC3 cells, alterations in subcellular distribution of HSP60 temporally coincided with those of cytochrome c, a mitochondrial inter-membrane space protein, which also showed rapid translocation to the cytosol (Fig. 1A). By contrast, Smac, a protein also localized in the inter-membrane space, showed minimal changes in its subcellular distribution in BMD188-treated PC3 cells (Fig. 1A). AIF was localized exclusively in the mitochondria in PC3 cells, and BMD188 stimulation did not induce its release (Fig. 1A). The translocation of HSP60 from the mitochondria to the cytosol in BMD188-treated PC3 cells was observed much earlier than obvious cell death, which occurred around 1–2 h after stimulation as revealed by caspase-3 activation (i.e. the appearance of active caspase-3 cleavage product, p20 and p17) (31Chandra D.

https://openalex.org/W2042027177,"The direct observation of molecular dynamics initiated by x-rays has been hindered to date by the lack of bright femtosecond sources of short-wavelength light. We used soft x-ray beams generated by high-harmonic upconversion of a femtosecond laser to photoionize a nitrogen molecule, creating highly excited molecular cations. A strong infrared pulse was then used to probe the ultrafast electronic and nuclear dynamics as the molecule exploded. We found that substantial fragmentation occurs through an electron-shakeup process, in which a second electron is simultaneously excited during the soft x-ray photoionization process. During fragmentation, the molecular potential seen by the electron changes rapidly from nearly spherically symmetric to a two-center molecular potential. Our approach can capture in real time and with angstrom resolution the influence of ionizing radiation on a range of molecular systems, probing dynamics that are inaccessible with the use of other techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2042046341,"Discrete control of individual dopant or impurity atoms is critical to the electrical characteristics and fabrication of silicon nanodevices. The unavoidable introduction of defects into silicon during the implantation process may prevent the uniform distribution of dopant atoms. Cottrell atmospheres are one such nonuniformity and occur when interstitial atoms interact with dislocations, pinning the dislocation and trapping the interstitial. Atom probe tomography has been used to quantify the location and elemental identity of the atoms proximate to defects in silicon. We found that Cottrell atmospheres of arsenic atoms form around defects after ion implantation and annealing. Furthermore, these atmospheres persist in surrounding dislocation loops even after considerable thermal treatment. If not properly accommodated, these atmospheres create dopant fluctuations that ultimately limit the scalability of silicon devices."

Evidence is also accumulating that CTCF is involved in large scale organization of genomic chromatin. Although CTCF has 11 zinc fingers, we show here that only 4 of these are essential to strong binding and that they recognize a core 12-bp DNA sequence common to most CTCF sites. By deleting individual fingers and mutating individual sites, we determined the orientation of binding. Furthermore, we were able to identify the specific finger and its point of DNA interaction that are responsible for the loss of CTCF binding when CpG residues are methylated in the imprinted Igf2/H19 locus. This single interaction appears to be critical for allele-specific binding and insulation by CTCF."

https://openalex.org/W2147981309,"Osteoarthritis (OA), the most prevalent form of skeletal disease, represents a leading cause of disability following middle age. OA is characterized by the loss of articular cartilage; however, the details of its etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Recently, we demonstrated a genetic association between the cartilage extracellular matrix protein asporin and OA (Kizawa, H., Kou, I., Iida, A., Sudo, A., Miyamoto, Y., Fukuda, A., Mabuchi, A., Kotani, A., Kawakami, A., Yamamoto, S., Uchida, A., Nakamura, K., Notoya, K., Nakamura, Y., and Ikegawa, S. (2005) Nat. Genet. 37, 138-144). Furthermore, we showed that asporin binds to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a key cytokine in OA pathogenesis, and inhibits TGF-β-induced chondrogenesis. To date, functional data for asporin have come primarily from mouse cell culture models of developing cartilage rather than from human articular cartilage cells, in which OA occurs. Here, we describe mechanisms for asporin function and regulation in human articular cartilage. Asporin blocks chondrogenesis and inhibits TGF-β1-induced expression of matrix genes and the resulting chondrocyte phenotypes. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of asporin increases the expression of cartilage marker genes and TGF-β1; in turn, TGF-β1 stimulates asporin expression in articular cartilage cells, suggesting that asporin and TGF-β1 form a regulatory feedback loop. Asporin inhibits TGF-β/Smad signaling upstream of TGF-β type I receptor activation in vivo by co-localizing with TGF-β1 on the cell surface and blocking its interaction with the TGF-β type II receptor. Our results provide a basis for elucidating the role of asporin in the molecular pathogenesis of OA."

We have found that PARP1 interaction with chromatin is dynamic and that PARP1 is exchanged continuously between chromatin and nucleoplasm, as well as between chromatin domains. Specifically, the PARP1 protein preferentially interacts with nucleosomal particles, and although the nucleosomal linker DNA is not necessary for this interaction, we have shown that the core histones, H3 and H4, are critical for PARP1 binding. We have also demonstrated that the histones H3 and H4 interact preferentially with the C-terminal portion of PARP1 protein and that the N-terminal domain of PARP1 negatively regulates these interactions. Finally, we have found that interaction with the N-terminal tail of the H4 histone triggers PARP1 enzymatic activity. Therefore, our data collectively suggests a model in which both the regulation of PARP1 protein binding to chromatin and the enzymatic activation of PARP1 protein depend on the dynamics of nucleosomal core histone mediation.

Notwithstanding these findings, major gaps in our present understanding exist that involve the mechanism by which the PARP1 protein binds to specific chromatin domains and the mechanism by which the local PARP1 protein is activated in response to developmental and environmental stimuli. After histones, PARP1 is the most abundant nuclear protein (4Virag L. Kim C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 375-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar).

Nevertheless, exactly how the PARP1 enzyme interacts with chromatin in vivo has not been thoroughly investigated, and the molecular basis for PARP1 binding to chromatin remains poorly understood. Although zinc fingers within the PARP1 protein contribute to DNA binding in vitro, they specifically recognize damaged DNA (6Gradwohl G. Kim J.M. Molinete M. Simonin F. Koken M.

This idea is, however, complicated by the fact that Drosophila histone H1 was recently reported as an antagonist of PARP1 binding to chromatin (3Kim M.Y. Kim S. Gevry N. Lis J. T. Kraus W. L. Cell. 2004; 119: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In addition, accumulation of PARP1 interactors, which have to date been identified through in vitro experiments, has resulted in findings suggesting that almost none significantly co-localizes with PARP1 in chromatin. To clarify the many issues involved with PARP1 protein binding activity to chromatin and the activation of its enzymatic activity, we sought an appropriate experimental model. As both an organismal and genetic model system, Drosophila was selected as the best tool for studying the function and dynamics of PARP1 protein interaction with chromatin in vivo. Unlike mammals, which have multiple PARP-related proteins, only a single nuclear PARP1 gene (15Adams M.D. Kim S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li P.W. Hoskins R.A.

Therefore, in this paper we study Drosophila PARP1 to first identify the components of nucleosomal core particles, which are responsible for PARP1 protein binding and activation, and then, based on these findings, deconstruct and analyze the machinery responsible for PARP1-chromatin interaction. Drosophila Strains and Genetics—Genetic markers are described in FlyBase 1999, and stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center, except as indicated. pP{w1, UAST::PARP1-DsRed}, called UAS::Parp1-DsRed, was described in Ref. 17Tulin A. Kim D. Spradling A.C. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2108-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar. The transgenic stock with pP{w1, UAST:: PARG-EGFP}, called UAS::Parg-EGFP, was described in Ref. 18Tulin A. Kim N.M. Menon A.K. Spradling A.C. Genetics. 2006; 172: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. The following GAL4 driver strains were used: 69B-GAL4 (19Manseau L. Kim A. Brower D. Budhu A. Elefant F. Phan H. Philp A.V. Yang M. Glover D. Kaiser K. Palter K. Selleck S. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 310-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and arm::GAL4 (Bloomington stock no. 1560). Balancer chromosome carrying Kr::GFP, i.e. TM3, P{w1, Kr-GFP} (20Casso D. Kim F. Kornberg T.B. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), was used to identify heterozygous and homozygous ParpCH1 (17Tulin A. Kim D. Spradling A.C. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2108-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Construction of Transgenic Drosophila—To construct UAS::H2A-ECFP and UAS::H1-EYFP, we generated full-length histone H2A and histone H1 open reading frame using PCR. Primers used were as follows: for H1 cloning, h1d, CACCatgtctgattctgcagttg, and h1r, ctttttggcagccgtag; and for H2A cloning, h2ad, CACCatgtctggacgtggaaaagg, and h2ar, ggccttcttctcggtcttcttg. We used wild-type Drosophila genomic DNA as a template for PCR. The resulting PCR products were cloned through The Drosophila Gateway™ vector cloning system (Carnegie Institution of Washington) into the corresponding vector for Drosophila transformation. Transformation was performed as described in Ref. 21Spradling A.C. Kim G.M. Science. 1982; 218: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, with modifications (22Prokhorova A.V.

Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) Assay—FRAP experiments on live Drosophila tissues were performed as described in Ref. 23Phair R.D. Kim T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar. To conduct these experiments, we used a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope with capacity for FRAP. To avoid the oxidative stress and other damage that lasers can cause, we used only the minimal level of laser power. This step extended the “bleaching” phase but did not affect our results. To collect FRAP data, we employed the “FlyMode” program, which allows data collection even during the bleaching phase. The recordings were performed via a 63× 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. We found that all the fluorescent epitopes we tested (ECFP, EYFP (Venus), EGFP, and DsRed) were appropriate for FRAP assays, as well as for regular confocal analysis. We did not detect epitope-specific biases in the function, expression dynamics, or localization of any fused moiety. We used transgenic fly stocks that express appropriate fluorescent epitope-tagged protein. Tissues were dissected in Grace’s medium, and dynamic movement of fluorescent proteins was analyzed for 20-30 min following dissection. Nuclei Isolation and Micrococcal Nuclease Digestion—0.5 g of fresh pupae were homogenized in 10 ml of buffer A1 (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgClB2B, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and CompletePTMP protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)), using a Potter homogenizer (Pyrex). The homogenate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem), homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer (Pestle B) (Kontes Glass Co.) with 10-15 strokes, and centrifuged for 4 min at 4000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once with 10 ml of the A1 buffer, then resuspended in 6 ml of A1, loaded onto 3 ml of buffer A1/0.3 m sucrose, and centrifuged for 6 min at 1500 × g at 4 °C. The nuclei were washed once with 3 ml of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaClB2B, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.5 mm DTT, and EDTA-free CompletePTMP protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)), diluted by MNase digestion buffer to 1 ml, and incubated with ∼200 units of MNase (Worthington) at 37 °C for 3 min, 650 rpm in Thermomixer (Eppendorf). An amount of MNase sufficient for complete chromatin digestion to mononucleosomes was chosen in preliminary experiments for each aliquot of the enzyme. The reaction was stopped by 25 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. After the addition of 200 μl of M buffer (190 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 440 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgClB2B, 125 mm NaF, 5 mm NaB3BVOB4B, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm DTT, and 2× CompletePTMP protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)), the nuclei were lysed on a rotating platform at 4 °C for 20 min. The nuclei extract was clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 17,000 × g at 4 °C. Sucrose Gradient—300 μl of nuclear extract were loaded onto 12 ml of 10-30% linear sucrose gradient in buffer B (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and CompletePTMP protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) and poured into UltraClear ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman, no. 344059), using Hoefer SG15 gradient maker (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) and Pharmacia Biotech Pump P1. The probes were centrifuged using Sw41Ti rotor (Beckman) (35,000 rpm, 20 h, 4 °C). 1-ml fractions were collected manually through the hole made in the bottom of a tube. Analysis of Gradient Fractions—Proteins were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated from 700 μl of 1-ml gradient fraction, dissolved in 200 μl of 2× Laemmli, and analyzed by Western blot (30 μl for one assay) on 4-12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE Gel (Invitrogen). The primary antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal antibody H1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8030) (1:500), monoclonal antibody H3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., no. 05-499) (1:1000), rabbit polyclonal antibody H2A#618 (1:3000) from Dr. R. Glaser (Division of Genetic Disorders, Wadsworth Center, Albany, NY), polyclonal antibody PAR (Calbiochem) (1:4000), and polyclonal antibody GFP (1:1000-1:1500) (TP401, Torrey Pines Biolabs). The remaining 300 μl of each fraction was digested with 100 μg/ml proteinase K in 1% SDS at 50 °C for 2 h, 650 rpm in Thermomixer (Eppendorff). DNA was then recovered by phenol chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation with glycogen as a carrier. Pellet was dissolved in 40 μl of HB2BO, incubated with 2 μg of RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C, and analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel. Immunoprecipitation—For one immunoprecipitation reaction, 300 μl of nuclear extract was incubated with 60 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4B (Sigma P3296-5ML) on a rotating platform for 1 h at 4 °C.The beads were removed by spinning for 5 min at 15,000 × g.25 μg of anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Torrey Pines, TP401) were added to the extract and incubated for 2 h or overnight on a rotating platform at 4 °C. Then 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4B were added to the extract and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed five times for 3 min in 1.2 ml of the buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgClB2B,BB25 mm NaF, 1 mm NaB3BVOB4B, 1 mm EDTA, and CompletePTMP protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). Bound proteins were eluted by 100 μl of 2× Laemmli with heating at 90 °C for 5 min. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Mass spectrometric identification of proteins was carried out as described in Ref. 24Bouwmeester T. Kim A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G. Croughton K. Cruciat C. Eberhard D. Gagneur J. Ghidelli S. Hopf C. Huhse B. Mangano R. Michon A.M. Schirle M. Schlegl J. Schwab M. Stein M.A. Bauer A. Casari G. Drewes G. Gavin A.C. Jackson D.B. Joberty G. Neubauer G.

Complete lanes from protein gels were cut into slices (narrow for specific bands) and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem MS. The tandem MS data were analyzed using the SEQUESTP Pprogram. Protein complexes from four purifications were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem MS, and a total of 22 proteins were identified. It should be emphasized that it is essential to perform several purifications for a given bait protein to obtain a reliable view of its interaction network, because significant interactors are expected to be reproducibly identified in more than one experiment. In Vitro Interaction Assays—Histones and histone octamers were isolated or assembled according to Ref. 25Luger K. Kim T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar. Protein coupling to CnBr-activated Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and in vitro binding assays were adapted from (26Cirillo L.A. Kim F.R. Cuesta I. Friedman D. Jarnik M. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Briefly, beads coupled to histone octamer (20 pmol), PARP1 (30 pmol, Trevigen), or individual histones (400 pmol) were washed once for 10 min in binding/washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Washed beads were incubated with octamer (22.12 pmol), PARP1 (8 pmol), or rabbit IgG (8 pmol, Sigma) in binding/washing buffer for 20 min. The beads were then washed five times for 10 min in binding/washing buffer. All of the binding/washing was done at room temperature with gentle rotation. Full-length PARP1 and rabbit IgG were visualized on Western blots with anti-PARP1 (mouse monoclonal, 1:500, Serotec) and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:3000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs), respectively. Anti-PARP1 C terminus (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000) and anti-PARP1 N terminus (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000) were gifts from Dr. Lee Kraus (Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). PARP1 Activity Assay—0.2 nmol of histones and/or 2.5 μg of endonuclease-digested plasmid DNA were combined with 5× PARP1 reaction buffer (0.05 unit/μl PARP1 enzyme (Trevigen), 500 μm NAD (Sigma), 500 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT) in a final volume of 25 μl. PARP1 inhibition was achieved by the addition of 3-aminobenzamine (Sigma) to a final concentration of 12 mm. All of the reactions were carried out for 10 min at room temperature. PARP1 Protein Association with Chromatin Is Dynamic—To study PARP1 interaction with chromatin, we first analyzed the dynamic localization of this protein in vivo by using a FRAP assay. To visualize the PARP1 protein in Drosophila, we used the UAS/Gal4 system (27Brand A.H. Kim N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for transgenic expression of PARP1-DsRed (encoding full-length, catalytically active PARP1) and for a contrasting control, PARPe-EGFP (encoding a naturally occurring, catalytically inactive form of PARP1) (Fig. 1A). Previously, we biologically validated those constructs by testing their ability to rescue a ParpCH1 mutation phenotype and by using immunofluorescence to assess recombinant protein localization to chromatin (2Tulin A. Kim A. Science. 2003; 299: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 17Tulin A. Kim D. Spradling A.C. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2108-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). As references, we also made transgenic flies with core histone H2A-ECFP and linker histone H1-EYFP (Fig. 1A), which served as comparative controls defining the protein mobility of chromatin-associated proteins. As an additional reference for the mobility of a nucleoplasmic soluble protein, we made transgenic flies expressing PARG-EGFP (18Tulin A. Kim N.M. Menon A.K. Spradling A.C. Genetics. 2006; 172: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To express our transgenic constructs in Drosophila, we used the 69B-GAL4 driver (19Manseau L. Kim A. Brower D. Budhu A. Elefant F. Phan H. Philp A.V. Yang M. Glover D. Kaiser K. Palter K. Selleck S. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 310-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which allows expression of recombinant protein ubiquitously without excess overproduction (supplemental Fig. S1). All of the recombinant proteins demonstrated exclusive nuclear localization in all tissues of the fruit fly (supplemental Fig. S1). All of the recombinant proteins except PARG-EGFP were also associated with chromatin. Previously, we reported that PARG is a soluble nucleoplasmic protein (18Tulin A. Kim N.M. Menon A.K. Spradling A.C. Genetics. 2006; 172: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). H1-YFP and H2A-CFP histones remain bound to chromatin during all stages of cell cycle, whereas PARPe-EGFP and PARP1-DsRed are partially excluded from mitotic chromosomes (supplemental Fig. S2). To explore whether the catalytic activity of PARP1 influences the dynamics of PARP1 protein interaction with chromatin, we compared the FRAP dynamics of PARPe-EGFP protein with those of full-length, enzymatically active PARP1-DsRed in Drosophila interphase nuclei. We co-expressed both recombinant PARPs in the ParpCH1 mutant animals (17Tulin A. Kim D. Spradling A.C. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2108-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) using Arm::Gal4 driver. The catalytically active PARP1-DsRed and inactive PARPe-EGFP demonstrated exactly the same localization profiles (Fig. 1B) and the same replacement rate (Fig. 1C and Table 1). This suggested that the catalytic domain of PARP1 is not involved in PARP1 protein interaction with chromatin. Based on this last result, we then used the PARPe-EGFP isoform to remove the potential for artifacts arising from the expression of catalytically active PARP1-DsRed, e.g. hyper-activation of the pADPr reaction targeting nonphysiological substrates. In the early stages of Drosophila development, catalytically inactive PARPe protein is expressed endogenously, and overexpression of it does not affect Drosophila development (17Tulin A. Kim D. Spradling A.C. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2108-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Quantification of the fluorescence recovery after photobleachingRecombinant proteinT½PARP1-DsRed104 ± 6 sPARPe-EGFP101 ± 4 sPARG-EGFP3 ± 2 sH1-EYFP108 ± 4 sH2A-ECFP>20 min Open table in a new tab We then compared the PARPe-EGFP protein dynamics after photobleaching to those of histone H2A-ECFP, linker histone H1-EYFP, and the soluble nucleoplasmic protein PARG-EGFP (Fig. 1D and Table 1). As anticipated, the soluble PARG-EGFP demonstrated the highest recovery rate: 78% within 5 s. In contrast, the replacement rate for the control core histone H2A in chromatin was close to zero (Fig. 1D), whereas linker histone H1 showed a ∼49% replacement rate after 100 s of recovery (Fig. 1D), which is similar to previously reported values (28Misteli T. Kim A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). These data indicated that the PARP1 protein recovery kinetics was similar to that of H1 histone. A small, but reproducible difference is only observed during the first “fast” phase of recovery (Fig. 1D). During this phase the PARP1 protein recovery is more rapid, which suggested that the pool of soluble nucleoplasmic PARP1 is higher than the pool of soluble H1 protein. The deviation in the binding kinetics may also reflect differences in mechanisms of PARP1 protein and histone H1 interaction with nucleosomal arrays. PARP Proteins Are Continuously Exchanged between Chromatin Domains—We characterized the dynamics of PARPe-EGFP in different nuclear subcompartments: euchromatic, heterochromatic, and nucleolar. We defined heterochromatin on the basis of morphological criteria as a condensed block of chromatin attached to the nuclear lamina and associated with the nucleolus. In contrast to euchromatin, heterochromatin demonstrated a very low level of PARPe-EGFP fluorescence recovery (Fig. 1E), which might be attributed to low accessibility of compacted heterochromatin. Although the nucleolus is decondensed and accumulates PARPe-EGFP protein, PARPe-EGFP protein recovery to photobleached nucleoli is also minimal. This implies that the mechanism of PARPe-EGFP protein association with nucleolar chromatin may be different from that in other nuclear compartments. Next, we analyzed PARPe-EGFP protein dynamics in respect to chromatin subdomains, as noted above. We photobleached regions of euchromatin in a giant polyploid cell of Drosophila salivary gland expressing PARPe-EGFP and then recorded the recovery of fluorescence signal in the bleached area by time lapse imaging (Fig. 2A). PARPe-EGFP protein recovery had two distinct phases: 1) a fast phase, in which ∼50% of the fluorescent signal was recovered within 100 s after bleaching (Fig. 2A, graph) and 2) a “slow” phase, in which the signal was recovered up to ∼97% of starting levels during 15-20 min (not shown). These results suggested that, in the nucleus, most of the PARPe-EGFP molecules are bound to chromatin at any given time. Following this hypothesis, the pool of free soluble PARPe-EGFP is rapidly depleted for fast recovery, whereas the slow phase recruits PARPe-EGFP, which has dissociated from other chromatin domains. This hypothesis suggests that there is equilibrium of PARPe-EGFP protein association with different domains of chromatin and depletion of PARPe-EGFP protein from one locus leads to redistribution of PARPe-EGFP in the whole nucleus. To test this idea and better evaluate the kinetics of PARPe-EGFP protein exchange between chromatin subdomains, we bleached an extended rectangular area occupying approximately one-third of the total area of the nucleus (Fig. 2B). We compared the fluorescent signal within four distinct euchromatin subdomains, two (RO1 and RO4) localized outside of the bleached area and two bleached subdomains (RO2 and RO3). The recovery kinetics for the two bleached subdomains was similar to that observed in previous experiments. However, unbleached chromatin subdomains lost PARPe-EGFP fluorescence, whereas fluorescent intensity came to equilibrium in all four areas after ∼150 s (Fig. 2B). This observation directly demonstrated that PARPe-EGFP is continuously exchanged between chromatin regions in the nucleus. Based on the rapid exchange rate, our findings further indicate that the PARPe-EGFP protein is dynamic in its association with chromatin. However, the profile of PARPe-EGFP protein distribution among chromatin subdomains was very stable and reconstituted after recovery from bleaching (Fig. 2B). Thus, there must be high affinity landmarks for PARPe-EGFP binding on chromatin that maintains the stability of local PARPe-EGFP concentration in any given domain of chromatin. To identify these landmarks, we performed purification of PARPe-EGFP-containing protein complexes and identification of PARPe-EGFP protein partners using MS analysis. PARPe-EGFP Protein Co-purifies with Nucleosomal Core Histones—To identify PARPe-EGFP-chromatin targeting proteins, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments from a Drosophila stock with ubiquitous expression of the PARPe-EGFP transgenic construct. We purified protein complexes from nuclear extracts prepared from Drosophila pupae. Pupal extracts treated with micrococcal nuclease to produce mononucleosomes were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies to collect PARPe-EGFP-associated complexes. As a control, extracts from wild-type flies were immunoprecipitated in parallel reactions to allow identification of proteins specifically interacting with PARPe-EGFP. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by MS analysis. Based on this analysis, we identified 22 nuclear proteins that specifically interacted with the PARPe-EGFP protein (Table 2). Among these, only the nucleosomal core histones H4, H3, H2A, and H2B (Fig. 3A) were ubiquitous chromatin components. We did not identify H1 histone among the PARPe-EGFP-interacting proteins in multiple experiments, even though the interaction of PARP1 protein with linker histone H1 has been shown in vitro (29Kun E. Kim E. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39066-39069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The last result correlates with the observation that H1 and PARP1 are antagonists in the chromatin in vivo (3Kim M.Y. Kim S. Gevry N. Lis J. T. Kraus W. L. Cell. 2004; 119: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The interactions of the PARP1 protein with core histones were confirmed in experiments with immunoprecipitation of protein complexes with PARP1-DsRed protein as bait (not shown). Based on these results, together with our earlier data demonstrating the broad distribution of the PARP1 protein in chromatin, we hypothesized that the PARP1 protein interacts either directly or indirectly with nucleosomal particles.TABLE 2Proteins associated with the PARPe-EGFP protein in DrosophilaProtein nameClass of proteinNominal molecular weightMASCOT scoreMASCOT expectSequence coverage%P17763Retroviral genome polyprotein138,031700.004618Fbp1Fat body protein 1119,591730.001423PA"

The absence of flagella in the AIEC strain LF82 results in a concomitant loss of type 1 pili. Here, we show that flagellar regulators, transcriptional activator FlhD2C2, and sigma factor FliA are involved in the coordination of flagellar and type 1 pili synthesis. In the deletion mutants lacking these regulators, type 1 pili synthesis, adhesion, and invasion were severely decreased. FliA expressed alone in trans was sufficient to restore these defects in both the LF82-ΔflhD and LF82-ΔfliA mutants. We related the loss of type 1 pili to the decreased expression of the FliA-dependent yhjH gene in the LF82-ΔfliA mutant. YhjH is an EAL domain phosphodiesterase involved in degradation of the bacterial second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). Increased expression of either yhjH or an alternative c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, yahA, partially restored type 1 pili synthesis, adhesion, and invasion in the LF82-ΔfliA mutant. Deletion of the GGDEF domain diguanylate cyclase gene, yaiC, involved in c-di-GMP synthesis in the LF82-ΔfliA mutant also partially restored these defects, whereas overexpression of the c-di-GMP receptor YcgR had the opposite effect. These findings show that in the AIEC strain LF82, FliA is a key regulatory component linking flagellar and type 1 pili synthesis and that its effect on type 1 pili is mediated, at least in part, via a c-di-GMP-dependent pathway.

In Enterobacteriaceae, flagellar type III secretion and assembly are strictly dependent on the organization of a hierarchy that controls the sequential expression of structural and regulatory genes. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, the heterotetrameric transcription factor FlhD2C2 (8Liu X. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7345-7351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is positioned at the top of the flagellar expression hierarchy, where the decision to produce flagella is made (9McCarter L.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Chilcott G.S. Hughes K.T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 694-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The flhDC operon encoding FlhD2C2 is transcribed from a class 1 flagellar promoter. FlhD2C2, in turn, activates σ70-dependent transcription from the class 2 flagellar promoters that drive expression of the structural subunits required for the hook-basal body structure and expression of regulatory subunits (10Chilcott G.S. Hughes K.T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 694-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 11Macnab R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 131-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). One of these regulatory subunits, σ28 or FliA, is encoded by the fliAZ operon. FliA can associate with the core RNA polymerase to drive transcription of the class 3 flagellar genes (12Arnosti D.N. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 830-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The activity of FliA depends on its interaction with the cytoplasmic anti-sigma factor FlgM, which inhibits the FliA-RNA polymerase association until completion of the hook-basal body assembly, at which point the anti-sigma factor is secreted (13Chadsey M.S. Karlinsey J.E. Hughes K.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3123-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that additional negative feedback loops exist to ensure that every stage of flagellar assembly is signaled prior to synthesis of the components for the next stage. This feedback control allows cells to avoid costly production of unnecessary flagellar subunits (14Aldridge P. Hughes K.T. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Global transcriptional profiling in E. coli (15Pruss B.M. Campbell J.W. Van Dyk T.K. Zhu C. Kogan Y. Matsumura P. J.

These flagellar regulators have been shown to affect the synthesis of virulence factors, directly and indirectly, such as secreted hemolysin in Proteus mirabilis (19Fraser G.M. Claret L. Furness R.

Together, these findings indicate that coordinated regulation of motility and virulence factor synthesis is not limited to Enterobacteriaceae. Our study concerns a new pathogenic group of E. coli associated with ileal lesions of Crohn disease (29Boudeau J. Glasser A.L. Masseret E. Joly B. Darfeuille-Michaud A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4499-4509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Darfeuille-Michaud A. Boudeau J. Bulois P. Neut C. Glasser A.L. Barnich N. Bringer M.A. Swidsinski A. Beaugerie L. Colombel J.F. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 412-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). The strains belonging to this pathovar, designated adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), are able to adhere to and to invade intestinal epithelial cells and replicate within macrophages (29Boudeau J. Glasser A.L. Masseret E. Joly B. Darfeuille-Michaud A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4499-4509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AIEC adhesion to and invasion depend on the type 1 pili that are involved in triggering membrane extensions in epithelial cells (31Boudeau J. Barnich N. Darfeuille-Michaud A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1272-1284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the type 1 pili of AIEC reference strain LF82 are not able to confer invasiveness to a nonpathogenic E. coli strain K-12, which proves that the genetic background of AIEC is essential. Flagella play important roles in the adhesion to and invasion of strain LF82 (32Barnich N. Boudeau J. Claret L. Darfeuille-Michaud A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 781-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The nonmotile aflagellar LF82-ΔfliC mutant shows a drastic down-regulation of type 1 pili synthesis, a decrease in adhesion and invasion abilities, and a feedback-induced decrease in the flagellar regulator flhDC mRNA levels. This demonstrates that, in strain LF82, as in other bacteria mentioned above, flagellar motility and other factors are coregulated. In this report, we gained insights into the coregulation of flagella, type 1 pili synthesis, adhesion, and invasion in strain LF82. We disrupted the flhD and fliA genes to test whether FlhD2C2 and FliA are involved in the direct or indirect transcriptional regulation of genes encoding type 1 pili. We further show that FliA affects phase variation, which results in increased type 1 synthesis via a regulatory pathway involving a novel second messenger, cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). 2The abbreviation used is: c-di-GMP, cyclic dimeric GMP. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Cell Lines—Strain AIEC LF82 was isolated from a chronic ileal lesion of a patient with Crohn disease and belongs to E. coli serotype O83:H1. It adheres to and invades HEp-2, Intestine-407, and Caco-2 cells (29Boudeau J. Glasser A.L. Masseret E. Joly B. Darfeuille-Michaud A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4499-4509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strain JM109 was used as host strain for cloning experiments.

Bacteria were grown routinely in LB broth or on LB agar plates overnight at 37 °C. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin (50 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml). Intestine-407 cells (derived from human intestinal embryonic jejunum and ileum) were purchased from Flow Laboratories, Inc. (McLean, VA). Cultured cells were maintained in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C in modified Eagleŉs medium (Seromed, Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Seromed), 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1% l-glutamine (Invitrogen); 200 units of penicillin, 50 mg of streptomycin, and 0.25 mg of amphoterocin B per liter; and 1% minimal essential medium vitamin mix X-100 (Invitrogen). Adhesion and Invasion Assays—The bacterial invasion was performed using the gentamicin protection assay. Briefly, monolayers were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates (Polylabo, Strasbourg, France) with 4 × 105 cells/well and incubated for 20 h. Monolayers were then infected in 1 ml of the cell culture medium without antibiotics and with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at a multiplicity of infection of 10 bacteria per epithelial cell. The infected monolayers were centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g before the 3-h infection period at 37 °C and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2). The epithelial cells were then lysed with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in deionized water. Samples were diluted and plated onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates to determine the number of colony-forming units corresponding to the total number of cell-associated bacteria (adherent and intracellular bacteria). To determine the number of intracellular bacteria, fresh cell culture medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma) was added for 1 h to eliminate extracellular bacteria. Monolayers were then lysed with 1% Triton X-100. The bacteria were quantified as described above. Immunoblotting—Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth without agitation. 700 μl of culture were centrifuged, and the pellet of bacteria was suspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Western immunoblotting was performed according to the procedure of Towbin et al. (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The total protein extracts were heated for 5 min with 0.23% HCl, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween (TBST) at room temperature for 2 h. The membranes were reacted with the rabbit antiserum raised against purified type 1 pili preparations, a generous gift from Karen Krogfelt, diluted in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBST at room temperature for 2 h. Immunoreactants were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (1:10,000), enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography. Yeast Cell Aggregation Assay—Commercial bakerŉs yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mg, dry weight/ml). E. coli strains were resuspended to an optical density of 0.6 at 620 nm in phosphate-buffered saline. Equal volumes of fixed yeast cell suspension and decreasing concentrations of E. coli suspension were mixed in a 96-well plate. Aggregation was monitored visually, and the titer was recorded as the last dilution of bacteria giving a positive aggregation reaction. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Bacteria were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani broth without shaking and were fixed and negatively stained with 1% ammonium molybdate on carbon-Formvar copper grids. Gold immunolabeling was performed by the method of Levine et al. (34Levine M.M. Ristaino P. Marley G. Smyth C. Knutton S. Boedeker E. Black R. Young C. Clements M.L. Cheney C. Patnaik R. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 409-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A washed bacterial suspension was placed on carbon-Formvar copper grids. Excess liquid was removed, and the grids were placed face down on antiserum (1:1000) raised against purified type 1 pili for 15 min. After 10 washings, the grids were placed on a drop of gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit serum (Jansen Life Sciences Products, Olen, Belgium) for 15 min. After a further thorough washing, the grids were negatively stained with 1% ammonium molybdate for 1 min. DNA Manipulations, Hybridization, and PCR Experiments—PCR conditions and all PCR primer sequences are listed in Table S1. DNA to be amplified was released from whole organisms by boiling. Bacteria were harvested from 1.5 ml of an overnight broth culture, suspended in 150 μl of sterile water, and incubated at 100 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation of the lysate, 5 μl of the supernatant were used in the PCR assays. Construction of Isogenic Mutants—Isogenic mutants were generated using PCR products, as described by Datsenko et al (35Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar) and modified by Chaveroche et al. (36Chaveroche M.K. Ghigo J.M. d'Enfert C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E97Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The basic strategy was to replace a chromosomal sequence with a selectable antibiotic resistance gene (kanamycin or chloramphenicol) generated by PCR. This PCR product was generated by using primers with 50-nucleotide extensions that are homologous to regions adjacent to the target gene and template E. coli strain harboring the kanamycin resistance gene on the pKD4 plasmid. For the construction of flhD and fliA mutants in AIEC strain LF82, the chloramphenicol resistance cassette was amplified from E. coli K12 mutants carrying deletions. In addition, strain AIEC LF82 was transformed with pKOBEG or pKD46 plasmid, a plasmid that encoded Red proteins from phage λ, synthesized under the control of an l-arabinose-inducible promoter. This plasmid was maintained in bacteria at 30 °C with 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol and was eliminated at 37 °C. Strain LF82/pKOBEG or pKD46 was grown at 30 °C with 1 mm l-arabinose to induce Red expression. When A620 nm reached 0.6, the bacterial culture was incubated for 20 min at 42 °C to eliminate the plasmid. Bacteria were washed three times with 10% glycerol, and PCR products were electroporated. Isogenic mutants were selected on LB agar containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin or 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Replacement of the gene by the kanamycin or chloramphenicol resistance cassette in isogenic mutant was confirmed by PCR. Transcomplementation Assays—The genes were amplified by PCR (PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermal cycler) from AIEC LF82 genomic DNA (1–10 ng) using 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and appropriate primers in Pfu DNA polymerase buffer containing a 200 μm concentration of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate. The amplified DNAs were purified using a NucleoSpin extract kit (Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany), digested with HindIII and XbaI or EcoRI, and ligated in cloning vector pBAD18. RNA Manipulations and Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from bacteria and treated with DNase I (Roche Applied Science). The mRNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using gene-specific primers (Table S1 of supplemental materials). Real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed using a Light Cycler (Roche Applied Science), and quantification of the mRNA level or 16 S rRNA (as a control) was performed using RNA master SYBER Green 1 (Roche Applied Science) with 0.5 μg of total RNA. Amplification of a single expected reverse transcription-PCR product was confirmed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. Calcofluor Binding Assays—5 μl of an overnight culture suspended in water (A600 of 5) were spotted onto LB agar plates without NaCl supplemented with calcofluor (fluorescence brightener 28; 50 μg/ml). Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The dye binding was analyzed over time. Statistical Analysis—For analysis of the significance of differences in adhesion and invasion levels, Studentŉs t test was used for comparison of two groups of data. All experiments were performed at least three times. A p value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. FlhD2C2 and FliA Play Key Roles in Interactions of AIEC Strain LF82 with Intestinal Epithelial Cells—To analyze the role of major flagella regulators FlhD2C2 and FliA in the adhesion and invasion abilities of the AIEC strain LF82, we constructed mutants with deletions in the flhD or fliA genes. As expected, the LF82-ΔflhD and LF82-ΔfliA mutants were nonmotile (data not shown). We measured the adhesion and invasion levels of these flagellar mutants using an in vitro assay with Intestine-407 epithelial cells. Since the LF82-ΔflhD and LF82-ΔfliA mutants were nonmotile, we included a centrifugation step to bring bacterial and epithelial cells into close contact and thereby to enable bacteria to initiate infection. Both mutants were strongly impaired in adhesion and invasion compared with the wild-type strain LF82. The adhesion and invasion levels of the LF82-ΔflhD mutant were significantly lower (19 and 30%, respectively) than of those of strain LF82. Similarly, the adhesion and invasion levels of LF82-ΔfliA were significantly lower (13 and 20%, respectively) than those of strain LF82 (Fig. 1, A and B). These results are consistent with our earlier observation that the LF82-ΔfliC mutant, which lacks flagellin, is impaired in adhesion and invasion abilities. They further indicate that, in strain LF82, the FlhD2C2 and FliA regulators are instrumental in enabling bacteria to enter intestinal epithelial cells, irrespective of flagellar motility. Decreased Adhesion and Invasion of the ΔflhD and ΔfliA Mutants Is a Consequence of Lowered Levels of Type 1 Pili—The decrease in the ability to adhere to and to invade epithelial cells has been observed in nonflagellated mutants of strain LF82 and was attributed to lower type 1 pili levels (32Barnich N. Boudeau J. Claret L. Darfeuille-Michaud A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 781-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 37Barnich N. Bringer M.A. Claret L. Darfeuille-Michaud A. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2484-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed expression of type 1 pili in the LF82-ΔflhD and LF82-ΔfliA mutants by monitoring bacterial aggregation of yeast cells, which occurs as a result of pili binding to d-mannose residues located at the yeast surface. Both mutants were strongly impaired in their ability to aggregate yeast cells compared with the wild type strain. We verified that this was a consequence of a decreased level of the FimA major subunit of type 1 pili by Western blot using a type 1 pili antiserum (Fig. 1C). The regulation of type 1 pili expression is controlled by phase variation, which allows bacteria to switch between piliated and nonpiliated states by inverting a fimS DNA element located upstream of the fim operon. We used a PCR-based approach (38Schwan W.R. Seifert H.S. Duncan J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to confirm that the deficiency in type 1 pili resulted from the shift of the DNA invertible element orientation toward the phase-OFF orientation (Fig. 1C). To confirm the critical role of type 1 pili in the impaired adhesion and invasion of the LF82-ΔflhD and LF82-ΔfliA mutants, we transformed both mutants with plasmid pORN104, which contains the fim operon in vector pRN2010. The transformants expressed type 1 pili to levels close to those of strain LF82/pORN104, as shown by comparable reaction with the type 1 pili antiserum (Fig. 2A). Transmission electron microscope examination of gold immunolabeling of the LF82-ΔfliA/pORN104 and the LF82-ΔflhD/pORN104 transformants using anti-type 1 pili antibodies revealed that type 1 pili were properly assembled at the surface of bacteria even in the absence of flagella (Fig. 2B). The induced synthesis of type 1 pili partially restored adhesion and invasion levels to 57 and 44%, respectively, in LF82-ΔflhD and to 61 and 41%, respectively, in LF82-ΔfliA, compared with levels in LF82/pORN104 (Fig. 2, C and D). The incomplete restoration of adherence and invasiveness suggests that type 1 pili may not be the only adhesion/invasion determinant regulated by FlhD2C2 and FliA. FliA Restores Adhesion/Invasion Defects in both ΔfliA and ΔflhD Mutants—In the flagellar gene hierarchy, expression levels of FlhD2C2 intimately depend on the presence of FliA and vice versa (9McCarter L.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Chilcott G.S. Hughes K.T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 694-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). To further clarify the involvement of FlhD2C2 and FliA in the control of adhesion and invasion in strain LF82, the LF82-ΔflhD and LF82-ΔfliA mutants were transformed with plasmids pBADflhDC and pBADfliA expressing FlhD2C2 and FliA, respectively. We ensured that adhesion, invasion, and motility of LF82-ΔflhD and LF82-ΔfliA were fully complemented with pBADflhDC and pBADfliA, respectively (Table 2; data not shown). The overexpressed flhDC operon had no effect on adhesion and invasion in the LF82-ΔfliA mutant. However, the overexpressed fliA gene fully restored the defects in the LF82-ΔflhD mutant (Table 2). These results indicate that, in addition to type 1 pili synthesis, the full invasiveness of AIEC strain LF82 is likely to be controlled through the FliA-dependent gene expression.TABLE 2Regulation of type 1 pili and adhesion and invasion abilities of AIEC strain LF82 compared with LF82-ΔflhD and LF82-ΔfliA mutantsStrainYeast aggregationaAggregation was monitored visually, and the titer was recorded as the last dilution giving a positive aggregation reaction.AdhesionbSee Fig. 1 legend.InvasionbSee Fig. 1 legend.%%LF821/96100100LF82-ΔflhD1/1621 ± 334 ± 6LF82-ΔflhD/pBADflhDC1/9695 ± 495"
https://openalex.org/W1983697370,"Gamma-secretase, a unique aspartyl protease, is required for the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Notch and APP, pathways that are implicated, respectively, in the pathogenesis of cancer and Alzheimer disease. However, the mechanism whereby reduction of gamma-secretase causes tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that gamma-secretase functions in epithelia as a tumor suppressor in an enzyme activity-dependent manner. Notch signaling is down-regulated and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is activated in SCC caused by genetic reduction of gamma-secretase. Moreover, the level of EGFR is inversely correlated with the level of gamma-secretase in fibroblasts, suggesting that the up-regulation of EGFR stimulates hyperproliferation in epithelia of mice with genetic reduction of gamma-secretase. Supporting this notion is our finding that the proliferative response of fibroblasts lacking gamma-secretase activity is more sensitive when challenged by either EGF or an inhibitor of EGFR as ompared with wild type cells. Interestingly, the up-regulation of EGFR is independent of Notch signaling, suggesting that the EGFR pathway functions in parallel with Notch in the tumorigenesis of SCC. Collectively, our results establish a novel mechanism linking the EGFR pathway to the tumor suppressor role of gamma-secretase and that mice with genetic reduction of gamma-secretase represent an excellent rodent model for clarifying pathogenesis of SCC and for testing therapeutic strategy to ameliorate this type of human cancer."

Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 are the two most widely expressed L-type Ca2+ channels in neurons and have different biophysical and subcellular distributions. The function of the Cav 1.3 L-type Ca2+ channel and its cellular mechanisms in the central nervous system are poorly understood. In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that the N terminus of the rat Cav1.3 α1 subunit interacts with a partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2). Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot assays revealed high expression of both Cav1.3 and RyR2 in the rat hippocampus. We also demonstrate a physical association of Cav1.3 with RyR2 using co-immunoprecipitation assays. Moreover, immunocytochemistry revealed prominent co-localization between Cav1.3 and RyR2 in hippocampal neurons. Depolarizing cells by an acute treatment of a high concentration of KCl (high-K, 60 mm) showed that the activation of L-type Ca2+ channels induced RyR opening and led to RyR-dependent Ca2+ release, even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Furthermore, we found that RyR2 mRNA itself is increased by long term treatment of high-K via activation of L-type Ca2+ channels. These acute and long term effects of high-K on RyRs were selectively blocked by small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of Cav1.3. These results suggest a physical and functional interaction between Cav1.3 and RyR2 and important implications of Cav1.3/RyR2 clusters in translating synaptic activity into alterations in gene expression.

Intracellular Ca2+ plays an important role in Ca2+-regulated neuronal functions, including membrane excitability, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic plasticity (1Clapham D.E.

It is not only controlled by influx of Ca2+ into the cell through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) 2The abbreviations used are: VDCC, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel; CNS, central nervous system; RyR2, ryanodine receptor type 2; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RyR, ryanodine receptor; Cav1.3-NT, N terminus of Cav1.3 α1 subunit; RyR2-NT, a partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of RyR2; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+ concentration; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphophate; Bay K, Bay K-8644; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DIV, days in vitro; high-K, high concentration of KCl; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; RT, reverse transcription. but also by the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. VDCCs can be distinguished by their electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics as follows: high voltage-activated channels that are further divided into L-, N-, P/Q-, and R-type Ca2+ channels and low voltage-activated (T-type) Ca2+ channels (3Hess P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1990; 13: 337-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 4Tsien R.W. Ellinor P.T. Horne W.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 349-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Among the high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, physiological functions of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels in the central nervous system (CNS) have been extensively studied because of their central role in controlling Ca2+ entry into, and thus neurotransmitter release from, neuronal synaptic terminals (5Dunlap K. Luebke J.I. Turner T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 6Catterall W.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 144-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Neuronal L-type Ca2+ channels have also been studied particularly because of their importance in translating synaptic activity into alterations in gene expression and neuronal function (7Beam K.G. Tanabe T. Numa S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 560: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Smith P.A. Ammala C. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Cell.

BioEssays. 1997; 19: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Until recently, four genes, which encode L-type Ca2+ channel pore-forming subunits, had been identified. These were designated Cav1.1 (α1S), Cav1.2 (α1C), Cav1.3 (α1D), and- Cav1.4 (α1F) (11Lipscombe D. Pan J.Q. Gray A.C. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 26: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lipscombe D. Helton T.D. Xu W. J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 2633-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Among them, Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 are the two most widely expressed L-type Ca2+ channel subunits in neurons and have different biophysical properties and subcellular distributions (12Lipscombe D. Helton T.D. Xu W. J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 2633-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 13Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E. Warner C. Ahlijanian M.K. Prystay W. Gilbert M.M. Snutch T.P.

However, most studies of L-type Ca2+ channels are confined to Cav1.2, and surprisingly little is known about the neuronal function of Cav1.3 in the CNS. Until recently, this was mainly because of a lack of selective pharmacological tools, selective agonist or antagonist, for distinguishing Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 subtypes. To elucidate the neuronal function of Cav1.3 and its cellular mechanisms in the CNS, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen of the rat brain cDNA library with the N terminus of rat Cav1.3 α1 subunit (Cav1.3-NT) as bait and isolated a partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2-NT) as a binding partner. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a multigene family of channel proteins that mediate Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum. Three different genes coding for isoforms of RyRs have been identified and cloned (RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3). For all three isoforms of RyRs, mRNA has been detected in the brain, with RyR2 mRNA showing the most abundant expression (15Furuichi T. Furutama D. Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4794-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been reported that spatial learning induces changes in RyR2 mRNA and protein in the rat hippocampus (17Cavallaro S. Meiri N. Yi C.L. Musco S. Ma W. Goldberg J. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9669-9673Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Zhao W. Meiri N. Xu H. Cavallaro S. Quattrone A. Zhang L. Alkon D.L. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In muscle, the function of RyRs is extremely important for triggering muscle contraction. It is now widely accepted that RyRs are physically linked with L-type Ca2+ channels, providing an amplification of the Ca2+ signal necessary to trigger contraction (19Leong P. MacLennan D.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 681-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Niggli E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 311-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, this coupling between L-type Ca2+ channels and RyRs has not been well characterized in the CNS. In this study, we demonstrate a physical interaction between the Cav1.3 α1 subunit and RyR2 using yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry assays. In addition, we demonstrate that the activation of L-type Ca2+ channels, especially via Cav1.3, is also functionally coupled with an increase in intracellular Ca2+ from RyR-sensitive Ca2+ stores, and a further increase in the RyR mRNA level in rat hippocampal neurons. Plasmid Construction and Yeast Two-hybrid Methods—Full-length rat neuronal Cav 1.3 cDNA, GenBank™ accession number AF370009 (21Xu W. Lipscombe D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 16: 5944-5951Crossref Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. D. Lipscombe (Brown University, Providence, RI). A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using Matchmaker GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech). To construct bait, cDNA fragments encoding the N terminus of Cav1.3 (Cav1.3-NT) cDNA (amino acids 1–151) were subcloned into the NdeI/SalI sites of Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector, pGBKT7, and then bait plasmid was transformed into yeast strain AH109. The rat brain cDNA library in GAL4 activation domain vector pACT2 (prey) was kindly provided by Dr. P. Voisin (University of Poitiers, France) and further transformed into yeast strain Y187. For the yeast two-hybrid screen of rat brain cDNA library with Cav1.3-NT cDNA, the corresponding AH109 yeast strains (MATα) were mated with the Y187 yeast strain (MATa). The diploid colonies were plated on a nutritionally selective plate deficient in adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan (-Ade, -His, -Leu, -Trp) to screen the library. False positives were eliminated using two reporters, ADE2 and HIS3, and MEL1 encoding α-galactosidase was assayed on X-α-gal indicator plates. Doubly positive clones were isolated and characterized by DNA sequencing. β-Galactosidase activities for a yeast two-hybrid assay were measured using a colony lift assay in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Briefly, yeast cells were lifted onto a Whatman No. 5 filter paper, permeabilized by immersion in liquid nitrogen for 20 s, thawed at room temperature, and placed onto two sheets of pre-wetted filter papers in Z-buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 5-bromo-4 chloro-3-indolyl-d-galatopyranoside (1 mg/ml). Hippocampal Cell Cultures—Cultured hippocampal neurons were prepared using the technique modified from Kim et al. (22Kim S. Kim T. Ahn K. Park W.K. Nah S.Y. Rhim H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hippocampi were isolated from 16–18-day-old fetal Sprague-Dawley rats and incubated with 0.25% trypsin in Leibovitz L-15 medium (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then mechanically dissociated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes by trituration and plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips or culture dishes. Cultures were maintained in Neurobasal/B27 medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 25 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Because astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) is known to facilitate neuronal differentiation and network formation in hippocampal neurons (23Sukhareva M. Smith S.V. Maric D. Barker J.L. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we added ACM into Neurobasal/B27 medium through an entire culture procedure. ACM was generated by the incubation of a confluent carpet of astrocyte type 1 according to the method reported previously (24Liu Q.Y. Schaffner A.E. Li Y.X. Dunlap V. Barker J.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2912-2923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stored at -70 °C, and added to Neurobasal/B27 medium before use. Experiments were carried out on neurons after 5–10 days in vitro (DIV). Cell Transfection—Hippocampal neurons were transfected after 5 DIV using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the modified manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the Cav1.3-NT construct in pCMV-2B vector (Clontech) or each siRNA and the Lipofectamine 2000 diluted in B27-free Neurobasal medium were combined and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Culture media were removed and saved; the DNA or siRNA/Lipofectamine 2000 mixture was added to the cells, and the dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The saved culture media were then returned to the dish, and the culture was returned to the incubator for 48 h. To monitor transfection efficiency, the GFP expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was co-transfected with the Cav1.3-NT construct or each siRNA. For each Ca2+ imaging experiment, the transfected cells without GFP vector were loaded with Fura-2/AM after separately confirming transfection efficiency (>80%). Intracellular Ca2+ Imaging—The acetoxymethyl ester form of fura-2 (fura-2/AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. Cells were incubated for 40–60 min at room temperature with 5 μm fura-2/AM and 0.001% Pluronic F-127 in a HEPES-buffered solution composed of 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The cells were then washed with HEPES-buffered solution and placed on an inverted microscope (Olympus, Japan). The cells were illuminated using a xenon arc lamp, and the required excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) were selected by means of a computer-controlled filter wheel (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Emitter fluorescence light was reflected through a 515-nm long pass filter to a frame transfer cooled CCD camera, and the ratios of emitted fluorescence were calculated using a digital fluorescence analyzer. All imaging data were collected and analyzed using Meta Imaging software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Saline with 60 mm KCl (high-K) was made by replacing an equivalent amount of NaCl. Neuronal Cell Death Assay—Hippocampal cell cultures were washed with a HEPES-buffered solution, and then incubated with 60 mm KCl for 30 min to 2 h at 37 °C. Neuronal cell viability was then measured by the detection of dehydrogenase activity that was retained in living cells using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (25Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 16: 55-63Crossref Scopus (46884) Google Scholar). An aliquot (50 μl) of MTT solution (1 mg/ml) in PBS was directly added to the cultures, and the cultures were then incubated for 4 h to allow MTT to metabolize to formazan. The supernatant was then aspirated, and 100 μl of Me2SO was added to dissolve the formazan. Absorbances were measured with an automated spectrophotometric plate reader at a wavelength of 560 nm. Cell viability was expressed as relative percentages in comparison with untreated controls. Total RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—The total RNA from each sample was extracted using easy-BLUE™ kit (iNtRON Biotech, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA samples were treated with DNase I before cDNA synthesis and quantified using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Single strand cDNAs were then synthesized in a reverse transcription reaction in the presence of 2 μg of total RNA, 0.1 nmol of specific antisense primer, and the first-strand cDNA synthesis mix (iNtRON Biotech) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm of each dNTP, and 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The sequences of the sense (+) and antisense (-) primer pairs used for specific amplification of rat L-type Ca2+ channels, RyRs, and controls were as follows: Cav1.2 (+)5′-GACAACCTGGCTGATGCGGAGAGCCTGAC-3′ and (-)5′-ATGCGGTGGCACTGCAGGCGGAACCTG-3′ (GenBank™ accession number NM_012517, product size 401 bp); Cav1.3 (+)5′-GGTCACTTTGCTCCGACGTATCCAGCC-3′ and (-)5′-GTTTGGAGTCTTCTGGTTCGTCATCTT-3′ (GenBank™ accession number NM_017298, product size 500 bp); RyR1 (+)5′-CGGGCCGTGAACTTCTGCT-3′ and (-)5′-CTGTCAGGAATGGAACCACT-3′ (GenBank™ accession number AF112256, product size 150 bp); RyR2 (+)5′-CTACTCAGGATGAGGTGCGA-3′ and (-)5′-CTCTCTTCAGATCCAAGCCA-3′ (GenBank™ accession number AF112257, product size 157 bp); RyR3 (+) 5′-GTGTCAAACTAGTCATTGCCAA-3′ and (-)5′-ATCCTGTCATCTGTAACTCACAA-3′ (GenBank™ accession number XM_342491, product size 445 bp); phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) (+)5′-AGGTGCTCAACAACATGGAG-3′ and (-) 5′-TACCAGAGGCCACAGTAGCT-3′ (conserved sequence of human, rat, and mouse, product size 183 bp); and β-actin (+)5′-GTCACCAACTGGGACGACATG-3′ and (-) 5′-GCCGTCAGGCAGCTCGTAGC-3′ (conserved sequence of human, rat, and mouse, product size 510 bp). Using these primers, amplification of cDNA fragments was performed on PCR through 25–28 cycles with 1 μl of each RT product as a template DNA in 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.1) buffer containing 18 mm (NH4)2SO4, 16 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm of each dNTP, 0.1 nmol of each primer, and Ex-TaqDNA polymerase (Takara, Japan). Each sample (5 μl) of final PCR product was separated using a 1.5–2.5% agarose gel and visualized using UV fluorescence after staining with ethidium bromide for 15 min. Template controls, β-actin or PGK1, were included in each run. Small Interfering RNA—siRNA sequences of rat Cav1.2 (sense, 5′-CGUCCUUGCUGAACUCACUdTdT-3′, and antisense, 3′-dTdTGCAGGAACGACUUGAGUGA-5′; NM_012517), Cav1.3 (sense, 5′-CGAGAGAGGUCAAAGGUGAdTdT-3′, and antisense, 3′-dTdTGCUCUCUCCAGUUUCCACU-5′; NM_017298), and scrambled siRNA (negative, sense, 5′-CCUACGCCACCAAUUUCGUdTdT-3′, and antisense, 3′-dTdTGGAUGCGGUGGUUAAAGCA-5′) were designed using siRNA target finder software (Turbo si-Designer, Bioneer, Korea), and two single-strand RNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and annealed to form the siRNA duplex. Each siRNA at the concentration of 5 pmol/μl was transferred into primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons (5 DIV) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Age- and weight-controlled adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (60–70 days old, 230–260 g) were used for co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. After the cerebral cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, and spinal cord were isolated, they were separately frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground, and homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitor mixture). The solution was incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged for 15 min (4 °C) at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected. The concentration of total protein was determined by the modified Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed using the ProFound mammalian co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). Briefly, lysates were precleared by incubation with the control gel component for 4 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysates were then added to antibody-coupled gels containing anti-Cav1.2 (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), anti-Cav1.3 (Alomone Labs), anti-RyR2 (clone c3-33, Sigma), or rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) antibody. After incubation for 16 h at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed four times with the immunoprecipitation buffer and once with reduced salt immunoprecipitation buffer (125 mm NaCl) before elution. For the detection of RyR2, protein samples were separated on a 3–12% gradient SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was first blocked with PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. After three washes, the membranes were incubated with anti-Cav1.2 (1:150 dilution), anti-Cav1.3 (1:150 dilution), or anti-RyR2 (1:100 dilution) antibodies for 20 h at room temperature in PBS containing 1% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20. For a positive control, anti-β-actin antibodies (1:2500 dilution, Sigma) were incubated for 1 h. After three washes, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in PBS containing 3% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. The signal resulting from the immunoreactivity was detected using Western blot detection reagent (Elipis Biotech, Korea). Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemistry, cultured hippocampal neurons were grown on culture slides (BD Biosciences), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS for 20 min at 4 °C, and washed three times in PBS. The cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min, washed three times in PBS, and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with anti-Cav1.3 (1:200) and anti-RyR2 (1:100) antibodies. Next, the cells were washed three times and incubated with FITC- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times, mounted on glass slides using CRYSTAL/MOUNT™ (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA), and viewed on a confocal FV 1000 SPD laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Japan). Expression of Recombinant Proteins and Pulldown Assay—GST-NT, GST-NT1, GST-NT2, and GST-NT3 plasmids were constructed by cloning Cav1.3-NT (amino acids: 1–151), NT1 (amino acids: 1–60), NT2 (amino acids: 45–115), and NT3 (amino acids: 90–151) domains from pGBKT7/NT into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST, GST-NT, GST-NT1, GST-NT2, and GST-NT3 plasmids were transformed into the bacterial host strain BL21 (DE3) and induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C during midlog phase. The cells were sonicated in lysis buffer (1× PBS (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture). GST, GST-NT, GST-NT1, GST-NT2, and GST-NT3 proteins were immobilized by glutathione-agarose 4B. For GST pulldown assays using rat hippocampal lysates, hippocampal lysates were prepared from age- and weight-controlled adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (60–70 days old and 230–260 g). Rat hippocampi were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitor mixture). The solution was incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged for 15 min (4 °C) at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected. GST pulldown assays were performed using the Profound pulldown GST protein-protein interaction kit (Pierce). Immobilized GST, GST-NT, GST-NT1, GST-NT2, and GST-NT3 proteins were incubated with prepared hippocampal lysates. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 10 min at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer followed by immunoblotting with anti-RyR2 (1:100 dilution) and anti-GST antibodies (1:5000 dilution; Novagen). Statistical Analysis—To quantify the results obtained from RT-PCR analysis, the optic density of RT-PCR product bands was measured using the AphaEase program (version 5.1, Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) and analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 4 program (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was performed on the data using unpaired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Identification of RyR2 as a Cav1.3 Binding Protein Using the Yeast Two-hybrid System—To identify the function of Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels and its cellular mechanism in the CNS, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using Cav1.3-NT as bait (Fig. 1A). After screening the rat brain cDNA library, we identified that RyR2-NT interacted with Cav1.3-NT. To confirm this specific interaction, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid assay using Cav1.3-NT cDNA (bait) transformed in the AH109 yeast strain and RyR2-NT cDNA (prey) transformed into the Y187 yeast strain. When both the AH109 and Y187 yeast strains were mated, a blue color was detected with a β-galactosidase colony-lift filter assay (Fig. 1B), suggesting a positive interaction between Cav1.3-NT-(1–151) and RyR2-NT-(3150–3680). Expression Profiles of Cav1.3 and RyRs in the Rat CNS—Before characterizing the physical and functional interaction between Cav1.3 and RyR2, we examined the expression profiles of Cav1.2, Cav1.3, and RyRs (RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3) in the adult rat brain to find brain regions in which both proteins are highly expressed. Using RT-PCR analysis, we observed that RyR2 mRNA is the most abundant of the three RyRs isoforms in the CNS (Fig. 2A). In particular, the hippocampus had a significantly high level of RyR2 mRNA expression. Although it is not as prominent as RyR2, the high level of Cav1.3 mRNA was also detected in the thalamus, cerebellum, and hippocampus, whereas the expression level of Cav1.2 mRNA was high in the cortex and thalamus. The expression profiles for Cav1.2, Cav1.3, and RyR2 proteins were also examined using a Western blot assay (Fig. 2B). When anti-Cav1.3 and anti-RyR2 antibodies were used to recognize the Cav1.3 α1 subunit (260 kDa) and RyR2 (565 kDa), relatively high expression was detected in the hippocampus. However, the expression level of Cav1.2 was very low in the hippocampus as compared with Cav1.3 and RyR2 when the Cav1.2 α1 subunit (240 kDa) was detected using anti-Cav1.2 antibodies. These results demonstrate high expression of both proteins in the hippocampus, and thus, we chose this structure to further study the physical and functional interaction between Cav1.3 and RyR2. We also examined the developmental expression profiles of Cav1.3 and RyRs (RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3) in the hippocampus. Rats from embryonic day 18 (E18) to postnatal day 70 (adult) were used for RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C, RyR1 and RyR3 mRNA were homogeneously detected throughout development. In contrast, RyR2 mRNA was differentially expressed throughout various developmental stages. Although RyR2 mRNA was dimly detected at an early stage, it continuously increased throughout development and was maintained at a high level in adults. The expression profile of Cav1.3 mRNA was also observed in a similar way; weak during early development and high in adult animals. RyR2 Associates with Cav1.3 in Native Tissue and Co-localizes in Cultured Neurons—Although the above results suggest the interaction between Cav1.3-NT and RyR2-NT, it is necessary to demonstrate the association of endogenous Cav1.3 and RyR2 proteins in native tissues. We therefore attempted to determine whether RyR2 selectively binds to Cav1.3 in adult rat hippocampus using an in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assay. Cell lysates from adult rat hippocampi were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-Cav1.3 or anti-Cav1.2 antibodies, and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-RyR2 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3A, RyR2 selectively bound to endogenous Cav1.3 (last lane) in the rat hippocampus, whereas no signal was detected in immunoprecipitates from controls using a nonimmobilized control gel (N1, 2nd lane) and IgG·Bind gel (N2, 3rd lane). However, RyR2 proteins were not detected when co-immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Cav1.2 antibodies and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-RyR2 antibodies (Fig. 3B). When co-immunoprecipitation was performed in reverse with anti-RyR2 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-Cav1.3 (Fig. 3C) or anti-Cav1.2 (Fig. 3D) antibodies, the result was the same (last lanes); Cav1.3, but not Cav1.2, proteins were detected when co-immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-RyR2 antibodies. These results strongly suggest that the specific binding of RyR2 to Cav1.3, but not Cav1.2, occurs in native brain tissue. For a close functional relationship between two proteins, a common requirement of the specific interaction is that Cav1.3 and RyR2 must be positioned in close proximity. Therefore, we determined whether both proteins are co-localized in the same cellular compartments in cultured hippocampal neuron, which were later used for examining functional interactions between Cav1.3 and RyR2. Cav1.3 was immunostained with rabbit anti-Cav1.3 and then FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. RyR2 was immunostained with mouse anti-RyR2 and then rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. As illustrated in Fig. 3E, immunofluorescence analysis using confocal microscopy revealed that Cav1.3 was predominantly localized on plasma membranes of the cell body and dendrites and was co-localized with RyR2. These double-labeling results revealed t"

The scaffold proteins that assemble these kinase complexes are poorly characterized. We show here that TANK/ITRAF is required for the TBK1- and IKKϵ-mediated IRF3/7 phosphorylations through some Toll-like receptor-dependent pathways and is part of a TRAF3-containing complex. Moreover, TANK is dispensable for the early phase of double-stranded RNA-mediated IRF3 phosphorylation. Interestingly, TANK is heavily phosphorylated by TBK1-IKKϵ upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation and is also subject to lipopolysaccharide- and TBK1-IKKϵ-mediated Lys63-linked polyubiquitination, a mechanism that does not require TBK1-IKKϵ kinase activity. Thus, we have identified TANK as a scaffold protein that assembles some but not all IRF3/7-phosphorylating TBK1-IKKϵ complexes and demonstrated that these kinases possess two functions, namely the phosphorylation of both IRF3/7 and TANK as well as the recruitment of an E3 ligase for Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of their scaffold protein, TANK.

The innate immunity in response to a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns is established upon binding of their molecular components on specific receptors and ultimately leads to the transcriptional induction of type I interferon (IFN) 8The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; IFN, interferon; IKK, IκB kinase; IRF, interferon-regulatory factor; ISRE, interferon-stimulated response element; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Myd88, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; TANK, TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase-1; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; TRIF, Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β-mediated transcription factor activation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ub, ubiquitin; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. genes. Signaling pathways triggered by these viral or bacterial products occur through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) or the cytosolic receptor pathway, and both of them rely on the coordinated activation of transcriptional factors, among which the interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) are critical for the immune response (1Kato H.

TLRs are members of the so-called pattern recognition receptor family, are mainly expressed on immune system sentinel cells, and specifically sense a variety of molecules produced by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa (5Akira S.

For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria binds TLR4, triggering two distinct signaling pathways, namely the Myd88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways. The Myd88-dependent pathway relies on the scaffold proteins TAB2, TAB3, and TRAF6 and ultimately leads to TAK1- and IKK-mediated NF-κB activation and subsequent induction of proinflammatory genes (7Sato S.

The TRIF-dependent pathway targets IRF3/7 for phosphorylation through a TBK1-IKKϵ-dependent mechanism, a critical step for type I IFN induction (2Honda K. Kim T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). More recently, a TRAF3- and TBK1-IKKϵ-dependent pathway has also been characterized and appears to be required for the induction of the type I interferons and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (9Hacker H. Kim V. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Hsu L.C. Wang G.G. Kamps M.P. Raz E. Wagner H. Hacker G. Mann M. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 439: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 10Oganesyan G.

How TBK1 and IKKϵ are assembled into functional IRF3/7-phosphorylating complexes is poorly understood. To date, NAP1 is the only NAK/TBK1-interacting scaffold protein identified in the dsRNA-mediated TLR3-dependent, Myd88-independent pathway (11Sasai M. Kim H. Matsumoto M. Inoue N. Fujita F. Nakanishi M. Seya T. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether NAP1 is involved in other TLR-dependent pathways or whether other scaffold proteins are required. TANK (also known as I-TRAF) was initially described as a TRAF2/3-interacting molecule that positively regulates NF-κB (12Cheng G. Kim D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) through an interaction with IKKϵ (also called IKK-I) (13Peters R.T. Kim S.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 14Nomura F. Kim T. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and TBK1 (15Pomerantz J.L. Kim D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TANK/I-TRAF was also characterized as a signaling molecule that negatively regulates NF-κB through its C-terminal domain, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear (16Kaye K.M. Kim O. Harada J.N. Izumi K.M. Yalamanchili R. Kieff E. Mosialos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11085-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 17Rothe M. Kim J. Shu H.B. Williamson K. Goddard A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8241-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A role for TANK in NF-κB signaling was further supported by the association of TANK with NEMO/IKKγ, a subunit of the IKK complex (18Chariot A. Kim A. Muller J. Bonif M. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37029-37036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This provides a link by which the TANK-interacting TBK1-IKKϵ kinases are connected to the IKK complex for subsequent phosphorylation of NF-κB proteins, such as p65 or c-Rel (19Adli M. Kim A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26976-26984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 20Harris J. Kim S. Sharma S. Sun Q. Lin R. Hiscott J. Grandvaux N. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that TANK acts as a scaffold protein (14Nomura F. Kim T. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Chariot A. Kim A. Muller J. Bonif M. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37029-37036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Since the TANK-binding kinases TBK1-IKKϵ are essential for IRF3/7 activation (21Fitzgerald K.A. Kim S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar, 22Sharma S. Kim B.R. Grandvaux N.

J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), this suggested that TANK may be involved in this and possibly other signaling pathways. Whereas NF-κB activation through multiple signaling pathways relies on sequentially activated kinases, which ultimately target the inhibitory IκB proteins for phosphorylation and subsequent degradative Lys48-linked polyubiquitination (24Karin M. Kim Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4100) Google Scholar, 25Hayden M.S. Kim S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar), evidence is accumulating that Lys63-linked, nondegradative polyubiquitination of critical scaffold proteins is also essential for IKK and subsequent NF-κB activations (26Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 27Sebban H. Kim S. Courtois G. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 569-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Apart from TRAF6 (28Wang C. Kim L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar), NEMO/IKKγ is the best known example of an NF-κB-activating scaffold protein subject to Lys63-linked polyubiquitination, and several signaling pathways specifically target distinct lysine residues of NEMO/IKKγ (27Sebban H. Kim S. Courtois G. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 569-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Israel A. Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 395-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This NEMO/IKKγ post-translational modification occurs upon TNFα stimulation and appears to require the E3 ligase c-IAP-1 (30Tang E.D. Kim C.Y. Xiong Y. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37297-37305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Wu C.J. Kim D.B. Li T. Srinivasula S.M. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). It also occurs upon T cell receptor signaling, where it relies on MALT-1, a Bcl10-interacting protein potentially acting as an E3 ligase (32Zhou H. Kim I. O'Rourke K. Ultsch M. Seshagiri S. Eby M. Xiao W. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ also occurs through a Nod2-dependent pathway, but the E3 ligase in that signaling cascade remains to be identified (33Abbott D.W. Kim A. Asara J.M. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2217-2227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This nondegradative polyubiquitination typically requires the E2 protein Ubc13, and although the essential role of this protein in NF-κB activation in vivo has recently been questioned, it appears that other pathways, such as those leading to MAPK activation, also involve Lys63-linked and Ubc13-dependent polyubiquitination (34Yamamoto M. Kim T. Takeda K. Sato S. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Saitoh T. Yamamoto N. Sakurai H. Ishii K.J. Yamaoka S. Kawai T. Matsuura Y. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Like NF-κB activation, the TLR-dependent pathways leading to IRF3/7 activation also rely on sequentially activated kinases, but the extent to which nondegradative Lys63-linked polyubiquitination is required for these signaling pathways is unknown. To identify scaffold proteins in the TLR- and TBK1-IKKϵ-dependent pathways and concomitantly learn more about the biological functions of TANK, we searched for TANK-interacting proteins in a yeast two-hybrid screen. TANK was found associated with IRF7 and connects TBK1-IKKϵ to this protein for subsequent phosphorylation in the TLR- and Myd88-dependent pathways in macrophages. Moreover, we show that TANK is phosphorylated and also subject to Lys63-linked polyubiquitination, both events requiring TBK1-IKKϵ. Whereas LPS-mediated TANK phosphorylation requires TBK1-IKKϵ kinase domains, the Lys63-linked TANK polyubiquitination does not require these domains but is TRAF3-dependent. Thus, our results identify TANK/I-TRAF as a signaling molecule positively regulating transcription of type I interferons through some TLR-dependent pathways. We also provide evidence for TBK1-IKKϵ acting both as IRF3/7 phosphorylating kinases and also as molecules required for the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of their scaffold protein TANK. Cell Culture, Biological Reagents, and Mice—Human embryonic kidney 293 and HeLa cells were maintained as described (35Leonardi A. Kim A. Claudio E. Cunningham K. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

CD14-stably expressing THP1 cells, a gift from Dr. P. Tobias (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with fetal bovine serum, glutamine, antibiotics, and G418. LPS (0111:B4), mouse TNFα, poly(I:C), and CpG DNA (ODN 1826) were purchased from Sigma, Roche Applied Science, Amersham Biosciences, and Invivogen (San Diego, CA), respectively, whereas staurosporin and female BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were maintained and bred in the laboratory of Parasitology (University of Brussels, Belgium). For isolation of peritoneal macrophages from these mice, sterile inflammation was induced by intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate 3% in phosphate-buffered saline. Inflammatory peritoneal exudate cells were harvested 48 h after injection using 10 ml of ice-cold and sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Peritoneal macrophages were selected by adherence on cell dishes and were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 5% low endotoxin fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Polyclonal anti-human TANK rabbit antibodies were previously described (18Chariot A. Kim A. Muller J. Bonif M. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37029-37036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These purified antibodies were used to detect endogenous polyubiquitinated forms of TANK (see below). Anti-Myc, -TRAF3, and -IκBα antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) as were anti-HA beads. Anti-FLAG antibodies and beads were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-IKKϵ and -TBK1 antibodies were from Imgenex (San Diego, CA), whereas polyclonal anti-TBK1 antibody was from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). The polyclonal and the monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibodies were purchased from BIOMOL International (Exeter, UK) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The recombinant TBK1 kinase used to assess TANK and IRF3 phosphorylations in vitro was from Invitrogen. Human FLAG-TANK and truncation mutants of TANK were previously described, as were FLAG-TANK ΔIKKϵ, FLAG-TANKΔZnF, FLAG-IKKϵ, and the wild type and kinase-dead IKKϵ-Myc constructs (18Chariot A. Kim A.

The GST-IRF3/7 and -TANK constructs were subcloned by PCR-amplifying the C-terminal portion of IRF3/7 (22Sharma S. Kim B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) and the full-length TANK coding sequence into the pGex-6P3 (Amersham Biosciences). The corresponding purified fusion proteins were used as substrates for the kinase assays (see below). The pCW7 Myc-tagged wild type and the pCW8 K48R ubiquitin constructs were a gift from R. Kopito (Department of Biological Sciences, Stanford University), whereas both the Myc-tagged K63R and the K48R/K63R ubiquitin expression constructs were generated by mutagenesis according to standard protocols, using primers whose sequences are available upon request. The previously described HA-tagged ubiquitin as well as the HA-Ub (K0) were provided by Dr. Yarden (Department of Biological Regulation, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israël) (38Mosesson Y.

Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The cDNA encoding TANK (amino acids 306–425) was cloned in frame into the GAL4 DNA-binding vector pGADT7 (Clontech). This plasmid was used as bait in a two-hybrid screen of a human HeLa cDNA library in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y187, according to the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System II Protocol (Clontech). Positive yeast clones were selected for their ability to grow in the absence of histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. Colonies were subsequently tested for β-galactosidase activity, and DNA sequences from positive clones were identified by sequencing. Immunoprecipitations and Kinase Assays—For immunoprecipitations involving overexpressed proteins, 293 cells (3 × 106) were transfected via FUGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with expression vectors as indicated in the figures. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5% Triton lysis buffer. Ectopically expressed FLAG- or Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by using anti-FLAG or -Myc antibodies bound to agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. For anti-TANK immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were incubated with the polyclonal anti-TANK antibody for 2 h followed by an overnight incubation with protein A-agarose. All of the immunoprecipitates were then washed five times with 0.5% Triton lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE for subsequent Western blot analyses. To assess IRF3/7 phosphorylation, anti-TANK or -TBK1 immunoprecipitates were used in immune complex kinase assays using a purified GST-IRF3/7 as substrate, as described (36Leonardi A. Kim H. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To assess TANK or IRF3 phosphorylation in vitro, the corresponding purified GST fusion proteins were incubated with a recombinant TBK1 kinase, as previously described (36Leonardi A. Kim H. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In Vivo Ubiquitin Conjugation Assays—293 cells were transfected with Myc- or HA-ubiquitin and either FLAG-TANK or FLAG-TANK mutants together with the indicated expression vectors, according to the protocol described above. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed, and total cell extracts were subjected to anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations using the anti-FLAG beads, as described above. The ubiquitin-conjugated TANK proteins were subsequently detected by performing anti-Myc or -HA Western analyses. For detection of endogenous polyubiquitinated forms of TANK, cell extracts were lysed as described (30Tang E.D. Kim C.Y. Xiong Y. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37297-37305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and subsequently incubated overnight with the purified anti-TANK antibody followed by a 2-h incubation with protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were subsequently subjected to anti-Ub western analyses. RNA Interference and Luciferase Assays—For RNA interference, decreased Ubc13 expression was obtained by transfecting a SMART POOL of Ubc13 (Dharmacon, CO) using the oligofectamine reagent according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). For generation of the shRNA constructs targeting either green fluorescent protein (control) or the TANK transcript, inserts were cloned into the pLL3.7 lentivirus according to the protocol kindly provided by Dr. L. van Parijs (MIT, Boston, MA) (39Rubinson D.A. Kim C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Ihrig M.M. McManus M.T. Gertler F.B. Scott M.L. Van Parijs L. Nat.

For TRAF3 depletion in human macrophages, THP1/CD14 cells were transfected with either the MISSION shRNA lentiviral construct targeting the TRAF3 transcript or the MISSION nontarget shRNA control vector, as described by the manufacturer (Sigma). For luciferase assays, 293 cells (4 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well (35-mm) plates. After 12 h, cells were transfected as described above with 1 μg of the reporter plasmid and with expression plasmids as indicated. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding empty expression vector DNA as needed. Cell extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection, and reporter gene activity was determined by the luciferase assay system (Roche Applied Science). A pGL4.74 plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to normalize for transfection efficiencies. TANK Associates with IRF3 and IRF7 through its C-terminal Domain—In order to identify TANK-dependent signaling pathways other that those leading to NF-κB activation, we searched for proteins that physically interact with this scaffold protein by means of a yeast two-hybrid screen. The C-terminal domain of TANK (amino acids 306–425) fused to the DNA binding domain of the GAL4 transcription factor (Fig. 1A, left) was used to screen a human HeLa cDNA library that expresses the encoded proteins as fusions with the GAL4 transactivation domain. Among clones that were scored positive for interaction with the bait, one encoded the C-terminal domain and regulatory region of IRF7 (Fig. 1A, right). The interaction between IRF7 and TANK was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Ectopically expressed Myc-tagged IRF7 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-TANK in 293 cells (Fig. 1B, top, left, lane 2). Myc-tagged IRF3 also bound FLAG-TANK (Fig. 1B, top, right, lane 2). To confirm that the C-terminal domain of TANK is required for binding to IRF3/7 in mammalian cells, similar coimmunoprecipitations were performed with extracts from 293 cells transfected with Myc-IRF7 and either FLAG-TANK or various TANK mutants deleted in the C-terminal domain. Wild type TANK bound IRF7, but a TANK mutant lacking the 178 C-terminal amino acids did not (Fig. 1C, top, lanes 2 and 6, respectively). A TANK mutant with two point mutations within its zinc finger motif (“TANKΔZnF”), which disrupt a NEMO-binding domain (37Bonif M. Kim M.A. Close P. Benoit V. Heyninck K. Chapelle J.P. Bours V. Merville M.P. Piette J. Beyaert R. Chariot A. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), still associated with IRF7, as did TANKΔC20 and TANKΔC50 (Fig. 1C, top, lanes 3–5). Therefore, TANK binds IRF7 through a C-terminal region that is distinct from the domain required for association with NEMO/IKKγ. TANK Enhances IFN Transcription through TBK1 and IKKϵ-mediated IRF3/7 Activation—Because TBK1-IKKϵ-mediated IRF3/7 phosphorylation is essential for the transcriptional induction of type I interferon and subsequent development of the innate response, we next determined whether TANK, as a TBK1-IKKϵ- and IRF3/7-binding protein, is involved in IRF3/7 activation. 293 cells were transfected with the ISRE reporter plasmid, which harbors an IRF3/7-responsive element, and luciferase assays were performed. As expected, increasing amounts of IRF3/7 led to a dose-dependent activation of the ISRE reporter; TANK overexpression alone did not (Fig. 1, D and E, respectively). The addition of increasing amounts of TANK weakly enhanced IRF3-mediated activation of the ISRE promoter and more strongly induced IRF7 transactivation potential (Fig. 1, D and E, respectively). TANK also enhanced TBK1- and IKKϵ-mediated activation of the ISRE promoter (Fig. 1, F and G). Therefore, these results suggest that TANK positively regulates TBK1- and IKKϵ-mediated IRF3/7 activation, presumably by connecting both TANK-interacting kinases to their substrate for its subsequent phosphorylation. TANK Is Part of an IRF3/7-phosphorylating Complex—To explore the hypothesis that TANK connects TBK1-IKKϵ to their substrates, we addressed IRF3/7 phosphorylations in cells overexpressing IKKϵ and either wild type TANK or a mutant lacking the TBK1-IKKϵ-interacting site (“TANKΔIKKϵ”) (18Chariot A. Kim A. Muller J. Bonif M. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37029-37036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) by kinase assays using purified GST-IRF3 or -7 as substrate. In agreement with previous reports, IRF3 and IRF7 were strongly phosphorylated by an anti-FLAG immunoprecipitate derived from FLAG-IKKϵ-but not Myc-IKKϵ-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2A, top, lanes 7 and 3, respectively). Moreover, whereas IRF3/7 phosphorylations were detected by incubating anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates derived from cells expressing both FLAG-TANK and IKKϵ-Myc (Fig. 2A, top, lanes 4), no IRF3/7 phosphorylation was detected using immunoprecipitates derived from cells overexpressing a kinase-dead version of IKKϵ or TANKΔIKKϵ (Fig. 2A, top, lanes 5 and 6, respectively). We conclude, therefore, that TANK connects IKKϵ to IRF3/7 for subsequent phosphorylation. To further explore the significance of the interaction between TANK and TBK/IKKϵ for IRF3/7 activation, we first defined the TANK-interacting site on both kinases by co-immunoprecipitations. TBK1 and IKKϵ harbor a N-terminal kinase domain as well as C-terminal coiled-coil regions (40Huang J. Kim T. Xu L.G. Chen D. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4018-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). C-terminal IKKϵ/TBK1-deletions were generated, and the resulting Myc-tagged wild type and IKKϵ/TBK1 mutants were tested for interaction with FLAG-TANK (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). IKKϵ/TBK1 and IKKϵΔC6/TBK1ΔC6-Myc associated with FLAG-TANK (Fig. 2, B, top, lanes 1 and 3, and C, top, lanes 2 and 4), but IKKϵ/TBK1 mutants lacking 30 or 52 (for IKKϵ) and 30 or 55 (for TBK1) C-terminal amino acids failed to interact with FLAG-TANK (Fig. 2, B, top, lanes 5 and 7, and C, top, lanes 6 and 8). This indicates that IKKϵ and TBK1 interact with TANK through their C-terminal regions downstream of the coiled-coil domains. We next defined the role of the TANK-interacting domain of IKKϵ in IRF3 activation by assessing IRF3 phosphorylation in kinase assays using extracts of cells with ectopic wild type or IKKϵ mutants deleted in the coiled-coil domains (“IKKϵΔC6” or “IKKϵΔC30”) by kinase assays. IRF3 phosphorylation was detected following incubation with anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates derived from cells expressing FLAG-IKKϵ or both FLAG-TANK and wild type but not kinase-dead IKKϵ-Myc (Fig. 2D, top, lanes 6, 2, and 5, respectively). Also, whereas IRF3 phosphorylation was detected in cells overexpressing FLAG-TANK and IKKϵΔC6, (which still interacts with TANK), no IRF3 phosphorylation was detected upon FLAG-TANK and IKKϵΔC30 overexpression (Fig. 2D, top panel, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). This result provides further support for the hypothesis that TANK is associated with an IRF3 kinase, most likely IKKϵ. We next performed a kinase assay with immunoprecipitates of wild type and IKKϵ mutants rather than TANK. As expected, IRF3 phosphorylation was detected using anti-Myc imunoprecipitates derived from cells overexpressing IKKϵ-Myc but not the kinase-dead mutant or FLAG-IKKϵ (Fig. 2E, top, lanes 2, 5, and 6, respectively). IRF3 phosphorylation was also detected in extracts of cells overexpressing IKKϵΔC6 or IKKϵΔC30 (Fig. 2E, top, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Interestingly, whereas IKKϵ autophosphorylation was observed upon overexpression of wild type or the IKKϵΔC6 mutant, such autophosphorylation was disrupted by deleting the last 30 amino acids of IKKϵ (Fig. 2E, top, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). These results suggest that the N-terminal IKKϵ kinase domain is sufficient for IRF3 phosphorylation in vitro, whereas the C-terminal coiled coil domain required for TANK interaction is dispensable for IRF3 phosphorylation but required for IK"

https://openalex.org/W2069591589,"It has been proposed that de novo synthesis of long-chain acyl-CoA (LC-CoA) is a signal for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Key enzymes involved in synthesis of fatty acids from glucose include ATP-citrate lyase (CL) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). An inhibitor of CL, hydroxycitrate (HC), has been reported to inhibit insulin secretion in some laboratories but not in others. Here we show that high concentrations of NaCl created during preparation of HC by standard methods explain the inhibition of GSIS, and that removal of the excess NaCl prevents the effect. To further investigate the role of CL, two small interfering RNA adenoviruses (Ad-siCL2 and Ad-siCL3) were generated. Ad-siCL3 reduced CL mRNA levels by 92 ± 6% and CL protein levels by 75 ± 4% but did not affect GSIS in 832/13 cells compared with cells treated with a control adenovirus (Ad-siControl). Similar results were obtained with Ad-siCL2. Ad-siCL3-treated cells also exhibited a 52 ± 7% reduction in cytosolic oxaloacetate, an 83 ± 4% reduction in malonyl-CoA levels, and inhibition of [U-14C]glucose incorporation into lipid by 43 ± 4%, all expected metabolic out-comes of CL suppression. Similarly, treatment of 832/13 cells with a recombinant adenovirus specific to FAS (Ad-siFAS) reduced FAS mRNA levels by 81 ± 2% in 832/13 cells, resulting in a 59 ± 4% decrease in [U-14C]glucose incorporation into lipid, without affecting GSIS. Finally, treatment of primary rat islets with Ad-siCL3 or Ad-siFAS reduced CL and FAS mRNA levels by 65 ± 4% and 52 ± 3%, respectively, but had no effect on GSIS relative to Ad-siControl-treated islets. These findings demonstrate that a normal rate of flux of glucose carbons through CL and FAS is not required for GSIS in insulinoma cell lines or rat islets.

One glucose-derived signal appears to be a rise in the ATP:ADP ratio, which stimulates closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, resulting in plasma membrane depolarization, activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and Ca2+-mediated stimulation of insulin granule exocytosis (1Prentki M.

This so-called “KATP channel-dependent” mechanism appears to be particularly important in triggering exocytosis of a small number of granules from a plasma membrane-docked “readily releasable pool” responsible for the first, acute phase of insulin release (5Henquin J.C. Kim M.A. Nenquin M. Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 33: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the second and sustained phase of insulin secretion, ATP and Ca2+ may play only limited or permissive roles, allowing other glucose-derived second messengers to come to the forefront (5Henquin J.C. Kim M.A. Nenquin M. Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 33: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Important support for the KATP channel-independent pathways of β-cell glucose signaling came from studies showing that glucose causes a significant increase in insulin secretion even when KATP channels are held open by application of diazoxide and high K+, or in animals in which the SUR1 K+ channel was knocked out (5Henquin J.C.

Understanding the nature of all of the glucose-derived signals for insulin secretion (both KATP channel-dependent and -independent) will be required to understand the functional failure of the β-cell in diabetes and for the development of new drugs for correcting this problem. Recent studies in this area have focused on understanding the metabolic fates of pyruvate in the mitochondria. Islet β-cells express both pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase in abundance, such that in the fed state, pyruvate flows into mitochondrial metabolic pathways in roughly equal proportions through the anaplerotic (PC) and oxidative (pyruvate dehydrogenase) entry points (7Lu D. Kim H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 17Schuit F. Kim A.

Furthermore, islet β-cells contain enzymes that allow “cycling” of pyruvate via its PC-catalyzed conversion to oxaloacetate, metabolism of oxaloacetate to malate, citrate, or isocitrate in the TCA cycle, and subsequent recycling of these metabolites to pyruvate via several possible combinations of cytosolic and mitochondrial pathways (14Jensen M.V.

Thus, GSIS is correlated with PC-catalyzed pyruvate cycling, but not with pyruvate dehydrogenase-catalyzed glucose oxidation in variously glucose responsive INS-1-derived cell lines, and inhibition of pyruvate cycling activity with PC inhibitors impairs GSIS (7Lu D. Kim H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 23Farfari S. Kim V. Corkey B. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). More recent studies have focused on identification of the specific pyruvate cycling pathways that generate signals for insulin secretion. One important step is the export of citrate and/or isocitrate from the mitochondria via the citrate/isocitrate carrier. Pharmacologic or siRNA-mediated suppression of citrate/isocitrate carrier causes substantial impairment of GSIS in both insulinoma cell lines and primary rat islets (16Joseph J.W. Kim M.V. Ilkayeva O. Palmieri F. Alarcon C. Rhodes C.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35624-35632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Once exported to the cytosol, citrate and isocitrate can recycle to pyruvate either via ATP-citrate lyase (CL)-mediated cleavage to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA, or via cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDc)-mediated conversion to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and recycling to pyruvate via mitochondrial enzymes. Support for an important role of the latter pathway comes from our recent demonstration that siRNA-mediated suppression of ICDc impairs GSIS in insulinoma cells and primary rat islets, suggesting that a metabolic byproduct of pyruvate/isocitrate cycling plays an important role in control of GSIS (15Ronnebaum S.M. Kim O. Burgess S.C. Joseph J.W. Lu D. Stevens R.D. Becker T.C. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. Jensen M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30593-30602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Our findings to date do not preclude an independent contribution by a pyruvate/citrate cycling pathway that is initiated by citrate cleavage catalyzed by CL. Indeed, others have proposed a “malonyl-CoA/long-chain acyl-CoA” model of GSIS that holds that PC-mediated anaplerosis is linked to control of insulin secretion via pyruvate/citrate cycling and increases in the levels of byproducts of this pathway, malonyl-CoA, and long-chain acyl-CoAs (LC-CoA) (8Corkey B.E.

Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, treatment of β-cells with glucose causes a rapid rise in malonyl-CoA levels that precedes insulin secretion (8Corkey B.E. Kim M.C. Chen K.S. Deeney J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21608-21612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose stimulation also suppresses fatty acid oxidation, and addition of LC-CoA stimulates insulin granule exocytosis in permeabilized β-cells (24Deeney J.T. Kim J. Hoy M. Olsen H.L. Rhodes C.J.

However, LC-CoA also stimulates KATP channel activity in patch-clamped β-cells (25Branstrom R. Kim I.B. Leibiger B. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol.

Furthermore, prevention of the glucose-induced rise in malonyl-CoA levels by overexpression of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase has no impact on GSIS (27Antinozzi P.A. Kim L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D.

Although malonyl-CoA may not be the direct signal for GSIS, other products of a pyruvate/citrate cycling or lipogenesis pathway initiated by CL cleavage of citrate could play an important role. In the current study, we have investigated the effects of pharmacologic and siRNA-mediated inhibition of CL and fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity in insulinoma cells and primary rat islets. We find that suppression of CL activity in β-cells leads to anticipated metabolic effects, including a fall in cytosolic oxaloacetate and malonyl-CoA levels, and both CL and FAS suppression are accompanied by a decrease in [U-14C]glucose incorporation into lipids. However, CL or FAS suppression have no impact on GSIS. Moreover, we show that previous reports of impairment of GSIS by the CL inhibitor hydroxycitrate were likely influenced by an artifact of very high NaCl levels generated during preparation of hydroxycitrate by standard methods. Elimination of pyruvate/citrate cycling and lipogenesis as important pathways for control of GSIS focuses future work on other pyruvate cycling pathways, most notably the pyruvate/isocitrate and pyruvate/malate cycles. Cell Lines—The INS-1-derived cell line 832/13, which exhibits robust GSIS, was used in these studies (30Hohmeier H.E. Kim H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11.1 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Preparation of Hydroxycitrate—Hydroxycitrate (HC) was solubilized as recommended by the manufacturer (Sigma). Initiallya 5 mm stock solution of HC was prepared by solublization in 10 n HCl and normalization of pH to ∼7.0 with 10 n NaOH. This solution was then diluted to the appropriate concentration (0.3 or 1 mm of HC) in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) and the pH adjusted to 7.4 with 0.1 n NaOH. In the process of makinga 1 mm solution of HC in KRB the NaCl concentration increased by ∼150-172 mm due to the use of strong HCl and NaOH for solubilizing and neutralizing the HC solution. In some experiments, we adjusted for this additional NaCl by subtracting NaCl from the KRB buffer. siRNA Duplexes and Viral Construction—Two siRNA duplexes against ATP-CL (accession number NM016987) were used for adenovirus construction. Relative to the start codon, the 5′ end of the siRNA target sequence corresponded to the following nucleotides in CL: CL2, nucleotide 620 (GCTTCATCTCCGGCCTATT); CL3, nucleotide 1027 (AGTCATAGGTCTGTTGTTC). For FAS the siRNA target sequence corresponded to nucleotide 351 (GCUAUUGUGGACGGAGGUATT). Recombinant adenoviruses were generated containing the siRNA sequences for CL2, CL3, and FAS as previously described (31Becker T.C. Kim R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D.

CL and FAS Immunoblots—CL and FAS protein were detected using standard immunoblotting techniques. Cellular proteins were extracted with cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and pepstatin (5 μg/ml). Extracts (40 μg) were resolved on 3-8% Tris acetate/SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). CL was detected with an antibody against CL (Cell Signaling), FAS with an antibody specific to FAS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA), and tubulin with an antibody specific to γ-tubulin (Sigma). CL Enzymatic Activity—CL enzyme activity was measured by a malate dehydrogenase-coupled method (34Srere P. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2544-2547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were added to a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.7), 20 mm potassium citrate, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 units/ml malate dehydrogenase, 0.33 mm CoASH, 0.14 mm NADH, and 5 mm ATP (all from Sigma). Change in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored every 15 s over 20 min in a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer.

Protein was precipitated from the cytosolic fraction by addition of 0.25 m perchloric acid at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by neutralization with 0.94 m KOH. The perchloric acid precipitate was removed by centrifugation. Supernatant or oxaloacetate standard in perchloric acid (0.2-2.0 pmol) was added to 200 μl of reaction buffer (75 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 80 nm [acetyl-3H]acetyl-CoA, 50 μg/ml citrate synthase) at room temperature for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 600 μl of charcoal mixture (8 g of charcoal, 38 g of citric acid monohydrate, 120 ml of 95% ethanol) followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g and liquid scintillation counting of the supernatant.

Statistics—Statistical significance was assessed by using either Student's t test or by one-way analysis of variance for repeated measures followed by multiple Bonferroni comparisons. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The Effects of HC on GSIS in 832/13 Cells and Isolated Rat Islets—Previous studies have reported that GSIS is impaired by HC, an inhibitor of CL (37Chen S. Kim A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The best solvent for HC is a strong acid such as HCl, but use of this reagent then requires neutralization with a strong base (NaOH). In a first set of experiments, 0.3 or 1 mm HC solutions were prepared with no compensation for the extra NaCl that accumulates. In 832/13 cells, 0.3 mm HC inhibited insulin secretion at 16.7 mm glucose by 44 ± 7% without affecting basal insulin secretion, whereas 1 mm HC caused a 275 ± 5% increase in basal insulin secretion and a 46 ± 5% impairment in insulin secretion at 16.7 mm glucose, effectively eliminating GSIS (Fig. 1A). In isolated rat islets 1 mm HC increased basal insulin secretion by 537 ± 10% and inhibited insulin secretion at 16.7 mm glucose by 33 ± 5% (Fig. 1B). The increase in NaCl concentration caused by solubilization of HC in strong HCl and neutralization with NaOH was calculated to be 150-172 mm. When this amount of NaCl was removed from the KRB, 0.25 and 0.5 mm HC inhibited glucose incorporation into lipids by 18.4 ± 6.2 and 47.6 ± 4.2%, respectively (Fig. 2A), but had no effect on GSIS in 832/13 cells (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2023008686,"Abstract The sufR gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor of the suf regulon in cyanobacteria. It is predicted to contain an N-terminal helix loop helix DNA binding motif and a C-terminal Fe/S binding domain. Through immunoblotting assays of cell extracts, the sufR product in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was shown to have a mass of ∼25 kDa. This indicates that the second ATG in the open reading frame is the correct start codon and that sufR encodes a protein of 216 amino acids (SufR216) rather than the originally predicted 240 amino acids. Recombinant SufR harbored [4Fe-4S]2+, 1+216 clusters, which were present in a mixture of S = 1/2 and 3/2 ground spin states, and the holoprotein was a homodimer, containing 3.7 of non-heme irons and 3.5 labile sulfides per monomer. Thus, two [4Fe-4S]2+, 1+ clusters are coordinated by each SufR216 homodimer. SufR216 bound to two DNA sequences in the regulatory region between the divergently transcribed sufR gene and the sufBCDS operon, and its binding affinity depended on the presence and redox state of the [4Fe-4S]2+, 1+ clusters. A high affinity binding site, which controls sufBCDS expression, and a low affinity binding site, which controls sufR expression, were identified. The SufR binding sites, which are separated by 26 base pairs, each contain a perfect inverted repeat, CAAC-N6-GTTG, and are highly conserved in cyanobacteria. The Fe/S protein SufR thus functions both as a transcriptional repressor of the sufBCDS operon and as an autoregulator of sufR."

Goldfish CSF-1 was encoded for by a 600-bp open reading frame that translates into a predicted peptide of 199 amino acids. Although it had only a 27% amino acid identity with human CSF-1, important cysteine residues required for formation of the CSF-1 homodimer were conserved. Goldfish CSF-1 was highly expressed in the spleen, and its expression was up-regulated in goldfish monocytes after treatment with phorbol esters (PMA). Recombinant goldfish CSF-1 induced differentiation and proliferation of sorted goldfish monocytes. The proliferative effect was abrogated by addition of an anti-CSF-1R antibody and/or soluble goldfish CSF-1R (sCSF-1R), we previously characterized (14Barreda D.R. Kim P.C. Stafford J.L. Belosevic M.

(Mercersburg, PA) and maintained at the Aquatic Facility of the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta. The fish were kept at 20 °C in a flow-through water system and fed to satiation daily with trout pellets. The fish were acclimated to this environment for at least 3 weeks prior to use in experiments. All of the fish ranged from 10 to 15 cm in length and whenever possible an equal number of both sexes was used.Cultivation of Goldfish Macrophages—The culture medium (NMGFL-15) used has been described previously (12Neumann N.F. Kim D. Belosevic M. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1998; 22: 417-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Complete NMGFL-15 medium used for the cultivation of goldfish macrophages contained 5% carp serum and 10% newborn calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Cultures were grown in the absence of CO2 at 20 °C.Isolation and Generation of Primary Kidney Macrophages from Goldfish—Isolation of goldfish kidney leukocytes and the generation of primary kidney macrophages were performed as described previously (12Neumann N.F. Kim D. Belosevic M. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1998; 22: 417-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Three distinct macrophage subpopulations are a feature of primary kidney macrophage cultures that represent macrophage subsets temporally arrested at distinct differentiation junctures in development: the early progenitor cells, the monocyte-like cells, and mature macrophages (19Neumann N.F.

All primers used for sequencing, expression, and cloning of goldfish CSF-1 are shown in Table 1. From this fragment, RACE PCR (BD Biosciences) was performed following the manufacturer’s specifications to obtain the full open reading frame sequence of goldfish CSF-1 from which recombinant expression primers were designed. Sequencing was performed by first cloning the CSF-1 PCR amplicon into the PCR 2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and identifying the colonies that contained positive inserts by colony PCR using the vector-specific M13 primers (Invitrogen). Positive clones were isolated using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using a DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and a PE Applied Biosystems 377 automated sequencer. Single pass sequences were analyzed using Vector NTI (Invitrogen), and subsequent gene annotations were conducted using BLAST programs (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).TABLE 1Primers used for PCR analysisPrimerSequenceConserved CSF-1 senseGTCTGTTACATCAAACAGCATConserved CSF-1 antisenseATGCTGTTTGATGTAACAGACGoldfish CSF-1 qPCR senseACACACATAACAGCCCACAAAGCCGoldfish CSF-1 qPCR antisenseAGCACAGGACAAGGATGAAGCACTActin qPCR senseGCACGCGACTGACACTGAAGActin qPCR antisenseGAAGGCCGCTCCGAGGTAGoldfish CSF-1 pSeqTag2 senseATGACACACATAACAGCCCACAAAGCCGoldfish CSF-1 pSeqTag2 antisenseACAGCTACCTGCTGTTTGGATGAGTAG Open table in a new tab Conserved CSF-1 motifs were identified in the putative amino acid sequence, and subsequent predictions were based on analytical tools provided in the ExPASy proteomics server. Sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX version 1.83.Quantitative PCR Analysis of CSF-1 Expression in Different Tissues—Quantitative PCR analyses were carried out using the Applied Biosystems 7500 fast real time PCR equipment. The relative expression of goldfish CSF-1 in relation to β-actin in the kidney, spleen, liver, heart, gill, intestine, and brain was assessed using primers generated with the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Thermocycling parameters were as follows: 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Analyses of the relative tissue expression data for six fish (n = 6) were carried out using the 7500 Fast software (Applied Biosystems).Real Time PCR Analysis of Goldfish CSF-1 Expression in Sorted Macrophage Subpopulations—Cultured goldfish kidney macrophages were sorted into early progenitor, monocyte, and macrophage subpopulations using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using a protocol we described previously (19Neumann N.F. Kim D.R. Belosevic M. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2000; 10: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and the RNA was isolated immediately after sorting using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s specifications. First strand cDNA synthesis was done using the Superscript II cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The sorted experimental groups each represent the combined data collected from six fish (n = 6). Statistical significance of the data obtained from the quantitative PCR was analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance, and results were deemed to be significant at p < 0.05.Design of Expression Constructs, PCR Amplification, and Cloning—Goldfish CSF-1 was designed for expression using the pSeqTag2 mammalian expression system (Invitrogen). PCR amplification of the expression insert was performed as follows: 7 μl of the CSF-1 clone template was added to 76 μl of double distilled H2O, dNTPs (0.2 μl of each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP 100 mm solutions), 10× PCR buffer (10 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin), expression primers and a 15:1 ratio of Taq:Pfu DNA polymerases (1 μl of 5 units/liter solution). PCR amplification was conducted in an Eppendorf Mastercycler gradient thermal cycler. The amplification program consisted of a 6-min hot start at 94 °C, followed by 28 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 59 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and a final elongation step of 72 °C for 7 min. Amplification was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis.Production of Recombinant CSF-1—Plasmid DNA containing the CSF-1 expression construct was transformed into CHO cells (Invitrogen) for recombinant protein expression. 10 ng of plasmid DNA was transfected into CHO cells using 293fectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. After transfection, cells were transferred to a 25-cm2 culture flask and allowed to sit for 2 days before supernatants were collected and tested for recombinant protein by Western blot using an antibody specific for the His6 tag located on the C-terminal end of the recombinant protein. Cultures that were successfully transfected were placed in a 2-liter culture roller bottle and grown for 7 days at 37 °C after which the supernatants were collected.Purification of Recombinant CSF-1—Supernatants collected from the transfected CHO cells were collected and dialyzed overnight against 1× phosphate-buffered saline and pooled together. Recombinant CSF-1 was purified from dialyzed culture supernatants using MagneHIS beads (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Purified proteins were eluted in a solution containing 100 mm HEPES and 500 mm imidazole, pH 9.0, and then dialyzed overnight against 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were then filter-sterilized in preparation for immunodetection and analysis of biological activity. Total protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The presence of rCSF-1 in the purified sample was confirmed by Western blot, and the identity of the purified protein was ascertained to be goldfish CSF-1 by mass spectrometry. Briefly, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of the anti-His6 primary antibody. Membranes were subsequently washed, incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse IgG monoclonal antibody, and developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium.Measurement of Macrophage Proliferation Induced by Purified rCSF-1—The effect of goldfish rCSF-1 on macrophage proliferation was assessed using the cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent BrdUrd colorimetric assay (Roche Applied Science). This technique was based on the incorporation of the pyrimidine analog, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd), into the DNA of proliferating cells. Macrophages were grown as described above and sorted using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) based on size and complexity. Progenitor cells, monocytes, and macrophages were then counted and seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells well–1 in 96-well culture plates (Falcon). Cells were seeded in 50 μl of incomplete culture medium and treated with 50 μl of 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 ng/ml rCSF-1 mixed with incomplete cell culture medium and incubated with BrdUrd labeling reagent at a concentration of 15 μm. Treatments were re-applied on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 in-between days that samples were collected. Blocking studies were done with the same rCSF-1 concentrations and included into the 50-μl treatment 10, 50, 100, or 250 ng/ml anti-CSF-1R antibody or 10, 25, and 50 ng/ml sCSF-1R. Preincubation with the anti-CSF1R antibody and the sCSF-1R was done over a period of 12 h at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with BrdUrd labeling reagent for 24 h, and then subsequent samples were taken every 2 days from the day 0 time point. The reaction was developed according to the manufacturer’s specifications, and absorbance was determined at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Biotek). In control experiments the colorimetric reaction was found to be directly proportional to the number of proliferating macrophages in culture. Recordings from the nontreated cells were subtracted from the experimental groups to account for the endogenous production of growth factors by goldfish macrophages.Flow Cytometric Analysis of Primary Goldfish Macrophage Cultures—Goldfish macrophages were sorted into progenitor cells, monocyte and macrophage subpopulations on day 4 post-isolation. They were seeded into 12-well plates at a concentration of 3 × 106 cells well–1 in a volume of 3 ml of incomplete medium and exposed to treatments, including 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 ng/ml, in macrophage cell culture medium (CCM), supernatants from untransfected control CHO cells treated in the same way as the rCSF-1, and cells alone. Treatments were re-applied on alternating days to data collection. Every 48 h after treatment the cells in each well were monitored using flow cytometric analysis using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Analysis was performed by measuring the forward (size) and side (internal complexity) scatter light patterns of the cells in each treatment group for eight different fish (n = 8).Goldfish rCSF-1/sCSF-1R Binding Assay—Goldfish rCSF-1 and soluble CSF-1R were biotinylated using the EZ-Link biotinylation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Effective biotinylation of each protein was confirmed using the EZ-Biotin quantitation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To determine whether rCSF-1 formed a homodimer before interacting with its receptor and to see if rCSF-1 and the sCSF-1R interacted in vitro, 100 μg of each protein was incubated in de-ionized water, pH 7.5, for 60 min. The protein mixture was then cross-linked using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) for 15 min and then run on a reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Pierce). The blot was then developed using ECL (Pierce) on x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.).RESULTSAnalysis of Goldfish CSF-1 Transcript and Predicted Peptide Sequences—The expression of goldfish CSF-1 in tissues and in sorted progenitor cells, monocytes, and macrophages was assessed using quantitative real time PCR. Goldfish CSF-1 was strongly expressed in the spleen compared with other tissues (Fig. 1A). Nonstimulated sorted goldfish monocytes were observed to express CSF-1 almost 4-fold more than sorted progenitor cells or sorted macrophages. Interestingly, this expression was increased an additional 7-fold compared with that observed in progenitor cells and macrophages after treatment with 10 ng/ml PMA. PMA was found to significantly increase the expression of CSF-1 message in monocytes by almost 2-fold 12 h after treatment, but had no significant effect on the CSF-1 expression in progenitor cells or macrophages (Fig. 1B). The predicted goldfish CSF-1 peptide was 199 amino acids and featured a secretion signal peptide cleaved at amino acid 29 (Fig. 2A). The peptide was ∼22 kDa with a predicted isoelectric point of 6.6. Goldfish CSF-1 (GenBank™ accession number EU045335) shared its highest amino acid identity with a putative zebrafish CSF-1 (XP001343870) at 89% and a putative trout CSF-1 (CAD88593) at 65%. The amino acid identity between goldfish and human CSF-1 (BAD92189) was only 27%. Importantly, cysteine residues responsible for the formation of the intra-chain and inter-chain disulfide bonds required for functional CSF-1 in mammals were present in the goldfish CSF-1 amino acid sequence. Although these cysteine residues were not in the same positions as the cysteines of the human CSF-1, the distance between the residues was almost identical between the goldfish and human sequences (Fig. 2A). RACE PCR identified three nucleotide sequence variants that differed in the 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 2B). The most common variant sequence occurring in 43 of 60 3′-RACE clones was submitted to GenBank™. The full nucleotide sequence of all variants contained TATA box, poly(A) signal, and poly(A) tail (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2The predicted goldfish CSF-1 (GenBank™ accession number EU045335) amino acid sequence. A, cysteine residues are in boldface, and the secretion signal peptide predicted cleavage site is marked by asterisk. Bold lines indicate cysteine residues that are important for folding and homodimerization in mammalian CSF-1. Numbers indicate the distance between each cysteine residue in the goldfish sequence, and numbers in parentheses indicate the distance between the corresponding cysteine in human CSF-1. B, alignment of three variant goldfish CSF-1 nucleotide sequences. The open reading frame was identical for all three variants, the differences occurring in the 3′-untranslated region. Variants 1–3 were observed 43, 12, and 5 times, respectively, out of 60 3′-RACE clones. The nucleotide sequence of all variants contained TATA box, poly(A) signal (underlined), the start codon (*), and the stop codon (**). Shaded box represents the open reading frame, which was identical in all three variants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Goldfish rCSF-1 Binds to Recombinant Goldfish sCSF-1 Receptor—One hundred μg of biotinylated goldfish rCSF-1 and sCSF-1R were run on an SDS gel in conjunction with rCSF-1 and sCSF-1R cross-linked using BS3. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin and ECL. The sCSF-1R ran at ∼31 kDa as a doublet likely resulting from differing glycosylation of the soluble receptor (Fig. 3A) and the rCSF-1 at ∼26 kDa (Fig. 3B). In the cross-linked sample of rCSF-1, two distinct bands were observed likely representing both monomeric rCSF-1 as well as the homodimeric form, which was ∼50 kDa (Fig. 3C). In the sample containing cross-linked rCSF-1 and sCSF-1R, multiple bands were observed, and bands representing unbound rCSF-1 and sCSF-1R were seen at the predicted Mr, and a band representing homodimeric rCSF-1 was observed as well as a larger band at ∼90 kDa, which represented sCSF-1R bound to the homodimeric form of rCSF-1.FIGURE 3Blot showing the binding of CSF-1 to form a homodimer and binding of CSF-1 to a recombinant soluble CSF-1R.

Cell growth was monitored each day by flow cytometry, and rCSF-1-treated cells were compared with cells treated with CCM (positive control), elution buffer, and nontreated cultures. Progenitor cells and macrophages were not affected by the addition of rCSF-1. However, sorted monocytes were induced to differentiate into mature macrophages much earlier than those incubated in the presence of CCM. The rCSF-1-induced transition of monocytes to macrophages was observed as early as day 2 post-treatment, which was more than 3 days earlier than cultures treated with CCM (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Flow cytometric analysis showing the differentiation of goldfish monocyte-like cells, sorted based on size and internal complexity, after treatment with 10 ng/ml recombinant goldfish CSF-1 or cell-conditioned medium. Flow cytometer gates were identical to those described in our previous paper (12Neumann N.F. Kim D. Belosevic M. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1998; 22: 417-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Analysis shows results taken from day 0, 4, and 8 and is a representative sample taken from cells sorted from eight separate fish and analyzed in the same way.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Goldfish rCSF-1-induced Proliferation of Sorted Goldfish Monocytes and Macrophages—50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 ng/ml of rCSF-1 were used to assess the capacity of goldfish rCSF-1 to induce proliferation of sorted goldfish progenitor cells, monocytes, and macrophages. rCSF-1 induced proliferation in sorted monocytes and macrophages but not progenitor cells. The proliferative response was dose-dependent where 1 ng/ml rCSF-1 induced the lowest response and 10–50 ng/ml induced a strong proliferative response. The proliferative response observed in the monocyte cultures was normalized by subtracting the values for nontreated cells from each experimental value for each fish. As shown in Fig. 5B, 10 ng/ml of rCSF-1 induced a significantly higher proliferative response that the positive control (CCM) as determined by one-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05). In contrast 10 ng/ml rCSF-1 did not induce a significant proliferative response in sorted mature macrophages, although a consistently higher proliferation of mature macrophages was observed from day 2 of cultivation onward (Fig. 5C). Although CCM induced a stronger proliferative response in sorted progenitor cells when compared with any of the rCSF-1 treatment groups, the addition of 10, 25, and 50 ng/ml rCSF-1 induced a proliferative response in progenitor cell cultures starting on day 4 post-addition of rCSF-1 (Fig. 5A). CSF-1 elution buffer (negative control) did not induce or inhibit the proliferative response in any of the experiments.FIGURE 5BrdUrd proliferation assay showing proliferation of sorted goldfish progenitor cells (A), monocytes (B), and macrophages (C) treated over 8 days with cell-conditioned medium, 10 ng/ml CSF-1, 10 ng/ml CSF-1 preincubated with 50 ng/ml sCSF-1R, or 50 ng/ml sCSF-1R alone. All data have the values collected for untreated cells subtracted from it to control for production of endogenous growth factors by the cells. Assays begin with seeding 10,000 cells per well in a final treatment volume of 100 μl. Statistical significance compared with CCM positive control values is denoted with an asterisk; bars represent S.E. Results are averages obtained from eight fish.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Preincubation of sCSF-1R with the rCSF-1 at a ratio of 50 ng/ml sCSF-1R to 10 ng/ml rCSF-1 abrogated the proliferative response observed in the sorted monocyte and macrophage populations compared with those treated with rCSF-1 alone (Fig. 5, A–C). Addition of the sCSF-1R to the cultures treated with CCM inhibited proliferation, however not to the extent seen in the rCSF-1-treated cultures. Treatment of sorted progenitor cells, monocytes, and macrophages with 50 ng/ml sCSF-1R alone had no significant effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 5, A–C).The proliferative response induced by rCSF-1 in sorted monocytes and macrophages was also inhibited by preincubation of the sorted cells by the affinity-purified rabbit anti-CSF-1R IgG, which recognized the first two extracellular Ig binding domains of the CSF-1R. The addition of 10, 50, 100, or 250 ng/ml anti-CSF-1R IgG to sorted progenitor cells (Fig. 6A) and monocyte (Fig. 6B), or macrophage cultures (Fig. 6C) for 2 h at room temperature before addition of ligand (rCSF-1) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. Maximal inhibition was observed after addition of 100 ng/ml anti-CSF-1R. Addition of 100 ng/ml anti-CSF-1R by itself to cells had no effect on cell proliferation when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6, A–C).FIGURE 6BrdUrd proliferation assay showing proliferation of sorted goldfish progenitor cells (A), monocytes (B), and macrophages (C) treated over 8 days with cell-conditioned medium, 10 ng/ml CSF-1, 10 ng/ml CSF-1 preincubated with 10, 50, or 100 ng/ml anti-CSF-1R antibody or 100 ng/ml anti-CSF-1R antibody alone.

Both SlyA and H-NS bind to multiple overlapping sites within the promoter in vitro, but their binding is not mutually exclusive, resulting in a remodeled nucleoprotein complex. In addition, we show that expression of the E. coli slyA gene is temperature-regulated, positively autoregulated, and independent of H-NS.

In addition, we show that expression of the E. coli slyA gene is temperature-regulated, positively autoregulated, and independent of H-NS. Extraintestinal isolates of Escherichia coli associated with disease often express high molecular weight acidic polysaccharide capsules, or K antigens, on their cell surface. Over 80 such K antigens have been identified, and these have been divided into four principal groups based on serological, biochemical, and genetic data (1Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The K5 polysaccharide is commonly associated with strains causing urinary tract infections and belongs to Group 2. These capsules resemble those possessed by Neisseria meningitidis and Hemophilus influenzae and are temperature-regulated, being expressed at 37 °C but not at 20 °C (2Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 39-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Temperature regulation of virulence factors is a common feature of bacterial pathogens, including Shigella, Yersinia, and Salmonella spp., and ensures that such factors are only expressed in appropriate environments (3Konkel M.E. Tilly K. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The K5 capsule gene cluster is composed of three principal regions. Region 2 is serotype-specific and contains the genes (kfiABCD) responsible for synthesis of the polysaccharide. Regions 1 (kpsFEDUCS) and 3(kpsMT) are conserved throughout Group 2 and consist of genes responsible for transport and assembly of the polysaccharide capsule (Fig. 1). Transcription is driven by two convergent temperature-regulated promoters located upstream of regions 1 and 3 (4Simpson D.A. Hammarton T.A.C. Roberts I.S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6466-6474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stevens M.P. Clarke B.R. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1001-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The region 3 promoter is located 741 base pairs 5′ of the first of two genes in region 3, kpsM, and transcription proceeds through region 2 with the aid of the transcription antitermination factor, RfaH (Fig. 1) (5Stevens M.P. Clarke B.R. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1001-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Stevens M.P. Hanfling P. Jann B. Jann K. Roberts I.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 124: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RfaH function is dependent on a short sequence present in the region 3 mRNA known as the JUMPStart sequence (7Hobbs M. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 855-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and it is also involved in the expression of E. coli Group 1 capsules (8Rahn A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1045-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The region 1 promoter (PR1) 3The abbreviations used are: PR1, region 1 promoter; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 3The abbreviations used are: PR1, region 1 promoter; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. is located 225 base pairs 5′ of the kpsF gene (4Simpson D.A. Hammarton T.A.C. Roberts I.S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6466-6474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription from this promoter proceeds past an intragenic Rho-dependent terminator in kpsF to yield an 8-kb polycistronic region 1 transcript that is later processed to yield a separate, kpsS-specific transcript (Fig. 1). Unlike the region 3 promoter, there is no dependence upon RfaH for transcription elongation at PR1 (4Simpson D.A. Hammarton T.A.C. Roberts I.S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6466-6474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IHF protein is required for maximum transcription from PR1 at 37 °C and binds to a single site located 130 bp 3′ to the transcription start point at PR1 (Fig. 1) (9Rowe S. Hodson N. Griffiths G. Roberts I.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2741-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Two additional regulators, H-NS and BipA, play an unusual dual role in the temperature regulation of transcription at this promoter; both are required for maximum transcription at 37 °C, yet both also contribute to repression of transcription at 20 °C (9Rowe S. Hodson N. Griffiths G. Roberts I.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2741-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). BipA is a ribosome-binding GTPase that is able to regulate gene expression at the level of translation (10Owens R.M. Pritchard G. Skipp P. Hodey M. Connell S.R. Nierhaus D. O'Connor C.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3375-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is required for the growth of E. coli at low temperature (11Pfennig P.L. Flower A.M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and regulates the expression of multiple pathogenicity islands in this bacterium (12Grant A.J. Farris M. Alefounder P. Williams P.H. Woodward M.J. O'Connor C.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of this protein in regulating transcription from PR1 is probably indirect. H-NS is a global regulator able to influence the expression of ∼5% of all genes in E. coli (13Hommais F. Krin E. Laurent-Winter C. Soutourina O. Malpertuy A. Le Caer J.P. Danchin A. Bertin P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and whose direct influence on transcription is almost universally negative, often regulating gene expression in response to environmental conditions including temperature and osmolarity (14Schroder O. Wagner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 945-960Google Scholar). Examples of direct activation of gene expression by H-NS are rare. In the case of the maltose regulon, H-NS has been shown to stimulate MalT translation (15Johannsson J. Dagberg B. Richet E. Uhlin B.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6117-6125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and H-NS plays a positive role in the activation of the traJ gene of pRK100 (16Starcic-Erjavec M. van Putten J.P.M. Gaastra W. Jordi B.J.A.M. Grabnar M. Zgur-Bertok D. Mol. Gen. Genomics. 2003; 270: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). H-NS binds to no specific target sequence in DNA but instead recognizes intrinsic DNA curvature with which it interacts (17Dorman C.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Recently, the principal role of H-NS has been proposed to be one of “xenogenic silencing,” preventing the expression of genes encoded on horizontally acquired DNA by recognizing abnormally high AT content, thus preventing any reduction in fitness that might be conferred by the invading DNA (18Navarre W.W. Porwollik S. Wang Y. McClelland M. Rosen H. Libby S.J. Fang F.C. Science. 2006; 313: 236-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Antirepressors, an example of which is the SlyA protein, can then alleviate such repression. SlyA was originally identified as a Salmonella typhimurium gene product able to induce a hemolytic phenotype upon E. coli K-12 (19Libby S.J. Goebel W. Ludwig A. Buchmeier N. Bowe F. Fang F.C.

Goebel W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has been shown to be essential for the virulence of S. typhimurium in mice, resistance to the oxidative burst, and survival within murine macrophages (19Libby S.J. Goebel W. Ludwig A. Buchmeier N.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17630-17637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). SlyA has since been characterized as a regulator of a variety of virulence factors in S. typhimurium, the majority of which occur in either the cell membrane or periplasm or are surface-exposed (23Navarre W.W. Halsey T.A. Walthers D. Frye J. McClelland M. Potter J.L. Kenney L.J. Gunn J.S. Fang F.C. Libby S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This led to the proposal that one of the principal functions of SlyA is to effect alterations in the bacterial cell surface with the ultimate aim of protecting it from host defense mechanisms (23Navarre W.W. Halsey T.A. Walthers D. Frye J. McClelland M. Potter J.L. Kenney L.J. Gunn J.S. Fang F.C. Libby S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, the SlyA homologue of Yersinia spp., RovA, has been shown to contribute to virulence in Yersinia, including a role in bubonic plague (24Ellison D.W. Miller V.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 25Cathelyn J.S. Crosby S.D. Lathem W.W. Goldman W.E. Miller V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13514-13519Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). RovA regulates the transcription of the outer membrane protein invasin in Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica (26Revell P.A. Miller V.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 27Nagel G. Lahrz A. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1249-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) through H-NS antirepression (28Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Ellison D.W. Miller V.L. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5101-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate the involvement of SlyA in the regulation of K5 capsule gene expression and show that H-NS and SlyA interact to promote transcription from PR1, in a novel manner that is different from that previously proposed for H-NS antirepression. In addition, we demonstrate that expression of the E. coli slyA gene is temperature-regulated, positively autoregulated, and independent of H-NS. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and DNA Fragments—The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Bacteria were routinely grown in LB medium at 37 or 20 °C, as indicated, and supplemented with antibiotics as appropriate at the following concentrations: 50 μgml–1 kanamycin, 50 μg ml–1 streptomycin, 12.5 μgml–1, and 100 μgml–1 ampicillin. X-gal was used at a concentration of 40 μgml–1. Strain HA1 was constructed as follows. A PCR-amplified fragment of PR1 stretching 870 bp 5′ to the start codon of kpsF was introduced into the lacZ reporter plasmid pRS415 (30Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N.

Open table in a new tab β-Galactosidase Assays—Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 into fresh, prewarmed LB plus antibiotics, and grown to an A600 of ∼0.4–0.6. Assays were performed as described (31Miller J.H. Miller J.H. E Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Protein Purification—The hns gene was cloned into plasmid pET22b to generate plasmid pET22b-H-NS expressing a C-terminally His6-tagged H-NS protein. The protein was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL-21 and purified essentially as described (32McNulty C. Thompson J. Barrett B. Lord L. Andersen C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 907-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Purification of H-NS was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (see supplemental Fig. S1). SlyA was purified as follows. The slyA structural gene was cloned into plasmid pGEX-6P-1 and expressed in strain E. coli BL-21, yielding a glutathione S-transferase-SlyA fusion protein. An overnight culture of BL-21pGST-SlyA was diluted 1:100 into fresh ampicillin-containing LB medium and grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking to A600 of ∼0.5. Expression of the glutathione S-transferase-SlyA fusion was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were incubated for a further 3 h at 25 °C before collection by centrifugation at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 8 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 20% glycerol and passaged twice through a French pressure cell. Clarified cell-free extracts were adsorbed onto a 1-ml Glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. The column was washed with 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and equilibrated with 10 ml of Pre-Scission protease buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8). The SlyA protein was cleaved from glutathione S-transferase by overnight digestion with 5 units of Pre-Scission protease (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C, and eluted in Pre-Scission protease buffer. In both cases, protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin standards. Purification of SlyA was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (see supplemental Fig. S1). EMSA—V1, V2, and V3 DNA fragments (10, 20, and 35 nm, respectively) were incubated with varying concentrations of purified SlyA, H-NS, or both, as indicated. A 200-bp fragment spanning the multiple cloning site of pBluescript (Stratagene) was amplified using M13 Forward primer (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) and M13 Reverse primer (5′-GGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′) and used as a negative control at a final concentration of 18 nm. The reaction buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9), 50 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in a final reaction volume of 10 μl. Samples were incubated at either 37 or 20 °C for 10 min before being mixed with 5× loading dye (Bioline) and resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 2% glycerol. Electrophoresis was performed in 1× TBE at 12 V cm–1 before staining in 0.5 μgml–1 ethidium bromide for 15 min. DNase I Footprinting—5 μg of plasmid pDC2B was digested with SpeI and HindIII, and the promoter fragment separated from the vector backbone on a 0.7% agarose gel, followed by purification using a Qiagen gel extraction kit according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. The purified fragment was labeled with Klenow enzyme and 20 μCi of [α-32P]dATP for 20 min at room temperature. Labeled DNA was purified using a Qiagen PCR cleanup kit, and a final concentration of 5 nm promoter fragment was incubated with varying concentrations of SlyA, H-NS, or both, in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9), 50 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, in a total volume of 50 μl. After a 10-min incubation, 50 μl of a 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2 solution was added to each sample before digesting with 0.14 units of DNase I for 3 min at room temperature. Digestion reactions were terminated by the addition of 90 μl of stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS) prewarmed to 37 °C. Digestion products were extracted with phenol-chloroform and ethanol-precipitated, followed by resuspension in 10 μl of formamide loading dye (1:2, 0.1 m NaOH/formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Resuspended samples were denatured by heating to 90 °C for 3 min followed by immersion in ice for 2 min, and 3 μl of each sample was loaded onto a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel for electrophoretic fractionation. Footprinting reactions were calibrated with Maxam and Gilbert G-tracks (33Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9012) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction—For RNA extraction, E. coli strains were cultivated in LB medium overnight at 37 °C before being inoculated into fresh LB medium (1:100) and grown at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. When the A600 reached 0.5, RNA was extracted from 24 ml of culture using the RNEasy Protect Bacteria Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop), where an A260 of 1.0 equals 40 μgml–1. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—An aliquot containing 100 ng of RNA was reverse-transcribed with Euroscript RT (Eurogentec) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions using specific reverse primers. Reverse-transcribed RNA samples were quantified using Eurogentec SYBR Green (Eurogentec) on the ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems), and the relative amounts of cDNA were determined using ABI Prism SDS software (Applied Biosystems). Relative standard curves were prepared from serially diluted PCR products, and 16 S rRNA was used as a control. The primer sequences were KpsEF (5′-GTGAAGTCTGCCGTATCCTGG-3′), KpsER (5′-CCAGAATGATGATTTTCGCCA-3′), 16SrRNAF (5′-CAGCTCGTGTCGTGAGATGT-3′), and 16SrRNAR (5′-CAGGTCATAAGGGGCATGAT-3′). Identification of SlyA as an Activator of Capsule Gene Transcription—To identify putative regulators of capsule gene transcription, a gene library of strain P90C was constructed by cloning a partial Sau3A digest of P90C chromosomal DNA into the multicopy vector pBluescript SK+. The library was introduced into strain HA1 that has a chromosomal PR1-lacZ fusion (Table 1), and clones harboring potential activators of capsule gene transcription were identified as dark blue colonies on media supplemented with X-gal. Analysis of the DNA sequences of candidate clones revealed the common presence of the transcriptional regulator slyA. One such clone, pRec5, was used in β-galactosidase assays, which showed that multicopy slyA enhanced in vivo transcription from PR1 (Table 2). To confirm that SlyA was involved in the regulation of capsule gene transcription, the slyA::kan mutation from strain MG1655slyA::kan was moved to HA1 by P1 transduction. Inactivation of slyA resulted in a 6-fold reduction in transcription from PR1 in β-galactosidase assays (Table 3). Complementation of the slyA::kan mutation with plasmid pACYC-SlyA confirmed that the slyA gene product was able to stimulate transcription at PR1, and significant activation of PR1 transcription was also observed in the HA1 parent strain containing plasmid pACYC-SlyA (Table 3). Additional evidence for the role of SlyA in capsule gene expression was obtained by directly measuring the transcription of kpsE, the second gene in the region 1 operon (Fig. 1), in the K5 strain MS101 and its slyA::amp derivative (Table 1). The presence of multicopy slyA in MS101 resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in yield of kpsE transcript, whereas inactivation of the slyA gene resulted in an ∼10-fold reduction of kpsE transcription relative to the wild-type (Table 4). Taken together, these data suggest that SlyA is required for and can promote transcription from PR1.TABLE 2SlyA is able to activate transcription from PR1 at 37 °CStrainβ-Galactosidase activityMiller unitsHA151.1 ± 3.6HA1 pBluescript45.7 ± 3.9HA1 pRec5120.7 ± 8.1 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Transcription from PR1 is dependent upon SlyA and H-NSStrainβ-Galactosidase activity37 °C20 °CMiller unitsHA161.3 ± 110.1 ± 0.3HA1 pACYC18459.9 ± 1.310.0 ± 0.5HA1 pACYC-SlyA155.3 ± 2.9118.2 ± 5.5HA1slyA::kan10.7 ± 0.75.2 ± 0.4HA1slyA::kan pACYC18417.2 ± 3.53.8 ± 0.4HA1slyA::kan pACYC-SlyA90.6 ± 3.965.4 ± 2.3HA1hns::kan29.7 ± 0.624.0 ± 1HA1hns::kan pACYC18432.3 ± 1.127.2 ± 0.4HA1hns::kan pACYC-SlyA44.7 ± 0.841.8 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab TABLE 4Transcription of kpsE in MS101 and MS101slyA::amp at 37 °CStrainKpsE transcription ± S.E.Ratiomolecules/μg total RNAMS1011.82 × 104 ± 3.70 × 101MS101pRec54.33 × 104 ± 1.90 × 1022.4MS101slyA::amp1.85 × 103 ± 3.30 × 1020.1 Open table in a new tab Interaction of SlyA with PR1—To demonstrate that SlyA interacts directly with PR1, competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed with increasing concentrations of purified SlyA protein and three PCR-generated promoter fragments spanning a region from 316 bp 5′ of the transcription start point to 218 bp 3′ of the transcription start point (Fig. 1). At 37 °C, SlyA specifically bound to the V1 fragment, spanning a region 5′ to the transcription start point, with 0.5–0.6 μm SlyA being sufficient to almost completely retard the mobility of the V1 fragment (Fig. 2A). At these concentrations, no binding was detectable to the V2, V3, or negative control fragments (Fig. 2A). This indicates that SlyA binds specifically to the V1 region of PR1. The Kd value for SlyA binding to V1 was determined to be 0.43 μm (data not shown). Comparison of the binding properties of SlyA at the capsule permissive temperature (Fig. 2A) with those performed at 20 °C (data not shown) revealed no significant difference in the DNA binding capability of SlyA at either temperature. The locations of the specific SlyA binding sites in the V1 fragment were determined using DNase I footprinting. This revealed two extended regions of DNase I protection (Fig. 2B), designated SlyA-I and SlyA-II, the second of which can be seen in more detail in Fig. 2C. Some binding to the SlyA-I site was still apparent in the presence of the nonspecific competitor heparin (100 μgml–1), whereas the addition of heparin eliminated binding at the SlyA-II site, suggesting that this may be a lower affinity binding site compared with SlyA-I (Fig. 2B). Role of H-NS in the Regulation of PR1—Previous studies have shown that H-NS plays an unusual role in regulating Group 2 capsule gene expression, appearing to maximize transcription from PR1 at 37 °C while repressing transcription at 20 °C (9Rowe S. Hodson N. Griffiths G. Roberts I.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2741-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence 5′ to the transcription start point of PR1 (to position –320) is 75% AT, and analysis of this region using Bend. It software (available on the World Wide Web) revealed four stretches of pronounced DNA curvature, each predicted to possess at least 8° curvature/10.5-bp helical turn of the DNA. These regions all corresponded to runs of A and T, the first three of which fell within the two characterized SlyA binding sites. Given that H-NS has a preference for binding intrinsically curved AT-rich DNA, we investigated whether H-NS acted directly or indirectly on the promoter using EMSA and DNase I footprinting analysis. At concentrations of 0.3–0.4 μm, H-NS was able to bind specifically to the promoter upstream fragment (V1) at 37 °C (Fig. 3A) with no detectable binding to fragments V2 and V3 at these H-NS concentrations (Fig. 3A). The Kd value for H-NS binding to V1 was determined to be 0.36 μm (data not shown). There was no difference in the binding of HNS to the V1 fragment at 20 °C (data not shown). H-NS protected extensive regions of PR1 in DNase I footprinting assays (Fig. 3B). The H-NS-I binding site extended outwards from a core region located between positions –187 and –208 upon increasing H-NS concentration and extended 5′ at least as far as –285 and thus overlapped the SlyA-I binding site (data not shown). The H-NS-III site extended across the transcript start point (Fig. 3B). Functional Interplay between H-NS and SlyA at PR1—The overlapping pattern of the binding sites was similar to that observed at other promoters regulated by SlyA and its Yersinia spp. homologue RovA, at which SlyA has been postulated to alleviate H-NS-mediated repression through competition for binding sites (28Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Wyborn N.R. Stapleton M.R. Norte V.A. Roberts R.E. Grafton J. Green J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1620-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the interplay between H-NS and SlyA at PR1 is clearly more complex, because despite being able to bind to the promoter, H-NS has no apparent repressive effect on transcription at 37 °C. In order to determine the functional significance of this interplay in vivo, β-galactosidase assays were performed on cultures of HA1 or its hns::kan derivative bearing single copy or multicopy SlyA. The results show that in the absence of H-NS at 37 °C, transcription from PR1 was reduced ∼50% relative to the wild-type (Table 3), confirming a positive role for H-NS in transcription from PR1 at 37 °C. Multicopy slyA (pACYC-SlyA) enhanced transcription from PR1 2.5-fold but in an H-NS-dependent manner; the level of transcription in the hns mutant grown under the same conditions increased only 1.5-fold and failed to reach the level observed in HA1. At the capsule nonpermissive temperature, the loss of H-NS resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in transcription from PR1, confirming a role for H-NS in the repression of capsule gene transcription at 20 °C. In the presence of multicopy slyA, transcription in the wild-type strain increased ∼12-fold at 20 °C. This effect was unexpected and not observed in the hns mutant under the same conditions, where only a modest (1.5-fold) increase in transcription was observed (Table 3). Therefore, it can be seen that the presence of H-NS was required for maximal SlyA promotion of transcription from PR1, indicating a functional interaction between H-NS and SlyA in the regulation of transcription from PR1. To investigate the relationship between H-NS and SlyA, competitive EMSA and DNase I footprinting analysis was performed in the presence of both proteins. EMSA analysis at 20 °C revealed that a concentration of 0.5 μm H-NS was able to form a stable H-NS·V1 complex, whereas 0.42 μm SlyA formed a less stable complex with a smeared appearance on the EMS"

Along with HDAC1, HDAC2 is found in the Sin3 and NuRD multiprotein complexes, which are recruited to promoters by DNA-binding proteins. In this study, we show that the majority of HDAC2 in human breast cancer cells is not phosphorylated. However, the minor population of HDAC2, preferentially cross-linked to DNA by cisplatin, is mono-, di-, or tri-phosphorylated. Furthermore, HDAC2 phosphorylation is required for formation of Sin3 and NuRD complexes and recruitment to promoters by transcription factors including p53, Rb, YY1, NF-κB, Sp1, and Sp3. Unmodified HDAC2 requires linker DNA to associate with chromatin but is not cross-linked to DNA by formaldehyde. We provide evidence that unmodified HDAC2 is associated with the coding region of transcribed genes, whereas phosphorylated HDAC2 is primarily recruited to promoters.

Histone-modifying enzymes and ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes affect gene expression by altering the compaction level of chromatin and the accessibility of DNA to binding proteins. Histone hyperacetylation is generally associated with chromatin decondensation and increased transcriptional activity, whereas histone hypoacetylation contributes to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression (1Wang X.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5420-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). HDAC1 and 2 belong to class I and are homologous to yeast RPD3. Both HDACs are core components of multi-protein corepressor complexes like Sin3 and NuRD, in which their activities are modulated through interactions with other proteins while being recruited by transcription factors to specific promoters (6De Ruijter A.J. Van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. Van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2494) Google Scholar). HDAC1 and 2 are phosphoproteins, and this post-translational modification enhances their enzymatic activity (7Pflum M.K. Tong J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol.

In studies with exogenously expressed tagged HDAC1 and 2, HDAC phosphorylation appeared to be a pre-requisite to form the corepressor complexes. However, studies characterizing endogenous HDAC corepressor complexes are lacking. The role of phosphorylation in the recruitment of HDAC2 by transcription factors has not yet been investigated. Several transcription factors repress gene expression by recruiting HDAC1/2 corepressor complexes to the promoters that they affect. Further, pending the promoter context, transcription factors recruit HDAC1 and 2 corepressor complexes to mediate dynamic deacetylation of histones and non-histone chromosomal proteins associated with or close to the promoter. We have previously reported that the Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors are associated with phosphorylated HDAC2 in breast cancer cells. Although most HDAC2 in breast cancer cells was not phosphorylated, it was the phosphorylated form of HDAC2 that was cross-linked to chromatin by the cross-linkers formaldehyde and cisplatin (9Sun J.M. Chen H.Y. Moniwa M. Litchfield D.W. Seto E. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35783-35786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These results suggested that it was the phosphorylated form of HDAC2 that was principally associated with chromatin, posing the question as to the role and location of unmodified HDAC2 in chromatin. In this study we determined which form of HDAC2 was recruited by a variety of transcription factors and which form of HDAC was associated with chromatin. Our results provide evidence that endogenous protein kinase CK2-phosphorylated HDAC2 is associated with the Sin3 and NuRD corepressor complexes and is recruited to promoters by a host of transcription factors. The more abundant unmodified HDAC2 requires linker DNA to associate with chromatin and locates to the coding region of transcribed genes.

The second step used the FLAG-HDAC2-M2 plasmids as templates with the primer pairs 3A, forward, 5′-GCTGTTCATGAAGACGCTGGAGATGAAGATGGAGAAGAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATCTTCTCCATCTTCATCTCCAGCGTCTTCATGAACAGC-3′; 3D, forward, 5′-GCTGTTCATGAAGACGATGGAGATGAAGATGGAGAAGAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATCTTCTCCATCTTCATCTCCATCGTCTTCATGAACAGC-3′; 3E, forward, 5′-GCTGTTCATGAAGACGAAGGAGATGAAGATGGAGAAGAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATCTTCTCCATCTTCATCTCCTTCGTCTTCATGAACAGC-3′ to produce a substitution of alanine, aspartic acid, or glutamic acid for serine in position 394, resulting in plasmids FLAG-HDAC2-M3A, FLAG-HDAC2-M3D, or FLAG-HDAC2-M3E, respectively. The constructed plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing (310 Genetic Analysis, ABI). Two μg of FLAG-HDAC2 or FLAG-HDAC2-M3 plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the supplier's instructions. Approximately 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation or storage at -80 °C. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—MCF-7 and HeLa cells were lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors, and immunoprecipitations were done as described previously (9Sun J.M.

For each cell lysate, an immunoprecipitation with preimmune serum was also performed as negative control to check for nonspecific immunoprecipitation. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described previously (12Samuel S.K. Spencer V.A. Bajno L. Sun J.M. Holth L.T. Oesterreich S. Davie J.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3004-3008PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against human HDAC1 (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), HDAC2 (Affinity BioReagents), Sp1 (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA), Sp3 (Upstate), Sin3A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), MBD3B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), Mi2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), RbAp48 (GeneTex Inc., San Antonio, TX), CK2α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), Rb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), YY1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), NF-κB p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), NF-κB p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and hyperacetylated H4 (Upstate) were used. For some of the immunoprecipitation experiments, antibodies were conjugated with CNBr-activated Sepharose (Sigma) following the supplier's instructions. Anti-FLAG M2 agarose affinity gel was obtained from Sigma. HDAC Activity Assay—HDAC activity assays were performed as described previously (13Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formaldehyde and Cisplatin DNA Cross-linking—Formaldehyde or cisplatin cross-linking was carried out as described previously (9Sun J.M. Chen H.Y. Moniwa M. Litchfield D.W. Seto E. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35783-35786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Spencer V.A. Davie J.R. The Protein Protocols Handbook. 2002; (Walker, J.

DNA-protein cross-links were reversed, and proteins were isolated. The proteins were either dialyzed against IP buffer for further immunoprecipitation or precleaned using the ReadyPrep two-dimensional clean-up kit (Bio-Rad) for further two-dimensional electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitation of DSP Cross-linked Proteins—DSP cross-linking was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Briefly, MCF-7 cells, grown to 80% confluence, were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 0, 5, 10, or 20 min with 1 mm DSP at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 10 mm and incubating the cells for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were lysed by sonication in low stringency buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Four A260 of cell lysate were incubated with anti-HDAC2, anti-HDAC1 or anti-RbAp48 antibodies. Immune complexes were recovered by adding protein A-Sepharose and washing three times with low stringency buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors, three times with high stringency buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors, and once with phosphate-buffered saline. The proteins were boiled for 5 min in SDS loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 5% (to reverse the DSP cross-linking), separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunochemically stained as indicated. Alkaline Phosphatase Digestion—Alkaline phosphatase digestion of cross-linked or immunoprecipitated proteins was done as described previously (9Sun J.M. Chen H.Y. Moniwa M. Litchfield D.W. Seto E. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35783-35786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Two dimensional electrophoresis was done as described previously (16Chen H.Y. Sun J.M. Hendzel M.J. Rattner J.B. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Samuel S.K. Minish T.M. Davie J.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 147-151PubMed Google Scholar, 18Spencer V.A. Samuel S. Davie J.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 288-292PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of cisplatin cross-linked proteins or total cell lysate from MCF-7 cells were loaded on isoelectric focusing strips (pH 3-10) and electrophoresed following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Isoelectric focusing strips were then transferred and electrophoresed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. After transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane, the proteins were immunochemically stained with anti-HDAC1 or anti-HDAC2 antibodies. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were done on MCF-7 cells as described previously with some modifications (19Spencer V.A. Sun J.M. Li L. Davie J.R. Methods. 2003; 31: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and were either subjected to dual cross-linking or treated with formaldehyde alone. The cells subjected to dual cross-linking were first incubated with 1 mm DSP or 1 mm ethylene glycolbis(succinimidylsuccinate) for 30 min at room temperature. Formaldehyde was then added to a final concentration of 1%, and the cells were incubated for 10 min. After quenching with glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm and lysis of the cells, the chromatin was sheared to an average fragment size of 500 base pairs, diluted to 4 A260 units/ml in dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and precleared by incubation with 60 μl/ml of protein A/G-agarose beads. Cross-linked chromatin fragments (1 ml) were incubated with 5 μg of anti-HDAC2 (Affinity BioReagents). Immunoprecipitated complexes were recovered by an incubation with protein A/G-agarose (pretreated with 500 μg/ml of yeast tRNA) and were serially washed with 1 ml of washing buffer I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, and 150 mm NaCl), washing buffer II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, and 500 mm NaCl), and washing buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1) and then washed twice with 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Precipitated chromatin complexes were eluted from the beads with 100 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). After reversal of the cross-linking at 65 °C, DNA was isolated directly from the agarose slurry using a QIAQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The ChIP and input DNA concentrations were determined with the Quant-iT Picogreen dsDNA kit (Invitrogen). Equal amounts (2 ng) of ChIP and input DNAs were quantitated by real time PCR, using the two following pairs of primers: pair 1; forward, 5′-GACGGAATGGGCTTCATGAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GATAACATTTGCCTAAGGAGG-3′ to amplify a 386-bp fragment in the promoter region of the TFF1 gene, and pair 2; forward, 5′-TTGTGGTTTTCCTGGTGTCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGAGGGACGTCGATGGTAT-3′ to amplify a 114-bp fragment in the TFF1 gene exon 2. The enrichment values (ChIP DNA versus input DNA) were calculated according to a published formula (20Ciccone D.N. Morshead K.B. Oettinger M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 334-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Chromatin Fractionation and Fraction Immunoprecipitation—Chicken immature erythrocyte salt-soluble chromatin S150 was prepared as described previously (10Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). S150 (200-300 A260 units) was loaded on a gel exclusion chromatography Bio-Gel A1.5m column (Bio-Rad) (10Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The fractions were collected and pooled. To check DNA size, 20 μl from each fraction were extracted with phenol/chloroform, electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and stained with ethidium bromide. To analyze HDAC2, 2 A260 from each fraction were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-HDAC2 antibodies. Native chromatin immunoprecipitation (N-ChIP) was carried out as described previously (21Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 A260 of polynucleosome fraction (F1) were incubated overnight with Sepharose-conjugated anti-hyperacetylated H4 antibodies (Upstate). N-ChIP or ChIP with formaldehyde cross-linking (X-ChIP) assays were carried out on fraction F2. Equal amounts of F2 (∼50 A260) were incubated at room temperature for 10 min with (X-ChIP) or without (N-ChIP) 1% formaldehyde. Then cross-linking was quenched by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m, and both F2 samples were dialyzed against dilution buffer (described above) and concentrated to about 8 A260/ml. Immunoprecipitation with anti-HDAC2 antibodies (Affinity BioReagents), DNA recovery, and quantitation were done as described above. For the N-ChIP samples, the beads were washed with wash buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm butyrate, and 0.1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride), wash buffer B (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm butyrate, and 0.1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride), and wash buffer C (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm butyrate, and 0.1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride). Incubation at 65 °C was omitted for N-ChIP samples. Equal amounts (1 ng) of ChIP and input DNAs were analyzed by real time PCR using forward 5′-GGTGTGCTGGGAGGAAGGA-3′ and reverse 5′-CCAAACCACAGCACTCTGCAT-3′ primers to amplify a 78-bp fragment in the promoter region of the βA-globin gene, forward 5′-CTGTGAAGAACCTGGACAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-AAGTTCTCGGGGTCCACATG-3′ primers to amplify a 88-bp fragment in the βA-globin coding region (exon 2), forward 5′-CGTGTGCAAAGGAAAAACAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CGCCCCGTACTGATTTGA-3′ primers to amplify a 112-bp fragment in the H2A.F promoter region, and forward 5′-CCCCACATCCACAAGTCTCT-3′ and reverse 5′-GGGGAACACAAAAGCCATAG-3′ primers to amplify a 174-bp fragment in the H2A.F coding region (exon 5). The enrichment values (ChIP DNA versus input DNA) were calculated as described above. HDAC2 Phosphorylated Forms—To assess the phosphorylation states of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in breast cancer MCF-7 cells, we conducted two-dimensional electrophoretic analyses of MCF-7 cell lysates. Fig. 1 (B and D) shows that HDAC1 and HDAC2 were both immunodetected as single spots, demonstrating that most of these proteins were not modified in MCF-7 cells. However, we had previously showed that phosphorylated HDAC2 was preferentially associated with the Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors and preferentially cross-linked to DNA (9Sun J.M. Chen H.Y. Moniwa M. Litchfield D.W. Seto E. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35783-35786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Sun J.M. Spencer V.A. Li L. Chen H.Y. Yu J. Davie J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 302: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, MCF-7 cells were incubated with cisplatin, which cross-links proteins directly to DNA but unlike formaldehyde, does not cross-link proteins with each other. The proteins cross-linked to nuclear DNA in situ were isolated by hydroxyapatite column chromatography and separated by two-dimensional PAGE. Fig. 1C shows that HDAC1 was again immunodetected as a single spot, demonstrating that most of the DNA-bound HDAC1 was in an unmodified form. This also indicates that the cisplatin cross-linking itself did not affect the electrophoretic behavior of HDAC proteins. In contrast, the population of HDAC2 that was cross-linked to DNA showed a marked enrichment in tri-, di-, and mono-phosphorylated forms (Fig. 1A). Digestion of the cisplatin cross-linked protein fraction with alkaline phosphatase resulted in the loss of the HDAC2 forms and the appearance of the parent form of HDAC2 (Fig. 1E), providing evidence that phosphorylation was the modification involved in the genesis of the HDAC2 forms. Transcription Factors Recruit the Phosphorylated HDAC2 Forms—We had previously reported that Sp1 and Sp3 preferentially associated with phosphorylated HDAC2 (9Sun J.M. Chen H.Y. Moniwa M. Litchfield D.W. Seto E. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35783-35786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rb, p53, YY1, and NF-κB (p50, p65 subunits) are transcription factors known to achieve transcription silencing or dynamic acetylation/deacetylation by recruiting HDAC1 and 2 to specific promoters via Sin3 and/or NuRD complexes (23Brehm A. Kouzarides T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 142-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L.

Lee Y.C. Cheong J. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12470-12474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine whether these transcription factors preferentially recruited phosphorylated HDAC2, we carried out immunoprecipitations of MCF-7 cell lysates with antibodies to these transcription factors. Total cell lysates and immunoprecipitated fractions were electrophoresed on a SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblot for HDAC1 and HDAC2. Fig. 2 shows that an HDAC2 form with reduced mobility on a SDS gel was preferentially associated with transcription factors p53, Rb, YY1, and the NF-κB subunits p50 and p65. Our previous studies with Sp1 and Sp3 showed that the reduced mobility of HDAC2 in this SDS gel system was due to phosphorylation as treatment of the immunoprecipitate with alkaline phosphatase resulted in the disappearance of the slow migrating form and appearance of the faster migrating parent band (9Sun J.M. Chen H.Y. Moniwa M. Litchfield D.W. Seto E. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35783-35786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Nonphosphorylated HDAC1 was found associated with all of these transcription factors. These results demonstrate that a multitude of transcription factors selectively recruit phosphorylated HDAC2 in situ. Several of the transcription factors recruit the corepressor complexes Sin3 and NuRD, which contain HDAC1 and 2 (24Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The association of phosphorylated HDAC2 with transcription factors such as p53 and Sp1 may reflect that phosphorylated HDAC2 is a component of the Sin3 and NuRD corepressor complexes. To determine the HDAC2 form associated with the endogenous Sin3 and NuRD corepressor complexes, we incubated a MCF-7 cell lysate with anti-Sin3A and anti-Mi2 antibodies and collected the immunoprecipitated and immunodepleted fractions. Fig. 3A shows that the phosphorylated forms of HDAC2 were highly enriched in the immunoprecipitated fractions with both antibodies. Nonphosphorylated HDAC1 and CK2 were also coimmunoprecipitated, confirming that these proteins are components of the Sin3 and NuRD complexes. A marked enrichment of phosphorylated HDAC2 was also observed in the MCF-7 cell immunoprecipitated fractions using antibodies against MBD3 from the NuRD complex and the histone-binding protein, RbAp48, present in both Sin3 and NuRD complexes (Fig. 3B). Nonphosphorylated HDAC1 was also part of the complexes immunoprecipitated by anti-MBD3 and anti-RbAp48 (Fig. 3B). Alkaline phosphatase treatment of the RbAp48 immunoprecipitated fraction from MCF-7 cells resulted in a faster electrophoretic migration of HDAC2, providing evidence that the reduced mobility of HDAC2 was due to phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3D shows that the preferential association of phosphorylated HDAC2 with the Sin3 and NuRD complexes was also found in HeLa cells. Indeed, MBD3 and Sin3A immunoprecipitated fractions were highly enriched in phosphorylated HDAC2. Our data support the idea that several transcription factors recruit either the Sin3 or NuRD corepressor complexes associated with phosphorylated HDAC2 and unmodified HDAC1. We had previously reported that the protein kinase CK2 was associated with HDAC1 and HDAC2 (9Sun J.M. Chen H.Y. Moniwa M. Litchfield D.W. Seto E. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35783-35786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here we tested whether CK2 was a component of the Sin3 and NuRD corepressor complexes. A MCF-7 cell lysate was incubated with anti-CK2α antibodies, and the immunoprecipitated fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Sin3A and anti-MBD3B antibodies. Fig. 4 shows that CK2 was a component of both complexes because it was bound to Sin3A from Sin3 and MBD3B from NuRD, as well as being bound to HDAC1 and HDAC2. On the other hand, HDAC3, which belongs to different complexes than HDAC1 and HDAC2, was not found associated with CK2 in MCF-7 cells. RbAp48 is a core component of both the Sin3 and NuRD corepressor complexes. To determine whether RbAp48 directly interacts with HDAC2 and HDAC1, MCF-7 cells were treated with DSP, a homobifunctional, thiol-cleavable, primary amine-reactive cross-linker, and the cross-linked proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysate with anti-HDAC2 or anti-HDAC1 antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were washed under stringent conditions to remove proteins that were not cross-linked to the immunoprecipitated protein, and the cross-linked proteins were identified by immunoblotting. Fig. 5A shows that in the absence of DSP incubation, HDAC2 was not associated with RbAp48 following the stringent washes of the immunoprecipitates. Following 5-min incubation with DSP, RbAp48 was cross-linked to HDAC2. HDAC2 crosslinked to the RbAp48 immunoprecipitated protein was primarily the slow migrating phosphorylated form (Fig. 5B). Longer cross-linking times were required to observe retention of RbAp48 in the HDAC1 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5C). These observations provide evidence that phosphorylated HDAC2 interacts directly with RbAp48. To find out the requirement of phosphorylation for binding of HDAC2 to RbAp48, we determined whether RbAp48 would associate with HDAC2 in which the three serine phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine or with a potential HDAC2 phosphomimic in which the serines were mutated to glutamic or aspartic acid. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with vectors expressing FLAG-HDAC2 fusion proteins, either the wild type HDAC2 or a triple mutant HDAC2 that had its three phosphorylation sites changed from serine to alanine (Fig. 6A). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG, and the immunoprecipitated fractions were tested by immunoblot analysis for the presence of the histone-binding protein RbAp48, the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3, and HDAC1. Fig. 6B shows that RbAp48, Sp1, and Sp3 were associated with the wild type HDAC2 construct. When the mutated form of HDAC2 was expressed, none of these three proteins were coimmunoprecipitated by FLAG. In contrast, HDAC1 was associated with mutant FLAG-HDAC2. It is possible that mutated HDAC2 was unable to bind to RbAp48, Sp1 or Sp3 because of a change of structure caused by the serine to alanine mutations rather than to the absence of phosphorylation. To test this possibility, the three phosphorylation sites were mutated from serine to aspartic or glutamic acid because these amino acids have been previously shown to mimic phosphorylated serine residues (7Pflum M.K.

https://openalex.org/W2153123369,"MDC1 (NFBD1), a mediator of the cellular response to DNA damage, plays an important role in checkpoint activation and DNA repair. Here we identified a cross-talk between the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation. We discovered that MDC1 binds the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls the cell cycle. The interaction is direct and is mediated by the tandem BRCA1 C-terminal domains of MDC1 and the C terminus of the Cdc27 (APC3) subunit of the APC/C. It requires the phosphorylation of Cdc27 and is enhanced after induction of DNA damage. We show that the tandem BRCA1 C-terminal domains of MDC1, known to directly bind the phosphorylated form of histone H2AX (γ-H2AX), also bind the APC/C by the same mechanism, as phosphopeptides that correspond to the C termini of γ-H2AX and Cdc27 competed with each other for the binding to MDC1. Our results reveal a link between the cellular response to DNA damage and cell cycle regulation, suggesting that MDC1, known to have a role in checkpoint regulation, executes part of this role by binding the APC/C.

The cellular response to DNA damage is crucial for protecting the cells from genomic crisis. DNA damage in the cell activates the DNA damage response, which includes activation of cell cycle checkpoints, repair of the damage, transcriptional regulation and, if damage is excessive or unrepairable, activation of apoptosis. Proteins involved in the DNA damage response include sensors that detect the damage, transducer kinases that signal to downstream effectors, and mediators that mediate the signal from the transducer kinases to the effectors that execute the response itself (1Motoyama N. Kim K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).MDC1 (also known as NFBD1) is a mediator of the DNA damage response, playing a role in the maintenance of BRCA1 and the Mre11·Rad50·Nbs1 complex at sites of damage, the activation of Chk1, BRCA1, and DNA-PKcs, and in DNA double-strand break repair. Furthermore, MDC1 is required for the establishment of the G2/M and intra-S phase DNA damage checkpoints, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation (2Goldberg M. Kim M. Falck J. D'Amours D.

Kim S.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). BRCT domains are found in many proteins that regulate the DNA damage response, and tandem BRCT domains (tBRCT domain) were demonstrated to be phosphoprotein binding modules (11Manke I.A. Kim D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 12Rodriguez M. Kim X. Chen J. Songyang Z. J. Biol.

Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The consensus phospho binding sequence for the tBRCT domain of MDC1 was determined by peptide library screening as pSI(E/V/D)(Y/F) (pS is phosphoserine) (12Rodriguez M. Kim X. Chen J. Songyang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52914-52918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Recently, the tBRCT domain of MDC1 was found to interact directly with the phosphorylated form of histone H2AX (γ-H2AX), and the consensus for the binding of the tBRCT domain of MDC1 was further studied and determined as pSX(E/I/V)Y-COOH, suggesting that the phospho-residue should be four amino acid residues before the C terminus of the protein (14Stucki M. Kim J.A. Mohammad D. Yaffe M.B. Smerdon S.J. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2005; 123: 1213-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar).MDC1 functions as an adaptor protein, recruiting different proteins that have a role in the DNA damage response to the transducer kinases and to sites of DNA damage and, thus, facilitating the signal transduction after DNA damage. Therefore, it is likely that MDC1 interacts with many proteins to execute its role in the DNA damage response. The mechanism(s) by which MDC1 carries out its role is not fully understood. Here we report that the tBRCT domain of MDC1 interacts directly and in a phospho-dependent manner with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C is an E3 ubiquitin ligase composed of at least 12 subunits. It is required for cell cycle control and is active from early mitosis through late G1. During this time the APC/C targets many critical regulators of the cell cycle for degradation and is essential for proper cell cycle progression (15Peters J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 16Castro A. Kim C. Vigneron S. Labbe J.C. Lorca T.

The APC/C acquires its substrate specificity via two co-activators, Cdc20 and Cdh1. Cdc20 is active during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, whereas Cdh1 is active during later stages of mitosis and G1 (18Geley S. Kim E. Gieffers C. Gannon J. Peters J.M. Hunt T. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We further show that the interaction between MDC1 and the APC/C is mediated by the Cdc27 (APC3) subunit of the APC/C and enhanced upon DNA damage induction. Our results propose a link between the cellular response to DNA damage and cell cycle regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FHA, GST-FHAm, and GST-tBRCT were previously described (2Goldberg M. Kim M. Falck J. D'Amours D. Rahman D. Pappin D. Bartek J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2003; 421: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). GST-BRCT1, GST-BRCT2, and GST-linker were created by amplifying the relevant fragments by PCR using GST-tBRCT as a template. PCR fragments were cloned into pGEX-4T-3. GST-tBRCTm (K1936M mutant) was generated from GST-tBRCT using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Hemagglutinin (HA) MDC1 was generated from the KIAA0170 cDNA cloned into pcDNA3 that contains a double HA tag (pcDNA3-HA). HA-tBRCTm (K1936M mutant) and HA-ΔBRCT were generated from HA-MDC1 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. HA-FHA and HA-tBRCT were generated by subcloning the FHA or tBRCT domains from GST-FHA or GST-tBRCT, respectively, into pcDNA3-HA. GST-tBRCT-53BP1 was received from A. J. Doherty (20Iwabuchi K.

Hoog (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). GFP-Cdc27-C and GFP-Cdc27ΔC, composed of amino acid residues 664-824 and 1-666, respectively, of Cdc27, were subcloned from GFP-Cdc27. S821A, S821D, T792A, S803A, and T814A mutants were generated from GFP-Cdc27 or GFP-Cdc27-C using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. All vectors were sequenced to verify proper cloning.Cell Culture, Extract Preparation, Protein Expression, and Purification—293T, MCF7, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (21Dignam J.D. Kim R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar), and high salt protein extracts were prepared according to Li et al. (22Li J. Kim B.L. Haire L.F. Goldberg M.

Extracts were prepared from undamaged cells, cells treated with different gray doses of ionizing radiation (IR; using Faxitron Cabinet X-Ray system, model RX-650, Faxitron X-Ray Corp.), cells treated with 50 J/m2 of ultraviolet (UV) light, or 100 μg/ml of the radiomimetic drug phleomycin. For phosphatase studies extracts (∼1 mg) were incubated with 400 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 2 mm Mn2+-only or 2 mm Mn2+ and 50 mm EDTA for 30 min at 30 °C before pulldown or immunoprecipitation (IP) assays were done. GST-fused recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences).Peptides—Peptides were synthesized and labeled as described (23Hayouka Z. Kim J. Levin A. Loya S. Lebendiker M. Veprintsev D. Kotler M. Hizi A. Loyter A. Friedler A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8316-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Phosphoserine was coupled manually to the peptides. Fmoc-Ser [PO(benzylester)OH]-OH (1.5 eq), hydroxybenzotriazole (1.5 eq), and diisopropylethylamine (1.5 eq) were dissolved in dibromomethane, O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium-hexafluoro-phosphate (1.5 eq) was added, and the solution was stirred for 15 min. The solution was added to the preloaded resin, warmed to 60 °C, and shaken overnight. The resin was washed with dibromomethane and loaded back onto the peptide synthesizer. Biotin or fluorescein labels were added to the N terminus of the peptides using the following procedures. For biotinylation, biotin (Sigma; 5 eq) was dissolved in dimethylformamide/Me2SO 1:1. PyBop (5 eq) and diisopropylethylamine (10 eq) were added, the activated biotin solution was added to the preloaded resin, and the mixture was shaken overnight. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide/Me2SO (1:1, 3 times) followed by dichloromethane (3 times) and methanol (3 times) and dried by vacuum. For fluorescein, peptides were labeled using 5′ (and 6′) carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) as described (23Hayouka Z. Kim J. Levin A. Loya S. Lebendiker M. Veprintsev D. Kotler M. Hizi A. Loyter A. Friedler A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8316-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Peptides used in this study were Cdc26 peptides (NNRSSQFGSLEF and NNRSSQFGpSLEF) and Cdc27 peptides (ADDTQLHAAESDEF and ADDTQLHAAEpSDEF). Biotinylated histone H2AX peptides (SGSTVGPKAPSGGKKATQASQEY and SGSTVGPKAPSGGKKATQApSQEY) were a kind gift of M. Stucki (University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland).Antibodies—The commercial antibodies used in this study were monoclonal anti-Cdc27 (BD Transduction Laboratories) and APC7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Anti-MDC1 antibodies included rabbit and sheep anti-MDC1 directed against the FHA and tBRCT domains of MDC1 (2Goldberg M. Kim M. Falck J. D'Amours D. Rahman D. Pappin D. Bartek J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2003; 421: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and mouse anti-MDC1, clone MDC1-50 (Sigma-Aldrich). Rabbit anti-Cdc16 (1443, a gift of P. Hieter, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada), monoclonal AF3.1 anti-Cdc27, and AR38 anti-Cdh1 (a gift from J. Gannon, Cancer Research UK, Clare Hall Laboratories, UK) antibodies were used. Also used as controls were sheep IgG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-Myc (9E10), and monoclonal anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Immunoprecipitation, GST, and Peptide Pulldown Assays—GST pulldown assays were done with bacterially expressed and purified indicated GST fusions and glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). IPs were done with the indicated antibodies and protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Roche Applied Science). Nuclear protein extracts (0.5-1 mg) or high salt protein extracts (1-2 mg) were added to the IP or GST pulldown assays. Peptide pulldown assays were done using 350 pmol of biotinylated peptides and 20 μg of purified GST-tBRCT in the presence of 20 μl of streptavidin-coated Dynabeads M-280 (Dynal). Beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl), and bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting.Identification of the Interaction between the tBRCT Domain of MDC1 and the APC/C—Proteins from 293T nuclear extracts that were retrieved by GST-tBRCT were separated by SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were stained first with PageBlue (Fermentas), and positive bands were cut from the gel. Positive bands included bands that appeared in the GST-tBRCT-plus extract reaction but not with GST-tBRCT without extract or with GST plus extract. The gel was re-stained with silver, and additional bands were cut from the gel. Protein analysis and identification of the different bands were carried out at The Smoler Proteomics Center (Technion, Haifa, Israel). Briefly, all samples were digested by trypsin, analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS on ion-trap mass spectrometers (DECA/LCQ) and identified by Pep-Miner software (24Beer I. Kim E. Ziv T. Admon A. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 950-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) against human nucleotide data base.Blot Overlay—Wild-type GFP-Cdc27-C or S821A was overexpressed in 293T cells, and protein extracts were prepared 1 h after exposure to 15 gray of IR. Equal amounts of extract were either resolved by SDS-PAGE or used for GST pulldown experiments with GST-tBRCT. GFP was visualized directly in-gel (samples were incubated with sample buffer at 37 °C for 5 min before SDS-PAGE and visualized using either FUJIFILM FLA-3000 or a FUJI LAS-3000 imaging system), and separated proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked overnight in 8% powder milk (Marvel) in TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with GST-tBRCT or GST-tBRCTm at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 4% powder milk in TBST. The membrane was rinsed with TBST and incubated with antibodies directed against the tBRCT domain of MDC1. The membrane was then washed in TBST and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Peroxidase activity was detected with the EZ-ECL chemiluminescence system (Biological Industries) and documented on a FUJI LAS-3000. GST pull down with λ phosphatase was performed as described above, with the exception that just before SDS-PAGE λ phosphatase (Upstate) was added to the glutathione beads and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C.Phosphorylation Analysis by Mass Spectrometry—Wild-type GFP-Cdc27-C was overexpressed in 293T cells, and protein extracts were prepared 1 h after the addition of phleomycin (100 μg/ml). The extract was used in a GST pulldown experiment with GST-tBRCT to enrich the phosphorylated form of GFP-Cdc27-C. After extensive washing, the beads were split into two tubes, and λ-phosphatase was added to one sample. Both samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, sample buffer was added, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. GFP was visualized directly in-gel, and both bands were excised for mass spectrometry analysis. Reduction, alkylation, and trypsinization steps were carried out in-gel as described (25Rosenfeld J. Kim J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Peptides were extracted from the gel with 60% CH3CN, 1% CHOOH, evaporated to dryness, rehydrated with 1 μl of CH3CN, 1% CHOOH, and then diluted with 9 μl of 1% Formic acid. The peptide mixture was solid phase-extracted with a C18 resin-filled tip (ZipTip Millipore, Billerica, MA) and nanosprayed into a Q-TOF-2 MS system (Micromass) in 50% CH3CN, 1% CHOOH solution using a nanospray attachment (26Wilm M. Kim M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). Data analysis was done using the Biolynx package (Micromass), and data base searches were performed with the Mascot package (Matrix Science). Peptides were positively identified by analysis of MS spectra and subsequent MS/MS spectra.Anion Exchange Chromatography—Protein extract from HeLa S3 cells either untreated or treated with 10 gray and left to recover for 1 h, was diluted 1:7 with buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl) and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose FF column. Bound proteins were eluted with buffer B (as buffer A except 1 m NaCl) with a two-step gradient (60 and 100%). Collected fractions were concentrated by acetone precipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.RESULTSThe tBRCT Domain of MDC1 Interacts with the APC/C—To gain further knowledge about the functions of MDC1, we set out to identify proteins that interact with the tBRCT domain of MDC1. We used the tBRCT domain of MDC1 fused to GST (GST-tBRCT) as an affinity matrix to purify proteins that associate with MDC1. Several proteins were retrieved, among them proteins with relative molecular masses of ∼240, ∼75, and ∼70 kDa. These bands did not appear in the controls, which included pulldown experiments of GST alone with extract and of purified GST-tBRCT without extract. Mass spectrometric analysis identified these proteins as APC1, APC5, and APC6 (Table 1), all of which are subunits of the APC/C (16Castro A. Kim C. Vigneron S. Labbe J.C. Lorca T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The apparent size, which was estimated by comparison to protein size marker, correlated well with actual molecular weights of these proteins (Table 1). Western blot analysis confirmed that GST-tBRCT efficiently retrieves the APC/C from protein extracts (Fig. 1A). Three different subunits of the APC/C, Cdc27, APC7, and Cdc16 (APC6), and one of the co-activators of the APC/C, Cdh1, which binds the APC/C from late-mitosis until the end of G1 (16Castro A. Kim C. Vigneron S. Labbe J.C. Lorca T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 17Wasch R. Kim D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), were retrieved by the tBRCT domain of MDC1 (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Notably, Cdh1 appears as two distinct bands in the input but only the faster migrating form is retrieved by the tBRCT domain of MDC1 (Fig. 1A). This is the unphosphorylated, active form of Cdh1 that binds the APC/C (27Listovsky T. Kim A. Laronne A. Brandeis M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Lukas C. Kim C.S. Kramer E. Santoni-Rugiu E. Lindeneg C. Peters J.M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 1999; 401: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that MDC1 interacts with active APC/C. These results were reproduced using extracts prepared from different cell lines (data not shown). The FHA domain of MDC1 or a mutated version of this domain fused to GST or GST alone did not retrieve the APC/C from protein extracts (Fig. 1A). In addition, the tBRCT domain of 53BP1, which, like MDC1, is a mediator of the DNA damage response, did not retrieve the APC/C from protein extracts (Fig. 2A), indicating that this interaction is specific to the tBRCT domain of MDC1.TABLE 1Identification of proteins that bind the tBRCT domain of MDC1 by mass spectometryPeptide massMatching peptideProteinObserved MrTheoretical MrDaKDa2288.1FSEQGGTPQNVATSSSLTAHLRAPC1240216931.5LILTGAESKAPC575851856.9LIEESCPQLANSVQIRAPC575851632.8QTAEETGLTPLETSRAPC67071 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2The phosphate binding pocket of MDC1 is required for its binding to the APC/C. A, the integrity of the tBRCT domain of MDC1 is required for the interaction with the APC/C. GST pulldown assays were performed with nuclear extracts from 293T cells and the tBRCT domain, the first (BRCT1) or second (BRCT2) BRCT repeat, or the linker region between them and in addition, with the tBRCT domain of 53BP1, all fused to GST. B, mutating the phosphate binding pocket of the tBRCT domain of MDC1 (K1936M, tBRCTm) abolishes its binding to the APC/C. GST pulldown assays were performed with GST-tBRCT or GST-tBRCTm together with nuclear extracts from 293T cells. Equal amounts of GST-tBRCT and GST-tBRCTm were bound to the beads, as determined from Western blotting against GST. C, the integrity of the tBRCT domain of MDC1 is required in vivo for the interaction with the APC/C. Protein extracts were prepared from 293T cells overexpressing HA-MDC1 (full-length, ΔtBRCT, or K1936M). The HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody. The background of IgG antibody heavy chain is marked with an asterisk. Bound proteins were visualized by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether MDC1 interacts with the APC/C in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. Polyclonal antibodies directed against different regions of MDC1 (the FHA and tBRCT domains) efficiently co-immunoprecipitated different subunits of the APC/C (Cdc27, Cdc16, and APC7) and the co-activator Cdh1 (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Notably, the antibodies directed against the FHA domain of MDC1 co-immunoprecipitated Cdc27 and Cdc16 more efficiently compared with the antibodies directed against its tBRCT domain (Fig. 1B, quantification). Because the tBRCT domain of MDC1 mediates the interaction with the APC/C and the antibodies used are polyclonal, it is likely that some of the anti-tBRCT antibodies interfere with the binding, whereas other antibodies in the sera do not, thus explaining the difference in co-IP efficiency. The interaction between MDC1 and the APC/C seems to be stable, since the APC/C stays bound to MDC1 at high salt concentrations (Fig. 1C).To verify that the interaction between MDC1 and the APC/C is also mediated in vivo by the tBRCT domain of MDC1, we overexpressed HA-tagged versions of the FHA and the tBRCT domains of MDC1 (HA-FHA and HA-tBRCT, respectively) in cells. Antibodies directed against HA were used to IP the different domains of MDC1 from extracts, and as shown in Fig. 1D, Cdc27 was co-immunoprecipitated only from the extract prepared from cells overexpressing HA-tBRCT. To examine whether the tBRCT domain of MDC1 is the only domain that mediates this interaction, we overexpressed full-length HA-tagged MDC1 or a tBRCT domain-deleted HA-MDC1 (ΔtBRCT) and performed co-IP experiments using antibodies directed against HA. Although Cdc27 and Cdc16 were successfully co-immunoprecipitated from extracts prepared from cells overexpressing full-length HA-MDC1, they did not co-IP with the tBRCT-deleted HA-MDC1 (Fig. 2C), indicating that the tBRCT domain of MDC1 is crucial for the APC/C binding in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that MDC1 interacts in vivo with the APC/C and that the tBRCT domain of MDC1 specifically and exclusively mediates the interaction.The Integrity of the Phospho Binding Pocket of the tBRCT Domain of MDC1 Is Required for Its Interaction with the APC/C—The tBRCT domain contains two BRCT repeats and a short linker sequence between them. To examine whether the entire tBRCT domain of MDC1 is required for the interaction with the APC/C or whether subparts of it are sufficient for mediating this interaction, we performed pulldown assays with the different components of the tBRCT domain of MDC1. Fig. 2A shows that only the full-length tBRCT domain retrieves Cdc27 from protein extracts.The tBRCT domain is a phospho binding module (11Manke I.A. Kim D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 12Rodriguez M. Kim X. Chen J. Songyang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52914-52918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We mutated one of the key residues of the phosphate binding pocket of the tBRCT domain of MDC1, lysine 1936 to methionine (K1936M, tBRCTm). This mutation is known to abolish the interaction between γ-H2AX and the tBRCT domain of MDC1 (14Stucki M. Kim J.A. Mohammad D. Yaffe M.B. Smerdon S.J. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2005; 123: 1213-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). GST-tBRCTm did not retrieve Cdc27 from nuclear extracts (Fig. 2B). Hence the phospho-binding ability of the tBRCT domain of MDC1 is required for the interaction.We analyzed whether this mutation has the same effect on full-length MDC1 in vivo. Cdc27 and Cdc16 were not co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against HA from extracts prepared from cells overexpressing an HA-tagged version of MDC1 with a point mutation in the tBRCT domain (K1936M), whereas they were co-immunoprecipitated using extracts prepared from cells overexpressing a wild-type version of HA-MDC1 (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that disrupting the phospho-specificity binding of the tBRCT domain of MDC1 eliminates the binding of the APC/C.The Interaction between MDC1 and the APC/C Is Phospho-dependent—Because tBRCT domains are modules that bind proteins in a phospho-specific manner (11Manke I.A. Kim D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 12Rodriguez M. Kim X. Chen J. Songyang Z. J. Biol.

Phosphatase treatment of protein extracts eliminated the ability of GST-tBRCT to retrieve the APC/C from extracts and of the APC/C to co-IP with MDC1. This effect was not observed when EDTA, which inhibits the phosphatase activity"
https://openalex.org/W1978586036,"The movement of signal transduction enzymes in and out of multi-protein complexes coordinates the spatial and temporal resolution of cellular events. Anchoring and scaffolding proteins are key to this process because they sequester protein kinases and phosphatases with a subset of their preferred substrates. The protein kinase A-anchoring family of proteins (AKAPs), which target the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and other enzymes to defined subcellular microenvironments, represent a well studied group of these signal-organizing molecules. In this report we demonstrate that the Rab27a GTPase effector protein MyRIP is a member of the AKAP family. The zebrafish homolog of MyRIP (Ze-AKAP2) was initially detected in a two-hybrid screen for AKAPs. A combination of biochemical, cell-based, and immunofluorescence approaches demonstrate that the mouse MyRIP ortholog targets the type II PKA holoenzyme via an atypical mechanism to a specific perinuclear region of insulin-secreting cells. Similar approaches show that MyRIP interacts with the Sec6 and Sec8 components of the exocyst complex, an evolutionarily conserved protein unit that controls protein trafficking and exocytosis. These data indicate that MyRIP functions as a scaffolding protein that links PKA to components of the exocytosis machinery. The movement of signal transduction enzymes in and out of multi-protein complexes coordinates the spatial and temporal resolution of cellular events. Anchoring and scaffolding proteins are key to this process because they sequester protein kinases and phosphatases with a subset of their preferred substrates. The protein kinase A-anchoring family of proteins (AKAPs), which target the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and other enzymes to defined subcellular microenvironments, represent a well studied group of these signal-organizing molecules.

When and where enzymes become active influences the cellular processes they control. As a result, sophisticated molecular mechanisms have evolved to manage the spatial and temporal synchronization of signal transduction pathways (1Pawson T. Nash P. Science. 2003; 300: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Scaffolding and anchoring proteins target protein kinases and phosphatases to subcellular environments where they control the phosphorylation state of neighboring substrates (2Inagaki N. Ito M.

The first AKAP was identified when it was demonstrated that type II PKA co-purified with microtubules and that the RII subunit bound to the microtubule-associated protein MAP2 (8Theurkauf W.E.

Many more of these RII-binding proteins have subsequently been detected by an overlay technique to screen nitrocellulose membranes of immobilized proteins using the purified RII subunit as a probe (9Lohmann S.M.

Two important principles have emerged from this work: AKAPs bind the R subunits through a common anchoring region (16Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G.

In this report we show that zebrafish and mammalian orthologs of the MyRIP (myosin Va-Rab27a-interacting protein) function as kinase A-anchoring proteins. Other studies reveal that MyRIP also interacts with the exocyst complex, an evolutionarily conserved octameric protein unit that is an integral element of the vesicle-docking machinery at sites of regulated and constitutive exocytosis (33Novick P.

Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The 48-h zebrafish cDNA HybriZAP-2.1 XR library (kindly provided by Dr. David Ransom) was excised and amplified as detailed by Stratagene. A two-hybrid screen as described by Hollenberg et al. (38Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) was initiated using 1-45 Rze (a murine PKA RII ortholog) fused to the LexA-binding domain in pLexA vector as bait (pLexA Rze 1-45). The bait plasmid was introduced into the L40 yeast strain to screen a total of 2 × 106 transformants to ensure complete coverage of the library. Two-hybrid interactions were first detected by growth of the L40 strain on SD lacking histidine and supplemented with 3 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. All positive clones were further screened for lacZ expression by filter lift assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The LEU2-marked library plasmid was rescued, amplified in bacteria, digested with a variety of enzymes, and classed according to restriction pattern. Representatives from each class were retransformed into L40 along with the pLexA Rze 1-45 plasmid. In every case, retransformation was accompanied by complementation of the strain to His prototrophy. Library plasmids were then sequenced to identify the RII-interacting protein. In total, seven unique genes were represented. Zebrafish Reverse Transcription-PCR and 5/3′-RACE—Total RNA was extracted from 24-, 48-, 72-, and 102-h zebrafish embryos using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and further purified using RNAeasy (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from total RNA using Oligotex (Qiagen) and was used as a template for synthesis of single strand 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE cDNA libraries using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences, Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocols. 3′- and 5′-RACE PCR was carried out using the Advantage-GC 2 PCR kit (BD Biosciences, Clontech). To clone the Rze, 3′-RACE was performed using nested primers 5′-GATCTCTGCACAACCCCTACTACTG-3′ and 5′-CACCATGAGTATTGAGATTCCAGTCGGG-3′, which were designed according to a murine PKA RII-like zebrafish EST sequence fw80b12.x1 (GenBank™ accession number BM317066). A 1.5-kb band was cloned into pENTER/SD/D (Invitrogen), and the resulting clone, Rze, was sequenced. The coding region is identical to a cDNA clone sequence (Gen-Bank™ accession number BC124725) that was submitted during the course of this study. Zebrafish Ze-AKAP2 was cloned by 5′-RACE using nested primers 5′-GATTTCTAAGTCTCGCTCAATCTCTGATTGTC-3′ and 5′-CCTGTTTCTTCTCGACCTGCATCTCG-3′, which were designed according to the 1551-bp fragment obtained in the two-hybrid screen. PCR products were cloned into pCRII-TOPO using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) for sequencing, and the resulting clone, Ze-AKAP2, was sequenced (GenBank™ accession number EF694835). Plasmids—Full-length MyRIP was PCR-amplified from a mouse cDNA library (BD Biosciences, Clontech) and cloned into pCRII-TOPO using primers 5′-CACCATGGGGGAAGCTGGACCTGTGGGG-3′ and 5′-TCAGTACATCACAGCTGACTCCAGATCAG-3′. For the mammalian expression constructs, full-length MyRIP was PCR-amplified and cloned directly into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) using the same primers as above. The MyRIP fragments were PCR-amplified and cloned into pENTR/SD/D-TOPO for use as an entry clone in the Gateway system (Invitrogen). MyRIP fragments (1-153, 1-300, 153-856, and 490-856) were shuttled from pENTR/SD/D-TOPO into pcDNA3.1/nV5-DEST, an N-terminal V5-tagged destination vector for mammalian expression according to the manufacturer's instructions. The remaining two MyRIP fragments (153-495 and 300-856) were PCR-amplified and cloned directly into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO. pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-mouse MyRIP V197P, I206P, I236P, and I245P were generated by site-directed mutagenesis as per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) using primers 5′-GGCTGTGGCCCTACGACCGGCGAGGCCATCG-3′, 5′-GAAGAGGCCATCGAGGAGGCCCCTTCCAAAGCGAATC-3′, 5′-GAGCTAACTGAGGAGCCGGCCGGCACCATCCTG-3′, 5′-CCATCCTGCAGAGGATTCCAAGAAAGCAGAAGG-3′, and their complements, respectively. pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-Human MyRIP-FLAG Δ194-210, MyRIP Δ233-248 and MyRIP Δ194-210 Δ233-248 were also generated by site-directed mutagenesis using primers 5′-GTGATGGACACCTTGGCTGTGGACATAGGGGACAGCCTG-3′, 5′-CGGGACCACAAGGAGGAGCTAAAGAGCAAAAGTGAGCAGCAAG-3′, and their complements, respectively. pcDNA3.1/V5-His-AKAP-IS-GFP, pcDNA3.1/V5-His-Scrambled AKAP-IS-GFP, and pFOX.CMV/hGH (hGH sequence under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter) were generated in previous studies (39Alto N.M.

Cell Culture and Transfections—The clonal β-cell line INS-1(832/13) (42Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) was cultured (passages 48-60) in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) that contained 11 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown in 10-cm tissue culture dishes at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and passaged every 5 days using 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. Transfections of INS-1 cells were performed on cells at 50-75% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection. HEK293 cells at 50-75% confluence were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection. Antibodies—The following primary antibodies were used in this study: monoclonal anti-V5 and anti-V5 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen), monoclonal anti-GFP (B2) and rabbit anti-PKA catalytic subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-Sec6 (Stressgen), mouse anti-RIIα, PKA catalytic subunit, and anti-Sec8 (BD Biosciences). For indirect immunocytochemistry of INS-1 cells, the primary antibodies used were mouse anti-PKA RII (BD Biosciences), guinea pig anti-insulin (Chemicon), mouse anti-Sec8 and anti-Sec6 (Stressgen), secondary antibodies were Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-guinea pig (Invitrogen and Molecular Probes). Generation of MyRIP Antisera—Antibodies to MyRIP were generated in two rabbits using recombinant His-tagged mouse MyRIP (110-305) as the immunogen (Rockland), resulting in two antibody preparations, 7445 and 7839. For affinity purification, glutathione S-transferase-tagged human MyRIP (amino acids 1-383) was immobilized on resin (Affi-Gel 15) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with MyRIP antiserum (7445). The affinity resin was washed with 20 ml of PBS and 30 ml of PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl. Bound antibodies were eluted with 10 ml of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5; 1-ml fractions were collected; and 50 μl of Tris, pH 9.5, was added to each fraction. Immunocytochemistry—INS-1(832/13) cells were cultured on glass coverslips coated with 0.2 mg/ml poly-l-lysine for 24 h. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated 20 min at room temperature. The cells were washed once in PBS and incubated in staining solution (0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1% fish gelatin (Sigma), 0.1% Triton in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody (polyclonal MyRIP, 1:100; monoclonal PKA RII, 1:500; monoclonal Sec8, 1:100; monoclonal Sec6, 1:400; and polyclonal insulin, 1:500) in staining solution was then added for 2 h at room temperature, and the cells were washed three times with PBS for 10 min each. The cells were then incubated with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies in the same manner. After three PBS washes, the cells were rinsed with water and mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Molecular Probes). AutoSpot Peptide Array and RII Overlay—Peptide arrays were synthesized on cellulose membranes with an Auto-Spot Robot ASP 222 (AbiMed) as described previously (44Tegge W.J. Frank R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar). RII overlays were performed using either [32P]Rze or murine [32P]RIIα as previously described (10Carr D.W. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 246-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and PKA Activity Assay—The cell extracts were prepared by washing cells with cold PBS and followed by scraping cells in 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitors (1 tablet/10 ml complete mini, EDTA free protease mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. 50 μl of prewashed protein G or A beads (50% slurry; Upstate) and 3 μg of antibody was added to the extract and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with 1 ml of lysis buffer, three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer plus 1 m NaCl, and once with 1 ml lysis buffer. PKA kinase assays were performed as previously described (45Corbin J.D. Reimann E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of endogenous MyRIP, cell extracts from 10 tissue culture dishes (10-cm) were prepared as described above and pooled. Immunoprecipitations of MyRIP using the anti-MyRIP polyclonal antibody were carried out as described above. hGH Secretion Assays—INS-1(832/13) cells in 10-cm dishes at 70% confluence were co-transfected with 60 nm MyRIP siRNA (Dharmacon Mouse MyRIP siGENOME Duplex) or 60 nm control siRNA (BLOCK IT Fluorescent oligonucleotide) and 10 μg of hGH-expressing vector (40Goldfine I.D.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were plated in 24-well plates at 3.5 × 105 cells/well. After 48 h, the cells were washed once with 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer Hepes buffer (KRBH; 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgSO4 (7H2O), 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 4.74 mm KCl, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2) supplemented with 2 mm glucose and preincubated for 1 h in 2 mm glucose KRBH at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were then incubated 1 h in 1 ml of either 2 mm glucose KRBH, 20 mm glucose KRBH, 20 mm glucose KRBH supplemented with 1 μm forskolin, 2 mm glucose KRBH supplemented with 1 mm IBMX, 20 mm glucose KRBH supplemented with 1 mm IBMX, or 20 mm glucose KRBH supplemented with 1 μm forskolin and 1 mm IBMX. Culture supernatants were collected, centrifuged 10 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C, and frozen at -80 °C until assayed for hGH. After collection of secretion samples, the cells were harvested in 2 m acetic acid containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin, subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to remove cell debris. Analysis of hGH content in secretion samples and cell homogenates was performed using hGH enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). The data are presented as ratios of secreted hGH to total hGH content/well. Characterization of Zebrafish AKAPs—AKAPs are often classified by their ability to bind the regulatory subunits of PKA in a solid phase assay known as the RII overlay (9Lohmann S.M. DeCamili P. Enig I. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6723-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Carr D.W. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 246-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine whether AKAPs were expressed in developing zebrafish, two-day old embryo extracts were separated on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and subjected to an overlay procedure using purified 32P-radiolabeled zebrafish regulatory subunit (Rze) as a probe. Several Rze-binding bands were detected that ranged in size from 60 to 200 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Mammalian AKAPs bind their R subunits through an amphipathic helix (16Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These protein-protein interactions can be blocked with anchoring inhibitor peptides that compete for binding with the R subunit (39Alto N.M. Soderling S.H. Hoshi N. Langeberg L.K. Fayos R. Jennings P.A. Scott J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4445-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 46Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation with the anchoring inhibitor peptide, AKAP-IS, blocked Rze interaction with zebrafish AKAPs (Fig. 1A, lane 2). In contrast, preincubation with a control peptide (scrambled AKAP-IS) had no effect on the Rze/AKAP interactions (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Collectively, these results suggest that zebrafish express AKAPs and that the topology of the Rze/anchoring protein interface is similar to its mammalian counterparts. This latter view is also substantiated by evidence that zebrafish Rze is 71% identical to its mouse RII ortholog (Fig. 1B and Ref. 47Scott J.D. Zoller M.J. Glaccum M.B. Uhler M.D. Helfman D.M.

Biochemical and structural studies have defined the first 45 amino acids of RII as a docking and dimerization domain that forms the AKAP-binding site (18Gold M.G. Lygren B. Dokurno P. Hoshi N.

The corresponding region in Rze was used as bait to screen a zebrafish two-day-old embryonic cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1B, inset). Of the 1.9 × 106 transformants screened, 393 candidates activated both the lacZ and HIS reporters. In total, seven unique genes were represented (Fig. 1C). Two of these, Ze-Mtg8 and Ze-D-AKAP2, have mammalian homologs previously characterized as AKAPs (Fig. 1C and Refs. 50Fukuyama T. Sueoka E. Sugio Y. Otsuka T. Niho Y. Akagi K. Kozu T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6225-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar and 51Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11184-11189Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The remaining five genes were named Ze-AKAP1-5 (zebrafish AKAP). Bacterially expressed protein fragments of each putative Ze-AKAP were screened for RII binding using the overlay assay. Five of the seven candidate proteins bound Rze (Fig. 1D, top panel). Control experiments confirmed that Rze binding was blocked upon preincubation with AKAP-IS (Fig. 1D, top and middle panels), whereas the addition of a scrambled peptide control did not affect the interaction with Rze (data not shown). Approximately equal amounts of each bacterially purified zebrafish protein were used in the overlay (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). We chose to concentrate on a 517-amino acid fragment named Ze-AKAP2. Full-length Ze-AKAP2 was cloned from a zebrafish cDNA library by 5′-RACE. This cDNA encodes a protein of 856 amino acids that shares 35% identity with a human GTPase effector protein known as MyRIP (Ref. 52El-Amraoui A. Schonn J.S. Kussel-Andermann P. Blanchard S. Desnos C. Henry J.P. Wolfrum U. Darchen F. Petit C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and Fig. 1E). Most of the sequence homology lies in the N-terminal quarter of these proteins. The first 150 residues encompass a domain that binds to the GTPase Rab27a. This region is followed by two conserved sequences with similarity to PKA-anchoring sites on known AKAPs (Fig. 1E). A series of experiments confirmed that recombinant full-length Ze-AKAP2 functioned as an AKAP inside cells; however, when the Ze-AKAP2 gene expression was targeted for morpholino-mediated antisense knockdown, the modified zebrafish exhibited no obvious phenotype (data not shown). There are several possible explanations for this result, including the possibility that the presence of another gene compensates for the loss of Ze-AKAP2, or this anchoring protein may not play a role in early zebrafish development. Because we saw no obvious phenotype in zebrafish, we subsequently focused on the role of MyRIP as an anchoring protein in mammalian cells. Characterization of Mouse MyRIP as an AKAP—On the basis of protein sequence homology to Ze-AKAP2, we predicted that mouse MyRIP might be a PKA-anchoring protein (Fig. 1E). To test this hypothesis, a full-length mouse-coding region was cloned from a brain cDNA library by PCR, and a plasmid encoding V5-tagged MyRIP was transfected into HEK293 cells. Immune complexes were isolated using an antibody to the V5 epitope. Recombinant MyRIP interacted with PKA as assessed by RII overlay assay (Fig. 2A, top panel, lane 3). The addition of AKAP-IS blocked the RII/MyRIP interaction (Fig. 2A, middle panel, lane 3). Control immunoblots demonstrated that equal levels of each protein were expressed in the cell extracts (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Other controls confirmed equal loading of proteins in each lane and that preincubation with a scrambled peptide control had no affect on the interaction with RII (data not shown). This result implies that MyRIP binds to RII in a manner similar to other known AKAPs. To further resolve the MyRIP/PKA interaction inside cells, a plasmid encoding V5-tagged MyRIP was transfected into HEK293 cells. V5 immune complexes were isolated, and co-precipitation of PKA was assessed by immunoblot using a polyclonal antibody"

Animal cysteine-rich proteins and their plant counterparts are two LIM domain-containing proteins that were recently suggested to define a new family of actin cytoskeleton regulators involved in actin filament bundling. We here identified the LIM domains as responsible for F-actin binding and bundling activities of the tobacco WLIM1. The deletion of one of the two LIM domains reduced significantly, but did not entirely abolish, the ability of WLIM1 to bind actin filaments. Individual LIM domains were found to interact directly with actin filaments, although with a reduced affinity compared with the native protein. Variants lacking the C-terminal or the inter-LIM domain were only weakly affected in their F-actin stabilizing and bundling activities and trigger the formation of thick cables containing tightly packed actin filaments as does the native protein. In contrast, the deletion of one of the two LIM domains negatively impacted both activities and resulted in the formation of thinner and wavier cables. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the LIM domains of WLIM1 are new autonomous actin binding and bundling modules that cooperate to confer WLIM1 high actin binding and bundling activities.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that the LIM domains of WLIM1 are new autonomous actin binding and bundling modules that cooperate to confer WLIM1 high actin binding and bundling activities. Not only is actin one of the most abundant and conserved proteins in eukaryotes, it also plays a central role in diverse physiological processes such as cell division, adhesion and motility, muscle contraction, organelle and vesicle trafficking, and cytoplasmic streaming. Within the cytoplasm, monomeric globular actin (G-actin) assembles into actin filaments (F-actin) that constitute the basic functional elements of the actin cytoskeleton. Depending on cellular requirements, they elongate or depolymerize, form fine networks, or assemble into more rigid cables also called actin bundles. The plasticity and dynamic nature of the actin cytoskeleton are dictated by the multiplicity of its functions, and rely on a complex regulation system orchestrated by hordes of regulators, namely the actin-binding proteins (ABPs). 2The abbreviations used are: ABP, actin-binding protein; CRP, cysteine-rich protein; LIM, LIM domain-containing protein; ABD, actin-binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IL, interLIM domain; CT, C-terminal domain; CH, calponin homology. ABPs bind directly to G-actin and/or actin filaments to promote actin filament nucleation, polymerization/depolymerization, severing, stabilization, capping, as well as the assembly of actin networks and bundles (1Staiger C.J. Blanchoin L. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Winder S.J. Ayscough K.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In animal cells, actin bundles provide mechanical support to the cytoplasm and reinforce cellular protrusions and invaginations. Consequently they play particularly important roles during cell morphogenesis, division, adhesion, motility, and signaling. In plant cells, actin bundles serve as tracks for intracellular transport and confer stability to transvacuolar strands (3Shimmen T. Hamatani M. Saito S. Yokota E. Mimura T. Fusetani N. Karaki H. Protoplasma. 1995; 185: 188-193Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Shimmen T. Yokota E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 5Staiger C.J. Yuan M.

Shimmen T. Planta. 2000; 210: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, the defects in actin cytoskeleton organization observed in plant mutants impaired in trichome morphogenesis or in root cell expansion strongly suggest that actin bundles are also required for proper cell elongation and morphogenesis (7Baluska F. Busti E. Dolfini S. Gavazzi G. Volkmann D. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 478-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8El-Din El-Assal S. Le J. Basu D. Mallery E.L. Szymanski D.B.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1341-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The assembly of actin filaments into higher order F-actin structures is driven by a subset of ABPs called actin cross-linkers or bundlers. The latter usually display a modular organization comprising two actin-binding domains (ABDs), variable spacer domains, and regulatory domains that confer sensitivity to stimuli such as modifications in the calcium concentration (10Bartles J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 11Furukawa R. Fechheimer M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 175: 29-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Matsudaira P.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The length of the spacer domain that separates the ABDs is a critical determinant of the nature of higher order structures induced, i.e. tightly packed bundles or loose assemblies. Depending on the type of ABD present in their amino acid sequence, ABPs can be classified into different families. As an example, members of the spectrin family, including α-actinin, β-spectrin, utrophin, dystrophin, and fimbrin, use pairs of calponin homology (CH) domains as ABD (14Gimona M. Djinovic-Carugo K. Kranewitter W.J. Winder S.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the case of fimbrin, two pairs of calponin homology domains are arranged in tandem on the same polypeptide chain without any spacer, directing the formation of tightly packed bundles. In contrast, other cross-linkers such as α-actinin and β-spectrin require protein homodimerization to achieve a bivalent organization that supports the cross-linking of adjacent actin filaments. In animal cells, a multitude of actin-bundling proteins has been identified and characterized. During the last few years it has become clear that all bundles are not functionally equivalent and that cells utilize different combinations and sequences of actin bundling proteins to build the adapted actin structures with specific properties (10Bartles J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The deciphering of the cooperative action of actin cross-linking proteins, such as α-actinin and fascin, has highlighted the evolutionary benefit conferred by the existence of multiple actin cross-linking proteins with overlapping but non-identical biochemical properties (15Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Tseng Y. Kole T.P. Lee J.S. Fedorov E. Almo S.C. Schafer B.W. Wirtz D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In comparison, rather little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying actin bundle regulation in plants. However, substantial progress has been achieved through the characterization of important plant actin-bundling protein families including villins (17Klahre U. Friederich E. Kost B. Louvard D.

Plant J. 2000; 24: 625-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kovar D.R. Gibbon B.C. McCurdy D.W. Staiger C.J. Planta. 2001; 213: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and formins (22Cheung A.Y. Wu H.M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 23Michelot A. Guerin C. Huang S. Ingouff M. Richard S. Rodiuc N. Staiger C.J. Blanchoin L. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2296-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We recently suggested the existence of an additional family, namely the plant LIM domain-containing (LIM) protein family (24Thomas C. Hoffmann C. Dieterle M. Van Troys M. Ampe C. Steinmetz A. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2194-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Thomas C. Hoffmann C. Gatti S. Steinmetz A. Plant Signal. Behav. 2007; 2: 101-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The LIM domain is a tandem zinc finger structure of ∼55 amino acids that is found in numerous eukaryotic proteins. It functions as a modular protein binding interface that targets proteins to subcellular locations and triggers the assembly of protein complexes. Through interaction with protein partners, LIM proteins participate in diverse biological processes including the regulation of gene expression and cytoskeleton organization. Animal proteins contain 1 to 5 LIM domains, which can be associated with other domains such as homeodomains, kinase domains, or other protein-binding modules. The tobacco WLIM1 protein contains two LIM domains as only defined domains and is structurally related to the vertebrate cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family, which comprises the three proteins CRP1, CRP2, and CRP3 (also called muscle LIM protein). WLIM1 binds directly to actin filaments with a high affinity and protects them from depolymerization (24Thomas C. Hoffmann C. Dieterle M. Van Troys M. Ampe C. Steinmetz A. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2194-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, it triggers the formation of thick actin cables both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that it participates in the regulation of actin bundling in plants. Like their plant counterparts, vertebrate CRPs exhibit a dual cellular localization (26Arber S. Caroni P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). They accumulate in both the nucleus and cytoplasm where they interact with the actin cytoskeleton. The nuclear functions of CRPs have been studied over the past two decades and it is now well established that this subset of LIM proteins are important regulators of cell differentiation and transcription (27Chang D.F. Belaguli N.S. Iyer D. Roberts W.B. Wu S.P. Dong X.R. Marx J.G. Moore M.S. Beckerle M.C. Majesky M.W. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 28Weiskirchen R. Gunther K. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, their actin cytoskeleton-related roles have remained obscure over a long period. CRPs were first believed to interact with actin filaments in an indirect manner through the intermediation of ABP partners such as α-actinin or zyxin (29Louis H.A. Pino J.D. Schmeichel K.L. Pomies P. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27484-27491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 30Pomies P. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Sadler I. Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, in agreement with our data on tobacco WLIM1, it has been recently demonstrated that CRP1 and CRP2 have the ability to interact with the actin filaments in a direct manner (32Grubinger M. Gimona M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Tran T.C. Singleton C. Fraley T.S. Greenwood J.A. BMC Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Importantly, CRP1 has been shown to induce actin filament bundling in vitro as well as in transformed rat embryonic fibroblasts (33Tran T.C. Singleton C. Fraley T.S. Greenwood J.A. BMC Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Together, these data strongly suggest that animal CRPs and plant CRP-related LIM proteins participate in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton architecture. Understanding the mechanism of actin filament stabilization and bundling triggered by WLIM1 and animal CRPs requires in the first instance the identification of the actin-binding domains. To date, none of the ABD sequences registered in data bases are present in plant LIM or animal CRP proteins. Here, we conducted a detailed domain analysis aimed at identifying the domain(s) implicated in the actin-related activities displayed by the tobacco WLIM1 protein. Two domains were found to have autonomous actin binding, stabilizing, and, more surprisingly actin bundling, activities: the LIM domains. Generation of Plasmid Constructs—The plasmids used for the transient transformation of BY2 cells are derived from an in-house-constructed group of plasmids (pNTL2103 and pNTL3103) produced by the assembly of the regulatory regions (35S promoter and nos terminator) and the fused coding sequences of GFP and tobacco WLIM1 in a derivate of pBluescript II KS (Stratagene). The pNTL2103 and pNTL3103 plasmids differ merely by the nature of the fusion in that the former produces the N-terminal GFP fusion and the latter the C-terminal GFP fusion. In both cases, the WLIM1-coding cDNA fragment is located between the NcoI and BamHI restriction sites. cDNA fragments corresponding to the C-terminal domain-deleted WLIM1 variant (WLIM1ΔCt) and to the N-terminal and C-terminal single LIM domains (LIM1 and LIM2, respectively) were generated by PCR using primers containing NcoI and BamHI restriction sites. They were inserted into the pNTL2103 and pNTL3103 plasmids from which the original full-length WLIM1 cDNA has been previously removed. The other WLIM1 variants containing an internal sequence deletion, i.e. deletion of the N-terminal LIM domain, the interLIM spacer, or the C-terminal LIM domain (respectively, named WLIM1ΔLIM1, WLIM1ΔIL, and WLIM1ΔLIM2) have been produced using the PCR-based QuikChange method (Stratagene). All primer sequences are available upon request. For synthesis of the His6-tagged proteins, the coding sequences of WLIM1 and WLIM1 variants were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE-60 (Qiagen) using the NcoI and BamHI sites. BY-2 Transient Expression and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy Observations—GFP fusion proteins were transiently expressed in BY-2 tobacco suspension cells (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Bright Yellow 2) were maintained as described (34Banjoko A. Trelease R.N. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured every 7 days and harvested 3 days after medium renewal for biolistic bombardment. The harvested cells were filtered onto Whatman discs and placed on 0.8% agar Murashige-Skoog media plates supplemented with 0.25 m mannitol for 2–4 h. Particle preparation and biolistic assays were performed as described (35Hunold R. Burrus M. Bronner R. Duret J.P. Hahne G. Plant Sci. 1995; 105: 95-109Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 4 mg of 1.1-μm tungsten particles (Bio-Rad) were sterilized in 1 ml of absolute alcohol for 20 min. Particles were then mixed with 10 μg of plasmid DNA supplemented with 18% glycerol, 1.5 m CaCl2, and 90 mm spermidine in a final volume of 180 μl. The firing distance was 11 cm and helium pressure 7 bars. After bombardment, cells were transferred to 0.8% agar Murashige-Skoog media plates and incubated in the dark for 16 h at 28 °C. BY-2 transfected cells were collected under a HBO binocular microscope (excitation/emission wavelength 488/505–545 nm) 16 h post-bombardment and cultured in Murashige-Skoog liquid media prior to confocal laser scanning microscopy observations. GFP fluorescence in transfected BY-2 cells was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy with a LSM510 Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (Jena, Germany) equipped with a C-Aprochromat ×63, 1.2 water-immersion objective. For each construct, experiments were reproduced at least three times and 50 GFP-expressing BY-2 cells were observed in each case. Laser scanning was performed using excitation/emission wavelengths (488/505–530 nm). Image processing was carried out with LSM510 version 3.2 (Zeiss) and Photoshop 6.0 (final image assembly; Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Expression and Analysis of Recombinant Proteins—His6-tagged proteins were expressed in M15 bacteria and purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetate resin (Qiagen) following procedures described by the manufacturer. The purified proteins were concentrated in a centrifugal filter (Amicon), buffer-exchanged (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0) using a 10 K molecular weight cut-off dialysis cassette (Pierce), and stored on ice. Prior to an experiment, proteins were pre-clarified at 150,000 × g, checked for correct mass by SDS-PAGE analysis, and their concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. High-speed and Low-speed Cosedimentation Assays—High- and low-speed assays were, respectively, used to examine the actin binding and cross-linking properties of WLIM1 and its variants. Rabbit muscle actin (Cytoskeleton) was diluted at 2 mg/ml in A-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Polymerization was induced by the addition of actin polymerization inducer (final concentration of 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 50 mm KCl). Recombinant proteins were pre-clarified at 150,000 × g prior to an experiment. In high-speed experiments, F-actin (8 μm) was incubated with different amounts of WLIM1 or WLIM1-derived peptides ranging from 0.5 to 48 μm (up to 72 μm for WLIM1ΔLIM1 and LIM2) for 30 min at 25 °C and subsequently pelleted at 200,000 × g for 45 min in an Optima TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman) at 4 °C. After the supernatant was removed, an identical volume of protein sample buffer was added to the pellet. Equal amounts of pellet and supernatant samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (Sigma) staining. The amount of protein in the pellets (actin-bound) or supernatants (unbound) was quantified using ImageJ version 1.37b software (National Institutes of Health). Dissociation constants (Kd) were determined as previously described (24Thomas C. Hoffmann C. Dieterle M. Van Troys M. Ampe C. Steinmetz A. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2194-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) by fitting the data of bound protein versus unbound protein to a hyperbolic function with Sigmaplot version 10 software (Systat Software). A mean Kd (±S.D.) value was calculated for each protein from three independent experiments. In low-speed cosedimentation assays, actin (8 μm) was copolymerized with different amounts of WLIM1 or WLIM1-derived peptides (1–24 μm) for 1 h at 25 °C, subsequently centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 30 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as previously described. After quantification, results were expressed as percentage of actin in the pellet as a function of WLIM1 or WLIM1-derived peptide concentration. The presence or absence of actin bundles was checked by direct visualization using fluorescence microscopy. An aliquot of the copolymerized actin samples was labeled with 4 μm rhodamine-phalloidin (Sigma). 1 μl of sample was diluted in one drop of cityfluor (Agar Scientific, UK) and applied to a coverslip coated with poly-l-lysine (0.01%). Images were recorded with our Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Jena) using a pinhole set to produce optical sections ∼2-μm thick. F-actin Depolymerization Assays—Pyrene-labeled actin (4 μm, 25% pyrene labeled) was polymerized at room temperature by a 30-min incubation in F-buffer (0.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) in the absence or presence of different amounts of WLIM1 or WLIM1-derived peptides (ranging from 2 to 24 μm). To induce depolymerization, F-actin was diluted in F-buffer to a final concentration of 0.4 μm. When specified under “Results,” cofilin (2 μm) was added to the dilution buffer. The fluorescence decrease was recorded over the course of 300 or 400 s using an F-4500 fluorimeter (Hitachi; excitation at 365 nm and emission at 388 nm). Electron Microscopy—Actin (4 μm) was copolymerized with WLIM1 or WLIM1 variants as previously described for low-speed cosedimentation assays. The mixture was applied to a carbon-coated nickel grid. Actin-filament bundles were allowed to adhere to the carbon film during a few seconds and stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate prior to examination with an electron microscope (Hitachi H600). Generation of GFP-fused and His6-tagged Recombinant WLIM1 and WLIM1 Variants—The tobacco WLIM1 protein is a 193-amino acid protein that comprises a short N-terminal domain (9 amino acids), two LIM domains (LIM1, LIM2, 52 amino acids each) that share about 43% identities, an interLIM spacer (IL, 48 amino acids), and a C-terminal domain (Ct, 32 amino acids). To better characterize the mechanism of action of WLIM1 and define the critical domains conferring the protein F-actin binding, stabilizing, and bundling activities, we generated four deletion variants (WLIM1ΔLIM1, WLIM1ΔIL, WLIM1ΔLIM2, and WLIM1ΔCt) as well as two single LIM domains (LIM1 and LIM2). The domain topology of WLIM1 and of the derived peptides is shown in Fig. 1A. To study their binding properties in the cellular environment, these peptides were fused to the fluorescent marker GFP. To further dissect the mechanism by which WLIM1 binds to, stabilizes, and bundles actin filaments, recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli with a His6 tag at the C terminus, affinity purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetate-agarose matrix (Fig. 1B), and used in a series of in vitro experiments.FIGURE 1Tobacco WLIM1 and its derived variants.A, domain topology of tobacco WLIM1 and the peptides used in this study. WLIM1 basically comprises a short N-terminal domain (Nt), two LIM domains (LIM1 and LIM2), an interLIM spacer (IL), and a C-terminal domain (Ct). Four deletion variants (WLIM1ΔLIM1, WLIM1ΔIL, WLIM1ΔLIM2, and WLIM1ΔCt) as well as two single LIM domains (LIM1 and LIM2) have been generated. They were either fused to GFP to study their subcellular localization in tobacco BY2 cells or expressed in E. coli for in vitro investigations. B, production of wild type WLIM1 and WLIM1 variants in E. coli. About 4 μg of protein was loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and submitted to electrophoresis. Protein bands were revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. The molecular masses of standard proteins are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The in Vivo WLIM1/F-actin Interaction Relies on the Two LIM Domains of WLIM1—The subcellular localization of GFP-fused WLIM1 deletion variants was analyzed in tobacco BY2 cells transiently transformed by biolistics. To make sure that GFP does not interfere with the proper targeting of the peptides, both N- and C-terminal fusions were constructed and tested. As the two types of fusions produced equivalent results, only those corresponding to C-terminal GFP fusions are presented here. Consistent with the pattern previously described using a stably transformed BY2 line (24Thomas C. Hoffmann C. Dieterle M. Van Troys M. Ampe C. Steinmetz A. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2194-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the full-length protein accumulated in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm where it predominantly associated with the actin cytoskeleton. A statistical analysis revealed that 98% of the cells exhibited this pattern, whereas only 2% exhibited a diffuse fluorescent pattern in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). WLIM1ΔIL-GFP and WLIM1ΔCt-GFP showed a distribution identical to that of WLIM1. Indeed, 95 and 96% of the cells exhibited a sharp actin cytoskeleton labeling, respectively (Fig. 2A). Such a labeling is illustrated in Fig. 2B for cells expressing the WLIM1ΔCt-GFP fusion protein. In contrast, the ability of the one-LIM domain deleted variants and of the single LIM domains to interact with actin filaments in BY2 cells was dramatically impaired. Indeed, only 7, 9, 5, and 3% of the cells transformed with WLIM1ΔLIM1-GFP, WLIM1ΔLIM2-GFP, LIM1, and LIM2, respectively, displayed a clear actin cytoskeleton labeling (Fig. 2A). The vast majority of the cells exhibited a diffuse fluorescent pattern or an only weak actin cytoskeleton labeling as illustrated in Fig. 2B for a WLIM1ΔLIM1-GFP expressing cell. Together these observations indicate that the interLIM spacer and the C-terminal domain are not essential for actin cytoskeleton targeting, whereas both LIM domains are important for efficient actin binding activity. The Two LIM Domains of WLIM1 Exhibit Autonomous Actin Binding Activity in Vitro—The actin binding activity of WLIM1 and its deletion variants was assessed in high-speed (200000g) cosedimentation assays. Each recombinant protein (4 μm) was incubated 1 h with prepolymerized F-actin (8 μm), the mixture was centrifuged, and the resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Control experiments indicated that the recombinant proteins do not sediment when centrifuged without F-actin (data not shown). WLIM1, WLIM1ΔIL, and WLIM1ΔCt were found almost exclusively in the pellet fraction, indicating that these proteins interact with high affinity with F-actin (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the deletion of one LIM domain impacted negatively the affinity of WLIM1 for F-actin, as indicated by the high amount of WLIM1ΔLIM1 and WLIM1ΔLIM2 detected in the supernatant fraction. Importantly, the interaction with actin filaments was not totally abolished, suggesting that each of the LIM domains has actin binding activity. To further compare the affinity for actin filaments of the WLIM1 variants, additional high-speed cosedimentation assays were performed using increasing protein concentrations. To test the hypothesis that each LIM domain possesses an intrinsic actin binding activity, single recombinant LIM1 and LIM2 domains were included in the study. After centrifugation, the amount of protein in the supernatant and pellet fractions was quantified by densitometry and the F-actin-bound protein was plotted against unbound protein as illustrated Fig. 3B for WLIM1ΔCt and WLIM1ΔLI1. Kd values were determined by fitting experimental data with a hyperbolic function. A mean dissociation constant (Kd ± S.D.) value was calculated for each protein from independent experiments (Table 1). Relatively similar Kd values were obtained for wild-type WLIM1, WLIM1ΔIL, and WLIM1ΔCt, i.e. 1.7 ± 0.2, 2.6 ± 0.5, and 1.5 ± 0.2 μm, respectively. This is consistent with the statement that the interLIM and the C-terminal domains are not essential for the actin binding activity of WLIM1. In contrast, the deletion of one LIM domain significantly reduced the affinity of the protein for actin filaments. Interestingly, the deletion of LIM1 appeared more detrimental (Kd = 16.6 ± 2.6 μm for WLIM1ΔLIM1) than the deletion of LIM2 (Kd = 8.2 ± 1.8 μm for WLIM1ΔLIM2), suggesting that LIM1 has the highest affinity for actin filaments. This hypothesis was confirmed by the data obtained with single LIM domains. Indeed, mean Kd values of 6.2 ± 1.8 and 16.6 ± 1.5 μm were, respectively, calculated for LIM1 and LIM2. Strikingly, mean Kd values obtained for WLIM1ΔLIM1 and LIM2, which both contain the LIM2 domain as only LIM domain, do not differ significantly (16.6 ± 2.6 and 16.6 ± 1.5 μm, respectively). In the same way, the mean Kd values obtained for WLIM1ΔLIM2 and LIM1, which both contain the LIM1 domain as only LIM domain, are similar (8.2 ± 1.8 and 6.2 ± 1.8 μm, respectively).TABLE 1Affinities of the full-length WLIM1 and WLIM1 variants for actin filaments Mean Kd values (±S.D.) were calculated from three independent high-speed cosedimentation experiments after fitting the data (bound protein plotted against free protein, see Fig. 3) with a hyperbolic function.ProteinKdμmWLIM11.7 ±"

The type III secretion apparatus is composed of a basal body and an exposed needle that is an extended polymer of MxiH with a 2.0-nm inner channel. Invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD) resides at the tip of the needle to control type III secretion. The atomic structures of MxiH and IpaD have been solved. MxiH (8.3 kDa) is a helix-turn-helix, whereas IpaD (36.6 kDa) has a dumbbell shape with two globular domains flanking a central coiled-coil that stabilizes the protein. These structures alone, however, have not been sufficient to produce a workable in silico model by which IpaD docks at the needle tip. Thus, the work presented here provides an initial step in understanding this important protein-protein interaction. We have identified key MxiH residues located in its PSNP loop and the contiguous surface that uniquely contribute to the formation of the IpaD-needle interface as determined by NMR chemical shift mapping. Mutation of Asn-43, Leu-47, and Tyr-50 residues severely affects the stable maintenance of IpaD at the Shigella surface and thus compromises the invasive phenotype of S. flexneri. Other residues could be mutated to give rise to intermediate phenotypes, suggesting they have a role in tip complex stabilization while not being essential for tip complex formation. Initial in vitro fluorescence polarization studies confirmed that specific amino acid changes adversely affect the MxiH-IpaD interaction. Meanwhile, none of the mutations appeared to have a negative effect on the MxiH-MxiH interactions required for efficient needle assembly.

Shigella flexneri is a Gram-negative bacterium and the causative agent of shigellosis, a potentially life-threatening form of bacillary dysentery. Although shigellosis is often considered a disease restricted to the developing world, it is also a problem in industrialized nations as an infectious agent in daycare centers, nursing homes, and situations where public health infrastructure becomes compromised (1Mohle-Boetani J.C. Kim M. Finger R. Bean N.H. Poundstone J. Blake P.A. Griffin P.M. Am. J. Public Health. 1995; 85: 812-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The problems posed by shigellosis are compounded by increasing numbers of antibiotic-resistant isolates and the need to send aid personnel to endemic areas (2Dutta S. Kim A. Ghosh K. Dutta D. Bhattacharya S.K. Nair G.B. Yoshida S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2003; 41: 5833-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Once ingested, Shigella passes through the stomach to the colonic mucosa where it crosses M cells into gut-associated lymphoid tissues (3Parsot C. Kim P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 209: 25-42PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterium then enters macrophages and induces them to undergo apoptosis (4Zychlinsky A. Kim M.C. Sansonetti P.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), which leads to release of the pathogen at the basolateral side of the colonic epithelium. Shigella then promotes its own uptake into epithelial cells by inducing cytoskeletal rearrangements in these cells (5Tran Van Nhieu G. Kim P.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Cossart P. Kim P.J. Science. 2004; 304: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar).

It is composed of a basal body that spans both bacterial membranes and an exposed needle that is a polymer of MxiH. The needle is ∼50 nm in length, has an outer diameter of 7.0 nm, and possesses an inner channel that is ∼2.0-3.0 nm in diameter (10Blocker A. Kim N. Larquet E. Gounon P. Ebel F. Parsot C.

We recently demonstrated that invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD) localizes to the tip of the TTSA needle (12Espina M. Kim A.J. Kenjale R. Moore D.S. Ausar S.F. Kaminski R.W. Oaks E.V. Middaugh C.R. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4391-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), where it controls secretion of the translocator proteins IpaB and IpaC and directs their insertion into host cell membranes (13Picking W.L. Kim H. Hearn P.D. Baxter M.A. Harrington A.T. Blocker A. Picking W.D. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). From its position at the TTSA needle tip, IpaD is responsible for recruiting and stably maintaining IpaB to this site in the presence of bile salts (14Olive A.J. Kim R. Espina M. Moore D.S. Picking W.L. Picking W.D. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 2626-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This is an essential step for Shigella invasiveness, and the interactions between IpaD and MxiH that are responsible for tip complex stabilization are thus critical for Shigella pathogenesis (12Espina M. Kim A.J. Kenjale R. Moore D.S. Ausar S.F. Kaminski R.W. Oaks E.V. Middaugh C.R. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4391-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Olive A.J.

Daniell S. Booy F. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Blocker A.J. Lea S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12529-12533Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Johnson S. Kim P. Espina M.

Kim P. Cordes F.S. Johnson S. Kenjale R. Daniell S. Booy F. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Blocker A.J. Lea S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12529-12533Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The head group is stabilized by hydrophobic contacts of residues at the interface between the two helices that flank a central PSNP loop (15Deane J.E. Kim P. Cordes F.S. Johnson S. Kenjale R. Daniell S. Booy F. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Blocker A.J. Lea S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12529-12533Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Likewise, the TTSA needle appears to pack by polar contacts between the individual MxiH monomers with the PSNP loop facing outward and upward relative to the central channel (15Deane J.E. Kim P. Cordes F.S. Johnson S. Kenjale R. Daniell S. Booy F. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Blocker A.J. Lea S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12529-12533Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In contrast to MxiH, IpaD has a more complex structure that gives it a dumbbell shape (16Johnson S. Kim P. Espina M. Olive A. Deane J.E. Birket S. Field T. Picking W.D. Blocker A.J. Galyov E.E. Picking W.L. Lea S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4035-4044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). IpaD has a central coiled-coil that defines the handle of the dumbbell and is flanked at each end by distinct N- and C-terminal domains (16Johnson S. Kim P. Espina M. Olive A. Deane J.E. Birket S.

This shape defines the tip proteins as a unique class (17Espina M. Kim S.F. Middaugh C.R. Baxter M.A. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and appears to be important for IpaD localization at the tip of the needle (12Espina M. Kim A.J. Kenjale R. Moore D.S. Ausar S.F. Kaminski R.W. Oaks E.V. Middaugh C.R. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4391-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Based on in silico modeling of the Yersinia tip complex protein LcrV on the Shigella MxiH needle tip, the LcrV N-terminal globular domain and the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil are both required in docking LcrV on the needle (15Deane J.E. Kim P. Cordes F.S. Johnson S. Kenjale R. Daniell S. Booy F. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Blocker A.J. Lea S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12529-12533Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the IpaD structure shows that the N-terminal domain can mimic a MxiH molecule and possibly serve to chaperone the C-terminal coil to prevent the binding of MxiH and IpaD in the cytoplasm, how IpaD docks to MxiH could not be resolved even after the structure of the two proteins became available (16Johnson S. Kim P. Espina M. Olive A. Deane J.E. Birket S. Field T. Picking W.D. Blocker A.J. Galyov E.E. Picking W.L. Lea S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4035-4044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, interactions in addition to those that dictate needle assembly would be expected to be involved in maintaining IpaD at the needle tip. We therefore chose to examine the structural basis for the interaction between MxiH and IpaD. The data presented here show that specific residues within the MxiH head group are located at the MxiH-IpaD interface. These residues are needed for stable maintenance of IpaD at the TTSA needle tip but are distinct from those needed for needle assembly.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Antibodies to MxiH and IpaD were a kind gift from E. V. Oaks (Walter Reed Army Institute for Research, Silver Springs, MD). The S. flexneri mxiH null strain SH116 was from A. Allaoui (Brussels, Belgium) and grown at 37 °C in trypticase soy agar containing 0.025% Congo red to ensure the presence of the virulence plasmid. Sheep red blood cells were from Colorado Serum Company (Denver, CO). Fluorescent probes and Alexa Fluor-labeled secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Escherichia coli Tuner(DE3), pET15b, pET22b, and ligation reagents were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Tozer, MA). Oligonucleotide primers were from IDT (Coralville, IA). 15N-Ammonium chloride and 13C6-glucose were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA). Iminodiacetic acid affinity resin was from Sigma. Other chemicals were reagent grade.Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant IpaD was prepared by standard methods as previously described (18Marquart M.E. Kim W.L. Picking W.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The mxiHΔ5/pET22b was subcloned from pRKmxiHCΔ5 (19Kenjale R. Kim J. Zenk S.F. Saurya S. Picking W.L. Picking W.D.

This was the construct used to solve the crystal structure of MxiHCΔ5 (15Deane J.E. Kim P. Cordes F.S. Johnson S. Kenjale R. Daniell S. Booy F. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Blocker A.J. Lea S.M. Proc.

To maintain MxiH in monomeric form, five codons have been deleted from the 3′-end of the mxiH coding sequence, mxiHCΔ5, giving rise to MxiHCΔ5. This mutation also prevents polymerization of needles in vivo, resulting in secretion of MxiHCΔ5 monomers but a phenotype that is otherwise like a mxiH null mutant (19Kenjale R. Kim J. Zenk S.F. Saurya S. Picking W.L. Picking W.D. Blocker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42929-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To obtain uniformly 15N,13C-labeled MxiHCΔ5, mxiHΔ5/pET22b in E. coli Tuner(DE3) was grown in minimal medium supplemented with 15N NH4Cl and 13C-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively (21Zhang L. Kim Y. Picking W.L. Picking W.D. De Guzman R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After reaching mid log phase, bacteria were induced to produce protein with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown at 15 °C overnight. Bacteria were collected, resuspended in IMAC binding buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) and sonicated, and the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Recombinant protein was purified via His6 tag by IMAC chromatography as described (20Deane J.E. Kim F.S. Roversi P. Johnson S. Kenjale R. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Lea S.M. Blocker A.

Fractions were pooled and dialyzed into appropriate buffers (see below), and the protein concentration was estimated by UV absorbance at 280 nm.NMR Spectroscopy—Uniformly 15N- or 15N,13C-labeled MxiHCΔ5 and unlabeled IpaD were dissolved in NMR buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 10 mm NaCl, 10% D2O, and 90% H2O). NMR data were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance 800 MHz spectrometer fitted with a cryogenic triple-resonance probe and a Z-axis pulse field gradient. NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (23Delaglio F. Kim G.W. Vuister Z. Guang J.Pfeifer Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11379) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (24Johnson B.A. Kim R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 604-613Crossref Scopus (2661) Google Scholar). Backbone resonances of free MxiHCΔ5 were assigned using 1H-15N HSQC, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCACB acquired using a 0.8 mm 15N,13C-MxiHCΔ5 sample as described for BsaLCΔ5 (21Zhang L. Kim Y. Picking W.L. Picking W.D. De Guzman R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Chemical shift mapping was done by acquiring two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC at MxiH CΔ5:IpaD molar ratios of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8. Both IpaD and MxiHCΔ5 were dialyzed into the same buffer prior to titration to assure that the chemical shift changes were only due to protein-protein interactions and not to changes in solution condition upon mixing.Preparation of mxiH Mutants for Expression in S. flexneri SH116—pRKmxiH containing the mxiH gene has been described (19Kenjale R.

The PCR product was digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme, intramolecularly ligated, and used to transform E. coli NovaBlue. Double-stranded sequencing was performed on each new mutant mxiH gene to ensure only the desired mutation was incorporated. Each plasmid was electroporated into S. flexneri SH116. Ampicillin selection ensured presence of the plasmid while kanamycin resistance and/or Congo red binding indicated the presence of the Shigella virulence plasmid.Phenotypic Characterization of S. flexneri SH116 Expressing Different mxiH Mutants—The phenotype of each newly generated mxiH point mutant strain of Shigella was determined by standard assays. Shigella invasion functions were tested using a gentamycin protection invasion assay with cultured Henle 407 as described (25Picking W.L. Kim L. Osiecki J.C. Barnoski Serfis A. Schaper E.

Contact-mediated hemolysis with sheep erythrocytes was used to measure the IpaD-dependent insertion of IpaB and IpaC into target cell membranes as described (25Picking W.L. Kim L. Osiecki J.C. Barnoski Serfis A. Schaper E. Picking W.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 100-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The overnight secretion of Ipa proteins into Shigella culture supernatants was used to ascertain the presence of functional TTSAs and, more specifically, the assembly of functional MxiH needles with IpaD at the tip as recently described (12Espina M. Kim A.J. Kenjale R. Moore D.S. Ausar S.F. Kaminski R.W. Oaks E.V. Middaugh C.R. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4391-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Induction of type III secretion was tested using Congo red as an artificial inducer of secretion (19Kenjale R. Kim J. Zenk S.F. Saurya S. Picking W.L. Picking W.D. Blocker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42929-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In S. flexneri, type III secretion occurs upon host cell contact; however, this event can be mimicked by the addition of Congo red (26Bahrani F.K. Kim P.J. Parsot C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4005-4010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The surface localization of IpaD was determined using immunofluorescence microscopy while the ability to polymerize MxiH needles was determined by transmission electron microscopy as recently described (12Espina M. Kim A.J. Kenjale R. Moore D.S. Ausar S.F. Kaminski R.W. Oaks E.V. Middaugh C.R. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4391-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Kenjale R.

Kim P. Cordes F.S. Johnson S. Kenjale R. Daniell S. Booy F. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Blocker A.J. Lea S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12529-12533Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mutant mxiHCΔ5 genes were copied from the corresponding pLZ plasmid by PCR using a 5′-primer containing GAGAGA, an NdeI restriction site, and the first 18 bases of mxiH and a 3′-primer containing GAGAGA, a XhoI restriction site, and the last 18 bases of mxiH excluding the stop codon and the last 5 amino acids. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into correspondingly digested pET22b, and the ligated product was transformed into E. coli NovaBlue. Double-stranded sequencing was performed on each new mutant mxiHCΔ5 gene to confirm that only the desired mutation was incorporated. The resulting plasmid was used to transform E. coli Tuner(DE3). This strain was used for purification of the mutant MxiHCΔ5 proteins as previously described (22Darboe N. Kim R. Picking W.L. Picking W.D. Middaugh C.R. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Polarization—The interaction of IpaD with MxiHCΔ5 and MxiHCΔ5 mutants was measured by fluorescence polarization (FP) (27Harrington A.T. Kim P.D. Picking W.L. Barker J.R. Wessel A. Picking W.D. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FP provides a measure of the rotational diffusion for a fluorescent molecule in solution. Small molecules rotate quickly, which produces rapid depolarization of the population of fluorescent molecules selected using excitation by polarized light, thus giving rise to low millipolarization (mP) values. In contrast, larger molecules rotate more slowly and display a reduced rate in depolarization in aqueous solution, thereby leading to larger mP values. The association of a small fluorescent species with a larger nonfluorescent species results in a significant increase in overall molecular volume, thus resulting in an increase in the mP of the fluorescent species.IpaD was labeled with fluorescein at its single Cys residue by combining 1 ml of IpaD (3 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) with 50 μl of fluorescein maleimide (FM) prepared as a 1 mg/ml stock prepared in N,N-dimethylformamide. After incubating the mixture for 1 h at 4 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding dithiothreitol to 1 mm. The FM-IpaD was isolated from the free fluorophore by gel filtration using Sephadex G-50. FP measurements were obtained using a Beacon fluorescence polarimeter (Panvera Corp.) as described (27Harrington A.T. Kim P.D. Picking W.L. Barker J.R. Wessel A. Picking W.D. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, a constant concentration of FM-IpaD (20 nm) in phosphate-buffered saline was mixed with increasing concentrations of MxiHCΔ5. The change in FP, measured in millipolarization units (ΔmP), was monitored after adding nonfluorescent MxiHCΔ5.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMxiHCΔ5 Binding to IpaD—We recently showed that IpaD localizes to the tip of the TTSA needle (12Espina M. Kim A.J. Kenjale R. Moore D.S. Ausar S.F. Kaminski R.W. Oaks E.V. Middaugh C.R. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4391-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although our findings show that the C-terminal coil of IpaD is responsible for its maintenance at the MxiH needle tip, no such data are available to directly demonstrate the structural role of the TTSA needle protein in the IpaD-MxiH interaction. Using FP to detect in vitro protein-protein interactions, a direct interaction between MxiHCΔ5 and IpaD was identified (Fig. 1). IpaD was labeled with FM at Cys-322, which is the only free thiol in IpaD. Cys-322 is 10 residues away from the IpaD C terminus, and it is this portion of IpaD that mediates its stable association with the Shigella TTSA needle tip (12Espina M. Kim A.J. Kenjale R. Moore D.S. Ausar S.F. Kaminski R.W. Oaks E.V. Middaugh C.R. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4391-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The initial polarization value for IpaD was 247.9 ± 0.7, a high value that is consistent with the attachment of the probe to a large (36.6-kDa) protein. FM-IpaD association with MxiHCΔ5 resulted in a measured increase of 21.2 mP whereas no change was seen upon the addition of IpgC, the bacterial cytoplasmic type III secretion system translocator chaperone (Fig. 1). Because the maximum ΔmP achieved by the addition of anti-IpaD IgG is 30.8, the change in polarization upon addition of MxiHCΔ5 represents a significant change based on the fact that its mass is only one fourth that of IpaD. The fact that a detectable change is observed most likely stems from the previous observation that IpaD association with the MxiH needle involves the C terminus of IpaD (12Espina M. Kim A.J. Kenjale R. Moore D.S. Ausar S.F. Kaminski R.W. Oaks E.V. Middaugh C.R. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4391-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and this is near where the FM labeling occurs. The data presented thus indicate that IpaD and MxiHCΔ5 interactions are detectable in vitro. Furthermore, the binding data suggest that the two proteins have an apparent dissociation constant (kd) of ∼0.48 μm (Fig. 1).Identification of MxiHCΔ5 Residues Interacting with IpaD by NMR Spectroscopy—We used NMR chemical shift mapping to identify the MxiHCΔ5 residues that contact IpaD based on the reasoning that the MxiHCΔ5-IpaD interaction should result in changes in the NMR resonances of MxiHCΔ5. Because the smaller MxiHCΔ5 (8.3 kDa) is more amenable to NMR characterization compared with IpaD, we titrated unlabeled IpaD into 15N-labeled MxiHCΔ5 and monitored the changes in the chemical shifts of MxiHCΔ5 by acquiring several 15N HSQC spectra with increasing amounts of IpaD. Indeed, there are NMR peaks of MxiHCΔ5 that shift upon adding IpaD (Fig. 2). We assigned the resonances of free MxiHCΔ5 using standard three-dimensional NMR experiments (supplemental Fig. S1). Assigning the NMR peaks of free MxiHCΔ5 was challenging because of the broad peaks between 7.8-8.5 ppm in the center of the two-dimensional 15N HSQC spectra (Fig. 2A). The narrow proton chemical shift range is consistent with the predominantly α-helical structure of MxiHCΔ5 (15Deane J.E. Kim P. Cordes F.S. Johnson S. Kenjale R. Daniell S. Booy F. Picking W.D.

A. 2006; 103: 12529-12533Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and the disordered N-terminal 19 residues in the x-ray structure of MxiHCΔ5 (15Deane J.E. Kim P. Cordes F.S. Johnson S. Kenjale R. Daniell S. Booy F. Picking W.D. Picking W.L. Blocker A.J. Lea S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12529-12533Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) likely contribute to the broad peaks between 7.8-8.5 ppm. Nevertheless, using three-dimensional HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCACB (supplemental Fig. S1), we assigned 62 of 78 backbone amides of MxiHCΔ5.FIGURE 2A, titration of 15N- MxiHCΔ5 with increasing amounts of unlabeled IpaD. Overlay of six protein-nitrogen correlation spectra (15N HSQC) at various MxiHCΔ5:IpaD molar ratios (black, 0; red, 0.5; green, 1.0; blue, 2.0; yellow, 4.0; magenta, 8.0). The actual MxiHCΔ5:IpaD concentrations used are as follows (in μm): black (800:0), red (320:160), green (200:200), blue (110:220), yellow (60:240), and magenta (30:250). Peaks with * could not be assigned because they did not show cross-peaks on the 13C plane in the three-dimensional data sets (HNCA, CBCACONH, and HNCACB) used in the backbone assignments. The insert shows an expansion of a crowded region of the 15N HSQC. MxiHCΔ5 contains a single tryptophan, and the side chain Trp-10 Nε1 resonance (at 15n = 129.375 and 1H = 10.076) was not perturbed upon addition of IpaD and therefore is not shown. B, the HSQC peaks of individual residues affected by IpaD binding are shown separately for clarity. MxiH residues th"
https://openalex.org/W1968915339,"We report the cloning, expression, purification, and characterization of the Trypanosoma cruzi exopolyphosphatase (TcPPX). The product of this gene (TcPPX), has 383 amino acids and a molecular mass of 43.1 kDa. TcPPX differs from most exopolyphosphatases in its preference for short-chain polyphosphate (poly P). Heterologous expression of TcPPX in Escherichia coli produced a functional enzyme that had a neutral optimum pH and was dramatically inhibited by low concentrations of Zn2+, high concentrations of basic amino acids (lysine and arginine), and heparin. TcPPX is a processive enzyme and does not hydrolyze ATP, pyrophosphate, or p-nitrophenyl phosphate, although it hydrolyzes guanosine 5′-tetraphosphate very efficiently. Overexpression of TcPPX resulted in a dramatic decrease in total short-chain poly P and partial decrease in long-chain poly P. This was accompanied by a delayed regulatory volume decrease after hyposmotic stress. These results support the role of poly P in T. cruzi osmoregulation."

However, both UvsW and UvsW-K141R are capable of stabilizing Holliday junctions against spontaneous branch migration when ATP is not present. Using two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis we also show that UvsW acts on T4-generated replication intermediates, including Holliday junction-containing X-shaped intermediates and replication fork-shaped intermediates.

Taken together, these results strongly support a role for UvsW in the branch migration of Holliday junctions that form during T4 recombination, replication, and repair. Homologous recombination plays essential, but seemingly paradoxical, roles in promoting genetic diversity through meiotic recombination and in maintaining genomic stability. The importance of recombination in genomic stability is ensured by its roles in the repair of DNA damage such as double strand breaks and in the restart of stalled replication forks (for review, see Ref. (1McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar)). For all of these processes, the Holliday junction (HJ) 2The abbreviations used are: HJ, Holliday junction; BM, branch migration; RDR, recombination-dependent replication; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). is a common feature. HJs can be formed through an enzyme-mediated process that involves the invasion of a single-stranded portion of a DNA into a homologous sequence in another DNA. HJs may also be formed through regression of an inactive replication fork. The branch point of a HJ can migrate through strand exchange, as long as both participating duplex segments are homologous. Branch migration (BM) has been shown to be catalyzed by a number of enzymes including RecG (2Whitby M.C. Vincent S.D. Lloyd R.G.

Bacteriophage T4 has been used as a model biological system since the early days of molecular biology and has been invaluable in advancing our understanding of many fundamental biological processes. The T4 genome encodes ∼300 different proteins, including all essential enzymes at the replication fork, making it a relatively simple organism to study (7Miller E.S. Kutter E. Mosig G. Arisaka F. Kunisawa T. Ruger W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67 (Table of contents): 86-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Furthermore, T4 proteins show about as much sequence homology to eukaryotes as they do to prokaryotes (8Bernstein H. Bernstein C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2265-2270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, T4 DNA polymerase (gp43) shows strong homology to the B family DNA polymerases of the archaeal, eucaryal, and viral kingdoms (9Spicer E.K. Rush J. Fung C. Reha-Krantz L.J. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7478-7486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); T4 thymidylate synthase and the replisome sliding clamp protein (gp45) show extensive conserved regions with the corresponding proteins from Bacteria and Eucary; and a subunit of the DNA polymerase clamp loader, gp44, is homologous to eukaryotic replication factor C (7Miller E.S. Kutter E. Mosig G. Arisaka F. Kunisawa T. Ruger W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67 (Table of contents): 86-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Replication proceeds through two distinct pathways in T4 infections (10Kreuzer K.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Origin-dependent replication initiates at specific replication origins in the early stages of infection by assembly of replication complexes onto persistent RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops). Recombination-dependent replication (RDR) predominates later in infection, and involves the assembly of replication fork complexes onto D-loop recombination intermediates. The same enzymes involved in RDR are also involved in double-stranded DNA break repair, and thus the processes of recombination, replication and DNA repair are all tightly interconnected (11George J.W. Stohr B.A. Tomso D.J. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8290-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Kreuzer K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 43-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The T4 UvsW gene was first identified through mutant phenotypes which included increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea, decreased recombination, increased sensitivity to UV, and decreased UV mutability (13Derr L.K. Kreuzer K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Derr L.K. Drake J.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Some UvsW mutants had dissimilar effects on replication and double-strand break repair, indicating that UvsW might have distinct multiple functions that could be uncoupled (14Derr L.K. Drake J.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that the UvsW protein could unwind R-loops in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro. Furthermore, expression of UvsW at late times of infection represses origin-dependent replication presumably by unwinding the origin R-loop intermediate (16Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2706-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, UvsW protein was found to possess a branched-DNA specific helicase activity that was ATP-dependent and abolished by the K141R mutation in the Walker A motif of a RecA-like domain of UvsW (15Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Subsequent x-ray crystallography of the N-terminal region of UvsW-K141R confirmed that the protein fits the structural profile of a superfamily II DNA helicase and suggested unique structural domains for DNA binding (17Sickmier E.A. Kreuzer K.N. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). UvsW has also been shown to function as a 3′→5′ helicase and to promote single-stranded DNA annealing (18Nelson S.W. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The UvsW protein can complement E. coli recG rnhA double mutants, most likely through unwinding of persistent R-loops in the bacterial chromosome (15Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the E. coli RecG helicase shows very similar functional properties to UvsW, including R-loop unwinding, branched-DNA specific unwinding, and a weak 3′ → 5′ helicase activity, though there is only limited structural homology between the two (17Sickmier E.A. Kreuzer K.N. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3049-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). RecG has been shown to promote BM of HJs in vitro, and to facilitate the regression of stalled replication forks (20McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8227-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 21Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19729-19739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Double-strand break repair is only partially reduced in T4 mutants lacking gp49 (Endo VII; HJ cleaving endonuclease), but is completely lost in the uvsW/49 double mutant (15Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This suggests that HJs can be processed by two different pathways in a T4 infection: Endo VII-catalyzed cleavage and a UvsW-promoted HJ resolving activity, most likely involving BM. To date, however, the enzyme(s) responsible for in vivo BM of HJs in T4 has not been identified, although the strand exchange enzyme UvsX and the helicase gp41 (in conjunction with its loader protein gp59) have been shown to promote 3-strand BM in vitro (22Salinas F. Kodadek T. Cell. 1995; 82: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The roles of UvsW protein in recombination, repair and mutagenesis, together with the similarities to RecG, suggest that UvsW could be a HJ BM enzyme. Here we confirm this prediction by showing that UvsW promotes the migration of a HJ through ∼1000 bp of DNA, using a novel HJ-containing substrate that should be generally useful. We also show that UvsW can resolve HJs and replication fork intermediates composed of T4-modified DNA generated during T4 infection. Enzymes—Dda helicase was a generous gift of Dr. Stephen W. White (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). RNase (DNase-free) was obtained from Roche Applied Sciences (Indianapolis, IN) and PreScission protease was obtained from GE Healthcare (Buckinghamshire, UK). Reverse gyrase was purified from Archaeoglobus fulgidus according to a published procedure (23Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Expression Plasmid Construction—The plasmid pKCK47 carries the UvsW gene (GenBank™ accession AF158101.6; Tulane T4-like genome data base) as a GST fusion in a pGEX-3X expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) (15Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Repeated DNA sequencing of this construct as well as a PCR product of T4 genomic DNA consistently showed an AG → GA sequence inversion at T4 map position 114045 (update 3/28/2003). Thus, the data base sequence was incorrect, and the codon 457 should read GAC (aspartate) rather than AGC (serine). The plasmid pKCK48 carries a point mutation that causes amino acid substitution K141R in UvsW. To produce the inframe expression constructs described below, both plasmids were modified by insertion of a cytosine two bases upstream of the UvsW start codon using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The plasmids were then digested with BamHI, and the resulting UvsW- and UvsW-K141R-containing fragments were ligated to BamHI-digested plasmid pGEX-6p-1 (Amersham Biosciences) producing the UvsW-containing plasmid pMRW47-6p, and the K141R-containing plasmid, pMRW48-6p. These constructs generated glutathione S-transferase (GST)-UvsW fusions under control of the IPTG-inducible Ptac promoter. The linker region of pGEX-6p-1 encodes a unique amino acid sequence that is cleaved by Prescission protease, allowing the selective cleavage of GST from the fusion products. The residual peptide GPLGST remains attached to the N-terminal end of the purified proteins following cleavage. A version of pGEX-6p-1 that had its ColE1-based origin of replication replaced with an R6K γ replication origin was constructed as follows. Plasmid pGEX-6p-1 was first digested with AlwNI and PflMI, producing two fragments, the smaller of which contained only the ColE1-based replication origin and flanking, non-coding, sequences. To obtain an R6K γ replication origin sequence with PflMI- and AlwNI-ligatable ends, the R6K γ-containing plasmid pGPS4 (New England Biolabs) was used as a template for PCR amplification using primers flanking the origin sequence (position 369 through 678) but designed to produce PflMI- and AlwNI-digestible ends. The purified PCR product was then digested with PflMI and AlwNI, repurified, and ligated to the purified, large AlwNI/PflMI pGEX-6p-1 digestion fragment (minus the ColE1 replication origin). The resulting plasmid (pMRW3) was transformed into a π protein-expressing strain of E. coli, BW23322 (Δ(argF-lac)169, ΔuidA4::pir-116, rpoS396(Am), endA9(del-ins)::FRT, rph-1, hsdR514, creC510, robA1), selected with ampicillin and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. To produce a UvsW-expressing version of pMRW3, both pMRW3 and pMRW47-6p were digested with BsaI and EcoNI. The gel-purified fragment containing the R6K γ replication origin from pMRW3 was then ligated to the UvsW-containing fragment of pMRW47-6p using T4 DNA ligase. The resulting plasmid (pMRW7) was obtained after transformation into BW23322 and confirmed by sequence analysis. UvsW Protein Purification—E. coli strain BW23322 containing the pMRW7 plasmid was grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of Luria broth (LB) containing carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) with vigorous shaking to an A600 of ∼1.0, at which point IPTG was added to 1 mm. After 1 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g (4 °C) and resuspended in 8 volumes of PBSX (10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2HPO4, 3 mm KCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) containing one Complete™ (Mini) Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). Resuspended cells were frozen in dry ice/ethanol and either stored at -80 °C or used immediately as follows. After thawing, the cells were treated with Triton X-100 (0.2%) and lysozyme (1 mg/ml), refrozen and thawed, and then sonicated. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 20 min, followed by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter. ATP (2 mm) and Mg2+ (4 mm) were added to the homogenate which was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin was then added and gently mixed for 1.5 h at 4 °C. This suspension was placed in a column, washed three times with PBSX, and then treated with RNase (5 μg) by mixing one bed volume of an RNase-TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6; 0.25 mm EDTA) with the resin and incubating for 5 min at 37 °C. The column was then washed three times with HPB (290 mm Na2HPO4, 110 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) and once with PPCB (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), and then PreScission protease (20 units in one bed volume of PPCB) was added, and the protease-containing column was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. Cleaved protein was eluted with PBSX, and fractions were checked for purity using UV absorbance and SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. Selected fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad protein assay), and samples were stored at -20 °C. The overall yield was ∼600 μg. The UvsW-K141R protein was prepared as follows. A 0.5-liter LB culture of BL21/pLysS containing pMRW48-6p was grown to an A600 of ∼1.1 and induced with IPTG at 0.5 mm. The protein purification was essentially the same as that used for UvsW, except that K141R was eluted from the column using HPB. The overall yield was 1.4 mg. Oligonucleotide Substrates—DNA unwinding substrates (Table 1) were made by annealing the following oligonucleotides in the appropriate combinations, generally as described (24Brosh Jr., R.M. Opresko P.L. Bohr V.A. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 52-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Constantinou A. West S.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 262: 239-253PubMed Google Scholar). A0 (5′-ACGCTGCCGAATTCTGGCTTGCTAAAGGATAGGTCGAATTTCTCATTTT-3′), B0 (5′-CAAAGTAAGAGCTTCTCGAGCTGCGCTAGCAAGCCAGAATTCGGCAGCGT-3′), C0 (5′-TCTTTGCCCAAATGCAGGTTCACCCGCGCAGCTCGAGAAGCTCTTACTTTG-3′), D0 (5′-AAAATGAGAAAATTCGACCTATCCTTGGGTGAACCTGCATTTGGGCAAAGA-3′), E0 (5′-AAAATGAGAAAATTCGACCTATCCTTGCGCAGCTCGAGAAGCTCTTACTTTG-3′), a2 (5′-AAGGATAGGTCGAATTTTCTCATTTT-3′), b2 (5′-TAGCAAGCCAGAATTCGGCAGCGT-3′), c2 (5′-GCGCAGCTCGAGAAGCTCTTACTTTG-3′), d1 (5′-AAATGAGAAAATTCGACCTATCCTT-3′). All oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing PAGE with gel extraction prior to annealing and, after annealing, by non-denaturing PAGE with electroelution and dialysis into 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 5 mm MgCl2. Appropriate oligonucleotides were 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase; only one strand of each substrate was labeled (indicated by *). The molar concentrations of the final DNA substrates were estimated by relating the specific activity of the labeled oligonucleotide to the activity of the purified substrates. Gel reference markers were generated by denaturing the appropriate substrate at 100 °C for 5 min. Oligonucleotide-based Unwinding Assay—Reactions were carried out in 20 μl of helicase reaction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing MgCl2 and ATP as indicated. Typically, substrates were added to yield concentrations of 0.5 nm (10 fmol per reaction), followed immediately by the addition of enzyme or control solution. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then terminated by addition ofa2-μl stop buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 5 mg/ml proteinase K, 50% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol) containing 50 nm of the unlabeled version of the substrate used for that particular reaction. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and then separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels using 0.5× TBE (44.5 mm Tris-HCl, 44.5 mm borate, 1 mm disodium EDTA) at 4 °C (typically at 12.5 V/cm). Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid/methanol, dried briefly, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen overnight and visualized using PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). DNA-trioxsalen Cross-linking—DNA substrates (25-50 ng/μl) were treated with trioxsalen (final concentration 0.2 mm) and were exposed to a long-wave UV source for 20 min at room temperature. Double Holliday Junction Synthesis—The Double Holliday Junction Substrate 2 (DHJS-2) was synthesized utilizing methods developed by Plank and Hsieh (26Plank J.L. Hsieh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17510-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, A/B and B/A large heterodimers were prepared by annealing and linking purified ssDNA, using Archaeoglobus fulgidus reverse gyrase as described (27Plank J.L. Chu S.H. Pohlhaus J.R. Wilson-Sali T. Hsieh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3564-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The reactions were then stopped by the addition of EDTA to 10 mm and SDS to 1%, and incubated at 80 °C for an additional 5 min. KCl was added to 500 mm, and the solution was cooled on ice for 15 min to precipitate the KDS and protein. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the cleared supernatant containing the DNA was loaded onto a Qiagen DEAE column. The column was washed with a solution containing 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 m NaCl, 4 m urea, and 30% ethanol to remove any remaining ssDNA circles (28Bregeon D. Doetsch P.W. BioTechniques. 2004; 37 (764, 766): 760-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the large heterodimers were then eluted per kit instructions (Qiagen, Inc.). The two large heterodimers were then annealed and linked to each other using the same reaction conditions as above. This reaction was then stopped with the addition of EDTA to 10 mm and SDS to 1%, and the DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The substrate was then dissolved in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA and spectrophotometrically quantified. Holliday Junction Branch Migration Assay—DHJS-2 was digested simultaneously with BamHI and AlwNI for 1 h at 30 °C in NEBuffer 2 (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT). BM assays were carried out at 37 °C using the digested DHJS-2 in 20 μl of helicase reaction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing MgCl2 and ATP (or analogue) at the concentration indicated. Typically, DNA substrate concentrations were 7.5-15 ng/μl and substrate addition was followed immediately by the addition of enzyme or control solution. Reactions were terminated by addition of 2 μl of (10×) stop buffer (20% Ficoll, 1% SDS, 100 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol) and 2 μl of proteinase K (5 mg/ml). Following incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Gels were run overnight at 4 °C at 4 V/cm, destained, and the DNA was visualized using an Alphaimager (Alpha Innotech Corp.). T4 Infection and DNA Purification—Bacterial cells (E. coli CAG12135 derivative: acrA::Tn10-kan, recA::Tn10-cam, and recD) were grown with vigorous shaking at 37 °C to an A560 of 0.5 (∼4 × 108 per ml), and infected with T4 strain K10-49am [amB262 (gene 38), amS29 (gene 51), nd28 (denA), rIIPT8 (rII-denB deletion), amE727 (gene 49)] at a multiplicity of 6 PFU per cell. After 4 min at 37 °C without shaking, cells were incubated for an additional 28 min with shaking. Infected cells from 1 ml of culture were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 2 min, and immediately resuspended in 300 μl of SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS). Proteinase K was added to 0.5 mg/ml, and the suspension was incubated at 65 °C for 2 h. Total nucleic acid was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1), and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8; 1 mm EDTA). Two-dimensional Gel Analysis of T4 Replication Intermediates—Purified DNA from T4 infections was treated with the restriction enzyme PacI in 1× restriction buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C overnight. The restriction digestion reaction was then supplemented to give the following concentrations: 1 mm ATP, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 68 nm purified UvsW (unless otherwise indicated). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time, followed by sequential DNA extraction with phenol/chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the procedure of Friedman and Brewer (29Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, the first-dimension gel was a 0.4% agarose gel run in 0.5× TBE buffer for 30 h at 0.75 V/cm at room temperature. The desired gel lane was sliced from the first-dimension gel and cast across the top of the second-dimension 1% agarose gel, which was run in 0.5× TBE buffer containing 0.3 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 16 h at 4.5 V/cm at 4 °C. For Southern hybridization, agarose gels were transferred to a Nytran Super-Charge nylon transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schuell Bioscience, Inc) by the downward sponge method (30Ming Y.Z. Di X. Gomez-Sanchez E.P. Gomez-Sanchez C.E. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 58-59PubMed Google Scholar). The probe for the Southern blots consisted of a PCR fragment containing T4 origin ori(34) (T4 map positions 149.172-152.033 kb) labeled with [α-32P]dATP by using the Random Primed DNA Labeling kit (Roche Applied Sciences). Cloning and Expression of UvsW—UvsW and UvsW-K141R had been cloned and expressed as GST fusion proteins previously by this laboratory (15Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The purified GST-UvsW wild-type fusion protein possesses a branched-DNA specific and ATP-dependent helicase activity, and the lysine to arginine substitution (in the Walker A motif) abolished both ATPase and helicase activities. We sought untagged versions of the proteins for further biochemical characterization. To this end we cloned UvsW and the UvsW-K141R mutant into a GST fusion expression vector containing a PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) recognition site in the GST linker region. PreScission protease also has a GST fusion tag, allowing it to be used on-column to cleave glutathione-bound fusion proteins containing the recognition site. The cleaved protein product is then eluted without the need for glutathione, leaving the protease bound to the column. This strategy worked well for generating substantial amounts of the highly purified UvsW-K141R mutant protein (Fig. 1, lane 1). Attempts to obtain the wild-type UvsW protein using this system, however, were hampered by plasmid instability and low copy number. Because UvsW is known to unwind R-loops at replication initiation sites, we reasoned that replacing the R-loop-dependent ColE1-based plasmid origin with an R6K γ-based replication origin might improve UvsW production. The R6K γ origin uses the π initiator protein with no R-loop intermediate (31Abhyankar M.M. Reddy J.M. Sharma R. Bullesbach E. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6711-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The plasmid was found to be stable in strain BW23322, which encodes a mutated version of π (pir-116) that results in an increased plasmid copy number (32Metcalf W.W. Jiang W. Wanner B.L. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Initially, we found that UvsW was highly contaminated with RNA and a co-purifying protein which was identified by mass spectral analysis to be the chaperonin GroEL. Both contaminants were effectively eliminated by including an RNase treatment and an incubation with ATP/Mg2+ during the purification process (33Thain A. Gaston K. Jenkins O. Clarke A.R. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 209-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using these techniques and additional modifications of the standard extraction procedure, we were eventually able to obtain ∼600 μg of highly purified, soluble UvsW protein from 1 liter of culture (Fig. 1, lane 2). Unwinding of Oligonucleotide Substrates—The GST-UvsW fusion protein was previously shown to unwind a blunt-ended, fully duplex, branched-DNA Y substrate in the presence of ATP (15Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We began by analyzing the unwinding activity in more detail using the oligonucleotide-based substrates shown in Fig. 2. As in previous studies (15Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), UvsW was able to unwind a duplex DNA Y substrate, but not a blunt-ended linear DNA substrate (Fig. 2). We did not detect significant unwinding of double-stranded substrates with either 5′ or 3′ single-stranded overhangs (the latter contrary to an earlier report (18Nelson S.W. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)), or double-stranded DNA with a flayed single-stranded end (Fig. 2). In contrast, UvsW efficiently unwound the static X-junction into flayed duplexes (Fig. 2B). At an enzyme/substrate rati"

Two members of the Class II family have recently had the structures of their isolated amino-terminal regions solved by NMR, yet it remains unclear how that domain is aligned with the heptahelical transmembrane bundle domain of those receptors. Indeed, three distinct orientations have been suggested for different members of this family. In the current work, we have utilized fluorescence resonance energy transfer to establish the distances between four residues distributed throughout fully biologically active, high affinity analogues of secretin and distinct residues in each of four extracellular regions of the intact secretin receptor. These 16 distance constraints were utilized along with nine photoaffinity labeling spatial approximation constraints to study the three proposed orientations of the peptide-binding amino terminus and helical bundle domains of this receptor. In the best model, the carboxyl terminus of secretin was found to bind in a groove above the β-hairpin region of the receptor amino terminus, with its amino-terminal end adjacent to the third extracellular loop and top of transmembrane segment VI. This refined model of the intact receptor was also fully consistent with the spatial approximation of the Trp48-Asp49-Asn50 endogenous agonist segment with the third extracellular loop region that it has been shown to photolabel.

This provides strong evidence for the orientation of peptide-binding and signaling domains of a prototypic Class II G protein-coupled receptor. Understanding receptor structure provides critical insights for the development and refinement of drugs targeting these important molecules. Class II guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors include several potentially important drug targets, such as receptors for glucagon-like peptide, glucagon, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. The first receptor in this family to be cloned was the secretin receptor (1Ishihara T. Nakamura S. Kaziro Y. Takahashi T. Takahashi K. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) that is expressed on ductular cells of the pancreatic and biliary tree, where it mediates the secretion of bicarbonate-rich fluid. This receptor has become prototypic of Class II G protein-coupled receptors, sharing primary sequence signatures with the other receptors and key structural motifs, such as three conserved amino-terminal intradomain disulfide bonds (2Asmann Y.W. Dong M. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Lisenbee C.S. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12330-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, there is little known about the full three-dimensional structure of any of the receptors in this family. A substantial advance in our insight into the structure of Class II G protein-coupled receptors came recently with the solution of an NMR structure of the isolated amino terminus of the CRF2β receptor (4Grace C.R. Perrin M.H. DiGruccio M.R. Miller C.L. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12836-12841Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Based on homology of the primary sequence of the VPAC1 (5Tan Y.V. Couvineau A. Murail S. Ceraudo E. Neumann J.M. Lacapere J.J. Laburthe M. J. Biol.

Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), homologous amino-terminal structures have been proposed. However, the molecular mechanisms proposed for natural peptide ligand binding to these receptors are quite distinct (4Grace C.R. Perrin M.H. DiGruccio M.R. Miller C.L. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R.

Further, the proposed orientations of the amino-terminal domains of these receptors relative to their heptahelical transmembrane bundle regions are all distinct from each other (4Grace C.R. Perrin M.H. DiGruccio M.R. Miller C.L. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12836-12841Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 5Tan Y.V. Couvineau A.

Additional experimentally derived constraints beyond the integrity of the peptide backbone are required to determine the correct orientation between these two receptor domains. In the current work, we have generated such constraints by utilizing quantitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 3The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; KRH, Krebs-Ringer-HEPES. 3The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; KRH, Krebs-Ringer-HEPES. measurements between four residues distributed throughout secretin as it is docked with this receptor and distinct extracellular residues located within the amino terminus and within each of the loops of this receptor. The secretin-like fluorescent probes have previously been fully characterized as full agonist ligands (7Harikumar K.G. Hosohata K. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2543-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Further, the fluorescence properties of these probes established adequate mobility to satisfy the criteria necessary for valid FRET measurements (7Harikumar K.G. Hosohata K. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2543-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These 16 experimentally derived distances were utilized to refine three series of molecular models of secretin docked to its receptor that were constrained to accommodate the proposed orientations between the amino terminus and helical bundle domains of receptors in this family (4Grace C.R. Perrin M.H. DiGruccio M.R. Miller C.L. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12836-12841Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 5Tan Y.V. Couvineau A.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is notable that all three distinct orientations accommodated each of these photoaffinity labeling constraints reasonably well. There was, however, a gradient of accommodation of the FRET data, with the best series of models being oriented based on spatial approximation of the Trp48-Asp49-Asn50 region of the amino terminus with the top of transmembrane helix VI. This was based on WDN peptide photoaffinity labeling studies (12Dong M. Pinon D.I. Asmann Y.W. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The most marked difference in the three series of models was the location of this structural motif, found to be far away from the receptor core in the models analogous to the orientations proposed for the CRF2β and VPAC1 receptors (4Grace C.R. Perrin M.H. DiGruccio M.R. Miller C.L. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12836-12841Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 5Tan Y.V. Couvineau A.

Materials—Reagents used for receptor mutagenesis were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and Bio-Rad. Ham's F-12 cell culture medium, antibiotic supplements, and Lipofectamine-plus reagent were purchased from Invitrogen; Fetal Clone II was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT), and nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution was from Sigma. [Tyr10]secretin-27 and natural rat secretin were synthesized in our laboratory (13Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept.

This was purified to homogeneity (approximate specific radioactivity of 2000 Ci/mmol) by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. All other reagents were analytical grade. Secretin-like Fluorescent Probes—A series of secretin analogues that incorporated fluorescent Alexa488 into the amino terminus, midregion, and carboxyl terminus, in positions -1, 13, 22, and 29 (or +2 relative to natural secretin-27), were utilized as fluorescence donors for this work. These probes were previously prepared and validated as full agonists that bind saturably and specifically to the secretin receptor with high affinity (7Harikumar K.G. Hosohata K. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2543-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Their fluorescence characteristics, both when free in solution and when bound to the secretin receptor, have been described previously (7Harikumar K.G. Hosohata K. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2543-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Secretin Receptor Constructs—The cDNA encoding the wild type rat secretin receptor in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen) was used as template for preparation of the receptor constructs used in this work (Table 1). Based on the experimentally determined disulfide-bonding pattern (2Asmann Y.W. Dong M. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Lisenbee C.S. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12330-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the free cysteine residues not involved in disulfide bonds and available for reaction with sulfhydryl-reactive reagents were mutated to serine. These included replacement of residues in the amino-terminal region of the receptor (Cys11 and Cys186) with serine, both individually (C11S and C186S) and in groups (null-reactive pseudo-wild type secretin receptor (C11S,C186S)), as well as selective insertion of cysteine residues into the second (T261C) and third (V346C) extracellular loop domains of the null-reactive pseudo-wild type secretin receptor. Single codon mutations were introduced into the parental construct using appropriate sets of complementary forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers with the QuikChange mutagenesis method (Stratagene). Each mutated construct had its sequence confirmed by direct DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Details of secretin receptor mutant constructsReceptor constructsNomenclatureSite of receptor labeling (residue number)Wild type rat secretin receptorWT SecRNull cysteine-reactive receptor constructC11S,C186SAmino-terminal monoreactive construct (elimination of free cysteine residue in the first loop domain)C186S11First loop monoreactive construct (elimination of free cysteine residue in the amino-terminal domain)C11S186Second loop monoreactive construct (insertion of reactive cysteine into null-reactive receptor)(C11S,C186S)(T261C)261Third loop monoreactive construct (insertion of reactive cysteine into null-reactive receptor)(C11S,C186S)(V346C)346 Open table in a new tab Secretin Receptor-bearing Cell Lines—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing cysteine-reactive secretin receptor constructs were created for FRET studies. Parental CHO cells that do not express endogenous secretin receptor and that have no saturable secretin radioligand binding and no cAMP response to secretin were used to make stable cell lines expressing these mutants. Approximately one million parental CHO cells were seeded in a 10-cm Petri dish in Ham's F-12 medium and were transfected with 10 μg of the relevant cDNA construct using Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with trypsin and lifted from the dishes and transferred into flasks for selection using G-418. The receptor-bearing cells were enriched by sequential rounds of limiting dilution cloning. Selected receptor-bearing cells were confirmed by secretin binding and receptor activation. Receptor Binding Studies—CHO cells stably expressing wild type or mutant secretin receptor constructs were plated in 24-well Costar tissue culture plates at a density of ∼50,000 cells/well 3 days prior to receptor-binding assays. The cells were incubated with ∼5 pm [125I-Tyr10]secretin-27 in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled secretin in 0.5 ml of Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH) medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor at room temperature for 1 h. Nonspecific binding was defined as radioligand bound in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled secretin and was typically less than 15% of total cpm bound. After termination of the binding reaction by washing the cells twice with iced KRH medium, cells were lysed with 0.5 m NaOH, and the residual radioactivity in the lysate was quantified by a γ counter. Data were analyzed using the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (14Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar) and were graphed using the nonlinear least squares curve-fitting routine in the Prism 3.0 suite of programs by GraphPad (San Diego, CA). Biological Activity Assays—The ability of secretin receptor constructs to signal when stimulated with secretin was assessed by measuring cAMP responses in CHO cells expressing the relevant receptor constructs. For this, ∼8,000 cells were plated in each well of a 96-well plate 72 h prior to the assay. On the day of assay, cells were washed twice with PBS before being stimulated for 30 min at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of secretin (ranging from 10-12 to 10-6 m) in KRH buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% bacitracin, and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Reactions were stopped by adding 6% ice-cold perchloric acid. The supernatants were adjusted to pH 6, and cAMP levels were assayed in a 384-well white Optiplate using a LANCE kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. This assay uses a homogenous time-resolved FRET immunoassay based on the competition between a europium-labeled cAMP tracer complex and sample cAMP for binding sites on cAMP-specific antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor® 647. Briefly, samples (6 μl of supernatants from each well) and equal volumes of Alexa Fluor® 647-cAMP antibodies in KRH buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (1:100 dilution) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 12 μl of detection mix containing the europium-labeled streptavidin and biotin-cAMP was then added. After incubation for an additional 1 h, the time-resolved FRET signals at 615- and 665-nm wavelengths upon excitation at 340 nm were measured using the 2103 Envision fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The signals obtained at 665 nm were used directly for data analysis after subtraction of the readings from blank wells. The cAMP levels were calculated by interpolation using a cAMP standard curve. Design and Synthesis of Donor and Acceptor Groups for FRET Studies—Fluorescence donor and acceptor groups were chosen that were suitable for FRET studies. For donors, we used Alexa488-derivatized secretin peptides, and for acceptors, we utilized Alexa568-labeled secretin receptor constructs. This pair of fluorophores were found to have appropriate spectral overlap, with 50% energy transfer at 62 Å, similar to the analogous fluorophores used in our previous report of FRET at the ligand-occupied cholecystokinin receptor (15Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Harikumar K.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18631-18635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For the current study, the fluorescence donors were designed to situate the Alexa488 in a series of distinct positions throughout the secretin peptide, at its amino terminus, at its carboxyl terminus, and in two positions within the middle region of the peptide. We previously prepared and characterized these probes, establishing their high affinity binding and their full biological activity and characterizing their fluorescence properties both in solution and bound to secretin receptor (7Harikumar K.G. Hosohata K. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2543-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cysteine-reactive Alexa568-tagging reagent, Alexa568-MTS, was prepared as previously described (15Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Harikumar K.G. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18631-18635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This reagent was used to derivatize the accessible cysteine residues on the ectodomain of CHO cell lines stably expressing secretin receptor constructs having a single reactive cysteine residue. These included constructs with the reactive cysteine within the receptor amino terminus (Cys11), first exoloop (Cys186), second exoloop (Cys261), and third exoloop (Cys346) (illustrated in Fig. 1). Labeling of Cells Expressing Mutant Secretin Receptors—Derivatization of secretin receptors with Alexa568-MTS was carried out as described previously (15Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells expressing the monoreactive secretin receptor constructs were detached from tissue culture flasks using nonenzymatic cell dissociation medium and were incubated with 1 μm cell-impermeant Alexa568-MTS reagent for 20 min at room temperature in KRH medium. The unreacted MTS reagent was removed by washing and centrifugation. The Alexa568-labeled secretin receptorbearing cells were then incubated with 50 nm Alexa488-secretin fluorescent probes for 1 h at 4 °C. Labeled cells were washed with ice-cold buffer and resuspended in cold buffer for FRET studies. Control studies included the labeling of untransfected parental CHO cells with fluorescence donor and acceptor as well as performance of the experiment in the presence of a saturating concentration of nonfluorescent secretin. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Steady-state fluorescence was recorded using a Fluoromax-3 fluorometer (SPEX industries, Edison, NJ) at 25 °C with a 1-ml quartz cuvette. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements were made using intact cells. After excitation at 481 nm, multiple emission spectra were accumulated between 500 and 700 nm (scanned at 0.3 s/nm). Unlabeled cells were utilized as a control to correct for background fluorescence and light scatter. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—The critical distance (Ro) between the Alexa488-secretin probes (donor) and the Alexa568-secretin receptor constructs (acceptor) was calculated using the Förster equation, as described previously (15Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The critical distance between the donor and the acceptor at 50% transfer efficiency was calculated based on the equation, Ro = 9786 (Jn-4κ2QD)⅙ Å, where n is the refractive index of the medium (1.4 for aqueous medium) and κ2 is a geometric factor describing the relative orientation of the transition dipole of the donor and acceptor fluorophores. The orientation factor was considered to be ⅔, a condition that is valid if donor and/or acceptor can exhibit isotropic, dynamic orientation within the time scale of the fluorescence lifetime of the probes. Our previous steady state measurements of anisotropy of the receptor-bound probes (0.02-0.05) support this assignment, based on sufficient rotational freedom (7Harikumar K.G. Hosohata K. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2543-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). QD is the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor in the absence of acceptor. For the Alexa488-probes (donor), the quantum yield was determined based on the comparison of emission intensities with that of sodium fluorescein in 0.1 n NaOH, using a quantum yield value 0.92 for fluorescein. For the Alexa568 receptors (acceptor), we compared fluorescence intensity with that of rhodamine-B in water, using the standard value of 0.70. Quantum yields of donor and acceptor bound to the secretin receptor were similar to those described earlier for analogous experiments with the cholecystokinin receptor (15Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Wessels W.S. Dawson E.S. Lybrand T.P. Prendergast F.G. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (quantum yield of 0.60 for donor and 0.68 for acceptor). J is the spectral overlap integral between donor emission (F(λ)) and acceptor absorbance (∈(λ)) spectra. It was calculated by the following: J =∫F(λ)∈(λ)λ4dλ/∫F(λ)dλ, where λ is the wavelength in cm, F(λ) is the normalized and integrated fluorescence of the donor at wavelength λ, and ∈(λ) is acceptor absorption in absorbance units at wavelength λ for the overlapping area. The efficiency of energy transfer (E) was calculated using the following equation based on the fluorescence intensity E = 1 - FDA/FD, where FDA and FD are the fluorescence intensities of the donor (Alexa488-ligand) in the presence and absence of the acceptor (Alexa568-secretin receptor), respectively. Corrected proximal distance is the 6th inverse power of the distance between donor and acceptor as noted in the equation, R = Ro((1 - E)/E)⅙ Å, where Ro is the distance between donor and acceptor with an efficiency of energy transfer of 50%. Molecular Modeling—All molecular modeling activities were conducted using a stochastic global energy optimization procedure implemented in internal coordinate mechanics (17Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. Kuznetsov D.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). This procedure consisted of the following iterative steps: (a) random conformational change of a dihedral angle according to the biased probability Monte Carlo method (18Abagyan R. Totrov M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar); (b) local minimization of all free dihedral angles; (c) acceptance or rejection of the new conformation based on the Metropolis criterion at the simulation temperature, usually at 600 K (19Metropolis N.R.A. Rosenbluth M.N. Teller A.H. Teller E. J. Chem. Phys. 1953; 21: 1087-1092Crossref Scopus (26657) Google Scholar). This procedure can generate and search through diverse sets of conformations by actively sampling a selected set of dihedral angles. All calculations were carried out on 3.4-GHz Intel XEON-EMT processors. Three series of molecular models of the rat secretin receptor were generated, each based on one of the distinct orientations between the amino-terminal and core transmembrane helical bundle domains proposed for receptors in this family (4Grace C.R. Perrin M.H. DiGruccio M.R. Miller C.L. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12836-12841Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 5Tan Y.V. Couvineau A.

In each of these, the amino-terminal and core domains of the secretin receptor represented homology models that we previously developed (6Dong M. Lam P.C. Gao F. Hosohata K. Pinon D.I. Sexton P.M. Abagyan R. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the amino terminus, we utilized the 20 NMR models of the mouse CRF2β receptor amino-terminal domain as template (6Dong M. Lam P.C. Gao F. Hosohata K. Pinon D.I. Sexton P.M. Abagyan R. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For each of the 20 resultant models, Cys11 was modified to Alexa568-labeled cysteine, and its side chain was sampled (illustrated in Fig. 1). The helical bundle reported in our previous study was also utilized (6Dong M. Lam P.C. Gao F. Hosohata K. Pinon D.I. Sexton P.M. Abagyan R. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The first, second, and the third extracellular loops were built and attached to the relevant helices after searching through the Protein Data Bank for suitable loop templates, followed by side chain sampling and backbone minimization. Cys186, Thr261, and Val346 of the three extracellular loops were modified to Alexa568-labeled cysteine, with their side chains further sampled as also illustrated in Fig. 1. In all models, a distance restraint was imposed between the carboxyl-terminal end of the amino-terminal domain and the amino-terminal end of transmembrane I. Each series of molecular models utilized a distinct spatial orientation of these two receptor domains as a"

Continuous signaling via Gαq in mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells impaired differentiation. Mice that expressed the constitutively active Gαq transgene in cells of the osteoblast lineage exhibited severe osteopenia in cortical and trabecular bones. Osteoblast number, bone volume, and trabecular thickness were reduced in transgenic mice, but the osteoclasts were unaffected. Osteoblasts from transgenic mice showed impaired differentiation and matrix formation. In the presence of a protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X, this impairment was not seen, indicating mediation by the protein kinase C pathway. We propose that continuous activation of the Gαq signal in osteoblasts plays a crucial, previously unrecognized role in bone formation.

G-proteins, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domains of membrane-embedded receptors, transduce extracellular signals that affect many biological actions. Although pathways regulated by G-proteins remain to be elucidated in bone cells, activation of several G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; αMEM, α-modified MEM; BMD, bone mineral density; CA, constitutively active; Col.1, type I collagen α1 chain; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin; OCN, osteocalcin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; PTH, parathyroid hormone; TG, transgenic-type; WT, wild-type; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; RT, reverse transcription; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum. 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; αMEM, α-modified MEM; BMD, bone mineral density; CA, constitutively active; Col.1, type I collagen α1 chain; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin; OCN, osteocalcin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; PTH, parathyroid hormone; TG, transgenic-type; WT, wild-type; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; RT, reverse transcription; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum. including those for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and prostaglandins, affects bone formation (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). A great deal has been learned concerning G-protein function in the skeleton and elsewhere from naturally occurring human mutations in Gαs (2Spiegel A.M. Horm. Res. 1997; 47: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Somatic Gαs mutations of key residues required to terminate GTPase are present in various endocrine tumors and fibrous dysplasia of bone, and in a more widespread distribution in patients with McCune-Albright syndrome, which is characterized by localized bone lesions termed polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cafe-aulait pigmentation of the skin, and autonomous hyperfunction of multiple endocrine organs. Substitution of Arg-201 of Gαs with either Cys or His causes the inhibition of the intrinsic GTPase activity, resulting in prolonged stimulation of adenylate cyclase and increased cAMP production in the affected tissues (3Spiegel A.M. Weinstein L.S. Shenker A. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 92: 1119-1125Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 4Weinstein L.S. Shenker A. Gejman P.V. Merino M.J. Friedman E. Spiegel A.M. N. Engl. J.

Heterozygous inactivating Gαs mutations lead to Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, a congenital syndrome in which patients develop obesity, short stature, brachydactyly, subcutaneous ossifications, and neurobehavioral deficits (5Weinstein L.S. Yu S. Warner D.R. Liu J. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 6Patten J.L. Johns D.R. Valle D. Eil C. Gruppuso P.A. Steele G. Smallwood P.M. Levine M.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1412-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Gαs is imprinted in a tissue-specific manner. Maternally inherited mutations lead to pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A, and paternally inherited mutations lead to Albright hereditary osteodystrophy alone, and pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B is almost always associated with a GNAS imprinting defect in which both alleles have a paternal specific imprinting pattern on both parental alleles. Moreover, mice with osteoblast-specific Gαs deficiency was generated recently, and this deficiency led to a defect in the formation of the primary spongiosa with reduced immature osteoid and thickened cortical bone with narrowing of the bone marrow cavity, implying a strong involvement of the Gαs signal in bone development (7Sakamoto A. Chen M. Nakamura T. Xie T. Karsenty G. Weinstein L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21369-21375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Gαq mutations have not been reported in human disease, perhaps because the functional redundancy of Gαq and Gα11 would compensate for a loss-of-function mutation, and little is known regarding the Gαq signaling role in bone cells. Although PKA is reported to be linked to many changes in gene expression directed by GPCRs in osteoblasts (8Quarles L.D. Siddhanti S.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the potential roles of PKC in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation are poorly understood.Our purpose here is to examine the role of the Gαq-mediated PKC signal in osteoblasts in vitro and in vivo. We first studied the effect of constitutively active Gαq signaling on osteoblast differentiation by overexpressing the epitope-tagged (HA), constitutively active mutant (Q209L) of the Gαq subunit (HA-CA-Gαq) (9Wu D.Q. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in vitro in osteoblastic cells. Next, to study the role of Gαq signaling in vivo, we produced mice that expressed a transgene encoding HA-CA-Gαq under the control of 2.3-kb type I collagen α1 chain (Col.1) promoter (10Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. Crombrugghe B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), thus limiting expression nearly exclusively to osteoblasts. This study demonstrated that Gαq-mediated activation of PKC in osteoblasts plays a crucial role in bone formation by inhibiting the differentiation of osteoblasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (αMEM), 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). In experiments assessing differentiation, medium was supplemented with β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid (Sigma). Fresh medium was added twice per week.Stable Transfection—MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 103 cells/cm2. After 24 h, these cells were transfected with the HA-tagged, constitutively active Gαq (MC3T3-E1-Gαq) cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or with the empty vector (MC3T3-E1-EV) using calcium phosphate precipitation. Replacing amino acids 125-130 in Gαq with part of the HA epitope does not interfere with its function (9Wu D.Q. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h, and every 48 h thereafter, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 200 μg/ml of hygromycin. By limiting dilution, more than 200 clones of MC3T3-E1-Gαq and more than 50 clones of MC3T3-E1-EV were established; clones were selected for further study based on measurement of total inositol phosphates as described previously (11Iida-Klein A. Guo J. Xie L.Y. Juppner H. Potts J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Bringhurst F.R. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8458-8465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Activity—MC3T3-E1-EV and MC3T3-E1-Gαq clones were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging from 3 to 21 days. At various intervals, the ALP activity in cell lysates was assessed in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 1.5 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol for 30 min at 37 °C using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. The release of p-nitrophenol was monitored by measuring absorbance at 405 nm.Generation of Transgenic (TG) Mice—A DNA fragment containing the 2.3-kb osteoblast-specific promoter region of the mouse Col.1 was inserted into KpnI/XbaI site of the intermediate vector to generate the final expression construct. The ends of this fragment were made blunt with Klenow polymerase and ligated to a blunt-ended BamHI site in the pcDNAI plasmid that contained a 1.1-kb cDNA fragment that encoded the entire coding sequence for HA epitope-tagged, constitutively active Gq protein α subunit (HA-Gαq) (9Wu D.Q. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction endonuclease digestions and nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed the correct orientation of the construct. The fragment from the final construct, including the 2.3-kb Col.1 promoter and HA-Gαq, was purified according to standard techniques and injected into the pronuclei of fertilized eggs from FVB/N mice by the Massachusetts General Hospital Transgenic Facility (Boston). Founder mice of the FVB/N strain were mated with WT mice to establish individual transgenic lines. The cDNA encoding for mouse HA-Gαq (Q209L) was provided by E. J. Neer (Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston). The 2.3-kb osteoblast-specific promoter region for the mouse Col.1 was provided by B. de Crombrugghe (The University of Texas, Houston). All mice were maintained according to the protocol approved by the institutional animal care committee.Screening for TG Mice by the PCR—To screen for TG animals, we performed PCR using TaqDNA polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and 100-200 ng of DNA prepared from mice tails using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. The PCR was performed for 40 cycles using the primer pairs encompassing nucleotides 397-421 (GACGTCCCCGACTACGCGGCAATAA) of the HA-Gαq cDNA, including an HA tag, and nucleotides 579-599 (TATTCGATGATCCCTGTAGTG) of the Gαq cDNA with the thermal cycle set at 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min.Transgene mRNA Expression—To investigate tissue-specific expression of the transgene, we reverse-transcribed total cellular RNA from mouse tissues and then performed PCR (RT-PCR). The reverse transcription reaction was performed with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers using 2 μg of total cellular RNA prepared with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Prior to the PCR, total cellular RNA was treated with DNase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. The reverse transcription reaction was performed using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers according to the manufacturer's directions. PCR was performed for 30 cycles using TaqDNA polymerase (Promega) and primer pairs encompassing nucleotides 397-421 (GACGTCCCCGACTACGCGGCAATAA) of the HA-Gαq cDNA, including an HA tag and nucleotides 579-599 (TATTCGATGATCCCTGTAGTG) of the Gαq cDNA with the thermal cycler set at 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. Control PCRs were performed for 30 cycles using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), 5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′ and 5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGC-3′, with the thermal cycler set at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were separated on 1.2% agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide.Serology—Serum was collected at 1 month of age for ionized calcium. Ionized calcium was measured by the 634 Ca2+/pH analyzer (Ciba-Corning Diagnostics Corp., Medfield, MA). Intact immunoreactive PTH was measured in duplicate using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Immutopics Inc., San Clemente, CA), which uses two affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies raised to peptides common to rat and mouse PTH.Analysis of Bone Morphology—Bone radiographs of the excised femora and tibiae from 8-week-old WT and TG mice were taken with a soft x-ray apparatus (type SRO-M50; Sofron, Tokyo, Japan). Three-dimensional computed tomography scans were reconstructed using a composite x-ray analyzing system (NS-ELEX, Tokyo, Japan). Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by single energy x-ray absorptiometry utilizing a bone mineral analyzer (DCS-600R, Aloka Co., Tokyo, Japan). For histological analyses, mice were killed at birth, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of age, and tibial and calvarial bone sections (5 μm) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m PBS, decalcified by 10% EDTA, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Collagen fiber deposition was assessed under polarized light in tibial and calvarial bone sections (5 μm) that had been fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m PBS, decalcified by 10% EDTA, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For the assessment of dynamic histomorphometric indices, mice were injected twice with calcein at a dose of 0.16 mg/10 g body weight and analyzed at 4 or 8 weeks of age. The 4-week group received dual injections 6 and 3 days before sacrifice, and the 8-week group received them 10 and 3 days before sacrifice. Long bones were fixed with ethanol, and the undecalcified bones were embedded in glycolmethacrylate. Three-μm longitudinal sections from the proximal tibiae and 20-μm cross-sections from mid-diaphyses of femora were stained with toluidine blue and analyzed using a semi-automated system (Osteoplan II; Zeiss). Parameters for trabecular bone were measured in an area 1.2 mm in length from 0.1 mm below the growth plate at the proximal metaphysis of the tibiae. Parameters for cortical bone were measured at the midshaft of the tibiae.In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridizations were performed as described (12Calvi L.M. Sims N.A. Hunzelman J.L. Knight M.C. Giovannetti A. Saxton J.M. Kronenberg H.M. Baron R. Schipani E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) using complementary 35S-labeled riboprobes (complementary RNAs and cRNAs) transcribed from the plasmids encoding human Col.1 and mouse osteocalcin.Ex Vivo Cell Cultures—Osteoblastic cells were isolated from calvariae of neonatal (1-2 days old) WT and TG mice as described previously (13Ogata N. Chikazu D. Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Tobe K. Azuma Y. Ohta T. Kadowaki T. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Calvariae were digested at 37 °C for 10 min in an enzyme solution containing 0.1% collagenase and 0.2% dispase in αMEM for five cycles, and cells isolated in the last four digestions were combined as osteoblastic cells. Bone marrow cells were collected from long bones of 8-week-old mice and were plated at a density of 106 cells on a 6-multiwell plate. Osteoblastic cells and marrow cells were cultured in αMEM containing 10% FBS, 50 mg/ml ascorbic acid, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. To assess mineralization, medium was supplemented with 10 nm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma). Fresh medium was added twice per week. To quantify cell proliferation, primary osteoblastic cells were inoculated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in a 24-multiwell plate, and cultured in the same medium for 3, 6, 9, and 12 days. [3H]Thymidine (1 mCi/ml of medium) was added for the final 3 h of incubation after 24 h of culture, and incorporation was measured. To measure ALP activity, primary osteoblastic cells were inoculated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in a 24-multiwell plate and cultured in the same medium in the absence or presence of PKC inhibitor, GF109203X (100 ng/ml) (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). After 14 days of culture, the cells were washed with PBS and sonicated in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.5% Triton X-100. ALP activity in the lysate was measured by the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol. The protein content was determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). For measurement of mineralized matrix formation and calcium deposition, primary osteoblastic cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 and cultured for 28 days. The formation of mineralized matrix nodules was assessed by Alizarin red staining, and the Alizarin red dye was eluted and measured spectrophotometrically to quantify calcium.Northern Blotting and RT-PCR—For Northern blot analysis, osteoblasts were incubated at a density of 2 × 104 cells per dish in 100-mm dishes and cultured in αMEM containing 10% FBS with 50 mg/ml ascorbic acid. Total RNA was extracted using a TRIzol kit (Invitrogen). Ten μg of total RNA was electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred onto nylon membrane filters (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences). cDNAs were labeled with [32P]dCTP by a random primed labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membranes were hybridized for 2 h at 68 °C with cDNA probes for mouse Runx2, Col.1, osteocalcin, RANKL, and osteoprotegerin, prepared from the plasmids described previously. The membranes were then washed and analyzed by a Cyclone PhosphorImager (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Control hybridization with G3PDH verified that equal amounts of RNA had been loaded. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed within the exponential amplification range to assess for expression of the transgene. Total mRNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed, and PCR was performed using specific primer pairs for transgene and G3PDH described above.Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Means of groups were compared by analysis of variance, and significance of differences was determined by post hoc testing using the Bonferroni method.RESULTSConstitutive Signaling by Gαq Inhibits Differentiation of MC3T3-E1 Cells—We initially evaluated whether expression of the constitutively active Gαq subunit affected proliferation and/or differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. MC3T3-E1 cells were chosen because they are “pre-osteoblasts”; specifically, they differentiate into mature osteoblasts and form mineralized nodules under a defined culture condition.We have established more than 200 MC3T3-E1 cell clones in total that stably overexpressed Gαq, and the range of increases in the protein level was 1.4-5.0-fold. Among them, three clones (Gαq clones -29, -135, and -155) with ∼2-fold higher Gαq protein expression were selected, because they also caused higher levels of PKC activity determined by the total inositol phosphate uptake than those of three control clones transfected with the empty vector (EV-1, -2, and -3) (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, most of the clones that expressed more than 3-fold of the Gαq protein neither showed higher uptake of total inositol phosphate nor did they grow well, resulting in abnormal morphological changes of cell shape (data not shown).Proliferation of the selected three MC3T3-E1-Gαq and the MC3T3-E1-EV cell lines was indistinguishable within each group and between groups, as assessed by counting cells at regular intervals; cell morphology also was not notably different (data not shown). However, the differentiation of the MC3T3-E1-Gαq cells determined by ALP activity was significantly lower during 21 days of culture (Fig. 1B), and a mineralized bone nodule formation determined by Alizarin red staining was also suppressed after 28 days (Fig. 1C), as compared with MC3T3-E1-EV clones. Additionally, mRNA levels of osteoblast differentiation markers Runx2, Col.1, and osteocalcin were lower in MC3T3-E1-Gαq clones than in MC3T3-E1-EV clones (Fig. 1D). Because the differences were more conspicuous at the earlier days than at 14 days, the Gαq-mediated signaling was likely to affect not only matrix formation by mature osteoblasts but also early stages of osteoblast differentiation.Generation of Mice Overexpressing Constitutively Active Gαq in Osteoblastic Cells—We then generated mice that express the constitutively active mutant of Gαq in cells of the osteoblast lineage, by controlling expression using the 2.3-kb proximal promoter of Col.1 gene (Fig. 2A). Independent transgenic lines were established from two male founders, and indistinguishable results were obtained from analyses of the progeny from both founder lines. Bone-specific expression of the transgene was confirmed by reverse transcription of total RNA, after it had been extracted from numerous tissues, followed by PCR using HA epitope-specific sense and Gαq antisense primers (Fig. 2B). A PCR product of the appropriate size was detected in bone extracts from TG mice, but none was detected either in extracts from other tissues from TG mice or any tissues from WT littermates (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Transgene construct and its expression. A, schematic representation of mouse Col.1 promoter-constitutively active Gαq transgene. Slashed box indicates the region of the entire coding of HA tag. The location of forward and reverse primers for RT-PCR is indicated by the arrows. B, RT-PCR product of the predicted size was detected only in total RNA extracted from bones of TG mice. The transgene was not detected in other tissues from TG mice nor in any tissues from the WT littermates. Control PCRs revealed a PCR product of the appropriate size in all tissues using the G3PDH primers. C, body weight (left) and tibial length (right) of WT and TG mice at indicated ages. Data are expressed as means (symbols) ± S.E. (error bars) for 10 mice/group/time. *, p < 0.01 versus WT mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)At birth, TG mice appeared normal, and their body weights and bone lengths were indistinguishable from WT littermates. Both males and females of the two transgenic lines showed qualitatively similar skeletal changes at all stages of postnatal development; however, the TG mice were smaller and had shorter limbs than WT littermates at 8 weeks and thereafter (Fig. 2C). Among 30 TG mice, tibial fracture was observed in nine mice as early as 2 weeks of age, although none in WT, indicating that the skeleton of TG mice was fragile. Craniofacial development and tooth eruption were normal in TG mice.Blood-ionized calcium concentration and intact PTH levels were comparable between WT and TG mice at 4 weeks of age (ionized Ca2+ (mm): WT mice, 1.26 ± 0.02, n = 10; TG mice, 1.28 ± 0.03, n = 10, p > 0.1 versus WT mice and PTH (pg/ml); WT mice, 35.3 ± 3.3, n = 10; TG mice, 34.2 ± 4.4, n = 10, p > 0.1 versus WT mice).Radiographic and Histological Skeletal Analyses—Long bones of WT and TG mice at birth were grossly indistinguishable as were the radiological and histological analyses of the physis, epiphysis, and diaphysis (data not shown). Also, at all ages examined, no difference was apparent in height or morphology of growth plate cartilage. Plain x-ray of long bones showed that TG mice at 8 weeks were proportionally shorter than WT mice and showed severe osteopenia (Fig. 3A). Three-dimensional femoral computed tomography analyses demonstrated thinner cortices and fewer trabeculae in TG mice compared with WT littermates, indicating that both cortical and trabecular bone were affected (Fig. 3A). BMDs of the entire femur and tibia of TG mice were significantly lower than those of WT mice at 4 and 8 weeks of age (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Radiological and histological findings of the long bones in WT and TG mice littermates. A, plain x-ray of whole femora and tibiae, and three-dimensional computed tomography reconstructed images of the distal femora of representative 8-week-old WT and TG male littermates. B, BMD of the femora and tibiae of WT and TG littermates at 4 and 8 weeks of age. Data are expressed as mean (bars) ± S.E. (error bars) for five mice/group/time. *, p < 0.01 versus WT mice. C, longitudinal decalcified sections through the proximal tibia of 2- or 4-week-old WT and TG mice and decalcified sections of cortical bone from tibial mid-diaphysis of 4-week-old WT and TG mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE; scale bar, 100 μm (proximal tibiae of 2-week-old mice), 200 μm (proximal tibiae of 4-week-old mice), and 20 μm (cortical bone)). Inset boxes indicate the region of the row below (HE; scale bar, 10 μm. Arrows and arrowheads indicate osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively.). Collagen fiber deposition was assessed under polarized microscopy in cortical bone sections (scale bar, 20 μm). Sections of undecalcified proximal tibia of 8-week-old WT and TG mice were stained by toluidine blue (TB; scale bar, 400 μm). Data of histomorphometric analyses are shown in Fig. 4. Sections shown are representative of those obtained from six mice in each group. D, in situ hybridization with the 35S-labeled type I collagen (Col.1) and OCN cRNAs in sections of decalcified proximal tibia (scale bar, 200 μm) and tibial cortex (scale bar, 20 μm), respectively, from 2-week-old WT and TG mice. The bright field sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. Representative images were selected from 10 to 12 mice/genotype, which showed consistent results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)By histological examination of the proximal tibiae, osteopenia began to be detected in TG mice at 2 weeks of age, which became evident at 4 weeks with decreases in both cortical thickness and trabecular number, as compared with WT littermates (Fig. 3C). In addition to being thinner, a polarized microscopic image of the TG cortical bone revealed that the extracellular matrix was more disorganized, suggesting a woven bone pattern, than the WT matrix with lamellar distribution. Marrow fibrosis that can sometimes accompany woven bone (14Weinstein, L. S. in Principles of Bone Biology (Bilezikian, J., Raisz, L., and Rodan, G., eds), 2nd Ed., pp. 877-888, Academic Press, San DiegoGoogle Scholar), however, was not detected in the marrow cavity of TG mice. The decreases in cortical and trabecular bone volumes were still evident without widening of osteoid seams at 8 weeks in TG mice, as shown in the toluidine blue staining (Fig. 3C). We further examined the in vivo expressions of Col.1 and osteocalcin by in situ hybridization at 2 weeks of age when osteopenia became detectable. The expressions were decreased in trabecular and cortical bones of TG mice (Fig. 3D).Bone Histomorphometric Analyses—Bone histomorphometric measurements of trabecular bones from mice of 4 and 8 weeks of age showed that parameters of bone formation, bone volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), osteoblast number (Ob.S/BS), and osteoid surface (OS/BS), were markedly reduced in TG mice at both ages, whereas parameters of bone resorption (number of mature osteoclasts (Oc.N/B.Pm), percentage of bone surface covered by mature osteoclasts (Oc.S/BS), percentage of eroded surface (ES/BS)) were not significantly different (Fig. 4A). Cortical thickness (Ct.Th) at the midshaft of tibiae was also decreased in TG mice at both ages.FIGURE 4Histomorphometric analyses of trabecular and cortical bones. A, static parameters of trabecular bones from 0.1 to 1.2 mm below the growth plate of the proximal tibiae metaphysis were compared between 4- and 8-week-old WT and TG mice. BV/TV, trabecular bone volume as a percentage of total volume; Tb.Th, trabecular thickness; Ob.S/BS, percentage of the bone surface covered by cuboidal osteoblasts; OS/BS, percentage of the bone surface covered with osteoid; Oc.N/B.Pm, number of mature osteoclasts in 10 cm of the bone perimeter; Oc.S/BS, percentage of bone surface covered by mature osteoclasts; ES/BS, percentage of eroded surface. Cortical thickness (Ct. Th) was also compared at the midshaft of tibiae. B, dynamic parameters of bone formation in trabecular bone. Tibial mineralization fronts of 4-week-old WT and TG mice were imaged by fluorescent microscopy, after labeling with calcein at days 3 and 6 (scale bar, 50 μm), and longitudinal sections from proximal parts of tibiae of WT and TG mice at 4 and 8 weeks of age were used for measurement of mineral apposition rate (MAR), bone formation rate (BFR), and mineralization lag time (MLT).

In this study, we found that CD31bright cells have a strong ability to release cytokines. The mixture of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thrombopoietin (TPO), and stem cell factor stimulated ex vivo expansion of the total cell number from cultured AC133+ cells of adult peripheral blood cells and cord blood cells, resulting in incrementation of the adhesion cells, in which endothelial nitric oxide synthase and kinase insert domain-containing receptor were positive. Moreover, the mixture of VEGF and TPO increased the CD31bright cell population when compared with VEGF alone or the mixture of VEGF and stem cell factor. These data suggest that TPO is an important growth factor that can promote endothelial precursor cells expansion ex vivo.

Neovascularization is an important adaptation to rescue tissue from critical ischemia. Postnatal blood vessel formation was formerly thought to be primarily due to the migration and proliferation of preexisting, fully differentiated endothelial cells, a process referred to as angiogenesis.

Physiol. 2003; 195: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we isolated AC133+ cells and examined their endothelial differentiation in vitro. CD31(PECAM-1)+ and CD31bright cells appeared at an early stage of the in vitro differentiation of AC133+ cells, and CD31bright cells derived from AC133+ cells were identified as the precursors of endothelial cells because CD31bright cells had differentiated more efficiently to endothelial cells than others. Therefore, we conclude that CD31bright cells derived from AC133+ cells possess the typical character of EPCs. In this study, we analyzed the effects of TPO on the appearance of CD31bright cells from AC133+ cells, and we show that TPO plays an important role in in vitro EPC expansion. Reagents—Recombinant TPO and recombinant stem cell factor (SCF) were kindly provided by Kirin-Amgen Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA). Recombinant human VEGF was purchased from Strathmann Biotec AG (Hamburg, Germany). The AC133 magnetic cell sorting kit and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD133/2 antibody were from Miltenyi Biotec (Gladbach, Germany). Allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD110 (TPO receptor) antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD31 monoclonal antibody, FITC-conjugated anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody, and anti-STAT3 monoclonal antibody were from Pharmingen. Phycoerythrin-conjugated vascular endothelial cadherin (VEcad/CD144) antibody was from Beckman Coulter (Marseilles, France). Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (Flk-1/KDR) monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-human endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) were obtained. Anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody, anti-Akt antibody, and anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705) antibody were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Fibronectin (FN)- and type IV collagen-coated dishes were purchased from Iwaki Co., Tokyo, Japan. Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD14 antibody was from DakoCytomation (Glostrup, Denmark). Preparation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells—Human cord blood was kindly supplied by the Metro Tokyo Red Cross Cord Blood Bank (Tokyo, Japan) with informed consent. The buffy coat fraction was prepared from voluntary donated human blood of Saitama Red Cross of Japan (Saitama, Japan). The blood sample was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mm EDTA and was loaded on a Lymphoprep™ tube (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo Norway) (density = 1.077). After being centrifuged for 20 min 800 × g at 18 °C, mononuclear cells were collected and washed with sorting solution (PBS supplemented with 2 mm EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin). Flow Cytometric Analysis of AC133 and CD34 Expression in Mononuclear Cells—To eliminate the dead cells, dead cells were stained with 7-amino actinomycin D. Mononuclear cells were labeled with PE-conjugated anti-AC133 monoclonal antibody and FITC-conjugated anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody simultaneously at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing with the sorting solution, flow cytometric analysis was performed with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Magnetic Cell Sorting of AC133+Cells—Mononuclear cells were labeled with magnetic bead-conjugated anti-AC133 antibodies according to the protocol directed by the manufacturer. After the brief wash with the sorting solution, the cells were separated by a magnetic cell separator (autoMACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Gladbach, Germany), and the positive cells were then collected. Culture of AC133+Cells—Isolated AC133+ cells were cultured in EBM-2 (Cambrex Corp., East Rutherford, NJ) medium containing 20% heat-inactivated FBS and 30 mg/liter kanamycin sulfate at 37 °C under moisturized air containing 5% CO2 with 50 ng/ml VEGF as control medium. Control medium containing VEGF was added with TPO, SCF, or both. Cells were plated on FN- or type IV collagen-coated dishes at a cell density of ∼106 cells/ml. We have previously shown that EPCs can tightly adhere to an FN-coated dish but weakly to type IV collagen-coated dish (25Kanayasu-Toyoda T. Yamaguchi T. Oshizawa T. Hayakawa T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Analysis of adherent EPCs was performed on FN-coated dish and that of suspended EPCs on type IV collagen-coated dish. Half of the medium was exchanged once every 3–4 days with fresh medium. Adherent cells on FN-coated dish were fixed with ethanol chilled to -20 °C and then subsequently subjected to an immunostaining procedure or other treatments. Cells on type IV collagen-coated dish were subsequently subjected to flow cytometric analysis. Immunostaining of Adherent Cells—After fixation with chilled ethanol (-20 °C), the cell layer was washed three times with PBS. Cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (-) for 1 h at 4 °C for blocking and then with each first antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (-) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and then examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission of 530/30 nm for FITC or 570/30 nm for rhodamine. In every experiment, we used nonspecific immunoglobulin corresponding to the first antibody species as a control and confirmed that the cells were not stained with control immunoglobulin. The fluorescence intensity of 20 randomly selected cells was calculated using the Scion Image program within the linear range for quantitation. Analysis of Cytokines in the Supernatant of CD31bright and CD31+Cells—The expression of CD31 on cultured AC133+ cells was determined with a flow cytometer. After AC133+ cells were cultured for several days on either FN-coated or collagen type IV-coated dishes, both adherent and nonadherent cells were collected. The collected cells were labeled with FITC-labeled anti-CD31 antibody for 15 min at 4 °C. After a brief wash with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS, flow cytometric analysis was performed. CD31bright and CD31+ cells were sorted from cultured AC133+ cells with FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells of both populations were subsequently cultured in EBM-2 supplemented with 20% FBS in the absence of any cytokines. After 5 days, the collected supernatant of cells was frozen at -20 °C. Cytokines were measured by a BD™ cytometric beads array Flex set system (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Various Cell Surface Markers in Cultured AC133+Cells—After AC133+ cells were cultured for the indicated period, cells were co-stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD31 antibody and PE-labeled anti-CD14 antibody or PE-labeled VEcad antibody. Cells were also stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD31 antibody, allophycocyanin-labeled anti-CD110 antibody, and PE-labeled anti-AC133 antibody triply and then subjected to flow cytometry. Dead cells were eliminated by staining with 7-amino actinomycin D. Calculation of the Absolute Number of CD31bright Cells—The absolute number of CD31bright cells was multiplied by the total cell number of each well, and the ratio of CD31bright cells was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting—After cell sorting, AC133+ cells were suspended in 20% FBS-EBM2 and cultured for 3 days in the presence of VEGF and TPO. Cells were collected and incubated in 2% FBS-EBM2 for 1 h. Cells were stimulated by 50 ng/ml TPO, 50 ng/ml VEGF, or both for 15 min. Cells (1 × 106) were collected and lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, along with 1/100 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1/100 (v/v) phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cellular lysate of 5 × 105 cells/lane was subjected to Western blotting analysis. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired Studentŉs t test, and the dose response of TPO was compared between the four groups by one-way analysis of variance and the Tukey test using Prism 4 software. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Each experiment was repeated three times, and the representative data are indicated. We previously reported that during the in vitro differentiation of peripheral blood AC133+ cells into the endothelial cells, the expression of CD31 was the earliest marker among all of the tested markers (25Kanayasu-Toyoda T. Yamaguchi T. Oshizawa T. Hayakawa T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, by analyzing the ability of differentiation into endothelial cells, CD31bright cells were shown to exhibit EPC character when compared with the CD31+ fraction. Since cord blood is a rich source of blood stem cells such as CD34+ and AC133+ cells, it is expected to be a useful source for CD31bright cells. At first, we attempted to determine whether the CD31bright fraction derived from cord blood AC133+ cells contained EPCs. As shown in Fig. 1A, the populations of AC133+ CD34- cells, AC133- CD34+ cells, and AC133+ CD34+ cells in cord blood were approximately four times greater than those in peripheral blood (Fig. 1A). After 5 days of cultivation of AC133+ cells on an FN-coated dish, adherent CD31-positive cells were observed (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Analysis of the fluorescence intensity of CD31-positive cells revealed that the average fluorescence intensity in CD31+ cells was highest on day 5 (Fig. 1B, lower panel), corresponding to the results of peripheral blood cells. After 1 week of cultivation of AC133+ cells on a collagen type IV-coated dish, on which cells adhered more loosely when compared with the FN-coated dish, cells were collected and sorted into CD31+ and CD31bright fractions, as shown in Fig. 1C, panel a, and both cell types were cultured on an FN-coated dish for 1 week after the sorting. The number of cells adhering and spreading was higher in the CD31bright fraction (Fig. 1C, panel c) than in the CD31+ fraction (Fig. 1C, panel b), and these adhering cells are apparently KDR- (Fig. 1C, panel d) and eNOS-positive (Fig. 1C, panel e). The large areas of intense green fluorescence represent the colonies of CD31bright cells. These data indicate that CD31bright cells derived from AC133+ cells of both peripheral blood and cord blood are EPCs. Several reports have shown that EPCs produce cytokines (9Rehman J. Li J. Orschell C.M. March K.L. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1164-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar, 26Hur J. Yoon C.H. Kim H.S. Choi J.H. Kang H.J. Hwang K.K. Oh B.H. Lee M.M. Park Y.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar, 27Yoon C.H. Hur J. Park K.W. Kim J.H. Lee C.S. Oh I.Y. Kim T.Y. Cho H.J. Kang H.J. Chae I.H. Yang H.K. Oh B.H. Park Y.B. Kim H.S. Circulation. 2005; 112: 1618-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), but the ability of CD31+ or CD31bright cells derived from AC133+ cells to produce cytokines is not known. After cell sorting, quantitative analysis of cytokines released by CD31+ cells and CD31bright cells was carried out at 5 days after the cultivation. As shown in Fig. 2, IL-8 was markedly produced by CD31bright cells from both peripheral blood and cord blood when compared with CD31+ cells. The production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) by CD31bright cells was also higher than that of CD31+ cells. The production of VEGF was higher by CD31bright cells than by CD31+ cells but not significantly. The production of all cytokines by CD31bright cells from peripheral blood was higher than that from cord blood. Tumor necrosis factor-α, GM-CSF, and G-CSF were hardly produced by CD31bright and CD31+ cells. These data indicate that CD31bright cells derived from AC133+ cells have a strong ability to produce chemokines. It has been reported that TPO and SCF are potent stimulators of multipotent cell proliferation (17Fox N. Priestley G. Papayannopoulou T. Kaushansky K. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Sitnicka E. Lin N. Priestley G.V. Fox N. Broudy V.C. Wolf N.S. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1996; 87: 4998-5005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, the effects of both growth factors on EPC growth and differentiation in our culture system were determined. After the addition of both TPO and SCF for 2 weeks, the expression of eNOS and KDR in adhered cells was analyzed (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3A clearly indicates that AC133+ cells from both peripheral blood and cord blood differentiate into eNOS+ and KDR+ cells more efficiently in the presence of the mixture of TPO, SCF, and VEGF than of VEGF alone. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the ratio of CD31bright CD14- cells increased in the presence of the mixture of TPO, SCF, and VEGF when AC133+ cells were cultured on collagen type IV-coated dish for 1 week (Fig. 3B). We next examined which growth factor is dominant in the induction and proliferation of CD31bright cells. The total cell number of cultured AC133+ cells from both peripheral blood (Fig. 4A, upper panel) and cord blood (Fig. 4A, lower panel) significantly increased in the presence of TPO, SCF, or both growth factors when compared with that of VEGF alone during a 1-week period. As shown in Fig. 4B, however, the increment in the ratio of the CD31bright cell population was observed only in the presence of TPO. The absolute number of CD31bright cells, calculated by the total cell number and the ratio of the CD31bright cell population, was markedly increased by TPO (Fig. 4C). In contrast, SCF induced the increase in total cell number to the same level as TPO (Fig. 4A), but it did not induce the increase in either the ratio of the CD31bright cell population (Fig. 4B) or the number of CD31bright cells (Fig. 4C). Next, we examined whether TPO and VEGF can synergistically affect the induction of CD31bright cells during a 1-week cultivation. As shown in Fig. 4D, although VEGF had no effects on the total cell number (Fig. 4D, panel a), it increased the ratio of the CD31bright cell population to 1.4-fold higher than that of the control (Fig. 4D, panel b), resulting in a slight increase in the number of CD31bright cells (Fig. 4D, panel c). Thrombopoietin alone induced an increase in not only the total cell number (Fig. 4D, panel a) but also the ratio of the CD31bright cell population (Fig. 4D, panel b), resulting in an ∼24-fold increment of the absolute number of CD31bright cells when compared with the control (Fig. 4D, panel c). The concomitant treatment with both VEGF and TPO showed a synergic increase in the number of CD31bright cells (Fig. 4D, panel c). When AC133+ cells were cultured with various concentrations of TPO in the presence of constant concentrations of VEGF (50 ng/ml), the total cell number from both peripheral blood (Fig. 5A, upper panel) and cord blood (Fig. 5A, lower panel) significantly increased at 5 ng/ml of TPO when compared with the control, and there was no significant difference in the total cell number from 5 to 50 ng/ml of TPO. However, TPO increased the ratio of CD31bright cells of flow cytometry dose-dependently as follows: control, 0.50%; 5 ng/ml, 1.36%; 10 ng, 1.42%; 50 ng/ml 1.90% in peripheral blood and control, 1.16%; 5 ng/ml, 1.99%; 10 ng, 2.51%; 50 ng/ml 2.96% in cord blood. TPO markedly induced the differentiation of AC133+ cells into CD31brightVEcad+ cells in the case of both peripheral blood (Fig. 5B, upper panel) and cord blood (Fig. 5B, lower panel) in a dose-dependent manner. In the case of cord blood cells, differentiation into CD31brightVEcad- cells was also induced by TPO. The effects of TPO on total cell number during 6-day culture of AC133+ cells were determined. Although the total cell number from AC133+ cells slightly and constantly increased from day 0 to day 6 in the absence of TPO, total cells markedly increased after the third day in the presence of TPO (Fig. 6A). Next, the alternation of TPO receptor (CD110) expression was analyzed during the cultivation of AC133+ cells. Although the percentages of both AC133+ CD110+ cells and CD31+ CD110+ cells were 0% just after magnetic cell sorting, 3 days after the cultivation, ∼2% of CD31+ CD110+ cells (Fig. 6B, left panel) and 1% of AC133+ CD110+ cells (Fig. 6B, right panel) appeared from AC133+ cells in the peripheral blood and cord blood, respectively. These data indicate the possibility that sorted AC133+ cells may differentiate into AC133+ CD110+ cells and may subsequently proliferate and differentiate into EPCs in response to TPO. It has been reported that TPO activates the PI3K/Akt pathway (28Miyakawa Y. Rojnuckarin P. Habib T. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2494-2502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or JAK/STAT pathway (20Brizzi M.F. Battaglia E. Montrucchio G. Dentelli P. Del Sorbo L. Garbarino G. Pegoraro L. Camussi G. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8329-8337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in target cells. In addition, in the present study, TPO induced a marked proliferation of AC133+ cells after 3-day culture, and CD110 expression in cells cultured for 3 days from both cord blood and peripheral blood was also observed (Fig. 6, A and B). We then attempted to determine whether TPO activates Akt or STAT in AC133+ cells cultured for 3 days by analyzing the phosphorylation at Ser-473 of Akt or the phosphorylation at Tyr-705 of STAT3, which are the active forms of Akt or STAT3, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7A, phosphorylation at Ser-473 of Akt was stimulated by both VEGF and TPO at 15 min and was more markedly stimulated by concomitant treatment with VEGF and TPO than by a single treatment (Fig. 7A, top panel). Phosphorylation at Tyr-705 of STAT3 was observed only in the presence of TPO, and unlike in the phosphorylation at Ser-473 of Akt, an increased amount of phosphorylation was not observed in the concomitant presence of VEGF and TPO (Fig. 7A, third panel). On the other hand, there was no difference in the expression of Akt and STAT3 protein levels (Fig. 7A, second panel and bottom panel, respectively). The induction of CD31bright cells was not perfectly but significantly inhibited by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays an important role in TPO-induced EPC differentiation (Fig. 7B). We have previously reported that CD31bright cells derived from AC133+ cells in human peripheral blood are EPCs (25Kanayasu-Toyoda T. Yamaguchi T. Oshizawa T. Hayakawa T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study, CD31bright cells also appeared from AC133+ cells prepared from cord blood, which are a rich source of stem cells during the early period of cultivation (Fig. 1, A and B). When cells were separated in terms of CD31 expression (Fig. 1C), CD31bright cells differentiated into KDR-positive and eNOS-positive adherent cells. These data indicate that CD31bright cells derived from AC133+ cells in cord blood have some characteristics similar to those of EPCs in peripheral blood. Although these EPCs in both cord blood and peripheral blood could not form tube-like structure by themselves on Matrigel (data not shown), they secreted angiogenic growth factors (Fig. 2) such as VEGF, IL-8 (31Li A.

Oppenheim J.J. Murphy W.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 34-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that there are at least two types of EPCs: early EPCs and late EPCs. Early EPCs are unable to form tube-like structures and secrete VEGF and IL-8 showing peak growth at 2–3 weeks (9Rehman J. Li J. Orschell C.M. March K.L.

Circulation. 2005; 112: 1618-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Late EPCs with the ability to proliferate and having a cobblestone shape appear late at 2–3 weeks, show exponential growth at 4–8 weeks, and have the ability to form tube-like structures (26Hur J. Yoon C.H. Kim H.S. Choi J.H. Kang H.J. Hwang K.K. Oh B.H. Lee M.M. Park Y.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar, 27Yoon C.H. Hur J.

Circulation. 2001; 103: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar), because the origin of early EPCs was CD14+ cells or was not precluded by monocytic cells, CD14 expression was still observed in the EPCs after cultivation. In our study, in which AC133+ cells were used as the origin of the EPCs, CD14 expression was not observed in CD31bright cells induced by TPO (Fig. 3B). Although the CD31bright cells identified as EPCs in this report and in a previous report did not correspond to their cells in terms of the origin of the cells or cell surface markers, these cells may be early EPCs that can release potent proangiogenic growth factors (Fig. 2). In any event, EPCs are thought to be a heterogeneous population, unlike late EPCs, which have a high ability to proliferate. Circulating EPCs are up-regulated under physiological or pathological conditions and also by 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (14Dimmeler S. Aicher A. Vasa M. Mildner-Rihm C.

In this report, we have revealed the possibility of marked expansion of EPCs in vitro by TPO. Brizzi et al. (20Brizzi M.F. Battaglia E. Montrucchio G. Dentelli P. Del Sorbo L. Garbarino G. Pegoraro L. Camussi G. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have reported that TPO directly stimulates endothelial cell motility and neoangiogenesis. In the present study, TPO may have played a stimulatory role in the differentiation of EPCs from circulating stem cells. Although both TPO and SCF have the same potency with regard to proliferation of AC133+ cells (Fig. 4A), TPO specifically induces an increase in the ratio of the CD31bright cell population when compared with SCF (Fig. 4, B and C). To develop useful cell therapy products for severe ischemia, it has been considered desirable to establish the efficient expansion of EPCs in vitro. Thrombopoietin could increase CD31bright cells (EPCs) even in the absence of VEGF. Kirito et al. (38Kirito K. Fox N. Komatsu N. Kaushansky K. Blood. 2005; 105: 4258-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have reported that TPO enhances expression of VEGF in hematopoietic cells through induction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α. These observations suggest the possibility that the production of EPCs by TPO may be supported by VEGF produced by AC133+ cells. However, from the perspective that TPO and VEGF have synergistic effects on the induction of EPCs, TPO seems to induce EPCs through another signaling cascade. Thrombopoietin is a major regulator of the proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of megakaryocytes (39Kelemen E. Cserhati I. Tanos B. Acta Haematol. (Basel). 1958; 20: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 40Yamamoto S. Acta Haematol. Jpn. 1957; 20: 163Google Scholar). The results from recent studies suggest that TPO can act not only as a lineage-specific hematopoietic growth factor but also can affect other hematopoietic cell types. For example, TPO alone does not induce proliferation of long term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells. However, in combination with SCF or IL-3, TPO has several synergistic effects on cell proliferation (19Sitnicka E. Lin N. Priestley G.V. Fox N. Broudy V.C. Wolf N.S. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1996; 87: 4998-5005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results have revealed a new role of TPO in the production of EPCs. In the process of differentiation of AC133+ cells into CD31bright cells, both peripheral blood and cord blood appear to be very similar. AC133+ cells of cord blood, however, have a stronger ability to proliferate than those of peripheral blood (Fig. 6A). Moreover, TPO stimulates the induction of CD31brightVEcad- cells only from cord blood (Fig. 5B) at high concentrations. Hur et al. (26Hur J. Yoon C.H. Kim H.S. Choi J.H. Kang H.J. Hwang K.K. Oh B.H. Lee M.M. Park Y.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) have reported that VEcad- EPCs are thought to be an early EPC. It is therefore thought that AC133+ cells of cord blood are more immature than those of peripheral blood. Although the total cell number treated with TPO slightly increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A), the CD31bright cell number markedly increased as the TPO concentration increased (Fig. 5B). These data suggest the possibility that a higher concentration of TPO may be needed for CD31bright cell induction from AC133+ cells. When AC133+ cells were stimulated by TPO or VEGF, an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 was observed. This increase was strongly enhanced by concomitant treatment with VEGF and TPO (Fig. 7A). The induction of CD31bright cells by these growth factors (Fig. 4D) was consistent with the increase in the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473. TPO but not VEGF could also stimulate the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr-705. We previously reported that the PI3K/p70 S6 kinase pathway and the JAK/STAT3 pathway were important for proliferation and differentiation, respectively, in neutrophilic differentiation (41Kanayasu-Toyoda T. Yamaguchi T. Uchida E. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25471-25480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42Yamaguchi T. Mukasa T. Uchida E. Kanayasu-Toyoda T. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15575-15581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Owing to the stimulation of both the PI3K/Akt and the JAK/STAT pathways, we postulated that TPO may be a stronger stimulator of EPC production than VEGF. As shown in Fig. 7B, however, wortmannin could not completely inhibit the induction of CD31bright cells. Therefore, a pathway other than the PI3K/Akt pathway may also work for the proliferation and differentiation of EPCs. The observation of unfavorable angiogenesis has recently been reported after transplantation of bone marrow mononuclear cells in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (43Miyamoto K. Nishigami K. Nagaya N. Akutsu K. Chiku M. Kamei M. Soma T. Miyata S. Higashi M. Tanaka R. Nakatani T. Nonogi H. Takeshita S. Circulation. 2006; 114: 2679-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, transfer of both spleen cell-derived EPCs and bone marrow mononuclear cells accelerate atherosclerosis in apoE knockout mice, whereas EPC transfer reduces markers associated with plaque stability (44George J. Afek A. Abashidze A. Shmilovich H. Deutsch V. Kopolovich J. Miller H. Keren G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2636-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that transplantation of differentiated cells from EPCs may be useful therapy as regenerative medicine. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new role of TPO in enhancing the differentiation of AC133+ cells into CD31bright cells (EPCs) in vitro. These findings may contribute to further development of cell therapy for critical ischemia.
