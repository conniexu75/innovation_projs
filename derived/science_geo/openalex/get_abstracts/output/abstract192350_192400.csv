Eleven subjects in one series of 16 experiments were permitted to sleep uninterruptedly thronghout the night. The mean duration of sleep was 7 hr. The first appearance of a pattern of rapid, jerky eye movements was from 1 hr 40 min to 4 hr 50 min (3 hr 14 min, mean) after going to bed. This pattern of eye motility was of variable duration and :frequently disappeared for a fraction of a minute or for several minutes only to reappear and disappear a number of times. The period from the onset of the first recog­ nizable pattern to the disappearance of the last pat­ tern was from 6 to 53 min with a mean of 20 min. A second period of eye movement patterns appeared from 1 hr 10 min to 3' hr 50 min (2 hr 16' min, mean) after the onset of the :first f!Ye motility period. With lengthier sleep there occurred a third and, rarely, a fourth such period. The electrooculogram disclosed vivid potentials with amplitudes as high as 30()-400 !lov, each potential lasting about 1 sec. This was fur­ ther striking in comparison with simultaneously re­ corded monopolar EEG's, from the frontal and oc­ cipital areas, which were invariably of low amplitude (5-30 !lov) and irregular frequeney (15-20jsec and 5-8jsec predominating). In another series of experiments involving 14 sub­ jects, the respiratory rate was calculated for a mini­ ~um of % min during eye motility and compared with the rate for a similar duration 15 min before and after an eye motility period. The respiratory rate had , a mean of 16.9jmin during eye motility in eontrast with 13.4jmin during ocular quiescence. By using Fisher's Ii method, the dijIerence in rates was found to be statistically significant with a probability of less than OJJ01. Experiments now in progress snggest that heart rate also is probably higher in the presence of these eye movements. Body motility records were secured, in 6 experiments- by attaching, a sensitive crystal to the bed spring and leading the output through a resistance to a Grass preamplifier. In every ease the eye motility periods were associated with peaks of overt bodily activity although the latter were frequently present in the absence of eye movments. Data obtained from the 2 female subjects used in these experiments were at least qualitatively similar to that obtained from males. The fact that these eye movements, EEG pattern, and autonomic nervous system activity are signifi­ eantly related and do not occur randomly suggests that these physiological phenomena, and probably dreaming, are very likely all manifestations of a particular level of cortical activity which is en­ countered normally during sleep.
