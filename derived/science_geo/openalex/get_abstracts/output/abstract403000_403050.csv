https://openalex.org/W1980789245,"Microglia are highly motile phagocytic cells that infiltrate and take up residence in the developing brain, where they are thought to provide a surveillance and scavenging function. However, although microglia have been shown to engulf and clear damaged cellular debris after brain insult, it remains less clear what role microglia play in the uninjured brain. Here, we show that microglia actively engulf synaptic material and play a major role in synaptic pruning during postnatal development in mice. These findings link microglia surveillance to synaptic maturation and suggest that deficits in microglia function may contribute to synaptic abnormalities seen in some neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1997453048,"5-methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA plays an important role in gene expression, genomic imprinting, and suppression of transposable elements. 5mC can be converted to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by the Tet (ten eleven translocation) proteins. Here, we show that, in addition to 5hmC, the Tet proteins can generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) from 5mC in an enzymatic activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, we reveal the presence of 5fC and 5caC in genomic DNA of mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse organs. The genomic content of 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC can be increased or reduced through overexpression or depletion of Tet proteins. Thus, we identify two previously unknown cytosine derivatives in genomic DNA as the products of Tet proteins. Our study raises the possibility that DNA demethylation may occur through Tet-catalyzed oxidation followed by decarboxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1988929438,"The seminal importance of DNA sequencing to the life sciences, biotechnology and medicine has driven the search for more scalable and lower-cost solutions. Here we describe a DNA sequencing technology in which scalable, low-cost semiconductor manufacturing techniques are used to make an integrated circuit able to directly perform non-optical DNA sequencing of genomes. Sequence data are obtained by directly sensing the ions produced by template-directed DNA polymerase synthesis using all-natural nucleotides on this massively parallel semiconductor-sensing device or ion chip. The ion chip contains ion-sensitive, field-effect transistor-based sensors in perfect register with 1.2 million wells, which provide confinement and allow parallel, simultaneous detection of independent sequencing reactions. Use of the most widely used technology for constructing integrated circuits, the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, allows for low-cost, large-scale production and scaling of the device to higher densities and larger array sizes. We show the performance of the system by sequencing three bacterial genomes, its robustness and scalability by producing ion chips with up to 10 times as many sensors and sequencing a human genome. Progress towards cheaper and more compact DNA sequencing devices is limited by a number of factors, including the need for imaging technology. A new DNA sequencing technology that does away with optical readout, instead gathering sequence data by directly sensing hydrogen ions produced by template-directed DNA synthesis, offers a route to low cost and scalable sequencing on a massively parallel semiconductor-sensing device or ion chip. The reactions are performed using all natural nucleotides, and the individual ion-sensitive chips are disposable and inexpensive. The system has been used to sequence three bacterial genomes and a human genome: that of Gordon Moore of Moore's law fame."

https://openalex.org/W2125832470,"Peptidoglycan is the major structural constituent of the bacterial cell wall, forming a meshwork outside the cytoplasmic membrane that maintains cell shape and prevents lysis. In Gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycan is located in the periplasm, where it is protected from exogenous lytic enzymes by the outer membrane. Here we show that the type VI secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa breaches this barrier to deliver two effector proteins, Tse1 and Tse3, to the periplasm of recipient cells. In this compartment, the effectors hydrolyse peptidoglycan, thereby providing a fitness advantage for P. aeruginosa cells in competition with other bacteria. To protect itself from lysis by Tse1 and Tse3, P. aeruginosa uses specific periplasmically localized immunity proteins. The requirement for these immunity proteins depends on intercellular self-intoxication through an active type VI secretion system, indicating a mechanism for export whereby effectors do not access donor cell periplasm in transit."
https://openalex.org/W2065857896,"Magnetism plays a key role in modern technology as essential building block of many devices used in daily life. Rich future prospects connected to spintronics, next generation storage devices or superconductivity make it a highly dynamical field of research. Despite those ongoing efforts, the many-body dynamics of complex magnetism is far from being well understood on a fundamental level. Especially the study of geometrically frustrated configurations is challenging both theoretically and experimentally. Here we present the first realization of a large scale quantum simulator for magnetism including frustration. We use the motional degrees of freedom of atoms to comprehensively simulate a magnetic system in a triangular lattice. Via a specific modulation of the optical lattice, we can tune the couplings in different directions independently, even from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic. A major advantage of our approach is that standard Bose-Einstein-condensate temperatures are sufficient to observe magnetic phenomena like N\'eel order and spin frustration. We are able to study a very rich phase diagram and even to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by frustration. In addition, the quantum states realized in our spin simulator are yet unobserved superfluid phases with non-trivial long-range order and staggered circulating plaquette currents, which break time reversal symmetry. These findings open the route towards highly debated phases like spin-liquids and the study of the dynamics of quantum phase transitions."
https://openalex.org/W1995827355,"Sex in mammals is determined in the fetal gonad by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome gene Sry, which controls whether bipotential precursor cells differentiate into testicular Sertoli cells or ovarian granulosa cells. This pivotal decision in a single gonadal cell type ultimately controls sexual differentiation throughout the body. Sex determination can be viewed as a battle for primacy in the fetal gonad between a male regulatory gene network in which Sry activates Sox9 and a female network involving WNT/β-catenin signalling. In females the primary sex-determining decision is not final: loss of the FOXL2 transcription factor in adult granulosa cells can reprogram granulosa cells into Sertoli cells. Here we show that sexual fate is also surprisingly labile in the testis: loss of the DMRT1 transcription factor in mouse Sertoli cells, even in adults, activates Foxl2 and reprograms Sertoli cells into granulosa cells. In this environment, theca cells form, oestrogen is produced and germ cells appear feminized. Thus Dmrt1 is essential to maintain mammalian testis determination, and competing regulatory networks maintain gonadal sex long after the fetal choice between male and female. Dmrt1 and Foxl2 are conserved throughout vertebrates and Dmrt1-related sexual regulators are conserved throughout metazoans. Antagonism between Dmrt1 and Foxl2 for control of gonadal sex may therefore extend beyond mammals. Reprogramming due to loss of Dmrt1 also may help explain the aetiology of human syndromes linked to DMRT1, including disorders of sexual differentiation and testicular cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2008712670,"Recombination, together with mutation, gives rise to genetic variation in populations. Here we leverage the recent mixture of people of African and European ancestry in the Americas to build a genetic map measuring the probability of crossing over at each position in the genome, based on about 2.1 million crossovers in 30,000 unrelated African Americans. At intervals of more than three megabases it is nearly identical to a map built in Europeans. At finer scales it differs significantly, and we identify about 2,500 recombination hotspots that are active in people of West African ancestry but nearly inactive in Europeans. The probability of a crossover at these hotspots is almost fully controlled by the alleles an individual carries at PRDM9 (P value < 10−245). We identify a 17-base-pair DNA sequence motif that is enriched in these hotspots, and is an excellent match to the predicted binding target of PRDM9 alleles common in West Africans and rare in Europeans. Sites of this motif are predicted to be risk loci for disease-causing genomic rearrangements in individuals carrying these alleles. More generally, this map provides a resource for research in human genetic variation and evolution. Genetic maps measure the probability of crossovers at each position in a genome and are valuable tools for the study of variation in populations. A genetic map has now been constructed using data from 18,000 African American individuals. Comparison with European genetic maps reveals more than 2,000 recombination hot spots that are active in people of West African ancestry but inactive in most Europeans. The probability of crossover at these hot spots is controlled at the PRDM9 locus. A 17-base-pair DNA sequence motif is enriched at these hot spots, a source of risk for disease-causing genomic rearrangements."

https://openalex.org/W2021905453,"Life-long neurogenesis is known to occur in some areas of the mammalian adult brain, including in the subventricular zone (SVZ), where interaction between neural precursor cells and resident astrocytes can produced migratory neuroblasts. Here, Anne Ferguson-Smith and colleagues reveal a differential role for the same developmental gene, Dlk1, in neural precursor cells and astrocytes. The gene product, the Notch ligand DLK1, has two isoforms. One is an inductive niche factor secreted by astrocytes, and the other is a membrane-bound isoform required by the neural stem cells themselves to respond to secreted DLK1. Selective changes of imprinting with age modulate the role of Dlk1 in each cell type in mice, regulating neurogenesis when establishing the adult neurogenic niche. The modulation of genomic imprinting in a stem-cell environment adds a previously unrecognized element to epigenetic regulation. The gene for the atypical NOTCH ligand delta-like homologue 1 (Dlk1) encodes membrane-bound and secreted isoforms that function in several developmental processes in vitro and in vivo. Dlk1, a member of a cluster of imprinted genes, is expressed from the paternally inherited chromosome1,2. Here we show that mice that are deficient in Dlk1 have defects in postnatal neurogenesis in the subventricular zone: a developmental continuum that results in depletion of mature neurons in the olfactory bulb. We show that DLK1 is secreted by niche astrocytes, whereas its membrane-bound isoform is present in neural stem cells (NSCs) and is required for the inductive effect of secreted DLK1 on self-renewal. Notably, we find that there is a requirement for Dlk1 to be expressed from both maternally and paternally inherited chromosomes. Selective absence of Dlk1 imprinting in both NSCs and niche astrocytes is associated with postnatal acquisition of DNA methylation at the germ-line-derived imprinting control region. The results emphasize molecular relationships between NSCs and the niche astrocyte cells of the microenvironment, identifying a signalling system encoded by a single gene that functions coordinately in both cell types. The modulation of genomic imprinting in a stem-cell environment adds a new level of epigenetic regulation to the establishment and maintenance of the niche, raising wider questions about the adaptability, function and evolution of imprinting in specific developmental contexts."

https://openalex.org/W2077836199,"Quantum decoherence, a fundamental process by which fragile quantum information is lost to the environment, is the key limitation to many envisaged exotic applications of quantum mechanics. However, in many systems of practical interest it remains poorly constrained by theory and experiment. Takahashi et al. show that for one such system — crystals of a quantum molecular magnet — the principal decoherence processes responsible for loss of quantum information can be quantitatively predicted and experimentally verified. Quantum decoherence is a central concept in physics. Applications such as quantum information processing depend on understanding it; there are even fundamental theories proposed that go beyond quantum mechanics1,2,3, in which the breakdown of quantum theory would appear as an ‘intrinsic’ decoherence, mimicking the more familiar environmental decoherence processes4. Such applications cannot be optimized, and such theories cannot be tested, until we have a firm handle on ordinary environmental decoherence processes. Here we show that the theory for insulating electronic spin systems can make accurate and testable predictions for environmental decoherence in molecular-based quantum magnets5. Experiments on molecular magnets have successfully demonstrated quantum-coherent phenomena6,7,8 but the decoherence processes that ultimately limit such behaviour were not well constrained. For molecular magnets, theory predicts three principal contributions to environmental decoherence: from phonons, from nuclear spins and from intermolecular dipolar interactions. We use high magnetic fields on single crystals of Fe8 molecular magnets (in which the Fe ions are surrounded by organic ligands) to suppress dipolar and nuclear-spin decoherence. In these high-field experiments, we find that the decoherence time varies strongly as a function of temperature and magnetic field. The theoretical predictions are fully verified experimentally, and there are no other visible decoherence sources. In these high fields, we obtain a maximum decoherence quality-factor of 1.49 × 106; our investigation suggests that the environmental decoherence time can be extended up to about 500 microseconds, with a decoherence quality factor of ∼6 × 107, by optimizing the temperature, magnetic field and nuclear isotopic concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W1994907927,"Maraviroc is a nonpeptidic small molecule human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry inhibitor that has just entered the therapeutic arsenal for the treatment of patients. We recently demonstrated that maraviroc binding to the HIV-1 coreceptor, CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), prevents it from binding the chemokine CCL3 and the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 by an allosteric mechanism. However, incomplete knowledge of ligand-binding sites and the lack of CCR5 crystal structures have hampered an in-depth molecular understanding of how the inhibitor works. Here, we addressed these issues by combining site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) with homology modeling and docking. Six crystal structures of G-protein-coupled receptors were compared for their suitability for CCR5 modeling. All CCR5 models had equally good geometry, but that built from the recently reported dimeric structure of the other HIV-1 coreceptor CXCR4 bound to the peptide CVX15 (Protein Data Bank code 3OE0) best agreed with the SDM data and discriminated CCR5 from non-CCR5 binders in a virtual screening approach. SDM and automated docking predicted that maraviroc inserts deeply in CCR5 transmembrane cavity where it can occupy three different binding sites, whereas CCL3 and gp120 lie on distinct yet overlapped regions of the CCR5 extracellular loop 2. Data suggesting that the transmembrane cavity remains accessible for maraviroc in CCL3-bound and gp120-bound CCR5 help explain our previous observation that the inhibitor enhances dissociation of preformed ligand-CCR5 complexes. Finally, we identified residues in the predicted CCR5 dimer interface that are mandatory for gp120 binding, suggesting that receptor dimerization might represent a target for new CCR5 entry inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2037184235,"The physiological roles of taurine, a product of cysteine degradation and one of the most abundant amino acids in the body, remain elusive. Taurine deficiency leads to heart dysfunction, brain development abnormalities, retinal degradation, and other pathologies. The taurine synthetic pathway is proposed to be incomplete in astrocytes and neurons, and metabolic cooperation between these cell types is reportedly needed to complete the pathway. In this study, we analyzed taurine synthesis capability as reported by incorporation of radioactivity from [35S]cysteine into taurine, in primary murine astrocytes and neurons, and in several transformed cell lines (human (SH-SY5Y) and murine (N1E-115) neuroblastoma, human astrocytoma (U-87MG and 1321 N1), and rat glioma (C6)). Extensive incorporation of radioactivity from [35S]cysteine into taurine was observed in rat glioma cells as well as in primary mouse astrocytes and neurons, establishing the presence of an intact taurine synthesis pathway in these cells. Interestingly, exposure of cells to cysteine or cysteamine resulted in elevated intracellular hypotaurine without a corresponding increase in taurine levels, suggesting that oxidation of hypotaurine limits taurine synthesis in cells. Consistent with its role as an organic osmolyte, taurine synthesis was stimulated under hypertonic conditions in neurons.

Consistent with its role as an organic osmolyte, taurine synthesis was stimulated under hypertonic conditions in neurons. Taurine, or ethanesulfonic acid, is one of the most abundant amino acids in the body whose physiological role remains elusive. Its biosynthesis involves the sequential oxidation of cysteine to cysteinesulfinic acid, catalyzed by cysteine dioxygenase, decarboxylation by cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase, and oxidation of the resulting hypotaurine to taurine by a putative hypotaurine dehydrogenase (Fig. 1). The latter enzyme has, however, not been purified to homogeneity and remains uncharacterized (1Sumizu K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Oja S.S.

In fact, it has been suggested that oxidation of hypotaurine to taurine might occur via a nonenzymatic reaction in cells (4Fiori A. Costa M. Acta Vitaminol. Enzymol. 1969; 23: 204-207PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ricci G. Dupré S. Federici G. Spoto G. Matarese R.M. Cavallini D. Physiol. Chem. Phys. 1978; 10: 435-441PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fellman J.H. Green T.R. Eicher A.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1987; 217: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hypotaurine can also be produced via oxidation of cysteamine, the end product of coenzyme A degradation (Fig. 1). Cysteamine oxidation is catalyzed by 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase, which is widely expressed in mammalian tissues (7Dominy Jr., J.E. Simmons C.R. Hirschberger L.L. Hwang J. Coloso R.M. Stipanuk M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25189-25198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although it is generally believed that taurine cannot be further metabolized and is excreted by the kidney or as a bile component, there are several older reports in the literature on the conversion of taurine to isethionic acid in mammalian tissues (8Read W.O.

Taurine deficiency is associated with heart dysfunction, brain development abnormalities, retinal degradation, and other pathologies (3Huxtable R.J. Prog.

Taurine is actively transported into cells by a specific Na+-dependent transporter (TAUT) and accumulates to high concentrations particularly in the liver, muscle, and retina. Genetic disruption of the taut gene encoding the taurine transporter results in decreased tissue taurine levels and is associated with a number of abnormalities, including blindness, a low capacity for physical exercise, and decreased fertility (18Warskulat U. Heller-Stilb B. Oermann E. Zilles K. Haas H. Lang F. Häussinger D. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 428: 439-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Regulatory mechanisms exist in cells to stabilize intracellular volume and rely on a variety of inorganic ions and organic osmolytes, including taurine, which is abundant. In the brain, small molecule osmolytes like taurine might be better suited than ions for volume regulation because significant ion fluxes would perturb the transmembrane potential and, therefore, electrical activity (19Banerjee R. Vitvitsky V. Garg S.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 413-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In fact, taurine efflux and intracellular accumulation under hypotonic and hypertonic conditions, respectively, have been observed in astrocytes, neurons, and brain slices (13Tuz K. Ordaz B. Vaca L. Quesada O. Pasantes-Morales H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Hussy N. Deleuze C. Brès V. Moos F.C. Adv. Exp. Med.

Taurine levels are highest in the developing brain at a time when the concentration of other amino acids is relatively low. In the brain, biosynthesis of taurine is postulated to involve metabolic cooperation between astrocytes and neurons. Neurons reportedly lack cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase (22Tappaz M. Almarghini K. Do K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 359: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and are thought to either rely on astrocytes for the provision of hypotaurine (23Brand A. Richter-Landsberg C. Leibfritz D. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 645-657PubMed Google Scholar) or to acquire taurine via transport. Interestingly, coculture of neurons and astrocytes leads to a 10-fold decrease in the hypotaurine:taurine ratio in astrocytes (23Brand A. Richter-Landsberg C. Leibfritz D. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 645-657PubMed Google Scholar). These results were interpreted as evidence for intercellular metabolic coupling, i.e. the presence of neurons modulates the hypotaurine:taurine ratio in astrocytes, whereas the presence of astrocytes increases neuronal taurine content. However, these labeling studies were performed with supraphysiological concentrations of cysteine rather than the relevant extracellular form of this amino acid, cystine, raising questions about their biological relevance (23Brand A. Richter-Landsberg C. Leibfritz D. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 645-657PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured astrocytes, unlike neurons, exhibit fairly high concentrations of hypotaurine. However, the significance of hypotaurine accumulation in astrocytes is unclear (24Brand A. Leibfritz D. Hamprecht B. Dringen R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the whole brain, hypotaurine is estimated to be present at approximately 1% of taurine levels (25Perry T.L. Hansen S. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 1009-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hypotaurine is postulated to function as an antioxidant, and astrocytic hypotaurine is believed to be exported to neurons, where it is converted to taurine (3Huxtable R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1989; 32: 471-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 23Brand A. Richter-Landsberg C. Leibfritz D. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 645-657PubMed Google Scholar, 24Brand A. Leibfritz D. Hamprecht B. Dringen R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Labeling rat astrocytes with [13C]cysteine results in labeling of intra- and extracellular hypotaurine and taurine, which were detected by NMR spectroscopy (24Brand A. Leibfritz D. Hamprecht B. Dringen R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It was estimated that after 72 h of labeling, 35% of the hypotaurine and 23% of the taurine pools were labeled. In this study, we analyzed taurine synthesis capability in several transformed cell lines and in primary murine astrocytes and neurons. We report robust incorporation of radioactivity from [35S]cysteine into taurine in rat glioma cells (C6) as well as in primary mouse astrocytes and neurons. The rate of [35S]cysteine accumulation into the taurine pool in primary and transformed cell lines is comparable with its rate of accumulation in the glutathione pool, indicating the quantitative significance of the endogenous taurine synthesis pathway. Taurine synthesis was stimulated under hypertonic conditions in neurons but not in astrocytes. Interestingly, conditions that lead to elevated intracellular hypotaurine do not result in a corresponding increase in taurine levels, suggesting that oxidation of hypotaurine limits taurine synthesis, at least in brain cells. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and human astrocytoma U-87 MG cell lines were obtained from ATCC. Human astrocytoma 1321 N1, mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115, and rat glioma C6 cell lines were obtained from Dr. Steven Fisher (University of Michigan).

The protocols for animal handling were approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals, University of Michigan. All transformed cell lines (i.e. astrocytomas, neuroblastomas, and glioma) were cultured in 6-well plates with 100% medium change.

All media contained 10% FBS (Hyclone, South Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Astrocytes were cultured for three passages in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% heat- inactivated FBS (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. At the end of the third passage, primary astrocytes were seeded in 6-well (2 × 106 cells/well), 12-well (1 × 106 cells/well), or 24-well (5 × 105 cells/well) plates and incubated for a week (with 50% of the medium being changed every third day). The purity of astrocytes was determined as described previously (27Garg S.K. Kipnis J. Banerjee R. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and was ≥ 93%. Neurons were cultured in 6-well (6 × 105 cells/well) or 24-well (1 × 105 cells/well) plates in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing B27 supplement (1×) (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively) on laminin- (Invitrogen) and poly-D-lysine- (Sigma) coated glass coverslips (26Garg S.K. Banerjee R. Kipnis J. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 3866-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Garg S.K. Kipnis J. Banerjee R. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The purity of neurons was assessed by staining with antibody to anti-β III tubulin (TUJ1) (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and found to be > 95% as visualized microscopically. In all cases, cells were cultured with 0.5, 1, and 2 ml of medium/well in 24-, 12-, and 6-well plates, respectively. At the beginning of each experiment, 100% of the medium was changed for all cell types except neurons, for which 50% of the medium was changed. Simultaneously with the medium change, other reagents were added as desired. To prepare the hypertonic medium, 10 μl of 5 m NaCl solution was added per ml of incubation medium. To detect incorporation of cysteine into different metabolites, 0.2 μl of [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 10 mCi/ml, > 1000 Ci/mmol) was added per 1 ml of incubation medium. All stock solutions were sterilized by filtration through a 0.2-μm filter. Incubation of human astrocytoma U-87 MG cells and primary mouse astrocytes in media supplemented with dialyzed FBS was performed as follows. Astrocytoma cells were split into new plates in medium supplemented either with 10% standard or dialyzed FBS (Hyclone). After 3 days of incubation, the medium was changed (standard or dialyzed, respectively), and 48 h later, cells were harvested. For primary astrocytes, 100% of the medium was replaced with standard medium or with medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS. Three to four days later, a second 100% medium change was done (standard or dialyzed, respectively), and 48 h later, cell samples were collected. Cells incubated in the media supplemented with standard FBS were used as controls. The use of dialyzed FBS did not appear to affect the appearance of primary astrocytes or rat glioma cells nor influence their growth rate under our experimental conditions. To measure taurine levels in the culture medium, 100 μl of the medium was mixed with 100 μl of 10% TCA. For analysis of intracellular metabolite levels, the culture medium was aspirated, cells were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped with a plastic spatula, and resuspended in a small volume of PBS. For analysis of thiol metabolites, 100 μl of cell suspension was mixed with an equal volume of metaphosphoric acid solution (16.8 mg/ml HPO3, 2 mg/ml EDTA, 9 mg/ml NaCl). For taurine and hypotaurine analysis, 100 μl of cell suspension was mixed with 100 μl of 10% TCA. For protein analysis, 30 μl of cell suspension was mixed with 30 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cells and tissue extracts (Sigma), 25 μg/ml tosyllysine chloromethylketone, 17 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). When cultures from 12- or 24-well plates were used, cells from 2 or 4 wells, respectively, were pooled prior to processing. Samples were stored at −80 °C until use. For metabolite and protein analysis, samples were thawed, vortexed, and centrifuged, and supernatants were used. Thiols (GSH, GSSG, and cysteine) were analyzed following derivatization with iodoacetic acid and dinitrofluorobenzene followed by separation on a 300 × 3.9 mm μ Bondapak-NH2 HPLC column (Waters, Milford, MA) as described previously (28Garg S.K. Yan Z. Vitvitsky V. Banerjee R. Methods in Redox Signaling. Mary Ann Liebert, New York2009: 7-11Google Scholar). To measure incorporation of radioactivity into thiol metabolites, HPLC fractions corresponding to the metabolite peaks were collected, and radioactivity in the fractions was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Taurine and hypotaurine concentrations were analyzed as described previously (29Foster D.J. Vitvitsky V.M. Banerjee R. Heacock A.M. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were neutralized to pH 7–8 with saturated K2CO3 solution and diluted 5- (medium samples) or 10-fold (cell samples) with sodium borate buffer (0.2 m (pH 9.6)). A 50-μl aliquot of diluted sample was derivatized with 25 μl of o-phthaldialdehyde solution (15 mm o-phthaldialdehyde, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 10% methanol (v/v) in 0.2 m sodium borate buffer (pH 9.6)) for 1 min at 10 °C. A 10-μl aliquot of the derivatized sample was then injected into a 4.6 × 150 mm ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 (5 μm) analytical HPLC column (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a gradient of methanol (38% to 56% from 0 to 10 min, 56% to 80% from 10 to 15 min, 80% from 15 to 20 min) in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.75). Eluted peaks were detected by fluorescence at 340 nm excitation and 450 nm emission wavelengths. To measure incorporation of radioactivity into taurine and hypotaurine, the neutralized samples were diluted 1:1 with the borate buffer, and after derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde solution, 50 μl of each sample was injected into the column. Eluted peaks were detected by absorption at 340 nm. HPLC fractions corresponding to taurine and hypotaurine peaks were collected, and radioactivity in these fractions was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Incorporation of radioactivity in the protein pool was measured in precipitates obtained after addition of 10% TCA to cell samples. The protein precipitate was washed twice with 6% TCA and then dissolved in 100 μl of 0.5 m NaOH and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Approximately 2–4.5% of the total extracellular radioactivity was incorporated into intracellular protein and metabolite pools in 10 h. We note that the extracellular volume is approximately 100-fold greater than the intracellular volume under our cell culture conditions. All intracellular parameters were normalized to protein concentration in cell suspension. The protein concentration in samples was measured using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. In preliminary experiments, we have found that incubation of human astrocytoma (U-87 MG) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells with varying concentrations of cysteamine or its oxidized disulfide form, cystamine, results in an approximately 2- to 4-fold increase in intracellular hypotaurine concentrations (Fig. 2). The dependence of hypotaurine accumulation on cysteamine or cystamine concentration indicates that 1) cystamine is rapidly converted to cysteamine because the dependence of hypotaurine concentration on cysteamine versus 2× cystamine is identical and 2) that hypotaurine formation is saturated at approximately 50 μm cysteamine in both cell lines. In contrast to hypotaurine concentrations, which remain significantly elevated over a 48-h period following exposure to cysteamine (Fig. 3) or cystamine, taurine concentrations were not similarly increased during prolonged incubation of cells with these precursors (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). This result does not support the hypothesis that conversion of hypotaurine to taurine occurs nonenzymatically. Instead, it demonstrates that the capacity for enzymatic conversion of hypotaurine to taurine is either absent or that the conversion is tightly regulated in these cell lines.FIGURE 3Time-dependent changes in intracellular taurine and hypotaurine concentrations in human astrocytoma (U-87MG) (A) and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) (B) cells, incubated with 200 μm extracellular cysteamine. The data represent the mean ± S.D. n = 4 and 6 for U-87MG and SH-SY5Y cells, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we examined whether the pathway for taurine biosynthesis from cysteine is intact in several brain-derived transformed cell lines. For this, we monitored incorporation of [35S]cysteine into hypotaurine and taurine (Fig. 4). Of the five lines that were tested, only the rat glioma line, C6, showed significant incorporation of radioactivity into taurine (Fig. 4). To estimate how much cysteine is partitioned into taurine versus protein and glutathione, incorporation of [35S]cysteine into these pools was tracked in the C6 cell line (Fig. 5). Although the concentrations of cysteine and hypotaurine were stable over 24 h, glutathione and taurine levels declined. However, the specific radioactivity increased in all metabolite pools within the first 10 h of incubation with the exception of cysteine. Radioactive cysteine added to the incubation medium equilibrates with the intracellular cysteine pool within 1–2 h, after which the specific radioactivity of intracellular cysteine is more or less constant. These results suggest a fairly high turnover of the glutathione, taurine, and hypotaurine pools. Although the taurine concentration is approximately 1.5-fold higher than glutathione in the C6 cell line, the initial rate of radiolabel incorporation into glutathione, determined within the first 10 h of incubation, is approximately 2-fold greater than in the hypotaurine plus taurine pools (Fig. 5), suggesting a higher rate of turnover in the glutathione pool. Significant incorporation of radioactive cysteine into the protein pool, which was substantially greater than into other metabolite pools was observed in C6 cells, consistent with their rapidly proliferating phenotype. Partitioning of cysteine into the various pools was also monitored in primary neurons and astrocytes (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). Both the absolute and relative concentrations of sulfur tied up in the glutathione and taurine pools showed cell line-specific variations. Thus, the relative concentration of taurine was approximately 1.5-fold higher than of glutathione in the rat glioma cell line (Fig. 5) and up to 2-fold higher in murine astrocytes (Fig. 6). However, the absolute concentration of these metabolites was approximately 2-fold higher in murine astrocytes compared with the rat glioma cell line. In contrast, the glutathione concentration was approximately 5-fold higher than taurine in murine neurons (Fig. 7). It should be noted, however, that the low taurine concentration in cultured neurons might be partially due to the absence of taurine from the neuron culture medium, which contained taurine-free B27 supplement instead of FBS. All other culture media used in this study were supplemented with 10% FBS, which contains taurine. Thus, cells could accumulate taurine from the medium via transmembrane transport (as also discussed below for experiments comparing cells cultured with normal versus dialyzed FBS).FIGURE 7Time-dependent changes in sulfur metabolite concentrations (A), incorporation of radioactivity into sulfur metabolites (B), and incorporation of radioactivity into proteins (C) in primary mouse neurons following incubation with [35S]cysteine. Representative data from three independent experiments are shown. CPM, counts per minute.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cell-specific patterns of sulfur metabolite concentrations and distribution of [35S]cysteine between the metabolite and protein pools were seen (Fig. 8). In the fast-growing glioma cell line, approximately 55% of the radioactivity was associated with the protein pool at 10 h in comparison with approximately 35% in neurons and approximately 20% in astrocytes. The proportion of radiolabel incorporation into the glutathione pool was similar in all three cell types (approximately 30–50%). Astrocytes incorporated substantially more radioactivity in the combined hypotaurine/taurine pool (approximately 50%) than the other two cell types. Because we observed that several transformed cell lines convert cysteamine to hypotaurine but not to taurine (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), we investigated this issue with primary astrocytes and neurons, which convert cysteine to taurine. As with the U-87 MG and SH-SY5Y cell lines, addition of cysteamine to murine astrocytes or neurons led to a significant elevation of hypotaurine levels (Fig. 9A). Furthermore, hypotaurine levels also increased in response to supplementation with cysteine or cysteine sulfinic acid (not shown). However, a corresponding increase in the concentration of taurine was not observed (Fig. 9B). To assess the contribution of taurine import to the intracellular pool size, primary astrocytes and the U-87MG astrocytoma cell line were cultured in media containing dialyzed FBS and hence lacking detectable levels of taurine. The concentration of taurine in the culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS is approximately 15 μm, which, over time, can be concentrated to the millimolar levels seen inside cells. When cells were cultured in the media containing dialyzed FBS, the concentration of taurine decreased by 80% in the U-87 MG cell line, which is unable to synthesize taurine (Fig. 10). In contrast, the taurine concentration in primary astrocytes, which can synthesize taurine, diminished by approximately 35% (Fig. 10). Because neurons are cultured in a serum-free medium lacking taurine, the intracellular taurine pool in these cells must be derived via synthesis. A major role ascribed to taurine in the central nervous system is osmoregulation. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the response of the U-87MG cell line, which is unable to synthesize taurine, to an increase in extracellular osmolarity (from 300 to 400 mosmole). Over a 48-h period, intracellular taurine levels in U-87MG cells increased by approximately 50% in response to hypertonic culture conditions, and this increase was accompanied by a significant decrease in extracellular taurine concentration (Fig. 11A). In response to hypertonic culture conditions, taurine concentration increased 14% in 48 h in primary astrocytes (Fig. 11B). The intracellular increase in taurine was accompanied by a more modest decrease in extracellular taurine levels versus the change observed with U-87 MG cells. To assess whether taurine synthesis was activated under hypertonic conditions, incorporation of the radiolabel from [35S]cysteine into taurine was monitored. An approximately 11% increase in radiolabel incorporation into the taurine pool was observed under hyperosmotic versus isoosmotic conditions (Fig 11B). Exposure of primary neurons to hypertonic culture conditions resulted in an approximately 6-fold increase in intracellular taurine concentration (Fig. 11C). This was accompanied by a corresponding increase in radiolabel incorporation from [35S]cysteine into taurine and a modest decrease in extracellular taurine concentrations (Fig. 11, D and E). Despite the quantitatively significant investment of sulfur in the taurine pool, fundamental questions about the allocation of the biosynthetic responsibility between glial and neuronal cells for taurine synthesis are mired in controversy and remain unanswered. Thus, conflicting models have been proposed for the synthesis of taurine, primarily on the basis of localization studies on cysteine dioxygenase and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase in neurons versus astrocytes (30Dominy J. Eller S. Dawson Jr., R. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and propose 1) that the pathway is initiated in neurons and that cysteine sulfinic acid is exported to astrocytes or 2) that the pathway is initiated in astrocytes and that hypotaurine is exported to neurons. In addition, the contribution of the cysteamine pathway to taurine synthesis in these cells is not known. In this study, we have assessed the ability of primary and transformed brain-derived cells to synthesize taurine from cysteine and characterized the changes in taurine synthesis and transport in response to hypertonic culture conditions. We demonstrate that although incubation of brain-derived cell lines, primary astrocytes and neurons with cysteamine or cysteine, leads to a significant accumulation of intracellular hypotaurine, a corresponding increase in taurine concentration is not observed. These results suggest strongly that conversion of hypotaurine to taurine is catalyzed and that it is regulated. Although a putative hypotaurine dehydrogenase has been described (1Sumizu K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 2Oja S.S. Kontro P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 677: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 3Huxtable R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1989; 32: 471-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), it has not been purified to homogeneity and characterized. Intracellular taurine pools are substantial; In the 1–50 mm range, depending on the tissue, the organism, sex, and age (3Huxtable R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1989; 32: 471-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 31Nakamura H. Yatsuki J. Ubuka T. Amino Acids. 2006; 31: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 32Worden J.A. Stipanuk M.H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1985; 82: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hence, unregulated oxidation of hypotaurine to taurine, which is coupled to reduction of an as yet unidentified cofactor, would result in large perturbations in its intracellular redox potential and, therefore, must be regulated. This suggests that unlike most metabolic pathways where the rate-limiting step is early in the sequence, in the taurine synthetic pathway, the ultimate step is at least partially rate-determining. Incorporation of the radiolabel from [35S]cysteine into taurine in primary murine astrocytes and neurons and in the C6 rat glioma cell line provide unequivocal evidence for the capacity of these cell types to oxidize cysteine to taurine. These results lay to rest the controversy over whether or not the taurine biosynthetic pathway is intact in individual brain cell types (30Dominy J. Eller S. Dawson Jr., R. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Metabolic cooperation between astrocytes and neurons has been proposed as a strategy for taurine biosynthesis. The controversy likely stems from the inability of many (but not all) transformed cell lines to convert cysteine to taurine as demonstrated in this study, which might be due to the repression of cysteine dioxygenase in transformed lines (34Dominy Jr., J.E. Hwang J. Stipanuk M.H. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: E62-E69Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In fact, our data confirm an earlier report demonstrating the ability of cultured rat astrocytes to synthesize taurine from cysteine (35Beetsch J.W. Olson J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C866-C874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione and taurine represent quantitatively significant pools of highly reduced and oxidized organic sulfur species, respectively. By tracing the fate of [35S]cysteine, we have estimated its partitioning into the glutathione and taurine pools in primary neurons, astrocytes, and in a glioma cell line (Fig. 8). We find cell line-specific patterns in incorporation of a radiolabel into these metabolite pools. Thus, in the rat glioma line and in murine neurons, 2- and 5-fold more radioactivity is incorporated into glutathione compared with the hypotaurine/taurine pool. In murine astrocytes the situation is reversed, and approximately 1.5-fold more radioactivity is incorporated into the hypotaurine/taurine pool compared with glutathione (Fig. 8). In all three cell types, turnover of the hypotaurine/taurine pool is comparable with that of glutathione and, thus, relatively rapid. Proteins represent a third large intracellular sink for cysteine. As anticipated for the rapidly growing rat glioma cell line, the largest fraction of radiolabel incorporation from cysteine was into the protein pool. Astrocytes showed the lowest accumulation in the protein pool, whereas in neurons, the radioactivity in the protein pool was intermediate between the glutathione and taurine/hypotaurine pools. Interestingly, in all three cell types, 30–50% of the radiolabel was partitioned toward glutathione synthesis. In the human astrocytoma U-87MG cell line, a significant (approximately 80%) depletion of the intracellular taurine pool was observed when cells were grown in taurine-free medium (Fig. 10). This result is consistent with U-87MG cells being dependent solely on taurine import for maintaining the intracellular pool of this metabolite. In contrast, the intracellular taurine pool in astrocytes is less susceptible to exogenous depletion of this metabolite because these cells are capable of taurine synthesis. Cells possess volume regulatory mechanisms to deal with fluctuations in osmolarity. Cell swelling leads to extrusion of ions/osmolytes and, subsequently, to regulatory volume decrease (36Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Völkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Häussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Cell shrinkage has the converse effect and leads to ion/osmolyte accumulation that achieves regulatory volume increase. Some metabolic pathways are known to be sensitive to cell volume changes. For instance, cell swelling increases glycogen synthesis and inhibits glycolysis, which serves to decrease the cellular concentration of carbohydrates (36Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Völkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Häussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). The effect of osmolarity changes on the sulfur metabolic pathway is not known. The sensitivity of taurine transport to changes in the osmolarity of the culture medium has been noted previously (29Foster D.J. Vitvitsky V.M. Banerjee R. Heacock A.M. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 37Hoffmann E.K. Lambert I.H. Pedersen S.F. Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 193-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar, 38Lambert I.H. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Hypoosmotic conditions stimulate taurine efflux from cells, whereas hyperosmotic conditions lead to taurine accumulation. Osmosensitive taurine release appears to occur via a volume-sensitive organic anion channel and is blocked by anion channel inhibitors (39Jackson P.S. Strange K. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1489-C1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, one such inhibitor significantly improves recovery in an experimental model for brain trauma/hypoxia (40Kimelberg H.K. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Nelson L.R. Popp A.J. Szarowski D. Rose J.W. Woltersdorf Jr., O.W. Pietruszkiewicz A.M. Cent. Nerv. Syst. Trauma. 1987; 4: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In cultured astrocytes, a 50% decrease in osmolarity leads to a 40-fold increase in taurine efflux rate (35Beetsch J.W. Olson J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C866-C874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We find that the taurine concentration increases in the U-87MG astrocytoma line in response to hypertonic shock and is accompanied by a dramatic decrease in extracellular taurine levels. This result is consistent with activation of taurine influx into cells under hyperosmotic conditions. A similar response was observed in primary astrocytes, although the increase in intracellular taurine was due to both import and increased synthesis. A dramatic increase in intracellular taurine levels was observed in murine neurons in response to hyperosmotic shock. The increase was due in part to increased import and in part to activation of taurine synthesis. The rise in intracellular neuronal taurine concentration in the face of constant extracellular taurine concentration (Fig. 11, C and E) can only be explained by activation of taurine synthesis under these conditions. Pathological conditions that elicit neural cell swelling include ischemia, traumatic head injury and brain edema, hypoglycemia, prolonged hypoxia, hepatic encephalopathy, and hyponatremia. The latter is a common clinical condition resulting from volume dysregulation and affects between 2.5–5.0% of hospitalized patients and disproportionately affects the young and the elderly (41Bhardwaj A. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 59: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 42Lien Y.H. Shapiro J.I. Chan L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Depending on the magnitude, hyponatremia can elicit symptoms ranging from emesis and headaches to respiratory arrest, coma, and brain damage (33Fisher S.K. Cheema T.A. Foster D.J. Heacock A.M. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1998-2014PubMed Google Scholar). Given the clinical relevance, the responsiveness of neurons and astrocytes to changes in osmotic conditions warrants investigation."

A striking feature of these proteins is that 65% contain a predicted α-helical transmembrane (TM) domain. This prompted us to examine the localization, topology, and membrane insertion of the small proteins. Biochemical fractionation showed that, consistent with the predicted TM helix, the small proteins generally are most abundant in the inner membrane fraction. Examples of both N(in)-C(out) and N(out)-C(in) orientations were found in assays of topology-reporter fusions to representative small TM proteins. Interestingly, however, three of nine tested proteins display dual topology. Positive residues close to the transmembrane domains are conserved, and mutational analysis of one small protein, YohP, showed that the positive inside rule applies for single transmembrane domain proteins as has been observed for larger proteins. Finally, fractionation analysis of small protein localization in strains depleted of the Sec or YidC membrane insertion pathways uncovered differential requirements. Some small proteins appear to be affected by both Sec and YidC depletion, others showed more dependence on one or the other insertion pathway, whereas one protein was not affected by depletion of either Sec or YidC. Thus, despite their diminutive size, small proteins display considerable diversity in topology, biochemical features, and insertion pathways."

Available data suggest that it is particularly promising for bladder cancer prevention and/or treatment. Here, we show that AITC arrests human bladder cancer cells in mitosis and also induces apoptosis. Mitotic arrest by AITC was associated with increased ubiquitination and degradation of α- and β-tubulin. AITC directly binds to multiple cysteine residues of the tubulins. AITC induced mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis, as shown by cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and formation of TUNEL-positive cells. Inhibition of caspase-9 blocked AITC-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we found that apoptosis induction by AITC depended entirely on mitotic arrest and was mediated via Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser-70. Pre-arresting cells in G1 phase by hydroxyurea abrogated both AITC-induced mitotic arrest and Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Overexpression of a Bcl-2 mutant prevented AITC from inducing apoptosis. We further showed that AITC-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation was caused by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and AITC activates JNK. Taken together, this study has revealed a novel anticancer mechanism of a phytochemical that is commonly present in human diet. Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) occurs in many commonly consumed cruciferous vegetables and exhibits significant anti-cancer activities. Available data suggest that it is particularly promising for bladder cancer prevention and/or treatment. Here, we show that AITC arrests human bladder cancer cells in mitosis and also induces apoptosis. Mitotic arrest by AITC was associated with increased ubiquitination and degradation of α- and β-tubulin. AITC directly binds to multiple cysteine residues of the tubulins. AITC induced mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis, as shown by cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and formation of TUNEL-positive cells.

Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) 2The abbreviations used are: AITCallyl isothiocyanateBITCbenzyl isothiocyanateCyt ccytochrome cHUhydroxyureaPARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseUbubiquitinJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseIPimmunoprecipitation. is a naturally occurring compound that possesses both antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Many commonly consumed cruciferous vegetables are rich sources of AITC, such as mustard, horseradish, wasabi, and cabbage. Its bactericidal and fungicidal activities were demonstrated against a variety of pathogens, and its anticancer activities were shown in both cultured cancer cell lines and animal tumor models (1Zhang Y. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2010; 54: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Bioavailability of AITC is extremely high; nearly 90% of orally administered AITC is absorbed (1Zhang Y. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2010; 54: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Although available evidence indicates that the anticancer activity of AITC is neither cell- nor tissue-specific, we have recently shown that AITC is selectively delivered to bladder tissue through urinary excretion and potently inhibits cancer development and muscle invasion in an orthotopic rat bladder cancer model (2Bhattacharya A. Tang L. Li Y. Geng F. Paonessa J.D. Chen S.C. Wong M.K. Zhang Y. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, an AITC-rich mustard seed powder also strongly inhibited bladder cancer development and muscle invasion in vivo (3Bhattacharya A. Li Y. Wade K.L. Paonessa J.D. Fahey J.W. Zhang Y. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, AITC is highly promising for bladder cancer prevention and/or treatment. These results are also consistent with epidemiological studies showing an inverse association between consumption of cruciferous vegetables and bladder cancer risk (4Michaud D.S. Spiegelman D.

In light of these findings, this study focuses on human bladder cancer cells. allyl isothiocyanate benzyl isothiocyanate cytochrome c hydroxyurea poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase ubiquitin c-Jun N-terminal kinase immunoprecipitation. Previous studies have shown that AITC causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cell lines of different tissue origins in vitro and in several tumor xenograft models in vivo, and it modulates many genes and proteins involved in cancer cell survival and proliferation (1Zhang Y. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2010; 54: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In our recent studies, both AITC and the AITC-rich mustard seed powder mentioned above arrested bladder cancer cells in G2/M phases and activated caspase-3 in bladder cancer cells in vitro and in bladder tumors in vivo (2Bhattacharya A. Tang L. Li Y. Geng F. Paonessa J.D. Chen S.C. Wong M.K. Zhang Y. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 3Bhattacharya A. Li Y. Wade K.L. Paonessa J.D. Fahey J.W. Zhang Y. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined whether AITC arrests cancer cells in both the G2 phase and M phase or only in one of the two phases. It is not known whether cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are linked to each other in AITC-treated cells. Answers to these questions are important for further development of this interesting agent against cancer. In this study, we show that AITC arrests bladder cancer cells exclusively in mitosis and targets two key proteins involved in mitosis. We also demonstrate that AITC induces mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis, but the apoptosis induction results entirely from mitotic arrest and that Bcl-2 phosphorylation by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) bridges mitotic arrest to apoptosis in response to AITC. Our study shows that AITC-treated cells die by mitotic catastrophe via Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Three human bladder cancer cell lines, all derived from invasive transitional cell carcinomas, were used, including UM-UC-3 cells, UM-UC-6 cells, and T24 cells. Their sources and culture conditions have been described previously (6Tang L. Zhang Y. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Tang L. Li G. Song L. Zhang Y. Anticancer Drugs. 2006; 17: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). AITC, benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), SP600125, and hydroxyurea (HU) were purchased from Sigma. Z-LEHD-FMK, rhodamine 123, MG-132, and JNK inhibitor XI (BI-87G3) were purchased from R & D Systems, Molecular Probes, EMD Millipore, and EMD/Calbiochem, respectively. HU was dissolved in water; other agents were dissolved in acetonitrile or DMSO; solvent concentrations in culture medium was ≤0.1% (v/v). Antibodies specific for Bcl-2, p-Bcl-2 (Ser(P)-87), His tag (His-probe H3), cytochrome c (Cyt c), lamin B1, α-tubulin (for IP), β-tubulin (for IP), and γ-tubulin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies specific for Bad, Bak, Bax, Bcl-xl, Bid, p-Bcl-2 (Ser(P)-70), β-tubulin (for Western blotting), caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-9, cleaved caspase-9, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cleaved PARP, JNK, JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, p-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), and voltage-dependent anion channel were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies specific for α-tubulin (for Western blotting), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were purchased from EMD/Calbiochem and Millipore, respectively. Cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes (1.5 × 106 cells/dish with 10 ml of medium) for 24 h and then transfected with pSFFV-neo (empty vector), pSFFV-HA-hBcl-2Δ (deletion of the loop domain of human Bcl-2 or amino acid residues 32–80), or pMT107-His-Ub (6× polyhistidine-tagged ubiquitin expression plasmid), 6–12 μg of DNA/dish and using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science); after 24 h, cells were treated with solvent or AITC for a desired time and then harvested for analysis. Cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes (1.5–3 × 106 cells/dish with 10 ml of medium) for 24 h and then subjected to various treatments. At the end of each treatment, cells were processed for determination of cell cycle progression by flow cytometry as described previously (6Tang L. Zhang Y. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For measurement of mitochondrial trans-membrane potential, cells were first treated with vehicle or AITC and then trypsinized, washed, and centrifuged. Each cell pellet was resuspended in fresh medium at 5 × 105 cells/ml and then incubated with rhodamine 123 at 10 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice, resuspended in an equal volume of fresh medium, and measured by flow cytometry (1 × 104 cells/sample). For TUNEL assay, cells after treatment with AITC or solvent were processed using the MEBSTAIN® apoptosis kit (MBL International), following the manufacturer's instruction, and finally measured for TUNEL-positive cells by flow cytometry. Cells harvested after treatment with solvent or AITC were washed with ice-cold PBS and suspended in 1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling), supplemented with 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysis was enhanced by sonication. Mitochondria and cytosols were prepared based on a published protocol (8Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Briefly, ∼2 × 107 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, placed on ice for 10 min, and then suspended in 0.75 ml of an isotonic homogenization buffer (25 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaEDTA, 1 mm NaEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science). The cells were stroked in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were cleared by low speed centrifugation, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was collected as cytosols, and the pellet containing mitochondria was washed three times with the homogenization buffer containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and then suspended in 1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling). Protein contents were measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Pierce). The samples (20–40 μg each) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8–12%, unless specified otherwise), which was followed by blotting to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were then probed by specific antibodies and the bands were visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Scientific) or Amersham Biosciences ECL Plus kit (GE Healthcare). Cells were lysed in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS), boiled immediately for 5 min, and then mixed with 10 volume of IP buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Tween 20). Isolated mitochondria were suspended in RIPA buffer (25 mm sucrose, 1 mm NaEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates (0.5 mg of protein each) and mitochondrial samples (0.1 mg each) were incubated with a desired antibody (0.5–1 μg) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at room temperature or 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with IP buffer, suspended in 2× SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and used for Western blot analysis. Purified porcine tubulins purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (50 μg), were incubated with 30 μm AITC in 0.2 ml of PBS containing 1% acetonitrile in a glass vial for 1 h at 37 °C. A cold acetone precipitation was performed to remove unreacted AITC and salts. The protein precipitates were recovered by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed with cold 90% acetone and air-dried. The pellets were resuspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 10% acetonitrile, and the proteins were digested by trypsin (Sequencing Grade, Promega) at a ratio of 1:10 (w/w, trypsin/protein) at 37 °C for 2 h. The hydrolysis was stopped by the addition of formic acid to a final concentration of 2%. The samples were dried and reconstituted with 2% formic acid. The tryptic digests were analyzed by liquid chromatography, nanoelectrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS) using a nanoACQUITY UPLC (Waters) coupled through a nebulization-assisted nanospray ionization source to a Q-ToF premier mass spectrometer (Waters/Micromass). MS/MS spectra were processed and transformed to the PKL file format using ProteinLynx Global Server version 2.3 (Waters/Micromass) and the default parameters of MaxEnt3 (Waters/Micromass). The PKL files were used to search a protein data base that was created using sequences obtained from GenBankTM and UniProt. Tubulin peptides modified by AITC at cysteine residues were identified by ProteinLynx Global Server and confirmed by manual inspection of the MS/MS fragment ion spectra (see supplemental material for further detail). Cells were treated with vehicle or AITC, from which total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript® II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction volume. PCRs were carried out in a total volume of 25 μl, containing 1 μl of cDNA template from the above-described reaction solution, 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 10 pmol each of the forward and reverse primers, and 1 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) under the following cycle conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. The primers included those for α-tubulin (TUBA1, forward 5′-AGTTGATTATGGCAAGAAGTCC-3′ and reverse 5′-CATCTGGTTGGCTGGCTC-3′), β-tubulin (TUBB, forward 5′-TGTTTGCTGCCTCTATCTTG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTACCCACTACCTTCTACCAT-3′), and GAPDH (forward 5′-CCAGGGCTGCTTTTAACTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTCCCCCCTGCAAATGA-3′). For Wright-Giemsa staining, cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes (1.5 × 106 cells/dish with 10 ml of medium) for 24 h and treated with solvent or AITC for 24 h. At the end of treatment, cells were harvested after trypsin treatment, washed with ice-cold PBS, and transferred to microscope slides using a Shandon Cytospin 4 from Thermo Electron Corp. Cells on the slides were dried at room temperature and stained with Wright-Giemsa solution (Sigma). After rinsing and air-drying, cover slides were affixed, and slides were analyzed by light microscopy. The percentage of mitotic figures was determined by analyzing a minimum of 150 cells in at least 20 fields per slide. For immunofluorescent staining, cells were grown on 12-mm glass cover slides placed in 6 well plates (0.3 × 106 cells/slide with 2 ml of medium in each well) for 24 h and then exposed to solvent or AITC for 24 h. After washing once with ice-cold PBS, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA in PBS) for 10 min and then treated with 10% mouse serum in PBS for 10 min. Following three more rinses with wash buffer, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with an antibody against α-tubulin. Following another three washes with wash buffer, cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min in a dark chamber. Finally, cells were washed again with wash buffer and mounted on microscope slides with mounting medium (Molecular Probes), which contained 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to counterstain DNA in cells. Fluorescence microscopy was used to analyze samples. The effects of AITC and BITC (the latter was used as a control) on tubulin polymerization were assessed using a tubulin polymerization assay kit (BK006) from Cytoskeleton, Inc., following the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, bovine brain tubulin (>99% purity) at the final concentration of 3 mg/ml was incubated with solvent or AITC or BITC at 37 °C. The reaction was carried out in pre-warmed microtiter plates. Absorbance readings at 340 nm were taken immediately and once every minute for 20 min, using a SPECTRAmax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used for comparison between two groups. One-way analysis of variance was used for multigroup comparison, followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test. Multiple human bladder cancer cell lines were used to determine whether different cell line responds differently to AITC in terms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Each cell line was treated with AITC at 0, 7.5, 15, and 30 μm for 24 h. The cells were checked either for cell cycle progression by flow cytometry or for apoptosis by a flow cytometry-based TUNEL assay. AITC caused dose-dependent and profound G2/M arrest in all cell lines examined, with a corresponding decrease of the cell population in G1 and S phases. Up to 90.1% of UM-UC-3 cells, up to 93.3% UM-UC-6 cells, and up to 74.5% of T24 cells existed in the G2/M phase after AITC treatment, compared with 12.3–14.9% of control cells that were detected in these phases (Fig. 1A). At the same time, cells undergoing apoptosis also increased markedly after AITC treatment, as shown by an increase in both subG1 population (see Figs. 2A and 3A for results of UM-UC-3 cells and results for UM-UC-6 cells and T24 cells not shown) and TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 1B). Approximately 20% of the cells were TUNEL-positive after AITC treatment at the highest dose, compared with 2.1–7.1% in the control cells (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 2Effect of AITC on mitosis and tubulins.

Arrows point to cells in mitosis or mitotic catastrophe. C, UM-UC-3 cells were treated with vehicle or AITC for 24 h and then stained for microtubules with an anti-α-tubulin antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (green color) and stained for DNA with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (blue color), which were subsequently visualized under a fluorescence microscope. D, purified bovine brain tubulin was incubated in the presence of vehicle or indicated concentrations of AITC or BITC (used as a control). Tubulin polymerization was monitored by absorbance reading at 340 nm, using an assay kit from Cytoskeleton, Inc. E, UM-UC-3 cells were treated with vehicle or AITC for 24 h and then measured for levels of α-, β-, and γ-tubulin by Western blotting. GAPDH was used as a loading control. Band intensity was scanned by a densitometer, and relative expression was calculated. Compared with the control, in cells treated with AITC at 30 μm, levels of α- and β-tubulin were reduced 47.1 ± 1.9 and 45.8 ± 8.4% (mean ± S.D., n = 3), respectively (p < 0.05). Representative blots are shown. F, UM-UC-3 cells were treated with vehicle or AITC for 24, from which total RNA was prepared for RT-PCR analysis of α- and β-tubulin, using GAPDH as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3AITC binds to tubulins and causes their ubiquitination. UM-UC-3 cells were transfected with a His-tagged Ub expression plasmid for 24 h and then treated with vehicle or AITC for 6 h, followed by Western blot analyses of α-, β-, and His tag, with GAPDH as a control (A) or by IP/immunoblot analyses of ubiquitinated α-tubulin and ubiquitinated β-tubulin (B). Note: α-tubulin and IgG were detected simultaneously on the same blot, as both the anti-α-tubulin antibody and the anti-His tag antibody were generated in the same animal species; the anti-β-tubulin and the anti-His tag were generated in different animal species, allowing detection of β-tubulin without interference by IgG. C, purified porcine tubulins were incubated with AITC at 30 μm for 1 h at 37 °C and then precipitated with acetone, followed by the identification of AITC-bound cysteine residues by mass spectrometry (see supplemental material for detail).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further understand AITC-induced cell cycle arrest, UM-UC-3 cells were treated with AITC at 15 μm for 24 h and then checked for both cell cycle arrest by flow cytometry and mitotic figures (both mitotic cells and cells with multiple micronuclei) after Wright-Giemsa staining. 53.9% of AITC-treated cells were arrested in G2/M phase versus 13.1% in control cells (Fig. 2A), which were similar to that shown in Fig. 1A. Interestingly, Wright-Giemsa staining revealed that 56.5% of AITC-treated cells were in the mitotic phase versus 8.1% in control cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, AITC caused predominantly if not entirely mitotic arrest, rather than G2 phase arrest. It is also of note that a significant population of AITC-treated cells showed multiple micronuclei (Fig. 2B), indicative of mitotic catastrophe. Simultaneous immunostaining of α-tubulin (Fig. 2C, green color) and DNA staining with DAPI (blue color) showed control cells undergoing typical mitosis and cell division (bipolar mitotic spindle and separation of sister chromosomes), whereas AITC-treated cells exhibited aberrant and multipolar mitotic spindle and lack of separation of sister chromosomes, reminiscent of the effects of vinblastine, which is a microtubule depolymerizer, and taxol, which is a microtubule stabilizer (9Jo H. Loison F. Hattori H. Silberstein L.E. Yu H. Luo H.R. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10318Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, AITC does not affect tubulin polymerization, as AITC at 50 and 100 μm had no effect on the rate of tubulin polymerization in an in vitro assay, whereas another isothiocyanate (BITC, used as a control) at the same concentrations almost completely inhibited tubulin polymerization (Fig. 2D). Further experiments showed that AITC significantly down-regulated both α- and β-tubulin, but not γ-tubulin (Fig. 2E), suggesting that α- and β-tubulin may be key AITC targets for mitotic arrest. Interestingly, AITC had no effect on the transcripts of either α-tubulin gene or β-tubulin gene (Fig. 2F), indicating that AITC likely destabilized the proteins coded by these genes. Indeed, although treatment of UM-UC-3 cells with AITC (30 μm, 6 h) decreased the levels of both α- and β-tubulin (Fig. 3A), there was a marked increase in the levels of ubiquitinated α-tubulin and ubiquitinated β-tubulin (Fig. 3B), suggesting that AITC promoted the degradation of the tubulins via the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome pathway. Similar results were obtained in cells treated with AITC at 30 μm for 3 h (data not shown). It is of note that the cells in the above experiments were transfected with a His-tagged Ub expression plasmid for 24 h before AITC treatment; in the absence of ectopic Ub expression, neither Ub-α-tubulin nor Ub-β-tubulin was detectable (data not shown). Moreover, incubation of purified porcine α-/β-tubulins with 30 μm AITC for 1 h at 37 °C resulted in binding of AITC to specific cysteine (Cys) residues, including Cys-127, Cys-347, and Cys-376 of α-tubulin, and Cys-12, Cys-239, Cys-303, and Cys-354 of β-tubulin, as shown by mass spectrometry analysis of trypsin-digested peptide fragments (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S3). However, AITC binding to the cysteine residues was reversible, as the result described above was obtained after trypsin digestion of the AITC-treated tubulins for 2 h at 37 °C, whereas no cysteine modification by AITC could be detected after overnight incubation of the AITC-treated tubulins with trypsin (data not shown). The reversible nature of AITC binding to tubulin cysteines is consistent with our inability to detect AITC binding to cysteine residues of tubulins in UM-UC-3 cells, where the cells were treated with AITC at 30 μm for 3 h, from which α-/β-tubulins were isolated by immunoprecipitation and/or gel electrophoresis before they were subjected to trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry analysis. Nevertheless, the AITC-binding cysteine residues of the porcine tubulins, as described above, are also present in human α-/β-tubulins. To further characterize mitotic arrest induced by AITC, UM-UC-3 cells were pretreated with or without 1 mm HU for 16 h and then treated with AITC at 15 and 30 μm for 24 h in the presence or absence of HU. HU is a DNA replication inhibitor and arrests cells in G1 phase. Indeed, HU completely arrested UM-UC-3 cells in G1 phase and prevented AITC from arresting cells in mitosis, as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 4, A and B). More interestingly, HU also prevented AITC from causing cell death, as subG1 population, which formed after AITC treatment (Fig. 4A), was no longer detected in cells co-treated with HU and AITC (Fig. 4B). Moreover, AITC stimulated Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser-70, although not at Ser-87 (antibodies specific for phosphorylation at each site were used), while not affecting total Bcl-2 expression (Figs. 4C and 7C). A subsequent experiment showed that AITC-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation occurred exclusively in the mitochondria (Fig. 7C). However, HU completely blocked AITC-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C), indicating that mitotic arrest is a prerequisite for AITC to induce Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Bcl-2 is a major anti-apoptotic protein, and Bcl-2 phosphorylation is well known to modulate its anti-apoptotic activity. Our finding that Bcl-2 phosphorylation was closely associated with the formation of subG1 cells after AITC treatment suggested that Bcl-2 phosphorylation might be key to AITC-induced cell death. Subsequent experiments showed that JNK was responsible for AITC-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation. UM-UC-3 cells express both JNK1 (42 and 50 kDa) and JNK2 (54 kDa), but not JNK3, as detected by Western blotting using antibodies specific for each isoform (see supplemental Fig. S1). The results shown in Fig. 5A were obtained using antibodies detecting all JNKs or JNKs that are phosphorylated at Thr-183/Tyr-185. Two Western blot bands of JNK and p-JNK were detected, corresponding to total and phosphorylated JNK1 and JNK2 (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S1). Cells were pretreated with solvent or HU for 16 h and then treated with AITC for 3 or 24 h with or without HU. In cells treated with AITC alone, although it had no effect on the expression levels of total JNK1 and JNK2, it caused rapid phosphorylation at Thr-183/Tyr-185 of JNK1 and probably JNK2 (the 50–54-kDa band likely represents both p-JNK1 and p-JNK2), as 3-h AITC treatment caused marked increase in p-JNK1/2; the effect was much attenuated after 24 h AITC treatment (Fig. 5A). Moreover, a specific JNK inhibitor (SP600125) inhibited AITC-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B), and Bcl-2 Ser-70 is a known JNK phosphorylation site (10Deng X. Xiao L. Lang W. Gao F. Ruvolo P. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23681-23688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Another JNK inhibitor XI, BI-87G3, which is structurally different from SP600125, also inhibited AITC-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation in UM-UC-3 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). These results show that AITC causes Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser-70 via JNK activation. SP600125 also inhibited AITC-induced caspase 3 activation (Fig. 5B), providing further evidence that JNK-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation is important in AITC-induced cell death. However, JNK inhibition by SP600125 had no effect on down-regulation of α-/β-tubulins by AITC (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, in cells treated with both AITC and HU, there was a sustained JNK1/2 phosphorylation and a slight increase in JNK1 expression levels (Fig. 5A) but no Bcl-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B), hinting that AITC-activated JNK is not able to phosphorylate Bcl-2 unless cells are arrested in mitosis.FIGURE 7Role of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in AITC-induced apoptosis.

However, many nuclear replicative and repair DNA polymerases incorporate ribonucleotides into DNA, suggesting that the exclusion mechanism is not perfect. In this study, we show that the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ discriminates ribonucleotides efficiently but differentially based on the base identity. Whereas UTP is discriminated by 77,000-fold compared with dTTP, the discrimination drops to 1,100-fold for GTP versus dGTP. In addition, the efficiency of the enzyme was reduced 3-14-fold, depending on the identity of the incoming nucleotide, when it extended from a primer containing a 3'-terminal ribonucleotide. DNA polymerase γ is also proficient in performing single-nucleotide reverse transcription reactions from both DNA and RNA primer terminus, although its bypass efficiency is significantly diminished with increasing stretches of ribonucleotides in template DNA. Furthermore, we show that the E895A mutant enzyme is compromised in its ability to discriminate ribonucleotides, mainly due to its defects in deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate binding, and is also a poor reverse transcriptase. The potential biochemical defects of a patient harboring a disease mutation in the same amino acid (E895G) are discussed."

Recent data have suggested that apoptosis and cell cycle arrest may contribute to the development of emphysema. In this study, we addressed the question of whether and how cigarette smoke affected Akt, which plays a critical role in cell survival and proliferation. In normal human lung fibroblasts, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) caused cell death, accompanying degradation of total and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), which was inhibited by MG132. CSE exposure resulted in preferential ubiquitination of the active Akt (myristoylated), rather than the inactive (T308A/S473A double mutant) Akt. Consistent with cytotoxicity, CSE induced a progressive decrease of phosphorylated human homolog of mouse double minute homolog 2 (p-HDM2) and phosphorylated apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (p-ASK1) with concomitant elevation of p53, p21, and phosphorylated p38 MAPK. Forced expression of the active Akt reduced both CSE-induced cytotoxicity and alteration in HDM2/p53/p21 and ASK1/p38 MAPK, compared with the inactive Akt. Of note, CSE induced expression of the tetratrico-peptide repeat domain 3 (TTC3), known as a ubiquitin ligase for active Akt. TTC3 siRNAs suppressed not only CSE-induced Akt degradation but also CSE-induced cytotoxicity. Accordingly, rat lungs exposed to cigarette smoke for 3 months showed elevated TTC3 expression and reduced Akt and p-Akt. Taken together, these data suggest that cigarette smoke induces cytotoxicity, partly through Akt degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, in which TTC3 acts as a ubiquitin ligase for active Akt.

https://openalex.org/W2044851481,"Plants respond to synthetic chemicals by eliciting a xenobiotic response (XR) that enhances the expression of detoxifying enzymes such as glutathione transferases (GSTs). In agrochemistry, the ability of safeners to induce an XR is used to increase herbicide detoxification in cereal crops. Based on the responsiveness of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to the rice safener fenclorim (4,6-dichloro-2-phenylpyrimidine), a series of related derivatives was prepared and tested for the ability to induce GSTs in cell suspension cultures. The XR in Arabidopsis could be divided into rapid and slow types depending on subtle variations in the reactivity (electrophilicity) and chemical structure of the derivatives. In a comparative microarray study, Arabidopsis cultures were treated with closely related compounds that elicited rapid (fenclorim) and slow (4-chloro-6-methyl-2-phenylpyrimidine) XRs. Both chemicals induced major changes in gene expression, including a coordinated suppression in cell wall biosynthesis and an up-regulation in detoxification pathways, whereas only fenclorim selectively induced sulfur and phenolic metabolism. These transcriptome studies suggested several linkages between the XR and oxidative and oxylipin signaling. Confirming links with abiotic stress signaling, suppression of glutathione content enhanced GST induction by fenclorim, whereas fatty acid desaturase mutants, which were unable to synthesize oxylipins, showed an attenuated XR. Examining the significance of these studies to agrochemistry, only those fenclorim derivatives that elicited a rapid XR proved effective in increasing herbicide tolerance (safening) in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2116678138,"Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) has multiple functions in homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which lead to conflicting data regarding its DNA double-strand break-repair (DSBR) functions in previous studies. To explore the effect of clinically relevant ATM mutations, we characterized DSBR between mutated EGFP genes and ATM kinase signaling in 9 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) with defined vs. 3 control LCLs without ATM mutations. Our study revealed that the DSBR phenotype in AT cells is not uniform but appears to depend on the mutation, causing up to 32-fold increased or up to 3-fold decreased activities in particular pathways. Comparison with a further 10 LCLs mutated in downstream factors (BRCA1, BRCA2, Nibrin, Rad50, and Chk2) showed that the most diametrically opposed DSBR patterns in AT cells phenocopied NBN/RAD50 or BRCA1 mutations. Notably, reexpressing wild-type ATM reversed these defects by 2.3- to 3.5-fold. Our data suggest that ATM stimulates repair proteins such as Nibrin, which execute HR, single-strand annealing (SSA), and NHEJ. Concomitantly, ATM minimizes error-prone repair (SSA and NHEJ) through activation of surveillance factors such as BRCA1. Since the outcome of the individual defect can be diametrically opposed, distinguishing repair patterns in patients with ATM mutations may also be relevant regarding therapeutic responses.—Keimling, M., Volcic, M., Csernok, A., Wieland, B., Dörk, T., Wiesmüller, L.

https://openalex.org/W2022601640,"The current paradigm for receptor-ligand dissociation kinetics assumes off-rates as functions of instantaneous force without impact from its prior history. This a priori assumption is the foundation for predicting dissociation from a given initial state using kinetic equations. Here we have invalidated this assumption by demonstrating the impact of force history with single-bond kinetic experiments involving selectins and their ligands that mediate leukocyte tethering and rolling on vascular surfaces during inflammation. Dissociation of bonds between L-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) loaded at a constant ramp rate to a constant hold force behaved as catch-slip bonds at low ramp rates that transformed to slip-only bonds at high ramp rates. Strikingly, bonds between L-selectin and 6-sulfo-sialyl Lewis X were impervious to ramp rate changes. This ligand-specific force history effect resembled the effect of a point mutation at the L-selectin surface (L-selectinA108H) predicted to contact the former but not the latter ligand, suggesting that the high ramp rate induced similar structural changes as the mutation. Although the A108H substitution in L-selectin eliminated the ramp rate responsiveness of its dissociation from PSGL-1, the inverse mutation H108A in P-selectin acquired the ramp rate responsiveness. Our data are well explained by the sliding-rebinding model for catch-slip bonds extended to incorporate the additional force history dependence, with Ala-108 playing a pivotal role in this structural mechanism. These results call for a paradigm shift in modeling the mechanical regulation of receptor-ligand bond dissociation, which includes conformational coupling between binding pocket and remote regions of the interacting molecules."

It is possible, however, that in the full-length NCX, interactions between CBD1 and CBD2 introduce new structural and dynamic effects that could be involved in allosteric Ca2+ regulation. Consistent with this hypothesis, stopped flow measurements of Ca2+ dissociation kinetics from a tandem construct, CBD12, which contains both the CBD1 and CBD2 domains connected by a short linker, showed that interdomain interactions modulate the Ca2+ dissociation rate at a specific Ca2+-binding site in the CBD1 domain (16Giladi M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 1699-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) measurements have recently demonstrated that binding of Ca2+ to CBD1 induces conformational changes in CBD12. Conformational changes in the cytoplasmic loop of full-length functional exchanger were also observed by FRET (17John S.A. Ribalet B. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Ottolia M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 1699-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the atomic details of such conformational changes remain unknown. To understand at the atomic level how binding of Ca2+ to the cytoplasmic CBD domains is involved in allosteric Ca2+ regulation of the NCX, we have pursued studies of the solution structure and dynamics of the tandem CBD12 construct by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. Measurements of backbone 15N relaxation, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), and chemical shift perturbations indicate that the two CBDs are flexibly linked in the absence of Ca2+. Binding of Ca2+ to CBD1 dramatically strengthens the dynamic coupling between the two domains by restricting the flexibility of the interdomain linker such that CBD1 and CBD2 move less freely with respect to each other. RDC analysis indicates that the overall molecular shape of CBD12 is largely elongated in the Apo and Ca2+-bound states. Based on these findings it is postulated that changes in interdomain flexibility due to Ca2+ binding are part of the allosteric Ca2+ regulation mechanism. CBD12, corresponding to residues 371–657 from canine NCX1 AD splice variant, was expressed as an eight residue His tag fusion in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (4Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Uniform labeling with 15N and 13C was achieved by overexpression in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 5 g/liter of 13C-labeled glucose and 1 g/liter of 15NH4Cl as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. Random fractional deuteration was achieved by carrying out cell growth and protein expression in D2O following standard procedures. E. coli cells were let grown in a minimal medium prepared in D2O and supplemented with the adequate isotopes, 100 μg/liter ampicilin and 25 μg/liter thiamine-HCl. This inoculum was grown overnight, until the OD reached 0.9 at which point protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm of IPTG. Induction was performed for ∼18 hs. Following cell lysis, protein purification was performed with a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen). The purified protein was desalted using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences), eluted with 20 mm Hepes pH 7.0, lyophilized and stored at −80 °C. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving CBD12 in 20 mm Hepes pH 7.0 containing 20 mm of β-mercaptoethanol and 10% D2O. Apo samples also contained 15 mm EDTA and 100 mm NaCl. Alternatively, Ca2+-bound samples contained 20 mm CaCl2 and 80 mm NaCl. Buffer exchange and protein concentration were performed using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal device (Millipore) with 10 kDa cutoff. All NMR spectra were acquired at 306 K on a Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer, equipped with a TCI cryoprobe, operating at 800 MHz proton field. Backbone resonance assignments were obtained through the analysis of TROSY versions of HNCA, HNCOCA, HNCO, HNCACO, and HNCOCACB experiments, recorded on samples containing ∼0.5 mm of 2H/15N/13C-labeled CBD12. Assignments for 78% (81%) of the backbone resonances of CBD12 in the Apo state (Ca2+-bound state) could be obtained. Most of the cross-peaks in the center of the 15N TROSY spectrum in the Apo state could not be assigned due to overlap. Unassigned residues are located in the disordered FG loop and in the segment between CBD1 and CBD2 (supplemental Fig. S1). In the Ca2+-bound state, most of the unassigned residues correspond to cross-peaks that have very low amplitude or are completely absent in the 15N TROSY spectrum (supplemental Fig. S1). RDCs were obtained from the analysis of 15N HSQC and 15N TROSY spectra acquired on samples of 445 μm 2H,15N-labeled CBD12 aligned in 6% polyacrylamide gel, in the absence or presence of Ca2+. Isotropic samples were measured under the same conditions. Peak positions in the 15N TROSY and 15N HSQC spectra were determined by fitting the cross-peaks to Gaussian functions using the Sparky software. Modeling of CBD12 based on the RDC data were performed by rotating each domain separately, so that their coordinate reference frames coincide with the frame of the respective alignment tensors. After rotation, CBD2 was translated relative to CBD1 such that the Cα atom of A502 of the two fragments superimposed. Because the RDCs are invariant under 180° rotations around the x, y, or z axis, this calculation generates 16 symmetric solutions (18Hus J.C. Salmon L. Bouvignies G. Lotze J. Blackledge M.

The requirement that the correct solution obeys steric restrictions, allowed us to identify and discard physically unrealistic models. Longitudinal (R1) and rotating-frame (R1ρ) relaxation rates, and {1H}-15N steady-state nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) were measured using standard 15N relaxation methods (20Brutscher B.

Protein samples consisted of 330 μm (Apo) or 440 μm (Ca2+-bound) 2H,15N-labeled CBD12. During the R1ρ relaxation period a spin-lock field of γNB1 /2π = 854 Hz was applied. The experimental R2 relaxation rates were obtained by correcting R1ρ for off-resonance effects using the relation R2 = R1ρ/sin2(θ) − R1(cos2(θ)/sin2(θ)), where tan(θ) = γNB1/2πΔν and Δν is the resonance offset in Hz. The recycle delay was set to 3 s for all relaxation measurements. The NOE saturation period was 3 s. The R1 and R1ρ relaxation times were determined from the fitting of the measured peak heights to an exponential decay function containing three parameters, namely the intensity at time 0, the decay rate, and a baseline offset. The uncertainty of the fitted parameters was determined by Monte Carlo simulations. The R1ρ relaxation rates were measured at two different 15N carrier frequency offsets (113 and 123 ppm); the rate that is reported for a particular residue corresponds to the lower of the two χ2 values. The translational diffusion coefficients were extracted by fitting translational diffusion decay curves as a function of gradient strength to a linear function as described in Ref. 22Chou J.J.

The uncertainties in the translational diffusion coefficients were determined from the standard deviations of the diffusion coefficients measured at several specific peak positions along the 1D DOSY spectrum of CBD12. All NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

The backbone resonance assignments were deposited in the BMRB under the accession numbers 17721 and 17722. The two Ca2+-binding domains are sequentially connected as part of the NCX intracellular loop. Analysis of the three-dimensional structures of isolated CBD1 and CBD2 indicates that a short segment comprising the six residues Asp-498 to Gly-503 connects the β-strand G of CBD1 to the β-strand A of CBD2 (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). In this segment, amino acids Asp-498, Asp-499, and Asp-500 are part of the Ca2+-binding sites Ca3 and Ca4 in CBD1 (5Nicoll D.A. Sawaya M.R. Kwon S. Cascio D. Philipson K.D. Abramson J. J. Biol.

Thus, the key questions are: how do the CBD1 and CBD2 domains interact with each other and how does Ca2+ binding to either one of the two domains modulate this interaction? NMR backbone amide 1HN and 15N chemical shifts are exquisitely sensitive to the local protein backbone conformation and the chemical environment of the nuclear spins. Because of this dependence, the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, which correlates the resonances of directly attached 15N and 1HN spins, serves as a fingerprint of the protein as each amino acid (except for Pro) gives rise to a backbone cross-peak signal. Perturbations of 1H and 15N chemical shifts due to ligand binding or protein-protein interactions are very useful to map interfaces of protein complexes or multidomain proteins. Here we use 1H and 15N NMR chemical shifts to investigate the interaction between the CBD1 and CBD2 domains in the absence and presence of Ca2+. As a first attempt to detect possible interactions between CBD1 and CBD2, we tested whether the isolated, i.e. noncovalently bonded, domains bind to each other in solution. NMR samples containing equal amounts of one domain 15N-labeled and the other one unlabeled (so that it is invisible to NMR) were prepared in the absence and presence of 20 mm of CaCl2. However, we did not observe any significant chemical shift changes in the 15N HSQC spectrum of the 15N-labeled domain upon the addition of the other (unlabeled) domain, indicating that the isolated CBDs do not bind to each other under these experimental conditions. This conclusion is consistent with other recent observations (16Giladi M. Boyman L. Mikhasenko H. Hiller R. Khananshvili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28117-28125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We then investigated how CBD1 and CBD2 interact with each other in the context of the larger CBD12 fragment. This construct corresponds to residues 371–657 of the NCX1-AD splice variant. Because of the large molecular mass of the CBD12 construct (32 kDa), we recorded 15N-TROSY experiments instead of the 15N-HSQC. Although the two experiments display the same type of spectral information, TROSY offers improved sensitivity and resolution for large molecular weight proteins at high magnetic fields (25Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). Visual inspection of the 15N TROSY spectrum of CBD12 in the absence of Ca2+ shows minor differences in cross-peak positions with respect to the 15N HSQC spectra of the individual domains (Fig. 2A). To quantify these spectral differences, we assigned the backbone resonances (1HN, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13C') of CBD12 in both the absence and presence of Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. S1). Quantitative comparison of 1H and 15N backbone chemical shifts with respect to the isolated domains in the Apo state confirms that the perturbations due to the presence of the linker are minor, i.e. smaller than 0.12 ppm (Fig. 3A). The largest changes are observed for Glu-E451 in the EF loop of CBD1, Ser-529, Ala-531, and Arg-532 in the BC loop and Met-631 and Gly-632 in the α-helix of the FG loop in CBD2 (Fig. 3A). These perturbations occur for residues that are spatially close to the interdomain linker in CBD12 (Fig. 3A), indicating the lack of a large interdomain interface. Moreover, the linker, which is relatively short, does not alter the three-dimensional structures of CBD1 and CBD2. Because of extensive spectral overlap (Fig. 2A) it was not possible to assign the resonances of segment 498–503 in the Apo state (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 3Effect of the linkage of CBD1 and CBD2 on 15N,1H chemical shifts.

A large chemical shift change is observed for Glu-451, which contacts Ca1, Ca2, and Ca3 in CBD1 via its side chain carboxyl moiety (5Nicoll D.A. Sawaya M.R. Kwon S. Cascio D. Philipson K.D. Abramson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21577-21581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Large chemical shift changes with respect to the individual domains are also observed in segment 498–503, including Asp-499 (CSP 0.1314 ppm) and Asp-500 (CSP 0.3201 ppm) that coordinate Ca3 and Ca4 in CBD1 via the side-chain carboxyl group (5Nicoll D.A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 21577-21581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the Glu-503 amide proton which is shifted to 11.69 ppm, in comparison with 9.89 ppm in CBD2 alone (Fig. 2B); the chemical shift changes stop at Ile-504, the first residue of the A β-strand in CBD2 (Fig. 3B). Similarly to the Apo state, residues Ala-531, Gly-533, Asp-565 in the BC and DE loops at the N-terminal side of CBD2, as well as Arg-627, Ala-629, Gly-632, and Arg-633 in the α-helix of the FG loop, show significant chemical shift perturbations due to the presence of the linker, pointing to their spatial proximity to CBD1. Thus, an important novel finding is that the two domains of CBD12 do not share a sizable interaction surface area when in their covalently linked form in CBD12. In both the Apo and the Ca2+-bound states the interdomain interface between CBD1 and CBD2 is restricted to the EF Ca2+ binding loop in CBD1, the BC loop and the C-terminal end of the FG loop α-helix in CBD2. The absence of extensive chemical shift changes relative to the isolated domains indicates that the overall three-dimensional structures of the two domains are unaltered by their mutual presence. It is well established that the isolated CBD1 binds Ca2+ tighter than CBD2 (4Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol.

Chem. 2009; 284: 6185-6193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The different kinetic properties of isolated CBD1 and CBD2 are consistent with NMR observations, which demonstrate that Ca2+ binding occurs in different chemical exchange regimes, namely slow exchange in the case of CBD1 (not shown) and fast exchange for CBD2 (15Breukels V. Vuister G.W. Proteins. 2010; 78: 1813-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the CBD12 construct, interdomain interactions modulate the Ca2+ dissociation rate at a specific binding site in the CBD1 domain, from which Ca2+ dissociates at a significantly slower off-rate of 0.4 s−1 (16Giladi M. Boyman L. Mikhasenko H. Hiller R. Khananshvili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28117-28125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To obtain insight into Ca2+ binding of CBD12 from a residue-level perspective, we performed a titration experiment in which changes in the 15N TROSY spectra of CBD12 were monitored in response to the increase of Ca2+ concentration in a stepwise manner. Consistent with the behavior of the isolated domains (14Hilge M. Aelen J. Foarce A. Perrakis A. Vuister G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14333-14338Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Breukels V. Vuister G.W. Proteins. 2010; 78: 1813-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Boyman L. Mikhasenko H.

Furthermore, Ca2+ binding to CBD1 occurs in the form of a slow exchange equilibrium and in an all-or-none fashion (Fig. 4A). Binding of two Ca2+ ions to CBD2 only start to occur when the Ca2+-binding sites in CBD1 reach saturation (Fig. 4B) with differentially Ca2+-bound states being in fast exchange (Fig. 4B). This result shows that the binding of regulatory Ca2+ to the exchanger occurs in the CBD1 domain first, localizing unambiguously the binding sites for which Kd values were determined previously without spatial information by calorimetric titration measurements and binding curves of 45Ca2+ (14Hilge M.

It is worth noting that CBD2 residues close to the interdomain interface shift in slow exchange as Ca2+ binds to CBD1, but they do not react to the binding of Ca2+ to CBD2, which occurs at a long-range distance (Fig. 4A). NMR titration curves of Ca2+ binding to CBD2 could be adequately fitted to a stoichiometric model involving two independent binding sites. Estimates for the macroscopic dissociation constants (Kd) are 13.6 μm for the first binding event and 45.1 μm for the second one. These values are close to the Kd values derived for the isolated CBD2 from 45Ca2+ equilibrium binding curves (5.3 and 22 μm) and NMR titration (16 and 24 μm) (15Breukels V. Vuister G.W. Proteins. 2010; 78: 1813-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16Giladi M. Boyman L. Mikhasenko H. Hiller R. Khananshvili D. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the cross-peaks of Val-514, Ile-520, Arg-547, and Gly-548, which are located at or near the Ca2+ binding loops in CBD2, do not follow a straight trajectory during titration, indicating the formation of an intermediate state in an anti-cooperative manner. These residues display analogous behavior in CBD2 alone (not shown). Negative cooperativity in Ca2+ binding with the formation of at least one intermediate state was also noted for the C2A domain of synaptotagmin I, and for the C2 domain of PKC-β (27Ubach J. Zhang X.

https://openalex.org/W2093491966,"Cullin RING ligases (CRLs), the most prolific class of ubiquitin ligase enzymes, are multimeric complexes that regulate a wide range of cellular processes. CRL activity is regulated by CAND1 (Cullin-associated Nedd8-dissociated protein 1), an inhibitor that promotes the dissociation of substrate receptor components from the CRL. We demonstrate here that COMMD1 (copper metabolism MURR1 domain-containing 1), a factor previously found to promote ubiquitination of various substrates, regulates CRL activation by antagonizing CAND1 binding. We show that COMMD1 interacts with multiple Cullins, that the COMMD1-Cul2 complex cannot bind CAND1, and that, conversely, COMMD1 can actively displace CAND1 from CRLs. These findings highlight a novel mechanism of CRL activation and suggest that CRL regulation may underlie the pleiotropic activities of COMMD1."

These drugs are selective inhibitors of Hsp90, a molecular chaperone vital for many of the activities that drive cancer progression. Mutational changes to their interaction site, the extremely conserved ATP binding site of Hsp90, would mostly be predicted to inactivate the chaperone. As a result, drug resistance should not arise readily this way. Nevertheless, Streptomyces hygroscopicus, the actinomycete that produces GdA, has evolved an Hsp90 family protein (HtpG) that lacks GdA binding. It is altered in certain of the highly conserved amino acids making contacts to this antibiotic in crystal structures of GdA bound to eukaryotic forms of Hsp90. Two of these amino acid changes, located on one side of the nucleotide-binding cleft, weakened GdA/Hsp90 binding and conferred partial GdA resistance when inserted into the endogenous Hsp90 of yeast cells. Crystal structures revealed their main effect to be a weakening of interactions with the C-12 methoxy group of the GdA ansamycin ring. This is the first study to demonstrate that partial GdA resistance is possible by mutation within the ATP binding pocket of Hsp90.—Millson, S. H., Chua, C.-S., Roe, S.

We synthesized a group of PIA-related peptides in which R1 was mutated or the RDP motif gradually removed. Binding and striatal DA release assays of native rat α6β2∗ receptors showed that the RDP sequence, and particularly residue R1, is essential for the activity of PIA. On the basis of molecular modeling analyses, we synthesized a hybrid peptide (RDP-MII) that had increased potency (7-fold) and affinity (13-fold) for α6β2∗ receptors but not for the very similar α3β2∗ subtype. As docking studies also suggested that E11 of MII might be a key residue engendering α6β2∗ vs. α3β2∗ selectivity, we prepared MII[E11R] and RDP-MII[E11R] peptides. Their affinity and potency for native α6β2∗ receptors were similar to those of their parent analogues, whereas, for the oocyte expressed rat α3β2∗ subtype, they showed a 31- and 14-fold lower affinity and 21- and 3.5-fold lower potency.

An antibiotic-resistant bacterium, which emerged first in the United Kingdom in 1961, disseminated rapidly globally and came to be known as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 3The abbreviations used are: MRSAmethicillin-resistant S. aureusCBAP2-(2′-carboxyphenyl)-benzoyl-6-aminopenicillanic acidTteslas.

Modern forms of MRSA are broadly resistant to antibiotics of various classes, but resistance to β-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, among others) is most insidious as it encompasses virtually all commercially available members of the class (3Fisher J.F.

The mechanistic basis of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in MRSA is complex for which the antibiotic sensor/signal transducer protein BlaR1 is a key player (4Llarrull L.I. Fisher J.F. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 4051-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The surface domain of BlaR1 detects the presence of the β-lactam antibiotic in the milieu. Once the antibiotic complex with the sensor domain forms, it initiates transduction of the information on antibiotic recognition to the cytoplasmic domain, which is a zinc-dependent protease (Fig. 1A) (6Zhang H.Z. Hackbarth C.J. Chansky K.M. Chambers H.F. Science. 2001; 291: 1962-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).

The recognition at the surface domain is not merely a complex formation between the antibiotic and the sensor domain, but rather involves covalent chemistry. Antibiotic acylates Ser-389, resulting in an acyl-protein complex. Furthermore, we had detected by spectroscopy that the sensor domain experiences the uncommon posttranslational modification of N-carboxylation at the side chain of Lys-392, a residue within the antibiotic-binding site (8Thumanu K.

We document herein for the first time by x-ray crystallography that the apo form of the sensor domain of BlaR1 from S. aureus is indeed N-carboxylated at the side chain of Lys-392. We also document by a series of two- and three-dimensional solution NMR experiments that contiguity exists in the covalent connectivities of the side-chain atoms of N-carboxylated Lys-392, an arrangement that is lost on binding to the β-lactam antibiotics, leading to unmodified Lys-392. NMR experiments revealed that the side chain of N-carboxylated Lys-392 in the native protein is highly mobile in solution in the picosecond time regime, the mechanistic significance of which was investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that the complex of the antibiotic with the sensor domain does not experience N-recarboxylation at the side chain of Lys-392 even in the presence of excess carbon dioxide, a critical event that is at the root of BlaR1 serving as a sensor domain of β-lactam antibiotics. This unique property, for which we provide herein a structural basis, is at the root of the antibiotic sensing event, central in induction of resistance in MRSA. Detailed experimental techniques used for site-directed mutagenesis, expression, and purification of BlaRS are provided with the supplemental data. Computational methods used are also described there together with the associated references and additional figures. Crystals of BlaRS were grown at 24 °C from either 30% PEG 8000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate at pH 6.5 buffered with sodium cacodylate (native protein and protein with imipenem and meropenem) or 30% PEG 4000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate at pH 8.5 buffered with Tris (protein with CBAP) using protein concentrations of 3 mg/ml. Prior to data collection, crystals were briefly transferred to mother liquor that had been supplemented with 20% glycerol for cryo-protection, and then they were flash-frozen in the liquid nitrogen. Antibiotics were dissolved in the cryo-protective solution to a concentration of 3–5 mg/ml. For soaking, BlaRS crystals were soaked in these solutions for ∼2 h. Although this strategy was successful with imipenem and meropenem, soaking was unsuccessful with CBAP, leading instead to crystal cracking and dissolution within 2 min. Crystals of BlaRS complexed with CBAP were thus obtained by co-crystallization, with 75 μl of CBAP in water at 5 mg/ml added to 900 μl of crystallization buffer. Diffraction data were collected at beamlines 19BM and 21ID at the Advanced Photon Source. Oscillation frames were integrated and scaled with HKL2000 (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Waters were added using ARP/wARP (16Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Graphical evaluation of the model and fitting to maps were performed using Coot (17Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23384) Google Scholar) and XtalView (18McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). A composite omit map, a composite of density maps in which 5% of the structure was iteratively omitted and maps calculated using simulated annealing and energy minimization to reduce bias, were calculated using the CNS module as implemented in Discovery Studio 3.0 (Accelrys, Inc.) and used to validate the electron density for the N-carboxylated lysine in the apo BlaRS protein. The quality of the structures during and after refinement was monitored with the Coot validation engine, Procheck (19Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the WHATIF template structure check (20Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The side-chain orientations of Gln, Asn, and His were validated using MolProbity (21Word J.M. Lovell S.C. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in supplemental Table S1. U-15N/80% 2H-labeled BlaRS was overexpressed at 25 °C in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen), transformed with the expression vector pET24a(+)_BlaRS. We used the protocol of Marley et al. (22Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), with the initial growth in rich LB medium followed by overexpression in M9 minimal media containing [15N]-NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source and 100% D2O for perdeuteration. BlaRS was then purified chromatographically from the bacterial lysate per reported procedures (9Golemi-Kotra D. Cha J.Y. Meroueh S.O. Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18419-18425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For lysine N-carboxylation, we included 20 mm NaH13CO3 as described previously (9Golemi-Kotra D. Cha J.Y. Meroueh S.O. Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18419-18425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which gave 550 μm 13CO2. This 13CO2 concentration is well above the Kd for carbon dioxide binding to BlaRS Kd = 0.6 ± 0.2 μm (9Golemi-Kotra D. Cha J.Y. Meroueh S.O. Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18419-18425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and the final BlaRS concentration (150 μm). The final NMR buffer conditions (after NaH13CO3 addition) were 30 mm sodium phosphate, 20 mm NaCl, 0.2% NaN3, 10% D2O, maintaining pH at 7.5. NMR spectra were recorded at 16.4 and 18.8 T, using Bruker Avance spectrometers equipped with cryogenically cooled TCI probes. Three-dimensional HNCO and two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra for the carbamate assignment and antibiotic additions (see Fig. 3) were recorded at 16.4 T, 295 K and used 1H-detected transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy schemes (23Salzmann M.

We carried out the 15N spin relaxation measurements at 18.8 and 16.4 T, 295 K, using sensitivity-enhanced, two-dimensional 1H-detected pulse schemes (25Dayie K.T. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. Series A. 1994; 111: 121-126Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 26Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar, 27Palmer A.G. Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The R2 experiments used the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill spin lock, corrected for cross-correlated relaxation artifacts (28Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Chazin W.J. Wright P.E. Rance M. Mol. Phys. 1992; 75: 699-711Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 29Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar). The Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill carrier was applied on-resonance with the carbamate 15N and used 160-μs 15N refocusing pulses with interpulse delays of 900 μs. The relaxation delays were 0.86, 0.17, 0.34, 0.52 (2×), 0.86, 1.03, 1.46, 1.98, and 2.58 s for the R1 series and 8.5, 17.0 (2×), 25.4, 33.9, 42.4, 50.9, 59.4, 76.3, 84.8, and 93.3 ms for the R2 series. The experiments produced files of cross-peak intensity versus relaxation delay, which were then fit to single exponential decays using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Analysis of the 15N R2/R1 ratios for the backbone NHs (26Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar) gave an estimated overall rotational correlation time τm = 15.0 ± 0.2 ns/radian. The fits of the decay curves, the subsequent extraction of the Lipari-Szabo internal motion parameters (S2 and τe), and the attendant Monte Carlo error analyses based on duplicate spectra were performed using previously described methods and in-house software (30Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8571-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Screening of the conditions for growth of crystals of the sensor domain (hereafter referred to as BlaRS), including those previously shown to result in diffracting crystals (11Wilke M.S. Hills T.L. Zhang H.Z. Chambers H.F. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47278-47287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), generated cubic crystals that diffracted to no better than 4-Å resolution at synchrotron sources, similar to what had been reported earlier (10Birck C. Cha J.Y. Cross J. Schulze-Briese C. Meroueh S.O. Schlegel H.B. Mobashery S. Samama J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13945-13947Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As the wild-type sequence failed to crystallize to high resolution, we pursued a different strategy in which select surface lysines were replaced with alanine to minimize entropic factors inhibiting optimal crystal growth. This type of strategy has been successful in other systems (31Cooper D.R. Boczek T. Grelewska K. Pinkowska M. Sikorska M. Zawadzki M. Derewenda Z. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The gene for a triple mutant variant of the sensor domain (K369A/K370A/K372A) was cloned. The protein was expressed and purified to homogeneity. This mutant variant gave crystals that diffracted to 2.2-Å resolution and permitted determination of the structure by molecular replacement (supplemental Table S1). The overall structure was the same as those reported previously for BlaRS from S. aureus and Bacillus licheniformis (10Birck C. Cha J.Y. Cross J. Schulze-Briese C. Meroueh S.O. Schlegel H.B. Mobashery S. Samama J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13945-13947Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Wilke M.S. Hills T.L. Zhang H.Z. Chambers H.F. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12835-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), consisting of an α/β fold that closely resembles structures of class D β-lactamases. There were two molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by a non-crystallographic two-fold axis of symmetry. The structures of the two molecules were nearly identical, superimposing with backbone and all-atom root mean square deviation values of 0.3 and 0.7 Å, respectively. Despite these similarities, a key difference was seen for Lys-392 within the antibiotic-binding sites of the two. Although Lys-392 in the first molecule was unmodified, as seen in the earlier structure for BlaRS from S. aureus (11Wilke M.S. Hills T.L. Zhang H.Z. Chambers H.F. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47278-47287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the second protein molecule exhibited additional density contiguous to the Lys-392 Nζ atom. The presence of this additional density was confirmed through the calculation of an unbiased composite omit map (supplemental Fig. S1). This additional density was larger and more unusually shaped than typically seen for a water molecule but too small to accommodate additional ligands such as sulfate or glycerol. Further, the peak density was situated too close to the lysine side-chain nitrogen to permit a non-covalent interaction. Overall, this density was most compatible with the presence of an N-carboxylated lysine, the existence of which was alluded to in the earlier spectroscopic studies (Fig. 2A). Its observation in just one of two molecules in the asymmetric unit, together with the previous structure showing only an unmodified lysine (11Wilke M.S. Hills T.L. Zhang H.Z. Chambers H.F. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47278-47287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), is consistent with a reversible N-carboxylation reaction; as will be elaborated, this reversibility has mechanistic implications for the activation of the sensor domain. In the protein molecule with the unmodified lysine, the Nζ of Lys-392 points toward solvent and forms a number of hydrogen bonds with polar side chains within the active site, including those of Asn-439 and Ser-389. The protein with the unmodified Lys-392 is not active, as disclosed in an earlier study (8Thumanu K. Cha J. Fisher J.F. Perrins R. Mobashery S. Wharton C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10630-10635Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Lys-392 has rotated nearly 180° about its δ carbon in the protein molecule with N-carboxylated lysine. This conformation does not allow an interaction with the side chain of Ser-389, but one with Asn-439 is still retained (Fig. 2B). It is known that N-carboxylated Lys-392 promotes/activates Ser-389 for acylation by the antibiotic (8Thumanu K. Cha J. Fisher J.F. Perrins R. Mobashery S. Wharton C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10630-10635Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); hence, this crystallographic conformation for N-carboxylated Lys-392 was initially a puzzle. As we will see by the forthcoming discussion on NMR analysis of the protein, N-carboxylated Lys-392 is highly mobile within the antibiotic-binding site, a feature critical for activation of Ser-389 for the acylation event. The observed NMR mobility of the residue is supported by the crystallographic B-factors for the atoms of the side chain of the N-carboxylated Lys-392, which are as much as three standard deviations above the average for the protein (this calculation excludes the atoms of the first seven amino acid residues, for which only weak electron density was observed) (supplemental Fig. S2). The presence of N-carboxylated Lys-392 in BlaRS was also documented by two-dimensional- and three-dimensional-NMR experiments in solution (see supplemental Results for details). The resonance line widths of the carbamate and amide 15N-1H bond vectors are governed by the same spin relaxation mechanisms. However, the carbamate 15N and 1H line-widths were much narrower than most of the BlaRS backbone NH groups, suggesting enhanced local mobility. To quantify this, we measured 15N spin relaxation parameters at 295 K (spin lattice relaxation rate, R1 = 1/T1 and spin-spin relaxation rate, R2 = 1/T2 at 18.8 T and R1 at 16.4 T) for the individual NH bond vectors of BlaRS. For the carbamate NζH bond, we extracted the dynamics information from these rates using the formalism of Lipari and Szabo (32Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3399) Google Scholar, 33Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1872) Google Scholar), which assigns each NH bond vector a site-specific order parameter S2 and internal motion correlation time, τe. These parameters describe the amplitude (S2) and time scale (τe) for the re-orientational motions of the NH bond vector due to conformational dynamics. S2 lies between 1 and 0, becoming smaller for larger amplitude motions. We found for the carbamate that S2 = 0.16 ± 0.02, and τe = 210 ± 50 ps. These values indicated that the carbamate moiety underwent large amplitude internal motions on the picosecond time scale. Further evidence of high local mobility was the observation that 1H-1H NOE cross-relaxation between the carbamate NζH proton and other protons (within ∼5 Å) occurred only at lower temperature (278 K). At 295 K, these 1H-1H NOE cross-peaks disappeared. This reveals that at 295 K, the 1H-1H NOE cross-relaxation is averaged out by large amplitude motion of the N-carboxylated lysine. To our knowledge, the NMR study reported herein is the first experimental investigation of the dynamics of N-carboxylated lysine in proteins. Collectively, these experimental data reveal that the NζH, and thus, the side chain of N-carboxylated Lys-392, undergoes large amplitude subnanosecond motion. NMR spectra of BlaRS showed that the addition of β-lactam antibiotic causes N-decarboxylation of Lys-392. Specifically, we added either penicillin G or CBAP to BlaRS (17 mm penicillin G or 16 mm CBAP and 150 μm BlaRS) and then monitored the effects on the carbamate 15N-1H cross-peak in heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra. For both reactions, the cross-peak intensity decreased steadily over time. Fig. 3, B and C, show 1H cross-sections of this cross-peak for time points subsequent to the addition of the antibiotic. At the end of monitoring, the cross-peak had diminished by 80% for penicillin G and 70% for CBAP. The progressive decrease in the resonance is a direct consequence of the disappearance of the carbamate species, caused by N-decarboxylation of Lys-392. It is important to note that these experiments were performed in the presence of excess of 13CO2, which indicates that on acylation of the protein by the antibiotic and the attendant N-decarboxylation of Lys-392, the carbamate cannot readily reform. The implication of this observation is that N-decarboxylation of Lys-392 keeps the sensor domain in the acylated (“on”) state. The mobility of the N-carboxylated Lys-392 side chain, as suggested by crystallographic temperature factors and directly observed through NMR, was simulated by molecular dynamics (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). The present x-ray crystal structure places the side chain of N-carboxylated Lys-392 in an extended conformation in the active site. This extended conformation positions the side chain away from the Ser-389 side-chain hydroxyl, resulting in no interactions between the two. We additionally note that in class D OXA10 β-lactamase, among other class D enzymes, the active-site lysine corresponding to Lys-392 of BlaR1 is N-carboxylated and that the N-carboxylated side chain is in hydrogen-bonding contact with the active-site serine, an arrangement not seen in the x-ray structure of BlaR1 reported herein (Figs. 2A and 4A). Consistent with the NMR findings, our molecular dynamics simulations show that N-carboxylated Lys-392 is highly mobile. The side chain moves from the extended conformation seen in the x-ray structure in the direction of Ser-389 to achieve a conformation that facilitates hydrogen bonding with serine hydroxyl. Approximately 50% of the 50,000 conformations sampled over a 100-ns period demonstrate hydrogen-bonding contact between the hydroxyl group of Ser-389 and one oxygen of the N-carboxylated Lys-392 or the other (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the experimental picosecond time regime measured by NMR for mobility of the N-carboxylated Lys-392, the 100 ns of simulations revealed that hydrogen bonds between Ser-389 and Lys-392 form and break repeatedly (Fig. 5, B and C). The hydrogen bond between the N-carboxylate oxygen of Lys-392 and the side-chain amide of Asn-439, as seen in the x-ray crystal structure, was conserved in 55% of the snapshots from the simulations. The collective information from the x-ray structures, the NMR experiments, and the simulations are revealing as to the mechanism of action of the sensor domain in detection of β-lactam antibiotics by BlaR1. Notwithstanding the high similarity of the structures of class D β-lactamases and the sensor domain of BlaR1, it is clear that the former is an enzyme with catalytic ability (many turnovers), whereas the latter is a receptor and devoid of turnover chemistry. For the sensor domain to function as a receptor, it should experience acylation by the antibiotic, but the complex should have longevity such that mobilization of induction of resistance in the bacterium could take place. We see this exactly in the complex of antibiotics and BlaRS. What is the structural basis that arrests the events at the acyl-protein complex stage for BlaR1, in contrast to the case of class D β-lactamases, which experience deacylation in completing the catalytic turnover process? The structures of the class D β-lactamases are highly similar to that of BlaRS, both in the overall fold and within the antibiotic-binding sites. We now know that the corresponding active-site lysines in class D β-lactamases (34Johnson J.W. Gretes M. Goodfellow V.J. Marrone L. Heynen M.L. Strynadka N.C. Dmitrienko G.I. J. Am. Chem.

However, the conformations of the N-carboxylated lysines, as seen from the respective x-ray structures, are different in the two cases. In both class D β-lactamases (38Bou G. Santillana E. Sheri A.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10630-10635Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the role of N-carboxylated lysine is the critical promotion of the active-site serine for acylation by the antibiotic. As class D β-lactamases enjoy symmetry in catalysis (42Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S. Tranier S. Ishiwata A. Kotra L.P. Samama J.-P. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6132-6133Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), N-carboxylated lysine promotes/activates a water molecule for the deacylation event as well, a function that BlaR1 is incapable of performing as it experiences N-decarboxylation on acylation by the antibiotic. It is known that the N-decarboxylated Lys-392 of BlaR1 is incapable of promoting the deacylation step (8Thumanu K. Cha J. Fisher J.F. Perrins R. Mobashery S. Wharton C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10630-10635Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, our simulations of the dynamics of the BlaR1 sensor domain showed that N-carboxylated Lys-392 is well poised to promote acylation of Ser-389 only after it assumes a conformation that closely approximates that of the class D β-lactamase. The NMR experiment in this study showed that acylation of the sensor domain by antibiotics entails loss of N-carboxylation at Lys-392, which incidentally cannot readily be reversed, even in the presence of excess carbon dioxide. This lack of reversal is at the root of the BlaR1 function as a receptor. We have termed this process the “lysine N-decarboxylation switch.” This event locks the sensor domain in its activated (on) state. One simple and plausible explanation for this lack of reversal could be that on N-decarboxylation, the side chain of Lys-392 becomes protonated and charged. Our molecular dynamics simulations, however, shed light on an additional possibility. Of the many interactions that we monitored within the antibiotic-binding site of the sensor domain, the hydrogen-bonding interaction between the side chains of Lys-392 and Asn-439 and a water molecule stood out. We noted that Asn-439 is conserved in all BlaR1 (and in the related MecR1) sequences available, except for BlaR1 from B. licheniformis and Brevibacillus brevis, where it is substituted by threonine; hence, the hydrogen-bonding ability by the side chain at position 439 is retained in all cases. We observed that these hydrogen bonds exist regardless of whether Lys-392 is N-carboxylated or not. If Lys-392 is N-carboxylated, the hydrogen-bonding contact is between one of the carbamate oxygen atoms and hydrogen atoms of Nδ of Asn-439. If Lys-392 is N-decarboxylated, the hydrogen bond is between hydrogen atoms on Nζ of Lys-392 and Oδ of Asn-439. These hydrogen bonds solvate the side chain of N-decarboxylated Lys-392 in the antibiotic complex and attenuate its ability to experience N-recarboxylation. Hence, the activated surface domain enjoys sufficient longevity that lasts the duration of the doubling time by MRSA. This mechanistic basis is at the root of evolution of function of BlaR1 as an antibiotic sensor. We would like to close with one final observation of general importance. It has been predicted that nature might have a mere 2700 unique folds for proteins (not all discovered yet) (43Liu X. Fan K. Wang W. Proteins. 2004; 54: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Considering that most genomes (microbial or more complex organisms) have more than 2700 open reading frames, this implies that nature uses the same structural template multiples of times for evolution of disparate functions in proteins. This work is a clear example of this thesis in that BlaR1 shares a nearly identical structure with those of class D β-lactamases, yet the two classes of proteins have diverged in their functions entirely; one is an antibiotic receptor protein, and the other is an antibiotic resistance enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2032826317,"In mammalian cells, the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the mevalonate pathway, is ubiquitylated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome when mevalonate-derived metabolites accumulate, representing a case of metabolically regulated endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Here, we studied which mevalonate-derived metabolites signal for HMGR degradation and the ERAD step(s) in which these metabolites are required. In HMGR-deficient UT-2 cells that stably express HMGal, a chimeric protein between β-galactosidase and the membrane region of HMGR, which is necessary and sufficient for the regulated ERAD, we tested inhibitors specific to different steps in the mevalonate pathway. We found that metabolites downstream of farnesyl pyrophosphate but upstream to lanosterol were highly effective in initiating ubiquitylation, dislocation, and degradation of HMGal. Similar results were observed for endogenous HMGR in cells that express this protein. Ubiquitylation, dislocation, and proteasomal degradation of HMGal were severely hampered when production of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate was inhibited. Importantly, inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation markedly attenuated ubiquitylation and dislocation, implicating for the first time a geranylgeranylated protein(s) in the metabolically regulated ERAD of HMGR."

https://openalex.org/W2060664433,"Homing endonucleases have great potential as tools for targeted gene therapy and gene correction, but identifying variants of these enzymes capable of cleaving specific DNA targets of interest is necessary before the widespread use of such technologies is possible. We identified homologues of the LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease I-AniI and their putative target insertion sites by BLAST searches followed by examination of the sequences of the flanking genomic regions. Amino acid substitutions in these homologues that were located close to the target site DNA, and thus potentially conferring differences in target specificity, were grafted onto the I-AniI scaffold. Many of these grafts exhibited novel and unexpected specificities. These findings show that the information present in genomic data can be exploited for endonuclease specificity redesign."

https://openalex.org/W2021716138,"To select residues in coagulation factor XIa (FXIa) potentially important for substrate and inhibitor interactions, we examined the crystal structure of the complex between the catalytic domain of FXIa and the Kunitz protease inhibitor (KPI) domain of a physiologically relevant FXIa inhibitor, protease nexin 2 (PN2). Six FXIa catalytic domain residues (Glu(98), Tyr(143), Ile(151), Arg(3704), Lys(192), and Tyr(5901)) were subjected to mutational analysis to investigate the molecular interactions between FXIa and the small synthetic substrate (S-2366), the macromolecular substrate (factor IX (FIX)) and inhibitor PN2KPI. Analysis of all six Ala mutants demonstrated normal K(m) values for S-2366 hydrolysis, indicating normal substrate binding compared with plasma FXIa; however, all except E98A and K192A had impaired values of k(cat) for S-2366 hydrolysis. All six Ala mutants displayed deficient k(cat) values for FIX hydrolysis, and all were inhibited by PN2KPI with normal values of K(i) except for K192A, and Y5901A, which displayed increased values of K(i). The integrity of the S1 binding site residue, Asp(189), utilizing p-aminobenzamidine, was intact for all FXIa mutants. Thus, whereas all six residues are essential for catalysis of the macromolecular substrate (FIX), only four (Tyr(143), Ile(151), Arg(3704), and Tyr(5901)) are important for S-2366 hydrolysis; Glu(98) and Lys(192) are essential for FIX but not S-2366 hydrolysis; and Lys(192) and Tyr(5901) are required for both inhibitor and macromolecular substrate interactions."
