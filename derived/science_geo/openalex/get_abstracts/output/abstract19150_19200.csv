https://openalex.org/W2099907467,"A cellular phosphoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kd (p90) that forms a complex with both mutant and wild-type p53 protein has been characterized, purified, and identified. The protein was identified as a product of the murine double minute 2 gene (mdm-2). The mdm-2 gene enhances the tumorigenic potential of cells when it is overexpressed and encodes a putative transcription factor. To determine if mdm-2 could modulate p53 transactivation, a p53-responsive element from the muscle creatine kinase gene was employed. A wild-type p53-expressing plasmid enhanced the expression of the p53-responsive element when cotransfected into cells that contain no endogenous p53. When a cosmid expressing mdm-2 was transfected with this p53-expressing plasmid, the transactivation of the p53-responsive element was inhibited. Thus, a product of the mdm-2 oncogene forms a tight complex with the p53 protein, and the mdm-2 oncogene can inhibit p53-mediated transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2061449183,"Although it has been demonstrated that discrete origins of DNA replication exist in eukaryotic cellular chromosomes, the detailed organization of a eukaryotic cellular origin remains to be determined. Linker substitution mutations were constructed across the entire Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomal origin, ARS1. Functional studies of these mutants revealed one essential element (A), which includes a match to the ARS consensus sequence, and three additional elements (B1, B2, and B3), which collectively are also essential for origin function. These four elements arranged exactly as in ARS1, but surrounded by completely unrelated sequence, functioned as an efficient origin. Element B3 is the binding site for the transcription factor-origin binding protein ABF1. Other transcription factor binding sites substitute for the B3 element and a trans-acting transcriptional activation domain is required. The multipartite nature of a chromosomal replication origin and the role of transcriptional activators in its function present a striking similarity to the organization of eukaryotic promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1988812517,"A hybrid receptor was constructed that contained the extracellular binding domain of the human growth hormone (hGH) receptor linked to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the murine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. Addition of hGH to a myeloid leukemia cell line (FDC-P1) that expressed the hybrid receptor caused proliferation of these cells. The mechanism for signal transduction of the hybrid receptor required dimerization because monoclonal antibodies to the hGH receptor were agonists whereas their monovalent fragments were not. Receptor dimerization occurs sequentially—a receptor binds to site 1 on hGH, and then a second receptor molecule binds to site 2 on hGH. On the basis of this sequential mechanism, which may occur in many other cytokine receptors, inactive hGH analogs were designed that were potent antagonists to hGH-induced cell proliferation. Such antagonists could be useful for treating clinical conditions of hGH excess, such as acromegaly."
https://openalex.org/W2042471874,"Partial complexes of the T cell antigen receptor lacking zeta chains are delivered to lysosomes. Chimeric proteins composed of the Tac antigen fused to the cytoplasmic domains of each CD3 chain has allowed the identification of lysosomal targeting sequences. Tac-gamma and Tac-delta chimeras are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum because of the presence of basic residues reminiscent of sequences responsible for the localization of endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. Truncation of these retention motifs revealed lysosomal targeting of both Tac-gamma and delta chimeras. A di-leucine- and a tyrosine-based motif are individually sufficient to induce both endocytosis and delivery to lysosomes of Tac. In contrast with chimeras containing only one of these motifs, the chimera containing both was predominantly delivered directly to lysosomes without going through the cell surface. These two sequences may represent two families of targeting motifs that determine the fate of proteins within the peripheral membrane system."

https://openalex.org/W1556677948,"A potent and structurally novel antimicrobial peptide was purified from the cytoplasmic granules of bovine neutrophils. Suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were virtually sterilized by the peptide at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml. The peptide was found to be comprised of 13 amino acids, 5 of which were tryptophan residues, and the carboxyl-terminal arginine was carboxamidated. The primary structure of the peptide, which we have named indolicidin, is H-Ile-Leu-Pro-Trp-Lys-Trp-Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro-Trp-Arg-Arg-NH2. The mole percent of tryptophan in indolicidin is the highest observed among known protein sequences. The multiple tryptophan residues presumably play an important role in the function of this unique antibiotic peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2053142169,"B lymphocytes and macrophages express closely related immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc receptors (Fc gamma RII) that differ only in the structures of their cytoplasmic domains. Because of cell type-specific alternative messenger RNA splicing, B-cell Fc gamma RII contains an insertion of 47 amino acids that participates in determining receptor function in these cells. Transfection of an Fc gamma RII-negative B-cell line with complementary DNA's encoding the two splice products and various receptor mutants indicated that the insertion was responsible for preventing both Fc gamma RII-mediated endocytosis and Fc gamma RII-mediated antigen presentation. The insertion was not required for Fc gamma RII to modulate surface immunoglobulin-triggered B-cell activation. Instead, regulation of activation involved a region of the cytoplasmic domain common to both the lymphocyte and macrophage receptor isoforms. In contrast, the insertion did contribute to the formation of caps in response to receptor cross-linking, consistent with suggestions that the lymphocyte but not macrophage form of the receptor can associate with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1965246206,"Genetic evidence indicates central roles for Hsp70 chaperones in the regulation of heat shock gene expression. This regulatory function has been postulated for Escherichia coli to rely on the direct association of DnaK (Hsp70) with the heat shock transcription factor sigma 32. This report presents evidence for the physical association of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE chaperones with sigma 32 in vivo. Surprisingly, an interaction of DnaJ with sigma 32 exists that is distinguishable from an interaction of DnaK and GrpE with sigma 32: addition of ATP disrupts the association of DnaK and GrpE with sigma 32, but not the association of DnaJ with sigma 32. Furthermore, DnaJ-sigma 32 and DnaK-sigma 32 associations occur independent of DnaK and DnaJ, respectively. These results suggest distinct regulatory functions of DnaJ and DnaK/GrpE."
https://openalex.org/W2138658167,"Stimulation via cytokine receptors such as IL-2 and IL-3 receptors, but not by the EGF receptor (EGFR), induces cells of the BAF-B03 hematopoietic cell line to transit the cell cycle. We demonstrate that the IL-2 receptor beta chain (IL-2R beta) is linked to at least two intracellular signaling pathways. One pathway may involve a protein tyrosine kinase of the src family, which leads to the induction of the c-jun and c-fos genes, among others. A second pathway, involving an as yet unknown mechanism, leads to c-myc gene induction. Stimulation of the EGFR, expressed following transfection of an appropriate recombinant construct, can activate the former, but not the latter, pathway in this cell line and cause the cells to enter S phase but not progress further. This deficiency can be rescued by ectopic expression of the c-myc gene, indicating a novel role for this proto-oncogene in the S to G2/M transition of the cell cycle."

The estimated annual economic value of avoiding these effects is nearly $10 billion. Attaining air pollution standards may save 1600 lives a year in the region."
https://openalex.org/W1594044971,"Recombinant plant plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase has been produced in a yeast expression system comprising a multicopy plasmid and the strong promoter of the yeast PMA1 gene. Western blotting with a specific monoclonal antibody showed that the plant ATPase is one of the major membrane proteins made by the transformed cells, accounting for about 1% of total yeast protein. The plant ATPase synthesized in yeast is fully active. It hydrolyzes ATP, pumps protons, and the reaction cycle involves a phosphorylated intermediate. Phosphorylation is possible from both ATP and Pi. Unlike the situation in plants, however, most of the plant ATPase is not expressed in the yeast plasma membrane. Rather, the enzyme appears to remain trapped at a very early stage of secretory pathway: insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum. This organelle was observed to proliferate in the form of stacked membranes surrounding the yeast nucleus in order to accommodate the large amount of plant ATPase produced. In this location, the plant ATPase can be purified with high yield (70 mg from 1 kg of yeast) from membranes devoid of endogenous yeast plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase. This convenient expression system could be useful for other eukaryotic membrane proteins and ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W1584384646,"The primary sequence of the rabbit liver cDNA coding for protein has been determined. The protein binds to the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp 90) and is associated with it, including when hsp 90 participates in hetero-oligomeric complexes of untransformed mammalian steroid receptors that sediment at 8-10 S. The cloned cDNA codes for an open reading frame of 458 amino acids defining a yet unknown protein. However, 55% amino acid homology to peptidyl-prolyl isomerase is found between amino acids 41 and 137, suggesting rotamase activity for p59, which speculatively may apply to bound hsp 90 and thus be implied in the intracellular trafficking of hetero-oligomeric forms of steroid hormone receptors. A polyclonal antibody derived from the COOH-terminal peptide 441-458 demonstrates a good affinity for rabbit, rat, and human p59 protein. It interacts with at least one epitope, available in 8-10 S untransformed steroid receptor complexes and different from that recognized by the monoclonal antibody KN382/EC-1."
https://openalex.org/W1597612174,"The effects of thapsigargin (TG), a specific inhibitor of intracellular Ca(2+)-ATPases, were studied on vesicular fragments of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes. Inhibition of Ca2+ transport and ATPase activity was observed following stoichiometric titration of the membrane bound enzyme with TG. When Ca2+ binding to the enzyme was measured in the absence of ATP, or when one cycle of Ca(2+)-dependent enzyme phosphorylation by ATP was measured under conditions preventing turnover, protection against TG by Ca2+ was observed. The protection by Ca2+ disappeared if the phosphoenzyme was allowed to undergo turnover, indicating that a state reactive to TG is produced during enzyme turnover, whereby a dead end complex with TG is formed. Enzyme phosphorylation with Pi, ATP synthesis, and Ca2+ efflux by the ATPase in its reverse cycling were also inhibited by TG. However, under selected conditions (millimolar Ca2+ in the lumen of the vesicles, and 20% dimethyl sulfoxide in the medium) TG permitted very low rates of enzyme phosphorylation with Pi and ATP synthesis in the presence of ADP. It is concluded that the mechanism of ATPase inhibition by TG involves mutual exclusion of TG and high affinity binding of external Ca2+, as well as strong (but not total) inhibition of other partial reactions of the ATPase cycle. TG reacts selectively with the state acquired by the ATPase in the absence of Ca2+. This state is obtained either by enzyme exposure to EGTA, or by utilization of ATP and consequent displacement of bound Ca2+ during catalytic turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1495954528,"An early event in T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-mediated signal transduction is the activation of a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) pathway. An unidentified PTK activity and a kinase substrate termed ZAP-70 have previously been shown to associate with TCR zeta upon cross-linking of TCR beta. Here we report that TCR activation, by antibody cross-linking of either TCR beta or CD3 epsilon, results in the association of a PTK activity with both CD3 and TCR zeta. A number of in vitro PTK substrates are also associated with CD3 and TCR zeta, including CD3 epsilon, TCR zeta, p60fyn, p62yes, and a predominant 70-kDa protein (ZAP-70). The shared PTK activity and PTK substrates suggest that both CD3 and TCR zeta are involved in signal transduction via a shared pathway. We used [alpha-32P]gamma-azidoanilido ATP, a photoreactive analogue of ATP, to detect CD3-associated proteins that bound ATP upon TCR activation, reasoning that such proteins could represent PTKs. A 70-kDa protein bound [alpha-32P]gamma-azidoanilido ATP only upon TCR activation, and we propose that this protein and the 70-kDa PTK substrate are the same protein. Furthermore, we propose that this protein is responsible for the PTK activity observed to be associated with TCR zeta and CD3 upon TCR activation."
https://openalex.org/W1548845294,"The Escherichia coli ferric enterobactin esterase gene (fes) was cloned into the vector pGEM3Z under the control of the T7 gene 10 promoter and overexpressed to approximately 15% of the total cellular protein. The ferric enterobactin esterase (Fes) enzyme was purified as a 43-kDa monomer by gel filtration chromatography. Purified Fes preparations were examined for esterase activity on enterobactin and its metal complexes and for iron reduction from ferric complexes of enterobactin and 1,3,5-tris(N,N',N-2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)aminomethylbenzene (MECAM), a structural analog lacking ester linkages. Fes effectively catalyzed the hydrolysis of both enterobactin and its ferric complex, exhibiting a 4-fold greater activity on the free ligand. It also cleaved the aluminum (III) complex at a rate similar to the ferric complex, suggesting that ester hydrolysis of the ligand backbone is independent of any reductive process associated with the bound metal. Ferrous iron was released from the enterobactin complex at a rate similar to ligand cleavage indicating that hydrolysis and iron reduction are tightly associated. However, no detectable release of ferrous iron from the MECAM complex implies that, with these in vitro preparations, metal reduction depends upon, and is subsequent to, the esterase activity of Fes. These observations are discussed in relation to studies which show that such enterobactin analogs can supply growth-promoting iron concentrations to E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1562987298,"The ars operon of the conjugative R-factor R773 encodes an oxyanion pump that catalyzes extrusion of arsenicals from cells of Escherichia coli. The oxyanion translocation ATPase is composed of two polypeptides, the catalytic ArsA protein and the intrinsic membrane protein, ArsB. The topology of regions of the ArsB protein in the inner membrane was determined using a variety of gene fusions. Random gene fusions with lacZ and phoA were generated using transposon mutagenesis. A series of gene fusions with blaM were constructed in vitro using a beta-lactamase fusion vector. To localize individual segments of the ArsB protein, a ternary fusion method was developed, where portions of the arsB gene were inserted in-frame between the coding regions for two heterologous proteins, in this case a portion of a newly identified arsD gene and the blaM sequence encoding the mature beta-lactamase. The location of a periplasmic loop was determined from V8 protease digestion of an ArsA-ArsB chimera. From analysis of data from 26 fusions, a topological model of the ArsB protein with 12 membrane-spanning regions is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1483862752,"An interesting property of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase II is the stimulation in DNA synthesis mediated by the DNA polymerase III accessory proteins beta,gamma complex. In this paper we have studied the basis for the stimulation in pol II activity and have concluded that these accessory proteins stimulate pol II activity by increasing the processivity of the enzyme between 150- and 600-fold. As is the case with pol III, processive synthesis by pol II requires both beta,gamma complex and SSB protein. Whereas the intrinsic velocity of synthesis by pol II is 20-30 nucleotides per s with or without the accessory proteins, the processivity of pol II is increased from approximately five nucleotides to greater than 1600 nucleotides incorporated per template binding event. The effect of the accessory proteins on the rate of replication is far greater on pol III than on pol II; pol III holoenzyme is able to complete replication of circular single-stranded M13 DNA in less than 20 s, whereas pol II in the presence of the gamma complex and beta requires approximately 5 min. We have investigated the effect of beta,gamma complex proteins on bypass of a site-specific abasic lesion by E. coli DNA polymerases I, II, and III. All three polymerases are extremely inefficient at bypass of the abasic lesion. We find limited bypass by pol I with no change upon addition of accessory proteins. pol II also shows limited bypass of the abasic site, dependent on the presence of beta,gamma complex and SSB. pol III shows no significant bypass of the abasic site with or without beta,gamma complex."
https://openalex.org/W1892163163,"The filling state of the intracellular Ca2+ stores of rat thymocytes regulates plasma membrane permeability to Mn2+, used here as a Ca2+ surrogate for plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. Emptying of the Ca2+ stores accelerated Mn2+ entry about 10-fold, and refilling with Ca2+ restored low Mn2+ permeability. The acceleration of Mn2+ entry observed in cells with empty intracellular Ca2+ stores was prevented by cytochrome P450 inhibitors. Imidazole antimycotics, especially econazole and miconazole, were the most potent inhibitors (IC50 approximately equal to 10(-6) M). The inhibitor sensitivity profile was similar to IA-type cytochrome P450. Calmodulin antagonists increased the plasma membrane permeability to Mn2+ in cells with filled Ca2+ stores, and this effect was also blocked by imidazole antimycotics. On this basis, we propose a model in which activation of a cytochrome P450, situated at the Ca2+ stores, opens a plasma membrane Ca2+ pathway. This activity would be inhibited by Ca2+ inside the stores by a calmodulin-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1590238088,"Abstract The high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) is a tetrameric hetero-oligomer composed of an alpha chain, a beta chain, and two disulfide-linked gamma chains. The beta chain contains four transmembrane (TM) segments and long cytoplasmic domains that are thought to play an important role in intracellular signaling. We now report the structural characterization and the sequence of the complete human beta gene and cDNA. The gene spans approximately 10 kilobases and contains seven exons. There is a single transcription initiation site preceded by a TATA box. The first exon codes for the 5'-untranslated region and a portion of the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail. TM-1 is encoded in exons 2 and 3, TM-2 in exons 3 and 4, TM-3 in exon 5, and TM-4 in exon 6. The seventh and final exon encodes the end of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail and the 3'-untranslated sequence. The human beta gene appears to be a single copy gene. Two corresponding transcripts, detected as a doublet around 3.9 kilobases, are present in cells of mast cell and basophil lineage from different individuals, but not in the other hematopoietic cells tested here. The human beta protein is homologous to rodent beta. The consensus amino acid sequences of human, mouse, and rat beta show 69% identical residues. Analysis of the surface expression of transfected receptors indicates that human alpha gamma and alpha beta gamma complexes are expressed with comparable efficiency. Human beta interacts with human alpha more efficiently than does rat beta, and both rat and mouse beta interact with their corresponding alpha more efficiently than does human beta, demonstrating a species specificity of the alpha/beta interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2045651197,"The bacteriophage λ gene Q transcription antiterminator modifies RNA polymerase during an extended pause in elongation at nt +16 and +17 of the phage late gene promoter transcript. We show here that Q binds a specific DNA site between the −10 and −35 elements of the promoter as it interacts with the enzyme. We show that the pause must reflect a specialized elongation structure that is receptive to modification by Q, because Q does not bind to RNA polymerase stopped artificially after transcribing 16 nt of mutant DNA that does not encode the natural pause. Footprinting shows that RNA polymerase in the paused complex makes distinctive interactions with DNA in the region where Q binds; binding of Q, in turn, changes the footprint both at the Q-binding site and in the transcription bubble. Binding of Q to the paused transcription complex is stabilized by the transcription factor NusA, as expected from the dependence of λ Q-mediated anti-termination on NusA."
https://openalex.org/W2065861374,The opening of duplex DNA in the elongation phase of transcription by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in vivo was detected at a regulatory site where a prolonged pause in transcription occurs. Single-stranded DNA in the transcription bubble was identified by its reactivity with potassium permanganate (KMnO4). The elongation structure in vivo was similar to that of transcription complexes made in vitro with some differences. The observed reactivity to KMnO4 of the DNA template strand was consistent with the existence of an RNA-DNA hybrid of about 12 nucleotides.

https://openalex.org/W1572876773,"The phosphate carrier (PiC) of mammalian mitochondria is synthesized with a cleavable presequence, in contrast to other members of the mitochondrial family of inner membrane carrier proteins. The precursor of PiC is efficiently imported, proteolytically processed, and correctly assembled in isolated mitochondria. Here we report that a presequence-deficient PiC was imported with an efficiency of about 50% as compared with the authentic precursor of PiC. This mature-sized PiC was correctly assembled, demonstrating that the presequence is not essential for the assembly pathway. We found the following functions for the PiC presequence. (i) The presequence by itself was able to target a passenger protein to mitochondria with a low efficiency, suggesting that the mammalian PiC contains multiple targeting signals, the more efficient one(s) present in the mature protein part. (ii) Deletion of the presequence allowed a more efficient heterologous import of mammalian PiC into mitochondria from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa, indicating an important role of the presequence in determining the specificity of PiC import. (iii) Import of the presequence-deficient PiC required a higher membrane potential across the inner membrane than that of the presequence-carrying form. Therefore, the presequence also enhances the translocation of PiC into the inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2004382290,"At any template position, the decision to extend the transcript by one residue or to release the nascent RNA represents a kinetic competition between elongation and termination pathways. This competition is discussed in terms of alternative Eyring transition state barriers; changes in termination efficiency correspond to small changes in the relative heights of these barriers. Elongation complexes are stable at nonterminator positions; a model is presented to explain the destabilization of these complexes at intrinsic termination sites. Functionally analogous effects can operate at rho-dependent terminators. Mechanisms for modulation of termination efficiency by regulatory proteins are described."

https://openalex.org/W1545892847,"Abstract The mechanism of kinesin ATPase has been investigated by transient state kinetic analysis. The results satisfy the scheme [formula: see text] where T, D, and P(i) refer to nucleotide tri- and diphosphate and inorganic phosphate, respectively. The nucleotide-binding steps were measured by the fluorescence enhancement of mant (2'-(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-ATP and mant-ADP. The initial rapid equilibrium binding steps (1) and (6) are followed by isomerizations (k2 = 170 +/- 30 s-1 at 20 degrees C, k-5 greater than 100 s-1). The increase in fluorescence is 20-25% larger for K.T** than K.D*. The rate constant of the hydrolysis step k3 is 6-7 s-1. The fluorescence decreases after formation of K.T** at a rate of 7-10 s-1. This change could occur in step 3 or in step 4 if k4 much greater than k3. The value of k4 is larger than 0.1 s-1. The steady state rate is 0.003 s-1 which agrees with the rate of ADP dissociation (k5). Step 5 is rate limiting in the scheme in agreement with the conclusion of Hackney (Hackney, D. D. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 6314-6318) that ADP dissociation is the rate-limiting step."

https://openalex.org/W1986506723,"A Dictyostelium mutant (7-11) that expresses less than 0.5% of wild-type levels of the myosin essential light chain (EMLC) has been created by overexpression of antisense RNA. Cells from 7-11 contain wild-type levels of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) and regulatory light chain (RMLC). Myosin isolated from 7-11 cells consists of the MHC with the RMLC associated in reduced stoichiometry, and binds to purified actin in an ATP-sensitive fashion. Purified 7-11 myosin displays calcium-activated ATPase activity with a Vmax about 15%-25% of that of wild type, and a Km for ATP of 27 +/- 5 microM versus 83 +/- 30 microM for wild type. At actin concentrations as high as 17 microM, 7-11 myosin displays greatly reduced actin-activated ATPase activity. Phenotypically, 7-11 cells resemble MHC mutants, growing poorly in suspension and becoming large and multinucleate. When starved for multicellular development, 7-11 cells take several hours longer than wild-type cells to aggregate. Although multicellular aggregates eventually form, they fail to develop further. The cells are also unable to cap receptors in response to Con A treatment. Since cells expressing the EMLC are phenotypically similar to MHC null mutants, the EMLC appears necessary for myosin function, at least in part because it is required for normal actin-activated ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1572987328,"A recently identified novel mammalian cyclin (CYL1), induced by growth factors and apparently functional during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, is of potential significance, given that cell division is primarily controlled in G1. We have measured CYL1 gene expression in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM), a normal cell type dependent upon colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) for survival and proliferation. The induction of CYL1 mRNA levels correlated strongly with stimulation of DNA synthesis, since elevated CYL1 mRNA levels occurred in response to the mitogenic stimuli, CSF-1, and granulocyte/macrophage CSF, but not to nonmitogenic macrophage-activating agents. BMM are subject to cell cycle arrest by numerous agents, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and agents that increase cAMP. These antiproliferative agents suppressed CSF-1-stimulated CYL1 gene expression, even when added late in G1. This pattern of CYL1 gene expression was remarkably consistent with the ability of these agents to inhibit progression into S phase. The mechanisms of negative growth regulation are largely unknown, and given the likely importance of G1 cyclins in the control of cell division, we propose that antiproliferative agents may exert their effects by suppressing G1 cyclin gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1548879083,"A 68-kDa glycoprotein bearing the biological activity of the plasma membrane serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) transporter has been purified from human blood platelets, a classical cell model for the study of 5-HT uptake. After treatment of the whole platelet population or its plasma membrane fraction by sulfhydryl-dependent bacterial protein toxins or by digitonin, purification was reproducibly obtained by a one-step affinity chromatography using two different columns with 5-HT or 6-fluorotryptamine as ligands and elution by 5-HT or Na(+)-free buffer. The purified fraction migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 68 kDa and exhibited an apparent isoelectric point of 5.6-6.2. Two sialic acid residues were detected in the purified material. The purified glycoprotein bound the 5-HT uptake blocker [3H]paroxetine with a Kd (0.25 nM) similar to the one observed for intact human platelets. It also bound [3H] 5-HT but neither [3H]hydroxytetrabenazine nor [3H] ouabain, the respective markers of the granular monoamine transporter and of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase associated to the plasma membrane 5-HT transporter. 5-HT derivatives and 5-HT uptake inhibitors exhibited similar Ki values for 5-HT uptake and paroxetine binding in intact human platelets and in the purified glycoprotein. Under laser UV irradiation, 40% of this purified glycoprotein could be labeled by either [3H]paroxetine or [3H]cyanoimipramine. No labeling was detected with either [3H] gamma-aminobutyric acid or [3H]GBR 12783, the respective markers of gamma-aminobutyric acid and dopamine carriers. The purified 68-kDa protein is therefore likely to correspond at least to the binding domain of the 5-HT transporter located at the human platelet plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1563992449,"Laminin, a basement membrane glycoprotein, has diverse biological activities including cell adhesion, growth, and differentiation. However, little is known concerning the signal transduction and active site involved in cell growth. In this study, we have shown that laminin and a 19-mer peptide (PA22-2) from the carboxyl-terminal end of the long arm of the laminin A chain, which was previously shown to promote cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth, stimulate thymidine incorporation and cell growth of PC12 cells. Laminin and PA22-2 (PA) were also found to induce a rapid and transient mRNA expression of c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes in PC12 cells. Further, both laminin and PA stimulated the DNA binding activity of c-Fos and c-Jun protein complex to the AP-1 site. We have also found that there is a correlation between cell growth, c-fos expression, and the ability of cell attachment to laminin or to PA in different cell types. These results suggest that the PA sequence is a potent site in laminin for both signal transduction and cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1532741974,"Antigen triggering of the T-cell receptor results in an accumulation of activated GTP-bound p21ras protein. To assess the role of ras protein in T-cell activation we have cotransfected the murine thymoma line EL4 with a construct capable of expressing a constitutively active, oncogenic form of Ha-ras and a reporter construct containing the human interleukin-2 promoter fused upstream of the bacterial gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. We show that the ras oncoprotein contributes to interleukin-2 promoter activation. Its pattern of synergism with a calcium ionophore or the lymphokine interleukin-1 indicates that it replaces a signal mediated by protein kinase C. Interleukin-2 promoter activity in the presence of ras oncoprotein was inhibited by H7, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, but not by HA1004, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinase, suggesting that protein kinase C mediates the ras effect. In addition, we show that in these cells, expression of activated ras results in activation of a synthetic promoter containing several copies of an NF kappa B binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1534501747,"Vascular smooth muscle cells proliferate and transform to foam cells in the process of atherosclerosis. In the present study, we demonstrated that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB induced expression of proto-oncogene c-fms in vascular smooth muscle cells, which normally do not express c-fms, isolated from either human umbilical artery or rabbit aorta. No effect of the protein kinase C activator, phorbol ester, was demonstrated on mRNA expression of c-fms. In contrast, the scavenger receptor activity was induced by both PDGF-BB and phorbol ester. These results indicate that two characteristic genes of monocyte-macrophages were induced by PDGF-BB via the different pathways, and suggest that PDGF-BB plays an important role in initiating phenotypic conversion of smooth muscle cells to macrophage-like cells."

We have found that both in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation of caldesmon causes similar changes in the properties, including reduction in actin, calmodulin, and myosin binding of caldesmon, and a decrease in the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase by caldesmon. Rat non-muscle caldesmon is phosphorylated in vitro up to a ratio of 7 mol/mol of protein. Actin-binding constants of both a high affinity (K a = 1.2 x 10(7) M-1) and a low affinity (K a = 1 x 10(6) M-1) site of unphosphorylated caldesmon are reduced to less than 10(5) M-1 with 5 mol of phosphate incorporation per mol of protein. Actin-bound caldesmon can be phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase, which results in the dissociation of caldesmon from F-actin. Caldesmon has a second myosin-binding site in the C terminus, in addition to the N terminus myosin-binding domain previously reported, because the bacterially expressed C terminus of caldesmon shows binding to myosin. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal fragments decreases their myosin-binding affinity as observed with intact caldesmon. These results suggest that caldesmon loses most of its in vitro functions during mitosis as a result of phosphorylation, which may be required for the reorganization of microfilaments during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1483724566,"There exists a Mg(2+)-ATPase in transverse tubules which has properties that are very different from other ATPases located in skeletal muscle cells. Several groups have suggested that a 100-kDa glycoprotein is the molecular entity responsible for this Mg(2+)-ATPase activity. In this study we have extended the methods utilized in the purification of this integral membrane glycoprotein. Although the apparent pI (isoelectric point) of this protein is pH 5, most of the net charge is due to the presence of sialic acid on the associated glycan chains. After these residues are removed, the behavior of this protein on an anion exchange column changes dramatically, allowing it to be further purified. Using a combination of the earlier procedures (Kirley, T.L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12682-12689 and Kirley, T. L. (1991) Biochem. J. 278, 375-400.) and the one reported here, purification to specific activities of approximately 400,000 mumol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg of protein/h were obtained and all traces of the 100-kDa protein were removed. The digitonin-solubilized Mg(2+)-ATPase appears to be a dimer of two identical 67-kDa subunits as assessed by high performance size exclusion chromatography. A single diffuse protein band is observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at approximately 67 kDa, which reduced to a single tight protein band at 52 kDa after deglycosylation with the following unique N-terminal amino acid sequence: Ala-Lys-Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Leu-Leu-Leu-Pro- Pro-Leu-Val-X-Ala-Ala-Leu-Gly-Leu-Ala-X-Phe. Therefore, the Mg(2+)-ATPase appears to be an enzyme of very high specific activity, present in small quantities in transverse tubule membranes and unrelated to the known classes of ATPases present in skeletal muscle. The data reported here on the orientation of the transverse-tubule membrane preparations are consistent with the very recent report (Saborido, A., Moro, G., and Megias A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 23490-23498) that the Mg(2+)-ATPase is an ecto-enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1522466247,"A new approach to determining the active site orientation of microsomal glycosyltransferases is presented which utilizes the photoaffinity analogs [32P]5-Azido-UDP-glucose ([32P]5N3UDP-Glc) and [32P]5-Azido-UDP-glucuronic acid ([32P]5N3UDP-GlcA). It was previously shown that both photoprobes could be used to photolabel UDP-glucose:dolichol phosphate glucosyltransferase (Glc-P-Dol synthase), as well as the family of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in rat liver microsomes. The effects of detergents, proteases, and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) on the photolabeling of these enzymes were examined in intact rat liver microsomes. Photolabeling of Glc-P-Dol synthase by either photoprobe was the same in intact or disrupted vesicles, was susceptible to trypsin digestion, and was inhibited by the nonpenetrating inhibitor DIDS. Photolabeling of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases by [32P]5N3UDP-GlcA was stimulated 1.3-fold in disrupted vesicles as compared to intact vesicles, whereas photolabeling of these enzymes by [32P]5N3UDP-Glc showed a 14-fold increase when vesicles were disrupted. Photolabeled UDP-glucuronosyltransferases were only susceptible to trypsin digestion in disrupted vesicles, and this was further verified by Western blot analyses. The results indicate a cytoplasmic orientation for access of UDP-sugars to Glc-P-Dol synthase and a lumenal orientation of most UDP-glucuronosyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1577836769,"Abstract The structure of a major ether polar lipid of the methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina barkeri was identified as glucosaminyl archaetidylinositol. This lipid had archaeol (2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol) as a core lipid portion, and the polar head group consisted of 1 mol each of phosphate, myo-inositol and D-GlcN. The polar head group was identified by means of chemical degradations, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment, permethylation analysis, and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry as glucosaminylinositol phosphate, which was linked to the glycerol backbone via a phosphodiester bond. The stereochemical configuration of the phospho-myo-inositol residue of glucosaminyl archaetidylinositol was determined to be 1-D-myo-inositol 1-phosphate by measuring optical rotation of phospho-myo-inositol prepared by nitrous acid deamination and alkaline hydrolysis from the lipid. 1H NMR of the intact lipid showed that GlcN was linked to C-6 position of myo-inositol as an alpha-anomer. It is, finally, concluded that the complete structure of this lipid is 2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-1-phospho- 1'[6'-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)]-1'-D-myo-inositol. This lipid has a hybrid nature of an archaeal feature in alkyl glycerol diether core portion and an eucaryal feature in the polar head group identical to the conserved core structure (GlcNp(alpha 1-6)-myo-inositol 1-phosphate) of glycosylated phosphatidylinositol which serves as a membrane protein anchor in eucaryal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1824632392,"Four major glycolipids were extracted from Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites which were metabolically labeled with tritiated glucosamine, mannose, palmitic and myristic acid, ethanolamine, and inositol. Judging from their sensitivity to a set of enzymatic and chemical tests, these glycolipids share the following properties with the glycolipid moiety of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (GPI anchor) of the major surface protein, P30, of T. gondii: 1) a nonacetylated glucosamine-inositol phosphate linkage; 2) sensitivity toward phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and nitrous acid; 3) identity of HF-dephosphorylated GPI glycan backbone between three glycolipids and the HF-dephosphorylated core glycan of the GPI anchor of the major surface protein P30; 4) the presence of a linear core glycan structure blocked by an ethanolamine phosphate residue(s). Taken together with the nature of radiolabeled precursors incorporated into these glycolipids, the data indicate that these GPIs are involved in the biosynthesis of the GPI-membrane anchors of T. gondii."
https://openalex.org/W1591242790,"The primary sequence of maize 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase was deduced from cDNAs isolated from maize cDNA libraries by screening with specific antibodies to the cofactor-independent enzyme and from a maize genomic clone. The genomic clone provided the 5'-nucleotide sequence encoding the N-terminal amino acids which could not be obtained from the cDNA. Confirmation that the nucleotide sequence was for the cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase was obtained by sequencing the peptides generated from cyanogen bromide cleavage of the purified protein. This is the first report of the amino acid sequence of a 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase, which consists of 559 amino acids and is twice the molecular size of the mammalian cofactor-dependent enzyme subunit. Analysis of the cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase amino acid sequence revealed no identity with the cofactor-dependent mutase types. Northern blot analysis confirmed this difference since the maize cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase cDNA did not hybridize with mRNA of the cofactor-dependent mutase. The lack of amino acid identity between cofactor-dependent and -independent enzymes is consistent with their different catalytic mechanisms and suggests that both enzymes are unrelated evolutionarily and arose from two independent ancestral genes. However, a constellation of residues which are involved in metal ion binding in various alkaline phosphatases is conserved in the maize cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase, which suggests that the enzyme is a member of the alkaline phosphatase family of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1480671132,"The regulation of the membrane-bound H(+)-ATPase from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus was investigated. In the presence of uncouplers the rate of ATP hydrolysis was about 40 mM ATP/M bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl)/s. Without uncouplers this rate increased and if, additionally, the chromatophores were illuminated, it was almost doubled. If uncouplers were added shortly after illumination, the rate increased to 300-350 mM ATP/M Bchl/s. Obviously, energization of the membrane leads to the formation of a metastable, active state of the H(+)-ATPase. The maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis can be measured only when first all H(+)-ATPases are activated by delta mu H+ and when the delta mu H+ is abolished in order to release its back pressure on the hydrolysis rate. The half-life time of the metastable state in the absence of delta mu H+ is about 30 s. It is increased by 3 mM Pi to about 80 s and it is decreased by 1 mM ADP to about 15 s. Quantitatively, the fraction of active H(+)-ATPases shows a sigmoidal dependence on pHin (at constant pHout) and the magnitude of delta psi determines the maximal fraction of enzymes which can be activated: delta pH and delta psi are not equivalent for the activation process."
https://openalex.org/W1655792011,"A mutant single chain urokinase plasminogen activator (scu-PA) was constructed by the addition of an apical membrane targeting signal from decay accelerating factor to the scu-PA carboxyl terminus. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (EC) were transduced with the mutant scu-PA. Metabolic labeling, immunoprecipitation, and gel electrophoresis revealed that the mutant scu-PA was present in a single-chain form at the EC surface. Immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after treatment of EC with phosphotidylinositol-specific phospholipase C confirmed that scu-PA was attached to the EC surface by a glycosyl-phosphotidylinositol anchor. Approximately 10(6) anchored scu-PA molecules/cell were present; however, anchoring was not 100% efficient, with scu-PA released into the medium as well. Selective biotinylation of the apical and basolateral surfaces revealed that anchored scu-PA was polarized to the apical surface. Apically anchored scu-PA could be converted by plasmin to two-chain urokinase, with a normal specific activity (140,000 IU/mg) as measured with the chromogenic substrate S-2444. Expression of anchored scu-PA resulted in an increase in EC surface plasminogen activator activity, as compared with the activity of either untransduced EC or EC transduced with a wild type scu-PA. These experiments demonstrate: 1) apical membrane targeting can be accomplished in EC; 2) scu-PA can be anchored to the EC surface with preservation of enzymatic activity; 3) EC surface plasminogen activator activity is significantly increased by the presence of anchored scu-PA. Cell surface targeted plasminogen activators may eventually be useful in the prevention and treatment of intravascular thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W2151662824,"The periplasmic glucans of Gram-negative bacteria, including the membrane-derived oligosaccharides (MDO) of Escherichia coli and the cyclic glucans of the Rhizobiaceae, have important but poorly understood functions in osmotic adaptation and, in the case of the Rhizobiaceae, in the complex cell-signaling of these bacteria with specific plant hosts. Experiments on the mechanisms of osmotic regulation of the biosynthesis of MDO in E. coli reported here support a model in which osmotic regulation occurs principally at the level of modulation of enzyme activity rather than at the level of gene expression. 1) Activity of the membrane-bound glucosyltransferase thought to catalyze the first and rate-making step in the biosynthesis of MDO is not altered by the osmolarity of the medium in which cells are grown. 2) Upon dilution of cells growing at high osmolarity into a medium of low osmolarity, the increased synthesis of MDO begins at maximum rate without detectable lag. 3) The activity of the membrane glucosyltransferase in vitro is strongly inhibited by high levels of salts, consistent with the view that synthesis in vivo is regulated chiefly by this mechanism, rather than by regulation of the synthesis of biosynthetic enzymes. We also find that the biosynthesis of MDO is regulated not only osmotically but also by strong feedback inhibition in response to the levels of MDO in the periplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1502722796,"The conventional procedure for the purification of the high affinity K+ uptake ATPase (KdpABC) from Escherichia coli involves a tedious three-column protocol (final enzyme purity, approximately 90%; activity yield, 6.5% (Siebers, A., and Altendorf, K. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 178, 131-140)). We have now developed a highly effective one-column (Fractogel TSK AF-Red) protocol yielding an enzyme preparation of comparable purity with severalfold higher activity yield. A further increase in enzyme purity up to 98% was achieved by a two-column protocol involving elution over DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B prior to TSK AF-Red affinity chromatography. The reduction of preparation time minimized KdpB protein degradation and led to hitherto unequaled values of specific activity (up to 2000 mumols x g-1 x min-1) and enrichment factors (up to 30-fold). Our results confirm the usefulness of triazine dye matrices for the purification of transport ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W1944462698,"Glycerol can be oxidized by rat liver microsomes to formaldehyde in a reaction that requires the production of reactive oxygen intermediates. Studies with inhibitors, antibodies, and reconstituted systems with purified cytochrome P4502E1 were carried out to evaluate whether P450 was required for glycerol oxidation. A purified system containing phospholipid, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, P4502E1, and NADPH oxidized glycerol to formaldehyde. Formaldehyde production was dependent on NADPH, reductase, and P450, but not phospholipid. Formaldehyde production was inhibited by substrates and ligands for P4502E1, as well as by anti-pyrazole P4502E1 IgG. The oxidation of glycerol by the reconstituted system was sensitive to catalase, desferrioxamine, and EDTA but not to superoxide dismutase or mannitol, indicating a role for H2O2 plus non-heme iron, but not superoxide or hydroxyl radical in the overall glycerol oxidation pathway. The requirement for reactive oxygen intermediates for glycerol oxidation is in contrast to the oxidation of typical substrates for P450. In microsomes from pyrazole-treated, but not phenobarbital-treated rats, glycerol oxidation was inhibited by anti-pyrazole P450 IgG, anti-hamster ethanol-induced P450 IgG, and monoclonal antibody to ethanol-induced P450, although to a lesser extent than inhibition of dimethylnitrosamine oxidation. Anti-rabbit P4503a IgG did not inhibit glycerol oxidation at concentrations that inhibited oxidation of dimethylnitrosamine. Inhibition of glycerol oxidation by antibodies and by aminotriazole and miconazole was closely associated with inhibition of H2O2 production. These results indicate that P450 is required for glycerol oxidation to formaldehyde; however, glycerol is not a direct substrate for oxidation to formaldehyde by P450 but is a substrate for an oxidant derived from interaction of iron with H2O2 generated by cytochrome P450."
https://openalex.org/W1536720659,"Studies to establish the structure/function relationships of oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein (OSCP) of mitochondrial ATP synthase were carried out using genetic engineering and biochemical approaches. A full-length cDNA clone encoding OSCP was isolated from a bovine heart cDNA library, and the mature form of OSCP was expressed in Escherichia coli using plasmid expression vector pKP1500. Recombinant OSCP was found to accumulate in the cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, by virtue of which the recombinant protein could be purified to greater than 85% purity by simple low speed centrifugation of cell lysates. Recombinant OSCP was found to be indistinguishable from OSCP isolated from mitochondria with respect to (i) apparent molecular mass on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, (ii) immunological reactivity to anti-OSCP serum, (iii) biological activity in restoring oligomycin-sensitive ATPase and Pi-ATP exchange activities to OSCP-depleted ATP synthase complexes, and (iv) insensitivity of the biological activity to sulfhydryl-directed alkylating reagents. The amino-terminal sequence of the recombinant protein revealed that the initiating methionine was not removed by E. coli, although that apparently did not affect protein folding or its biological activity. Data on nested deletion mutations starting from the carboxyl terminus in OSCP demonstrated that, in each instance, the mutant form was expressed and the protein product was sequestered in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, similar to the wild-type form. However, none of the variants, including the one in which only the last 10 residues were deleted, was able to restore cold-stable oligomycin-sensitive ATPase or Pi-ATP exchange activity in OSCP-depleted complexes. Taken together, these data suggest that amino acid residues 181-190 (or some of the residues in this region) in the OSCP sequence may be important for OSCP-F1 interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1495126922,"Binding of the photoreactive ATP analog, 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP), to the isolated alpha and beta subunits of TF1 and to the alpha 3 beta 3 complex of the holoenzyme is described. About 1 mol of BzATP/mol of subunit was incorporated to isolated alpha and beta subunits. The incorporation of BzATP was prevented by ATP. Covalent binding of BzATP to the alpha subunit was in general somewhat lower than that observed with the beta subunit. No complex was formed upon mixing of either of the modified subunits with the complementary nontreated subunits. Covalent binding of 3 mol of BzATP/alpha 3 beta 3 complex completely inhibited ATPase activity and resulted in the dissociation of the complex. The labeled nucleotide analog was specifically incorporated into the beta subunit of the complex. The holoenzyme TF1, in contrast to the core complex, did not dissociate to the individual subunits upon covalent binding of BzATP. These results are discussed in relation to the location of the catalytic nucleotide binding site(s) and the conformation stability of the alpha 3 beta 3 core complex of TF1."
https://openalex.org/W1946577199,"Occupancy of the T cell antigen receptor triggers a complex set of events that culminate in cellular activation. It is clear that tyrosine kinases play important roles in this process. The zeta subunit of the T cell antigen receptor is a 16-kDa transmembrane structure that exists primarily as a disulfide-linked homodimer. On receptor activation, a subset of zeta molecules undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. To evaluate this process and the role of zeta phosphorylation in T cell activation, site-specific mutagenesis of the intracytoplasmic tyrosines of zeta has been carried out. Analysis of cells expressing these mutant zeta subunits demonstrated that multiple tyrosines underwent phosphorylation in response to receptor engagement, and that the four most carboxyl tyrosines were most crucial to this process. Despite abnormalities in phosphorylation induced by the mutations, lymphokine production in these transfectants was unaffected. Hence, although zeta is a prominent substrate for a receptor-activated tyrosine kinase, neither the mutation of individual tyrosines nor the alteration of the phosphorylation state of the molecule substantively affected the coupling of T cell receptor activation to lymphokine production. These findings raise questions regarding the role of zeta phosphorylation in T cell activation."
