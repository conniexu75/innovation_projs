https://openalex.org/W3048238828,"Case isolation and contact tracing can contribute to the control of COVID-19 outbreaks1,2. However, it remains unclear how real-world social networks could influence the effectiveness and efficiency of such approaches. To address this issue, we simulated control strategies for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a real-world social network generated from high-resolution GPS data that were gathered in the course of a citizen-science experiment3,4. We found that tracing the contacts of contacts reduced the size of simulated outbreaks more than tracing of only contacts, but this strategy also resulted in almost half of the local population being quarantined at a single point in time. Testing and releasing non-infectious individuals from quarantine led to increases in outbreak size, suggesting that contact tracing and quarantine might be most effective as a ‘local lockdown’ strategy when contact rates are high. Finally, we estimated that combining physical distancing with contact tracing could enable epidemic control while reducing the number of quarantined individuals. Our findings suggest that targeted tracing and quarantine strategies would be most efficient when combined with other control measures such as physical distancing. Combining fine-scale social contact data with epidemic modeling reveals interactions among contact tracing, quarantine, testing and physical distancing for controlling COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3048227500,"The burden of malaria is heavily concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where cases and deaths associated with COVID-19 are rising1. In response, countries are implementing societal measures aimed at curtailing transmission of SARS-CoV-22,3. Despite these measures, the COVID-19 epidemic could still result in millions of deaths as local health facilities become overwhelmed4. Advances in malaria control this century have been largely due to distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)5, with many SSA countries having planned campaigns for 2020. In the present study, we use COVID-19 and malaria transmission models to estimate the impact of disruption of malaria prevention activities and other core health services under four different COVID-19 epidemic scenarios. If activities are halted, the malaria burden in 2020 could be more than double that of 2019. In Nigeria alone, reducing case management for 6 months and delaying LLIN campaigns could result in 81,000 (44,000–119,000) additional deaths. Mitigating these negative impacts is achievable, and LLIN distributions in particular should be prioritized alongside access to antimalarial treatments to prevent substantial malaria epidemics. Transmission dynamics models of COVID-19 and malaria reveal how different scenarios of COVID-19 spread and varying levels of interruption to antimalarial programs could result in increased deaths in sub-Saharan Africa."

We studied the association between historical redlining and preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW), small-for-gestational age (SGA), and perinatal mortality over a ten-year period (2006-2015) in Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco, California.We used birth outcomes data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) Security Maps developed in the 1930s assigned neighborhoods one of four grades that pertained to perceived investment risk of borrowers from that neighborhood: green (grade A) were considered ""Best"", blue (grade B) ""Still Desirable"", yellow (grade C) ""Definitely Declining"", and red (grade D, hence the term ""redlining"") ""Hazardous"". Geocoded residential addresses at the time of birth were superimposed on HOLC Security Maps to assign each birth a HOLC grade. We adjusted for potential confounders present at the time of Security Map creation by assigning HOLC polygons areal-weighted 1940s Census measures. We then employed propensity score matching methods to estimate the association of historical HOLC grades on current birth outcomes. Because tracts graded A had almost no propensity of receiving grade C or D and because grade B tracts had low propensity of receiving grade D, we examined birth outcomes in the three following comparisons: B vs. A, C vs. B, and D vs. C.The prevalence of preterm birth, SGA and mortality tended to be higher in worse HOLC grades, while the prevalence of LBW varied across grades. Overall odds of mortality and preterm birth increased as HOLC grade worsened. Propensity score matching balanced 1940s census measures across contrasting groups. Logistic regression models revealed significantly elevated odds of preterm birth (odds ratio (OR): 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.05), and SGA (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00-1.05) in the C vs. B comparison and significantly reduced odds of preterm birth (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.91-0.95), LBW (OR: 0.94-95% CI: 0.92-0.97), and SGA (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92-0.96) in the D vs. C comparison. Results differed by metropolitan area and maternal race.Similar to prior studies on redlining, we found that worsening HOLC grade was associated with adverse birth outcomes, although this relationship was less clear after propensity score matching and stratifying by metropolitan area. Higher odds of preterm birth and SGA in grade C versus grade B neighborhoods may be caused by higher-stress environments, racial segregation, and lack of access to resources, while lower odds of preterm birth, SGA, and LBW in grade D versus grade C neighborhoods may due to population shifts in those neighborhoods related to gentrification."
https://openalex.org/W3048014252,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D)-an autoimmune disease that destroys the pancreatic islets, resulting in insulin deficiency-often begins early in life when islet autoantibody appearance signals high risk1. However, clinical diabetes can follow in weeks or only after decades, and is very difficult to predict. Ketoacidosis at onset remains common2,3 and is most severe in the very young4,5, in whom it can be life threatening and difficult to treat6-9. Autoantibody surveillance programs effectively prevent most ketoacidosis10-12 but require frequent evaluations whose expense limits public health adoption13. Prevention therapies applied before onset, when greater islet mass remains, have rarely been feasible14 because individuals at greatest risk of impending T1D are difficult to identify. To remedy this, we sought accurate, cost-effective estimation of future T1D risk by developing a combined risk score incorporating both fixed and variable factors (genetic, clinical and immunological) in 7,798 high-risk children followed closely from birth for 9.3 years. Compared with autoantibodies alone, the combined model dramatically improves T1D prediction at ≥2 years of age over horizons up to 8 years of age (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ≥ 0.9), doubles the estimated efficiency of population-based newborn screening to prevent ketoacidosis, and enables individualized risk estimates for better prevention trial selection."
https://openalex.org/W3048120681,"Pleiotropic roles are proposed for brain extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous studies have suggested a beneficial role for EVs in AD, where the endosomal system in vulnerable neurons is compromised, contributing to the removal of accumulated material from neurons. However, the involvement of EVs in propagating AD amyloidosis throughout the brain has been considered because the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), APP metabolites, and key APP cleaving enzymes were identified in association with EVs. Here, we undertook to determine whether the secretase machinery is actively processing APP in EVs isolated from the brains of wild-type and APP overexpressing Tg2576 mice. We found that full-length APP is cleaved in EVs incubated in the absence of cells. The resulting metabolites, both α- and β-APP carboxyl-terminal fragments and APP intracellular domain accumulate in EVs over time and amyloid-β dimerizes. Thus, EVs contribute to the removal from neurons and transport of APP-derived neurotoxic peptides. While this is potentially a venue for propagation of the pathology throughout the brain, it may contribute to efficient removal of neurotoxic peptides from the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3047960095,"Immunotherapy is a powerful treatment strategy being applied to cancer, autoimmune diseases, allergies, and transplantation. Although therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have demonstrated significant clinical efficacy, there is also the potential for severe adverse events, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS is characterized by the rapid production of inflammatory cytokines following delivery of therapy, with symptoms ranging from mild fever to life-threating pathology and multi-organ failure. Overall there is a paucity of models to reliably and accurately predict the induction of CRS by immune therapeutics. Here, we describe the development of a humanized mouse model based on the NOD-scid IL2rgnull (NSG) mouse to study CRS in vivo. PBMC-engrafted NSG, NSG-MHC-DKO, and NSG-SGM3 mice were used to study cytokine release in response to treatment with mAb immunotherapies. Our data show that therapeutic-stimulated cytokine release in these PBMC-based NSG models captures the variation in cytokine release between individual donors, is drug dependent, occurs in the absence of acute xeno-GVHD, highlighting the specificity of the assay, and shows a robust response following treatment with a TGN1412 analog, a CD28 superagonist. Overall our results demonstrate that PBMC-engrafted NSG models are rapid, sensitive, and reproducible platforms to screen novel therapeutics for CRS."
https://openalex.org/W3047907190,"Although we have shown that catecholamines suppress the activity of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) and atrophy-related genes expression through a cAMP-dependent manner in skeletal muscle from rodents, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that a single injection of norepinephrine (NE; 1 mg kg-1 ; s.c) attenuated the fasting-induced up-regulation of FoxO-target genes in tibialis anterior (TA) muscles by the stimulation of PKA/CREB and Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathways. In addition, muscle-specific activation of PKA by the overexpression of PKA catalytic subunit (PKAcat) suppressed FoxO reporter activity induced by (1) a wild-type; (2) a non-phosphorylatable; (3) a non-phosphorylatable and non-acetylatable forms of FoxO1 and FoxO3; (4) downregulation of FoxO protein content, and probably by (5) PGC-1α up-regulation. Consistently, the overexpression of the PKAcat inhibitor (PKI) up-regulated FoxO activity and the content of Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, as well as induced muscle fiber atrophy, the latter effect being prevented by the overexpression of a dominant negative (d. n.) form of FoxO (d.n.FoxO). The sustained overexpression of PKAcat induced fiber-type transition toward a smaller, slower, and more oxidative phenotype and improved muscle resistance to fatigue. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that endogenous PKA activity is required to restrain the basal activity of FoxO and physiologically important to maintain skeletal muscle mass."
https://openalex.org/W3048235020,"There is growing interest in ""osteosarcopenia"" as the coexistence of osteoporosis and sarcopenia exacerbates negative outcomes. However, limited information is available regarding the risk factors of osteosarcopenia development in patients with osteoporosis. Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed 276 consecutive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis who regularly visited Showa University Hospital. Patients were eligible for the study if they were ≥65 years of age and underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, blood sampling, and physical performance assessment. Patients were divided into the osteosarcopenia and osteoporosis alone groups according to the diagnostic criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. Of the 276 patients with osteoporosis, 54 patients (19.6%) had osteosarcopenia. Patients in the osteosarcopenia group had a greater risk of frailty than did those in the osteoporosis alone group (odds ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-4.80, P = 0.028). Low body mass index seemed to be the strongest factor related to the development of osteosarcopenia, and none of the patients in the osteosarcopenia group were obese (BMI ≥27.5 kg/m2). Multiple logistic analyses revealed that patients aged 65-74 years who had comorbidities such as kidney dysfunction and high levels of HbA1c were at risk of developing osteosarcopenia. Thus, we strongly recommend the assessment of the key components of the diagnosis of osteosarcopenia in an osteoporosis clinic for patients with low body mass index. Furthermore, appropriate assessments, including comorbidities, will help in identifying patients at greater risk of developing osteosarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W3047920680,"Necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common gastrointestinal disorder in premature neonates. This disease is characterized by massive epithelial necrosis, gut barrier dysfunction and improper mucosal defense development. Studies have shown that probiotic administration can decrease NEC incidence and mortality. The proposed mechanisms of probiotics for the prevention of NEC are: promotion of intestinal development; improved barrier function through decreased apoptosis and improved mucin production; decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8, and TNFα, and modulation of microbiota dysbiosis in preterm infants. However, reported sepsis in the immunocompromised preterm host has deterred routine prophylactic administration of probiotics in the neonatal intensive care unit. We hypothesize that maternal administration of probiotics to pregnant mouse dams can recapitulate the beneficial effects observed in neonates fed with probiotics directly. We exposed pregnant mice to the probiotics and monitored the changes in the developing intestines of the offspring. Pregnant mice were fed daily with the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis (LB) from embryonic day15 to 2-week-old postnatally. Intraperitoneal administration of IL-1β in the pups was used to model proinflammatory insults. Sera were collected at 2 weeks of age and evaluated for inflammatory cytokines by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay and gut permeability by Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran tracer assay. Ileal tissues were collected for the evaluation of apoptosis and proliferation of the intestinal epithelium; as well as mucin and tight junction integrity at mucosal surface by immunofluorescent staining. We find that maternal LB exposure facilitated intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, prevented loss of mucin and preserved the intestinal integrity and barrier function and decreased serum levels of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in the preweaned offsprings. in LB exposed pups. We demonstrate that maternal probiotic supplementation promotes gut maturation in developing offspring. This is potentially a safe alternative therapy to induce intestinal maturation and prevent prematurity-associated neonatal disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3047832171,"As type-I-allergies show an increasing prevalence in the general populace, orthodontic patients may also be affected by histamine release during treatment. Human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) are regulators of orthodontic tooth movement. However, the impact of histamine on PDLF in this regard is unknown. Therefore PDLF were incubated without or with an orthodontic compressive force of 2g/cm2 with and without additional histamine. To assess the role of histamine-1-receptor (H1R) H1R-antagonist cetirizine was used. Expression of histamine receptors and important mediators of orthodontic tooth movement were investigated. PDLF expressed histamine receptors H1R, H2R and H4R, but not H3R. Histamine increased the expression of H1R, H2R and H4R as well as of interleukin-6, cyclooxygenase-2, and prostaglandin-E2 secretion even without pressure application and induced receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) protein expression with unchanged osteoprotegerin secretion. These effects were not observed in presence of H1R antagonist cetirizine. By expressing histamine receptors, PDLF seem to be able to respond to fluctuating histamine levels in the periodontal tissue. Increased histamine concentration was associated with enhanced expression of proinflammatory mediators and RANKL, suggesting an inductive effect of histamine on PDLF-mediated osteoclastogenesis and orthodontic tooth movement. Since cetirizine inhibited these effects, they seem to be mainly mediated via histamine receptor H1R."

https://openalex.org/W3048199407,"Disrupted parental sleep, presenting as post-partum fatigue and perceived as problematic infant sleep, is related to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety among new mothers and fathers. Previous research indicates that UK parents would value an approach that facilitates meeting their infants’ needs while supporting their own sleep-related well-being throughout their infant’s first year. Six initial stakeholder meetings were held with 15 practitioners and 6 parents with an interest in supporting parent-infant sleep needs, to explore existing service provision and identify gaps. The Possums Sleep Program developed and delivered in Brisbane, Australia in a GP clinic setting, was chosen as an appropriate approach. Working collaboratively with a stakeholder group, we translated the Possums Sleep Program into an intervention that could be universally delivered in the UK via NHS antenatal and postnatal practitioners. Parent and practitioner views of the initial materials were obtained via feedback questionnaires and the tool was revised. The intervention was then field-tested by 164 practitioners who delivered it to at least 535 new parents and babies over 5 UK locations, to capture anonymous parent and practitioner views of the intervention concept, the materials, and their experiences with both. The intervention helps parents recalibrate their expectations of infant sleep development, encourages responsive parenting and experimentation to meet their infant’s needs, offers parents strategies for supporting the development of their babies’ biological sleep regulators and promote their own well-being, and teaches parents to manage negative thinking and anxiety that can impede sleep using the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. The ‘Sleep, Baby & You’ discussion tool, a 14 page illustrated booklet for parents, was field-tested and evaluated by practitioners and parents who offered enthusiastic feedback. Practitioners reported the ‘Sleep, Baby & You’ materials were easy for them to explain and for parents to understand, and were a good fit with the responsive parenting approaches they employed in other areas of their work. Parents who received the intervention postnatally understood the material and found the suggestions easy to follow. All parents who provided feedback had implemented one or more of the suggested changes, with the majority of changes (70%) being sustained for at least two weeks. Practitioners recommended development of digital and antenatal versions and offered feedback on circumstances that might challenge effective uptake of the intervention. ‘Sleep, Baby & You’ is a promising tool for promoting parental attitude and behaviour-change, that aims to adjust parental expectations and reduce negative thinking around infant sleep, promote responsive infant care in the face of infant-related sleep disruption and fatigue, and support parental well-being during the first year of parenthood. Initial field-testing provided insights useful for further development and subsequent testing via a randomised trial. Support exists for incorporating ‘Sleep, Baby & You’ into an anticipatory, universal intervention to support parents who may experience post-partum fatigue and infant sleep disruption."
https://openalex.org/W3047909517,"Chemotherapeutic enteritis is a major dose-limiting adverse reaction to chemotherapy, with few effective drugs in clinic. Intestinal ischemic injury plays prominent role in chemotherapeutic enteritis clinically. However, mechanism is not clear. In this article, irinotecan (CPT-11) was used to establish chemotherapeutic enteritis mice model. Western blotting, gelatin zymography, immunohistochemistry (IHC), Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) were used to detect the pathogenesis of ischemia-hypoxia injury. CPT-11 increased levels of tissue factor (TF) both in the blood and in intestines, and decreased the intestinal blood flow in mice. Interestingly, the elevation of TF in the blood displayed “double-peak,” which was consistent with the intestinal mucosal “double-strike” injury trend. Intestinal microthrombus and mixed thrombus formation were detectable in chemotherapeutic enteritis. Furthermore, ozone therapy relieved chemotherapeutic enteritis in mice. Ozone inhibited TF expression induced by CPT-11 via activating AMPK/SOCS3, and effectively ameliorated the intestinal mucosal injury in mice. Moreover, ozone autotransfusion therapy effectively attenuated chemotherapeutic enteritis and the blood hypercoagulability in patients. For the first time, we proposed that TF-induced thrombotic intestinal ischemic injury is a core trigger pathological mechanism of chemotherapeutic enteritis, and provided a new treatment strategy, ozone therapy, to suppress TF expression and treat chemotherapeutic enteritis."
https://openalex.org/W3047897346,"The protective effect of transthyretin (TTR) on cellular toxicity of β-amyloid (Aβ) has been previously reported. TTR is a tetrameric carrier of thyroxine in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, the pathogenic aggregation of which causes systemic amyloidosis. However, studies have documented a protective effect of TTR against cellular toxicity of pathogenic Aβ, a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. TTR binds Aβ, alters its aggregation, and inhibits its toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigate whether the amyloidogenic ability of TTR and its antiamyloid inhibitory effect are associated. Using protein aggregation and cytotoxicity assays, we found that the dissociation of the TTR tetramer, required for its amyloid pathogenesis, is also necessary to prevent cellular toxicity from Aβ oligomers. These findings suggest that the Aβ-binding site of TTR may be hidden in its tetrameric form. Aided by computational docking and peptide screening, we identified a TTR segment that is capable of altering Aβ aggregation and toxicity, mimicking TTR cellular protection. EM, immune detection analysis, and assessment of aggregation and cytotoxicity revealed that the TTR segment inhibits Aβ oligomer formation and also promotes the formation of nontoxic, nonamyloid amorphous aggregates, which are more sensitive to protease digestion. Finally, this segment also inhibits seeding of Aβ catalyzed by Aβ fibrils extracted from the brain of an Alzheimer's patient.

They also showed that silencing the endogenous TTR gene in AD transgenic mice accelerated Aβ42 deposition (5Choi S.H. Leight S.N. Lee V.M. Li T. Wong P.C. Johnson J.A. Saraiva M.J. Sisodia S.S.

What makes the pair of TTR and Aβ42 particularly interesting is the amyloid nature of the two elements. In health, TTR functions as a transporter of retinol and thyroxine in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and the eye and is secreted by the liver, choroid plexus, and retinal epithelium, respectively. However, dissociation of tetrameric TTR leads to amyloid fibril formation and systemic TTR amyloid deposition in patients of transthyretin amyloidosis (11Westermark P. Sletten K. Johansson B.

Whether the amyloidogenicity of TTR is linked to its interaction to Aβ42 is still under debate. Previous work showed that different aggregation propensities of TTR result in distinct interaction capabilities: fewer amyloidogenic variants had increased affinity for Aβ (7Costa R. Gonçalves A. Saraiva M.J. Cardoso I. Transthyretin binding to A-β peptide: impact on A-β fibrillogenesis and toxicity.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582 (18295603): 936-94210.1016/j.febslet.2008.02.034Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, this did not impact on the levels of inhibition of Aβ aggregation, and cytotoxicity protection was not assessed. Here we attempt to fill the experimental gap by studying the protective effect of TTR variants at different aggregated states over Aβ42 cellular toxicity. In addition, we show the identification and characterization of a segment of TTR that binds Aβ42 triggering the formation of nonamyloid amorphous aggregates that are more sensitive to protease digestion, therefore mimicking TTR inhibitory effect over Aβ42. We first evaluated the protection against Aβ42 cytotoxicity by nine TTR variants with distinct aggregation propensities in several aggregated states (Table 1). The amyloidogenic behavior of three representative TTR variants is shown in Fig. 1 (A and B). For this assay, recombinant transthyretin was incubated at 37 °C, pH 4.3; protein aggregation was followed by immunodot blot of the insoluble fractions collected by centrifugation at several time points (Fig. 1A); and EM was performed after 4 days of incubation (Fig. 1B). We found that M-TTR, a monomeric-engineered form of transthyretin that is soluble at physiological pH (14Jiang X. Smith C.S. Petrassi H.M. Hammarström P. White J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Kelly J.W. An engineered transthyretin monomer that is nonamyloidogenic, unless it is partially denatured.Biochemistry. 2001; 40 (11560492): 11442-1145210.1021/bi011194dCrossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), shows notable aggregation after 1 day of incubation at pH 4.3 (Fig. 1, A–C). NSTTR is an artificially mutated variant of TTR carrying the double mutation N99R/S100R that, although remaining tetrameric in solution (Fig. 1C), shows a slower aggregation pattern than M-TTR (Fig. 1, A and B). T119M is a very stable mutant that did not show any sign of aggregation in 4 days (Fig. 1, A–C). Consistently, T119M results in a significant delay of the onset of hereditary neuropathic TTR amyloidosis in patients who carry both ttr-V30M and ttr-T119M genes (15Coelho T. Carvalho M. Saraiva M.J. Alves I. Almeida M.R. Costa P.P. A strikingly benign evolution of FAP in an individual found to be a compound heterozygote for two TTR mutations: TTR MET 30 and TTR MET 119.J. Rheumatol. 1993; 20: 179Google Scholar). We then incubated Aβ42 with the samples obtained from Fig. 1A for 16 h and evaluated its cytotoxicity by following MTT reduction. Three observations were made.Table 1List of TTR variants evaluated in this studyTTR variantMutationOligomeric state in solutionM-TTRF87M/L110MMonomerNSTTRN99R/S100RTetramerT119MT119MTetramerWTNoneTetramerA108R/L110RA108R/L110RTetramer + dimer + monomerM13R/L17RM13R/L17RDimer + monomerS112IS112IDimerL55PL55PTetramerL55P/T119ML55P/T119MTetramer Open table in a new tab The first observation is that once aggregated, TTR does not prevent Aβ42 toxicity, for any of the variants (Fig. 1D). In addition, the variant NSTTR, which aggregates at a slow pace, resulted to be cytoprotective longer than M-TTR (Fig. 1D). The third observation is that T119M, which does not dissociate and aggregate, does not prevent toxicity either (Fig. 1D). We observed the same phenomena when the other six TTR variants were evaluated (Fig. S1). Although variants S112I, M13R/L17R, or A108R/L110R are mainly monomeric or dimeric in solution, the cytotoxic protection at day 0 is not greater than NSTTR or L55P that are mainly tetrameric in solution (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1B). This finding suggests that the capacity to protect from Aβ42 toxicity does not correlate with the initial oligomeric state of soluble variants (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1B) but rather with the dissociation state at the moment of the co-incubation with Aβ42 (Fig. 1, A and B, and Fig. S1C). A control experiment shows that the TTR variants used in this assay were not cytotoxic in the absence of Aβ42, with the exception of M-TTR, which resulted in a 20% reduction of cell viability (Fig. S1D). Overall, our results indicate that dissociation of TTR is required for the inhibition of Aβ cytotoxicity. In addition, the data suggest that a more stable dissociated TTR exerts more Aβ42 inhibition than a more amyloidogenic variant. These findings led us to wonder whether a segment of TTR that is only exposed when dissociated but not in the aggregate might be similarly capable of altering Aβ toxicity. Computational modeling of the interaction of a fibrillar segment of Aβ42 and the TTR monomer shows a tight packing of the thyroxine-binding pocket and the fibrillar structure (Fig. 2). Others have shown that the amyloidogenic segment KLVFFA is protected when TTR is bound to Aβ (16Li X. Zhang X. Ladiwala A.R. Du D. Yadav J.K. Tessier P.M. Wright P.E. Kelly J.W. Buxbaum J.N. Mechanisms of transthyretin inhibition of β-amyloid aggregation in vitro.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33 (24336709): 19423-1943310.1523/JNEUROSCI.2561-13.2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In previous studies, the Eisenberg laboratory determined the structures of three fibrillar polymorphs of KLVFFA by X-ray microcrystallography (17Colletier J.P. Laganowsky A. Landau M. Zhao M. Soriaga A.B. Goldschmidt L. Flot D. Cascio D. Sawaya M.R. Eisenberg D. Molecular basis for amyloid-β polymorphism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We used these three polymorphs, as well as the monomeric form of WT TTR (PDB code 4TLT) (18Saelices L. Johnson L.M. Liang W.Y. Sawaya M.R. Cascio D. Ruchala P. Whitelegge J. Jiang L. Riek R. Eisenberg D.S. Uncovering the mechanism of aggregation of human transthyretin.J. Biol.

For every fibrillar form, the segment TTR(105–117) was the longest interacting TTR segment. The segment TTR(105–117) is only exposed in the monomeric or dimeric form of TTR. We wondered whether this segment might mimic TTR protective effects when isolated. The peptide TTR(105–117) was found to be highly amyloidogenic. We first analyzed the amyloidogenicity of TTR sequence by ZipperDB, which measures the propensity of every six-residue segment to form amyloid fibrils (19Goldschmidt L. Teng P.K. Riek R. Eisenberg D. Identifying the amylome, proteins capable of forming amyloid-like fibrils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

TTR predictions show that the region that contains this segment is highly prone to form amyloid structures. In fact, we found the segment TTR(105–117) and the shorter peptide TTR(106–117) to be amyloidogenic in solution (Fig. S2B), which may explain the lack of inhibitory effect in previous studies (21Cho P.Y. Joshi G. Johnson J.A. Murphy R.M. Transthyretin-derived peptides as β-amyloid inhibitors.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2014; 5 (24689444): 542-55110.1021/cn500014uCrossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast to the amorphous aggregates generated by recombinant full-length TTR, these peptides form amyloid-like fibrils (Fig. S2B). We then explored several sequence modifications to increase solubility, by eliminating the first tyrosine or adding a charged tag to the N-terminal end. The sequences and names of all the analyzed peptides are listed in Table 2. We found that TTR(105–117) amyloidogenicity was fully hindered by the addition of a polyarginine tag (Fig. S2B).Table 2List of peptides evaluated in this studyPeptide nameSequenceControls K5KKKKK R5RRRRR S12TIAALLSPYSYS S13YTIAALLSPYSYSOptimizations K14YTIAALLSPYSYSK K16YTIAALLSPYSYSKKK K18YTIAALLSPYSYSKKKKK R14YTIAALLSPYSYSR R16YTIAALLSPYSYSRRR K17TIAALLSPYSYSKKKKK R17TIAALLSPYSYSRRRRR TTR-SYTIAALLSPYSYSRRRRR Open table in a new tab The soluble tagged derivatives of the segment TTR(105–117) inhibited Aβ42 fibril formation (Fig. 3 and Figs. S3 and S4). We first evaluated the inhibitory effect of TTR-derived peptides over Aβ42 fibril formation in thioflavin T (ThT) assays (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3). Of all the peptides that we analyzed, the best Aβ42 inhibitory effect was obtained with TTR-S (sequence YTIAALLSPYSYSRRRRR), which contains a four-arginine tag followed by TTR(105–117) (Fig. S3). After an incubation of 2 days, we analyzed the samples by EM and found that the addition of TTR-S promoted the formation of amorphous aggregates (Fig. 3B) that were not birefringent when stained with Congo red (Fig. 3C). Remarkably, we found that TTR-S also promoted the formation of amorphous species when incubated with preformed Aβ42 fibrils (Fig. 3B). These aggregates were also found to be thioflavin T–negative (Fig. 3A), and nonbirefringent when stained with Congo red (Fig. 3C). The structural characterization of Aβ42 amorphous aggregates by CD showed that the addition of TTR-S to preformed fibrils resulted in a significant structural shift from β to helical secondary motifs (Fig. 3D). Additionally, we found that this structural modification results in cytotoxicity protection (Fig. 4). HeLa, PC12, and SH-5YSY cells were subjected to Aβ42 in the absence and presence of TTR-S at different molar ratios, and cell metabolic activity was followed by MTT reduction (Fig. 4, A–D). We found that the addition of TTR-S results in a significant reduction of Aβ42 cellular toxicity. This protective effect may be explained by the inhibition of the formation of A11-positive oligomers as a result of the incubation with TTR-S (Fig. 4D). It is worth noting that the larger aggregates did not resolve in the SDS-PAGE gel.Figure 4TTR-S inhibition of Aβ42 cytotoxicity. A–C, cell viability assay followed by MTT reduction in which HeLa (A), PC12 (B), and SH-5YSY (C) cells were treated with 10 μm Aβ42 in the absence and the presence of increasing concentrations of peptides.

Two gels were run to analyze Aβ42 before and after incubation and are shown in separate insets. The same samples were analyzed by dot blot with the oligomer specific A11 antibody (bottom panel). These results suggest that the inhibition of Aβ42 cytotoxicity by TTR-S results from the elimination of toxic oligomeric species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we found that the binding of TTR-S to soluble and fibrillar Aβ42 alters their protease resistance. Others have shown that TTR increases Aβ42 clearance in vivo (1Schwarzman A.L. Gregori L. Vitek M.P. Lyubski S. Strittmatter W.J. Enghilde J.J. Bhasin R. Silverman J. Weisgraber K.H. Coyle P.K. Transthyretin sequesters amyloid β protein and prevents amyloid formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91 (8078889): 8368-837210.1073/pnas.91.18.8368Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the large assemblies that form upon binding to TTR might be more sensitive to proteolytic activity than amyloid fibrils, thereby facilitating clearance. This hypothesis would also explain the protective effect found in vivo (6Buxbaum J.N. Ye Z. Reixach N. Friske L. Levy C. Das P. Golde T. Masliah E. Roberts A.R. Bartfai T. Transthyretin protects Alzheimer's mice from the behavioral and biochemical effects of Aβ toxicity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105 (18272491): 2681-268610.1073/pnas.0712197105Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We explored this hypothesis by analyzing proteolytic sensitivity of TTR-S–derived amorphous aggregates (Fig. 5). We incubated soluble and fibrillar Aβ42 with TTR-S overnight and collected the insoluble fractions by centrifugation. The immunodot blot of insoluble fractions showed that amorphous aggregates that result from the incubation of TTR-S with both soluble and fibrillar Aβ42 were easily digested by proteinase K after 1 h (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, Aβ42 fibrils showed a significantly higher resistance to proteinase K digestion. We included soluble Aβ42 in the assay as a control of proteolytic activity. Finally, we evaluated TTR-S ability to hinder amyloid seeding caused by fibrils extracted from the brain of an AD patient (Fig. 5C). The extraction of Aβ fibrils was performed by several cycles of homogenization and ultracentrifugation as described by Tycko (22Tycko R. Physical and structural basis for polymorphism in amyloid fibrils.Protein Sci. 2014; 23 (25179159): 1528-153910.1002/pro.2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Amyloid seeding was measured by thioflavin T fluorescence. As expected, we found that the addition of sonicated patient-derived fibrils to soluble Aβ42 resulted in the acceleration of fibril formation. In contrast, incubation with TTR-S resulted in inhibition of Aβ42 fibril formation even in the presence of patient-derived Aβ seeds. Our results indicate that the dissociation of the TTR tetramer is required to prevent cytotoxicity from Aβ oligomers. These results are consistent with the model proposed by Buxbaum and co-workers (16Li X. Zhang X. Ladiwala A.R. Du D. Yadav J.K. Tessier P.M. Wright P.E. Kelly J.W. Buxbaum J.N. Mechanisms of transthyretin inhibition of β-amyloid aggregation in vitro.J.

Jucker M. The amyloid state of proteins in human diseases.Cell. 2012; 148 (22424229): 1188-120310.1016/j.cell.2012.02.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). They also found that tetrameric TTR binds to soluble monomeric Aβ, thereby suppressing aggregation in vitro (16Li X. Zhang X. Ladiwala A.R. Du D. Yadav J.K. Tessier P.M. Wright P.E. Kelly J.W. Buxbaum J.N. Mechanisms of transthyretin inhibition of β-amyloid aggregation in vitro.J.

Others have also found an association between genetic stabilization of transthyretin and decreased risk of cerebrovascular disease (24Hornstrup L.S. Frikke-Schmidt R. Nordestgaard B.G. Tybjærg-Hansen A. Genetic stabilization of transthyretin, cerebrovascular disease, and life expectancy.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2013; 33 (23580146): 1441-144710.1161/ATVBAHA.113.301273Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Consistently, an additional study found that the stabilization of the tetrameric form of TTR promotes Aβ clearance in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (25Ribeiro C.A. Oliveira S.M. Guido L.F. Magalhães A. Valencia G. Arsequell G. Saraiva M.J. Cardoso I. Transthyretin stabilization by iododiflunisal promotes amyloid-β peptide clearance, decreases its deposition, and ameliorates cognitive deficits in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2014; 39 (24169237): 357-37010.3233/JAD-131355Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In our study, we did not find any effect of tetrameric TTR on Aβ42 cytotoxicity. For instance, the tetrameric nonamyloidogenic T119M variant did not inhibit Aβ42 cytotoxicity (Fig. 1). Consistently, the nonamyloidogenic variant L55P/T119M did not inhibit cytotoxicity, whereas the amyloidogenic L55P variant did (Fig. S1). Taken together, other studies and our results suggest that tetrameric TTR may be protective in vivo perhaps not by recruiting toxic oligomers, but by sequestering and promoting clearance of Aβ monomers. In contrast, dissociated TTR seems to inhibit Aβ cytotoxicity by binding to toxic oligomeric species triggering the formation of large nontoxic assemblies. Using computational tools, we generated a TTR-derived peptide that inhibits Aβ42 fibril formation and cellular toxicity (Fig. 3). This TTR-derived peptide, called TTR-S, contains the highly amyloidogenic segment TTR(105–117) followed by a polyarginine tag (Fig. S3). Our results are consistent with previous NMR studies showing that the interaction of TTR residues Lys15, Leu17, Ile107, Ala108, Ala109, Leu110, Ala120, and Val121 with Aβ contributes to the inhibition of Aβ fibril formation in vitro (16Li X. Zhang X. Ladiwala A.R. Du D. Yadav J.K. Tessier P.M. Wright P.E. Kelly J.W. Buxbaum J.N. Mechanisms of transthyretin inhibition of β-amyloid aggregation in vitro.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33 (24336709): 19423-1943310.1523/JNEUROSCI.2561-13.2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, others have shown that the segment TTR(106–117), one residue shorter, was capable of binding Aβ when immobilized on a membrane (8Du J. Cho P.Y. Yang D.T. Murphy R.M. Identification of β-amyloid–binding sites on transthyretin.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2012; 25 (22670059): 337-34510.1093/protein/gzs026Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the same peptide was not effective inhibiting Aβ aggregation in solution (21Cho P.Y. Joshi G. Johnson J.A. Murphy R.M. Transthyretin-derived peptides as β-amyloid inhibitors.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2014; 5 (24689444): 542-55110.1021/cn500014uCrossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), unless the peptide was made cyclic, therefore not amyloidogenic (26Cho P.Y. Joshi G. Boersma M.D. Johnson J.A. Murphy R.M. A cyclic peptide mimic of the β-amyloid binding domain on transthyretin.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2015; 6 (25713928): 778-78910.1021/cn500272aCrossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), probably because of the high amyloidogeneicity of this segment (Fig. S3). In our study, we solubilized TTR(105–117) by adding a charged tag, which confers higher solubility and also hinders self-aggregation (Fig. S3). The addition of a polyarginine tag was sufficient to convert a highly amyloidogenic peptide into an inhibitor of Aβ42 cellular toxicity even at substoichiometric concentrations (Fig. 4A). TTR-S inhibits Aβ42 oligomer formation while promoting the formation of nontoxic, nonamyloid, amorphous aggregates. Previous studies of the inhibition of Aβ cytotoxicity by TTR have revealed that TTR co-aggregates with Aβ oligomers into large nontoxic assemblies, thereby inhibiting cellular toxicity in vitro (9Cascella R. Conti S. Mannini B. Li X. Buxbaum J.N. Tiribilli B. Chiti F. Cecchi C. Transthyretin suppresses the toxicity of oligomers formed by misfolded proteins in vitro.Biochim. Biophys.

TTR-S mimics this effect and promotes the formation of large aggregates (Fig. 3B) that do not bind thioflavin T (Fig. 3A), do not show birefringence upon staining with Congo red (Fig. 3C), and display a non–β-secondary structure when subjected to CD (Fig. 3D).

In this study, the fine morphology of antennae as well as the typology, morphology and distribution of antennal sensilla were comprehensively examined by scanning electron microscopy. The antennal morphology of female and male are similar and consist of the scape, pedicel, and nine flagellomeres. No significant difference was detected in the length of each segment between two sexes, while the male antennae are much stronger than females. In total, six types of sensilla can be defined on antenna, including Böhm bristle, sensilla chaetica (with three subtypes), sensilla basiconica (with three subtypes), sensilla trichodea, sensilla placodea and sensilla coeloconica. It is worth noting that sensilla chaetica III distributed only on the fixed position of male antennae. In addition, the functional morphology of antennae of H. variegata were compared with other lady beetles from multiple perspectives. Specially, the function of sensilla were also discussed according to their morphology, location and information from previous studies."

Understanding men’s needs and concerns for testing could guide delivery of HIV testing services (HTS) to them. We assessed the prevalence of testing, associated factors and men’s perspectives on HIV testing in urban and peri-urban communities in Central Uganda. Methods and findings We conducted a parallel-convergent mixed-methods study among men in Kampala and Mpigi districts from August to September 2018. Using two-stage sampling, we selected 1340 men from Mpigi. We administered a structured questionnaire to collect data on HIV testing history, socio-demographics, self-reported HIV risk-related behaviors, barriers and facilitators to HIV testing. We also conducted 10 focus-groups with men from both districts to learn their perspectives on HIV testing. We used modified Poisson regression to assess factors associated with HIV testing and inductive thematic analysis to identify barriers and facilitators. Though 84.0% of men reported having tested for HIV, only 65.7% had tested in the past 12-months despite nearly all (96.7%) engaging in at least one HIV risk-related behavior. Men were more likely to have tested if aged 25–49 years, Catholic, with secondary or higher education and circumcised. Being married was associated with ever-testing while being widowed or divorced was associated with testing in past 12-months. Men who engaged in HIV risk-related behavior were less likely to have tested in the past 12-months. Qualitative findings showed that men varied in their perspectives about the need for testing, access to HTS and were uncertain of HIV testing and its outcomes. Conclusions Recent HIV testing among men remains low. Modifying testing strategies to attract men in all age groups could improve testing uptake, reduce gender disparity and initiate risk reduction interventions."

This study developed a wearable plantar pressure force measurement and analysis (WPPFMA) system based on a flexible sensor matrix film to monitor plantar pressure force in real time. The developed system comprised a flexible sensor matrix film embedded in the insole of the shoe, a wearable data acquisition (DAQ) device with a Bluetooth module, and dedicated software with an intuitive graphical user interface for displaying the plantar pressure force data from receivers by using a terminal unit (laptop or smart-phone). The flexible sensor matrix film integrated 16 piezoresistive cell sensors to detect pressure force at different anatomical zones of the plantar and under different body positions. The signals from the flexible sensor matrix film were collected using the DAQ module embedded in the shoe and transmitted to the receivers through Bluetooth. The real-time display and analysis software can monitor, visualize, and record the detailed plantar pressure force data, such as average pressure force, maximum pressure force, and pressure force distributions and variations over time. The outcomes of the trials in which the system was worn revealed the applicability of the developed WPPFMA system for monitoring plantar pressure force under static and dynamic wearing conditions. The plantar pressure force data derived from this system provide valuable insights for personal foot care, gait analysis, and clinical diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3048100439,"In vivo two-photon microscopy utilizing a nonlinear optical process enables, in living mouse brains, not only the visualization of morphologies and functions of neural networks in deep regions but also their optical manipulation at targeted sites with high spatial precision. Because the two-photon excitation efficiency is proportional to the square of the photon density of the excitation laser light at the focal position, optical aberrations induced by specimens mainly limit the maximum depth of observations or that of manipulations in the microscopy. To increase the two-photon excitation efficiency, we developed a method for evaluating the focal volume in living mouse brains. With this method, we modified the beam diameter of the excitation laser light and the value of the refractive index in the immersion liquid to maximize the excitation photon density at the focal position. These two modifications allowed the successful visualization of the finer structures of hippocampal CA1 neurons, as well as the intracellular calcium dynamics in cortical layer V astrocytes, even with our conventional two-photon microscopy system. Furthermore, it enabled focal laser ablation dissection of both single apical and single basal dendrites of cortical layer V pyramidal neurons. These simple modifications would enable us to investigate the contributions of single cells or single dendrites to the functions of local cortical networks."
https://openalex.org/W3048247075,"Background Chronic infected wounds are generally difficult to manage and treatment can be particularly challenging in resource-limited settings where diagnostic testing is not readily available. In this study, the epidemiology of microbial pathogens in chronically infected wounds in rural Ghana was assessed to support therapeutic choices for physicians. Methods Culture-based bacterial diagnostics including antimicrobial resistance testing were performed on samples collected from patients with chronic wounds at a hospital in Asante Akim North Municipality, Ghana. Fungal detection was performed by broad-range fungal PCR and sequencing of amplicons. Results In total, 105 patients were enrolled in the study, from which 207 potential bacterial pathogens were isolated. Enterobacteriaceae (n = 84, 41%) constituted the most frequently isolated group of pathogens. On species level, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 50, 24%) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 28, 14%) were predominant. High resistance rates were documented, comprising 29% methicillin resistance in S. aureus as well as resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in 33% and 58% of Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. One P. aeruginosa strain with carbapenem resistance was identified. The most frequently detected fungi were Candida tropicalis. Conclusions The pathogen distribution in chronic wounds in rural Ghana matched the internationally observed patterns with a predominance of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Very high resistance rates discourage antibiotic therapy but suggest an urgent need for microbiological diagnostic approaches, including antimicrobial resistance testing to guide the management of patients with chronic wounds in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3047960252,"Children's exposure to family and domestic violence (FDV) is a global public health concern and is considered one of the most common and severe stressors children can experience. While it is acknowledged that children who are exposed to FDV have poorer general health, there is a lack of data on the outcomes of children exposed to FDV. The use of longitudinal data has been suggested as a way to gain an understanding of the impact on children's long-term outcomes.Our cohort study used deidentified individual-level linked administrative data of children born 1987-2010, in Western Australia, who were exposed to FDV in the prenatal period (12 months prior to birth) to five years of age (early years).Children exposed to FDV are more likely to be hospitalised than non-exposed children. Children exposed to FDV in both the prenatal and early childhood period had a threefold increased odds of mental health hospitalisation. We found a significant increase in odds of pregnancy-related hospitalisation in FDV exposed children. When stratified by Aboriginal status, Aboriginal children had a higher proportion of hospitalisations than non-Aboriginal children.Exposed children have an increased likelihood for hospitalisation than non-exposed children. Within the exposed cohort differences were apparent between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children.

Our findings represent an important advance in the literature with respect to the burden of disease of children exposed to FDV."
https://openalex.org/W3048275146,"Irinotecan specifically targets topoisomerase I (topoI), and is used to treat various solid tumors, but only 13-32% of patients respond to the therapy. Now, it is understood that the rapid rate of topoI degradation in response to irinotecan causes irinotecan resistance. We have published that the deregulated DNA-PKcs kinase cascade ensures rapid degradation of topoI and is at the core of the drug resistance mechanism of topoI inhibitors, including irinotecan. We also identified CTD small phosphatase 1 (CTDSP1) (a nuclear phosphatase) as a primary upstream regulator of DNA-PKcs in response to topoI inhibitors. Previous reports showed that rabeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) inhibits CTDSP1 activity. The purpose of this study was to confirm the effects of rabeprazole on CTDSP1 activity and its impact on irinotecan-based therapy in colon cancer. Using differentially expressing CTDSP1 cells, we demonstrated that CTDSP1 contributes to the irinotecan sensitivity by preventing topoI degradation. Retrospective analysis of patients receiving irinotecan with or without rabeprazole has shown the effects of CTDSP1 on irinotecan response. These results indicate that CTDSP1 promotes sensitivity to irinotecan and rabeprazole prevents this effect, resulting in drug resistance. To ensure the best chance at effective treatment, rabeprazole may not be a suitable PPI for cancer patients treated with irinotecan."
https://openalex.org/W3047833754,"Mammals adapt to seasons using a neuroendocrine calendar defined by the photoperiodic change in the nighttime melatonin production. Under short photoperiod, melatonin inhibits the pars tuberalis production of TSHβ, which, in turn, acts on tanycytes to regulate the deiodinase 2/3 balance resulting in a finely tuned seasonal control of the intra-hypothalamic thyroid hormone T3. Despite the pivotal role of this T3 signaling for synchronizing reproduction with the seasons, T3 cellular targets remain unknown. One candidate is a population of hypothalamic neurons expressing Rfrp, the gene encoding the RFRP-3 peptide, thought to be integral for modulating rodent's seasonal reproduction. Here we show that nighttime melatonin supplementation in the drinking water of melatonin-deficient C57BL/6J mice mimics photoperiodic variations in the expression of the genes Tshb, Dio2, Dio3, and Rfrp, as observed in melatonin-proficient mammals. Notably, we report that this melatonin regulation of Rfrp expression is no longer observed in mice carrying a global mutation of the T3 receptor, TRα, but is conserved in mice with a selective neuronal mutation of TRα. In line with this observation, we find that TRα is widely expressed in the tanycytes. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the melatonin-driven T3 signal regulates RFRP-3 neurons through non-neuronal, possibly tanycytic, TRα."
https://openalex.org/W3048014675,"We previously reported that the non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors (CypIs)—cyclosporin A analog CRV431 and sanglifehrin analog NV556—efficiently inhibit HCV replication in vitro. In this study, we asked whether they can also reduce HCV replication in vivo. We found that a single oral administration of CRV431 and NV556 to HCV-infected humanized-liver mice drastically reduced HCV blood levels. The antiviral effect was observed when CRV431 or NV556 were each individually administered with HCV, 3, 6 weeks or even 3 months post-infection when viral replication is robust. These results were confirmed in chimeric mice implanted with human hepatocytes isolated from three distinct donors. Remarkably, no viral rebound was observed 5 months after a single dose administration of 50 mg/kg of CRV431 or NV556 four weeks post-HCV infection, indicating the possibility of suppression of an established viral infection. Since we recently demonstrated that both CRV431 and NV556 also inhibit the development of liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in nonviral-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis mouse models, our present data suggest that the two entirely structurally different CypIs—CRV431 and NV556—derived from unrelated natural products, represent attractive partners to current direct-acting agent (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C and liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3048212351,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease, and inflammation within an arthritic joint plays a critical role in disease progression. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically IL-1 and TNF-α, induce aberrant expression of catabolic and degradative enzymes and inflammatory cytokines in OA and result in a challenging environment for cartilage repair and regeneration. MicroRNAs (miRNAS) are small noncoding RNAs and are important regulatory molecules that act by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to reduce protein synthesis and have been implicated in many diseases, including OA. The goal of this study was to understand the mechanisms of miRNA regulation of the transcriptome of tissue-engineered cartilage in response to IL-1β and TNF-α using an in vitro murine induced pluripotent stem cell (miPSC) model system. We performed miRNA and mRNA sequencing to determine the temporal and dynamic responses of genes to specific inflammatory cytokines as well as miRNAs that are differentially expressed (DE) in response to both cytokines or exclusively to IL-1β or TNF-α. Through integration of mRNA and miRNA sequencing data, we created networks of miRNA-mRNA interactions which may be controlling the response to inflammatory cytokines. Within the networks, hub miRNAs, miR-29b-3p, miR-17-5p, and miR-20a-5p, were identified. As validation of these findings, we found that delivery of miR-17-5p and miR-20a-5p mimics significantly decreased degradative enzyme activity levels while also decreasing expression of inflammation-related genes in cytokine-treated cells. This study utilized an integrative approach to determine the miRNA interactome controlling the response to inflammatory cytokines and novel mediators of inflammation-driven degradation in tissue-engineered cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W3042472332,"The present study introduces the German version of the original version of the Music@Home questionnaire developed in the UK, which systematically evaluates musical engagement in the home environment of young children. Two versions are available, an Infant version for children aged three to 23 months and a Preschool version for children aged two to five and a half years. For the present study, the original Music@Home questionnaire was translated from English into German and 656 caregivers completed the questionnaire online. A confirmatory factor analysis showed moderate to high fit indices for both versions, confirming the factor structure of the original questionnaire. Also, the reliability coefficients for the subscales (Parental beliefs, Child engagement with music, Parent initiation of singing, Parent initiation of music-making for the Infant version and Parental beliefs, Child engagement with music, Parent initiation of music behavior and Breadth of musical exposure for the Preschool version) ranged from moderate to high fits. Furthermore, the test-retest analysis (N = 392) revealed high correlations for the general factor and all subscales confirming their internal reliability. Additionally, we included language questionnaires for children of two and three years of age. Results showed that higher scores on the Music@Home questionnaire were moderately associated with better language skills in two-year-olds (N = 118). In sum, the study presents the validated German Music@Home questionnaire, which shows good psychometric properties. The two versions of the questionnaire are available for use in order to assess home musical engagement of young children, which could be of interest in many areas of developmental research."
https://openalex.org/W3048016581,"This study investigated the caries-preventive effect of 445 nm laser radiation in combination with fluoride on the prevention of white spot lesions. Previously, several studies have indicated the ability of 488 nm argon ion laser irradiation to reduce early enamel demineralization. A diode laser (445 nm) could be an alternative technology for possible caries-preventive potential. Each sample of a group of seventeen caries-free bovine teeth was treated in four different ways on four different zones of the labial surface: control/no treatment (C), laser irradiation only (L) (0.3 W, 60 s and applied dose of 90 J/cm2), amine fluoride application only (10,000 ppm and pH 3.9) (F), and amine fluoride application followed by laser irradiation (FL). After treatment, the teeth were subjected to a demineralization solution (pH 4.3 for 48 h at 37 °C) to induce subsurface lesions. After sectioning, the teeth were examined by light microscopy. Three teeth were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The depths of the subsurface lesions in the C, L, F, and FL groups were 103.01 (± 13.04), 96.99 (± 14.51), 42.59 (± 17.13), and 24.35 (± 11.38) μm, respectively. The pairwise group comparison showed the following results: p < 0.001 for FL versus C, FL versus L, F versus C, and F versus L, p = 0.019 for FL versus F and p = 0.930 for L versus C. The SEM micrographs support the light-microscopic examination. The results of the current study have shown that using relatively low irradiation settings of 445 nm laser on fluoridated enamel may be effective for prevention of white spot lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3048036496,"Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from young and healthy donors are immunoprivileged and have the potential to treat numerous degenerative diseases. However, recent reviews of clinical trials report poor long-term survival of transplanted cells in the recipient that turned down the enthusiasm regarding MSC therapies. Increasing evidence now confirm that though initially immunoprivileged, MSCs eventually become immunogenic after transplantation in the ischemic or hypoxic environment of diseased tissues and are rejected by the host immune system. We performed in vitro (in rat and human cells) and in vivo (in a rat model) investigations to understand the mechanisms of the immune switch in the phenotype of MSCs. The immunoprivilege of MSCs is preserved by the absence of cell surface immune antigen, major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) molecule. We found that the ATPase subunit of 19S proteasome regulates MHC-II biosynthesis in MSCs. Exposure to hypoxia upregulates Sug1 in MSCs and its binding to class II transactivator (CIITA), a coactivator of MHC-II transcription. Sug1 binding to CIITA in hypoxic MSCs promotes the acetylation and K63 ubiquitination of CIITA leading to its activation and translocation to the nucleus, and ultimately MHC-II upregulation. In both rat and human MSCs, knocking down Sug1 inactivated MHC-II and preserved immunoprivilege even following hypoxia. In a rat model of myocardial infarction, transplantation of Sug1-knockdown MSCs in ischemic heart preserved immunoprivilege and improved the survival of transplanted cells. Therefore, the current study provides novel mechanisms of post-transplantation loss of immunoprivilege of MSCs. This study may help in facilitating better planning for future clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3048141378,"Metabolic reprograming is a hallmark of cancer, and the polyamine metabolic network is dysregulated in many cancers. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine synthesis in the polyamine metabolic network. In many cancer cells, ODC is over-expressed, so this enzyme has been an attracting anti-cancer drug target. In the catalysis axis (pathway), ODC converts ornithine to putrescine. Meanwhile, ODC's activity is regulated by protein-protein interactions (PPIs), including the ODC-OAZ1-AZIN1 PPI axis and its monomer-dimer equilibrium. Previous studies showed that when ODC's activity is inhibited, the PPIs might counteract the inhibition efficiency. Therefore, we proposed that multipurpose inhibitors that can simultaneously inhibit ODC's activity and perturb the PPIs would be very valuable as drug candidates and molecular tools. To discover multipurpose ODC inhibitors, we established a computational pipeline by combining positive screening and negative screening. We used this pipeline for the forward screening of multipurpose ligands that might inhibit ODC's activity, block ODC-OAZ1 interaction and enhance ODC non-functional dimerization. With a combination of different experimental assays, we identified three multipurpose ODC inhibitors. At last, we showed that one of these inhibitors is a promising drug candidate. This work demonstrated that our computational pipeline is useful for discovering multipurpose ODC inhibitors, and multipurpose inhibitors would be very valuable. Similar with ODC, there are a lot of proteins in human proteome that act as both enzymes and PPI components. Therefore, this work is not only presenting new molecular tools for polyamine study, but also providing potential insights and protocols for discovering multipurpose inhibitors to target more important protein targets."
https://openalex.org/W3048310045,"In this study, washing tests were performed using samples prepared by contaminating fabrics with hemoglobin, and a kinetic analysis was conducted based the probability density functional method, which expresses the cleaning power using two parameters σrl (related to the cleaning mechanism) and μrl (related to the level of cleaning power). This method allows for the processing of uncertainties specific to protein washing under the assumption that the soil adhesion and detergency are in accordance with a normal distribution. A certain amount of hemoglobin solution was soaked in a cloth, dried, and steam-treated, and then used as a sample for a cleaning test. Two parameters σrl and μrl were calculated based on the detergency (%) after 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, and 20 min of washing with respect to different pH and temperature levels, and different sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) concentration and temperature levels. Based on the results, the value of σrl indicated that the hemoglobin was removed by the dissolving action. In addition, μrl increased in accordance with an increase in the pH, SDS concentration, and temperature. With respect to μrl, the relationship of ΔX + ΔY = Δ(X+Y) was observed in several cases, where ΔX represents the effect of the pH or SDS concentration, ΔY is the temperature effect, and Δ(X+Y) is the combined effect. Therefore, there may be an additive relationship between the pH and temperature effects, and the SDS concentration and temperature effects."

The associations of sUmod with renin and aldosterone and with the vasoconstrictive prohormone C-terminal pro-endothelin-1 (CT-proET-1) were analyzed in 1079 participants and in 618 participants, respectively, using linear regression models.After multivariable adjustment including sex, age, eGFR, BMI, fasting glucose, current smoking, previous stroke and myocardial infarction, sUmod was inversely associated with arterial hypertension (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.68-0.91; p = 0.001). SUmod was not significantly associated with renin and aldosterone after adjustment for sex, age and eGFR. However, sUmod was inversely associated with CT-proET-1 (β -0.19 ± 0.04; p < 0.001) after adjustment for sex, age, eGFR, BMI, arterial hypertension, fasting glucose, current smoking, previous stroke and myocardial infarction. The association with CT-proET-1 was stronger in participants with hypertension (β -0.22 ± 0.04) than in normotensive participants (β -0.13 ± 0.06; p for interaction hypertension = 0.003 in the model adjusted for hypertension).SUmod was inversely associated with arterial hypertension and the vasoconstrictive prohormone CT-proET-1, suggesting direct or indirect effects of sUmod on blood pressure regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3048353987,"Collective emotion is the synchronous convergence of an effective response across individuals toward a specific event or object. Previous studies have focused on the transmission of cyber collective emotion; however, little attention has been paid to the transmission of collective emotion in face-to-face interactions. Using an experimental design, we examined how emotions are transmitted from some members to the whole group in face-to-face situations. We used a news report of a social event as an emotion stimulus to induce anger and disgust in 158 middle school students aged 12 to 15, with an average age of 13.20 years (SD = 0.651) We randomly assigned one-third of the participants to be “transmitters,” while the others were “receivers.” Transmitters shared their feelings with receivers; then, receivers communicated with other group members. The results indicated that negative collective emotions were transmitted from high- to low-intensity members, which converged through the effect of emotional contagion. It accumulated through the effect of an emotional circle, during which the feedback reinforced emotion intensity. The collective emotion transmission model comprised emotion diffusion, contagion, and accumulation. This model elucidates the intrinsic features of collective emotion transmission, enriches the research on collective emotion, and provides theoretical references for monitoring and managing future public events."
https://openalex.org/W3048042486,"Two experiments were conducted: (1) to evaluate the effect of ensiling time and grain source on dietary nitrogen fractions; and (2) to verify the influence of concentrate level, processing method and grain source on intake, microbial efficiency, and digestibility by young Nellore bulls. In Experiment 1, corn and sorghum grains were milled, reconstituted to 35% moisture, and ensiled in a bag silo for 10 different times. There were three replications per ensiling time and grain source. Samples from each replication were analyzed in triplicate for total nitrogen (N), non-protein nitrogen (NPN), soluble N, insoluble N, and neutral detergent insoluble nitrogen (NDIN). In Experiment 2, five Nellore bulls were used in a 5 × 5 Latin square design. Four diets were comprised of 28.4% corn silage, 10.7% supplement, and 60.9% dry ground corn, dry ground sorghum, reconstituted and ensiled corn, or reconstituted and ensiled ground sorghum. An additional diet comprised of 45% corn silage, 10.7% supplement, and 44.3% dry ground corn (Roughage+) was used. Each experimental period lasted 22 days, with an adaptation period of 14 days followed by 5 days of total feces and urine collection and 3 days of collecting omasal samples. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS 9.4. The reconstitution and ensiling process reduced (P < 0.05) the insoluble N fraction, increased (P < 0.05) non-protein nitrogen of corn and sorghum grains, tended (P = 0.052) to increase microbial efficiency, and increased (P < 0.05) intestinal and total digestion of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), and starch. The concentrate level affected neither (P > 0.05) DM intake nor rumen pH. On the other hand, bulls fed diets based on 72% concentrate showed greater (P < 0.05) DM, OM, and CP digestibility compared with those fed a diet based on 55% concentrate. In addition, animals fed diets based on corn grains (both reconstituted and ensiled or dry) presented greater (P < 0.05) intestinal and total starch digestion compared to those fed sorghum grain. Therefore, the reconstitution process can reduce the insoluble N fraction and increase nutrient availability."
https://openalex.org/W3048076048,"Maternal dexamethasone decreases the body length of the newborn. However, whether dexamethasone inhibits the development of the growth plate of the fetal long bone is still unknown. Here, we found that lengths of fetal femur and growth plate were both shorter in the fetuses with maternal dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg.d from gestation day 9 to 20), with a decreased proteoglycan content of the growth plate in the fetal rat. Notable decreases in both the gene expression and H3K9 acetylation of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (Ugdh) gene, which codes a key enzyme in the proteoglycan biosynthesis in the chondrocyte, were also observed. Meanwhile, up-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), specific protein 3 (Sp3), and histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) gene expression were detected in the fetal growth plate. Similar changes were also observed in the chondrogenic rat bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with excessive exogenous dexamethasone. However, antagonizing GR with RU486 and silencing Hdac1 or Sp3 with specific siRNAs could all stimulate the H3K9 acetylation and gene expression of Ugdh previously inhibited by dexamethasone. Meanwhile, dexamethasone also induced the nuclear translocation of GR, which further directly bound to the Ugdh promoter and interacted with HDAC1 and Sp3, respectively. Collectively, our study revealed that maternal dexamethasone induced the direct binding of GR to the Ugdh promoter of the chondrocyte in the rat fetal growth plate, which recruited HDAC1 and Sp3, induced deacetylation of the H3K9, and subsequently inhibited Ugdh gene expression. Such changes further led to attenuated proteoglycan synthesis in the developing chondrocyte and therefore disrupted the development of growth plate and fetal long bone."
https://openalex.org/W3047682944,"BACKGROUND Botswana introduced the HBV vaccine at birth for all newborns in 2000. To the best of our knowledge, since the introduction of HBV vaccination, there have been limited data for vaccine response to HBV and its impact on early childhood HBV infections among children HIV exposed but uninfected in Botswana. AIMS To determine the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV vaccine response in 18 months old children HIV exposed but uninfected in Botswana. METHODS Stored plasma samples from 304 children at 18 months of age and 287 mothers from delivery were tested for HBsAg. Mothers with positive HBsAg had HBV DNA level tested, and their HBV genotypes were determined by amplifying a 415-base pair (bp) region of the surface gene. Plasma samples from children exposed to HIV were tested for hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) titers. RESULTS No children (0 of 304) were positive for HBsAg at 18 months while 5 (1.74%) of 287 HIV-positive mothers were HBsAg positive. Four of the HBsAg positive mothers were infected with genotype A1, while 1 was infected with genotype E. The median anti-HBs titer in children was 174 mIU/mL [QR: 70, 457]. Three (1.1%) of 269 children had an inadequate vaccine response (<10 mIU/mL), while 266 (98.9%) of 269 had protective immunity. However, when using the ≥100mIU/mL threshold, only 170 (63.2%) of 269 children had complete protection. CONCLUSION No HBsAg positivity was identified in a cohort of children HIV exposed but uninfected. The absence of HBsAg positives was associated with good HBV vaccine responses and low maternal HBsAg prevalence in Botswana."
https://openalex.org/W3047926031,"Karst systems represent an important carbon sink worldwide. However, several phenomena such as the CO2 degassing and the exchange of cave air return a considerable amount of CO2 to the atmosphere. It is therefore of paramount importance to understand the contribution of the ecosystem to the carbon budget of karst areas. In this study conducted in a mid-succession ecosystem developed on abandoned karst grassland, two types of model were assessed, estimating the gross primary production (GPP) or the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) based on seven years of eddy covariance data (2013–2019): (1) a quadratic vegetation index-based empirical model with five alternative vegetation indices as proxies of GPP and NEE, and (2) the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) which is a light use efficiency model to estimate only GPP. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was the best proxy for NEE whereas SAVI performed very similarly to EVI in the case of GPP in the empirical model setting. The empirical model performed better than the VPM model which tended to underestimate GPP. Therefore, for this ecosystem, we suggest the use of the empirical model provided that the quadratic relationship observed persists. However, the VPM model would be a good alternative under a changing climate, as it is rooted in the understanding of the photosynthesis process, if the scalars it involves could be improved to better estimate GPP."
https://openalex.org/W3048319593,"Normal aging involves changes in the ability to acquire, consolidate and recall new information. It has been recently proposed that the reconsolidation process is also affected in older adults. Reconsolidation is triggered after reminder presentation, allowing memories to be modified: they can be impaired, strengthened or changed in their content. In young adults it was previously shown that the presentation of repetitive reminders induces memory strengthening one day after reactivation and the presentation of at least one reminder increases memory persistence several days after reactivation. However, until now this process has remained elusive in older adults. We hypothesize that older adults need a stronger reminder to induce memory strengthening through the reconsolidation process than young adults. To test this, we perform a three-day experiment. On day 1, participants learned 15 sound-word associations, on day 2 they received no reminders (NR group), one reminder (R group) or two rounds of reactivations (Rx2 group). Finally, they were tested on day 7. We found that, contrary to our hypothesis, older adults show a memory improvement triggered by repeated labilization/reconsolidation processes to an equal extent than young adults. These results open new perspectives into the use of reconsolidation to improve daily acquired information and the development of therapeutic home used tools to produce memory enhancement in healthy older adults or those with cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W3047628861,"Increased endothelial permeability leads to excessive exudation of plasma proteins and leukocytes in the interstitium, which characterizes several vascular diseases including acute lung injury. The myosin light chain kinase long (MYLK-L) isoform is canonically known to regulate the endothelial permeability by phosphorylating myosin light chain (MLC-P). Compared to the short MYLK isoform, MYLK-L contains an additional stretch of ~919 amino acid at the N-terminus of unknown function. We show that thapsigargin and thrombin-induced SOCE was markedly reduced in Mylk-L-/- endothelial cells (EC) or MYLK-L-depleted human EC. These agonists also failed to increase endothelial permeability in MYLK-L-depleted EC and Mylk-L-/- lungs, thus demonstrating the novel role of MYLK-L-induced SOCE in increasing vascular permeability. MYLK-L augmented SOCE by increasing endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) junctions and STIM1 translocation to these junctions. Transduction of N-MYLK domain (amino acids 1-919 devoid of catalytic activity) into Mylk-L-/- EC rescued SOCE to the level seen in control EC in a STIM1-dependent manner. N-MYLK-induced SOCE augmented endothelial permeability without MLC-P via an actin-binding motif, DVRGLL. Liposomal-mediated delivery of N-MYLK mutant but not ∆DVRGLL-N-MYLK mutant in Mylk-L-/- mice rescued vascular permeability increase in response to endotoxin, indicating that targeting of DVRGLL motif within MYLK-L may limit SOCE-induced vascular hyperpermeability."
https://openalex.org/W3048025033,"Background Uganda ranks third in the number of deaths attributable to malaria and has some of the highest recorded malaria transmission rates in the general population. Malaria in Pregnancy is associated with detrimental effects for the mother and unborn baby and these effects seem to have long term effects and consequences on the life of the baby. Despite the preventive measures put in place by the World Health Organization in antenatal care, the burden of malaria in pregnancy is still high. We determined the use of malaria preventive strategies during pregnancy and the presence of plasmodium infection, anemia, and low birth weight babies at delivery among parturient women at Mbale regional referral hospital in eastern Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 210 women delivering at MRRH between July 2017 and January 2018. Information on demographics, antenatal care, and prevention practices was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Maternal venous blood and cord blood samples were screened for Plasmodium infection by both microscopy of Giemsa-stained blood films and Plasmodium falciparum rapid diagnostic test (pf. HPR2 mRDT). Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was done on cord blood. The presence of anemia was determined by the use of an automated hemoglobin analyzer. Data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics. Results Of the 210 women, 3 (1.4%) and 19(9.1%) tested positive for malaria by using Giemsa stained blood smear microscopy and malaria rapid diagnosticMRDT tests respectively. PCR detected 4(%) of Plasmodium in cord blood. Twenty-nine percent of the women had anaemia and 11 (5.2%) had low birth weight babies. Only 23.3% of the women received at least three doses of IPTp-SP and 57.9% reported sleeping under an Insecticide Treated Net the night before the survey. The women who reported sleeping under a mosquito net the previous night (OR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.24–1.86) and those who reported taking fansidar as a directly observed therapy (OR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.04–2.39) appeared to have few chances of getting plasmodium infection though the findings were not statistically significant. Conclusion The effective use of malaria preventive strategies (IPT-SP and Insecticide Treated Nets) was generally low. Most of the women took less than three doses of SP and there was no strict adherence to the recommended directly observed therapy. The prevalence of Plasmodium infection during pregnancy was low though maternal anaemia and low birth weight were relatively high."

Biomarker-based molecular testing represents a promising tool for risk stratifying these lesions. We evaluated the utility of a panel of ultraviolet (UV) radiation-biomarker genes in distinguishing between benign and transformation-prone AKs and SCCs. The expression of the UV-biomarker genes in 31 SCC and normal skin (NS) pairs and 10 AK/NS pairs was quantified using the NanoString nCounter system. Biomarker testing models were built using logistic regression models with leave-one-out cross validation in the training set. The best model to classify AKs versus SCCs (area under curve (AUC) 0.814, precision score 0.833, recall 0.714) was constructed using a top-ranked set of 13 UV-biomarker genes. Another model based on a 15-gene panel was developed to differentiate histologically concerning from less concerning SCCs (AUC 1, precision score 1, recall 0.714). Finally, 12 of the UV-biomarker genes were differentially expressed between AKs and SCCs, while 10 genes were uniquely expressed in the more concerning SCCs. UV-biomarker gene subsets demonstrate dynamic utility as molecular tools to classify and risk stratify AK and SCC lesions, which will complement histopathologic diagnosis to guide treatment of high-risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W3048227205,"Mortality disparities are influenced by race and poverty. There is limited information about whether poverty influences biologic markers of mortality risk. Emerging data suggests that growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is associated with mortality; however, the interplay between GDF15, sociodemographic factors and mortality is not known. We sought to evaluate the interactions between GDF15 and sex, race and poverty status on mortality. Serum GDF15 was measured in 1036 African American and white middle-aged men and women above and below 125% of the Federal poverty status from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. Multivariable adjusted Cox regression models were used to assess the association between log-transformed GDF15 (logGDF15) and 12-year mortality outcomes (all-cause, cardiovascular- and cancer-specific outcomes) and interactions with sex, race and poverty status. Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess significance of the interaction terms. Median GDF15 was 655.2 pg/mL (IQR = 575.1). During 12.2 years of follow-up, 331 died of which 94 cardiovascular- and 87 were cancer-specific deaths. One unit of increase in logGDF15 was associated with a hazard ratio for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular- and cancer-specific mortality of 2.26 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.94-2.64), 2.74 (95%CI, 2.06-3.63) and 1.41 (95%CI, 1.00-2.00), respectively. There was an interaction between logGDF15 and poverty status on all-cause mortality (p<0.05). The GDF15×poverty status interaction term improved model calibration for all-cause mortality. Our study provides the first evidence that the effect of elevated GDF15 on all-cause mortality is modified by poverty status."

Since 2008, DENV-2 circulated at a low level in Lao PDR but its epidemiologic profile changed at the end of 2018. Indeed, the number of confirmed DENV-2 cases suddenly increased in October 2018 and DENV-2 became predominant at the country level in early 2019. We developed a Genotype Screening Protocol (GSP) to determine the origin(s) of the Lao DENV-2 and study their genetic polymorphism. With a good correlation with full envelope gene sequencing data, this molecular epidemiology tool evidence the co-circulation of two highly polymorphic DENV-2 genotypes, i.e. Asian I and Cosmopolitan genotypes, over the last five years, suggesting multiple introductions of DENV-2 in the country. GSP approach provides relevant first line information that may help countries with limited laboratory resources to reinforce their capabilities to DENV-2 and to follow the epidemics progresses and assess situations at the regional level."
https://openalex.org/W3048059694,"The city of Clarkston (Georgia) is home to many refugees and immigrants, including Bhutanese and Burmese populations. Use of gutka and paan masala is common in these populations. While gutka and paan masala contain toxic ingredients including carcinogens, little research has examined general use, perceptions of risk, cultural norms, and access to these products among Bhutanese and Burmese populations in the southern U.S. This study uses focus groups and key informant interviews to develop an understanding of gutka and paan masala use among Bhutanese and Burmese refugee populations residing in Clarkston, focusing in particular on knowledge and perceptions of harm, patterns of and reasons for use, access to gutka and paan masala, and resources for cessation and prevention of gutka and paan masala use. We conducted 21 focus groups with Bhutanese and Burmese youths and adults and 11 key informant interviews. We analyzed data using MAXQDA and a grounded theory approach. Emerging themes included mixed understandings of ingredients and harms associated with gutka and paan masala use. The continued use of paan masala was perceived to be due to cultural traditions. Youths, particularly Bhutanese, were perceived as a rising group of users of gutka and paan masala. Widespread availability and accessibility in Clarkston made it easy for both adults and youths to acquire and use gutka and paan masala. Few participants knew about prevention efforts or resources in their communities. In conclusion, culturally-relevant awareness and education programs as well as health promotion materials regarding gutka and paan masala are much needed in Bhutanese and Burmese communities. More regulatory actions are needed, such as better warning signs in businesses to inform customers of ingredients in these products and their health risks, age restrictions on gutka and paan masala purchase, and compliance checks."
https://openalex.org/W3048164893,"Background Early detection of breast cancer can improve survival rates and decrease mortality rates. This study investigates whether there are significant differences in participation in breast screening among women born in Muslim countries compared to women born in Non-Muslim countries and Australia. Methods Screening data from January 1st, 2000 to December 31st, 2013 from the Breast Screen Victoria Registry (BSV) was linked with hospital records from the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset (VAED). Countries having more than 50% of their population as Muslim were categorised as Muslim countries. Age adjusted rates were calculated for women born in Muslim and Non-Muslim countries and compared with the Australian age adjusted rates. Logistic regression assessed the association between screening status and other factors which include country of birth, marital status, age and socio-economic status. Results Women born in Muslim countries (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.68–0.72) and in other Non-Muslim countries (OR = 0.87, 95%CI = 0.86–0.88) had lower odds of participation in breast screening than Australian born women. Women aged 60–64 years (OR = 1.42, 95%CI = 1.40–1.44) had higher odds of participation in the BreastScreen program than 50–54 age group. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights to understanding breast screening participation among women born in Muslim countries residing in Victoria. This population level study contributes to the broader knowledge of screening participation of women born in Muslim countries, an understudied population group in Australia and across the world. This study has implications for breast screening programs as it highlights the need for culturally sensitive approaches to support breast screening participation among women born in Muslim countries."
https://openalex.org/W3047099438,"The egg stage is one of the most critical periods in the life history of silkworms, during which physiological processes such as sex determination, tissue organ formation and differentiation, diapause and pigmentation occur. In addition, egg color gradually emerges around 36h after oviposition. The red egg mutant rep-1, which was recently discovered in the C1(H) wild-type, C1(H) exhibits a brown egg color. In this study, the transcriptome of the eggs was analyzed 36h after oviposition. Between the rep-1 mutant and the C1(H) wild-type, 800 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 325 up-regulated genes and 475 down-regulated genes. These DEGs were mainly involved in biological processes (metabolic process, cellular process, biological regulation and regulation of biological process and localization), cellular components (membrane, membrane part, cell, cell part and organelle) and molecular functions (binding, catalytic activity, transporter activity, structural molecule activity and molecular transducer activity). The pathway enrichment of these DEGs was performed based on the KEGG database, and the results indicated that these DEGs were mainly involved in pathways in the following categories: metabolic pathways, longevity-regulating pathway-multiple species, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisome, carbon metabolism and purine metabolism. Further analysis showed that a large number of silkworm growth- and development-related genes and ommochrome synthesis- and metabolism-related genes were differentially expressed, most of which were up-regulated in the mutant. Our research findings provide new experimental evidence for research on ommochrome pigmentation and lay the foundation for further research on the mechanism of the rep-1 mutant."
https://openalex.org/W3047658414,"Pierce's disease is of major concern for grapevine (Vitis vinifera) production wherever the bacterial pathogen Xylella fastidiosa and its vectors are present. Long-term management includes the deployment of resistant grapevines such as those containing the PdR1 locus from the wild grapevine species Vitis arizonica, which do not develop Pierce's disease symptoms upon infection. However, little is understood about how the PdR1 locus functions to prevent disease symptom development. Therefore, we assessed the concentrations of plant defense-associated compounds called phenolics in healthy and X. fastidiosa-infected PdR1-resistant and susceptible grapevine siblings over time. Soluble foliar phenolic levels, especially flavonoids, in X. fastidiosa-infected PdR1-resistant grapevines were discovered to be significantly lower than those in infected susceptible grapevines. Therefore, it was hypothesized that PdR1-resistant grapevines, by possessing lowered flavonoid levels, affects biofilm formation and causes reduced X. fastidiosa intra-plant colonization, thus limiting the ability to increase pathogen populations and cause Pierce's disease. These results therefore reveal that differences in plant metabolite levels might be a component of the mechanisms that PdR1 utilizes to prevent Pierce's disease."
