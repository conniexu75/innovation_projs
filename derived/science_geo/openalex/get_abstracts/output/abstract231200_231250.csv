https://openalex.org/W1977500292,"The biology of Kaposi sarcoma is poorly understood because the dominant cell type in Kaposi sarcoma lesions is not known1,2,3,4. We show by gene expression microarrays that neoplastic cells of Kaposi sarcoma are closely related to lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and that Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV)5,6 infects both LECs and blood vascular endothelial cells (BECs) in vitro. The gene expression microarray profiles of infected LECs and BECs show that KSHV induces transcriptional reprogramming of both cell types. The lymphangiogenic molecules VEGF-D and angiopoietin-2 were elevated in the plasma of individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and Kaposi sarcoma. These data show that the gene expression profile of Kaposi sarcoma resembles that of LECs, that KSHV induces a transcriptional drift in both LECs and BECs and that lymphangiogenic molecules are involved in the pathogenesis of Kaposi sarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2021517173,"High-resolution interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) permanent scatterer data allow us to resolve the rates and variations in the rates of slow-moving landslides. Satellite-to-ground distances (range changes) on landslides increase at rates of 5 to 7 millimeters per year, indicating average downslope sliding velocities from 27 to 38 millimeters per year. Time-series analysis shows that displacement occurs mainly during the high-precipitation season; during the 1997–1998 El Niño event, rates of range change increased to as much as 11 millimeters per year. The observed nonlinear relationship of creep and precipitation rates suggests that increased pore fluid pressures within the shallow subsurface may initiate and accelerate these features. Changes in the slope of a hill resulting from increases in the pore pressure and lithostatic stress gradients may then lead to landslides."
https://openalex.org/W2014102714,"Endogenous opioid binding to μ receptors is hypothesized to mediate natural rewards and has been proposed to be the basis of infant attachment behavior. Here, we report that μ-opioid receptor knockout mouse pups emit fewer ultrasonic vocalizations when removed from their mothers but not when exposed to cold or male mice odors. Moreover these knockout pups do not show a preference toward their mothers' cues and do not show ultrasonic calls potentiation after brief maternal exposure. Results from this study may indicate a molecular mechanism for diseases characterized by deficits in attachment behavior, such as autism or reactive attachment disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2019964232,"Retinitis pigmentosa is an untreatable, inherited retinal disease that leads to blindness. The disease initiates with the loss of night vision due to rod photoreceptor degeneration, followed by irreversible, progressive loss of cone photoreceptor1,2,3. Cone loss is responsible for the main visual handicap, as cones are essential for day and high-acuity vision4. Their loss is indirect, as most genes associated with retinitis pigmentosa are not expressed by these cells. We previously showed that factors secreted from rods are essential for cone viability5,6,7,8. Here we identified one such trophic factor by expression cloning and named it rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF). RdCVF is a truncated thioredoxin-like protein specifically expressed by photoreceptors. The identification of this protein offers new treatment possibilities for retinitis pigmentosa."
https://openalex.org/W1995687483,"The sphingolipid ceramide negatively regulates insulin action by inhibiting Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), a serine/threonine kinase that is a central regulator of glucose uptake and anabolic metabolism. Despite considerable attention, the molecular mechanism accounting for this action of ceramide has remained both elusive and controversial. Herein we utilized deletion constructs encoding two different functional domains of Akt/PKB to identify which region of the enzyme conferred responsiveness to ceramide. Surprisingly the findings obtained with these separate domains reveal that ceramide blocks insulin stimulation of Akt/PKB by two independent mechanisms. First, using the isolated pleckstrin homology domain, we found that ceramide specifically blocks the translocation of Akt/PKB, but not its upstream activator phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, to the plasma membrane. Second, using a construct lacking this pleckstrin homology domain, which does not require translocation for activation, we found that ceramide stimulates the dephosphorylation of Akt/PKB by protein phosphatase 2A. Collectively these findings identify at least two independent mechanisms by which excessive ceramide accumulation in peripheral tissues could contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Moreover the results obtained provide a unifying theory to account for the numerous dissenting reports investigating the actions of ceramide toward Akt/PKB.

Moreover the results obtained provide a unifying theory to account for the numerous dissenting reports investigating the actions of ceramide toward Akt/PKB. A strong correlation between intramyocellular lipid levels and the severity of insulin resistance has prompted investigators to hypothesize that insulin resistance results from the ectopic accumulation of fat in tissues other than adipose (1Schmitz-Peiffer C.

Specifically, many researchers have speculated that increased availability of lipids to peripheral tissues causes insulin resistance by promoting the accumulation of fat-derived metabolites capable of inhibiting insulin action (1Schmitz-Peiffer C.

Numerous recent studies support the hypothesis that the aberrant deposition of the sphingolipid ceramide in skeletal muscle and liver contributes to the development of insulin resistance resulting from lipid oversupply.

Numerous hormones, growth factors, and transforming oncogenes activate Akt/PKB using a redundant signaling pathway triggered by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, a lipid kinase that catalyzes production of 3′-phosphoinositides (i.e. phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) (for reviews, see Refs. 16Summers S.A.

These unique phospholipids serve as docking sites for cytoplasmic proteins with pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, including the serine/threonine kinases Akt/PKB and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). 3′-Phosphoinositides displace the PH domain of Akt/PKB, exposing regulatory phosphorylation sites in the catalytic/regulatory domain of the enzyme (e.g. Ser-473 and Thr-308 for the Akt1/PKBα isoform). Moreover, by recruiting both Akt/PKB and PDK1 to common membrane domains, the two enzymes come into closer proximity, facilitating the phosphorylation of the Thr-308 residue by PDK1. 3′-Phosphoinositides, through a second mechanism not involving the recruitment of Akt/PKB to the plasma membrane, promote Ser-473 phosphorylation, which is required for subsequent Thr-308 phosphorylation (18Scheid M.P.

Ceramide levels in various insulin-resistant rodents and humans are approximately twice those of insulin-sensitive controls (3Turinsky J. O'Sullivan D.M. Bayly B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16880-16885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kim J.K. Fillmore J.J. Chen Y. Yu C. Moore I.K. Pypaert M. Lutz E.P. Kako Y. Velez-Carrasco W. Goldberg I.J. Breslow J.L.

By using a variety of different treatments to modulate intracellular ceramide levels in either C2C12 myotubes or 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, we have shown that artificially increasing intracellular ceramide 2-fold over basal values blocks activation of Akt/PKB by insulin (8Chavez J.A. Summers S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 9Chavez J.A. Knotts T.A. Wang L.P. Li G. Dobrowsky R.T. Florant G.L. Summers S.A. J. Biol.

J. 2001; 354: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interestingly in our prior studies we have detected no effects of either induced endogenous ceramide or short-chain ceramide analogs on upstream signaling events, such as the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins or the activation of PI 3-kinase (8Chavez J.A. Summers S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 10Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we sought to understand the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of ceramide by defining the region of Akt/PKB that confers responsiveness to ceramide. Specifically we evaluated effects of ceramide analogs on truncated constructs encoding either (a) the isolated PH domain, which translocates to the plasma membrane following insulin treatment, or (b) the isolated catalytic/regulatory domain, which is phosphorylated and activated in response to insulin via a translocation-independent mechanism. Surprisingly the findings obtained revealed the existence of two independent mechanisms by which ceramide regulates Akt/PKB, each initiated downstream of PI 3-kinase and culminating on a separate domain of Akt/PKB. Antibodies and Reagents—Polyclonal antibodies directed against the phosphorylated forms of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt/PKB (Ser-473 site) were from Promega (Madison, WI) and Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA), respectively, and those against hemagglutinin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to Texas Red or horseradish peroxidase were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA) or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. C2-ceramide and C2-dihydroceramide were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Porcine insulin was from Sigma. PI(3,4,5)P3 was from Echelon Biosciences (Salt Lake City, UT). Cell Culture—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Preadipocytes expressing the Akt/PKB constructs were periodically selected in 800 μg/ml G418 and were described previously (23Summers S.A. Whiteman E.L. Cho H. Lipfert L. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23858-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cell Lines and cDNA Constructs—3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing HA-tagged human Akt1/PKBα (HA-Akt/PKB) or Δ4–129-Akt/PKB (Cat/Reg-Akt/PKB) were provided by Richard Roth (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and were described previously (24Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Sandra Watton and Doreen Cantrell (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK) provided the PH domain of Akt/PKB coupled to green fluorescent protein (GFP) (25Watton S.J. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 433-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). HA-tagged PDK1 was described previously (26Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Riojas R.A. Ramos F.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40400-40406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The GFP-tagged catalytic domain of Akt/PKB (amino acids 126–480) was generated by PCR using a forward primer (GGGAGATCTAGTGACAACTCAGGGGCTGAAG), which inserted a BglII restriction site, and a reverse primer 3′ primer (GGGGAATTCTCAGGCTGTCGGACTGGC), which inserted an EcoRI restriction site after the stop codon. The PCR fragment was obtained using full-length GFP-Akt as a template, and the PCR product obtained was cloned into the pGEM TA cloning vector (Promega), digested with BglII and EcoRI, and subcloned into the pEGFP vector (Clontech). Analysis of Akt/PKB Translocation by Confocal Microscopy—3T3-L1 preadipocytes at 20–30% confluency on coverslips were transfected with 10 μg of cDNA encoding GFP-Akt-PH, GFP-Cat/Reg-Akt/PKB, or HA-PDK1 using the LipoTAXI mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cells were analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy 48 h post-transfection. Digital image processing was performed as described previously using Metamorph software (22Stratford S. DeWald D.B. Summers S.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). GFP-tagged proteins were visualized directly, while HA-tagged ones were visualized by immunofluorescence with anti-HA antibodies using methods described previously (27Summers S.A. Kao A.W. Kohn A.D.

PI 3-Kinase Assays—PI 3-kinase assays were performed using the method of Wang and Summers (28Wang L.P. Summers S.A. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 83: 127-136PubMed Google Scholar). Delivery of PI(3,4,5)P3—PI(3,4,5)P3 was delivered using the Shuttle PIP™ kit from Echelon Biosciences. Briefly 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown to confluency and serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h prior to treatment. Equimolar concentrations of PI(3,4,5)P3 and histone carrier were mixed, sonicated, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The mixture was added to cells at a final concentration of 1 μm for 10 min prior to lysis. For selected assays, NBD-labeled PI(3,4,5)P3 was included and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Immunoblot Analyses of Total Cell Lysates—Cells grown to confluency in 100-mm-diameter dishes were serum-deprived as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of 66 mm Tris (pH 8.0) containing 2% SDS and 100 mm vanadate. Samples were boiled for 2 min, and DNA was sheared by passing extracts through a 27-gauge needle several times. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifuging the samples for 30 min at 20,000 × g. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic protein assay kit from Pierce, and 40 μg of total protein were loaded into each well of a 7.5% or 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with the indicated antibodies as described previously (29Summers S.A. Lipfert L. Birnbaum Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Antibody detection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersham Biosciences. PDK1 Kinase Assay—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown to 50% confluency and transfected with pBEX-PDK1 using calcium phosphate. Cells were serum-deprived in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h and treated with or without insulin and/or C2-ceramide. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2% Igepal, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 IU/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin), incubated on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged for 10 min. The supernatant (900 μl) was transferred to new tubes and rocked with 8 μl of rabbit anti-HA antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Thirty microliters of Protein A-agarose beads were washed in lysis buffer, centrifuged, and incubated with the supernatant for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were then washed three times with lysis buffer, twice more with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol), and resuspended in kinase buffer. Sphingosine (1 mm) and C2-ceramide (1 mm) were prepared as stock solutions in kinase buffer containing 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and were added at a final concentration of 100 μm.[32P]ATP (5 μCi) was added to each sample in 200 μm ATP + Mg2+. The final volume for the reaction was 50 μl. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized on a Storm PhosphorImager. Ceramide Blocks the Effects of Insulin on Both the PH Domain and the Catalytic/Regulatory Domain of Akt/PKB—Akt/PKB is comprised of an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain followed by a carboxyl-terminal catalytic/regulatory domain (31Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.I. Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Golemis E.A. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As described earlier, Akt/PKB translocates to the plasma membrane in insulin-stimulated cells because of high affinity interactions between its PH domain and insulin-generated 3′-phosphoinositides (32Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The 3′-phosphoinositides displace the PH domain of Akt/PKB, exposing two regulatory phosphorylation sites within the catalytic/regulatory domain (17Whiteman E.L. Cho H. Birnbaum M.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 444-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). To determine whether ceramide blocked the insulin-stimulated recruitment of Akt/PKB to the plasma membrane, we assessed the effects of a short-chain ceramide analog (C2-ceramide) on the subcellular distribution of Akt/PKB constructs tagged with GFP. Within minutes, insulin stimulated the translocation of either a full-length Akt/PKB construct (wild type, WT-Akt/PKB) or a truncated one encoding only the PH domain (PH-Akt/PKB). Pretreating with C2-ceramide completely blocked this insulin-stimulated movement of either construct (Fig. 1). Removal of the PH domain (Cat/Reg-Akt/PKB) rendered Akt/PKB incapable of translocating to the plasma membrane, and its subcellular distribution was unaltered by C2-ceramide (Fig. 1). Interestingly Roth and colleagues (33Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously that, through a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism, insulin activates Cat/Reg-Akt/PKB by stimulating its phosphorylation on two sites. Presumably removal of the PH domain eliminates the need for membrane localization as the domain no longer blocks accessibility to the regulatory residues. However, activation of the enzyme still requires PI 3-kinase as Ser-473 phosphorylation occurs through a separable PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway (18Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 19Scheid M.P. Marignani P.A. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6247-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Reasoning that this construct would be insensitive to the inhibitory effects of ceramide, we determined whether C2-ceramide blocked the phosphorylation and activation of Cat/Reg-Akt/PKB. Surprisingly C2-ceramide completely inhibited the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation and activation of Cat/Reg-Akt/PKB (Fig. 2). Specifically we were able to simultaneously assess the phosphorylation state of both endogenous Akt/PKB and Cat/Reg-Akt/PKB in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing the deletion construct. Using antibodies that recognize the Ser-473 phosphorylation site, we found that C2-ceramide blocks phosphorylation of both endogenous Akt/PKB and Cat/Reg-Akt/PKB comparably (Fig. 2A). We additionally measured the kinase activity of the immunoisolated Cat/Reg-Akt/PKB construct and found that ceramide completely ablated the insulin-stimulated increase in enzymatic activity (Fig. 2B). Ceramide Does Not Inhibit Upstream Signaling Events—The observation that ceramide inhibits distinct domains on Akt/PKB suggested that the effects of sphingolipid were the result of an inhibition of upstream signaling events. Moreover researchers have used labeled PH domains as a means of measuring 3-phosphoinositide generation in vivo (34Whiteman E.L. Chen J.J. Birnbaum M.J.

Although others and we have demonstrated that C2-ceramide has no effect on PI 3-kinase in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts or 3T3-L1 adipocytes (9Chavez J.A. Knotts T.A. Wang L.P. Li G. Dobrowsky R.T.

Hemi R. Papa M.Z. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9895-9897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 40Zundel W. Giaccia A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13018-13022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To confirm that the effects of C2-ceramide did not result from its inhibition of PI 3-kinase we evaluated whether C2-ceramide blocked activation of Akt/PKB triggered by directly introducing PI(3,4,5)P3 into intracellular domains. Specifically, Shuttle PIP carriers (Echelon Biosciences) were used to deliver PI(3,4,5)P3 into living 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Fig. 3A demonstrates the subcellular localization of NBD-labeled PI(3,4,5)P3, which did not appear in either the nucleus or plasma membrane but instead localized to large structures present throughout the interior of the cell (Fig. 3A). At concentrations as low as 1 μm, PI(3,4,5)P3 stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB (Fig. 3B). Interestingly PI(3,4,5)P3 also stimulated the phosphorylation of Cat/Reg-Akt/PKB, confirming the existence of a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway responsible for Akt/PKB phosphorylation that is independent of the effect on Akt/PKB translocation (42Scheid M.P. Lauener R.W. Duronio V. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). C2-ceramide completely blocked Akt/PKB phosphorylation induced by PI(3,4,5)P3, confirming that C2-ceramide regulates Akt/PKB independently of effects on PI 3-kinase. An alternative possibility was that C2-ceramide was promoting 3′-phosphoinositide degradation or altering the ability of 3′-phosphoinositide to effectively signal to all of its target molecules. To confirm that 3′-phosphoinositides were capable of signaling to downstream effectors other than Akt/PKB, we determined whether C2-ceramide altered the translocation of another target of 3′-phosphoinositides, PDK1. To effectively remove PDK1 from the plasma membrane, we treated cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 ∼16 h before performing the experiment. This treatment effected a redistribution of GFP-tagged PDK1 from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. The addition of insulin rapidly stimulated the translocation of PDK1 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4) via a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism (data not shown). C2-ceramide, under conditions that completely blocked Akt/PKB phosphorylation, activation, and translocation, had no effect on the movement of PDK1 (Fig. 4). These data indicate that PI(3,4,5)P3 is produced and functional in these cells, but it is incapable of recruiting and activating Akt/PKB in cells loaded with excess ceramide. Surprisingly Filippa et al. (43Filippa N. Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported that the catalytic/regulatory domain of Akt/PKB can interact directly with PDK1, thus negating the need for 3′-phosphoinositides in its translocation. In this prior study, catalytically inactive forms of PDK1, as well as those lacking their PH domains, were incapable of promoting Akt/PKB translocation. Although we were unable to detect any movement of Cat/Reg-Akt to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1), we nonetheless evaluated the effects of ceramide on PDK1 kinase activity as the inhibition of PDK1 activity could account for the effects on Cat/Reg-Akt phosphorylation and activation. C2-ceramide, at concentrations as high as 100 μm, had no effect on the activity of immunoisolated PDK1 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly King et al. (44King C.C. Zenke F.T. Dawson P.E. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Hemmings B.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18108-18113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) found that sphingosine dramatically stimulates PDK1 activity and have hypothesized that this is important for PDK1 activation by hormonal stimuli. Since C2-ceramide contains a sphingosine backbone, we hypothesized that C2-ceramide might block the sphingosine-induced increase in PDK1 activity. However, although sphingosine potently activated"

In a third form of DNA repair–deficient TTD, called group A, none of the nine subunits encoding TFIIH carried mutations; instead, the steady-state level of the entire complex was severely reduced1. A new, tenth TFIIH subunit (TFB5) was recently identified in yeast2. Here, we describe the identification of the human TFB5 ortholog and its association with human TFIIH. Microinjection of cDNA encoding TFB5 (GTF2H5, also called TTDA) corrected the DNA-repair defect of TTD-A cells, and we identified three functional inactivating mutations in this gene in three unrelated families with TTD-A. The GTF2H5 gene product has a role in regulating the level of TFIIH. The identification of a new evolutionarily conserved subunit of TFIIH implicated in TTD-A provides insight into TFIIH function in transcription, DNA repair and human disease."

The molecular system is composed of two types of helical peptides that carry different chromophores and have different directions of dipole moments when they are immobilized on gold. The mixed, self-assembled monolayer generated an anodic photocurrent when one of the two chromophores was photoexcited, whereas the photocurrent switched to being cathodic when the other chromophore was photoexcited. The opposite current response arises from the dipole moment of each helical peptide, which accelerates electron transfer in the same direction."
https://openalex.org/W1989753542,"At the silent mating-type interval of fission yeast, the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery cooperates with cenH , a DNA element homologous to centromeric repeats, to initiate heterochromatin formation. However, in RNAi mutants, heterochromatin assembly can still occur at low efficiency. Here, we report that Atf1 and Pcr1, two ATF/CREB family proteins, act in a parallel mechanism to the RNAi pathway for heterochromatin nucleation. Deletion of atf1 or pcr1 alone has little effect on silencing at the mating-type region, but when combined with RNAi mutants, double mutants fail to nucleate heterochromatin assembly. Moreover, deletion of atf1 or pcr1 in combination with cenH deletion causes loss of silencing and heterochromatin formation. Furthermore, Atf1 and Pcr1 bind to the mating-type region and target histone H3 lysine-9 methylation and the Swi6 protein essential for heterochromatin assembly. These analyses link ATF/CREB family proteins, involved in cellular response to environmental stresses, to nucleation of constitutive heterochromatin."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry; LCM, laser capture microdissection; Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; APP, Aβ precursor protein. is a devastating neurological disorder that impairs cognitive function and disturbs emotion and personality. Histopathologically, AD is manifested by the extracellular aggregation of amyloid plaques and the intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. Although current amyloid cascade hypothesis (1Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11025) Google Scholar) or tau hypothesis (2Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar) provides a framework for studying AD pathogenesis, the detailed molecular mechanisms that translate amyloid or tau accumulation into neuronal damage and functional brain impairments are largely unknown. In addition, there are numerous, complex pathological changes in AD brain that contribute to neuronal and synaptic degeneration, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, and inflammation (3Blass J.P.

Aging. 2000; 21: 383-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (3705) Google Scholar). The first major breakthrough in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of AD came from the biochemical purification of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) from senile plaques, as described by Glenner and Wong (6Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar), and the subsequent sequencing and identification of the Aβ precursor protein (APP) gene. Although the major insoluble component of plaques has been identified as Aβ (6Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar, 7Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar), the entire molecular composition of the plaques is not known. The plaques are highly complex structures with a variety of neural and glial elements (8Terry R.D. Gonatas N.K. Weiss M. Am. J. Pathol. 1964; 44: 269-297PubMed Google Scholar), and many proteins have been localized to these structures by immunohistochemistry. However, biochemical verification of the plaque components has been scarce. Moreover, biochemical approaches previously applied to purify plaque components generally use very stringent extraction conditions (e.g. high concentration of salt, urea, and/or protease treatment) that may remove Aβ-associated proteins. The identities and roles of other plaque proteins that may act synergistically or competitively with Aβ in aggregation and deposition are also incomplete. A systematic analysis of plaque proteins should shed light on the underlying molecular processes that govern the plaque formation. Traditionally, proteomic analysis is performed by comparing samples between AD cases and normal controls in two-dimensional gels and identifying proteins of interest by mass spectrometry (9Butterfield D.A. Boyd-Kimball D. Castegna A. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1313-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Several groups (10Tsuji T. Shiozaki A. Kohno R. Yoshizato K. Shimohama S. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11Schonberger S.J. Edgar P.F. Kydd R. Faull R.L. Cooper G.J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have tried this strategy and identified some proteins that are altered in the expression levels. However, the two-dimensional gel method is generally incompatible with proteins of extreme size, pI, and/or hydrophobicity, and it is tedious to determine the identity of hundreds of protein spots displayed on a two-dimensional gel. Many of the limitations can be overcome by the development of liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (12Aebersold R. Mann M. Nature. 2003; 422: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (5602) Google Scholar, 13Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4091) Google Scholar). It is now possible to analyze hundreds to thousands of proteins directly from a complex protein mixture, and the sensitivity can reach low femtomole and even subfemtomole levels. The power of shotgun LC-MS/MS-based proteomics technology has been documented by successful proteomic analysis of subcellular structures in mammalian cells, such as nucleolus (14Andersen J.S.

The methodology has also been used to address dynamic changes in protein levels under specific conditions, as exemplified by the identification of protein components in the epidermal growth factor signaling pathway (19Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Ong S.E. Nielsen M. Foster L.J. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and the functional investigation of the myc oncogene (20Shiio Y. Donohoe S. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5088-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry has also greatly simplified the analysis of post-translational modifications (21Mann M. Jensen O.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar, 22Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Whereas it may be problematic to isolate plaques to homogeneity by using traditional biochemical methods, the advent of laser capture microdissection (LCM) allows procuring a microscopic region as small as 3-5 μm in diameter (23Simone N.L. Bonner R.F. Gillespie J.W. Emmert-Buck M.R. Liotta L.A. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 272-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The LCM technology has been used extensively to collect homogeneous cell types for DNA mutation detection and gene expression analysis at the mRNA level (23Simone N.L. Bonner R.F. Gillespie J.W.

More recently, its application in proteomics has begun to be appreciated (24Zhou G. Li H. DeCamp D. Chen S. Shu H. Gong Y. Flaig M. Gillespie J.W. Hu N. Taylor P.R. Emmert-Buck M.R. Liotta L.A.

Petricoin III, E.F. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It is possible to use LCM to capture neuropathological structures with high purity, but the amount of samples collected by LCM is often limited, complicating proteomic analysis by two-dimensional gel-based methods. These limitations can be alleviated by the integration of LCM with the highly sensitive LC-MS/MS technology. Here we present the isolation of postmortem amyloid plaques labeled with thioflavin-S by using the LCM approach and the systematic identification of extracted proteins by LC-MS/MS. The entire procedure was performed twice with samples from two AD cases. Together, more than 480 proteins were detected in the plaque samples, and 26 proteins were shown to be enriched in the plaques in comparison with the surrounding tissue. The presence of selected proteins in the plaques was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, and cytoplasmic dynein was found to be a novel component of amyloid plaques in human specimens and in an AD mouse model. These studies demonstrate a powerful new approach for achieving comprehensive analysis of the sub-proteome of neuropathological structures. Brain Sections—Small blocks of fresh frontal and temporal cortex were obtained at autopsy from a 55-year-old Caucasian female (postmortem interval, 4.5 h, case 1) and a 78-year-old Caucasian male (postmortem interval, 17.5 h, case 2). Both cases were neuropathologically diagnosed as definite AD according to CERAD criteria (26Mirra S.S. Heyman A. McKeel D. Sumi S.M. Crain B.J. Brownlee L.M. Vogel F.S. Hughes J.P. van Belle G. Berg L. Neurology. 1991; 41: 479-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The brain blocks were embedded in Tissue-Tek® OCT Compound (Jed Pella Inc., Redding, CA), frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80 °C. 10-μm-thick brain sections were cut by using a Leica CM 3050 cryostat (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL) and mounted on uncoated and uncharged glass slides. Laser Capture Microdissection—Isolation of plaques by LCM was performed based on the protocol developed previously (27Emmert-Buck M.R. Bonner R.F. Smith P.D. Chuaqui R.F. Zhuang Z. Goldstein S.R. Weiss R.A. Liotta L.A. Science. 1996; 274: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (2142) Google Scholar). The frozen brain sections were thawed at room temperature, fixed with 75% ethanol for 1 min, stained with 1% thioflavin-S for 1 min, differentiated in 75% ethanol for 1 min, and then subjected to dehydration in a series of graded ethanol. Finally, the slides were cleared in xylene for 5 min and then air-dried and desiccated. LCM was performed the same day under a fluorescence microscope attached to a Pixcell II laser capture facility (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA) with the following settings: excitation wavelength, 495 nm; laser power, 60-80 milliwatts; duration, 1 ms; and laser spot size, 7.5 μm. A total of about 2000 amyloid plaques were procured from four cortical sections in both cases. Non-plaque areas surrounding the plaques were captured as a control. Each CapSure Macro LCM cap (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA) was used for the capture of about 500 plaques or control tissues from one slide. Protein Extraction and Analysis by Mass Spectrometry—The caps were extracted twice with lysis buffer at 65 °C for 15 min. The lysis buffer was made from phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.2, with the addition of 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After the extraction, the samples were alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The total amount of proteins in the samples was estimated on a silver-stained SDS gel according to a standard protein marker with known concentration. For mass spectrometry analysis, proteins in each sample were separated on a 6-12% SDS gel (0.75 mm thick) and stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. The entire lane was cut into 15 pieces followed by in-gel trypsin digestion (28Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides from each gel piece were dissolved in buffer A (0.4% acetic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid, 5% acetonitrile). A pressure cell was used to load each sample onto a 50-μm inner diameter × 12-cm self-packed, fused silica C18 capillary column as described (29Peng J. Gygi S.P. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Peptides were eluted during a 2-h gradient from 10 to 30% buffer B (0.4% acetic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid, 95% acetonitrile; flow rate, ∼300 nl/min). Eluted peptides were ionized under high voltage (1.8-2 kV) and detected in an MS survey scan from 400 to 1700 atomic mass units with 2 microscans followed by three data-dependent MS/MS scans (3 microscans each, isolation width 3 atomic mass units, 35% normalized collision energy, dynamic range 3 min) in a completely automated fashion on an LCQ-DECA XP-Plus ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Database Searching for Protein Identification—The Sequest algorithm (30Eng J. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5444) Google Scholar) was utilized for searching all MS/MS spectra against the human reference data base (ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank, July, 2003). The parameters were set to allow parent ion mass tolerance to be three and to consider only the b and y ion series. Modifications were permitted to allow the detection of the following (mass shift shown in daltons): oxidized methionine (+16), carboxymethylated cysteine (+57), and phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine (+80). We used more stringent Sequest criteria than described previously (31Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates III, J.R. Nat.

To reduce false-positives further, we manually verified proteins matched by less than three peptides, because no false-positives were found among proteins identified by at least three distinct peptides (32Peng J. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Therefore, all peptides were accepted with high confidence. The conversion from the identified peptides to proteins was complicated by the presence of different names for the same protein and/or by the sharing of peptides within several proteins (e.g. protein paralogs) (33Rappsilber J. Mann M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 74-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus we manually verified all proteins and removed the redundancy. Typically, we accepted proteins identified by at least one “unique peptide.” Obvious contaminants such as trypsin and keratins were removed. Finally we merged the data sets of the plaque samples from two independent experiments. Protein Quantification by Mass Spectrometry—Quantitative protein comparison between the plaques and the non-plaque control was carried out in two steps. The first step was based on the number of peptides identified for an assigned protein, indicative of protein abundance. We discarded proteins that were identified by more peptides in the control than in the plaques from either AD case. The second step was based on extracted ion current of corresponding peptides in MS survey scans (15Andersen J.S. Wilkinson C.J. Mayor T. Mortensen P. Nigg E.A. Mann M. Nature. 2003; 426: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 34Wang W. Zhou H. Lin H. Roy S. Shaler T.A. Hill L.R. Norton S. Kumar P. Anderle M. Becker C.H. Anal.

The ratio of peak intensities of selected peptides was measured in the 15 pairs of peptide mixtures that were generated by in-gel digestion of the 15 pairs of gel pieces as shown (Fig. 1). We analyzed each pair of samples in two consecutive LC-MS/MS runs on the same column and found that the quantitative variation was within 2-fold in general by using a trypsin auto-cleavage peptide (VATVSLPR, m/z 842.5 for singly charged ion) as internal control. Therefore, we used 2-fold as the threshold for protein enrichment in the plaques. The trypsin auto-cleavage peptide was also used to normalize the measured peptide ratios and to normalize the elution time of selected peptides between the pair of LC-MS/MS analyses. It should be mentioned that, in contrast to the peptide identification that was primarily derived from its MS/MS spectrum (Fig. 3B), the peptide quantification relied on the MS survey scan (Fig. 3A). An MS survey scan allowed the detection of many peptide ion peaks, of which only the most three predominant were selected for sequencing by MS/MS analysis. However, the other nonsequenced peaks on MS survey scans could be useful for quantification. For example, when a peptide was sequenced by MS/MS analysis in the plaque sample but not sequenced in the control, it is still possible to find and quantify the peptide ion in MS survey scans of the control sample according to its predicted m/z value and adjusted elution time. Otherwise, if the peptide could not be reliably located in the control sample, we estimated that the plaque/control ratio was more than 2-fold. Finally, we accepted proteins that were found to be enriched at least 2-fold in both AD cases.Fig. 3Identification and quantification of Aβ by reverse-phase LC-MS/MS.A, comparison of MS survey scans shows that a peptide ion with m/z 663.8 is much more abundant in the plaques (lower panel) than in the non-plaque control (upper panel). A partial region (620-700 m/z) is shown for simplicity, although the entire scan range is from 400 to 1700 m/z. B, MS/MS scan of the precursor ion (663.8 m/z), which led to the identification of a tryptic peptide derived from Aβ. Gaps between the adjacent product ions fit the mass of amino acid residues as indicated. C, the elution profile of the Aβ tryptic peptide (m/z 663.4-666.4 due to naturally occurring isotopic distribution) from the non-plaque control and the plaque sample after normalizing the elution time. The peptide was quantified based on the extracted ion current. In fact, the data acquired in LC-MS/MS are three-dimensional (ion current indicated by the relative abundance, retention time of LC, and the m/z measurement every ∼2 s during the entire LC). A was a snapshot of m/z measurement at the retention time point of 65 min in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunohistochemistry—Nontransgenic and double transgenic C3/B6 mice expressing the APP695 isoform with the “Swedish” double mutation (APPswe) and PS1ΔEx9, a functional PS1 mutant lacking exon 9 (amino acids 290-319) (36Borchelt D.R.

Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (Abbott) and decapitated, and brains were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for up to 6 h. Sections of cingulate cortex from four patients with autopsy-confirmed AD and two normal controls were used. At autopsy, the brains were fixed with formalin for at least 48 h. Brain blocks were then sectioned (50 μm) with a freezing microtome (Microm, Heidelberg, Germany). The brain sections were cryoprotected in 40% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (50 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2). Double labeling was performed by using rabbit anti-Aβ (1:200, polyclonal antibody, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) together with one of the following monoclonal antibodies: anti-Hsp70/90 (1:200, Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) or anti-vimentin (1:2000, Roche Applied Science). For Aβ colocalization with rabbit anti-dynein heavy chain (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), a monoclonal antibody against Aβ (4G8, 1:200, Chemicon) was used. After primary antibody incubation overnight at 4 °C, the sections were extensively rinsed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Bar Harbor, ME) and then with biotinylated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at room temperature for 2 h. The biotinylated secondary antibody was further detected by avidin-biotin complex and Tyramide Signal Amplification (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The double-labeled sections were examined with a ×40 objective lens (numeric aperture 1.4) on a LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). Identification of Proteins Enriched in AD Amyloid Plaques by Quantitative Proteomics—Senile plaques in AD brain tissues were stained with thioflavin-S and isolated by using LCM (Fig. 1A). Despite some background staining on the postmortem tissue sections, the plaques were easily distinguishable under the microscope. Approximately 2,000 plaques from one AD brain were captured to yield ∼4 μg of total protein after extraction with SDS-containing lysis buffer. The non-plaque regions from the same brain sections were also procured as a control. The total protein samples extracted from the plaques and the non-plaque control were resolved in parallel on an SDS gel (Fig. 1B), which indicates a similar protein composition in the two samples. The proteins in the entire gel lanes were analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described under “Materials and Methods.” Approximately 30,000 MS/MS spectra were acquired for each sample and searched against a human protein database by using the Sequest program (30Eng J. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5444) Google Scholar). The matched peptides were further filtered rigorously and led to the identification of 331 proteins in the plaques and 327 proteins in the adjacent non-plaque regions of the cortex in this AD case (Fig. 2). As the plaques are complex and heterogeneous neuropathological structures and are expected to vary among human cases, the protein components may differ in AD patients. We repeated the entire proteomic analysis by using samples isolated from the second AD case and identified 413 proteins in the plaques and 384 proteins in its own non-plaque control (Fig. 2). The data sets from the two AD cases were combined to result in a list of 488 proteins detected in the plaque samples (supplemental Table S1). The current literature identifies about 53 proteins present in the plaques, of which 44 proteins were found in our large scale analyses (Table S1). As expected, many of these proteins were also found in the cortical areas without the plaques, because some normal cellular elements are components of the plaques, including glia and neurons. Alternatively, these proteins may reflect the capture of normal cellular elements along with the plaques. To determine which of the above proteins were enriched in the plaque regions, we utilized a strategy outlined in Fig. 2. First, only the 256 plaque proteins detected in both AD cases were considered to increase the dataset reliability. Although it is difficult to estimate protein abundance directly from its peptide ion current, the number of peptides identified for each protein is roughly correlated with the abundance of the protein after the protein size is normalized (38Sanders S.L. Jennings J. Canutescu A. Link A.J. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4723-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 39Rappsilber J. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. Mann M. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1231-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Based on this principle, we removed the proteins that were identified more frequently in the controls than in the plaques according to the corresponding peptide numbers (Fig. 2 and Table S1), and we kept the remaining 168 proteins for further quantitative analysis. More recently, several groups (15Andersen J.S. Wilkinson C.J. Mayor T. Mortensen P. Nigg E.A. Mann M. Nature. 2003; 426: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 34Wang W. Zhou H. Lin H.

Chem. 2003; 75: 6658-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) proposed a simple relative quantification method via extracted ion current of peptides in successive analyses. We used this method to quantify the 168 proteins by manual inspection of the raw files. For example, during the LC-MS/MS analysis, an Aβ tryptic peptide was detected in an MS survey scan (Fig. 3A) and sequenced by MS/MS (Fig. 3B) in the plaque sample and the control. The extracted ion current signal for the peptide is shown in Fig. 3C, which allows for peptide quantification in both samples. It is worth noting that a trypsin auto-cleavage peptide was used as an internal standard to normalize the experimental variation and to fit the elution time of selected peptides. The plaque/control ratio of Aβ abundance was determined to be around 80, indicative of the enormous enrichment of Aβ in the plaques. The relative abundance of all other proteins was quantified in a similar manner, resulting in the final acceptance of 26 proteins enriched at least 2-fold in the plaques of both AD cases (Table I). However, the majority of previously identified plaque proteins is not on this list because some abundant proteins (e.g. actin and tubulin, Table S1) are present but not necessarily concentrated in the plaque, and some low abundance proteins (e.g. collagen XXV and antichymotrysin, Table S1) were detected only in one AD case perhaps due to sensitivity limitation of the LC-MS/MS approach. Nevertheless, the list of 26 proteins that were identified and concentrated in the plaque regions in both AD cases are more likely to be genuine plaque proteins.Table IList of 26 proteins enriched in amyloid plaques as compared with non-plaque areasProtein nameGenBank™ accession no.AD case 1AD case 2CtlaCtl indicates the number of different p"
https://openalex.org/W1965265446,"We examined dendritic protein synthesis after a prolonged blockade of action potentials alone and after a blockade of both action potentials and miniature excitatory synaptic events (minis). Relative to controls, dendrites exposed to a prolonged blockade of action potentials showed diminished protein synthesis. Dendrites in which both action potentials and minis were blocked showed enhanced protein synthesis, suggesting that minis inhibit dendritic translation. When minis were acutely blocked or stimulated, an immediate increase or decrease, respectively, in dendritic translation was observed. Taken together, these results reveal a role for miniature synaptic events in the acute regulation of dendritic protein synthesis in neurons."

The increased oxidative damage in mitochondria induces the mitochondrial permeability transition resulting in apoptotic or necrotic cell death (2Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The selective mitigation of oxidative damage in mitochondria is therefore an effective therapeutic strategy in such age-related human disorders. However, a major limitation of antioxidant therapy in the treatment of mitochondrial diseases has been the inability to enhance antioxidant levels in mitochondria (13Murphy M.P. Smith R.A.J. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2000; 41: 235-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Recently, there was a breakthrough in mitochondrial targeting of antioxidants (14Murphy M.P. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 326-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Antioxidants were covalently coupled to a triphenylphosphonium cation, and these compounds were preferentially taken up by mitochondria (13Murphy M.P. Smith R.A.J. Adv.

The lipophilic cations easily permeate through the lipid bilayers and subsequently accumulate several hundred-fold within mitochondria because of a large mitochondrial membrane potential (150–170 mV; negative inside). Mito-Q, a derivative of ubiquinone, and MitoVit-E, a derivative of Vit-E, are two promising antioxidants (Fig. 1) that are specifically targeted to mitochondria (17Matthews R.T. Yang L. Browne S. Baik M. Beal M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 18Lass A. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial ubiquinone is a respiratory chain component buried within the lipid core of the inner membrane where it accepts 2 electrons from complexes I or II forming the corresponding reduction product (i.e. ubiquinol) which then donates electrons to complex III (19Crane F.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The ubiquinone pool in vivo exists largely in the reduced ubiquinol form acting as an antioxidant and a mobile electron carrier. Ubiquinol has been reported to function as an antioxidant by donating a hydrogen atom from one of its hydroxyl groups to a lipid peroxyl radical, thereby decreasing lipid peroxidation within the mitochondrial inner membrane (20Kagan V.E. Serbinova E.A. Stoyanovsky D.A. Khwaja S. Packer L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Maguire J.J. Wilson D.S. Packer L. J. Biol.

The ubisemiquinone radical formed during this process disproportionates into ubiquinone and ubiquinol (23Ingold K.U. Bowry V.W. Stocker R. Walling C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 24Land E.J. Swallow A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1890-1894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The respiratory chain subsequently recycles ubiquinone back to ubiquinol, restoring its antioxidant function. Vitamin E (Vit-E) (or α-to-copherol) is another antioxidant within the mitochondrial inner membrane, and the tocopheroxyl radical formed from one-electron oxidation of Vit-E regenerates Vit-E by reacting with ubiquinol (18Lass A. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Maguire J.J. Wilson D.S. Packer L. J. Biol.

Previously, it was reported (26Atamna H. Robinson C. Ingersoll R. Ames B.N. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that N-tert-butyl hydroxylamine reversed age-related changes in mitochondria by undergoing redox cycling in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In this study, we tested the efficacy of two mitochondria-targeted antioxidants in preventing mitochondrial oxidative damage and apoptosis in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) treated with glucose/glucose oxidase and lipid hydroperoxide. Results suggest that mitochondria-targeted antioxidants are more effective inhibitors of mitochondrial damage and apoptosis than the corresponding “untargeted” counterparts (i.e. Vit-E). Glucose oxidase was obtained from Sigma. 13-Hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HpODE) and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was purchased from Molecular Probes. N-Carbobenzoxyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal (MG-132) was obtained from Biomol, and clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone (Lac) was purchased from Sigma. Mito-Q and MitoVit-E were synthesized as follows. MitoVit-E—The method of Murphy and co-workers (27Smith R.A.J. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Murphy M.P. Eur. J.

This chroman was converted to the corresponding nitrile which, upon hydrolysis with aqueous ethylene glycol in KOH, gave the corresponding acid. The acid was reduced to the alcohol that was converted to the bromo derivative by using carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in dimethyl formamide. The bromo derivative was heated with triphenylphosphine in dioxane for 10 days. The solid was separated and purified by repeated precipitation from a dichloromethane solution by addition of ether. The overall yield was about 25%. Mito-Q—Mitoquinone was synthesized according to the published method (15Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A.J. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4588-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Briefly, 11-bromoperoxyundecanoic acid prepared from 11-bromoundecanoic acid was coupled with 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone to yield the 6-(10-bromodecyl) ubiquinone. The quinone was reduced to the quinol using sodium borohydride and heated with triphenylphosphine in dioxane for 4 days. The oily product separated from the reaction medium was purified and analyzed by mass spectroscopy. Endothelial Cell Culture—The cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), insulin (10 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), glutamine (4 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were used between passages 4 and 12, as described by Balla et al. (28Balla G. Jacob H.S. Balla J. Rosenberg M. Nath K. Apple F. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the day of the treatment, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS. Mito-Q (1 μm) or MitoVit-E (1 μm) was added to the cells in the medium that contained 25 mm glucose as a substrate for glucose oxidase. Cell Viability—Intracellular conversion of MTT to formazan was used as an indicator of cell viability (λmax = 562 nm). After treatment with Glu/GO in the presence and absence of antioxidants, the culture media were removed, and the cells were washed three times with control salt solution (CSS) (120 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, and 15 mm glucose). Cells were incubated in CSS buffer containing 0.25 mg/ml MTT for 2 h at 37 °C. CSS buffer was removed, and cells were solubilized and mixed thoroughly in isopropyl alcohol, 0.08 n HCl (1:1) and the concentration of formazan measured optically as described previously (29Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45064) Google Scholar). Caspase Activity—After treatment with glucose/glucose oxidase (Glu/GO) and antioxidants, cells were washed twice with DPBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer (caspase-3 assay kit, Clontech). The caspase activities were measured as described previously (30Kotamraju S. Konorev E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33585-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with DPBS following treatment with the aforementioned antioxidants and then lysed with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm CHAPS and 5 mm dithiothreitol. After the cytosolic fraction was taken by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, the caspase activities were measured in the supernatant using DEVD-pNA (acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp para-nitroanilide), acetyl-LEHD-pNA, and acetyl-IETD-pNA as substrates. The absorbance at 405 nm of the released pNA was monitored in a spectrophotometer and quantitated by using pNA as standard. TUNEL Measurements—The terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used for microscopic detection of apoptosis (30Kotamraju S. Konorev E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33585-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This assay was based on labeling of 3′-free hydroxyl ends of the fragmented DNA with fluorescein-dUTP catalyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Procedures were followed according to the commercially available kit (ApoAlert) from Clontech. Apoptotic cells exhibit a strong nuclear green fluorescence that can be detected by using a standard fluorescein filter (520 nm). All cells stained with propidium iodide exhibit a strong red cytoplasmic fluorescence at 620 nm. The areas of apoptotic cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy equipped with rhodamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. Detection of Cytochrome c Release into Cytosol—The release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol was measured according to methods described previously (31Tampo Y. Kotamraju S. Chitambar C.R. Kalivendi S.V. Keszler A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32Heinloth A. Brune B. Fischer B. Galle J. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 162: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAEC were washed with DPBS and homogenized in PBS supplemented with 40 μg/ml saponin. Lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction to measure the released cytochrome c into the cytosol by Western blot analysis using a mouse anti-cytochrome c antibody (Pharmingen). Detection was by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody using the ECL method. Aconitase Activity—BAECs were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed with a lysing buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 100 μm DTPA, and 5 mm citrate in PBS. The activity of aconitase in cell lysates was measured in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm dl-trisodium isocitrate. An extinction coefficient for cis-aconitate of 3.6 mm–1 at 240 nm was used (33Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complex I Activity—The complex I activity was measured as described previously (34Yen H.C. Oberley T.D. Gairola G. Szweda L. Calir D.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pelleted at 500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and resuspended in 2.5 ml of TES buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA and 10 mm triethanolamine acetate, pH 7.0) after treatment. Cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer with 15 strokes. Resulting material was transferred to a 2-ml tube and centrifuged at 1,500 × g. Postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to obtain a mitochondria-enriched pellet. The pellet was washed twice with 1 ml of homogenization buffer. The protein content of the pellet was assayed by the Bradford method. The mitochondrial pellet was subjected to “freeze-thawing” three times. Twenty microliters (0.3 mg of protein) of mitochondrial homogenate was mixed with 930 μl of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, in a 1-ml cuvette containing 50 μl of 100 μm NADH. The rate of NADH oxidation was monitored at 340 nm for 2 min in a UV spectrophotometer. Then 5 μlof 10 mm ubiquinone-1 was added, and the stimulated rate of NADH oxidation was measured as complex I activity, using an extinction coefficient of 6.81 mm–1 cm–1 at 340 nm. DCFH Staining—The determination of intracellular oxidant production is based on the oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) to a fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Following treatment of BAEC with Glu/GO and other targeted antioxidants, the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed twice with DPBS and incubated in 1 ml of medium without FBS. DCFH was added at a final concentration of 10 μm and incubated for 20 min. The cells were then washed once with DPBS and maintained in a 1-ml culture medium. The fluorescence was monitored after 30 min by using a Nikon fluorescence microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. Flow Cytometry—Following different treatments, BAECs were washed in PBS three times and incubated with DCFH-DA or Mitosensor reagent for 15 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence was measured using a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer with excitation and emission setting at 488 and 530 nm, respectively (35Senturker S. Tschirret-Guth R. Morrow J. Levine R. Shacter E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Glutathione Measurement—GSH levels were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography as the o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) adduct at pH 8.0 (36Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5488) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with PBS, suspended in 250 μl of PBS, and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min, 200 μl of the clear supernatant was derivatized by incubating with OPA for 30 min at room temperature. An aliquot of sample was injected into a column (Kramasil C-18) and eluted isocratically with a mobile phase consisting of 150 mm sodium acetate/methanol (91.5:8.5). The OPA-GSH adduct was monitored using a fluorescence detector operating at excitation and emission wavelengths at 250 and 410 nm, respectively. The levels of intracellular GSH were detected using a GSH solution as a standard. Measurement of 55Fe Uptake in Endothelial Cells—BAECs were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS until confluence. On the day of treatment the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS, and the cells were allowed to adjust to the medium conditions. 0.2 μCi of 55Fe (as ferric chloride) was added to the medium, and its levels were measured after 4 h. Cells were washed with DPBS and lysed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and the radioactivity was counted in a beta counter (37Chitambar C.R. Seligman P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 78: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38Kotamraju S. Chitambar C.R. Kalivendi S.V. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17179-17187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Measurement of55Fe Uptake into Mitochondria of Endothelial Cells—BAECs were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS until confluence. On the day of treatment the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS, and the cells were allowed to adjust to the medium conditions. 0.2 μCi of 55Fe (ferric chloride) was added to the medium. Following treatment, cells were washed twice with an isolation medium (320 mm sucrose, 1 mm potassium EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The cells were then scraped by using 1 ml of isolation medium and spun at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in a 4-ml isolation medium and spun at 1500 × g. The supernatants were combined and spun at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was spun at 17,000 × g for 11 min at 4 °C. Final pellets were resuspended in a 200 μl of isolation medium. An aliquot was taken for protein estimation, and the remaining suspension was used for counting in a beta counter. Detection of Transferrin Receptor Levels—BAECs were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 100 μl of RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium fluoride). To a 10-ml solution of the above, the following agents were added: 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin inhibitors. Cells were homogenized by passing the suspension through a 25-gauge needle (15 strokes). The lysate was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g. Protein was determined by the Bradford method, and 20 μg were used for the Western blot analysis. Proteins were resolved on polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membrane was washed twice with TBST (140 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) containing 0.1% Tween 20 before blocking the nonspecific binding with TBS containing 5% skim milk. Membrane was incubated with mouse anti-human transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml in TBS) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and 2% skim milk for 2 h at room temperature. Membrane was washed 5 times and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The bands were detected by using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential Changes— BAECs were treated in 6-well plates with Glu/GO with or without the targeted antioxidants. After treatment the cells were washed with serum-free media and incubated with the BD MitoSensor dye (Clontech) and incubated for 20 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. This dye is sensitive to changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential changes. The fluorescence was monitored by using a fluorescein isothiocyanate and a rhodamine filter. Proteasome Activity—26 S proteasome. Proteasomal activity was measured as reported earlier (39Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 40Pajonk F. Riess K. Sommer A. Mc Bride W.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAECs were washed with buffer I (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP) and homogenized with buffer I containing 250 mm sucrose. Twenty micrograms of 10,000 × g supernatant were diluted with buffer I to a final volume of 1 ml. The fluorogenic proteasome substrates N-succinyl-LLVY-AMC (chymotrypsin-like) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Lys-amino-4-methylcoumarin (trypsin-like) were added in a final concentration of 100 and 80 μm, respectively. Proteolytic activity was measured by monitoring the release of the fluorescent group 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (excitation 380 nm, emission 460 nm). Measurements of Cell Viability—BAECs were incubated with Glu/GO for various times with or without Mito-Q (1 μm) and MitoVit-E (1 μm), and the cell viability was estimated by using the MTT assay. Glu/GO decreased the cell viability to 18% which was restored to 64 and 51%, respectively, in the presence of Mito-Q and MitoVit-E. Similar results with HpODE were observed, where treatment with Mito-Q and MitoVit-E restored the cell viability to 59 and 48%, respectively (data not shown). Mitochondria-targeted Antioxidants Inhibit Apoptosis in BAEC Treated with Hydroperoxides—BAECs were incubated with Glu/GO (generator of H2O2) or 13-HpODE (lipoxygenase-catalyzed oxidative metabolite of linoleic acid) for different times, and caspase-3, -9, and -8 activities were measured (Figs. 2 and 3). The caspase-3 and -9 activities were markedly elevated after a 4-h treatment in Glu/GO-treated cells (Fig. 2, A–D). Unlike caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities, the caspase-8 activity increased only slightly in Glu/GO-treated cells (Fig. 2E). This is consistent with an intrinsic pathway involving mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Exposure of BAEC to Glu/GO increased the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 2F). Pretreatment with mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, Mito-Q and MitoVit-E, inhibited the caspase-3 and caspase-9 proteolytic activation induced by Glu/GO. As shown in Fig. 2, A and C, Mito-Q-pretreated cells were markedly resistant to H2O2-induced caspase activation. Pretreatment with MitoVit-E also inhibited H2O2-mediated caspase activa"

The mammalian enzymes that synthesize fatty alcohols have not been identified. Here, an in silico approach was used to discern two putative reductase enzymes designated FAR1 and FAR2. Expression studies in intact cells showed that FAR1 and FAR2 cDNAs encoded isozymes that reduced fatty acids to fatty alcohols. Fatty acyl-CoA esters were the substrate of FAR1, and the enzyme required NADPH as a cofactor. FAR1 preferred saturated and unsaturated fatty acids of 16 or 18 carbons as substrates, whereas FAR2 preferred saturated fatty acids of 16 or 18 carbons. Confocal light microscopy indicated that FAR1 and FAR2 were localized in the peroxisome. The FAR1 mRNA was detected in many mouse tissues with the highest level found in the preputial gland, a modified sebaceous gland. The FAR2 mRNA was more restricted in distribution and most abundant in the eyelid, which contains wax-laden meibomian glands. Both FAR mRNAs were present in the brain, a tissue rich in ether lipids. The data suggest that fatty alcohol synthesis in mammals is accomplished by two fatty acyl-CoA reductase isozymes that are expressed at high levels in tissues known to synthesize wax monoesters and ether lipids.

The data suggest that fatty alcohol synthesis in mammals is accomplished by two fatty acyl-CoA reductase isozymes that are expressed at high levels in tissues known to synthesize wax monoesters and ether lipids. Wax esters are abundant neutral lipids that coat the surfaces of plants, insects, and mammals. They are composed of long chain alcohols esterified to fatty acids and have the chemical property of being solid at room temperature and liquid at higher temperatures. Waxes play essential biological roles in preventing water loss, abrasion, and infection and are produced commercially at levels approaching 3 billion pounds per year for use in polishes, cosmetics, and packaging. In some mammals, wax esters constitute ∼30% of sebum and meibum, the oils secreted by the sebaceous and meibomian glands onto the surfaces of the skin and eye, respectively (1Downing D.T. Strauss J.S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1974; 62: 228-244Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Nikkari T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1974; 62: 257-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the enzymes of wax biosynthesis in mammals have not been isolated, the components of the pathway can be inferred from work in plants (3Jenks M.A. Eigenbrode S.D. Lemieux B. Somerville C.R. Meyerowitz E.M. The Arabidopsis Book. American Society of Plant Biologists, Rockville, MD2002Google Scholar, 4Kunst L. Samuels A.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 51-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) and mammalian tissue extracts (5Wykle R.L. Malone B. Snyder F. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 890-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated in Scheme 1, two catalytic steps are required to produce a wax monoester, including reduction of a fatty acid to a fatty alcohol and subsequently, the trans-esterification of the fatty alcohol to a fatty acid. The first step is catalyzed by the enzyme fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR), 1The abbreviations used are: FAR, fatty acyl-coenzyme A reductase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CT, threshold value; HEK 293, human embryonic kidney 293; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. which uses the reducing equivalents of NAD(P)H to convert a fatty acyl-CoA into a fatty alcohol and CoASH. cDNAs specifying fatty acyl-CoA reductases have been identified in the jojoba plant (6Metz J.G. Pollard M.R. Anderson L. Hayes T.R. Lassner M.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the silkworm moth (7Moto K. Yoshiga T. Yamamoto M. Takahashi S.

Selvaraj G. Plant J. 2002; 30: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and in a microorganism (9Reiser S. Somerville C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2969-2975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the biochemical properties and subcellular localizations of these enzymes have not been reported. Fatty alcohols have two metabolic fates in mammals: incorporation into ether lipids or incorporation into waxes. Ether lipids account for ∼20% of phospholipids in the human body and are synthesized in membranes by a pathway involving at least seven enzymes (10Nagan N. Zoeller R.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 199-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The second step of this pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme alkyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase, which exchanges an sn-1 fatty acid in ester linkage to dihydroxyacetone phosphate with a long chain fatty alcohol to form an alkyl ether intermediate. Once produced, ether lipids are precursors for platelet activating factor, for cannabinoid receptor ligands, and for essential membrane components in cells of the reproductive and nervous systems (10Nagan N. Zoeller R.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 199-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 11Munn N.J. Arnio E. Liu D. Zoeller R.A. Liscum L. J.

In the current study a bioinformatics approach was used to identify mouse (m) and human (h) cDNAs encoding two fatty acyl-CoA reductase isozymes designated FAR1 and FAR2. The biochemical properties and subcellular localizations of recombinant FAR enzymes expressed in cultured mammalian and insect cells were defined, and tissue distributions were delineated. An accompanying paper reports the isolation and characterization of a wax synthase enzyme that catalyzes the second step of the mammalian wax biosynthetic pathway (12Cheng J.B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37798-37807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics and cDNA Cloning—Fatty acyl-CoA reductase protein sequences from the jojoba plant (Simmondsia chinensis (6Metz J.G. Pollard M.R. Anderson L. Hayes T.R. Lassner M.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar)) and the silkworm moth (Bombyx mori (7Moto K. Yoshiga T. Yamamoto M. Takahashi S. Okano K. Ando T. Nakata T. Matsumoto S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) to identify potential mouse and human reductase sequences. Two proteins with ∼30% sequence identity to the plant and insect enzymes were identified, and cDNAs for each were obtained. A mouse fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 cDNA (mFAR1, IMAGE clone 3495305, GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number BC007178) in the pCMV·SPORT6 vector was obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (IRAV) (Invitrogen).

The cDNA insert in this plasmid was released by digestion with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and NotI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and extraction (QIAquik gel extraction kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and ligated into the pCMV6 vector (GenBank/EBI Data Bank accession number AF239250). A human fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 cDNA (hFAR1, GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number AY600449) in the pCMV6-XL6 vector was purchased from Origene Technologies (Rockville, MD). A human fatty acyl-CoA reductase 2 cDNA (hFAR2, IMAGE clone 4732586) in the pDNR-LIB vector was obtained from Invitrogen. The cDNA insert in this plasmid was released by digestion with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and XhoI and then treated with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates to generate blunt ends. The engineered hFAR2 cDNA insert (nucleotides 62-2235 of GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number BC022267) was purified by gel electrophoresis and extraction (QIAquik gel extraction kit) and ligated into the SmaI site of the pCMV6 vector. DNA sequence analysis confirmed the identity and structure of the hFAR2 cDNA. Construction of FLAG Epitope-tagged Expression Plasmids—An expression plasmid (pCMV·SPORT6-FLAG-mFAR1) encoding a FLAG epitope-tagged version of the mouse FAR1 protein was assembled as follows. The FAR1 cDNA was amplified from the pCMV·SPORT6-mFAR1 template described above by PCR using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GTACCTGTCGACCCACCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGAGACAAGTCTGGATGGTTTCAATCC-3′ and 5′-ATTATGCGGCCGCGGTCTTCAGTATCTCATAGTGCTG-3′. The DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes SalI and NotI and ligated into the pCMV·SPORT6 vector (Invitrogen). The mFAR1 encoded by the resulting plasmid has the FLAG epitope (amino acid sequence DYKDDDDK) at the amino terminus. An expression plasmid (pCMV·SPORT6-FLAG-mFAR2) encoding a FLAG epitope-tagged version of the mouse FAR2 protein was assembled as follows. The mFAR2 cDNA was amplified from the pCMV6-mFAR2 template described above by the PCR using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GTACCTGTCGACCCACCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGATGTCCATGATCGCAGCTTTCTAC-3′ and 5′-ATTATGCGGCCGCTGTTCTTAGACCTTGAGTGTGCTG-3′. The DNA product was digested with the restriction enzymes SalI and NotI and ligated into the pCMV·SPORT6 vector (Invitrogen). This engineering placed the FLAG epitope at the amino terminus of the encoded mouse FAR2 protein. Baculovirus Expression Vectors—A baculovirus recombinant donor plasmid with a mouse FAR1 cDNA in the pFastBAC HTC vector (Invitrogen) was constructed by amplifying the FAR1 cDNA insert in the vector pCMV·SPORT6-mFAR1 described above using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GCCTATGTCGACGGACAAGTCAGGATGGTTTCAATCC-3′ and 5′-ATTATGCGGCCGCGGTCTTCAGTATCTCATAGTGCTG-3′. The modified cDNA was digested with the restriction enzymes SalI and NotI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and QIAquik gel extraction, and ligated into pFastBAC HTC. A mouse FAR2 cDNA baculovirus recombinant donor plasmid was constructed by amplifying the cDNA from the pCMV6-mFAR2 plasmid using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GCCTATGTCGACGAACCATACAGGAACGGAGGAATC-3′ and 5′-ATTATGCGGCCGCGTATCTGAGGTTCCAGATGATGGG-3′. The resulting DNA product was digested with the restriction enzymes SalI and NotI and ligated into pFastBAC HTC. A baculovirus donor plasmid containing the mouse Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase cDNA (nucleotides 48-1053 of GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number BC018333) was constructed as follows. Hepatic cDNA was amplified via PCR using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CAGAAGCTTCAGATTCTTCTCTACG-3′ and 5′-TGTTCAGTATTCGTCATGAAATGGG-3′. The resulting cDNA product was ligated into the TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) and propagated in E. coli. The cDNA insert in this plasmid was excised by digestion with the restriction enzyme EcoRI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and the QIAquik gel extraction kit, and then ligated into the pFastBAC HTC vector. After construction of the donor plasmids, infectious Autographica californica nuclear polyhidrosis baculovirus stocks were generated and titrated in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system kit (Invitrogen). Preparation of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)-conjugated Fatty Acids—Capric acid (decanoic acid, C10:0), lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18: 1), linoleic acid (C18:2), homo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3), and arachidonic acid (C20:4) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 62 mm, and then precipitated by the addition of 5 m NaOH to a final concentration of 0.25 m. The ethanol was evaporated under a stream of N2 gas, and precipitated fatty acids were resuspended in 4 ml of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl by stirring and heating at 80 °C. An aliquot (4.16 ml) of 24% (w/v) BSA dissolved in H2O was added and the solution stirred at room temperature for 10 min. Thereafter, 0.9% NaCl was added to bring the total volume to 10 ml. The resulting stocks contained 5 mm fatty acid, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, and 10% (w/v) BSA. [1-14C]Palmitic acid and [1-14C]oleic acid dissolved in ethanol were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [1-14C]Capric acid, [1-14C]lauric acid, [1-14C]myristic acid, [1-14C]palmitic acid, [1-14C]stearic acid, [1-14C]linoleic acid, [1-14C]homo-γ-linolenic acid, and [1-14C]arachidonic acid dissolved in ethanol were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. An aliquot of radiolabeled fatty acid was dried under a stream of N2 gas and resuspended in the corresponding 5 mm solution of unlabeled fatty acid made as above to generate a stock containing 5 mm BSA-conjugated fatty acid and 0.36-0.4 mm 1-14C-labeled BSA-conjugated fatty acid. FAR Enzyme Assay in Transfected Cells—On day 0, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. On day 2, cells were transfected with 3.5 μg of a plasmid mixture containing 0.5 μg of pVA1 and 3 μg of pCMV·SPORT6-mFAR1, pCMV6-XL6-hFAR1, pCMV6-mFAR2, or pCMV6-hFAR2 expression plasmid using the FuGENE 6 reagent. Approximately 23 h after transfection, the cell medium was aspirated and replaced with 2.25 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 33.3 μm BSA-conjugated palmitic acid and 2.4 μm BSA-conjugated [1-14C]palmitic acid. After a further 24 h of incubation, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested with a rubber policeman into 2 ml of PBS, and utilized for thin layer chromatography (TLC) as described below. FAR Enzyme Assay in Baculovirus-infected Sf9 Cells—Sf9 cells were plated on day 0 at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/60-mm dish in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen). Approximately 4 h after plating, the medium was replaced with Sf-900 medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and the cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5-10 for 26 h. Thereafter, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of plating medium supplemented with 37.5 μm BSA-conjugated fatty acids and 2.7-3 μm BSA-conjugated 1-14C-labeled fatty acids, and the infected cells were returned to the incubator for an additional 28 h. The cells were washed with 2 ml of PBS and then scraped into 2 ml of PBS using a rubber policeman prior to analysis by TLC. TLC—Fatty acid metabolites in transfected or infected cells harvested into 2 ml of PBS were extracted into 8 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). The organic layer was dried under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipid residue was resuspended in 50 μl of hexane and spotted on prescored 150 Å silica gel plates (Whatman). Metabolites were resolved by chromatography in one of two solvent systems. Solvent system 1 involved development for 30 min in hexane:ether:formic acid (65:35:2, v/v/v). Solvent system 2 employed development for 30 min in hexane followed by drying of the plate in air for 15 min and a second development for 40 min in toluene. Radiolabeled metabolites on the plates were detected either by exposure to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak) or phosphorimaging using Fuji BAS-TR2040 screens (Fuji Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) and the Storm 820 imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Lipid standards were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., dissolved in ethanol (palmitic acid, stearic acid, hexadecanol, octadecanol, 1-oleoyl-racemic glycerol, (S)1,2-diolein, and glyceryl trioleate) or chloroform (dipalmitin and glyceryl tripalmitate) at final concentrations of 10 mm, and aliquots of 5 μl were chromatographed on the plates in lanes adjacent to those containing radiolabeled lipids. Standards were visualized by spraying the TLC plates with 0.1% (w/v) 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein in ethanol followed by examination under ultraviolet light (14Touchstone J.C. Practice of Thin Layer Chromotography. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). Preparation of Sf9 Cell Membranes—On day 0 of an experiment, Sf9 cells were inoculated at a density of 500,000 cells/ml in 120 ml of Sf-900 II SFM medium. On day 1, the cultures were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2-4 with the indicated recombinant baculovirus and cultured an additional 48 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C in a desktop centrifuge, and the cell pellets were washed once with 30 ml of PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, supplemented with one minicomplete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)/10 ml), incubated on ice for 10 min, and then lysed by passage through a 23-gauge needle 20 times. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a TLA120.2 rotor in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (both from Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). The membrane pellets were resuspended in assay buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors as described above). Assay of Cofactor Preference—FAR enzyme activity was measured in a volume of 500 μl of 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, one minicomplete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)/10 ml, 0.8 mg/ml BSA, 98 μm palmitoyl-CoA, 7 μm [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 2.5 mm β-NADPH or β-NADH. Aliquots (75 μg) of Sf9 cell membrane protein isolated from cells infected with either baculovirus expressing the steroid 5β-reductase or the mFAR1 enzyme were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 6 n HCl and 0.9 ml of PBS, and lipids were extracted into 6 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). TLC on dried and resuspended lipids was performed as described above. Assay of Palmitoyl-CoA versus Palmitic Acid Preference—These experiments were done as described under “Assay for Cofactor Preference” except that the reaction mixtures contained 2.5 mm β-NADPH and either 98 μm palmitoyl-CoA and 7 μm [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA (obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 2.9 μm BSA-conjugated [1-14C]palmitic acid and 40 μm BSA-conjugated palmitic acid with or without 1 mm ATP and 100 μm CoA. Aliquots (75 μg) of Sf9 cell membrane protein isolated from cells infected with either baculovirus expressing the steroid 5β-reductase or the mFAR1 enzyme were added to the mixture, and the tube was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 6 n HCl, and the lipids were separated by TLC as described above. Immunocytochemistry—On day 0 of an experiment, Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells in 6-well dishes containing 22-mm2 glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 (50:50 mix) medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (v/v), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. On day 1, cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA (pCMV6, pCMV·SPORT6-FLAG-mFAR1, or pCMV·SPORT6-FLAG-mFAR2) using FuGENE 6 reagent. After 18 h, cells were washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS and then fixed in methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then incubated in a blocking solution (PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma)) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (SKL rabbit polyclonal antibody (15Gould S.J. Krisans S. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) at 1:1,000 dilution and/or FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 1:2,500 dilution) for 8 h at 4 °C. The cells were then rinsed three times for 5 min each in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and/or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes)) both at 1:1,000 dilution in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA, twice with PBS, and then twice with deionized distilled H2O. The coverslips were mounted on a glass slide using a ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes) and then examined using a 63 × 1.3 NA PlanApo objective on a model 510 Laser Scanning Confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Göttingen, Germany). Real Time PCR—Total RNA was prepared from mouse tissues using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Aliquots (100 μg) of RNA were treated with deoxyribonuclease I (RNase-free, Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). cDNA synthesis was initiated from 2 μg of deoxyribonuclease I-treated RNA using random hexamer primers and Taqman reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). For each of the real time PCRs, which were carried out in triplicate, cDNA synthesized from 20 ng of deoxyribonuclease I-treated RNA was mixed with 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Samples were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System. Oligonucleotide primer sequences used in these experiments were: mFAR1 mRNA, 5′-TTAATGTTTATGCTCAAAACCTAGTGAAC-3′ and 5′-CCCCTTCCTACCCTTTGCA-3′, mFAR2 mRNA, 5′-CCCGACAAAACTAATTTAAACTCACTAA-3′ and 5′-GCTTGGTGCTGCCTTTCTCT-3′, and cyclophilin mRNA, 5′-TGGAGAGCACCAAGACAGACA-3′ and 5′-TGCCGGAGTCGACAATGAT-3′. The sequences of two eukaryotic fatty acyl-CoA reductase enzymes were used as probes of the mammalian data base. The first, from the jojoba plant S. chinensis (6Metz J.G. Pollard M.R. Anderson L. Hayes T.R. Lassner M.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), identified two mouse and human proteins with ∼30% sequence identity. The second fatty acyl-CoA reductase sequence was from the silkworm moth B. mori (7Moto K. Yoshiga T. Yamamoto M. Takahashi S. Okano K. Ando T. Nakata T. Matsumoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9156-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A search for orthologs of this insect enzyme in the mammalian data base revealed the same two mouse and human proteins as did searches with the plant enzyme sequence, again with low sequence identity. The fact that the plant, insect, mouse, and human sequences shared the same short regions of amino acid identity (Fig. 1) suggested that the mammalian enzymes were potential fatty acyl-CoA reductases. The two enzymes were tentatively named mouse and human fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 and 2 (FAR1 and FAR2). Comparisons between cDNA sequences and genomic DNA revealed that the mouse FAR1 enzyme was encoded by a gene on chromosome 7 F1 and contained at least 13 exons and 12 introns. The mouse FAR2 gene on chromosome 6 G3 contained at least 12 exons and 11 introns. The structures of the two genes were similar, both in overall size and in the positions of the introns, 10 of which interrupted the coding portions of the enzymes at the same positions (arrowheads, Fig. 1). Two introns in the FAR1 gene were located in the 5′-noncoding portion of the transcribed mRNA, and the FAR2 gene contained one intron in this region. The human FAR1 and FAR2 genes contained at least 12 exons and 11 introns and were present on autosomes (FAR1 = chromosome 11 p15.2; FAR2 = chromosome 12 p11.23). The amounts of FAR1 and FAR2 mRNAs were determined in different tissues of the mouse by real time PCR (Fig. 2). The FAR1 mRNA had the broadest distribution, being present at readily detectable levels (CT = 16.8-28) in the 20 tissues or cell lines examined (Fig. 2, top panel). The tissue with the highest level of FAR1 mRNA was the preputial gland (CT = 16.8), a specialized sebaceous gland located near the tail of the animal. In contrast to the FAR1 mRNA, the FAR2 mRNA was present at generally lower levels in a smaller number of tissues. The two highest expressing tissues were the eyelid (CT = 21.3) and skin (CT = 23.2) (Fig. 2, bottom panel). An abundance of FAR2 mRNA in these tissues is consistent with a role for this reductase isozyme in lipid synthesis within the meibomian glands of the eyelid and the sebaceous glands of the skin. Both FAR1 and FAR2 mRNAs are present in the brain where large quantities of ether lipids are synthesized. RNA blotting experiments indicated an abundant FAR1 mRNA of 4.2 kb in the preputial gland together with a minor species of 3.8 kb. Similarly, an abundant FAR2 mRNA of 2.7 kb was detected in eyelid RNA along with minor species of 1.7 and 3.3 kb (data not shown). Complementary DNAs encoding mouse and human FAR1 and FAR2 were cloned into mammalian expression vectors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression of FAR1 and FAR2 cDNAs in HEK 293 cells resulted in the conversion of BSA-conjugated [14C]palmitate into [14C]hexadecanol (Fig. 3, lanes 2-5), whereas transfection of a vector lacking a cDNA insert did not produce hexadecanol (lane 1), indicating that HEK 293 cells have negligible levels of endogenous fatty acyl-CoA reductase activity. Several conclusions were reached from these results. First, the putative mammalian FAR cDNAs identified by bioinformatics encoded bona fide fatty acyl-CoA reductases. Second, there are two fatty acyl-CoA reductase isozymes in the mouse and human as well as other mammalian genomes (see “Discussion”). Third, comparisons of the results in Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3, with those in lanes 4 and 5 indicated that the expressed mouse and human FAR1 enzymes were more active than the corresponding FAR2 enzymes in transfected HEK 293 cells. In an effort to increase expression of FAR1 and FAR2, the mouse cDNAs were recombined into baculovirus expression vectors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected, FAR1- and FAR2-expressing viruses produced higher levels of enzyme activity in intact insect cells compared with those obtained in HEK 293 cells, but the levels of FAR1 enzyme activity in the Sf9 cells remained ∼5-10-fold higher than those of FAR2 despite equivalent levels of expression (data not shown). These results suggested that the difference in activity between the recombinant FAR1 and FAR2 enzymes reflected the intrinsic properties of the proteins and was not the result of an anomaly between the mammalian and insect cell expression systems. For these reasons the two expression systems were used interchangeably in subsequent experiments to characterize FAR1 and FAR2. Centrifugation experiments with cell lysates from FAR1 baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells showed that reductase enzyme activity sedimented with the membrane fraction. Assays with membrane preparations showed that enzyme activity with palmitoyl-CoA substrate was optimal over a range of magnesium (3-32 mm) and KCl (0-200 mm) concentrations and between pH 7.0 and 8.0. When the assay buffer had a pH greater than 8.0, considerable nonenzymatic conversion of fatty acyl-CoA to fatty alcohol was observed. No inhibition of FAR1 activity was detected in the presence of excess product (0.5 mm hexadecanol). Based on these findings, the standard FAR1 enzyme assay was performed in a buffer of pH 7.4 containing 3.0 mm MgCl2 and 0 mm KCl for 30 min at 37 °C. In contrast to the results obtained with membranes from FAR1-expressing cells, FAR2 enzyme activity was lost upon lysis of either baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells or transfected HEK 293 cells (data not shown). FAR2 enzyme activity was not detected with the inclusion of different fatty acid substrates, NAD(P)H cofactors, or detergents in the assay buffer, and variations in the ionic conditions or in the incubation time failed to resuscitate FAR2 enzyme activity. Thus, we were only able to analyze FAR2 enzyme activity in whole cells. Fatty acyl-CoA reductases catalyze a concerted reaction in which the thioester bond of the fatty acyl-CoA substrate is cleaved, and the resulting fatty acid is reduced to an alcohol by transfer of electrons from an NAD(P)H cofactor (16Bishop J.E. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9542-9550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A series of experiments was performed to determine the substrate and cofactor utilized by mouse FAR1. As shown by the data in Fig. 4A, con"
https://openalex.org/W2009286649,"Ensemble neuronal activity was recorded in each layer of the whisker area of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) while rats performed a whisker-dependent tactile discrimination task. Comparison of this activity with SI activity evoked by similar passive whisker stimulation revealed fundamental differences in tactile signal processing during active and passive stimulation. Moreover, significant layer-specific functional differences in SI activity were observed during active discrimination. These differences could not be explained solely by variations in ascending thalamocortical input to SI. Instead, these results suggest that top-down influences during active discrimination may alter the overall functional nature of SI as well as layer-specific mechanisms of tactile processing."
https://openalex.org/W1622207681,"The nuclear factor–kappa B (NF-κB) family of transcription factors plays a seminal role in inflammation, apoptosis, development, and cancer. Modulation of NF-κB–mediated gene expression in response to diverse signals is coordinated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. We identified ELKS, an essential regulatory subunit of the IKK complex. Silencing ELKS expression by RNA interference blocked induced expression of NF-κB target genes, including the NF-κB inhibitor I κ B α and proinflammatory genes such as cyclo-oxygenase 2 and interleukin 8 . These cells were also not protected from apoptosis in response to cytokines. ELKS likely functions by recruiting IκBα to the IKK complex and thus serves a regulatory function for IKK activation."
https://openalex.org/W1982089215,"DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) plays an essential role in murine development and is thought to be the enzyme primarily responsible for maintenance of the global methylation status of genomic DNA. However, loss of DNMT1 in human cancer cells affects only the methylation status of a limited number of pericentromeric sequences. Here we show that human cancer cells lacking DNMT1 display at least two important differences with respect to wild type cells: a profound disorganization of nuclear architecture, and an altered pattern of histone H3 modification that results in an increase in the acetylation and a decrease in the dimethylation and trimethylation of lysine 9. Additionally, this phenotype is associated with a loss of interaction of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) with histone H3 and pericentromeric repetitive sequences (satellite 2). Our data indicate that DNMT1 activity, via maintenance of the appropriate histone H3 modifications, contributes to the preservation of the correct organization of large heterochromatic regions.

Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is an epigenetic phenomenon involved in regulating important intranuclear events, such as the organization of chromatin structure, transcriptional control, and replication timing (1Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). The process is characterized by the transfer of methyl groups to the C-5 position of cytosine and is catalyzed by members of the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1The abbreviations used are: DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; 5mC, 5-methylcytosine; HDAC, histone deacetylase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; WT, wild type; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling; HPCE, high performance capillary electrophoresis; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; HMTase, histone methyltransferase; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; Sat2, satellite 2. protein family. To date, five mammalian DNMTs have been identified as follows: DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, DNMT2, and DNMT3L (1Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Of these five, DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b are known to be essential for proper development in murine knockout models (1Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol.

Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). DNMT1, the most abundant DNA methyltransferase in somatic cells, has a strong preference for hemimethylated DNA and is therefore believed to be the enzyme primarily responsible for copying and maintaining methylation patterns from the parental to the daughter strand following DNA replication (1Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Strikingly, significant genomic hypomethylation was only found at pericentromeric satellite 2 and 3 sequences in human cancer cells lacking DNMT1 (KO1 cells) (4Rhee I. Jair K.W. Yen R.W. Lengauer C. Herman J.G. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Baylin S.B. Schuebel K.E. Nature. 2000; 404: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility of regional specificity on the part of DNMT1 and, furthermore, that DNMT1 loss might be partially compensated by other DNMTs (4Rhee I. Jair K.W. Yen R.W. Lengauer C.

Accumulated evidence suggests that DNA methylation status and changes in the biochemical modification of histone tails, the “histone code,” can regulate the higher order organization and function of large intranuclear regions, implicating these modifications in chromosome positioning and the maintenance of specific chromatin domains within the nucleus in a wide variety of organisms (5Cremer T.

Recent data from plant cells indicate that loss of methylated CpG dinucleotides alters the methylation pattern of histone H3 (11Tariq M. Saze H. Probst A.V. Lichota J. Habu Y. Paszkowski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8823-8827Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suggesting that DNA methylation may also function as a central signal for the regulation of chromatin structure. A reciprocal dependence may exist, because mouse embryonic stem cells lacking Suv39h histone methyltransferases display an altered DNA methylation profile at pericentric satellite repeats (12Lehnertz B.

In order to determine the significance of DNA methylation with regard to chromatin and nuclear organization in humans, we used KO1 cells to investigate the consequences of a loss of methylation in a large but well defined intranuclear region, pericentromeric repeats. Cell Culture, Cell Cycle Analysis, and Cell Transfections—Human HCT-116 colon cancer cells (WT cells) and HCT116 knockout cells lacking DNMT1 (KO1) (4Rhee I. Jair K.W. Yen R.W. Lengauer C.

KO1 cells were also supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma). All analyses were carried out before passage 22. For cell cycle analysis, cells were trypsinized, slowly resuspended in 70% ethanol in PBS at 4 °C for 5 min, washed in PBS, and incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml RNase I (Sigma). The cell suspension was then analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). TUNEL assays (Roche Applied Science) were performed in early sub-confluent cells following the instructions of the manufacturer. For re-expression of DNMT1, KO1 cells were cotransfected with a pcDNA3.1/B plasmid (Invitrogen) containing the murine DNMT1 cDNA (13Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 1.6 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for at least 1 week. Stocks of resistant cells expressing the murine DNMT1 were selected for further studies. Nuclear Extracts—Trypsinized cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in 10 volumes of cell lysis buffer (0.65 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 2% Triton X-100), and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of NT buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100) containing 10 units of DNase I (TURBO DNase, Ambion), plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Samples were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. Antibodies and Immunological Methods—The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against acetyl-Lys-9 histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.); trimethyl-Lys-9 histone H3 (generously provided by Dr. Thomas Jenuwein) (14Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana I. Shinkai Y. Martens J.H. Jenuwein T. Mol.

Niveleau). Secondary antibodies used included anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Amersham Biosciences), anti-mouse IgG Cy3-conjugate, and anti-rabbit IgG Cy2 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of nuclear protein extracts were performed as described (15Espada J. Perez-Moreno M. Braga V.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Cano A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Standard chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as described previously (16Ballestar E. Paz M.F. Valle L. Wei S. Fraga M.F. Espada J. Cigudosa J.C. Huang T.H.-M. Esteller M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6335-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 17Fournier C. Goto Y. Ballestar E. Delaval K. Hever A.M. Esteller M. Feil R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). When investigating HDAC association, prior to formaldehyde cross-linking, cells were also treated with the protein-protein cross-linking agent dimethyl adipimidate (10 mm in PBS containing 0.25% Me2SO) for 45 min (18Kurdistani S.K. Robyr D. Tavazoie S. Grunstein M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Chromatin was sheared by sonication with a Branson Sonifier 250 to an average length of 0.25-1.0 kb. PCR amplification was performed in 25-μl volumes with primers specific for each promoter analyzed. For each of these, the linear range of PCR amplification was evaluated empirically by serial dilution of total DNA collected after sonication (input fraction). This previous titration step yields semiquantitative PCR data (with an approximate error of 10-20%), which is generally sensitive enough to allow changes in histone modifications and association of nuclear factors to be monitored. Primers used are as follows: 5′-TCG CAT AGA ATC GAA TGG AA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCA TTC GAG TCC GTG GA-3′ (antisense) for satellite 2; and 5′-CTC AGC GAG GAA GAA TAC CG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACC GGG CCT AGA CCT AGA AG-3′ (antisense) for D4Z4. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on coverslips in P60 dishes, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and stained as described previously (15Espada J. Perez-Moreno M. Braga V.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Cano A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells to be analyzed for 5mC were postfixed in cold methanol, treated with 1 m HCl at 37 °C for 30 min, and stained as described by Habib et al. (19Habib M. Fares F. Bourgeois C.A. Bella C. Bernardino J. Hernandez-Blazquez F. de Capoa A. Niveleau A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Confocal optical sections were obtained using a Leica TCS SP microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with krypton and argon lasers. Images were acquired with Leica LCS Lite software and processed with Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.) and publicly available NIH image software. The values obtained correspond to the integrated density of the total fluorescent emission per nuclear area of the signals in 50 nuclei from each experiment. Values, in arbitrary units, are shown as averages (± S.D.). Electron Microscopy—Cells were grown to subconfluence in F-25 flasks, washed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, and fixed in a solution of 2% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were treated postfixation with 1% OsO4 and 1% K3Fe(CN)6. After three washes with sodium cacodylate, samples were dehydrated with ethanol, treated with propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon (Resolution Performance Products). Ultrathin sections were prepared, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined at 80 kV under a JEOL 1010 electron microscope. Quantification of Whole Histone Acetylation by High Performance Capillary Electrophoresis (HPCE)—The degree of histone H3 acetylation was measured by a modification of methods described previously (20Lindner H. Helliger W. Dirschlmayer A. Jaquemar M. Puschendorf B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell nuclei were obtained as described (21Weintraub H. Palter K. Van Lente F. Cell. 1975; 6: 83-88Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and histones were extracted by acid extraction with the addition of 0.25 m HCl followed by acetone precipitation. Histones were fractionated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Beckman-Coulter) on a Delta-Pak C18 column (Waters) and eluted with an acetonitrile gradient (20-60%) in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid using an HPLC gradient system. Histone purity was tested by SDS-PAGE. The non-, mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-acetylated derivatives of the H3 fraction were resolved by HPCE. Quantification of Genomic 5mC Content by HPCE—The degree of methylation was determined essentially as described by Fraga et al. (22Fraga M.F. Uriol E. Borja D.L. Berdasco M. Esteller M. Canal M.J. Rodriguez R. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 1677-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Genomic DNA (150 μg) was first treated with the 4-base frequent cutter MseI. This endonuclease digests genomic DNA into 100-200-bp fragments. Its recognition sequence, TTAA, rarely occurs within GC-rich regions, leaving most CpG islands (700-1200 bp on average) intact (23Cross S.H. Charlton J.A. Nan X. Bird A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 24Huang T.H. Perry M.R. Laux D.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). MseI-digested DNA was fractionated by using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA fragments of ∼200-400, 700-1200, and 1800-2100 bp were purified from the gels. As demonstrated by PCR, the 200-400- and 1800-2100-bp fractions were enriched in different genomic repeats, like the Alu8 and Alu4 family of retrotransposon-derived repeats, the satellite 2 tandem repeat, the minisatellite single-sequence repeat, and the ribosomal DNA gene tandem repeat. None of these sequences was present in the 700-1200-bp fraction, and the 200-400- and 1800-2100-bp fractions were defined as the repetitive fraction. On the other hand, it was established by PCR that the 700-1200-bp fraction mainly contained CpG islands such as the promoter region of the androgen receptor, RAS association domain family 1A (RASSF1A), and the E-cadherin (CDH1) genes. Primer sequences and PCR conditions are available upon request. These sequences were not present in the repetitive fraction, and the 700-1200-bp fraction was defined as the CpG fraction. Most interestingly, the D4Z4 repeat was mainly contained in the CpG fraction. Each DNA fraction was purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and then DNA was enzymatically hydrolyzed with nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) and directly injected in a CE system (P/ACE™ MDQ, Beckman-Coulter) connected to a data processing station (32 Karat™ software) equipped with an uncoated fused silica capillary (BD Biosciences) (60.2 cm × 75 μm, effective length, 50 cm). The running buffer was 14 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, containing 20 mm SDS. Running conditions were 25 °C and an operating voltage of 17 kV. On-column absorbance was monitored at 254 nm. All samples were analyzed in duplicate, and three analytical measurements were made per replicate. Quantification of the relative methylation of each DNA sample was determined as the percentage of mC of total cytosines: mC peak area × 100/(C peak area + mC peak area). Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing—We carried out bisulfite modification of genomic DNA as described previously (25Paz M.F. Wei S. Cigudosa J.C. Rodriguez-Perales S. Peinado M.A. Huang T.H. Esteller M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2209-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The DNA methylation status at the 5′-end of the 28 S component of ribosomal DNA was analyzed by bisulfite genomic sequencing of their corresponding CpG islands, as described by Paz et al. (25Paz M.F. Wei S. Cigudosa J.C. Rodriguez-Perales S. Peinado M.A. Huang T.H. Esteller M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2209-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Both strands were sequenced. The primer sequences used are as follows: 5′-GAG TGA ATA GGG AAG AGT TTA G-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAA ATT CTT TTC AAC TTT CCC TTA C-3′ (antisense). PCR conditions for the methylation analysis are available upon request. Micrococcal Nuclease Analysis—Accessibility to micrococcal nuclease in wild type and KO1 HCT116 cells was investigated. Cells were lysed by incubation with cold RSB buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2) in the presence of protease inhibitors for 10 min. Once the nuclei had been isolated, the nuclear pellet was resuspended with wash buffer of 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, preincubated at 37 °C, and digested with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (20 units/ml) after addition of 0.2 mm CaCl2. Two chromatin fractions were analyzed as follows: whole genomic DNA, obtained when directly extracting DNA from each sample, and soluble chromatin, containing mainly mononucleosomes, when centrifuging the cells after digestion and isolating the DNA from the supernatant. Specific Loss of Cytosine Methylation in Repetitive Genomic Sequences in Human Cells Lacking DNMT1—We initially analyzed the total content and the biochemical distribution of 5mC in distinct genomic fractions in both wild type (WT) HCT-116 and KO1 cells. In accordance with data reported previously, we confirmed a reduction of only 20% in the total 5mC content in KO1 cells compared with WT cells (4Rhee I. Jair K.W. Yen R.W. Lengauer C. Herman J.G. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Baylin S.B. Schuebel K.E. Nature. 2000; 404: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). However, when genomic DNA was separated into two major fractions, consisting of repetitive sequences (repetitive fraction) and CpG islands (CpG-rich fraction; see “Experimental Procedures”) before the analysis of the 5mC content, we observed that the loss of 5mC in KO1 occurred mainly in the repetitive fraction (40% loss of 5mC) (Fig. 1). The repetitive fraction contained genomic repeats such as satellite 2 (Sat2) and the ribosomal DNA repeat unit, whereas CpG islands of gene promoters were essentially contained in the CpG-rich fraction (see “Experimental Procedures”). Indeed, bisulfite genomic sequencing of the CpG-rich region at the 5′-end of the 28 S component of ribosomal DNA demonstrated that HCT-116 wild type cells are methylated at this region, whereas KO1 cells are hypomethylated (Fig. 1B). In fact, the D4Z4 locus, a polymorphic tandem repeat found to be hypomethylated in ICF (immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability and facial anomalies) syndrome patients harboring mutations in DNMT3b (26Kondo T. Kondo T. Bobek M.P. Kuick R. Lamb B. Zhu X. Narayan A. Bourc'his D. Viegas-Pequignot E. Ehrlich M. Hanash S.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), mainly occurred within the CpG fraction. These results suggest a central role of DNMT1 in the methylation of specifically repetitive sequences, a role that is also supported by studies on mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in DNMT1 (27Liang G. Chan M.F. Tomigahara Y. Tsai Y.C. Gonzales F.A. Li E. Laird P.W. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 480-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 28Woodcock D.M. Linsenmeyer M.E. Warren W.D. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 206: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Morphological Alterations in the Nucleus of Human Cells Lacking DNMT1—We next investigated the cytochemical distribution of 5mC in WT and KO1 cells. WT cells showed a punctated homogeneous distribution of 5mC throughout the nucleus (Fig. 2A). These cells also displayed a characteristic DAPI staining pattern consisting of discrete spots of strongly positive regions corresponding to the spatial arrangement of heterochromatin in the nucleus (Fig. 2A). Colocalization analysis in 0.2-μm thick confocal sections showed that the heterochromatic, DAPI-positive regions in WT cells were not associated with a particular pattern of 5mC distribution (Fig. 2B). On the contrary, KO1 cells showed a large intranuclear invagination after 5mC staining, often displaying a “doughnut”-like appearance with a central cavity lacking a positive signal and a punctated heterogeneous 5mC distribution in the rest of the nucleus (Fig. 2A). This invagination, which is present in 80-90% of KO1 cells, traverses the nucleus (Fig. 2C) and is associated with a DAPI-negative region (Fig. 2, A-C). The pattern of DAPI staining also revealed an altered distribution of strongly DAPI-positive regions that became smaller and more diffuse in KO1 cells (Fig. 2A). Confocal analysis of 5mC and DAPI staining clearly revealed the diffuse and disorganized nature of heterochromatic DAPI-positive regions in KO1 cells. Again, in this case, these were not associated with a particular pattern of 5mC distribution (Fig. 2B). To investigate a possible relationship between the appearance of an aberrant nuclear morphology in KO1 cells and alterations in the cell cycle, we performed a flow cytometry analysis of WT and KO1 cells. No significant differences were observed in the G0/G1 and S phase populations of WT and KO1 cells (Fig. 2D). We observed by FACS a small increase (6%) of the apoptotic (sub-G0) population in KO1 cells compared with WT cells, corresponding to a very small population of cells according to the TUNEL assay. This extremely minor increase in the apoptotic population is highly unlikely to be responsible for the severe nuclear alteration observed in the KO1 cells. To investigate further the morphological phenotype associated with the loss of DNMT1 in human cells, we performed an ultrastructural analysis of WT and KO1 cells. At the electron microscopic level, WT cells showed an entire nuclear envelope with no clear deformations in most cases (Fig. 3A). In these cells, one to three compact and spherical nucleolar masses, composed of a prominent granular region in which small fibrillar regions are embedded, were usually found in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 3A). By contrast, severe deformations and many deep and irregular folds on the nuclear envelope were found in most KO1 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The nucleolar substructure was similar in KO1 and WT cells. However, in KO1 cells the nucleolar masses appeared distorted and segregated and were commonly attached to the invaginations of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 3, A and B). Therefore, the central cavity observed in 5mC and DAPI-stained KO1 nuclei corresponds to a great alteration in the nuclear architecture. The explanation that the appearance of the aberrant nuclear morphology in KO1 cells was an indirect effect of the loss of DNMT1 cannot be discounted at present. However, all the above results suggest an important role for DNMT1 in the maintenance of the structural nuclear arrangement. Loss of DNMT1 in Human Cells Is Associated with Changes in the Histone H3 Modification Pattern—Given the tight connection between DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin structure (12Lehnertz B.

Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), it is plausible to expect changes in histone modifications in human cells with depleted DNMT1. In fact, complete removal of CpG methylation in plant cells results in a loss of histone H3 (H3) methylation at lysine 9 (11Tariq M. Saze H. Probst A.V. Lichota J. Habu Y. Paszkowski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8823-8827Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Loss of acetylation and increased methylation at the Lys-9 residue of H3 have been associated with chromatin compaction and the formation of heterochromatin (14Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana I. Shinkai Y. Martens J.H. Jenuwein T. Mol.

Genet. 2002; 30: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In particular, trimethylation of H3 at Lys-9 (TriMetK9H3) is a marker for constitutive heterochromatin (32Peters A.H. Mermoud J.E. O'Carroll D. Pagani M. Schweizer D. Brockdorff N. Jenuwein T. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). By using specific antibodies for DiMetK9H3 and TriMetK9H3 in immunoblot analysis of total protein extracts, we observed a strong decrease of both methylated Lys-9 H3 species in KO1 cells when compared with WT cells (Fig. 4A). Conversely, we observed the presence of higher levels of acetylated H3 in KO1 cells. In particular, by using HPLC-purified H3, an increase of about 30% in the H3 acetylation content of KO1 compared with WT cells was established (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the loss of DNMT1 in human cells is associated with the disorganization of heterochromatin. To investigate this matter further, we performed a comparative chromatin accessibility experiment using MNase digestions of KO1 and HCT116 cells. When isolating whole genomic DNA after different incubation times with MNase, we found KO1 to be more accessible to MNase than was HCT116. In fact, after 1 min of digestion, over 80% of the DNA was already in discrete polynucleosomal subunits for KO1 cells, whereas less than 20% of the DNA was digested in wild type cells (Fig. 4C). Moreover, when isolating the soluble fraction of chromatin after MNase digestion, KO1 cells exhibited a faster burst of mononucleosomal release (around 5 min of digestion compared with 10 min for wild type cells) (Fig. 4C), supporting the notion that chromatin in KO1 cells is more accessible, probably as a consequence of profound changes in heterochromatin organization. At the cell level, immunolocalization analysis of the distribution of DiMetK9H3 and AcK9H3 in the nucleus of KO1 and WT cells suggested a quantitative switch rather than a qualitative change in spatial distribution of these two modified forms of H3 (Fig. 5). An optical measure of these observations by densitometric analysis showed a close agreement with the immunoblot and HPLC analysis described above (Figs. 4 and 5). These results confirmed at the cell level that lack of DNMT1 expression in human cancer cells is associated with a global nuclear change in the acetylation and methylation pattern of H3. The analysis of the distribution of TriMetK9H3 also indicated a quantitative diminution of this modified form of H3 in the nucleus of KO1 cells (Fig. 5). In addition, a change of the spatial localization of TriMetK9H3 was observed in KO1 cells. Thus, the TriMetK9H3 signal was found mainly associated with discrete nuclear spots corresponding to DAPI-positive heterochromatin in WT cells (Fig. 5). However, a dispersed and diffused localization of TriMetK9H3 was observed in the nucleus of KO1 cells (Fig. 5), showing the disorganization of constitutive heterochromatin at the cell level. Loss of the Interaction of HP1 with Methylated Lysine 9 at Histone H3 and with Repetitive Satellite 2 Genomic Sequences in Human Cells Lacking DNMT1—In human cells, methylation of histone H3 at Lys-9 by the site-specific histone methyltransferase (HMTase), Suv39h, creates a binding site for HP1 proteins (33Bannister A.J.

https://openalex.org/W1984071687,"The ability of rats to use their whiskers for fine tactile discrimination rivals that of humans using their fingertips. Rats perform discriminations rapidly and accurately while palpating the environment with their whiskers. This suggests that whisker deflections produce a robust and reliable neural code. Whisker primary afferents respond with highly reproducible temporal spike patterns to transient stimuli. Here we show that, with the use of a linear kernel, any of these reproducible response trains recorded from an individual neuron can reliably predict complex whisker deflections. These predictions are significantly improved by integrating responses from neurons with opposite angular preferences."

Microcephaly is a congenital reduction in brain size greater than three standard deviations (S.D.) below the age-related mean. Primary microcephaly (MCPH, OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man) 251200) is further defined by the absence of significant neurological deficits, other than variable degrees of mental retardation (1Suri M.

The genes at two of these loci have been identified. The ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated) gene at the MCPH5 locus encodes the human ortholog of the Drosophila melanogaster abnormal spindle gene (asp), which is essential for normal mitotic spindle function in embryonic neuroblasts (2Bond J.

Depletion of endogenous NFBD1 also impairs IR-induced ATM activation (17Mochan T.A. Venere M. DiTullio Jr, R.A. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8586-8591PubMed Google Scholar). The potential role of Mcph1 in IR-induced checkpoints has yet to be elucidated.In this study, we show that Mcph1 forms IR-induced foci. Inhibition of Mcph1 expression by siRNA leads to the defective IR-induced intra-S-phase and G2/M checkpoints and is associated with decrease of Brca1 and Chk1 both at the mRNA and protein levels. We conclude that Mcph1 is involved in DNA damage-induced cellular responses, and we propose that regulation of Brca1 and/or Chk1 by Mcph1 may contribute to these cellular responses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Full-length human Mcph1 was compiled from two expressed sequence tag clones (IMAGE 6277985 and 4838618) by PCR and subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3HA and pcDNA3FLAG-GST vector, resulting in pcDNA-HA-Mcph1 and pcDNA-Flag-GST-Mcph1, respectively. These constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Primer sequences and detailed cloning strategies are available upon request.Northern Analysis—Probes for Northern blots correspond to nt 1861–2060 of the Mcph1 coding sequence, nt 1082–1281 of the Chk1 coding sequence, nt 5189–5428 of the Brca1 coding sequence, and nt 778–904 of the human β-actin coding sequence. These fragments were amplified from pcDNA-HA-Mcph1, pcDNA-HA-Chk1, 2X. Xu and D. F. Stern, unpublished data. pcDNA-HA-Brca1 (a kind gift of David Livingston), and a human β-actin cDNA fragment (Ambion), respectively, using reverse primers with T7 promoter sequence incorporated. The [32P]CTP-labeled antisense RNA probes were synthesized on these PCR templates using T7 MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Northern blots were performed using NorthernMax kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA—The siRNA duplexes were 21 base pairs including a 2-base overhang synthesized by Dharmacon Research. The sequences of siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes that target Mcph1/Brit1 are as follows: M1, 5′-AGGAAGUUGGAAGGAUCCAdTdT-3′ (nt 745–763 of the Mcph1 coding sequence (4Lin S.Y. Elledge S.J.

M2–M5 were four siGENOME duplexes developed by Dharmacon Research. The sequences of siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes that target NFBD1 (8Xu X. Stern D.F. J. Biol.

Cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.Radio-resistant DNA Synthesis Assay—The RDS assay was performed as described (11Xu B. Kim S. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotide complex, and 36 h later, [14C]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)/ml was added to a final concentration of 10 nCi of and incubated overnight. The medium containing [14C]thymidine was then replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated for another 24 h. Cells were irradiated, incubated for 45 min at 37 °C, and then pulse-labeled with 5 μCi of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)/ml for 30 min. Cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 70% methanol for at least 30 min. The cells were transferred to Whatman GF/C filters and fixed sequentially with 70% and then 95% methanol, then filters were air-dried, and the amount of radioactivity was assayed in a liquid scintillation counter. The resulting ratios of 3H counts/min to 14C counts/min, corrected for background and channel crossover, were a measure of DNA synthesis.Immunofluorescent Detection of Phosphorylated Histone H3—Cells were harvested 1–2 h after irradiation, washed with PBS, resuspended in 2 ml of PBS (up to 5 × 106 cells), and fixed in suspension on ice by the gradual addition of 6 ml of 100% ethanol and by incubation at 4 °C for at least 1 h and as long as several days. After fixation, the cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were washed once with PBS and suspended in 200 μl of PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology) was added, and suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBST and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted at a ratio of 1:150 in PBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed again, resuspended in 8 μg of propidium iodide (Sigma)/ml and 0.1 mg of RNase A (Sigma)/ml in PBS, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before fluorescence was measured. Cellular fluorescence and DNA content were measured by using a BD Biosciences fluorescence-activated cell sorter Vantage three laser, eight parameter flow cytometer.Indirect Immunofluorescence—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described before (19Xu X. Stern D.F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1842-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting have been described before (19Xu X. Stern D.F. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1842-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-Brit1/Mcph1 (AbCam), anti-NFBD1 (8Xu X. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8795-8803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), anti-Chk2 T68 (20Tsvetkov L. Xu X. Li J. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8468-8475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), anti-phospho-histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-histone H3 (Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse monoclonal antibodies used were anti-Brca1 (Ab-1, Oncogene), anti-Chk2 (clone 7), anti-53BP1 (clone BP18, Upstate Biotechnology), anti-phospho-ATM Ser1981 (clone 10H11.E12, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-ATM (clone 2C1, GeneTex), anti-Chk1 (clone G4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (clone AC-15), anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose gel, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPTCBs other than Mcph1 form IR-induced foci (IRIF) that colocalize with IRIF produced by other DNA damage checkpoint proteins. We sought to determine whether Mcph1 forms IRIF. The rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab2612, AbCam) recognized a protein of ∼100 kDa in both U2OS and HEK293 cells and an additional protein of about 130 kDa in cells transfected with FLAG-GST-tagged Mcph1 (supplemental Fig. 1 and data not shown). Since, in our hands, the anti-Mcph1 antibody was not suitable for immunofluorescence (data not shown), we instead examined the potential of HA-tagged Mcph1 to form IRIF (Fig. 1). HA-Mcph1 IRIF in HEK293 cells colocalized with those of NFBD1 (Fig. 1) and other DNA damage checkpoint proteins (data not shown). This indicates that Mcph1 is involved in cellular responses to DNA damage.To investigate the functions of Mcph1, we inhibited Mcph1 expression with a siRNA oligonucleotide duplex (MCPH1si) (4Lin S.Y. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2003; 113: 881-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The Mcph1 transcript was significantly diminished (Fig. 2A), and its protein level was moderately decreased (Fig. 2B) in U2OS cells 60 h posttransfection with MCPH1si (M1 oligonucleotide complex), while neither the Mcph1 transcript nor protein levels were reduced by a control siRNA oligonucleotide duplex (LUCsi) that targets the luciferase gene (Fig. 2, A and B). Inhibition of Mcph1 expression in U2OS cells by siRNA did not alter cell cycle profiles (data not shown). Transfection of MCPH1si into U2OS cells stably expressing either HA-tagged or FLAG-GST-tagged Mcph1 inhibited expression of both endogenous and tagged Mcph1 (supplemental Fig. 2 and data not shown). We also tested five additional siRNA oligonucleotide complexes (M2–M6) against different regions of the Mcph1 coding sequence. M2 and M3 depleted Mcph1 transcript and protein to a lesser extent than M1 (data not shown). Transfection of M4–M6 into U2OS cells did not alter Mcph1 protein levels (data not shown). These results demonstrated the specificity of the Mcph1 antibody and the siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes for Mcph1.Fig. 2Down-regulation of Brca1 and Chk1 by inhibition of Mcph1 expression.A, inhibition of Mcph1 expression by siRNA. U2OS cells were transfected with a control siRNA oligonucleotide (LUCsi) or siRNA oligonucleotides that target Mcph1 (MCPH1si). Total RNA was isolated 60 h posttransfection for Northern analysis. B, depletion of Mcph1 decreases protein levels of Brca1 and Chk1. Cells transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides were either mock-treated or irradiated with 4 Gy, then harvested after incubation for 1 or 2 h at 37 °C. Total cell lysates were immunoblotted for proteins as indicated. C, Mcph1 inhibition reduces levels of Brca1 and Chk1 transcripts. U2OS cells were treated as described in the legend to A. Total RNA was isolated for Northern blot analysis of the transcripts indicated. D, Mcph1 siRNA down-regulates exogenous Chk1 protein but not exogenous Brca1 protein. U2OS cells stably expressing HA-Brca1 or HA-Chk1 were treated as described in the legend to B. Total cell lysates were immunoblotted for proteins as indicated. E, inhibition of Mcph1 expression by siRNA reduces exogenous Chk1 transcript but not exogenous Brca1 transcript. U2OS cells stably expressing HA-Brca1 or HA-Chk1 were treated as described in the legend to A. Total RNA was isolated for Northern blot analysis of the transcripts indicated.

Depletion of NFBD1, but not 53BP1 or Brca1, reduces activation of ATM (17Mochan T.A. Venere M. DiTullio Jr, R.A. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8586-8591PubMed Google Scholar).2 We used phospho-specific antibodies that recognize Chk1 p-S345, Chk2 p-T68, and ATM p-S1981 as markers for activation of these checkpoint kinases (23Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 24Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E.

Depletion of Mcph1 in U2OS cells did not affect IR-induced activation of Chk2 (Fig. 2B) or ATM (supplemental Fig. 3). However, Mcph1 knockdown significantly reduced Chk1 and Brca1 protein levels (Fig. 2B) and, accordingly, Chk1 p-S345 levels (data not shown). Down-regulation of Brca1 and Chk1 protein levels by inhibition of Mcph1 expression in U2OS cells correlated with a decrease in transcripts encoding Brca1 and Chk1, respectively (Fig. 2C). Transfection of M2 or M3 complex into U2OS cells reduced, to a lesser degree, both Brca1 and Chk1 at transcript and protein levels (data not shown). Transfection of MCPH1si into human keratinocyte HaCaT cells also down-regulated expression of Mcph1, Brca1, and Chk1 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that inhibition of Mcph1 by siRNA causes down-regulation of Brca1 and Chk1 and indicate that it is unlikely that this outcome is due to off-target activity of the siRNA oligonucleotide complexes against Mcph1.We sought to determine if siRNA against Mcph1 would down-regulate exogenous Brca1 or Chk1 under the control of a heterologous promoter. Transfection of MCPH1si into U2OS cells stably expressing HA-Chk1 resulted in a decrease in both protein and transcript levels of endogenous and exogenous Chk1 (Fig. 2, D and E). This suggests that Mcph1 regulates both protein and mRNA stability of Chk1, possibly not the promoter activity of Chk1. Inhibition of Mcph1 by MCPH1si in U2OS cells stably expressing HA-Brca1 caused a decrease of endogenous Brca1, but not exogenous Brca1, at both protein and transcript levels (Figs. 2, D and E). This suggests that Mcph1 may be involved in regulation of Brca1 promoter activity and/or maturation of Brca1 mRNA. Mcph1 apparently regulates Brca1 and Chk1 levels using different mechanisms.We then determined whether depletion of other PTCBs would affect protein and transcript levels of Brca1 and Chk1. siRNA knockdown of NFBD1, 53BP1, or Brca1 reduced both protein and transcript levels of Brca1 to different degrees and did not affect expression of Chk1 RNA and protein (Fig. 3, A and B). This suggests a dependence of Brca1 accumulation on NFBD1, 53BP1, and Mcph1 and a unique regulation of Chk1 by Mcph1. We propose that DNA damage checkpoint defects associated with the inhibition of the expression of NFBD1 or 53BP1 may be mediated in part by down-regulation of both protein and transcript levels of Brca1, in addition to defects in activation of Chk1 and/or Chk2.Fig. 3Depletion of NFBD1/MDC1, 53BP1, and/or Brca1 does not affect Chk1 levels.A, U2OS cells were transfected with LUCsi or oligonucleotides that target Mcph1, NFBD1, 53BP1, or Brca1.

Pardo-Reoyo S. Sgagias M. Cowan K.H. Brody L.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Brca1 is also required for the IR-induced S-phase checkpoint (11Xu B. Kim S. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Depletion of Chk1 by siRNA confers both intra-S-phase and G2/M checkpoint defects (26Xiao Z. Chen Z.

To determine whether Mcph1 plays a role in DNA damage checkpoints, we examined the integrity of IR-induced checkpoints in Mcph1-inhibited cells. The IR-induced intra-S-phase checkpoint reduces RDS. Compared with control cells, Mcph1-inhibited cells showed higher, but variable, RDS when exposed to 5- or 10-Gy irradiation (data not shown), and significantly higher RDS when irradiated with 20 Gy (Fig. 4A). This result indicates a role of Mcph1 in the intra-S-phase checkpoint.Fig. 4DNA damage-induced checkpoint defects associated with depletion of Mcph1 by siRNA.A, Mcph1 siRNA induces radio-resistant DNA synthesis. Replicative DNA synthesis was assessed 45 min after 20-Gy irradiation in U2OS cells transfected with LUCsi or MCPH1si oligonucleotides. RDS is expressed as a percentage of DNA synthesis in irradiated cultures versus that in unirradiated cells. Each experiment included five replicate samples. B, analysis of the G2-M DNA damage checkpoint associated with Mcph1 siRNA by immunoblotting for phospho-histone H3. Cells transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides were either mock-treated or irradiated with 4 Gy, then harvested after incubation for 1 or 2 h at 37 °C. Half of the cells were lysed and immunoblotted with antibodies to phospho-histone H3 (p-H3), total histone H3, and Mcph1. C, analysis of the G2-M DNA damage checkpoint by flow cytometry. The remaining half of the cells analyzed in B was fixed. Cells in mitosis were identified by staining with anti-p-H3, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody and propidium iodide, and the percentage of the M-phase cells was determined by flow cytometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine the G2/M checkpoint, we used phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) (p-H3) as a mitotic marker. Mcph1-inhibited U2OS cells had a significantly higher portion of p-H3 2 h after 4-Gy irradiation in comparison with the control cells (Fig. 4B). Flow cytometry analysis of p-H3-positive cells revealed that approximately 30-fold more Mcph1-inhibited cells than control cells enter mitosis 2 h after 4-Gy irradiation (Fig. 4C). Therefore, inhibition of Mcph1 expression is associated with a G2/M checkpoint defect. We failed to detect a G2/M checkpoint defect using the same assay using the oligonucleotide complex M2 or M3, which inhibits expression of Mcph1 to a lesser extent in comparison to the oligonucleotide complex M1. This indicates the possibility that a threshold of the protein level of Mcph1 is required for the integrity of the G2/M checkpoint.This is the first characterization of Mcph1 in cell cycle regulation. Inhibition of Mcph1 by siRNA is associated with defects in the IR-induced intra-S-phase and the G2/M checkpoints and a decrease of Brca1 and Chk1 at both protein and transcript levels. We propose that regulation of Brca1 and Chk1 by Mcph1 is required for the integrity of the DNA damage-induced checkpoints. Checkpoint defects may lead to genome instability, a mutagenic condition that predisposes organisms to cancer. We, therefore, hypothesize that MCPH1 is a tumor suppressor. Microcephaly is a congenital reduction in brain size greater than three standard deviations (S.D.) below the age-related mean. Primary microcephaly (MCPH, OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man) 251200) is further defined by the absence of significant neurological deficits, other than variable degrees of mental retardation (1Suri M. Eur. J. Paediatr. Neurol. 2003; 7: 389-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Six loci have been mapped that account for this autosomal recessive disease. The genes at two of these loci have been identified. The ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated) gene at the MCPH5 locus encodes the human ortholog of the Drosophila melanogaster abnormal spindle gene (asp), which is essential for normal mitotic spindle function in embryonic neuroblasts (2Bond J.

https://openalex.org/W2004462369,"Hydrolysis of triglycerides is central to energy homeostasis in white adipose tissue (WAT). Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was previously felt to mediate all lipolysis in WAT. Surprisingly, HSL-deficient mice show active HSL-independent lipolysis, suggesting that other lipase(s) also mediate triglyceride hydrolysis. To clarify this, we used functional proteomics to detect non-HSL lipase(s) in mouse WAT. After cell fractionation of intraabdominal WAT, most non-HSL neutral lipase activity is localized in the 100,000 × g infranatant and fat cake fractions. By oleic acid-linked agarose chromatography of infranatant followed by elution in a 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid gradient, we identified two peaks of esterase activity using p-nitrophenyl butyrate as a substrate. One of the peaks contained most of the lipase activity. In the corresponding fractions, gel permeation chromatography and SDS-PAGE, followed by tandem mass spectrometric analysis of excised Coomassie Blue-stained peptides, revealed carboxylesterase 3 (triacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH); EC 3.1.1.1). TGH is also the principle lipase of WAT fat cake extracts. Partially purified WAT TGH had lipase activity as well as lesser but detectable neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity. Western blotting of subcellular fractions of WAT and confocal microscopy of fibroblasts following in vitro adipocytic differentiation are consistent with a distribution of TGH to endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and the lipid droplet. TGH is responsible for a major part of non-HSL lipase activity in WAT in vitro and may mediate some or all HSL-independent lipolysis in adipocytes.

After cell fractionation of intraabdominal WAT, most non-HSL neutral lipase activity is localized in the 100,000 × g infranatant and fat cake fractions. By oleic acid-linked agarose chromatography of infranatant followed by elution in a 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid gradient, we identified two peaks of esterase activity using p-nitrophenyl butyrate as a substrate. One of the peaks contained most of the lipase activity. In the corresponding fractions, gel permeation chromatography and SDS-PAGE, followed by tandem mass spectrometric analysis of excised Coomassie Blue-stained peptides, revealed carboxylesterase 3 (triacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH); EC 3.1.1.1). TGH is also the principle lipase of WAT fat cake extracts. Partially purified WAT TGH had lipase activity as well as lesser but detectable neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity. Western blotting of subcellular fractions of WAT and confocal microscopy of fibroblasts following in vitro adipocytic differentiation are consistent with a distribution of TGH to endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and the lipid droplet. TGH is responsible for a major part of non-HSL lipase activity in WAT in vitro and may mediate some or all HSL-independent lipolysis in adipocytes. Lipolysis in white adipose tissue (WAT) 1The abbreviations used are: WAT, white adipose tissue; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; MS, mass spectrometry; NCEH, neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase; PNPB, p-nitrophenyl butyrate; TAG, triglyceride; TGH, triacylglycerol hydrolase. exerts a major influence on circulating free fatty acid levels and is an important determinant of energy homeostasis and of WAT mass. In WAT adipocytes, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (EC 3.1.1.3) is an 84-kDa cytoplasmic protein that can cleave fatty acids from the first and third carbons of triacylglycerol (1Fredrikson G. Tornqvist H. Belfrage P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 876: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and can also hydrolyze cholesteryl esters (2Cook K.G. Yeaman S.J. Stralfors P. Fredrikson G. Belfrage P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 3Small C.A. Goodacre J.A. Yeaman S.J.

Until recently, HSL was considered to be the principle or the only mediator of lipolysis in WAT. However, gene-targeted HSL-deficient mice with no detectable HSL show active HSL-independent lipolysis (5Osuga J.-I. Ishabashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N.

Pan L. Oligny L. Mitchell G.A. Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although HSL –/– mice have a severely blunted response to adrenergic stimulation (6Wang S.P. Laurin N. Himms-Hagen J. Rudnicki M.A. Levy E. Robert M.-F. Pan L. Oligny L. Mitchell G.A. Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the basal lipolytic rate of isolated adipocytes was somewhat greater in HSL –/– cells than in normal cells (5Osuga J.-I. Ishabashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kreamer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 2001; 9: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In HSL –/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the basal lipolytic rate is equal in HSL –/– cells and controls. In homogenates of WAT (5Osuga J.-I. Ishabashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kreamer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and of embryonic fibroblasts from HSL –/– mice (7Okazaki H. Osuga J-I. Tamura Y. Yahagi N. Tomita S. Shioniri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Kimura S. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Yamada N. Ishibashi S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), total TAG hydrolase (lipase) activity is 40–45% of that of normal mice. Therefore, HSL appears to be responsible for hormone-stimulated lipolysis, but the enzyme(s) mediating basal lipolysis are unknown. We thus attempted to identify non-HSL lipase(s) that may be responsible for HSL-independent lipolysis in WAT. We report that carboxylesterase 3 (triacylglycerol hydrolase; TGH), a protein of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen previously implicated in hepatic very low density lipoprotein synthesis (8Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), accounts for a major fraction of non-HSL TAG hydrolase activity in WAT. Chemicals—Oleic acid, triolein, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, p-nitrophenyl butyrate, CHAPS, and the protease inhibitors antipain, pepstatin, and leupeptin were purchased from Sigma. Affi-Gel 102 (aminoalkyl agarose) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride were purchased from Bio-Rad. Glycerol tri-[9,10-3H]oleate and cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate were from Amersham Biosciences. ECL Western blotting reagents were from Roche Applied Science. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Antibodies—Anti-α-glucosidase II and anti-calnexin monoclonal antibodies were from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada). Polyclonal guinea pig anti-perilipin antibody was from Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flanders, NJ). Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-guinea pig IgG, and ProLong Antifade kit were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Mice—For WAT protein isolation, C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River (Montreal, Canada). For comparison between HSL –/– and HSL –/– mice, we used gene-targeted HSL-deficient mice (6Wang S.P. Laurin N. Himms-Hagen J. Rudnicki M.A. Levy E. Robert M.-F. Pan L. Oligny L. Mitchell G.A. Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and control littermates. Ages were as indicated throughout. Enzyme Assays—The activities of esterase (PNPB hydrolase), lipase (glycerol trioleate hydrolase), and neutral cholesteryl oleate hydrolase (NCEH) were assayed as described (9Holm C. Østerlund T. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 109: 109-121PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to assay PNPB esterase, 34.8 μl of PNPB were dissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile. For each assay, 10 μl of PNPB/acetonitrile were added to 990 μl of buffer (0.1 m phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Following the addition of 50 μl of sample, tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 3.25 ml of methanol/chloroform/heptane (10:9:7), vigorously vortexed for 10 s, and then centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min at 21 °C. The upper phase was collected and afterward subjected to incubation at 42 °C for 3 min. The absorbance of released p-nitrophenol was measured at 400 nm. p-Nitrophenol concentration was calculated using its extinction coefficient of 12,000. For lipase activity, in a 4-ml glass vial, 5.9 mg of triolein, including 50 × 106 cpm of [3H]triolein in toluene, plus a phospholipid mixture (30 μl, 20 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol, 3:1) were dissolved in chloroform. Solvents were evaporated under a gentle stream of N2. 2 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, was added and sonicated twice in an ice bath each for 1 min, separated by a 1-min interval. An additional 1.0 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, was added, and the mixture was sonicated 4 × 30 s on ice with a 30-s interval between sonications. Then 1.0 ml of 20% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) prepared in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) was added. For each assay, 100 μl of substrate was mixed with 100 μl of sample and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C without shaking. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 3.25 ml methanol/chloroform/heptane (10:9: 7). 1.05 ml of 0.1 m potassium carbonate, 0.1 m boric acid, pH 10.5, and 100 μg of nonlabeled oleic acid as carrier were added, vortexed vigorously for 10 s, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min at 21 °C. The upper 1 ml of the upper fraction was added to 10 ml of EcoLite liquid scintillant (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for scintillation counting. For the NCEH assay, 1.17 mg of cholesteryl oleate, including 20 × 106 cpm of [14C]cholesteryl oleate, plus a phospholipid mixture (71.4 μl, including phosphatidylcholine (15 mg/ml) and phosphatidylinositol (5 mg/ml), dissolved in chloroform) were placed in a 4-ml glass vial. Solvents were evaporated under a gentle stream of N2. 2 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, was added, and after incubation at 37 °C for 10 min it was sonicated twice, each time for 1 min, separated by a 1-min interval. An additional 1.0 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, was added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The mixture was sonicated for 4 × 30 s on ice with a 30-s interval between sonications. After sonication, 1.0 ml of 20% fatty acid-free BSA prepared in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) was added. For each assay, 100 μl of substrate was mixed with 100 μl of sample and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C without shaking. Reaction termination, extraction, and scintillation counting were as above. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described (10Rickwood D.C. Centrifugation: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1984: 161-182Google Scholar). Synthesis of Oleic Acid-linked Affi-Gel 102 Chromatography Resin— Oleic acid-linked Affi-Gel 102 resins were synthesized as described (11Hass M.J. Cichowicz D.J. Bailey D.G. Lipids. 1992; 27: 571-576Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Preparation of Fat Tissue Sample for Chromatography—Following intracardiac catheterization, a perfusion of normal saline at 0.5 ml/min was performed for about 6 min. Fat was collected after perfusing overnight-fasted 5–6-month-old C57BL/6 mice. Samples were stored at –70 °C until use. WAT (10 g) was homogenized in 20 ml of homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.5), and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The infranatant and fat cake fractions were collected. The infranatant was concentrated to 7 ml in a Centricon Plus-20 apparatus (molecular weight cut-off 5000; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a membrane with 5000 a cut-off. Fat Cake Protein Extraction—Lipase activity was quantitatively extracted from the fat cake fraction with acetone as follows. 10 ml of cold acetone were added to fat cake and incubated overnight at –20 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the upper aqueous phase was discarded, and 10 ml of chilled diethyl ether were added to the pellet. After incubation for 30 min at –20 °C, tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The upper aqueous phase was discarded, and pellets were kept at room temperature for 10 min. After the addition of 10 ml of homogenization buffer, pellets were sonicated (setting 40; Artek Systems Corp., Farmingdale, NY) and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The infranatant was collected. The residual fat cake was again sonicated. After centrifugation, all fractions of solubilized proteins in homogenization buffer were pooled. The fat cake extract was filtered through a 0.8-μm low protein binding membrane before application to an oleic acid-linked agarose column. Oleic Acid-linked Agarose Chromatography—7 ml of concentrated infranatant or 8 ml of concentrated fat cake extract were applied to the gel (column HR 10/30; Amersham Biosciences) at a rate of 0.25 ml/min, followed by washing with buffer 1 (0.25 m sucrose in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) and buffer 2 (0.86 m NaCl in 10 mm phosphate buffer) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted in a 0–1.0% linear gradient of CHAPS in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, with a 1.0 ml/min flow rate. Fraction volume was 4 ml. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Carboxylesterase activity was measured in each fraction, using PNPB as substrate. Gel Permeation Chromatography—PNPB activity peaks were concentrated to 1 ml in a Centricon Plus-20 apparatus (molecular weight cut-off 5000) and then applied to a Superdex-200 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted using 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% CHAPS. 1.0-ml fractions were collected, assayed for carboxylesterase and lipolytic activities, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Detectable bands were excised for MS analysis. MS Identification—In-gel digestion of proteins was performed on the Investigator ProGest Robot (Genome Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) as described (12Houthaeve T. Gausepohl H. Mann M. Ashman K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Samples of high protein abundance were analyzed by a liquid chromatography-MS system consisting of a nanoflow liquid chromatography system equipped with FAMOS Autosampler (LC Packings, Dionex, San Francisco, CA) and an LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Peptides were separated by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Picofrit column PFC7515-PP18-5 (New Objective, Woburn, MA). Buffer A was 95% water, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.1% formic acid. Buffer B was 90% acetonitrile, 10% water, and 0.1% formic acid. A flow rate 250 nl/min was used to separate the peptides. The column effluent was sprayed directly into the mass spectrometer. Low protein abundance samples were analyzed on an API QSTAR Pulsar Hybrid MS/MS mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX, Concord, Canada) equipped with a Nanospray Ion Source (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) or on a Reflex IV matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) in the reflector mode. Prior to the analysis, samples were purified and concentrated on Zip-Tips (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Spectra were searched against the NCBI (Bethesda, MD) data base using the Mascot software (Matrix Science, London, UK). Protein Estimation—For chromatography, protein concentrations were estimated by absorption at 280 nm. Otherwise, proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with BSA as a standard. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-polyacrylamide gels 10% were run under reducing conditions (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Western Blotting—Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electro-blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in ice-cold 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, buffer, pH 8.3, at 100 V for 1 h. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with a 1:3000 dilution of rabbit anti-TGH antibody (8Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The membrane was washed three times for 10 min with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in blocking buffer. After washing in similar condition, the bound antibody was detected by the ECL detection system (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. Detection of the ER integral membrane marker protein, calnexin, was performed using a polyclonal rabbit anti-calnexin antibody (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) in a 1:8000 dilution. Differentiation of Fibroblasts—NIH 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were seeded onto 8-well Permanox slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naper-ville, IL) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Two days after the cells reached confluence, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 3 μg/ml insulin were added to the culture medium. Cells were studied following differentiation, 6–8 days later. Confocal Immunofluorescence Studies—Differentiated adipocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min, and then probed with antiperilipin (1:10,000) and anti-TGH (1:200) antibodies in the presence of 3% BSA. TGH was visualized by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) and perilipin, with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-pig IgG (1:1000). All incubations were performed at 37 °C, and washes were at room temperature. After immunostaining, coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Antifade kit. Images were captured with a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal imaging system. Lipase and NCEH Activities in Subcellular Fractions of WAT—As shown in Table I, about 70% of total lipase activity was present in the cytosol, and about 10% was present in the fat cake fraction. These fractions are felt to correspond roughly to the coating of the lipid droplet (fat cake) and to the surrounding cytosol (infranatant), suggesting a potentially high biological importance in lipolysis. We therefore pursued lipase purification from these two fractions.Table INeutral glycerol trioleate hydrolase (top) and NCEH (bottom) activities in different subcellular fractions of adipocytesFractionsLipase activityTotalPercentageSpecificpmol/min%pmol/min/mg of proteinHomogenate5442100134.98Nuclear1041.944Heavy mitochondrial55144Light mitochondrial781.438Microsomal2404.471Cytosol378670118Fat cake4878.9685NCEH activityTotalPercentageSpecificpmol/min%pmol/min/mg of proteinHomogenate334510083Nuclear812.434Heavy mitochondrial491.4640Light mitochondrial1945.894Microsomal46013.8136Cytosol221666.269Fat cake3109.287 Open table in a new tab Purification and Identification of Carboxylesterases—Following oleic acid-agarose gel affinity chromatography, two peaks of PNPB esterase activity were observed both in infranatant (Fig. 1A) and fat cake fractions (Fig. 1B). In both fractions, the first peak was clearly distinct from the flow-through fraction, being retained on the column until elution under high salt concentrations (10 mm phosphate (pH 7.5) and 0.86 m NaCl). The second peak contained proteins strongly associated with the hydrophobic affinity resin and eluted by the CHAPS detergent gradient. Fig. 2 shows recovery of esterase and lipase activities from infranatant and fat cake extracts during the affinity purification. Lipase activity was almost exclusively confined to peak 2 of both fractions. Peaks 2 of fat cake and of infranatant also showed low but detectable cholesteryl esterase activity. For example, the ratio of lipase to NCEH activities was 26 in fat cake peak 2 and 162 in infranatant peak 2, in contrast to 1.6 in whole WAT homogenate (Table I). Therefore, most NCEH activity was lost during the purification under nonreducing conditions.Fig. 2Recovery of PNPB esterase, lipase, and NCEH activities following oleic acid affinity chromatography of infranatant and fat cake fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After SDS-PAGE analysis of fractions corresponding to peaks 1 and 2 of infranatant and of the fat cake extract, all protein bands detected with Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3) were excised for MS/MS analysis. In infranatant, MS/MS analysis of the 60-kDa peptide (Fig. 3) identified TGH (GI-16716505), based on on-line nano-liquid chromatography/MS/MS results. An example is shown in Fig. 4 for two of the MS/MS spectra obtained from the 60-kDa band. In both cases, the MS/MS spectra are dominated by cleavage of peptide bonds giving rise to y-type ions, which allows unambiguous peptide sequence determination. The other proteins detected by Coomassie Blue staining of infranatant peak 2 are listed in Fig. 3. Of note, by gel permeation chromatography, we found that the esterase activity of infranatant peak 2 was confined to fractions in the 60–70-kDa molecular mass range (not shown).Fig. 4Examples of MS/MS spectra of peptides (y-series) produced from the 60-kDa peptide of infranatant peak 2, permitting its identification as TGH.A, PEEILAE (TGH residues 331–337); B, SENMIPVVA (TGH residues 390–398).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Following SDS-PAGE of infranatant peak 1 (not shown), MS/MS analysis of 43 peptide fragments of an intensely Coomassie Blue-staining 80-kDa band identified esterase 1 (GI-6679689) unambiguously, with 54% sequence coverage. Infranatant peak 1 also contained a small amount of a 60-kDa peptides identified as TGH (not shown). In fat cake peak 2, only two peptides were detectable by SDS-PAGE, at about 60 and 70 kDa (Fig. 3B). By MS/MS analysis, the 60-kDa peptide was revealed to be TGH (42 peptides, 21% sequence coverage). The 70-kDa peptide was albumin. TGH Localization—By Western blotting of WAT subcellular fractions (Fig. 5), the distribution of TGH was compared with that of the ER membrane marker protein, calnexin, and the ER lumen marker protein, α-glucosidase II. TGH was present in microsomal and fat cake fractions. However, in contrast to calnexin and α-glucosidase II, a significant fraction of TGH was also present in the cytosol fraction. By confocal microscopy, most TGH immunostaining was cytoplasmic. Some TGH colocalized with protein-disulfide isomerase in the ER lumen (not shown) and some with perilipin on the lipid droplet surface (Fig. 6). Lipolytic Activities and Lipase Peptide in HSL –/– Mouse WAT—Lipase activity in both infranatant and fat cake fractions (Fig. 7a) of WAT from 2-month-old HSL –/– mice was about 20% that of HSL –/– controls. HSL –/– mice had no detectable NCEH activity (Fig. 7b) and no detectable immunoreactive HSL by Western blotting (not shown). In contrast, TGH peptide was easily detectable in both HSL –/– and –/– WAT (not shown). By functional proteomics, TGH (GI-16716505) was identified as a major lipase in WAT. In both infranatant and fat cake, the identity of TGH was established unambiguously based on the MS/MS sequencing of multiple peptides covering 52% of the TGH amino acid sequence in infranatant and 21% in fat cake. In both cases, we also observed a good correlation of experimentally determined Mr of the protein bands in question with that predicted from the TGH amino acid sequence. In our preparation, other known WAT lipases were not detected, namely lipoprotein lipase (LPL), lysosomal acid lipase, and HSL. This was predictable. For LPL activity, the essential cofactor apolipoprotein CII will not copurify, and hence LPL activity is not detectable (14Wu G. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11925-11930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Acid lipase requires acidic conditions for activity (pH optimal, 4) (15Sando G.N. Rosenbaum L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15186-15193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hence would be inactive under our assay conditions (pH 7.5). Of note, since LPL is extracellular and LAL is sequestered in lysosomes, neither is predicted to be of physiological importance for hydrolysis of lipid droplet TAGs. HSL is physiologically important in adipocyte lipolysis but requires reducing conditions to retain activity. In Fig. 2, the whole infranatant and whole fat cake fractions were prepared under reducing conditions and presumably reflect the combined activities of HSL and of other intracellular neutral lipases. In contrast, peaks 1 and 2 were obtained by further purification under nonreducing conditions and are predicted to represent the activities of non-HSL esterases and lipases. Consistent with the concept that HSL is the main neutral cholesteryl esterase of WAT (6Wang S.P. Laurin N. Himms-Hagen J. Rudnicki M.A. Levy E. Robert M.-F. Pan L. Oligny L. Mitchell G.A. Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 7Okazaki H. Osuga J-I. Tamura Y. Yahagi N. Tomita S. Shioniri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Kimura S. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Yamada N. Ishibashi S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), there is almost no detectable NCEH activity in peaks 1 and 2. However, peak 2, which binds strongly to the hydrophobic oleic acid-agarose column (Fig. 1), and in which TGH is concentrated, contains a substantial fraction of the total cellular lipase activity. Therefore, a major fraction of in vitro lipolytic activity in WAT is attributable to TGH. Consistent with this, substantial lipase activity has been observed in homogenates of HSL –/– WAT (Fig. 7) (5Osuga J.-I. Ishabashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kreamer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 6Wang S.P. Laurin N. Himms-Hagen J. Rudnicki M.A. Levy E. Robert M.-F.

Yahagi N. Tomita S. Shioniri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Kimura S. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Yamada N. Ishibashi S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To a first approximation, the level of lipase activity attributable to TGH may be sufficient to account for most or all non-HSL lipase activity in WAT. Conversely, however, our results cannot exclude the presence of non-HSL, non-TGH lipase(s) in WAT. Although the esterase activity of peak 2 can be attributed to TGH, peak 1 does not contain sufficient TGH to explain its high esterase activity. The high level of esterase activity in peak 1 is probably due to esterase 1, a nonspecific, 60-kDa microsomal carboxylesterase reported to be highly expressed in liver and kidney (16Ovnic M. Tepperman K. Medda S. Elliot R. Stephenson D.A. Grant S.G. Ganschow R.E. Genomics. 1991; 9: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Carboxylesterases are present in a wide variety of organs and tissues of mammals and are implicated in the pharmacokinetics of drugs containing ester or amide bonds (17Satoh T. Hosokawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 259-288Crossref Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Carboxylesterase activity has been reported in rat WAT (18Tsujita T. Okuda H. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 715: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13489-13494Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first identification of esterase 1 in WAT. Its physiological significance in this tissue remains to be explored. Total lipase activity (Fig. 2) is similar in both fat cake peak 2 (6.4 nmol/min) and infranatant peak 2 (6.7 nmol/min). These results indicate that TGH is the major non-HSL lipase in both fractions. In fat cake peak 2, only two peptide bands (Fig. 3B), were identified, TGH and albumin. In WAT infranatant peak 2, TGH is one of a small number of peptides (Fig. 3A). By gel permeation chromatography, the esterase activity in this peak is confined to the size range of TGH. Furthermore, none of the other identifiable peptides of infranatant peak 2 have known or predicted lipase or NCEH activities. Apolipoprotein A-I is a component of high density lipoprotein and is involved in cholesteryl ester transport. It might thus be expected to interact with CE or other hydrophobic molecules and to influence apparent TAG hydrolase or NCEH activities. However, the substrate concentrations for the NCEH and TAG hydrolase assays are several orders magnitude higher than those predicted for apolipoprotein A-I. Therefore, the observed levels of apolipoprotein A-I are not expected to markedly influence either assay. With this proviso, our results suggest that WAT TGH has both lipase and NCEH activities. These findings are consistent with previous publications in other tissues and other species, in which lipase (8Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and NCEH (20Natarajan R. Ghosh S. Grogan M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) activities were reported for TGH. In HSL –/– WAT homogenate, we detected about 20% of the lipase activity found in HSL –/– WAT. As previously reported (5Osuga J.-I. Ishabashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kreamer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 6Wang S.P. Laurin N. Himms-Hagen J. Rudnicki M.A. Levy E. Robert M.-F. Pan L. Oligny L. Mitchell G.A. Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), no detectable NCEH activity was present in –/– WAT. By Western blotting, TGH was easily identifiable in both HSL –/– and –/– WAT. Given the low activity of TGH toward cholesteryl esters, the predicted level of TGH-related NCEH activity in whole WAT homogenate would be about 7 pmol/min/mg protein, which is undetectable with the assays used in crude homogenate. HSL –/– mice have been shown to have abnormally high amounts of cholesteryl esters in WAT (5Osuga J.-I. Ishabashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kreamer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Thus, the small amount of NCEH activity provided by TGH is not in itself sufficient to normalize adipocyte cholesterol metabolism. In vitro measurements do not necessarily indicate physiological activity. In vivo, lipolysis is determined both by intrinsic lipase capacity and by access of lipase(s) to TAGs of the lipid droplet. This has been elegantly demonstrated for HSL, which displaces from cytosol to the lipid droplet surface following β-adrenergic stimulation, a process that involves protein kinase A-mediated HSL phosphorylation (21Clifford G.M. Londos C. Kreamer F.B. Vernon R.G. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5011-5015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A reciprocal displacement is observed for perilipin A, a protein that coats the lipid droplet surface and that may form a barrier to access by lipases to their TAG substrate (22Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B. Harten I.A. Gruia-Gray I Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38486-38493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Our work establishes that the level of TGH could potentially exert a substantial influence in lipolytic capacity in adipocytes. However, the true impact of adipocyte TGH on lipolysis cannot be deduced from this work. It will require studies by pharmacologic and/or genetic manipulation. Both subcellular fractionation and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy suggest that TGH is present in the cytosol, in the ER, and also on the lipid droplet surface (Fig. 6). TGH has previously been isolated from pig liver microsomes (8Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and from rat liver cytosol (20Natarajan R. Ghosh S. Grogan M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In WAT, we compared the distribution of TGH with that of the ER luminal enzyme, α-glucosidase II. A greater fraction of TGH than of α-glucosidase II was present in the cytosol, suggesting that the presence of TGH in this compartment may not be due simply to spillage. Other possibilities cannot be eliminated, such as nonhomogeneous distribution of enzymes within adipocyte ER and selective disruption of TGH-enriched ER during preparation. Although we have no evidence to support this, it is possible that the cytosolic TGH may be due to microsomal breakage during preparation. Of note, the microsomal proteins TGH, calnexin, and α-glucosidase II were all present in fat cake. Part of this may be artifactual, due to nonspecific hydrophobic affinity of these proteins for the lipid droplet during subcellular fractionation. However, on confocal microscopy, some TGH immunofluorescence is in immediate proximity to the lipid droplet surface, and some merges with that of perilipin, a marker of the lipid droplet surface (Fig. 6). These observations are consistent with a true in vivo relationship between the lipid droplet surface and ER. This has previously been suggested by electron microscopic data showing proximity of some ER cisternae with the lipid droplet surface (23Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and by reports that lipid droplets may arise from the ER (24Murphy D.J. Vance J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 25Meer G.V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: F29-F34Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Caldas H. Herman G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2981-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and of the presence of other ER proteins on the lipid droplet surface (26Caldas H. Herman G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2981-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Prattes S. Hörl G. Hammer A Blaschitz A. Graier W. Sattler W. Zechner R. Steyer E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2977-2989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that TGH, a microsomal protein, accounts for most non-HSL intracellular lipase activity in WAT at neutral pH in vitro, the possibility that ER may be directly involved in adipocyte lipolysis merits further study.

https://openalex.org/W2038543938,"We previously described the use of quantitative proteomics to study macromolecular complexes. Applying the method to analyze a yeast RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex, we identified a new 8-kDa protein, encoded by the uncharacterized open reading frame YDR079c-a, as a potential new component of the preinitiation complex. Here we show that YDR079c-a is a bona fide component of polymerase II preinitiation complexes and investigate its role in transcription. YDR079c-a is recruited to promoters both in vivo and in vitro and is required for efficient transcription in vitro and for normal induction of GAL genes. In addition, YDR079c-a is a core component of general transcription and DNA repair factor IIH and is required for efficient recruitment of TFIIH to a promoter. Yeast lacking YDR079c-a grow slowly, and, like strains carrying mutations in core TFIIH subunits, are sensitive to ultraviolet radiation. YDR079c-a is conserved throughout evolution, and mutations in the human ortholog account for a DNA repair-deficient form of the tricothiodystrophy disorder called TTD-A(2). The identification of a new, evolutionarily conserved, core TFIIH subunit is essential for our understanding of TFIIH function in transcription, DNA repair and human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2063372081,"Arrestin regulates almost all G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR)–mediated signaling and trafficking. We report that the multidomain protein, spinophilin, antagonizes these multiple arrestin functions. Through blocking G protein receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) association with receptor-Gβγ complexes, spinophilin reduces arrestin-stabilized receptor phosphorylation, receptor endocytosis, and the acceleration of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity following endocytosis. Spinophilin knockout mice were more sensitive than wild-type mice to sedation elicited by stimulation of α 2 adrenergic receptors, whereas arrestin 3 knockout mice were more resistant, indicating that the signal-promoting, rather than the signal-terminating, roles of arrestin are more important for certain response pathways. The reciprocal interactions of GPCRs with spinophilin and arrestin represent a regulatory mechanism for fine-tuning complex receptor-orchestrated cell signaling and responses."

During its life cycle, the parasite goes through two developmental stages. The promastigote form of the parasite resides in the intestinal tract of the insect vector. The amastigote form of the parasite resides in macrophages and other mononuclear phagocytes in the mammalian host. Between 10 and 15 million people have clinical symptoms of leishmaniasis, and 400,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Increases in personal and business travel and intervention in regional conflicts such as the last two Iraqi wars have resulted in a significant rise in cases of Leishmania in the United States (1Lockwood D. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 110Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).The pentavalent antimonial drugs Pentostam and Glucantime are the first line treatment for leishmaniasis, and resistance to those drugs is a serious clinical problem (2Grogl M.

We propose that at least a portion of the Sb(V) in Pentostam is reduced by a leishmanial As(V) reductase. Arsenate reductases are ubiquitous in prokaryotes and Archaea and are essential for conferring resistance to arsenate (13Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In these organisms arsenate reductase enzymes apparently arose independently at least twice. Recently, a Leishmania donovani enzyme related to glutathione S-transferases has been shown to catalyze GSH-dependent reduction of arsenate and antimonate in vitro (14Denton H. McGregor J.C. Coombs G.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although this protein is a reasonable candidate for a Pentostam-reducing enzyme, there are no data that directly demonstrate a relationship of this enzyme and drug sensitivity in Leishmania amastigotes.In contrast, the ScAcr2p arsenate reductase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reduces arsenate to arsenite both in vivo and in vitro (15Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 127-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and to rhodanese, a thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (20Hofmann K. Bucher P. Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). ScAcr2p uses GSH and glutaredoxin as cofactors (17Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Because of its relatedness to protein phosphatases, it is difficult to identify paralogous eukaryotic proteins solely by homology searches of DNA data bases. We used the ScAcr2p sequence to identify a closely related Leishmania major sequence. This open reading frame, designated LmACR2, was cloned into both yeast and Escherichia coli expression vectors. LmACR2 functionally complements the arsenate-sensitive phenotypes of the ScACR2 deletion of S. cerevisiae and a deletion of the E. coli arsC gene, which encodes a bacterial arsenate reductase. LmACR2 was purified and characterized. The Leishmania enzyme requires GSH and glutaredoxin for arsenate reductase activity, with a Km of 6 mm for As(V) and is inhibited by As(III), Sb(III), and phenylarsine oxide. LmACR2 also reduces Sb(V) to Sb(III) with a Km of 7 μm. To demonstrate a relationship between LmACR2 and Pentostam activity, LmACR2 was transfected into Leishmania infantum promastigotes. Macrophage-infected amastigotes derived from these transfected cells exhibited increased sensitivity to Pentostam. This is the first demonstration of an enzyme that is involved in and probably required for action of the drug Pentostam in intracellular Leishmania amastigotes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—All reagents were from Sigma. As(V), Sb(V), As(III), and Sb(III) were purchased in the form of sodium arsenate, potassium hexahydroxy antimonate, sodium arsenite, and potassium antimonyl tartrate, respectively. DNA manipulation reagents were obtained from Qiagen and Invitrogen.Cloning of LmACR2—The Leishmania Genome Network GeneDB was inspected for an L. major homologue of ScACR2. The closest to ScACR2 (systematic name, LmjF32.2740) is 384 bp in length and localized in chromosome 32. The full-length gene, designated LmACR2, was cloned by PCR by using 5′-CCATGGCGAACTACACGTACATAAAGCCGG-3′ as forward primer and 5′-AAGCTTCACGTACATGAGGTCTGGC-3′ as reverse primer. NcoI and HindIII sites were created at the 5′ and 3′ end of the gene, respectively, for cloning into pBAD-Myc-HisA (Invitrogen). For cloning into the yeast expression vector pYES2.0 (Invitrogen), LmACR2 was cloned by using 5′-ATGACGAACTACACGTACATAAAGCCGG-3′ as forward primer and 5′-TCACACGTACATGAGGTCTGGCCGCACGTC-3′ as reverse primer. For cloning into Leishmania expression vector pSPαHYGα, LmACR2 was cloned by using 5′-TCTAGAATGACGAACTACACGTACATAAAGCCGG-3′ as forward primer and AAGCTTTCACACGTACATGAGGTCTGGC as reverse primer. Each PCR fragment was first cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) cloning vector and sequenced (CEQ 2000, Beckman) to confirm the integrity of the gene. PCRs were performed in a Peltier Thermal Cycler (PTC 200) from MJ Research. The fragments were then cloned into respective expression vectors, giving rise to LmACR2-pBADA for expression in E. coli, LmACR2-pYES for expression in yeast, and pSP-LmACR2-HYG for expression in Leishmania.Metalloid Sensitivity Assays—Cells from E. coli were grown in a low phosphate medium (21Oden K.L.

THP-1 cells were differentiated with phorbol myristate acetate and infected with L. infantum promastigotes at a ratio of 2:1 for 2 h. Noninternalized parasites were washed away, and infected macrophages were treated with varying concentrations of Pentostam. After 5 days of culture, wells containing adherent differentiated THP-1 cells were washed, and luciferase activity was determined essentially as described using a microtiter plate luminometer (24Roy G.

Cells of E. coli strain TOP10 bearing LmACR2-pBADA were grown in 4 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin with shaking at 37 °C. At an A600 nm of 0.5, l(+)-arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.02% as inducer, and the culture was grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed once with Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m KCl, pH 7.5), suspended in Buffer B (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol) at a ratio of 5 ml of buffer per g of wet cells, and lysed by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 pounds/square inch. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (2.5 μl/g of wet cells) was added to the lysate immediately after lysis. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant solution was loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column pre-equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was then washed with 250 ml of Buffer B followed by elution with 125 ml of Buffer B with the concentration of imidazole increased to 0.2 m. LmACR2 was identified by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing purified LmACR2 were pooled and concentrated. The concentrated protein from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column was applied to a 1.5-cm diameter column filled to 75 cm with Sephacryl S-100 (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with Buffer C (50 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mm EDTA), eluted with buffer C, pooled, and concentrated. All purified proteins were stored at –70 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm by using the following extinction coefficients calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal.

The assay buffer contained 50 mm MOPS, 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mm NADPH, 5 nm yeast glutathione reductase (Calbiochem), 1 mm GSH, and 50–100 μm LmACR2. Reduction of 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide was used to ensure that the rate of the coupling system was not rate-limiting in the presence of inhibitors. Sodium arsenate, glutaredoxins, and inhibitors were added as indicated. Reductase activity was monitored at 340 nm and expressed as nanomoles of NADPH oxidized per mg of LmACR2 by using a molar extinction coefficient of 6,200 for NADPH. The data were analyzed by using SigmaPlot 2000. Each assay was repeated at least three times with two separate batches of purified protein.Assay of Antimonate Reductase Activity—Purified LmACR2 (20–40 μm) was incubated with the indicated concentrations of sodium hexahydroxy antimonate at 37 °C for the indicated times with the assay buffer used for arsenate reduction, as described above (pH 7.5). The reaction was terminated with addition of an equal volume of 70% HNO3 and rapidly diluted with HPLC grade water. An ion exchange column PRP-X100 (Hamilton) was used for HPLC separation of Sb(V) and Sb(III) with 20 mm EDTA, pH 4.7, as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min (27Miekeley N. Mortari S.R. Schubach A.O. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2002; 372: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Sb(III) most likely elutes after Sb(V) because Sb(V) forms a negatively charged chelate with EDTA. The amount of antimony in each fraction was calculated by ICP-MS using commercial Sb(V) and Sb(III), which were nearly completely free of the other oxidization state. The values were corrected for the amount of Sb(III) produced in the absence of LmACR2, which was usually only a few percent of the Sb(III) produced with enzyme. No more than 10% of the total Sb(V) was consumed during the enzymatic reaction. During the time course of these assays and under the conditions used Sb(III) remained in the reduced form.RESULTSIdentification and Cloning of LmACR2—The Leishmania Genome Network GeneDB (www.genedb.org/) contains one L. major sequence (systemic name LmjF32.2740) for an ScAcr2p homologue that is located in chromosome 32. PCR was performed with 5′ forward and 3′ reverse gene-specific primers, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” to produce a single fragment that was cloned and sequenced, giving rise to a 384-bp gene that we designate LmACR2 (GenBank™ accession number AY567836). LmACR2 and ScAcr2p are similar in size and mass. LmACR2 has 127 residues with a mass of 14,493 Da compared with ScAcr2p, which has 130 residues and a mass of 14,883 Da. ScAcr2p has an active site cysteine within the sequence FHC(X)5R (16Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34738-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and LmACR2 has the same FHC(X)5R motif. The two proteins exhibit 28% sequence identity and 44% similarity (Fig. 1).Expression of LmACR2 Functionally Complements the Arsenate-sensitive Phenotype of an Arsenate Reductase Deletion of E. coli—LmACR2 was cloned behind the arabinose promoter in plasmid pBAD-Myc-HisA with a C-terminal 6-histidine tag. ACR2 genes from either S. cerevisiae (ScACR2) or L. major (LmACR2) with 6 histidine codons at the 3′ end of the genes restored arsenate resistance in the E. coli arsC deletion strain WC3110 (17Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). LmACR2 complemented better than ScACR2, perhaps because of improved solubility. There was no complementation with either gene in the absence of arabinose. LmACR2 functionally complemented the As(V) sensitivity of an acr2Δ strain of S. cerevisiae (data not shown). Neither E. coli nor S. cerevisiae exhibited sensitivity to Sb(V) (data not shown).Fig. 2LmACR2 confers arsenate resistance in E. coli. Arsenate resistance in E. coli was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures”: •, W3110 (wild type); ○, WC3110 pBAD/Myc-HisA; ▪, WC3110 pBAD-LmACR2 + 0.2% arabinose; □, WC3110 pBAD-LmACR2 (uninduced); ▾, WC3110 pBAD-ScACR2 + 0.2% arabinose; ▿, WC3110 pBAD-ScACR2 (uninduced).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Purification of LmACR2—When expressed in E. coli, LmACR2 is a soluble cytosolic protein that was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. The molecular mass of purified LmACR2 was determined by gel filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S-100 column (Fig. 3). From the nucleotide sequence of the LmACR2 gene with the C-terminal myc epitope and 6-histidine tag, the gene product has a predicted mass 17,454 Da. From gel filtration, a mass of ∼17 kDa was determined, consistent with a monomer. In contrast, yeast ScAcr2p elutes as a homodimer (17Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Purification and aggregation state of LmACR2. LmACR2 was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mass of LmACR2 was determined from its elution position (arrow) on Sephacryl S-100 chromatography. The elution positions of the standard proteins are indicated for albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (46 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (14.3 kDa). Inset, samples of each step of purification were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Lane 1, 50 μg of cells of E. coli strain WC3110 pBAD-LmACR2 induced with 0.2% arabinose; lane 2, 50 μg of inclusion bodies; lane 3, 100 μg of cytosol; lane 4–6, 25, 62, and 125 μg of pooled LmACR2-containing fractions from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)LmACR2 Is an Arsenate Reductase—The ability of LmACR2 to reduce arsenate to arsenite was examined by using a coupled assay developed for ArsC and ScAcr2p (17Mukhopadhyay R.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Reduction of arsenate was catalyzed by LmACR2 in the presence of Grx2, the most effective E. coli glutaredoxin for ArsC (25Shi J. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36039-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Both yeast ScGrx1p and the E. coli Grx2 could serve as electron donor for LmACR2 activity (Fig. 5). With Grx2 the Km for arsenate was 6 mm, compared with 10 mm with ScGrx1p. The Vmax was ∼10 nmol/mg/min with both glutaredoxins. LmACR2 exhibited hyperbolic kinetics (Fig. 5), in contrast to the yeast ScAcr2p, which shows sigmoidal kinetics and an apparent Hill coefficient of 2.7 (17Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The effect of trivalent metalloids on arsenate reductase activity was examined. Inorganic As(III) inhibited with an apparent Ki of 0.25 mm (Fig. 6A). The organic arsenical phenylarsine oxide and inorganic Sb(III) were better inhibitors, with apparent Ki values of ∼20 μm (Fig. 6, B and C). Sodium phosphate, nitrate, and sulfate did not inhibit LmACR2 arsenate reductase activity in vitro (data not shown).Fig. 4Arsenate reductase activity of purified LmACR2. The arsenate reductase activity of LmACR2 was assayed with 1 mm GSH and 20 mm sodium arsenate. Arsenate reductase activity was estimated from the oxidation of NADPH measured at 340 nm, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ○, 100 μm LmACR2; ▿, 100 μm purified E. coli Grx2; □, 100 μm LmACR2 + Grx2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Glutaredoxin supports arsenate reductase activity of purified LmACR2.

The rate of arsenate reductase activity was estimated from the oxidation of NADPH measured at 340 nm at each concentration of sodium arsenate, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The error bars represent the standard deviations from two independent assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Inhibition of arsenate reductase activity by trivalent metalloids. Arsenate reductase at 20 mm (•) and 40 mm (○) of sodium arsenate was assayed in the presence of indicated concentrations of inhibitors. The inhibitors were sodium arsenite (A), phenyl arsine oxide (B), and potassium antimonyl tartrate (C). Solid lines represent best fits of the data using Sigma Plot 2000. Ki values were estimated from the concentration of inhibitor at the intersection of the lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)LmACR2 Is an Antimonate Reductase—Because the drugs for treatment of leishmaniasis such as Pentostam are pentavalent antimonials that must be activated by reduction to Sb(III), the ability of LmACR2 to reduce Sb(V) was examined. Pentostam is the noncovalent chelate of gluconate and antimonate. We used an ion exchange HPLC separation of trivalent and pentavalent antimonials in which the amount of each species is quantified by ICP-MS (27Miekeley N. Mortari S.R. Schubach A.O. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2002; 372: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Purified LmACR2 reduced Sb(V) to Sb(III) in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). Antimonate reductase activity required both GSH and Grx2 (data not shown). The kinetics of Sb(V) reduction gave a Km of 7.2 μm for Sb(V) and a Vmax of 33 nmol/min/mg (Fig. 7B). By comparison, the Km for Sb(V) is 1000-fold lower than for As(V), and the Vmax is 3-fold higher. These results clearly demonstrate that LmACR2 is a metalloid reductase with much higher affinity for Sb(V) than As(V).Fig. 7LmACR2 reduces Sb(V) to Sb(III). The Sb(V) reductase activity of LmACR2 was assayed with 5 nm purified E. coli Grx2 and 1 mm GSH at 37 °C. Samples were digested with HNO3. Sb(V) and Sb(III) were separated by HPLC, and the amount of Sb(III) produced was quantified by ICP-MS, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, reduction of 1 mm Sb(V) was assayed for the indicated times with 40 μm LmACR2. B, initial rates of Sb(V) reduction were estimated from the amount of Sb(III) produced after 5 min with 20 μm LmACR2. The line is the best fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot 2000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Expression of LmACR2 Confers Pentostam Sensitivity in Leishmania—If LmACR2 is responsible for the physiological effect of Pentostam, then the reduction of Sb(V) to Sb(III) by LmACR2 should be related to the sensitivity of the parasite to Pentostam. The effect of expression of LmACR2 in intracellular amastigotes was examined (Fig. 8). LmACR2 in plasmid pSP-ACR2HYG was transfected into L. infantum promastigotes, which were used to infect macrophages. These parasites express luciferase to facilitate measurement of drug susceptibility (22Sereno D. Holzmuller P. Mangot I. Cuny G. Ouaissi A. Lemesre J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2064-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Susceptibility to Pentostam was determined in these intracellular (macrophage infected) amastigotes (Fig. 8). Because this is a wild type strain diploid for LmACR2, reductase activity is expressed endogenously. Even so, there is an unambiguous increase in sensitivity to Pentostam in intracellular amastigotes expressing LmACR2 in trans compared with vector-transfected cells. We expect that the effect of LmACR2 expression would be much more dramatic in an ACR2 knock-out. This is the first demonstration of an enzyme that is involved in and probably required for action of the drug Pentostam in intracellular amastigotes of Leishmania.Fig. 8Expression of LmACR2 in L. infantum augments Pentostam sensitivity.L. infantum promastigotes expressing the luciferase gene (22Sereno D.

Macrophages were infected with transfected parasites, and nonengulfed parasites were removed by a wash. Intracellular parasites were incubated for 5 days with the indicated concentrations of Pentostam. The number of parasites was calculated from luciferase activity. The error bars represent the average of duplicates calculated with SigmaPlot 2000. Similar results were obtained with two additional sets of duplicate assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONTreatment of leishmaniasis is limited by the availability of effective drugs (29Croft S.L. Coombs G.H. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Pentostam and Glucantime are the most widely used drugs. Inorganic pentavalent antimony is rather insoluble, which limits its utility as a drug. Pentostam and Glucantime are noncovalent chelates of Sb(V) with improved solubility and uptake properties than free Sb(V) and with lower toxicity than Sb(III). Despite their greater solubility, they must still be administered parenterally, which is a serious limitation in their use for th"
https://openalex.org/W2086967880,"Eleven intracontinental earthquakes, with magnitudes ranging from 4.9 to 6, occurred in the mantle beneath the western Himalayan syntaxis, the western Kunlun Mountains, and southern Tibet (near Xigaze) between 1963 and 1999. High-resolution seismic waveforms show that some focal depths exceeded 100 kilometers, indicating that these earthquakes occurred in the mantle portion of the lithosphere, even though the crust has been thickened there. The occurrence of earthquakes in the mantle beneath continental regions where the subduction of oceanic lithosphere ceased tens of millions years ago indicates that the mantle lithosphere is sufficiently strong to accumulate elastic strain."
https://openalex.org/W1978679164,"Previous studies have indicated that the essential protein Nfs1 performs a crucial role in cellular iron-sulfur (Fe/S) protein maturation. The protein is located predominantly in mitochondria, yet low amounts are present in cytosol and nucleus. Here we examined several aspects concerning the molecular function of yeast Nfs1p as a model protein. First, we demonstrated that purified Nfs1p facilitates the in vitro assembly of Fe/S proteins by using cysteine as its specific substrate. Thus, eukaryotic Nfs1 is a functional orthologue of the bacterial cysteine desulfurase IscS. Second, we showed that only the mitochondrial version but not the extramitochondrial version of Nfs1p is functional in generating cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S proteins. Mutation of the nuclear targeting signal of Nfs1p did not affect the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S proteins, despite a severe growth defect under this condition. Nfs1p could not assemble an Fe/S cluster on the Isu scaffold proteins when they were located in the yeast cytosol. The lack of function of these central Fe/S cluster assembly components suggests that the maturation of extramitochondrial Fe/S protein does not involve functional copies of the mitochondrial Fe/S cluster assembly machinery in the yeast cytosol. Third, the extramitochondrial version of Nfs1p was shown to play a direct role in the thiomodification of tRNAs. Finally, we identified a highly conserved N-terminal β-sheet of Nfs1p as a functionally essential part of the protein. The implication of these findings for the structural stability of Nfs1p and for its targeting mechanism to mitochondria and cytosol/nucleus will be discussed.

NifS-like proteins such as the cysteine desulfurases NifS or IscS of Azotobacter vinelandii are ubiquitous, homodimeric proteins that belong to the α-family of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; HA, hemagglutinin-A; ISC, iron-sulfur cluster.-dependent enzymes (1Zheng L.

They generate elemental sulfur from cysteine via a cysteine persulfide intermediate that is bound to an essential cysteine residue close to the C terminus (3Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Sulfur abstraction involves the transient binding of the cysteine substrate to the PLP cofactor via a Schiff base. NifS-like proteins are structured into two domains, the larger bearing the PLP co-factor and the smaller hosting the active site cysteine residue in the middle of a highly flexible loop (4Kaiser J.T.

IscS of Escherichia coli has been shown to display tRNA sulfur transferase activity required for the biosynthesis of 4-thiouridine, the predominant thiolated nucleotide in some tRNAs of bacteria (37Kambampati T. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38Nilsson K. Lundgren H.K. Hagervall T.G. Bjork G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6830-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutations in proteins involved in Fe/S cluster maturation other than IscS can affect the thiolation pattern of tRNA in bacteria, indicating that for some tRNA species thio-modification crucially involves Fe/S proteins (39Pierrel F.

Nfs1 of eukaryotes is highly homologous to the bacterial NifS-like proteins and is located predominantly in mitochondria (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 41Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol.

In recent years, several lines of evidence have been provided for a multiple cellular localization of this protein. In yeast, genetic evidence has shown that Nfs1p also performs an essential function in the cell nucleus (43Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). During the preparation of this manuscript, an involvement of Nfs1p in thiouridine modification of tRNA was reported indicating that it mimics the role of IscS-like desulfurases in bacteria (44Nakai Y. Umeda N. Suzuki T. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Watanabe K. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12363-12368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In human cells, an extramitochondrial Nfs1 species was detected that was proposed to be required for the maturation of Fe/S proteins in the cytosol (41Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The cytosolic form of Nfs1 was smaller than its mitochondrial version, a fact that was explained by alternative start codon utilization of the mRNA transcribed from the single NFS1 gene in humans. In this work, we have addressed several functional aspects of Nfs1 in the model organism S. cerevisiae. First, we determined the substrate specificity of this protein and compared it with bacterial desulfurases. Second, we investigated the cellular roles of the mitochondrial and extramitochondrial versions of the protein. Finally, we examined the role of the highly conserved N terminus of Nfs1 for its function, and we discuss the implications for the functional integrity of this protein and for its targeting to different cellular compartments. Strains and Cell Growth—The following strains of S. cerevisiae were used: W303-1A (MATa, ura3-1, ade2-1, trp1-1, his3-11,15, leu2-3,112) as wild-type, the promoter exchange mutants Gal-NFS1, (27Mühlenhoff U. Gerber J. Richhardt N. Lill R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4815-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), Gal-ATM1 (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and Gal-YAH1 (19Lange H. Kispal G. Kaut A. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in rich (YP) or minimal (SC) media containing the required carbon sources (45Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed with plasmid DNA by the lithium acetate method (46Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar). Complementation analysis in E. coli was carried out with strain PK4331 (ΔiscS::kanR) grown on LB medium supplemented with kanamycin and ampicillin (34Schwartz C.J. Djaman O. Imlay J.A. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Fe/S Protein Assembly Mediated by Recombinant Nfs1p—Expression of S. cerevisiae Nfs1p in E. coli was carried out as described previously (47Mühlenhoff U. Richhardt N. Gerber J. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29810-29816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). E. coli strain HMS174 (DE3) harboring plasmid pET15b-NFS1 was grown at 30 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μm pyridoxal phosphate and 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested, resuspended in TS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 75 mm NaCl), and lysed by sonication. The cleared cell extract was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the 35–65% ammonium sulfate fraction was applied to a phenyl-agarose column equilibrated with 15% ammonium sulfate-saturated TS buffer. Nfs1p was eluted by a gradient from 15 to 0% ammonium sulfate and purified further by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S300 column in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl. Nfs1p-directed Fe/S protein assembly was carried out by using recombinant ferredoxin from Thermosynechococcus elongatus as a reporter (48Floss B. Igloi G.L. Cassier-Chauvat C. Mühlenhoff U. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 63-71Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The soluble apoprotein was prepared as described (49Meyer J. Moulis J.M. Lutz M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 243-249Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For radiolabeling with 55Fe, 10 μg of apoferredoxin was incubated with 10 μg of Nfs1p in buffer A (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.6 m sorbitol, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 0.2 mm cysteine, 1 mm sodium ascorbate, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm pyridoxal phosphate, and 5 μCi of 55FeCl3 at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions. Reactions were terminated with 2 mm EDTA on ice, and holoferredoxin was recovered by ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (48Floss B. Igloi G.L. Cassier-Chauvat C. Mühlenhoff U. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 63-71Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). 55Fe incorporation into ferredoxin was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. For nonradioactive Fe/S cluster assembly, 10 μg of apoferredoxin was incubated for 16 h under anaerobic conditions with 10 μg of Nfs1p in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, supplemented with 4 mm cysteine, 1 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, 15 μm pyridoxal phosphate, and 100 μm ferric ammonium citrate. Holoferredoxin was subsequently purified as described above. 35S Incorporation into Cellular tRNA in Vivo—Yeast strains were grown for 16 h in minimal medium supplemented with glucose (SD). Cells (0.5 g) were resuspended in fresh sulfur-free SD medium and were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (50 μCi) for 30 min. Total RNA was extracted by the guanidinium-isothiocyanate method (Qiagen). tRNA fractions were separated from the bulk RNA by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted on nylon membranes, and analyzed by autoradiography. tRNALys (UUU) and the mRNA for ACT1 were detected by Northern blot analysis. The amounts of 25 S and 18 S rRNA were determined by ethidium bromide staining in agarose gels. Miscellaneous Methods—The following published methods were used: manipulation of DNA and PCR (50Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar); preparation of whole cell lysates by mechanical cell disruption with glass beads and isolation of yeast mitochondria (51Diekert K. deKroon A.I.P.M. Kispal G. Lill R. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 37-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); immunostaining and immunoprecipitation (52Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar); in vivo labeling of yeast cells with radioactive iron (55FeCl3) and measurement of 55Fe incorporation into Fe/S proteins (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar); and enzymatic activities of Nfs1p (53Jaschkowitz K. Seidler A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3416-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 54Papenbrock J. Schmidt A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nfs1p Is a Cysteine Desulfurase Capable of Fe/S Protein Formation in Vitro—Nfs1p from S. cerevisiae has been shown to be involved in the formation of cellular Fe/S proteins (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). To characterize the enzyme activity of Nfs1p, the protein was overproduced in E. coli and purified. Because the exact position of the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence was unknown, residue 68 was arbitrarily chosen as the N terminus of the recombinant protein, a position well before the starting point of significant sequence similarity of NifS-like proteins. Comparison of the electrophoretic mobility of recombinant and mitochondrial Nfs1p indicated that the endogenous mitochondrial protein was slightly larger than the recombinant protein facilitating discrimination between the two species (see below). The purified protein showed the typical absorption spectrum of PLP-containing enzymes (not shown). Gel filtration analysis indicated that the protein behaved as a homodimer (Table I). Both observations are in accordance with results for NifS-like proteins from other species.Table INfs1p from S. cerevisiae functions as a specific cysteine desulfuraseDeduced molecular mass47.3 kDaNative molecular massaDetermined by gel filtration.102 ± 5 kDaCysteine sulfur transferase activity (cysteine to DTT)12.7 ± 0.1 nmol s2-/mg/minCystine sulfur transferase activity (cystine to DTT)Not detectableCysteine sulfur transferase activity (cysteine to cyanide)Not detectableThiosulfate sulfur transferase activity (thiosulfate to DTT)Not detectableThiosulfate sulfur transferase activity (thiosulfate to cyanide)Not detectablea Determined by gel filtration. Open table in a new tab In order to characterize the molecular function of Nfs1p, we determined its substrate specificity. Sulfur transferases catalyze the transfer of sulfur atoms to a thiophilic acceptor substrate. Most prominent members are cysteine desulfurases that liberate elemental sulfur from cysteine or cystine, and rhodaneses that catalyze the formation of thiocyanate (rhodanide) by transferring sulfur from thiosulfate to cyanide (1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 55Leibrecht I. Kessler D. J. Biol.

A. 2004; 101: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Purified Nfs1p from S. cerevisiae was capable of catalyzing efficient sulfur transfer from cysteine to DTT at a rate similar to that of other NifS-like proteins (Table I). The pH optimum of the reaction was around pH 8.5, in accordance with other desulfurases (not shown). In contrast, only background levels of sulfur transfer from cysteine to cyanide were observed for Nfs1p, and neither thiosulfate nor cystine served as sulfur donors for either cyanide or DTT as an acceptor (Table I). Hence, yeast Nfs1p is a bona fide cysteine desulfurase with little or no rhodanese activity. Moreover, the cysteine desulfurase activity of mitochondria isolated from the conditional yeast strain Gal-NFS1 (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) was severely impaired upon depletion of Nfs1p, indicating that Nfs1p is the only mitochondrial enzyme capable of carrying out the enzymatic production of sulfur from cysteine in yeast (not shown). Bacterial NifS/IscS have been shown to facilitate the formation of Fe/S proteins in vitro. In order to verify a similar role for S. cerevisiae Nfs1p, a cyanobacterial apoferredoxin was incubated with radioactive 55Fe and cysteine under anaerobic conditions. A time-dependent radiolabeling of apoferredoxin was observed in the presence of recombinant Nfs1p (Fig. 1A). The observed iron binding was specific, as only background signals were detected in the absence of cysteine, Nfs1p, or apoferredoxin (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the reaction required anaerobic conditions and the presence of a thiol-containing substance such as DTT or β-mercaptoethanol. A similar requirement for thiol-containing compounds was observed previously for the formation of Fe/S proteins in mitochondrial extracts in vitro (47Mühlenhoff U. Richhardt N. Gerber J. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29810-29816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Finally, in order to show that the bound iron was in fact part of an Fe/S cluster, apoferredoxin was incubated under similar conditions with Nfs1p, cysteine, and nonradioactive Fe2+, and the reconstituted protein was purified. The absorption spectrum of the reconstituted ferredoxin was similar to that of the native protein exhibiting typical maxima at 330 and 420 nm which are indicative of a [2Fe-2S] cluster (Fig. 1C; 48Floss B. Igloi G.L. Cassier-Chauvat C. Mühlenhoff U. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 63-71Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data show that recombinant Nfs1p functions as a cysteine desulfurase that is capable of catalyzing Fe/S cluster formation on Fe/S apoproteins in vitro. Nuclear Nfs1p Does Not Contribute to the Maturation of Extramitochondrial Fe/S Proteins—Nfs1p of S. cerevisiae and other eukaryotes carry typical N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences, and the majority of Nfs1p is located within mitochondria (cf. supplemental Fig. S1a). In addition, genetic studies have provided evidence that the protein performs an essential function in the nucleus, although conventional in situ localization techniques were unable to detect Nfs1p in the nucleus (43Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For nuclear targeting, Nfs1p appears to use a classical nuclear targeting signal in the middle of the protein. Because Nfs1p has been shown to be required for the maturation of both mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S proteins (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that the extramitochondrial Nfs1p may be involved in the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S proteins, whereas the mitochondrial protein is required for the maturation of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins. In order to test this possibility, we examined the requirements for mitochondrial versus extramitochondrial Nfs1p for Fe/S biogenesis in the cytosol by measuring the in vivo incorporation of radioactive 55Fe into the cytosolic Fe/S protein Leu1p. We used the yeast strain Gal-NFS1 that carries the NFS1 gene under the control of the conditional GAL1-10 promoter that is induced by galactose and repressed upon growth in the presence of glucose (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Cells were transformed with plasmids encoding mutant versions of Nfs1p lacking either the mitochondrial or the nuclear targeting signal (supplemental Table S1). Gal-NFS1 cells showed a strong reduction in the amount of 55Fe associated with immunoprecipitated Leu1p upon repression of NFS1 by growth in the presence of glucose (Fig. 2A). As noted previously, Leu1p levels were slightly reduced upon Nfs1p depletion, indicating that the apoform of this protein is highly susceptible to proteolysis (Fig. 2C) (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In accordance with previous results, this defect in the de novo maturation of cytosolic Leu1p in Gal-NFS1 cells was not cured by expression of a truncated version of Nfs1p that initiates at Met-85 (18Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). This species is predominantly located in the cytosol and not in mitochondria, indicating that mitochondrial localization of Nfs1p is essential for the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins (supplemental Fig. S1d). In contrast, Gal-NFS1 cells carrying an additional version of Nfs1p that lacked the nuclear targeting signal (expressed from plasmid pTT-GSR-NFS1-h6; 43Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and hence was localized mainly in mitochondria (supplemental Fig. S1f), showed wild-type levels of 55Fe incorporation into Leu1p upon Nfs1p depletion. By using the same radiolabeling assay, we next investigated the role of extramitochondrial Nfs1p in the maturation of the nuclear DNA repair enzyme Ntg2p. We used a hemagglutinin-A (HA)-tagged version of Ntg2p as reporter that was expressed from plasmid p426GPD. This protein is localized exclusively in the nucleus (57Balk J. Pierik A.J. Aguilar Netz D.

The sebaceous glands produce a lipid-rich secretion termed sebum that is exuded onto the surface of the skin. Sebaceous glands are found in the dermis of a wide variety of animals, but the chemical composition of sebum is distinct in each species and in some cases, even within a species (1Nikkari T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1974; 62: 257-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For example, adult human sebum is composed principally of wax monoesters (25% of total lipids), triglycerides (41%), free fatty acids (16%), and squalene (12%), whereas the composition of mouse fur sebum is wax monoesters (5%), wax diesters (65%), triglycerides (6%), and free and esterified sterols (23%). Within the mouse, the sebum elaborated by the preputial glands, which are specialized sebaceous glands involved in pheromone production, has a much higher content of wax monoesters (48%) than fur sebum (1Nikkari T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1974; 62: 257-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although much is known concerning the lipid content of sebum, the biosynthesis and functions of this secretion remain largely unfamiliar. Sebum may lubricate the skin and/or contribute to the development of the water barrier. These functions are implied by the role of the meibomian glands, which are modified sebaceous glands in the margin of the eyelid that secrete meibum. Like sebum, meibum is lipid-rich and contains a high percentage of wax monoesters (∼35%) (2Nicolaides N. Kaitaranta J.K. Rowdan T.N. Investig. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1981; 20: 522-536PubMed Google Scholar, 3McCulley J.P. Shine W.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 506: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Meibum forms the outer layer of the tear film and prevents the evaporation and spreading of this film (4Driver P.J. Lemp M.A. Survey Opthalmol. 1996; 40: 343-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Wax monoesters are a major component of mammalian sebum and meibum. Members of this class of neutral lipids are distributed widely among different organisms and fulfill various biological functions including the prevention of desiccation in insects and plants, sound transmission and/or buoyancy regulation in sperm whales, and energy storage in algae and plankton (5Kolattukudy P.E. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Natural Waxes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1976Google Scholar). Wax monoesters are synthesized by wax synthase enzymes, which conjugate a long chain fatty alcohol to a fatty acyl-CoA via an ester linkage. Wax synthase enzymes and encoding genes are known from the jojoba plant (6Lardizabal K.D. Metz J.G. Sakamoto T. Hutton W.C. Pollard M.R. Lassner M.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and the bacterium Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (7Kalscheuer R. Steinbuchel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8075-8082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The plant wax synthase is hydrophobic and is predicted to span the membrane seven to nine times. The protein shares sequence identity with seven Arabidopsis genes but does not have an obvious mammalian ortholog. Coexpression of the jojoba wax synthase gene with a fatty acid elongase and a bacterial fatty acyl-CoA reductase leads to the synthesis of large quantities of wax in the seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis plants (6Lardizabal K.D. Metz J.G. Sakamoto T. Hutton W.C. Pollard M.R. Lassner M.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The bacterial wax synthase is unrelated to the jojoba wax synthase or to other mammalian proteins in the data base but does share sequence identity with proteins specified by several microbial genes (7Kalscheuer R.

In addition to wax monoesters, mice and other species elaborate more complex wax diesters and triesters in fur sebum that are composed of three and four fatty acids/alcohols in ester linkage (8Nicolaides N.

The biosynthetic enzymes for these lipids are as yet undefined; however, mice deficient in the genes encoding DGAT1 or stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 have reduced wax diesters in their fur (10Miyazaki M. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 11Miyazaki M. Gomez F.E. Ntambi J.M. J.

These animals also exhibit sebaceous gland atrophy, thus it is not clear whether the reduction in wax diesters in the mutant mice is the result of decreased lipid synthesis or secretion from the deteriorated gland.

Recombinant wax synthase, DGAT, and MGAT proteins were expressed in mammalian and insect cells and their enzyme activities compared. The subcellular localization of the mammalian wax synthase was characterized and its tissue distribution determined by analysis of mRNA by real time PCRs. Coexpression in cultured cells of the identified wax synthase with either of the fatty acyl-CoA reductase enzymes reported in the accompanying paper (14Cheng J.B. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

Expression Cloning—A cDNA library was constructed from 5 μg of poly(A)+-enriched mRNA isolated from the preputial glands of male mice (mixed strain, C57BL/6J;129S6/SvEv) using the SuperScript plasmid system for cDNA synthesis and cloning (Invitrogen). cDNA inserts were ligated into the pCMV·SPORT6 vector that had been cleaved with the restriction enzymes NotI and SalI, and the resulting DNAs were electroporated into Escherichia coli ElectroMAX DH10B competent cells (Invitrogen). A library of ∼6.8 × 106 independent clones was produced in which 95% of the plasmids harbored cDNA inserts with average lengths of ∼1.8 kb. Aliquots of the ligation mix containing ∼200 clones were introduced into E. coli, and plasmid DNA was isolated using the Wizard® Plus Miniprep DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were transfected with pools of cDNAs using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) and assayed for wax synthase activity as described below under “Wax Synthase Enzyme Assay in Transfected Cells.” Mammalian Expression Plasmids—A pCMV·SPORT6 vector containing the mouse wax synthase cDNA (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession numbers AY611031 and AY611032) was isolated by expression cloning as described above.

After 16-20 h, medium was replaced with fresh plating medium supplemented with 2.4 μm [1-14C]hexadecanol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals). After 6-18 h of incubation, cells transfected with individual expression plasmids were washed once with 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and scraped into 2 ml of PBS with a rubber policeman. Cells transfected with mouse cDNA pools were scraped directly into the medium with a rubber policeman. Lipid metabolites were extracted from the PBS-cell slurry or the medium-cell slurry with 8 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC). TLC—Separation of fatty alcohol and wax monoester lipids was performed as described in the accompanying paper (14Cheng J.B. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

Separation of glycerol lipids was accomplished using solvent system 3 containing hexane:ether:acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v/v). Stock solutions (10 mm) of lipid standards purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. were made as follows. Palmitic acid, stearic acid, hexadecanol, octadecanol, 1-oleoyl-racemic-glycerol, (S)-1,2-diolein, and glyceryl trioleate were dissolved in ethanol; dipalmitin and glyceryl tripalmitate were dissolved in chloroform; and cholesteryl oleate, cholesteryl palmitate, cetylpalmitate, and stearyl stearate were dissolved in hexane.

Cells were harvested ∼26-36 h after transfection by scraping into 2 ml of PBS and then pelleted by centrifugation in a desktop centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was washed once by resuspension in PBS and the cells collected again by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, supplemented with one mini-complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)/10 ml) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The swollen cells were lysed by 20 passages through a 23-gauge needle. Nuclei were removed from the cell lysates by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, 0.1 volume of 2.5 m sucrose, 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was added to the supernatant prior to freezing in liquid N2 and storage at -80 °C. In some cases, membranes were prepared by further centrifugation of cell lysates in a Beckman TLA120.2 rotor in a TL-100 instrument at 130,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Membrane pellets were resuspended in assay buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and one mini-complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml), frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C.

Fatty alcohol and isoprenoid alcohol stock solutions were dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 50 mm. Before use, eicosanol was heated to 60 °C to ensure complete resuspension. Aliquots (15-25 μg) of HEK 293 cell membrane protein prepared from cells transfected with pCMV6, pCMV·SPORT6-mWS, or pCMV6-hWS plasmids were incubated at 37 °C for 25-30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 6 n HCl. After the addition of 0.9 ml of PBS to each tube, lipids were extracted into 6 ml of chloroform: methanol (2:1, v/v). TLC of resuspended lipids was performed as described above. To determine acyl-CoA preference, the above assay conditions were used except 93 μm hexadecanol, 7 μm [1-14C]hexadecanol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 100 μm acyl-CoA were used.

Baculovirus Expression Vectors—Baculovirus recombinant donor plasmids with wax synthase and acyltransferase cDNAs were produced in pFastBAC HT expression vectors (Invitrogen), which encode a hexahistidine (His6) sequence at the 5′-end of the inserted cDNAs. For the mouse wax synthase, the cDNA insert of the pCMV·SPORT6-mWS plasmid described above was released by digestion with the restriction enzymes SalI and NotI and ligated into the pFastBAC HTA vector. To construct a mouse MGAT2 cDNA donor plasmid, the MGAT2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from the pCMV·SPORT6-mMGAT2 template described above using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GCCTATGTCGACAGCCAGCTCAGCATGGTGGAGTTC-3′ and 5′-ATTATGCGGCCGCTGGAGACACTTAGCAGAACTCCAG-3′. The amplified DNA product was digested with SalI and NotI and ligated into the pFastBAC HTC vector. A mouse DGAT2 donor plasmid was prepared by digesting the pCMV·SPORT6-mDGAT2 plasmid described above with the restriction enzymes SalI and NotI to release the cDNA, which was then ligated into pFastBAC HTC. A donor plasmid containing the mouse Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase cDNA (steroid 5β-reductase, nucleotides 48-1053 of GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number BC018333) was produced as described in the accompanying paper (14Cheng J.B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37789-37797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Generation of infectious A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis baculovirus stocks from the various donor plasmids was done in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System kit (Invitrogen). Acyltransferase Enzyme Assay in Baculovirus-infected Cells—Sf9 cells were plated on day 0 at a density of 9 × 105 cells in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates. After a 2-4-h attachment period, the medium was replaced with Sf-900 II SFM medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and cells were infected for ∼50 h with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1-3.

Cells were incubated with fatty acids for ∼20 min or fatty alcohols for ∼1.5 h at room temperature, washed with 2 ml PBS, and then harvested by scraping in 2 ml of PBS with a rubber policeman. Lipid metabolites from 1.5 ml of the resuspended cells were extracted into 8 ml of chloroform:methanol 2:1 (v/v) and resolved by TLC. Immunoblotting—Cell membranes containing FLAG epitope-tagged proteins were prepared from duplicate plates of transfected HEK 293 cells. Cell extracts containing His6-tagged enzymes were harvested from 6-well plates infected with the indicated baculovirus expression vectors. SDS-PAGE was carried out under standard conditions. Resolved proteins were transferred by electroblotting to Hybond C Extra nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). FLAG epitope-tagged proteins were detected by incubation with a 1:1,000 dilution of the primary FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in a solution of 5% (w/v) powdered milk, 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS, followed by incubation with a 1:3,750 dilution of secondary donkey anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Visualization of the peroxidase was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). His6 epitope-tagged proteins were detected following the manufacturer's protocol for the Tetra-His Horseradish Peroxidase Conjugate Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Immunocytochemistry—Transfection, antibody staining, and imaging were performed as described in the accompanying paper (14Cheng J.B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37789-37797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells were transiently transfected with either the pCMV6 or pCMV6-FLAG-mWS plasmid and then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-calnexin carboxyl terminus rabbit polyclonal antibody (Stressgen, San Diego) at a 1:200 dilution and/or α-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at a 1:500 dilution). Cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and/or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) at a 1:500 dilution. Real Time PCR—cDNA synthesis and real time PCRs were performed as described in Ref. 14Cheng J.B. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37789-37797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar. Male human adult skin total RNA was obtained from Stratagene. Oligonucleotide primers used to amplify the mouse wax synthase cDNA were 5′-AGTTTTTGTCTTTTTCCCCTGAGA-3′ and 5′-CTTGCTGCTAATGCTTTCATGAA-3′. Oligonucleotide primers used to amplify the human wax synthase cDNA were 5′-TCTTTGCAGCTACTGGTGAGATAGTC-3′ and 5′-TTGTCCATTGTTTTCCTCAATGC-3′. Reconstitution of Wax Biosynthetic Pathway—Enzyme activities were measured in a volume of 500 μl of 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mg/ml BSA, one mini-complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml, 2.5 mm β-NADPH, 2.5 mm β-NADH, 1 mm ATP, 100 μm CoA, 2.9 μm BSA-conjugated [1-14C]palmitic acid, and 40 μm BSA-conjugated palmitic acid. Aliquots (500 μg of protein) of lysates from 293 cells transfected with pCMV6, pCMV·SPORT6-mFAR1, pCMV·SPORT6-mWS, or pCMV·SPORT6-mFAR1 plus pCMV·SPORT6-mWS plasmids were assayed. Alternatively, lysate (250 μg of protein) from HEK 293 cells transfected with pCMV·SPORT6-mFAR1 was mixed with the same amount of lysate from cells transfected with the pCMV·SPORT6-mWS and added to the assay mix. Membrane proteins (130 μg) isolated from freshly dissected male mouse preputial glands as described in the legend to Fig. 8 were used as a positive control for the synthesis of fatty alcohol and wax monoester. All reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 6 n HCl. Thereafter, 0.9 ml of PBS was added to each tube, and lipids were extracted with 6 ml of chloroform:methanol 2:1 (v/v). TLC on resuspended lipids was performed as described above. The mouse preputial gland is a bilateral sebaceous gland that flanks the reproductive tract and is enriched in wax esters (48% of total lipid content (1Nikkari T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1974; 62: 257-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)). Membrane preparations from the gland were found to contain abundant wax synthase activity as judged by the conversion of hexadecanol and [14C]palmitate to the wax monoester cetylpalmitate (see below). This source of enzyme activity was used in preliminary experiments to identify a solvent system that resolved waxes from other classes of neutral lipids on TLC plates and to optimize in vitro conditions for wax synthesis. An expression cloning strategy to isolate cDNAs encoding the wax synthase enzyme(s) was designed thereafter. Poly(A)+-enriched RNA was isolated from preputial glands, and a library consisting of ∼6.8 × 106 independent cDNA clones was made. Plasmid DNA was prepared from pools of ∼200 cDNAs, transfected into HEK 293 cells, and the formation of wax esters from [1-14C]hexadecanol was monitored in the culture medium and cells by TLC. Several positive pools of cDNAs were identified, and two of these pools were progressively subdivided by repeated rounds of bacterial transformation, cell transfection, and assay until two single cDNAs were obtained (Fig. 1A). DNA sequence analysis indicated that the two cDNAs encoded the same protein but differed from each other in the untranslated regions. One cDNA (GenBank™/EBI accession number AY611031) contained a 272-nucleotide insert at the 3′ terminus that was not present in the second cDNA and which presumably refl"

We have isolated one active compound by ethanol extraction, distribution in n-butyl alcohol/water, solid phase extraction/separation, and several rounds of reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. We have shown by NMR and mass spectrometry that this active compound is a novel saponin, a gypenoside, which we have named phanoside (21-,23-epoxy-,3β-,20-,21-trihydroxydammar-24-ene-3-O-([α-d-rhamnopyranosyl(1→2)]-[β-d-glycopyranosyl(1→3)]-β-d-lyxopyranoside)), with a molecular mass of 914.5 Da. Phanoside is a dammarane-type saponin, and four stereoisomers differing in configurations at positions 21 and 23 were identified, each of which were found to stimulate insulin release from isolated rat pancreatic islets. We have also found that the stereoisomers are interconvertible. Dose-dependent insulin-releasing activities at 3.3 and 16.7 mm glucose levels were determined for the racemic mixture containing all four stereoisomers. Phanoside at 500 μm stimulates insulin release in vitro 10-fold at 3.3 mm glucose and potentiates the release almost 4-fold at 16.7 mm glucose. At these glucose levels, 2 μm glibenclamide stimulates insulin release only 2-fold. Interestingly, β-cell sensitivity to phanoside is higher at 16.7 mm than at 3.3 mm glucose, although insulin responses were significantly increased by phanoside below 125 μm only at high glucose levels. Also when given orally to rats, phanoside (40 and 80 mg/ml) improved glucose tolerance and enhanced plasma insulin levels at hyperglycemia.

Plant extracts have been used in traditional medicine since ancient times for treatment of various diseases including a disease similar to type 2 diabetes. Several hundred plants are known to have antidiabetic properties and a large number of compounds from plant extracts have been reported to have beneficial effects for treatment of diabetes (1Anhäuser M.

The phytochemicals with hypoglycemic activity can be classified as alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides/steroids/terpenoids, polysaccharides, proteins, saponins, and miscellaneous other compounds (3Lamba S.S.

Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino (Cucurbitaceae) is a herb that is widely used in Southeast Asian folk medicine and is gaining popularity also in other countries as an herbal medicine. G. pentaphyllum extracts reportedly have many effects, such as lowered cholesterol, immunopotentiation, as well as antitumor, antioxidant, and hypoglycemic effects (6Li L. Jiao L. Lau B.H.

Ginseng extracts have been widely studied and, similar to G. pentaphyllum extracts, exhibit antidiabetic effects via hypoglycemic properties (12Xie J.T. Zhou Y.P. Dey L. Attele A.S. Wu J.A. Gu M. Polonsky K.S. Yuan C.S. Phytomedicine. 2002; 9: 254-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although several types of compounds have hypoglycemic properties, the mechanisms for achieving this effect are different. There is a growing body of evidence that saponins, although active in several systems, are responsible for modulation of glucose disposal and insulin release (13Attele A.S. Zhou Y.P. Xie J.T. Wu J.A. Zhang L. Dey L. Pugh W. Rue P.A. Polonsky K.S. Yuan C.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). For example, crude saponin fractions of G. pentaphyllum extracts have been shown to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects in rats (8Jang Y.-J. Kim J.-K. Lee M.-S. Ham I.-H. Whang W.-K. Kim K.-H. Kim H.-J. Yakhak Hoechi. 2001; 45: 545-556Google Scholar). However, the active principles responsible for hypoglycemia are not known. In the present study, we demonstrated that ethanol extracts of G. pentaphyllum strongly stimulate insulin secretion from isolated rat pancreatic islets. We have isolated a novel insulinreleasing substance from this extract, determined the structure of four active isomers by NMR and mass spectrometry, and characterized its effects on insulin release both in vitro and in vivo in the rat. Extraction—An ethanol extract of G. pentaphyllum was supplied by the Institute of Material Medica, Hanoi, Vietnam. The parts of G. pentaphyllum were dried in sunlight before pounding into powder. The powder was extracted with 70% ethanol in a Soxhlet extractor for 4 cycles. The ethanol was evaporated under reduced pressure to give a crude extract. 15 g of the crude extract was dissolved in 200 ml of water and centrifuged for 20 min at 3000 × g. The supernatant was collected, diluted with 200 ml of water, and extracted with 400 ml of n-butyl alcohol with a magnetic stirrer for 10 min. Water and n-butyl alcohol (Merck) were allowed to separate for 30 min in a separating funnel. The n-butyl alcohol phase was collected, and the solvent was evaporated until most of the n-butyl alcohol had been removed. The residue from the n-butyl alcohol extraction was diluted with 1000 ml of water. Portions of 500 ml were mixed with 200 g of Amberlite XAD-16 HP (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and stirred for 30 min. The unabsorbed material was removed by filtration, and the Amberlite was collected and washed with water. The adsorbed material was eluted from the Amberlite with aqueous acetonitrile (Riedel-de Haën) at different concentrations (25, 60, and 80% acetonitrile). Chromatography—The subsequent two high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CV, column volumes; DQF, double quantum-filtered; ROESY, rotating Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; KRB, Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; iNOS, inducible isoform of nitricoxide synthase. steps were carried out on an ÄKTAexplorer and the last on an ÄKTApurifier HPLC system (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The bioactivity was located in the 60% acetonitrile fraction (total volume 500 ml). Portions (150 ml) of this fraction were diluted with 400 ml of water, applied to a Vydac C18 column (22 × 250 mm; 218TP152022), and eluted with a linear gradient of 20–57.5% B (eluent A, water; eluent B, 95% acetonitrile) in 4.5 column volumes (CV) at a flow rate of 25 ml/min. The fractions were analyzed for insulin-releasing activity. In the second chromatographic step, the active fraction from the first reverse phase HPLC separation was rechromatographed on a SOURCE 15RPC 16/90 column in a linear gradient of 32–40% B in 9.33 CV at a flow rate of 8 ml/min. In the last chromatographic step, the active fraction was purified on an ÄKTApurifier HPLC system using a C18 column (ODS-AP, 10 × 100 mm, 5 μm, YMC, Germany) and the same solvent system described above employing a gradient of 40–41% B in 4 CV at 6 ml/min. The structure of the pure component was elucidated using 1H-1H and 1H-13C two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. NMR—NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DMX-600 spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe in Me2SO-d6 solution at 25 °C. Chemical shifts are reported in parts/million relative to residual solvent signal (δ(1H), 2.50 parts/million; δ(13C), 39.5 parts/million). Two-dimensional spectra recorded included DQF-COSY, ROESY, TOCSY, sensitivity-enhanced 13C HSQC, and 13C-1H HMBC. Pulsed-field gradients were used for all 13C correlation spectra. 13C HMBC spectra were recorded with a coupling evolution delay for the generation of multiplebond correlations set to 62.5 ms. All two-dimensional spectra were run with a data matrix of 4096 × 1024 points, giving τ2max = 250 ms for the 1H nucleus in the acquisition dimension and τ1max = 200 ms for 1H or τ1max = 50 ms for 13C for the indirect dimension. Prior to Fourier transform, the data matrix was zero-filled twice, and a multiplication by shifted sine-bell window function was applied. For 13C-HMBC, the magnitude spectra were calculated. Mass Spectrometry—Positive ion mass spectra were recorded on an Ettan ESI-ToF electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using a capillary exit voltage of 150 V. Samples of chromatographic fractions were infused at 10–50 μl/min via the electrospray ionization source using a syringe pump. For alkali metal adduct measurements, a 50-μl aliquot of the chromatographic fraction was mixed with 2 μl of 5 μm LiCl, NaCl, or KCl solution in water and sprayed into the mass spectrometer. Insulin Release Assay—Male Wistar rats, weighing 250–280 g, were from a commercial breeder (B & K Universal, Sollentuna, Sweden). The animals were kept at 22 °C with free access to food and water before being sacrificed for isolation of their pancreatic islets. The islets were isolated by collagenase (Roche Applied Science) digestion of the pancreas, followed by hand picking (14Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). The islets were then cultured for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium (Flow Lab Ltd., Irvine, UK) containing 11 mm glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Batch incubations of the islets were performed in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer containing 118.4 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.9 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3 (equilibrated with 5% CO2/95% O2, pH 7.4), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, and 3.3 or 16.7 mm glucose. Following pre-incubation for 30 min in KRB at 3.3 mm glucose, batches of 3 islets were incubated for 60 min in KRB with 3.3 or 16.7 mm glucose and different concentrations of the crude ethanol extracts or the purified compounds. After the batch incubations, aliquots of the medium were analyzed for insulin content by radioimmunoassay (15Herbert V. Lau K.S. Gottlieb C.W. Bleicher S.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1965; 25: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). Bioactivity of Phanoside in Vivo—Normal male Wistar rats (120 ± 32 g) and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test were used to study the in vivo effect of 10, 40, and 80 mg/kg phanoside. In rats fasted overnight, phanoside in Me2SO (2.5%, 1 ml/100 g body weight) was given to the animals orally 90 min before the intraperitoneal injection of glucose (3 g/kg body weight). The control group was given only Me2SO orally. Blood glucose concentrations were measured in blood taken after a small tail vein incision at 90 min and immediately before (0 min) and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the injection of glucose. To study the effect of phanoside (40 and 80 mg/kg body weight) on insulin secretion in vivo, vein plasma samples were drawn before administration of the compound (-90 min), before injection of glucose (0 min), and 30 min thereafter for measurement of immunoreactive insulin. Purification—Purification of the novel compound was guided by monitoring the insulin release from the isolated rat pancreatic islets as described under “Materials and Methods.” The crude ethanol extract of G. pentaphyllum was dissolved in water, and the solution was extracted with n-butyl alcohol. After separation of the water/n-butyl alcohol phases and lyophilization of an aliquot, the major part of the activity was detected in the n-butyl alcohol phase. In the following purification procedure, most of the n-butyl alcohol was removed under reduced pressure and the extract adsorbed to Amberlite XAD-16. The material trapped on the resin was eluted first with water and then sequentially with three different acetonitrile/water mixtures containing 25, 60, and 80% acetonitrile. The activity was found in the eluate containing 60% acetonitrile. This fraction was further purified by reverse phase HPLC. After addition of 3 volumes of water, the fraction was chromatographed on a preparative C18 column (Fig. 1A). The active fraction was further purified on a polyaromatic column (Fig. 1B). The material from the active fraction was used for characterization of the insulin-releasing activity described below. However, upon further purification using a high resolution C18 column, the material was resolved into four components, reflected as four peaks in Fig. 2A. All of these four peak fractions were found to be active in the insulin release assay at both 3.3 mm and 16.7 mm glucose (Fig. 2, B and C).Fig. 2Separation of optical isomers of the active compound using a high resolution reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography column.

According to the NMR spectra, all fractions consisted of two products, one of which was not stable and slowly transformed to the other component. A careful analysis of spectra taken at different times allowed determination of the structure of all components. Comparison of 1H-1H TOCSY, 1H-1H DQF-COSY, 1H-13C HSQC, and 1H-13C HMBC spectra led to the conclusion that the structure contains three different sugar moieties: (a) lyxose, to which both of the other two sugars are attached at position 2; (b) rhamnose; and (c) glucose, at position 3. In turn, lyxose is connected to the steroid-type triterpene skeleton through oxygen at position 3 of triterpene. The tetrahydrofurane ring is linked to the triterpene skeleton at position 17. The tetrahydrofurane moiety is unusual; it has an isopropylidene group and two hydroxyl groups attached (Fig. 3A). Chemical shifts, the multiplicity of signals, and the 13C NMR data all indicated β-configuration at the anomeric positions for rings A and C (3J(1–2) = 3 and 6.8 Hz, respectively) but α-configuration for the rhamnosyl unit B (3J(1–2) ∼ 1 Hz). All three sugars are in pyranose form. The linkage sites and the sequence of saccharides and the aglycone were deduced from HMBC experiment. The HMBC experiment made it possible to confirm the stereochemistry of the steroid-type triterpene skeleton and the tetrahydrofurane moiety at position 17. In addition, the strong NOEs in 1H-1H ROESY spectra between 30-CH3 and H-17α confirmed the β-orientation of the tetrahydrofurane ring. Inspection of spectra taken at different times after solubilization in Me2SO revealed a slow interchange in time between the isomers in peak fractions 1 and 4, whereas isomers of peak fractions 2 and 3 constituted the second pair of the slowly interconverting mixture (Fig. 2A). Between fractions 1/4 and fractions 2/3, the interconversion rate was too slow to be noted under the experimental NMR conditions that were applicable. From the inspection of one-dimensional spectra, we immediately saw that for all isomers, there are no differences between the triterpene and sugar parts of the molecule and that the main differences had to be related to the orientation of the substituents in the tetrahydrofurane ring. The stereo-orientation of these substituents were established from 1H-1H ROESY spectra. In Fig. 3, arrows indicate the long-range NOE connectivities observed for all four components. Fractions 1/4 and 2/3, as shown in Fig. 2, differ by α/β orientation of the isopropylidene substituent relative to the steroid ring. For fractions 2/3, the isopropylidene groups have β-orientation, but for fractions 1/4, that group is located α relative to the steroid ring. The long range NOEs made it possible to deduce that OH groups at positions 20 and 21 for the stable, more populated, isomers are located at opposite sides of the 5-membered ring, but at the same side for the unstable, less populated, isomers at equilibrium conditions. Consequently, the cis-orientation of OH substituents in the ring markedly destabilized the structure. The unchanged β-stereo-orientation of OH-20 relative to the steroid ring in all isomers was evidenced by strong NOEs between H-12β and H-21; OH-21 and from OH-20 to H-13. This conclusion was supported by negative evidence. No NOEs from OH-20 to H-22α could be observed in any case. Mass Spectrometry—In the mass spectrometric analysis of phanoside, a very weak signal was detected for the protonated singly charged compound [M + H]+,(m/z = 915.501, calculated value 915.532) (Fig. 4, A and B). Instead, several intense characteristic peaks for phanoside adducts and its fragments were observed at m/z 937.519 (corresponding to [M + Na]+); 897.499 ([M – H2O + H]+); 879.488 ([M – 2H2O + H]+); 457.356 ([aglycone]+, calculated value 457.368); 439.356 ([aglycone – H2O]+, calculated value 439.358), and 421.343 ([aglycone – 2H2O]+, calculated value 421.347) in addition to several unidentified fragment peaks. The fragmentation occurs at the capillary exit area of the mass spectrometer. It is known that saponins, being neutral molecules, do not readily ionize by proton attachment. In contrast, they tend to yield relatively stable complexes with alkali metals, which can then be detected by mass spectrometry. Therefore this property was utilized to determine the molecular mass of phanoside. The compound solution from chromatographic fractions containing water and acetonitrile was mixed with different alkali metal chloride solutions (Na+, K+, and Li+) and the mass spectra recorded (Fig. 4, C and D). In the spectrum obtained with Na+, the signal amplitude increased about 10 times, and the fragmentation peaks observed without metal ion addition disappeared (Fig. 4C). A similar mass spectrum was obtained with K+, and the metal adduct peak shifted according to the mass difference between Na+ and K+ (Fig. 4D). A similar experiment was made with Li+ (data not shown). In these experiments, the following mass values were obtained: [M + Na]+ = 937.545 (calculated value 937.514); [M + K]+ = 953.516 (calculated value 953.488); [M + Li]+ = 921.558 (calculated value 921.540, mass spectrum not shown). The experimental mass values of the metal adducts of intact phanoside and its fragment ions are in excellent agreement with the calculated values and thus confirm the structure of phanoside determined by NMR. Insulin Release from Isolated Pancreatic Islets—An ethanol extract of G. pentaphyllum increased insulin secretion from isolated rat islets at both basal (3.3 mm) and stimulating (16.7 mm) glucose concentrations. The activity depended on the concentration of the extract. Thus, 2 and 4 mg/ml (but not 1 mg/ml) of extract increased insulin release at 3.3 mm glucose from 12.1 ± 1.8 to 63.4 ± 5.0 and 103.0 ± 15.4 microunits/islet/h, respectively (n = 4, p < 0.001 for both), and at 16.7 mm glucose from 29.2 ± 6.5 to 42.4 ± 4.0 and 94.8 ± 9.8 microunits/islet/h, respectively (n = 4, p < 0.05). The fractions of the purified compound from the fraction indicated in Fig. 1B by the horizontal bar were finally used to study the effect on insulin release (Fig. 5). At 3.3 mm glucose, 125 μm and higher concentrations of the gypenoside were stimulatory, whereas at 16.7 mm glucose, significant stimulation of insulin release was noted already at the compound concentration of 31 μm (p < 0.001). At the highest concentration tested, 0.5 mm, the compound stimulated insulin release 10-fold at 3.3 mm glucose and almost 4-fold at 16.7 mm glucose. These effects were severalfold stronger than the insulin release induced by a sulfonylurea, glibenclamide, added at a nearly maximally effective concentration. In Vivo Effects of Phanoside—Before the administration of phanoside and 90 min thereafter, when glucose was injected (0 min), blood glucose levels were similar in all groups of rats injected with 10, 40, or 80 mg/kg phanoside and in control rats (Fig. 6). Fifteen min after the intraperitoneal injection of glucose, blood glucose levels were increased to 15–20 mm in all rats. However, phanoside treatment (40 and 80, but not 10 mg/kg) decreased significantly the blood glucose concentrations compared with controls (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively; n = 10 in each group). This difference remained also at 30 min (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Thus, at the higher doses, 40 and 80 mg/kg, phanoside improved glucose tolerance in healthy rats. In a smaller number of rats (n = 4), plasma insulin levels were similar in phanoside-treated rats (40 and 80 mg/kg) and control rats at –90 min and 0 min (Fig. 7). Thirty min after glucose loading, the increment in plasma insulin levels was greater in phanoside-treated than in control rats.Fig. 7The effect of phanoside on insulin secretion of normal Wistar rats after loading of glucose. Normal Wistar rats were given phanoside orally in Me2SO (2.5%), and the control group was given only Me2 SO. Ninety min after drug administration, glucose (3 g/kg) was injected intraperitoneally. Plasma insulin concentrations were measured at –90, 0, and 30 min after glucose loading. Data represent mean ± S.E. (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A novel compound with insulin-releasing activity was isolated from an ethanol extract of the Southeast Asian herb G. pentaphyllum and demonstrated to be a gypenoside, which we have named phanoside, having a molecular mass of 914.5 Da. Because in preliminary studies the herbal extract administered orally to mice decreased blood glucose levels, we assumed that the hypoglycemic agent would be a nonpeptide compound that could be absorbed via the gut. This conclusion therefore agrees with our isolated novel gypenoside, a saponin-like substance that we have isolated from the extract. This assumption is furthermore supported by the fact that the crude extract exerted a dose-dependent insulin-stimulating effect on isolated pancreatic islets and that we were able to track this biological activity throughout the whole purification procedure. A large number of saponins, called gypenosides, has been isolated previously from G. pentaphyllum. The gypenoside isolated in this study has a relatively unusual structure compared with the majority of G. pentaphyllum saponins known. However, a quite similar compound has been isolated previously from this plant grown in China (16Shen Z. Wang C. Chen X. Arihara S. Linchan Huaxue Yu Gongye. 1993; 13: 265-269Google Scholar), but no biological activity has been reported. The compound had the same core structure but had an aldehyde group at position 19 and different sugar moieties. Our studies with purified phanoside demonstrated a potent insulin-releasing activity that is both initiatory (i.e. eliciting insulin release at a nonstimulatory glucose concentration of 3.3 mm) and potentiatory (i.e. enhancing the stimulatory effect of 16.7 mm glucose). We compared these effects with a sulfonylurea (glibenclamide) that is known to initiate insulin secretion also at low glucose levels (17Malaisse W.J. Lebrun P. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). At 2 μm concentration, glibenclamide has been shown to stimulate insulin release in vitro to a nearly maximal extent (18Östenson C.G. Grill V. Nylén A. Efendic S. Diabète Metab. 1983; 9: 58-65PubMed Google Scholar). It seems that phanoside at maximal effective concentration is a severalfold more potent initiator than the sulfonylurea. In support of our findings in isolated islets, purified phanoside, given orally, significantly improved glucose tolerance in normal rats. Interestingly, this effect was only obvious in the presence of hyperglycemia. The decrease in blood glucose concentrations after administration of phanoside was paralleled by augmented incremental insulin responses. Thus, it appears that the hypoglycemic effect in vivo is mainly attributed to the stimulation of insulin secretion. The mechanism by which phanoside stimulates insulin secretion remains to be clarified. However, it has been shown recently that extract of G. pentaphyllum containing gypenosides suppresses nitric oxide synthesis by inhibiting iNOS enzymatic activity and attenuating NFκB-mediated iNOS protein expression (19Aktan F. Henness S. Roufogalis B.D. Ammit A.J. Nitric Oxide. 2003; 8: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because inhibitors of nitric-oxide synthase activity, such as Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), was demonstrated to stimulate insulin secretion in isolated rat islets (20Panagiotidis G. Alm P. Lundquist I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 229: 277-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it is possible that phanoside increases insulin release by the inhibition of iNOS in the β-cells. However, this effect is controversial because it has also been shown that gypenosides from G. pentaphyllum release nitric oxide from endothelial cells, which is antagonized by the iNOS inhibitor l-NAME (21Tanner M.A. Bu X. Steimle J.A. Myers P.R. Nitric Oxide. 1999; 3: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); although this experiment was conducted with a pool of all gypenosides from G. pentaphyllum. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that nitric oxide increases insulin release from pancreatic β-cells (22Nakata M. Yada T. Pancreas. 2003; 27: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore the effect of phanoside may be mediated by direct release of nitric oxide in the β-cells. Extracts of G. pentaphyllum and/or isolated gypenosides have been reported to exert a variety of effects, such as the inhibition of inflammation (7Lin J.M. Lin C.C. Chiu H.F. Yang J.J. Lee S.G. Am. J. Chin. Med. 1993; 21: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), anti-oxidant (6Li L. Jiao L. Lau B.H. Cancer Biother. 1993; 8: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and lipid-lowering effects (23la Cour B. Molgaard P. Yi Z. J. Ethnopharmacol. 1995; 46: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), as well as anti-carcinogenic (9Zhou Z. Wang Y. Zhou Y. Zhang S. Chin. Med. J. (Engl. Ed. 1998; 111: 847-850PubMed Google Scholar) and proapoptotic properties (24Wang Q.F. Chen J.C. Hsieh S.J. Cheng C.C. Hsu S.L. Cancer Lett. 2002; 183: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In previous investigations of G. pentaphyllum, Hu et al. (25Hu L. Chen Z. Xie Y. J. Nat. Prod. 1996; 59: 1143-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have isolated dammarane-type glycosides structurally related to the ginseng saponins. Panax ginseng berry extract has been shown to reduce blood glucose and body weight in mice (12Xie J.T. Zhou Y.P. Dey L. Attele A.S. Wu J.A. Gu M. Polonsky K.S. Yuan C.S. Phytomedicine. 2002; 9: 254-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In fact, saponin fractions of P. ginseng and G. pentaphyllum were demonstrated to have similar effects on hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia (8Jang Y.-J. Kim J.-K. Lee M.-S. Ham I.-H. Whang W.-K. Kim K.-H. Kim H.-J. Yakhak Hoechi. 2001; 45: 545-556Google Scholar). In the P. ginseng berry extract, an antihyperglycemic component, ginsenoside Re, was identified (13Attele A.S. Zhou Y.P. Xie J.T.

In conclusion, from the plant G. pentaphyllum we have isolated a novel, biologically active substance with the molecular mass 914.5 Da, a gypenoside, which we have named phanoside.

Normal wound repair is a tightly regulated process that involves cooperation between several cell types. These events require balanced proteolytic activities (e.g. clot formation, keratinocyte migration, and tissue remodeling) and are stimulated by a number of mitogens and chemotactic factors (e.g. keratinocyte and fibroblast proliferation and neutrophil infiltration) (1Clark R.A.F.

Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5518-5524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition to growth factors, certain proteases and antiproteases involved in tissue repair are modulated by heparin (11Ermolieff J. Boudier C. Laine A. Meyer B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29502-29508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin and HS modulate plasminogen, thrombin, neutrophil elastase, and cathepsin G activity by altering their interaction with their physiological inhibitors (12Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11563-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These enzymes modulate wound repair by controlling clot formation and lysis, by promoting reepithelialization and angiogenesis, and by digesting extracellular matrix-releasing growth factors (13Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 427-461Google Scholar). Enhanced proteolytic activity disrupts normal wound repair and causes abnormal capillary morphogenesis (14Montesano R. Pepper M.S. Mohle-Steinlein U. Risau W. Wagner E.F. Orci L.

Enzyme & Protein. 1996; 49: 138-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The syndecans are a family of cell surface HS proteoglycans that function as co-receptors for several heparin-binding growth factors and modulators of proteolytic activities (6Bernfield M. Gotte M.

During dermal wound repair, syndecan-1 is transiently induced in proliferating keratinocytes at the wound edge and in the endothelial cells of the wound bed (18Elenius K. Vainio S. Laato M. Salmivirta M. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), although syndecan-4 is induced on the fibroblasts that form the granulation tissue (19Gallo R. Kim C. Kokenyesi R. Adzick N.S. Bernfield M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 676-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, keratinocytes migrating into the wound lose their cell surface syndecan-1 expression, and soluble syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains are present in human acute wound fluids where they modulate proteolytic activities (12Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11563-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Shedding of cell surface syndecans into soluble effectors is accelerated by growth factors (EGF family members) and proteases (thrombin, plasmin, and matrix metalloproteinases) involved in wound repair (20Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 21Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J.

Cell. 2002; 111: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The enhanced syndecan-1 expression on keratinocytes and endothelial cells normalizes upon completion of the repair process due in part to the action of factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (23Kainulainen V. Nelimarkka L. Jarvelainen H. Laato M. Jalkanen M. Elenius K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18759-18766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whereas syndecan-1 expression and shedding are tightly regulated during dermal wound repair, the physiological relevance of these phenomena is not understood. In mice lacking syndecan-1, a delay in skin wound healing is observed, which appears to be due to defects in keratinocyte activation (24Stepp M.A. Gibson H.E. Gala P.H. Iglesia D.D. Pajoohesh-Ganji A. Pal-Ghosh S. Brown M. Aquino C. Schwartz A.M. Goldberger O. Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4517-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, the role of soluble syndecan-1 in wound healing could not be studied in these mice. The cell surface syndecan-1 extracellular domain (ectodomain) enhances FGF-2 receptor signaling (25Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and the soluble ectodomain is a potent inhibitor of heparin-mediated FGF-2 mitogenicity (26Kato M. Wang H. Kainulainen V. Fitzgerald M.L. Ledbetter S. Ornitz D.M. Bernfield M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The inhibition is apparently due to the low sulfated regions in the syndecan-1 HS, and degradation of these regions by platelet heparanases released during tissue injury produce heparin-like HS fragments that markedly activate FGF-2 mitogenicity (26Kato M. Wang H. Kainulainen V. Fitzgerald M.L. Ledbetter S. Ornitz D.M. Bernfield M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Indeed, both the intact soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain (20Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and mitogenically active HS fragments (26Kato M. Wang H. Kainulainen V. Fitzgerald M.L. Ledbetter S. Ornitz D.M. Bernfield M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) are present in acute human wound fluids. Thus, it is proposed that the soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain may act as a physiological inhibitor of FGF-2 mitogenicity, before heparanases convert it to a potent mitogenic activator by selective HS degradation. Soluble syndecan ectodomains in acute wound fluids also modulate proteolytic activities (12Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11563-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The syndecan-1 ectodomain binds neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, protecting these proteases from their physiological inhibitors α1-protease inhibitor and α1-antichymotrypsin, respectively. Thus, regulation of protease activities in the wound environment may be modulated by the soluble syndecan ectodomains. To investigate the function of soluble syndecan-1 during dermal wound repair, we used transgenic strain lines of FVB mice that overexpress syndecan-1 under the direction of the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer (27Reizes O. Lincecum J. Wang Z. Goldberger O. Huang L. Kaksonen M. Ahima R. Hinkes M.T. Barsh G.S. Rauvala H. Bernfield M. Cell. 2001; 106: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These homozygous Snd/Snd mice overexpress syndecan-1 in a wide variety of tissues including brain, heart, kidney, and skin, and they have soluble syndecan-1 ectodomains circulating in their blood (27Reizes O. Lincecum J. Wang Z. Goldberger O. Huang L. Kaksonen M. Ahima R. Hinkes M.T. Barsh G.S. Rauvala H. Bernfield M. Cell. 2001; 106: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We found that wound closure, reepithelialization, granulation tissue formation, and remodeling is delayed ∼5 days in Snd/Snd mice compared with wild-type mice. We found that cell surface syndecan-1 is shed in response to wounding and that the amounts of soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain are markedly higher and shedding is extensively prolonged in wounds from mice overexpressing syndecan-1. Wound fluids collected from these mice have higher elastolytic activity than fluids from wild-type mice due to excess soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain. Cell proliferation rates in granulation tissue and keratinocytes at wound edges are markedly reduced in skin wounds on these mice. Skin grafting between wild-type and syndecan-1-overexpressing mice showed that this reduced growth was due to a soluble factor. The effect of the soluble factor on proteolytic activity and cell growth was abolished by treatment of the wounds with either a monoclonal antibody against syndecan-1 or by HS degradation, indicating that the factor is the soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain. These data indicate that shed syndecan-1 ectodomain may enhance proteolytic activity and inhibit cell proliferation during wound repair. Wounding and Preparation of Wound Tissue—For wound repair experiments, 18 homozygous Snd/Snd syndecan-1-overexpressing mice and 18 control FVB mice (6 weeks of age) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml/10 g of 1.25% tribromoethanol (Avertin; Aldrich). The backs of the animals were shaved and wiped with 70% ethanol, and four full thickness, 3-mm diameter punch biopsy wounds were made on the back of each animal by excising the skin and panniculus carnosus. Wounds were neither dressed nor sutured. The mice were caged individually until three Snd/Snd mice and three control mice were sacrificed at each of the time points 1, 2, 5, 7, 9 and 14 days after wounding. The wounds were harvested with a 5-mm margin of unaffected skin. Tissues were fixed in either 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight or in Carnoy's fixative for 3 h before embedding in paraffin according to standard histological procedures. Serial 7-μm sections through the entire wound were placed on glass slides. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Animal care at the Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, was in accordance with the institutional guidelines and approved by the institutional ethical committee (protocol number A96-07-043). Wound areas were measured from live animals at day 0 and from the excised skin at all later time points after the sacrifice. At each time point wound areas from three transgenic and three control animals with four wounds in each animal were measured (n = 12 for each animal group and time point), except for day 0 when all wounds were measured (n = 72). Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining was performed on sections adjacent to those used for H&E. Formaldehyde fixed sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in water, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 5% H2O2 for 20 min. For PCNA staining, sections were pretreated for 10 min at 95 °C in Target Unmasking Fluid (Roche Applied Science) before incubating with a monoclonal antibody against PCNA (Calbiochem) at 4 °C overnight. Positive staining was detected by incubating sequentially with biotin-labeled secondary antibodies, avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (according to the manufacturer's instructions; Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA), and diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. Sections were washed three times for 5 min with PBS between incubations. PCNA-stained sections were counterstained with eosin and syndecan-1 antibody-stained section with H&E; both were mounted with Permount (Fisher). Each experiment included controls in which the primary antibody was substituted with an appropriate preimmune serum or an isotype-matched monoclonal antibody. Proteoglycan Extraction from Skin—For Western and dot blot analysis, normal and day 5 post-wounding skin from control and syndecan-1-overexpressing mice were solubilized and homogenized in 50 mm mannitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, antiprotease mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then centrifuged at 1300 × g for 3 min to remove debris and then at 541,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to obtain the soluble fraction. Proteoglycans from this fraction were further purified by QAE-Sephadex (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography and ethanol precipitation. Syndecan-1 extracted into the aqueous buffer was found to solely represent the soluble ectodomain; the intact proteoglycan was extracted only in the presence of detergent (data not shown). Western and Dot Blot—Proteoglycan samples were either blotted on cationic Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by using a dot blot apparatus or run on 3.5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels before transferring onto the membranes. Membranes were blocked for 60 min with 3% non-fat dry milk, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and incubated for 60 min with rat mAb against mouse syndecan-1 (281-2) (28Jalkanen M. Nguyen H. Rapraeger A. Kurn N. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) or against mouse syndecan-4 (KY8.2, Pharmingen), followed by 60 min of incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA). Antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). A dilution series of purified syndecan-1 ectodomain was blotted on each membrane to generate a standard curve for syndecan-1 concentration. Wound Fluid Collection and Assays for Elastolytic Activities—Acute wound fluids were collected from mice by implanting 2 cm long, 3 mm diameter flexible plastic surgical tubing (Norton Corp., Akron, OH) via the 2-cm incisional wound under the back skin of mice. Mice were sacrificed 2 days later, and wound fluids were collected by syringe and centrifuged for 15 min at 800 × g and 4 °C to remove cells. The supernatants were stored at –20 °C until use. Day 2 wound fluids were treated with 150 milliunits/ml heparin lyase I and heparin lyase III (Seikagaku Corp., East Falmouth, MA) for 4 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to degrade endogenous HS in the fluid. Elastolytic activity in the untreated and HS-degraded samples were measured by adding 5 μm (benzyloxycarbonyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala)2-R110 elastase substrate (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Hydrolysis was measured over time at 488 nm with an Fmax fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For syndecan-1 immunodepletion, wound fluids were sequentially incubated (at 4 °C for 30 min each) with 20 μg/ml monoclonal antibody against syndecan-1 (281-2) or as a control with an equal amount of 20 μg/ml of rat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were centrifuged, and supernatants were assayed for elastolytic activity as above. Skin Grafting—Skin grafting was performed as described by Billingham and Medawar (29Billingham R.E. Medawar P.B. J. Exp. Biol. 1951; 28: 385-394Google Scholar). In brief, mice were anesthetized with 0.2 ml/10 g intraperitoneal Avertin (Aldrich) and engrafted with ∼9 cm2 of an epidermal layer of donor trunk skin. Grafts were held in place with sutures and covered with Vaseline gauze and plastic bandage for 2 weeks. After bandage removal, mice were placed on a food-restricted diet (5.5 g of chow per day) to prevent obesity. Healing of the grafted skin was assessed by total hair regrowth at 6 weeks after grafting. Three-mm punch biopsy wounds were made on the grafted back skin of the mice (two wounds per mouse) and subjected for immunohistochemistry as described above. Treatment of Wounds with Heparin Lyase III or mAb against Syndecan-1—Healing wounds were exposed to exogenous heparin lyase III (Seikagaku Corp., East Falmouth, MA) to degrade low sulfated domains in syndecan-1 HS (26Kato M. Wang H. Kainulainen V. Fitzgerald M.L. Ledbetter S. Ornitz D.M. Bernfield M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) or to monoclonal antibody (281-2) against syndecan-1 by using enzyme- or antibody-linked agarose beads (Affi-Gel, 100–200 mesh, 75–15 μm diameter, Bio-Rad). These beads have been shown previously to slowly release growth factors when implanted in embryonic tissues (30Hayamizu T.F. Sessions S.K. Wanek N. Bryant S.V. Dev. Biol. 1991; 145: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or in wound beds (23Kainulainen V. Nelimarkka L. Jarvelainen H. Laato M. Jalkanen M. Elenius K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18759-18766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For coating, 120 μl of beads were washed twice with PBS, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 unit/ml heparin lyase III in PBS, or as a control with PBS alone. After coating, the volume was brought to 1 ml with PBS, and 100 μl of the enzyme-, antibody-, or PBS-coated beads were injected beneath the scab of 2-day-old 3-mm diameter punch biopsy wounds in the back skin of wild-type and homozygous syndecan-1-overexpressing mice. Statistical Methods—Data are presented as means ± S.D. except where indicated otherwise. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Dermal Wound Repair Is Delayed in Mice Overexpressing Syndecan-1—To study the role of soluble syndecan-1 in skin wound healing, we used transgenic mice overexpressing syndecan-1 (27Reizes O. Lincecum J. Wang Z. Goldberger O. Huang L. Kaksonen M. Ahima R. Hinkes M.T. Barsh G.S. Rauvala H. Bernfield M. Cell. 2001; 106: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These Snd/Snd (syndtrophin) mice overexpress syndecan-1 in a variety of tissues, including skin, heart, brain, and kidney, and unlike control mice contain soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain in their blood. After sexual maturity (∼7–8 weeks of age) they begin to gain weight, and by 6 months of age, they are profoundly obese with the males showing diabetes. These mice have elevated cell surface and soluble ectodomain in the skin (27Reizes O. Lincecum J. Wang Z. Goldberger O. Huang L. Kaksonen M. Ahima R. Hinkes M.T. Barsh G.S. Rauvala H. Bernfield M. Cell. 2001; 106: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Because soluble syndecan ectodomains are shed into wound fluids where they modulate proteolytic activities (12Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11563-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and regulate FGF-2 action (26Kato M. Wang H. Kainulainen V. Fitzgerald M.L. Ledbetter S. Ornitz D.M. Bernfield M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether dermal wound repair was altered in Snd/Snd mice. Wound repair was studied in 6-week-old mice, prior to the onset of either obesity or hyperglycemia (27Reizes O. Lincecum J. Wang Z. Goldberger O. Huang L. Kaksonen M. Ahima R. Hinkes M.T. Barsh G.S. Rauvala H. Bernfield M. Cell. 2001; 106: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Wound repair of both incisional and punch biopsy wounds were delayed in mice overexpressing syndecan-1 (Fig. 1; data not shown). Two independent Snd/Snd mouse lines tested showed delay in wound closure. Histology of the wounds showed markedly delayed reepithelialization and granulation tissue formation (Fig. 2), as well as altered angiogenesis and delayed granulation tissue remodeling (Fig. 3). Two days after wounding, keratinocytes from the wound edge of wild-type mice had migrated beneath the scab (Fig. 2, A and C), whereas hardly any keratinocyte migration was seen in wounds from Snd/Snd mice (Fig. 2, B and D). Five days after wounding, the wild-type wounds were reepithelialized (Fig. 2E), whereas wounds from Snd/Snd mice remained open (Fig. 2F), had less extracellular matrix, fewer cells, and blood vessels with an abnormally dilated morphology in the granulation tissue (Fig. 2, H versus G). Later, at day 9 post-wounding, the wounds from Snd/Snd mice had reepithelialized, but the granulation tissue still showed dilated blood vessels (Fig. 3, B and D). Remodeling (e.g. reduction and organization) of the granulation tissue, in contrast to wild-type wounds (Fig. 3, A and C), had not yet begun. After 14 days, wild-type mice had nearly normal skin, with a thin epidermis and organized dermis and hair follicles (Fig. 3, E and G). In contrast, wounds in Snd/Snd mice showed poorly organized dermis, dilated blood vessels, and no hair follicles (Fig. 3, F and H). Thus, all stages of dermal wound repair in mice overexpressing syndecan-1 were delayed compared with wounds in wild-type mice.Fig. 2Snd/Snd mice show delayed wound reepithelialization and granulation tissue formation. Wound edges 2 days after wounding from wild-type (A and C) and Snd/Snd (B and D) mice are shown. Note that keratinocytes have migrated beneath the scab in the wild-type wounds (A and C), whereas only minimal migration was seen in wounds from Snd/Snd mice (B and D). Five-day-old wounds from wild-type (E and G) and Snd/Snd mice (F and H) are shown. Note that wild-type wound is completely reepithelialized (E), and granulation tissue is filled with fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, and small newly formed capillaries (G), whereas keratinocytes in wounds from Snd/Snd mice have not covered the wound (F) over abnormal granulation tissue with dilated blood vessels (H).

Thus, we extracted water-soluble proteoglycans from intact and wounded skin (see “Experimental Procedures”). Soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain in undisturbed skin was nearly undetectable in the wild-type mice (∼1 pg/μg of total protein; Fig. 4A) but was abundant (∼100 pg/μg of total protein; Fig. 4B) in the skin of Snd/Snd mice. Wounding increased to these levels: 5 days after wounding soluble syndecan-1 ectodomains increased 18-fold in wild-type mice (Fig. 4A) and to over 200 pg/μg of total protein in Snd/Snd mice (Fig. 4B). Nine days after wounding the soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain had fallen to undetectable levels in wild-type mice (Fig. 4A), in contrast the soluble ectodomain remained high in wounds from Snd/Snd mice (Fig. 4B). Thus, wounding appears to induce syndecan-1 ectodomain shedding from cell surfaces, and this shedding is more prolonged in wounds from Snd/Snd mice. Elastolytic Activity Is Enhanced in the Wounds from Snd/Snd Mice—The soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain modulates proteolytic activities of human acute wound fluids by binding to neutrophil proteases and protecting them from inhibition by their naturally occurring inhibitors (12Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11563-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). If this process exists in wound tissue, the excess syndecan-1 ectodomain might alter proteolytic activities and affect their role in wound repair. Cell-free day 2 acute wound fluids collected via surgical tubing from four different Snd/Snd and wild-type mice were assayed for endogenous elastolytic activity. All wound fluids tested from Snd/Snd mice showed more than double the elastolytic activity compared with wild-type wound fluids (Fig. 5). To examine if this difference was due to the soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain, wound fluids were pretreated either with flavobacterial heparin lyase I and III to degrade HS or with a monoclonal antibody 281-2 to deplete syndecan-1 prior to measuring elastolytic activity. These enzymes had no detectable elastolytic activity nor did they directly affect elastolytic activities in test reactions (data not shown). Both HS de"

The expression of laminin-1 is induced in mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells upon differentiation into parietal endoderm cells. We recently identified a parietal endoderm-specific enhancer in the mouse laminin α1 (Lama1) gene and showed that Sp1/Sp3 and YY1 transcription factors were involved in the enhancer activity. Although here we identified that NF-Y binds to the enhancer sequence between Sp1/Sp3- and YY1-binding sites, all these transcription factors are ubiquitously expressed and thus are not sufficient to explain parietal endoderm-specific enhancer activity. In the present study, we further showed that SOX7 and SOX17 are involved in the regulation of parietal endoderm-specific enhancer activity of the mouse Lama1 gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that the steady-state levels of mouse Sox7 and Sox17 mRNAs increased in parallel with that of Lama1 mRNA during the differentiation of F9 cells. Both SOX7 and SOX17 markedly trans-activated the transcription of the Lama1 enhancer-reporter construct in undifferentiated F9 cells in a manner dependent on high mobility group box-mediated DNA binding. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and mutational analyses revealed that SOX7 and SOX17 bound specifically to two SOX-binding sites within the Lama1 enhancer, and that these SOX-binding sites functioned synergistically to confer the trans-activation by SOX7 and SOX17. Furthermore, this trans-activation was dependent on the integrity of the binding sites for Sp1/Sp3 and NF-Y located at upstream of the two SOX-binding sites. These results indicate that the transcription of the mouse Lama1 gene during the differentiation of F9 cells is controlled by a combination of the actions of the ubiquitous factors, Sp1/Sp3 and NF-Y, and the parietal endoderm-specific factors, SOX7 and SOX17. Laminin-1 is the major component of embryonic basement membrane and consists of α1, β1, and γ1 chains. The expression of laminin-1 is induced in mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells upon differentiation into parietal endoderm cells. We recently identified a parietal endoderm-specific enhancer in the mouse laminin α1 (Lama1) gene and showed that Sp1/Sp3 and YY1 transcription factors were involved in the enhancer activity. Although here we identified that NF-Y binds to the enhancer sequence between Sp1/Sp3- and YY1-binding sites, all these transcription factors are ubiquitously expressed and thus are not sufficient to explain parietal endoderm-specific enhancer activity. In the present study, we further showed that SOX7 and SOX17 are involved in the regulation of parietal endoderm-specific enhancer activity of the mouse Lama1 gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that the steady-state levels of mouse Sox7 and Sox17 mRNAs increased in parallel with that of Lama1 mRNA during the differentiation of F9 cells. Both SOX7 and SOX17 markedly trans-activated the transcription of the Lama1 enhancer-reporter construct in undifferentiated F9 cells in a manner dependent on high mobility group box-mediated DNA binding.

These results indicate that the transcription of the mouse Lama1 gene during the differentiation of F9 cells is controlled by a combination of the actions of the ubiquitous factors, Sp1/Sp3 and NF-Y, and the parietal endoderm-specific factors, SOX7 and SOX17. Mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells are widely used as an in vitro model to study early embryonic development and cell differentiation (1Strickland S. Mahdavi V.

F9 cells differentiate into primitive endoderm-like cells, and then further differentiate into parietal endoderm-like cells by the addition of reagents elevating intracellular cAMP concentration. Parietal endoderm cells are major fetal components of the yolk sac, synthesizing large amounts of basement membrane components including collagen IV and laminin-1. They are organized into a monolayer by a thick sheet of basement membrane, Reichert's membrane, in the early stage embryo (3Wells J.M. Melton D.A. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1563-1572PubMed Google Scholar, 4Clements D. Rex M. Woodland H.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 203: 383-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiated F9 cells also synthesize and secrete large amounts of basement membrane components, resembling parietal endoderm cells in many of their biochemical properties (5Gudas L.J. Grippo J.F. Kim K.W. Larosa G.J. Stoner C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In recent years, retinoid signaling during this RA-induced differentiation has been well characterized; the action of RA is mediated through nuclear receptors that in turn modulate gene expression. Some of the direct transcriptional targets of RA are known, such as GATA transcription factors (6Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and laminin β1 chain (7Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms regulating parietal endoderm-specific gene expression and the overproduction of basement membrane components are, as yet, not fully understood. To identify transcription factors that control parietal endoderm differentiation, we have analyzed transcriptional regulation of the gene for mouse laminin α1 chain (Lama1), a constituent of laminin-1 (8Sasaki M.

Laminins are large glycoproteins that are an integral part of the structural architecture of basement membranes (10Beck K. Hunter I. Engel J.

Each laminin consists of three subunit chains, α, β, and γ, that are assembled and disulfide-bonded in a cross-shaped structure. Through interactions with integrins, dystroglycan, and other receptors, laminins contribute to cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation in various types of cells. To date, five α chains (α1-5), three β chains (β1-3), and three γ chains (γ1-3) have been identified, and these assemble into at least 15 distinct laminin isoforms (13Burgeson R.E. Chiquet M.

The laminin α1 chain, assembled with β1 and γ1 chains to form laminin-1, has a restricted tissue distribution and is predominantly expressed in epithelial basement membrane during embryonic development (16Ekblom M.

Cell Res. 2000; 257: 298-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Lama1 gene is regulated by parietal endoderm-dependent mechanisms in the early stage embryo. In an earlier study, we identified a minimal sequence in the 5′-flanking region of the Lama1 gene that is sufficient to direct parietal endoderm-specific expression using the F9 cell model system (9Niimi T. Hayashi Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9332-9338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The minimal sequence is 435 bp in length, located from -3516 to -3082 relative to the initiation codon, and acts as an enhancer because it increases heterologous promoter activity when placed upstream of the reporter gene in either orientation. Within this 435-bp region, three transcription factor binding sites were predicted, and Sp1/Sp3 and YY1 were found to be involved in enhancer activity. Because Sp1/Sp3 and YY1 are ubiquitous transcription factors, other factor(s) that bind to the enhancer are required to explain the parietal endoderm-specific enhancer activity. Recent reports (20Futaki S. Hayashi Y. Yamashita M. Yagi K. Bono H. Hayashizaki Y. Okazaki Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol.

SOX proteins constitute a family of more than 20 transcription factors with a conserved high mobility group (HMG) box DNA binding domain similar to that found in the mammalian testis-determining factor SRY (21Wegner M.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Sox7 and Sox17 are closely related and are grouped in the same subfamily of SOX proteins. Sox17-null mutant embryos are deficient of the definitive endoderm of the embryonic gut (30Kanai-Azuma M. Kanai Y. Gad J.M. Tajima Y. Taya C. Kurohmaru M. Sanai Y. Yonekawa H. Yazaki K. Tam P.P.

Sox7 are co-expressed with Sox17 in the extra-embryonic endoderm, suggesting that there may be some functional compensation between them (30Kanai-Azuma M. Kanai Y. Gad J.M. Tajima Y. Taya C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4274-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A genome-wide expression profile using cDNA microarrays revealed that Sox7 and Sox17 were up-regulated during the differentiation of F9 cells into parietal endoderm-like cells (20Futaki S. Hayashi Y. Yamashita M. Yagi K. Bono H. Hayashizaki Y. Okazaki Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50691-50701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to ascertain whether Sox7 and Sox17 might contribute to the control of Lama1 gene expression during the differentiation of F9 cells. We demonstrated that SOX7 and SOX17 specifically bind to two SOX-binding sites on the Lama1 enhancer, and that exogenous expression of SOX7 or SOX17 is sufficient to activate the enhancer in undifferentiated F9 cells. We also showed that Sp1/Sp3, NF-Y, and SOX7/SOX17 synergistically control parietal endoderm-specific expression of the mouse Lama1 gene. Cell Cultures—F9 cells were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes in a high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Differentiation of F9 cells was induced by adding 0.1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) and 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP (Sigma) into the medium. A parietal yolk sac-derived cell line, PYS-2, was kindly provided by Dr. Atsuhiko Oohira, Institute for Developmental Research, Aichi Human Service Center, Aichi, Japan. PYS-2 cells were cultured in a high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Plasmids—The Lama1 promoter-reporter plasmids (-2888/-30 and -3516/-30), Lama1 enhancer-SV40 promoter-reporter plasmids (-3516/-3082), and plasmids with disrupted Sp1/Sp3, NF-Y, and YY1-binding sites have been described previously (9Niimi T. Hayashi Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9332-9338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Potential SOX-binding sites in the -3516/-3082 plasmid were disrupted by using the GeneTailor™ Site-directed Mutagenesis System (Invitrogen) to generate the reporter plasmids SOXA mut, SOXB mut, and SOXA&B mut. The sequences of the mutagenic primers are available upon request. All the mutants were verified by sequencing. To construct expression vectors for SOX7 and SOX17, full-length mouse SOX7 and SOX17 coding sequences were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR and cloned into the pCMV-Script mammalian expression vector (Stratagene). Mutations in the HMG box, which does not affect protein stability but diminishes DNA binding (33Ukiyama E. Jancso-Radek A. Li B. Milos L. Zhang W. Phillips N.B. Morikawa N. King C.Y. Chan G. Haqq C.M. Radek J.T. Poulat F. Donahoe P.K. Weiss M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was introduced into SOX7 or SOX17 to produce SOX7-F52A or SOX17-F75A, respectively, using the GeneTailor™ Site-directed Mutagenesis System. For expression of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of SOX7 and SOX17, cDNA fragments of SOX7 and SOX17 were inserted into the pET42a(+) and pET42b(+) expression vectors (Novagen), respectively. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extract preparation from F9 cells and EMSA analysis for the NF-Y-binding site were performed as described previously (9Niimi T. Hayashi Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9332-9338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear extracts and, when indicated, unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors were preincubated in 23 μl of the gel mobility shift assay buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.6 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/μl pepstatin A, 2 μg/μl leupeptin, and 87 ng/μl poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences)) for 10 min on ice. An oligonucleotide probe (1 × 105 cpm) was added to the mixture and incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. For antibody supershift analysis, 1 μl of antibody was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional hour. The antibody used for the supershift analysis was raised against the NF-YB subunit (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA-protein complexes were separated from the free probe by 5% nondenaturing PAGE, after which the gel was blotted onto Whatman No. 3MM paper, dried, and analyzed using a BAS2000 Image Analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). EMSA analyses for SOX-binding sites were performed in a similar manner by using recombinant, bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins (10 ng) of full-length SOX7 and SOX17. Each recombinant protein was produced in BL21 (DE3) host bacteria by isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside induction and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). Northern Blotting—Total RNAs (10 μg) from undifferentiated or differentiated F9 cells and PYS-2 cells were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.22 m formaldehyde and blotted onto Gene-Screen Plus nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Filters were serially hybridized with mouse Sox7, Sox17, Lama1, and β-actin as a probe. Hybridization was performed in PerfectHyb™ hybridization solution (Toyobo) at 68 °C for 3 h. The membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0)) containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min and twice with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 20 min and then analyzed using a BAS2000 Image Analyzer (Fuji Film). Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Cells in 24-well plates at 50-70% confluency were transfected using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) with 200 ng of reporter plasmid and 10 ng of the Renilla luciferase expression vector phRL-null (Promega) as an internal control. In trans-activation assays, 100 ng of reporter plasmid, 100 ng of expression plasmid, and 10 ng of the Renilla luciferase expression vector phRL-null were co-transfected. Forty eight hours later, the cells were harvested in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and the lysates were assayed for luciferase activity by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Firefly luciferase activities of various mouse Lama1 enhancer constructs were normalized to that of the Renilla luciferase and were expressed based on the activity of the pGL3 promoter plasmid as 1. Data are expressed as the mean values ± S.D. of at least three experiments (duplicate samples). The Transcription Factor NF-Y Binds to the Lama1 Enhancer Element—Previously, we identified a 435-bp region, which confers parietal endoderm-specific enhancer activity, at 3.5 kb upstream of the mouse Lama1 transcription start site, and we identified three protein-binding sites (PBS2, PBS3, and PBS4) in the 435-bp region (schematically presented as Fig. 1A) (9Niimi T. Hayashi Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9332-9338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have also shown that Sp1/Sp3 and YY1 transcription factors bind to PBS2 and PBS4, respectively. However, a factor that binds to PBS3 remained to be determined. A data base search for potential binding proteins to PBS3 (core sequences are CCATCCTATAG) using a lower stringency indicated that PBS3 resembles the consensus binding motif for the CCAAT box-binding proteins (34Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Possible binding of several CCAAT box-binding proteins, C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein), NF-Y/CBF (CCAAT-binding factor), CTF/NF-1 (CCAAT transcription factor), and CDP (CCAAT displacement protein), to PBS3 was examined by EMSA combined with oligonucleotide competition and antibody supershift assays (Fig. 1B and data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1B, competitor oligonucleotide with an authentic NF-Y-binding motif abolished protein binding to PBS3, whereas those with mutations in the NF-Y motif did not. Antibody to the NF-YB subunit produced supershifted complex formation. Thus, the protein binding to PBS3 was identified as the NF-Y transcription factor. Disruption of these protein-binding sites by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in a marked reduction in enhancer activity (Fig. 1C). Identification of Parietal Endoderm-specific Transcription Factors for Activation of Lama1 Enhancer—The expression of Sp1/Sp3, YY1, and NF-Y is ubiquitous and not unique to parietal endoderm cells, suggesting that other factor(s) may be required to regulate the parietal endoderm-specific gene expression. We have recently shown that SOX7 and SOX17 were highly expressed in differentiated F9 cells in microarray analyses (20Futaki S. Hayashi Y. Yamashita M. Yagi K. Bono H. Hayashizaki Y. Okazaki Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50691-50701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Time course analyses of the gene expression profiles during F9 differentiation showed that up-regulation of these transcription factors was associated with those of basement membrane components, suggesting that they play important roles in the specification of parietal endoderm cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that SOX7 and SOX17 are responsible for parietal endoderm-specific expression of the Lama1 gene. To test this possibility, we initially examined mRNA expression of Sox7 and Sox17 genes in undifferentiated and differentiated F9 cells. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from undifferentiated F9 cells detected little or no transcripts of Sox7 and Sox17 as well as of Lama1 (Fig. 2). However, the intensity of these transcripts increased markedly after the differentiation of F9 cells and parietal yolk sac-derived PYS-2 cells. As other investigators have reported, multiple transcripts were observed for SOX17, and the most abundant transcript exhibiting a size of 2.8 kb was likely an authentic form (35Kanai Y. Kanai-Azuma M. Noce T. Saido T.C. Shiroishi T. Hayashi Y. Yazaki K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that expression of Lama1 correlated with high levels of SOX7 and SOX17 RNAs in parietal endoderm cells. Next, we examined whether the exogenous expression of SOX7 and SOX17 drives the Lama1 enhancer activity in un-differentiated F9 cells. When expression plasmids for these transcription factors were co-transfected with the Lama1 -3516/-3082 reporter plasmid, both SOX7 and SOX17 increased the transcriptional activity of the Lama1 enhancer (Fig. 3A). This activation was dose-dependent, as increasing amounts of SOX7 and SOX17 augmented the trans-activity of the Lama1 enhancer. This trans-activation was not observed in NIH/3T3 or HeLa cells (data not shown), suggesting that SOX7 and SOX17 up-regulate the Lama1 enhancer activity in a cell type-dependent manner. We further analyzed the involvement of HMG box-mediated DNA binding on trans-activation by introducing an amino acid substitution into SOX7 or SOX17, because SOX proteins bind DNA through their HMG boxes. Because substitution of phenylalanine at amino acid 12 in the HMG box in Sry has been reported to diminish DNA binding without affecting protein folding or stability (33Ukiyama E. Jancso-Radek A. Li B. Milos L. Zhang W. Phillips N.B. Morikawa N. King C.Y. Chan G. Haqq C.M. Radek J.T. Poulat F. Donahoe P.K. Weiss M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), homologous substitution was introduced into SOX7 or SOX17 to produce SOX7-F52A or SOX17-F75A. In contrast to SOX7 or SOX17, SOX7-F52A or SOX17-F75A marginally, if at all, activated the Lama1 -3516/-3082 reporter (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrated that HMG boxes in SOX7 and SOX17 are essential for trans-activation of the Lama1 enhancer. SOX7 and SOX17 Bind to the Lama1 Enhancer Sequence—SOX proteins contain HMG domains that bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. These proteins have been reported to bind in vivo and in vitro to sites with a core motif resembling (A/T)(A/T)CAA(A/T)G (36Mertin S. McDowall S.G. Harley V.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that SOX7 and SOX17 bind to AACAAT or GACAAT sequences (31Taniguchi K. Hiraoka Y. Ogawa M. Sakai Y. Kido S. Aiso S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35Kanai Y. Kanai-Azuma M. Noce T. Saido T.C. Shiroishi T. Hayashi Y. Yazaki K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 36Mertin S. McDowall S.G. Harley V.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Because the Lama1 enhancer contains three GACAAT sequences at positions -3349, -3295, and -3246, we performed an EMSA with oligonucleotides spanning putative SOX-binding sites to investigate whether SOX7 and SOX17 proteins bind to these sequences (Fig. 4). Both SOX7 and SOX17 bound to two of the putative SOX-binding sites (at positions -3295 and -3246, designated as SOXA and SOXB, respectively) but not to the site at position -3349 (Fig. 4C). The protein-DNA complexes in SOXA and SOXB sites were displaced by the addition of 100- and 500-fold excesses, respectively, of unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotides but not by mutated oligonucleotides. These results indicated that both SOX7 and SOX17 bind in a sequence-specific manner to SOXA and SOXB sites. Contribution of Individual Elements to Enhancer Activity—To confirm the functional relationship between the two SOX-binding sites and Lama1 enhancer activity, mutations were introduced into the SOX-binding sites of the -3516/-3082 reporter construct (Fig. 5A). Disruption of the SOXA or SOXB sites by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in a 4- or 2-fold, respectively, reduction of transcriptional activity in undifferentiated F9 cells under the expression of SOX7 or SOX17 (Fig. 5B, left). When both binding sites were mutated, trans-activation by SOX7 or SOX17 was completely abolished. Similar results were obtained with differentiated F9 and PYS-2 cells that express endogenous SOX7 and SOX17 (Fig. 5C, left). These results demonstrated that the SOXA and SOXB sites in the Lama1 enhancer are required for the transcriptional activation by SOX7 or SOX17. We next examined whether the binding sites of ubiquitous transcription factors (Sp1/Sp3, NF-Y, and YY1) contribute to the trans-activation of the Lama1 enhancer by SOX7 or SOX17. Mutations in the Sp1/Sp3 and NF-Y-binding sites significantly reduced trans-activation (Fig. 5B, right). In contrast, mutations in the YY1-binding site had little effect on trans-activation. The functional importance of these transcription factor-binding sites was also confirmed by transfection into differentiated F9 and PYS-2 cells (Fig. 5C, right). Taken together, it was concluded that Sp1/Sp3, NF-Y, and SOX7/SOX17 act synergistically on the Lama1 enhancer to confer parietal endoderm-specific expression of the mouse Lama1 gene. In the present study, we demonstrated that SOX7 or SOX17 specifically bind and activate parietal endoderm-specific enhancers of the Lama1 gene, the products of which are then incorporated into laminin-1 heterotrimer constituting basement membranes in embryos as well as into Reichert's membrane. Members of the Sox gene family share similar DNA binding specificity, especially within the same group. Sox7 and Sox17 belong to the Sox subgroup F with Sox18 (21Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Among these, the RNA levels of Sox7 and Sox17 increase in parallel with the Lama1 RNA level during differentiation of F9 cells in Northern analysis (see Fig. 2). In contrast, Sox18 expression is not up-regulated during this period. 2S. Futaki and Y. Hayashi, unpublished observations. Sox7 and Sox17 have similar spatiotemporal expression patterns in the extra-embryonic endoderm (30Kanai-Azuma M. Kanai Y. Gad J.M. Tajima Y. Taya C. Kurohmaru M. Sanai Y. Yonekawa H. Yazaki K. Tam P.P. Hayashi Y. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 2367-2379PubMed Google Scholar). In Sox17-null mutant embryos, no early developmental defects are found in the extra-embryonic endoderm, suggesting that there may be functional compensation by Sox7 (30Kanai-Azuma M. Kanai Y. Gad J.M. Tajima Y. Taya C. Kurohmaru M. Sanai Y. Yonekawa H. Yazaki K. Tam P.P. Hayashi Y. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 2367-2379PubMed Google Scholar). In parietal yolk sac-derived PYS-2 cells, both Sox7 and Sox17 RNAs were highly expressed in association with the high expression levels of Lama1 RNA. These observations support the possibility that Sox7 and Sox17 may play important roles in the specification of parietal endoderm cells. An earlier study of ours demonstrated that Sp1/Sp3 and YY1 transcription factors were involved in Lama1 enhancer activity (9Niimi T. Hayashi Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9332-9338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here we identified that another transcription factor, NF-Y, binds to the protein-binding site (PBS) 3 within the Lama1 enhancer. NF-Y is a ubiquitous heteromeric transcription factor, composed of three subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC, which are all necessary for DNA binding (37Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 38Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 39Matuoka K. Yu Chen K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although NF-Y is unable to activate transcription on its own, it increases the activity of neighboring enhancer motifs as well as participating in the correct positioning of other transcription factors. For example, the cooperative interactions of NF-Y and Sp1 have been shown to be responsible for the up-regulation of the expression of the major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant chain gene (40Wright K.L. Moore T.L. Vilen B.J. Brown A.M. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20978-20986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Additionally, interactions between NF-Y and Sp1 have been reported in promoter regions of various genes (41Roder K.H. Wolf S.S. Schweizer M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 42Yamada K. Tanaka T. Miyamoto K. Noguchi T. J. Biol.

J. 2003; 374: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our mutational analysis revealed that both Sp1/Sp3 and NF-Y-binding sites synergistically confer Lama1 enhancer activity, suggesting that Sp1/Sp3 and NF-Y bind cooperatively to the Lama1 enhancer. In general, SOX proteins interact with DNA through their HMG domains and recognize short 6-bp core DNA sequences (22Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). SOX proteins have a relatively low affinity for DNA (a dissociation constant of 10-8-10-9min vitro) and thus are thought to be unable to activate a target promoter in vivo unless tightly tethered to DNA through protein-protein interactions (22Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors have been identified to interact with SOX proteins, either to activate or to repress transcription of target genes (22Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 23Wilson M. Koopman P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Our EMSA experiments showed that SOX7 and SOX17 bind as a monomer, although the DNA binding was relatively low affinity in nature, which may have accounted for our failure to identify the SOX-binding sites by EMSA-based screening using nuclear extracts of F9 cells in our earlier study (9Niimi T. Hayashi Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9332-9338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the binding of SOX7 and SOX17 to these sites is of physiological relevance, because disruption of the SOX-binding sites abrogated the Lama1 enhancer activity. Moreover, the mutation in HMG boxes diminishing DNA binding in SOX7 and SOX17 also abrogated trans-activation of the enhancer. Because our data from a mutagenesis experiment showed that trans-activation of the Lama1 enhancer by SOX7 and SOX17 was Sp1/Sp3 or NF-Y-binding site-dependent, SOX7 or SOX17 may form multiprotein complexes with Sp1/Sp3 and NF-Y on the Lama1 enhancer in vivo. Recently, Hosking et al. (45Hosking B.M. Wang S.C. Downes M. Koopman P. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5314-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) characterized VCAM-1 as a target gene of Sox18, the other member of the Sox subgroup F. Most interestingly, the expression of the VCAM-1 gene is not up-regulated during parietal endoderm differentiation of F9 cells, suggesting that the spectrum of the target genes of Sox7 or Sox17 is different from that of Sox18 not only because of differences in spatiotemporal expression patterns but also because of functional differences, including the specificity for binding sites. The finding that the BLAST homology between murine SOX7 and murine SOX17 is higher than the homology to murine SOX18 further supports this interpretation. In the two SOX-binding sites (SOXA and SOXB) identified here, the core GACAAT motifs are preceded and followed by at least two purine residues, which is not the case for the other GACAAT motif in the Lama1 enhancer (Fig. 4A, SOX). On the other hand, the core (G/A)ACAAT motif in the SOX18-binding sites identified by Hosking et al. (45Hosking B.M. Wang S.C. Downes M. Koopman P. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5314-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) is preceded by pyrimidine residues and followed by a guanine and pyrimidines, suggesting that nucleotide residues surrounding the core motif define the binding specificities for different members of the Sox subgroup F. The observation that the overexpression of SOX7 and SOX17 potentiated the Lama1 enhancer in undifferentiated F9 cells but not in NIH/3T3 or HeLa cells suggests the involvement of additional mediator proteins or post-translational modifications of the transcription factors specific to undifferentiated F9 cells. Alternatively, an additional mechanism(s) such as remodeling in the chromatin structure or changes in methylation status of the region surrounding the Lama1 gene may also be involved in SOX7/SOX17-dependent activation of Lama1 gene expression. In support of the latter possibility, exogenous expression of SOX7 or SOX17 in undifferentiated F9 cells altered the gene expression profile only marginally2 and failed to induce the endogenous Lama1 mRNA. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that the parietal endoderm-specific enhancer of the mouse Lama1 gene is a direct target for Sox7 and Sox17. To our knowledge, this is the first report clarifying the target gene of Sox7 and Sox17. Further efforts to identify other target genes for Sox7 and Sox17 should unveil not only the functions of Sox subgroup F members but also the regulatory network of gene expressions involved in parietal endoderm differentiation and the overproduction of basement membranes.

Such events lead to morphological changes in astrocytes that resemble those occurring upon injury in the brain. Extracellular matrix proteins, typical integrin ligands, bind to integrins and promote receptor clustering as well as signal transduction events that involve small G proteins and cytoskeletal changes. Here we investigated the possibility that the cell surface protein Thy-1, when interacting with a β3-containing integrin on astrocytes, could trigger signaling events similar to those generated by extracellular matrix proteins. DI-TNC1 astrocytes were stimulated with Thy-1-Fc immobilized on beads, and increased RhoA activity was confirmed using an affinity precipitation assay. The effect of various inhibitors on the cellular response was also studied. The presence of Y-27632, an inhibitor of Rho kinase (p160ROCK), a key downstream effector of RhoA, significantly reduced focal adhesion and stress fiber formation induced by Thy-1. Similar effects were obtained when astrocytes were treated with C3 transferase, an inhibitor of RhoA. Alternatively, astrocytes were transfected with an expression vector encoding fusion proteins of enhanced green fluorescent protein with either the Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin, which blocks RhoA function, or the dominant-negative N19RhoA mutant. In both cases, Thy-1-induced focal adhesion formation was inhibited. Furthermore, we observed that RhoA activity after stimulation with soluble Thy-1-Fc molecule was augmented upon further cross-linking using protein A-Sepharose beads. The same was shown by cross-linking β3-containing integrin with anti-β3 antibodies. Together, these results indicate that Thy-1-mediated astrocyte stimulation depended on β3 integrin clustering and the resulting increase in RhoA activity.

Focal adhesions (FAs) 1The abbreviations used are: FA, focal adhesion; ECM, extracellular matrix; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; SF, stress fiber; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RBD, Rho-binding domain. mediate strong adhesion to the substrate and anchor actin stress fibers (SFs) through a supramolecular complex that consists of many different cytoskeletal as well as signaling molecules (reviewed in Refs. 1Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar and 2Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The unique features of FAs suggest that they are employed as mechanosensors to inform cells about the immediate environment. As such, FAs are implicated in transmembrane crosstalk between extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and intracellular signal transduction pathways via integrin receptors (reviewed in Refs. 3Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar and 4Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). The interaction between ECM components and integrins leads to reorganization of the cytoskeleton and regulation of cell migration. Such events have been most extensively studied in fibroblasts (reviewed in Ref. 5DeMali K.A. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2389-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and linked there to activation of small GTPases belonging to the Rho family of monomeric 20-30-kDa GTP-binding proteins. Like other members of the Ras superfamily, Rho acts as a molecular switch, cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (reviewed in Refs. 6Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar and 7Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The best-characterized members of this family are Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, all of which influence cell morphology and migration. In fibroblasts, Rho is required for the formation and maintenance of FAs and also for the formation of contractile actin-myosin filaments to form SFs (8Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and other soluble serum factors, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate, activate Rho as well as induce FA and SF formation in fibroblasts via G protein-coupled receptors (8Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). In astrocytes, the major type of glial cell in the brain, LPA also activates Rho and, consequently, the formation of FAs and SFs (9Ramakers G.J.A. Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, astrocytes have a stellate shape. When exposed to blood factors upon brain injury, they convert to a fibroblast-like morphology and undergo massive proliferation and migration to the site of injury to produce the glial scar. The latter protects the brain from secondary lesions but constitutes a major impediment to neuronal regeneration (10Ridet J.L. Malhotra S.K. Privat A. Gage F.H. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 570-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). Crushed or cut nerve fibers in the central nervous system often react with spontaneous but unsuccessful regenerative sprouting, a process that is linked to the presence of proteins that inhibit neurite outgrowth (11Huber A.B. Schwab M.E. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Shen Y.J. DeBellard M.E. Salzer J.L. Roder J. Filbin M.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 12: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Tiveron M.C. Barboni E. Pliego Rivero F.B. Gormley A.M. Seeley P.J. Grosveld F. Morris R.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that Thy-1, an abundant neuronal surface protein, binds to a β3-containing integrin receptor on astrocytes and triggers the assembly of FAs and SFs, thereby promoting cell adhesion (14Leyton L. Schneider P. Labra C.V. Rüegg C. Hetz C.A. Quest A.F.G. Bron C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, Thy-1-mediated interaction between neurons and astrocytes is expected to represent another means of neuron-glia communication. Indeed, Thy-1-dependent adhesion of neurons to astrocytes has been reported to inhibit neurite outgrowth (13Tiveron M.C. Barboni E. Pliego Rivero F.B. Gormley A.M. Seeley P.J. Grosveld F. Morris R.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Mahanthappa N.K. Patterson P.H. Dev. Biol. 1992; 150: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Dreyer E.B. Leifer D.

Our data have also implicated Thy-1 in the regulation of astrocyte morphology and adhesion through integrin β3-dependent activation of FA and SF formation. In doing so, neuronal Thy-1 appears to be involved in bidirectional signaling between astrocytes and neurons (14Leyton L. Schneider P. Labra C.V. Rüegg C. Hetz C.A. Quest A.F.G. Bron C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because most work has focused on evaluating the effects of Thy-1 in neurons (13Tiveron M.C. Barboni E. Pliego Rivero F.B. Gormley A.M. Seeley P.J. Grosveld F. Morris R.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 16Dreyer E.B. Leifer D. Heng J.E. McConnell J.E. Gorla M.

A. 1995; 92: 11195-11199Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), little is known about the events triggered by Thy-1 in astrocytes required for the formation of FAs and SFs. More recent studies from our laboratory using Y-27632, an inhibitor of the Rho effector p160ROCK, suggested that Thy-1-dependent FA and SF formation requires RhoA activation (17Avalos A.M. Labra C.V. Quest A.F. Leyton L. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 231-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the role of Rho activation in the formation of FAs and SFs in Thy-1-stimulated astrocytes was characterized. A variety of Rho inhibitors were employed, and changes in Rho activity as well as in the formation of FAs and SFs upon Thy-1 stimulation of astrocytes were studied. Our results indicate that Thy-1 binding to astrocytes stimulated RhoA activity. Furthermore, negative regulators of Rho and one of its effectors, p160ROCK, inhibited the formation of FAs and SFs triggered by Thy-1. Finally, as has been reported for ECM proteins, the efficiency of Thy-1-mediated RhoA stimulation depended on multivalent engagement of integrins. In summary, Thy-1 interaction with an astrocytic β3-containing integrin promotes FA and SF formation via RhoA activation by a process that involves integrin receptor clustering. Cells, Recombinant Proteins, and Reagents—The rat astrocytic cell line DI-TNC1, which displays many of the characteristic properties of neonatal astrocytes (18Rahemtulla N. Deschepper C.F. Maurice J. Mittal B. David S. Brain Res. 1994; 642: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), was used in these studies. These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% serum (fetal bovine serum; HyClone), 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), and 1% of the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Reagents used were His-tagged C3 transferase (Cytoskeleton), Y-27632 (Calbiochem), and LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). The recombinant proteins Thy-1-Fc and TRAIL-R2-Fc were obtained as reported previously (14Leyton L. Schneider P. Labra C.V. Rüegg C. Hetz C.A. Quest A.F.G. Bron C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and used either alone or coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). GST-Rho-binding domain (RBD) fusion proteins for the affinity precipitation assay were obtained as described previously (19Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), EGFP-RBD, and EGFP-N19RhoA DNAs were purified using a Qiagen plasmid purification kit. Immunofluorescence reagents were rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) and the antibodies mouse anti-paxillin monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-N-cadherin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate and goat anti-mouse Cy3 polyclonal antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Other antibodies used were anti-β3 integrin mAb (clone F11; Pharmingen), mouse anti-RhoA mAb (Cytoskeleton and Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (Bio-Rad). Peroxidase reactivity was visualized using Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). All other reagents used for immunofluorescence, affinity precipitation assays, and Western blots were from Sigma. RhoA Activity Assay (Affinity Precipitation)—Astrocytes were grown in 6-cm plates, and RhoA activity was measured using the affinity precipitation assay as described previously (20Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved for 16 h and subsequently stimulated with Thy-1-Fc- or TRAIL-R2-Fc-protein A-Sepharose beads for 5 and 15 min. TRAIL-R2-Fc, a fusion protein prepared and obtained in the same way as Thy-1-Fc, was used as a negative control in these experiments (14Leyton L. Schneider P. Labra C.V. Rüegg C. Hetz C.A. Quest A.F.G. Bron C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Starved cells and treatment with anti-N-cadherin-protein A-Sepharose beads were also used as negative controls, whereas LPA- or serum-stimulated cells (2 min) represented positive controls. In other experiments, cells were stimulated with soluble Thy-1-Fc protein only or anti-β3 integrin antibody (15 min) and further cross-linked by addition of protein A-Sepharose beads (15 min) or treated with Thy-1-Fc-protein A-Sepharose beads (15 min). After stimulation, cells were washed twice with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 N NaCl and lysed with buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6) containing 0.15 N NaCl; 0.1% SDS; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 1% Triton X-100; 0.5 mm MgCl2; 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and benzamidine; and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Lysates were cleared at 13,000 × g for 4 min, and the supernatant was used for the Rho activity assay as described previously (20Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Proteins on the beads were recovered by boiling the samples in Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 15% gel. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with anti-RhoA mAbs. BCA reagent (Pierce) was used to determine the protein concentration of the whole cell lysates that were also used in immunoblots for RhoA as input controls. Densitometric analysis was performed using the UN-SCAN-IT gel automated digitalizing system (Silk Scientific Corp.). Indirect Immunofluorescence—The day before treatment with the different RhoA modulators, astrocytes were grown on sterile coverslips in 24-well plates in complete RPMI 1640 medium. Astrocytes were loaded with C3 transferase for 1 h at 37 °C, as described previously (21Renshaw M.W. Toksoz D. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21691-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of C3 transferase, mixed with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE and 20 μl of serum-free medium, were incubated for 15 min before addition to the astrocytes in 400 μl of serum-free medium. Astrocytes were also treated with Y-27632 at different concentrations in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C, as described previously (22Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar), or transiently transfected with either EGFP-, EGFP-RBD-, or EGFP-N19RhoA-containing plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. After the treatments or transfections described previously, astrocytes were either stimulated with Thy-1-Fc-protein A-Sepharose beads for 10 min or left unstimulated. Then, the beads were removed by three gentle washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm PIPES buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.04 m KOH, 2 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2. Afterwards, they were washed three times with 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and twice with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and aprotinin, leupeptin, and benzamidine (10 μg/ml each) for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 15 min. Cells were then stained with an anti-paxillin mAb, followed by a second antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate and phalloidin conjugated to rhodamine or a second antibody coupled to Cy3 when cells were transfected with green fluorescent protein constructs. After washing and mounting the coverslips on microscope slides with Mowiol-2.5% 1,4-Diazabicyclo [2.2.2]octane, fluorophores were visualized by confocal microscopy in a Zeiss LSM-410 Axiovert-100 confocal microscope (Unidad de Analisis Celular Integral, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Chile). The number of FA sites per cell was quantified using the ImageJ software program from the National Institutes of Health public domain. The number of focal adhesions was estimated by selecting structures of determined pixel range above a threshold value. Tyrosine phosphorylation at focal contacts formed by astrocytes cultured on plates is enhanced by incubation with either Thy-1-Fc coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads or cells containing high levels of Thy-1 on their surface. Thy-1-dependent cell-cell interaction is blocked by RLD-containing peptides and by anti-β3 integrin antibodies (14Leyton L. Schneider P. Labra C.V. Rüegg C. Hetz C.A. Quest A.F.G. Bron C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Hence, FA formation observed in astrocytes in culture is enhanced by cell-cell interactions requiring a β3 integrin, and this can be mimicked by adding Thy-1-coated beads to the cells (14Leyton L. Schneider P. Labra C.V. Rüegg C. Hetz C.A. Quest A.F.G. Bron C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because integrins are generally considered receptors for ECM, rather than cell surface proteins, molecular mechanisms employed in integrin-mediated FA and SF formation were investigated in Thy-1-stimulated astrocytes. We first tested whether Thy-1-induced FA and SF formation required activation of RhoA. To measure the activity of RhoA in astrocytes under various conditions, we used an affinity precipitation assay described previously (23Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). DI-TNC1 astrocytes were stimulated with either LPA (a known activator of RhoA), Thy-1-Fc-protein A-Sepharose beads (Thy-1-Fc beads), or TRAIL-R2-Fc-protein A-Sepharose beads (TRAIL-R2-Fc beads) as a control. Subsequently, active Rho-GTP from cell lysates was precipitated by incubation with the GST-RBD fusion protein coupled to glutathione-agarose beads (20Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 23Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Similar levels of total Rho protein were observed in all whole cell lysates (Fig. 1, Total RhoA), whereas incubation with Thy-1-Fc beads, but not TRAIL-R2-Fc beads, stimulated RhoA activity (Active RhoA). Activation was time-dependent because incubation with Thy-1-Fc beads yielded higher levels of active RhoA at 15 min than after 5 min. To corroborate these results, astrocytes were treated with different modulators of Rho activity. As reported previously, Thy-1-Fc coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads stimulated the formation of FAs and SFs (Fig. 2A, gray bars; Fig. 2C, top panels) (14Leyton L. Schneider P. Labra C.V. Rüegg C. Hetz C.A. Quest A.F.G. Bron C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Controls in these experiments included treatments with either anti-N-cadherin antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (anti-N-cadherin beads) or TRAIL-R2-Fc beads. Anti-N-cadherin antibodies bound to the surface of astrocytes, as revealed by immunofluorescence experiments (data not shown), but did not affect FA and SF formation (Fig. 2A; Fig.2C, top panels). TRAIL-R-2-Fc beads do not bind to astrocytes; however, because this fusion protein was prepared in the same manner as Thy-1-Fc, it served as an appropriate control for the Fc-fusion protein and beads used. As expected, based on our previous results, no changes in astrocyte morphology or FA and SF formation were observed in response to treatment with TRAIL-R2-Fc beads (Fig. 2A; Fig.2C, top panels). Upon binding to GTP, Rho interacts with and activates different downstream effectors (reviewed in Refs. 24Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 25Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Among these effectors, p160ROCK (also known as Rho kinase) is involved in Rho-induced formation of FAs and actin SFs (26Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of p160ROCK in Thy-1-stimulated formation of FAs and SFs in astrocytes, the specific inhibitor Y-27632 was employed (22Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar, 27Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 273-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous results with this compound indicate that 50 μm Y-27632 decreases the formation of FAs and SFs induced by Thy-1 (17Avalos A.M. Labra C.V. Quest A.F. Leyton L. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 231-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because Y-27632 is reported to be specific for p160ROCK at 10 μm (22Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of lower concentrations of this inhibitor was tested. In cells treated with Y-27632, morphological changes were apparent at 5 μm when compared with nontreated cells (Fig. 2B). Because basal FAs were reduced over 50% with 10 μm Y-27632, and this value was not significantly different from the results obtained with 50 μm Y-27632, the former concentration was used to assess the effect of this p160ROCK inhibitor on Thy-1-stimulated FAs and SFs. In general, only a few FAs and SFs, as well as small focal complexes, were visible at 10 μm Y-27632. The remaining actin bundles and adhesion contacts were mainly associated with the lateral cell border (Fig. 2C, bottom panels). Morphological changes produced by Y-27632 were not reversed by treatment with Thy-1-Fc beads (Fig. 2A, black bars), indicating that FA and SF formation induced by Thy-1 depended on at least one Rho effector, p160ROCK. To test a different Rho activity modulator, astrocytes were loaded with the exoenzyme C3 transferase that specifically inactivates Rho-dependent signaling pathways by selective Rho-ADP-ribosylation. C3 transferase was introduced into cells using liposomes containing polycationic and neutral lipids, as has been reported for NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (21Renshaw M.W. Toksoz D. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21691-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and HeLa cells (28Maddox A.S. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures). Treatment with C3 transferase led to the disassembly of basal levels of FAs and SFs in both nonstimulated (Fig. 3, top right panels) and TRAIL-R2-Fc bead-treated cells (data not shown). This effect was not reversed upon Thy-1 stimulation (Fig. 3, bottom right panels). Therefore, RhoA inhibition by C3 transferase prevented Thy-1-induced FA and SF formation in astrocytes. As an alternative strategy to block RhoA activity, astrocytes were transiently transfected with a vector expressing the RBD of Rhotekin as an EGFP fusion protein. This RBD binds to active RhoA, thereby sequestering RhoA and preventing its interaction with endogenous effectors. In astrocytes expressing EGFP-RBD, a diminished number of FAs were apparent, and these structures failed to develop in response to Thy-1 (Fig. 4, right panels). No effect was detected when expressing EGFP alone (Fig. 4, left panels). Thus, these results corroborate the notion that FA formation induced by Thy-1 in astrocytes is RhoA-dependent. To further demonstrate that Thy-1-stimulated formation of FAs depends on active RhoA, astrocytes were transiently transfected with a vector expressing an EGFP-tagged dominant-negative mutant of Rho (N19RhoA). This mutant binds to guanine nucleotide exchange factors, thereby preventing the activation of endogenous Rho (29Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). EGFP alone did not affect the formation of FAs in nonstimulated cells (Fig. 4, NS) or Thy-1-Fc-stimulated cells (Fig. 5, top panels; Fig. 4, left panels). In astrocytes expressing EGFP-N19RhoA, decreased basal levels of FAs were detected (data not shown). This phenotype was not altered upon Thy-1 stimulation (see the outlined area in the bottom panels), whereas untransfected adjacent cells still responded to Thy-1-Fc beads (Fig. 5, bottom panels). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Rho activation is required for Thy-1-induced FA formation in astrocytes. Signal transduction pathways triggered by integrin ligation are known to involve clustering of the receptors, which permits their association with cytoplasmic proteins that connect them to the cytoskeleton (reviewed in Ref. 30Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). Because cell surface Thy-1 induces its effects in astrocytes engaging a β3 integrin (14Leyton L. Schneider P. Labra C.V. Rüegg C. Hetz C.A. Quest A.F.G. Bron C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the hypothesis that Thy-1 acted as a multivalent ligand was tested. Astrocytes were stimulated with serum or soluble Thy-1-Fc (sThy-1), and the latter was subsequently cross-linked by the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads. In astrocytes treated only with sThy-1, a small but significant stimulation of RhoA activity was observed (Fig. 6A). However, upon addition of either Thy-1-Fc previously bound to the beads (Thy-1-beads) or protein A-Sepharose beads in the presence of Thy-1-Fc molecules already bound to the cells (sThy-1 + beads), RhoA activity was significantly enhanced by 5- and 7-fold, respectively, as determined by densitometric analysis (Fig. 6A). As a negative control, anti-N-cadherin antibodies were also used. N-cadherin belongs to a family of Ca2+-dependent adhesion molecules and does not activate RhoA (31Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 32Noren N.K. Arthur W.T. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13615-13618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were cross-linked with protein A-Sepharose beads, and, as expected, RhoA activity did not increase (1.01 ± 0.094, average ± S.E.; n = 5). According to our previous results, Thy-1 elicits responses in astrocytes by engaging a β3-containing integrin (14Leyton L. Schneider P. Labra C.V. Rüegg C. Hetz C.A. Quest A.F.G. Bron C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate that in astrocytes Thy-1 activates RhoA by clustering integrin β3 receptors, astrocytes were treated with anti-β3 antibodies and subsequently cross-linked by the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads. Little effect was obtained when anti-β3 antibodies (Fig. 6B, α-β3) were used alone. However, if antibodies were cross-linked with protein A-Sepharose beads (α-β3 + beads), activation of Rho protein was apparent (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these results indicate that engagement of a β3 integrin on astrocytes by Thy-1 triggers Rho activation in a manner that depends on the extent of integrin cross-linking. Thy-1, a highly abundant protein present on the surface of mammalian neurons, was identified as a ligand for a β3-containing integrin, probably αVβ3 (14Leyton L. Schneider P. Labra C.V. Rüegg C. Hetz C.A. Quest A.F.G. Bron C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Binding of Thy-1 to this integrin present in astrocyte membranes stimulates the assembly of FAs and SFs in astrocytes. High levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of FA proteins and recruitment of proteins that form this large supramolecular complex have also been reported upon Thy-1-stimulation of astrocytes (14Leyton L. Schneider P. Labra C.V. Rüegg C. Hetz C.A. Quest A.F.G. Bron C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Typical ligands of integrins are proteins of the ECM. Cell-matrix contacts are specialized sites of the cell surface where integrins link the ECM to the cytoskeleton. Plating cells on fibronectin or other ECM proteins that engage integrins activates a variety of signaling pathways that result in cell spreading, membrane ruffling, and eventually FA and SF formation. These events require coordinated activation of the small G proteins Rac and Cdc42 (33Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), as well as Rho (34Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Because molecular mechanisms governing signaling by cell-cell interaction need not be the same as those involved in cell-ECM interaction, we investigated signaling pathways triggered by Thy-1-dependent engagement of integrins on the surface of astrocytes. The results obtained indicated that Thy-1 promoted activation of the small G protein RhoA (Fig. 1) most efficiently when presented as a multivalent ligand (Fig. 6). The role of RhoA and one of its effectors (p160ROCK) was further substantiated by treating the cells with either C3 transferase or the p160ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632), respectively (Figs. 2 and 3). Inhibition of p160ROCK with Y-27632 also appeared to induce membrane ruffles and focal complexes (Fig. 2C, bottom panels), which were not seen upon C3 treatment (Fig. 3). A similar phenomenon has been reported in fibroblasts to be associated with a different pathway emanating from active Rho that includes activation of mDia, phosphorylation of p130Cas, and Rac activation (35Tsuji T. Ishizaki T. Okamoto M. Higashida C. Kimura K. Furuyashiki T. Arakawa Y. Birge R.B. Nakamoto T. Hirai H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Whether this pathway also operates in astrocytes remains to be tested. On the other hand, sequestration of active Rho by expression of an RBD-containing protein (Fig. 4) or inhibition of RhoA activation by expression of a dominant-negative RhoA protein (Fig. 5) led to disassembly of existing FAs and prevented Thy-1-stimulated FA formation. These results underscore the importance of RhoA activity in both maintenance of FAs in non-stimulated astrocytes and Thy-1-induced FA formation. Furthermore, the morphology of cells expressing these fusion proteins was more strongly altered than in Y-27632-treated cells, where residual actin filaments and adhesion points associated with the cell border were still apparent (Fig. 2C). The latter observation suggests that the pathway controlled by p160ROCK might not be the only one downstream of Rho important for cytoskeletal organization in astrocytes. Differential regulation of Rho activity by various integrins has been reported previously (36O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Moreover, an initial dip in Rho activity has been observed when fibroblasts are plated on fibronectin (23Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) or upon treating them in suspension with soluble RGD peptides (34Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) known to engage α5β1 integrin. Reports also indicate that β3 and β1 integrins could lead to different responses, but the effect seems to depend on the cell type (37Danen E.H. Sonneveld P. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1071-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 38Miao H. Li S. Hu Y.L. Yuan S. Zhao Y. Chen B.P. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Tarui T. Shyy J.Y. Takada Y. Usami S. Chien S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in all cases, activation of the receptors was achieved using ECM-derived ligands. In experiments shown here, integrin engagement upon cell-cell interaction was mimicked using adherent astrocytes and subsequently adding surface-bound Thy-1 ligand. With this approach, Rho activity was stimulated by treatment with soluble Thy-1 and substantially enhanced when the degree of cross-linking was increased (Fig. 6). Addition of soluble Thy-1-Fc fusion protein increased the RhoA activity of treated astrocytes 2-3-fold, indicating that ligand binding and a modest degree of cross-linking (Thy-1-Fc is a dimeric molecule) were sufficient to trigger RhoA activation in adherent cells (Fig. 6). Independent of the manner in which cells were treated, Thy-1 significantly increased RhoA activity when compared with starved cells. Moreover, RhoA activation caused by soluble Thy-1 was significantly enhanced upon subsequent addition of protein A-Sepharose beads, indicating that the extent of RhoA activation depended on the degree of receptor cross-linking. Similar results were obtained when cross-linking anti-β3 antibodies on astrocytes, whereas no activation was seen when anti-N-cadherin antibodies were cross-linked. Thus, for already adherent astrocytes, the receptor engaged by both soluble Thy-1 and anti-β3 antibodies activated RhoA when cross-linked on the surface of astrocytes. Should these and other results now be taken to indicate that cell-ECM interactions involve initial inhibition of RhoA, whereas cell-cell interactions immediately activate RhoA and thereby promote FA formation? The most likely answer is no. The initial inhibition of RhoA seen upon cell-ECM interaction might be due to the fact that rounding of cells upon trypsinization increases Rho activity, possibly to facilitate cell retraction due to changes in cortical actin cytoskeleton (28Maddox A.S. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Such elevated activity levels need to be reduced to allow cells to adhere to and spread over a substrate. Thus, differential modulation of Rho activity could be due to the cell type used (see above and also see Ref. 39DeMali K.A. Wennerberg K. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), the integrin engaged, the nature of the ligand, and/or the mode of stimulation. In our experiments, astrocytes were already bound to the plate. Small FAs were apparent, and Rho activity was kept low by starving cells before stimulation. Under these conditions, processes such as membrane ruffling and cell spreading are not required. Instead, Thy-1 stimulation increased both the size and number of pre-existing adhesions, which correlates well with the observed activation of RhoA. FAs and SFs are prominent in many cells grown in culture, including astrocytes, but are rarely seen in cells within the body. They reflect elevation of Rho activity and the resulting tension exerted on a rigid, two-dimensional substratum (1Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). We have shown here that the induction of FAs and SFs in cultured astrocytes by binding of Thy-1 requires increased Rho activity. In cell culture, increased formation of such structures is associated with elevated contractility. In the brain, increases in astrocytic contractility may represent another form of neuron-astrocyte communication and perhaps contribute to wound healing and scar formation. Because the glial scar constitutes a serious impediment to neuronal regeneration, elevated tension exerted by astrocytes on neighboring neurons may represent one of several mechanisms by which the scar prevents neuronal repair upon brain injury. In summary, our results indicate that when the cell surface protein Thy-1 engages the astrocytic αVβ3 integrin, signaling cascades that include RhoA and p160ROCK activation are required to induce FA and SF formation in astrocytes. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the degree of Rho activation depended on clustering of integrin β3 receptors. Additional studies will investigate whether Thy-1-triggered FA and SF formation in astrocytes via Rho-dependent signal transduction pathways is relevant for processes involving neuron-glia communication in the brain."

ATP synthases/ATPases are present in every life form and are the most important enzymes for the energy metabolism of the cell (1Yoshida M. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). They catalyze the formation of ATP at the expense of the transmembrane electrochemical ion gradient. They arose from a common ancestor that underwent structural and functional changes leading to three distinct classes of A1A0 1The abbreviations used are: A1A0 ATPase, Archaea-type ATPase; F1F0, F1F0 ATP synthase; V1V0 ATPase, vacuolar-type ATPase., F1F0, and V1V0 ATP synthases/ATPases. The V-type ATPases, found in organelles of eukaryotes, lost their ability to synthesize ATP. Their function is to create steep ion gradients at the expense of ATP hydrolysis (2Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Archaea contain ATPases, the A1A0 ATP synthases, that are structurally similar to V1V0 ATPases but synthesize ATP like the F-type ATPases. The genomic sequences available today show that the overall subunit composition of the A1A0 ATP synthases is very similar to the V1V0 ATPases. For example, the A1A0 ATP synthases contain duplicated and even triplicated K subunits (proteolipids) (3Müller V. Ruppert C. Lemker T. J. Bioenerg. Biomebr. 1999; 31: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4Müller V. Grüber G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 474-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The A1A0 ATP synthase has at least nine subunits (A3B3CDEFHIKX), but the actual subunit stoichiometry, especially regarding the proteolipid subunits K in A ATPases, is different in various organisms (12, 6, 4, or as suggested by genomic data, only 1 (5Müller V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). The A1A0 ATP synthase is composed of a water-soluble A1 ATPase and an integral membrane subcomplex, A0. ATP is synthesized or hydrolyzed on the A1 headpiece consisting of an A3B3 domain, and the energy that is provided for or released during that process is transmitted to the membrane-bound A0 domain (4Müller V. Grüber G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 474-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The energy coupling between the two active domains occurs via the so-called stalk part, an assembly proposed to be composed of the subunits C, D, and F (6Coskun Ü. Grüber G. Koch M.H.J.

At the upper end of the hexagonal barrel, extensions can be observed that are assumed to belong to the N termini of subunit A (7Coskun Ü. Radermacher M. Müller V. Ruiz T. Grüber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22759-22764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Further insights into the topology of the A1 ATPase were obtained by differential protease sensitivity (8Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and cross-linking studies (6Coskun Ü. Grüber G. Koch M.H.J. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Lemker T. Müller V. J. Biol.

These studies resulted in a model in which the subunits C, D (partly), and F form the central stalk domain (7Coskun Ü. Radermacher M. Müller V. Ruiz T. Grüber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22759-22764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the related F- and V-type ATP synthases/ATPases, little is known regarding the overall structure of the A1A0 molecule, which is largely due to the instability of the isolated complexes (10Wilms R. Freiberg C. Wegerle E. Meier I. Mayer F. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18843-18852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Most recently, an isolation procedure of the A1A0 ATP synthase of the hyperthermophilic Archaea Methanococcus jannaschii resulted in a complete and functionally coupled enzyme (11Lingl A. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Mayer F. Kellermann J. Müller V. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Besides the property of being an enzyme of a hyperthermophilic organism whose multienzyme complexes are believed to be more stable than those of mesophiles, the M. jannaschii A1A0 ATP synthase is of particular interest because it has a K subunit three times the size of that of most bacteria and Archaea. Furthermore, this subunit has lost one of the ion translocating residues (12Ruppert C. Kavermann H. Wimmers S. Schmid R. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25281-25284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, we used electron microscopy to visualize directly the structure of the A1A0 ATP synthase from M. jannaschii. A comparison with the low resolution structure of the A1 ATPase from M. mazei Gö1, derived from small-angle x-ray scattering data and single particle electron microscopy, allowed the unambiguous identification of most of the densities in the stalk domain and the A0 part. The structure of the complete A1A0 ATP synthase also facilitates, for the first time, a comparison with structural models of the related F1F0 ATP synthase and V1V0 ATPase holoenzymes. Materials—All of the chemicals were of reagent grade and were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), BIOMOL (Hamburg, Germany), Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), or Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Protein Preparation—The A1A0 ATP synthase of M. jannaschii was purified by sucrose density centrifugation and anion-exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose) as described previously (11Lingl A. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Mayer F. Kellermann J. Müller V. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ATPase-active fractions were pooled and concentrated on Centricon 100-kDa concentrators (Millipore). The concentrated sample was loaded on a Superose 6 column (10/30, Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl, 10% glycerine, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Pefabloc SC (a final concentration of 1 mm, BIOMOL). The peak fractions, which were stained with silver, were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (13Schägger H. Cramer W.A. v. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 14Damerval C. le Guillioux M. Blaisomeau J. de Vienne D. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 158-159Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity was determined as described earlier (15Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy and Image Analysis—Protein was prepared on freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Images of the negatively stained A1A0 ATP synthase were collected on a Philips CM20FEG electron microscope operating at 200 kV and liquid N2-cooled specimen to reduce radiation damage. Images of 2,048 × 2,048 pixels (after a binning of 2) were recorded at ×67,200 magnification at a pixel size of 30 μm with a Gatan 4000 SP 4K slow-scan CCD camera with GRACE software for semi-automated specimen selection and data acquisition (16Oostergetel G.T. Keegstra W. Brisson A. Ultramicroscopy. 1998; 74: 47-59Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Single particle analysis was performed with the GRIP (Groningen image processing) software package on a PC cluster. 2W. Keegstra, unpublished data. A total of 17,238 single particle projections (128 × 128 pixel frame; pixel size of 0.34 nm) from 331 images were obtained by selecting all of the discernable particles. For each micrograph, the defocus value was determined and a simple contrast transfer function correction by phase reversal was done (17Frank J. Penczek P. Optik. 1995; 98: 125-129Google Scholar). After band-pass filtering, the images were subsequently subjected to multireference alignment, multivariate statistical analysis, and hierarchical ascendant classification. This dataset was divided into two subsets including either one or two peripheral stalks to obtain a more homogenous dataset for a refinement of these classes. The subsets were analyzed in parallel by reference-free alignment (18Dube P. Bacher G. Stark H. Mueller F. Zemlin F. van Heel M. Brimacombe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 403-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Each rotational and translational alignment was repeated four times, and classification was done by multivariate statistical analysis. Datasets were again divided and aligned as described above. The final classification of the homogenous datasets was performed by multivariate statistical analysis and hierarchical classification to extract the key structural features of the enzyme (19van Heel M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 6: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar). The resolution of the class averages was measured according to van Heel (20van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1984; 13: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Subunit Composition and Electron Microscopy—A characteristic gel of the preparation of the A1A0 ATP synthase from M. jannaschii is presented in Fig. 1A showing the nine subunits, A–F, H, I, and K, with apparent molecular masses of 66, 51, 45, 25, 23, 11, 10, 77, and 21 kDa, respectively. A typical electron microscopy raw image of the enzyme yields monodisperse particles with almost no contamination by smaller particles that could represent dissociated complexes or fragments (Fig. 1B). A total of 17,238 such molecular images were subjected to image processing. Fig. 2 demonstrates different class sums of the A1A0 ATP synthase projections obtained after several steps of reference-free translational/rotational alignment, multivariate statistical analysis, and multireference alignment. All of the projections reveal a tripartite structure consisting of a headpiece, a membrane-embedded domain, and a connecting stalk region. The classes can be grouped in respect to the number of visible stalks: one group showing one peripheral stalk besides the central stalk (Fig. 2, frames A1–4; 12,555 particles) and a second group with two peripheral stalks on both the left and right side (Fig. 2, frames B1–4; 4,683 particles). To obtain more homogeneous classes, both data sets, including either two or three stalks, were analyzed separately as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3 shows averages of each refined data set at a resolution of 1.8 nm (Fig. 3, A–C). In all of the averages, the A1A0 ATP synthase from M. jannaschii has a total length of 25.9 nm. The dimensions of the A1 headpiece, the central stalk domain, and the membrane portion, A0, are 9.4 × 11.5, 8.0 × 3.9, and 6.4 × 10.6 nm, respectively. The A1 headpiece has a rather spherical mass that is clearly separated from the stalk domain at its base (Fig. 3B). The stalk domain is formed by a central stalk and either one (Fig. 3A) or two peripheral stalks (Fig. 3B). This observation might be explained either by some of the complexes being disrupted or by these classes containing complexes in different orientation. The central stalk can be divided into an asymmetric upper part and a collar-like structure located above the A0 domain. In the collar, several distinct densities could be resolved. At both ends of this domain, two of such densities are connected to the peripheral stalks (Fig. 3B), which go all the way up to the A1 headpiece. One of these stalks appears to be in close contact with two areas of the A1 headpiece with one located at the outside and the second located on top of the A3B3 headpiece (Fig. 3, B and C). This peripheral stalk shows a clear connection to the A0 portion via the collar structure (Fig. 3, B and C). By comparison, the second peripheral stalk is attached to the top of the A1 headpiece (Fig. 3C) and extended slightly down from the collar domain (Fig. 3B). A corresponding weak density rises up from the A0 (Fig. 3B). Whereas the peripheral stalk(s) seems to be connected to the outside of the A0 domain, the central stalk is attached to the center of the membrane-embedded A0, which appears as a rather symmetric flattened sphere and slightly tilted in most of the projections, especially in Fig. 2, frame B3.Fig. 2A gallery of selected classes resulting from the last multivariate statistical analysis and classification of 17,238 particles of the A1A0 ATP synthase. Four classes (1–4) showing either one (A) or two (B) peripheral stalk(s) besides the central stalk are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Total averages calculated from 410 (A), 497 (B), and 316 (C) images.

Chem. 2004; 279: 22759-22764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) determined from tilt pairs of negatively stained molecules was superimposed on the projection of the A1A0 ATP synthase from M. jannaschii (Fig. 4, panel C) by rotating the A1 subcomplex in 5° steps through 360°. One of the projections of the A1 from M. mazei Gö1 is well accommodated within the A1 headpiece, composed of the A3B3D subassembly (7Coskun Ü. Radermacher M. Müller V. Ruiz T. Grüber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22759-22764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the upper central stalk, which is only partially (35%) solved in the three-dimensional reconstruction of the A1 ATPase from M. mazei Gö1 (7Coskun Ü. Radermacher M. Müller V. Ruiz T. Grüber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22759-22764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this projection, one of the catalytic A subunits is on the right of the A1 domain, implying that the peripheral stalk on the right may be close to this major A subunit. Nevertheless, from the superposition of the A1 profile with the A1 part in the A1A0 ATP synthase images, it is clear that the cap at the top of the A1 headpiece (Figs. 3B and 4C) does not belong to the A3B3D subassembly. To further examine the composition of the central stalk, the projection of the A1A0 ATP synthase from M. jannaschii was compared with the solution structure of the A3B3CDF complex of the A1 ATPase from M. mazei Gö1 deduced from solution x-ray scattering data (8Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The central stalk of the hydrated A3B3CDF complex, which consists of the subunits C, F, and a part of subunit D, is 8.4 nm in length (8Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and fits well to the dimensions (8 nm) of the elongated central stalk of the negative-stained A1A0 ATP synthase, indicating that the central stalk is made up by the subunits C, D (partly), and F. The A1A0 ATP synthase has been described as a chimeric enzyme combining the structural and functional features of F1F0 ATP synthases and V1V0 ATPases (4Müller V. Grüber G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 474-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Single particle analysis resulted in the visualization of projections of the A1A0 ATP synthase from M. jannaschii consisting of an A1 headpiece and an A0 domain linked by a central stalk and two peripheral stalks. The A1 headpiece fits well with the projection of the recently determined three-dimensional reconstruction with the A1 complex from M. mazei Gö1 composed of the hexagonal A3B3 domain surrounding a cavity in which the central stalk subunit D is located (7Coskun Ü.

A key feature from the superposition of the A1 complex from M. mazei Gö1 and the A1A0 ATP synthase is the close fit at the top of the A1 headpiece showing the knoblike structures. These knobs, also found in the related V-type ATPase (22Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Photosyn.

J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 2597-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They point out that the cap at the very top of the A1A0 molecule (Fig. 4C) is not formed by a subunit belonging to the soluble A1 domain (see below). The comparison of the A1A0 ATP synthase with the recently determined envelope of the M. mazei Gö1A3B3CDF complex in solution (8Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) yields that there is no significant shrinkage of the A1A0 molecule through the negative staining procedure. The central stalk is rather elongated (∼8 nm) and in close contact with A0. As described recently, the central stalk of the M. mazei Gö1 A3B3CDF complex accommodates subunits C, F, and partly D (7Coskun Ü. Radermacher M. Müller V. Ruiz T. Grüber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22759-22764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cross-linking data of this complex indicate that subunit F is in close neighborhood to one of the nucleotide-binding B subunits (Fig. 5) and that F, together with the central stalk subunits C and D, undergoes significant structural rearrangements depending on nucleotide binding (6Coskun Ü.

Such nucleotide-dependent alterations of stalk subunits C, D, and F will facilitate the mechanistic linkage of ATP synthesis/hydrolysis in the A3B3 hexamer to ion pumping in the A0 part via the central CDF stalk domain. The length and the shape of the central stalk of the A1 part resemble those of the related V1 ATPase (8Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Svergun D.I. Konrad S. Huss M. Koch M.H.J. Wieczorek H. Altendorf K. Volkov V.V. Grüber G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17659-17663Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, the central stalk of the complete bacterial F1 ATPase is substantially shorter (4.0–4.5 nm) (9Svergun D.I. Konrad S. Huss M. Koch M.H.J. Wieczorek H. Altendorf K. Volkov V.V. Grüber G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17659-17663Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Grüber G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The question that now arises is, which subunits of the A1A0 ATP synthase contribute to the A0 domain, the peripheral stalks, and the additional mass on top of A1. The A1A0 ATP synthase as isolated has nine subunits (A–I, K). Five of them form the A1 part and are assembled in the stoichiometry A3B3CDF (see above). The I and K subunits form the membrane domain, A0 (11Lingl A. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Mayer F. Kellermann J. Müller V. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Ruppert C. Kavermann H. Wimmers S. Schmid R. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25281-25284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Subunit I (70 kDa) is very similar to subunit a of V1V0 ATPases with a hydrophilic N-terminal and a hydrophobic C-terminal domain. The C terminus of subunit I is predicted to have seven transmembrane helices and is assumed to be functionally similar to subunit a of the V1V0 ATPases and F1F0 ATP synthases (3Müller V. Ruppert C. Lemker T. J. Bioenerg. Biomebr. 1999; 31: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is predicted to be highly α-helical and assumed to be the functional homolog of the soluble domain of peripheral stalk subunit b of F1F0 ATP synthases. Because only one of the peripheral stalks is clearly attached to the outside of the A0 domain, we conclude that the hydrophilic N terminus of subunit I emerges from the membrane-embedded A0 part and may go up along the side of A1 until the top of the A1 headpiece (Fig. 5). Whether the N-terminal domain might partly contribute to the cap on the top of the A1A0 molecule can only be speculated. In the presented average, the peripheral stalk (right) has a kinked structure in the lower part, giving this domain the flexibility to wrap around the A1 headpiece and ending up as the cap on the top (Fig. 3, B and C). Insertion and deletion of altered length in the so-called “tether” domain of the peripheral stalk subunit b of the Escherichia coli F1F0 ATP synthase, which is located above the membrane service, can be tolerated by the enzyme, indicating that this related connecting stalk has an inherent flexible structure (31Grabar T.B. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 37: 34751-34756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It has been suggested for the F1F0 ATP synthases that flexibility of the domain might allow reorientation of the stalk to act as a stator for rotation in one direction during ATP synthesis and in the opposite direction during ATP hydrolysis (31Grabar T.B. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 37: 34751-34756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Hardy A.W. Grabar T.B. Bhatt D. Cain B.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Subunit K is a homolog of the F-type subunit c with two transmembrane helices. It consists of fused tandem repeats of sequences corresponding to the F-type subunit. M. jannaschii has a subunit K with six membrane-spanning helices (27 kDa) but with only two active carboxylates per monomer (12Ruppert C. Kavermann H. Wimmers S. Schmid R. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F.

As in the case of the F-type ATP synthases (33Stock D. Gibbons C. Arechaga I. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 34Vonck J. von Nidda T.K. Meier T. Matthey U. Mills D.J. Kühlbrandt W. Dimroth P. J. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44064-44068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the K subunits (or c in the F- and V-type ATPases) are thought to form a ring, which belongs to the rotary element inside the A1A0 ATP synthase. As shown in Fig. 4, the bottom of the central CDF-stalk domain spans the upper center of the A0 domain, facilitating the direct contact of the rotary elements, which consists of an ensemble made from the central stalk (CDF domain) and a ring of hydrophobic K subunits in the A0 membrane domain (21Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2312-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The second peripheral stalk appears to be connected to the collar domain and goes up to the A1 headpiece. Probable candidates for this stalk are the remaining A1A0-hydrophilic subunits H (12 kDa) and E (25 kDa) with the latter predicted to be highly α-helical (12Ruppert C. Kavermann H. Wimmers S. Schmid R. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25281-25284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The modest contact area of this peripheral stalk with the A1 headpiece, which is also evident in electron micrographs of the related bacterial V1V0 ATPase from Caloramator fervidus (36Boekema E.J. van Bremen J.F.L. Brisson A. Ubbink-Kok T. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 37-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), might be caused partially by stain accumulation. The top view projection of the rotated A1 complex (Fig. 4, panel D) shows a groove at the top of the A3B3-hexamer in close neighborhood to this peripheral stalk. Such a groove-like feature may form a binding domain for the peripheral connection in the A1 headpiece. In general, the positions of the peripheral stalks of the A1A0 ATP synthase as deduced from side views cannot be directly verified from top view projections, because such projection are not present in significant numbers if intact A1A0 molecules are prepared. In summary, the first two dimensional projection maps of the A1A0 ATP synthase from M. jannaschii presented provides the structural basis toward a fuller understanding of the mechanistic events occurring in this class of enzymes. The reconstruction at a 1.8-nm resolution shows similarities and diversities between the structural modules to the evolutionary-linked F1F0 ATP synthases and V1V0 ATPases, such as the catalytic A1/F1/V1 headpiece and the central stalk domain. Although the existence of one (26Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37Rubinstein J.L. Walker J.E. Henderson R.

These type I transmembrane proteins undergo two distinct presenilin-dependent cleavages within the transmembrane region, which result in the production of Aβ and APP intracellular domain (from βAPP) and the Notch intracellular domain signaling peptide. Most cases of familial Alzheimer's disease are caused by presenilin mutations, which are scattered throughout the coding sequence. Although the underlying molecular mechanism is not yet known, the familial Alzheimer's disease mutations produce a shift in the ratio of the long and short forms of the Aβ peptide generated by the γ-secretase. We and others have previously shown that presenilin homodimerizes and suggested that a presenilin dimer is at the catalytic core of γ-secretase. Here, we demonstrate that presenilin transmembrane domains contribute to the formation of the dimer. In-frame substitution of the hydrophilic loop 1, located between transmembranes I and II, which modulates the interactions within the N-terminal fragment/N-terminal fragment dimer, abolishes both presenilinase and γ-secretase activities. In addition, by reconstituting γ-secretase activity from two catalytically inactive presenilin aspartic mutants, we provide evidence of an active diaspartyl group assembled at the interface between two presenilin monomers. Under our conditions, this catalytic group mediates the generation of APP intracellular domain and Aβ but not Notch intracellular domain, therefore suggesting that specific diaspartyl groups within the presenilin catalytic core of γ-secretase mediate the cleavage of different substrates.

This enzymatic activity, whose identity has been elusive for some years, is responsible for the production of the Aβ40/42 peptides. The deposition of insoluble aggregates of Aβ40/42, mainly Aβ42, results in the generation of amyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Aβ peptides are produced after a series of proteolytic cleavages of the precursor βAPP, a type I transmembrane (TM) protein. Cleavage of βAPP by α- and β-secretases generates the α and β C-terminal fragments (α-CTF and β-CTF, respectively), which are the substrates of γ-secretase. The intramembrane proteolytic cleavage by γ-secretase on α-CTF generates the soluble p3 peptide, whereas the same cleavage on β-CTF generates the Aβ peptides. The more abundant Aβ peptide forms, Aβ40 and Aβ42/43, are produced in a 9:1 ratio (reviewed in Ref. 3De Strooper B. Annaert W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the presenilin 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2) genes cause familiar autosomal dominant AD (FAD), and to date, up to 145 missense mutations have been reported (available on the World Wide Web at molgen-www.uia.ac.be/ADMutations/). These mutations, scattered throughout the coding sequence, trigger a shift in the ratio of Aβ40/42 production in favor of the longer peptide form (Aβ42/43) (4Borchelt D.R. Thinakaran G. Eckman C.B.

AICD translocates to the nucleus, where, together with other recruited proteins, it initiates transcriptional events (9Cao X. Sudhof T.C.

This proteolytic cleavage, also within the TM region, is a key step in Notch signal transduction, since it releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (11De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). The analogous Notch S3 and APP ϵ sites are located within the TM region near the cytoplasmic domain (7Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol.

In addition, Notch also undergoes an additional γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis in the middle of the transmembrane region (S4 site), analogous to the Aβ-producing γ-secretase cleavage (12Okochi M.

It is now widely accepted that PS1 and PS2 are the catalytic components of the γ-secretase complex, which appears to be an aspartyl protease whose activity resides at the interface between two presenilin fragments, the N-terminal (NTF) and the C-terminal (CTF) fragments (13Esler W.P.

Many biochemical properties of γ-secretase activity are poorly understood, the most perplexing being its ability to cleave at two different sites within the transmembrane region of its substrates (the γ and ϵ cleavages of βAPP and the S3 and S4 sites of Notch) and the heterogeneity of the cleavage at the γ-site, which yields Aβ peptides ranging from 32 to 43 amino acids (21Wang R.

Although the presenilin catalytic center is composed of a diaspartyl group, the different inhibitory profiles of γ-secretase inhibitors obtained for Aβ40, Aβ42, and Notch cleavage suggest the presence of distinct catalytic activities (22Citron M.

In addition, some presenilin FAD and non-FAD mutations behave as gain-of-function mutations with respect to Aβ production and as loss-of-function mutations with respect to AICD and NICD release (25Moehlmann T.

Nonetheless, and despite the wealth of information gathered, there is still a lack of knowledge about the mechanism(s) by which FAD presenilin mutations, mainly located far from the catalytic site, are translated into subtle modifications in γ-secretase cleavage preferences. Studies with different inhibitors have shed some light on the presenilin catalytic mechanism (31Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol.

However, many issues related to substrate specificity, cleavage site specificity, and substrate binding site (or sites) remain to be clarified. Several scenarios have been postulated to explain these intriguing findings. Some reports argue that γ-secretase catalytic properties are incompatible with a single catalytic activity and propose that Notch and βAPP are cleaved by different proteases or by a protease with different catalytic sites (36Chen F.

In contrast, other authors propose that γ-secretase activity is performed by a unique, albeit particularly complex, enzyme. This latter model has been recently expanded, since several newly described isoforms of some components of γ-secretase might allow the formation of more than four different variants of the γ-secretase complex (40De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). A new view of the γ-secretase complex was put forward by our group and others, providing evidence that the functional γ-secretase core contains two presenilin molecules (26Schroeter E.H. Ilagan M.X.

Gonzalez-Duarte R. Marfany G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the hydrophobic transmembrane regions of presenilin contribute to the interactions within the dimer and that alterations of the dimer not related to the catalytic site, such as that affecting the HL1 domain, impair γ-secretase function. In addition, by reconstituting γ-secretase activity from two catalytically inactive presenilin aspartic mutants, we demonstrate that a functional diaspartyl catalytic group is formed at the interface of the NTF and CTF moieties from two different presenilin molecules. DNA Constructs—The initial split ubiquitin constructs containing the wild-type Drosophila PSN NTF (amino acids 1–322) and CTF (amino acids 321–541) were generated from the Nub- and Cub-derived constructs (44Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. teHeesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) as described elsewhere (41Cervantes S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Marfany G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, a yeast centromeric plasmid was used to constitutively express the PSN NTF- or PSN CTF-derived constructs, which were fused in-frame to Cub-ProtA-LexA-Vp16. The fusion constructs containing NubG fused to PSN NTF and to PSN CTF were cloned into a multicopy yeast plasmid under the control of the inducible CUP1 promoter. All the presenilin variants analyzed here were generated by combining the corresponding PCR fragments in-frame, and the integrity of the coding sequence was confirmed by sequencing on the final construct. To generate the constructs to be expressed in SL2 cells, an in-frame fusion containing an HA N-terminal tagged Drosophila presenilin (H-A-Psn) in pACT-2 (pACT-Psn) was subcloned into the expression vector pActPPA (kindly provided by Dr. A. Vaquero) to drive the expression of HA-PSN from a Drosophila actin 5C expression cassette. For the expression constructs bearing the N-terminal c-Myc-tagged Psn, a forward strand oligonucleotide (5′-CATGGAGGAACAAAAGCTGATTTCTGAAGAAGACTTGG-3′) and its complementary reverse strand oligonucleotide (5′-AATTCCAAGTCTTCTTCAGAAATCAGCTTTTGTTCCTC-3′), coding for the c-Myc epitope, were annealed and cloned into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pAS2–1-Psn. The entire c-Myc-Psn fusion was subcloned into pActPPA expression vector. The aspartic mutant PSNs were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the Psn template as described elsewhere (45Cols N. Marfany G. Atrian S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the in-frame substitution of HL1 (amino acids 123–154) by HL5 (amino acids 261–267), a two-step cloning strategy was used. The resulting Psn cDNA, containing an N-terminal HA tag and the HL5 region after TMI, was cloned into a pActPPA expression plasmid to generate pActPPA-HA-PsnHL1–5. The pActPPA expression plasmids containing two Psn expression cassettes were obtained by subcloning the SalI fragment, containing the actin 5C expression cassette driving the expression of a c-Myc-tagged PSN, into the unique BstZ17I site of the plasmid pActPPA-HA-Psn. For the ϵ-cleavage reporter assay of the Drosophila NECN, a NECN-GV3 construct in pBluescript SK was obtained by substituting the 400-bp AatII fragment from OGG513 with the 1.1-kb AatII fragment containing Gal4Vp16 from N932. Both plasmids, OGG513 and N932, were kindly provided by Dr. G. Struhl and had been tested in vivo in Drosophila (46Struhl G. Adachi A. Cell. 1998; 93: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The NECN-GV3 fusion was subcloned into the KpnI/EcoRV sites of pActPPA. A C99-Gal4Vp16 construct in pCDNA3.1 was kindly provided by Dr. J. Lundkvist (47Karlstrom H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Naslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol.

Tomita (48Takasugi N. Takahashi Y. Morohashi Y. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50198-50205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The integrity and conserved reading frame of all DNA constructs were confirmed by sequencing with PerkinElmer Life Sciences Big Dye 2.1 using a 3700 or 3730 DNA analyzer. Split Ubiquitin Assay—Yeast strain L40 was cotransformed with the corresponding Nub- and Cub-derived constructs (44Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. teHeesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) using the standard lithium acetate procedure. Transformants were selected for growth on SD–His/–Trp/–Leu supplemented with 25 mm 3-aminotriazole and 0.2 mm Cu2+. When necessary, protein/protein interactions were quantified by assessment of β-galactosidase activity (reporter gene) in liquid culture using o-nitrophenyl p-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate following standard procedures. Cell Culture and Transfection—Drosophila Schneider's 2 cell line (SL2 cells) was maintained in Drosophila Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. Transient transfections were performed with 4 μg of DNA and Cellfectin (Invitrogen) in 35-mm plates or 6-well plates following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection. For stable transfections, the corresponding pActPPA expression plasmid was cotransfected with pCoHygro, kindly provided by Dr. D. Huertas. Two days post-transfection, cells were selected with 125 μg/μl of hygromycin (Invitrogen) for 3 weeks, and from then on, stable cell lines were expanded. Cycloheximide treatment was performed as follows: 1 × 107 cells of each cell line were seeded in 60-mm plates and were allowed to attach to the plate surface. Subsequently, medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells from each 60-mm plate were then harvested at the specified time points, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen at –80 °C for further analysis. RNA Interference Experiments—A dsRNA corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of the Drosophila presenilin gene was obtained by in vitro transcription from pBluescript SK in which the 5′ (144 bp) and 3′ (106 bp) Psn UTR sequence had been previously cloned. This dsRNA was specifically targeted to disrupt endogenous presenilin expression without affecting exogenous presenilin, since the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of the latter were provided by the expression vector. Briefly, transcription from the T7 and the T3 promoter yielded forward and reverse single-stranded RNAs, respectively. The two complementary RNA strands were then annealed by heating for 10 min at 70 °C and subsequent incubation for 10 min at 37 °C to obtain the 250-bp 5′-UTR-3′-UTR dsRNA. Either 1 or 2 μg of dsRNA were co-transfected with the specified DNA constructs up to 4 μg of DNA/dsRNA mixture with Cellfectin as described above. Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection to allow both protein turnover and RNA interference of the residual endogenous presenilin. Protein Extractions and Immunoblotting—Stable and transiently transfected cells were harvested and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. For HA-PSN detection, total proteins were extracted in 250 μl for a 35-mm plate of transiently transfected cells, or 500 μl for a 25-cm2 flask or 60-mm plate of stably transfected cells, in lysis buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor mixture) and sonicated for 20 s on ice using a Branson sonicator 250. Insoluble proteins and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. For immunoblotting, 10 μg of protein extracts were loaded onto a 6 m urea SDS-PAGE, transferred into a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunodetected with the monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Babco). For c-Myc-PSN analysis, cell membranes were extracted with 0.5% dodecyl maltoside buffer as follows. Cells were resuspended in the volumes of homogenization buffer I (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 2% Brij-35, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors) indicated above and subjected to mechanical lysis in a Polytron homogenizer. A presenilin-enriched membrane fraction was obtained by subsequent centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. PSN was solubilized from the membrane pellet in 50 or 100 μl of buffer II (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) for 20–60 min on ice. Subsequently, total protein concentration was quantified using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay, and, after a clarifying spin, 20 μg of protein was subjected to electrophoresis as above. c-Myc-PSN was immunodetected with the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). For detection of APP CTFs, protein extracts were prepared from Drosophila Schneider (SL2) cells by lysis on ice in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma). Lysates were sonicated, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein extracts (10 μg) were mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer and resolved on 4–20% Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen). For immunoblot analysis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer (10% nonfat milk, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) followed by incubation with primary polyclonal antiserum specific for the C-terminal (residues 665–695) of APP (“Saeko”; 1:10,000) (49Kawarabayashi T.

Aging. 1996; 17: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). APP CTFs were detected with the ECL plus chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The density of each band was quantified using NIH Image software and normalized to α-tubulin (Sigma). The data represent the average ± S.E. of three independent experiments. ϵ-Cleavage of C99 and S3 Cleavage of NECN Substrates—Co-expression of the C99-Gal4Vp16 or NECN-Gal4Vp16 fusion proteins, which are substrates for γ-secretase, together with the hsp70mp-5×G4-βgal reporter construct (hereafter referred to as hsp70-UAS-βgal), allowed quantification of presenilin-mediated cleavage. Stably transfected cells expressing presenilin constructs were transiently transfected with 2.3 μg of C99-Gal4Vp16, 500 ng of hsp70-UAS-β-gal, 200 ng of a cytomegalovirusluciferase control plasmid, and 1 μg of dsRNA.

Here we show that the Reg1-interacting proteins Bmh1, Bmh2, Ssb1, and Ssb2 have roles in glucose repression. Deleting both BMH genes causes partially constitutive ADH2 expression without significantly increasing the level of Adr1 protein, the major activator of ADH2 expression. Adr1 and Bcy1, the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, are both required for this effect indicating that constitutive expression in Δbmh1Δbmh2 cells uses the same activation pathway that operates in Δreg1 cells. Deletion of both BMH genes and REG1 causes a synergistic relief from repression, suggesting that Bmh proteins also act independently of Reg1 during glucose repression. A two-hybrid interaction with the Bmh proteins was mapped to amino acids 187-232, a region of Reg1 that is conserved in different classes of fungi. Deleting this region partially releases SUC2 from glucose repression. This indicates a role for the Reg1-Bmh interaction in glucose repression and also suggests a broad role for Bmh proteins in this process. An in vivo Reg1-Bmh interaction was confirmed by copurification of Bmh proteins with HA3-TAP-tagged Reg1. The nonconventional heat shock proteins Ssb1 and Ssb2 are also copurified with HA3-TAP-tagged Reg1.

In order to survive without glucose, their preferred carbon and energy source, yeast cells adapt their metabolic pathways to utilize alternative carbon sources (1DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O.

One component of this pathway is a type I protein phosphatase complex composed of the PP1 catalytic subunit, Glc7, and its associated regulatory subunit, Reg1 (8Tu J. Carlson M.

This motif has a general consensus sequence of (R/K)X0-1(V/I)(P)(F/W), where X represents any amino acid and (P) is any amino acid except proline (11Wakula P. Beullens M. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18817-18823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The RHIHF sequence, present at amino acids 464-468 of Reg1, matches this general consensus sequence and is required for binding to Glc7 and for maintaining glucose repression (12Alms G.R. Sanz P. Carlson M. Haystead T.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4157-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Dombek K.M. Voronkova V. Raney A. Young E.T. Mol. Cell.

Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2142) Google Scholar). For Reg1, these targets appear to be proteins involved in glucose repression (8Tu J. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), including Snf1, the yeast AMP-activated protein kinase required for release of most glucose-repressible genes from repression (2Young E.T.

Phosphorylation of Thr210 in the activation loop of the Snf1 kinase by the Pak1, Elm1, or Tos3 kinases is required for activating kinase activity (15McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 16Nath N. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Mol. Cell.

A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Reg1 interacts with the kinase domain of activated Snf1, directing Glc7 phosphatase activity to the kinase activation loop (18Ludin K. Jiang R. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6245-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). When glucose in the growth medium becomes abundant, the Glc7 phosphatase is activated by an unknown mechanism, and Thr210 is dephosphorylated, causing Snf1 to assume an inactive closed conformation (15McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).Little is known about how the activity of Reg1-Glc7 might be regulated. Neither expression nor subcellular localization of Reg1 is regulated by a carbon source (1DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar, 13Dombek K.M. Voronkova V. Raney A. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6029-6040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Niederacher D. Entian K.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). There is also no direct evidence indicating that the interaction of Reg1 with Glc7 is significantly regulated by a carbon source (8Tu J. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The activity of Reg1-Glc7 might be regulated by post-translational phosphorylation of Reg1. Reg1 is phosphorylated in a carbon source-dependent manner, and this phosphorylation is Snf1-dependent (20Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Reg1 is not phosphorylated in cells lacking Hxk2, the isozyme of hexokinase implicated in glucose repression (21Bisson L.F. Kunathigan V. Res. Microbiol. 2003; 154: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and its interaction with Snf1 is weakened (20Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This suggests that Hxk2-dependent phosphorylation of Reg1 may regulate the interaction with and, presumably, the activity of Snf1. A major caveat to this conclusion is that phosphorylation was assessed using proteins expressed from the strong ADH1 promoter and primarily utilized LexA-Reg1 fusions that were targeted to the nucleus, a cellular compartment from which Reg1 appears to be excluded (13Dombek K.M. Voronkova V. Raney A. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6029-6040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion also suggests that expression of genes controlled by Snf1 and Reg1 should be co-regulated by Hxk2. Repression of ADH2, the gene encoding the glucose repressible alcohol dehydrogenase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is not relieved in cells expressing an allele of HXK2 that is defective in the repression of other genes by glucose (22Dombek K.M. Camier S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Repression is partially relieved, however, in cells lacking Reg1, and this requires Snf1 (22Dombek K.M. Camier S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ciriacy M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 176: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of glucose-regulated phosphorylation in the control of Reg1-Glc7 activity remains unclear.In order to expand our understanding of how the Reg1-Glc7 phosphatase is regulated and to identify new targets or processes controlled by this complex, we and others have performed yeast genomic two-hybrid library screens looking for proteins that interact with Reg1 (24Mayordomo I. Regelmann J. Horak J. Sanz P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 2K. M. Dombek, data not shown. These screens identified the yeast homologs of mammalian 14-3-3 proteins, Bmh1 and Bmh2, and the nonconventional heat shock proteins, Ssb1 and Ssb2, as putative Reg1-binding proteins. Since 14-3-3 proteins play roles in other signal transduction pathways (25Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) and the role of Ssb proteins in signal transduction is uncertain, the Reg1-Bmh interaction and the role of Bmh proteins in glucose repression were further characterized (24Mayordomo I. Regelmann J. Horak J. Sanz P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The interaction with Bmh2 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays using highly expressed tagged proteins and was shown to require the N-terminal 313 amino acids of Reg1. However, no role for Bmh protein in glucose repression could be demonstrated. The interaction with Reg1 was not regulated by glucose availability, and glucose-repressible SUC2 expression was not released from repression in Δbmh1Δbmh2 cells.In this study, we show that Bmh proteins do play a role in glucose repression in S. cerevisiae and that for SUC2 expression the interaction with Reg1 is required to maintain complete repression. The region of Reg1 that interacts with Bmh protein was mapped to amino acids 187-232 of the N terminus, a region that is evolutionarily conserved among fungi. Copurification of Bmh proteins with HA3-TAP-tagged Reg1 protein expressed at physiological levels from the chromosomal locus confirmed that Reg1 and Bmh proteins interact in vivo. Ssb proteins also copurified with HA3-TAP-tagged Reg1. Deletion of SSB1 and SSB2 caused a modest relief of ADH2 expression from glucose repression, providing evidence that Ssb proteins play a minor role in this process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMedia and Growth Conditions—Media and culture conditions were essentially as described by Sherman (26Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in YEP medium as described previously (22Dombek K.M. Camier S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells having URA3-selectable plasmids were grown in synthetic medium lacking amino acids and uracil and containing 0.4% (w/v) casamino acids and 40 μg/ml tryptophan. Cells having URA3- and LEU2-selectable plasmids were grown in the same medium with amino acid dropout solution lacking leucine instead of casamino acids and tryptophan. Repressing liquid medium contained 5% (w/v) glucose as the carbon source (YEPD or SD), and derepressing medium contained either 3% (v/v) ethanol in YEP broth (YEPE) or 0.05% glucose and 3% ethanol in synthetic medium broth. Agar plates were prepared using the same recipes as for liquid medium except that the glucose concentration was reduced to 2% (w/v). Selection for G418 or clonNat resistance was performed by plating cells on YEPD agar plates containing either 300 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem) or 100 μg/ml clonNat (Werner BioAgents, JENA-Cospeda, Germany), respectively.Yeast Strains and Their Construction—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Oligonucleotides used in strain constructions are listed in Table II. Newly created strains were constructed using standard genetic methods (30Guthrie C. Fink G.R.

A yeast strain in which the BMH1, BMH2, and REG1 genes are deleted was created by mating a MATα Δreg1::LEU2 random segregant obtained during the construction of KDY126 with RRY1216, sporulating the diploid, and then screening for random segregants having all three deletions. Small colonies that grew on SD plates lacking leucine and having colony morphologies similar to that of RRY1216 were isolated and tested by diagnostic PCR for the presence of the Δbmh1, Δbmh2, and Δreg1 deletions. Primers BMH1-A and BMH1-B were used to test for the wild type BMH1 gene, and primers BMH2-A and BMH2-B were used to test for the wild type BMH2 gene. The absence of PCR products with these two primer pairs along with the observation that these segregants had the same colony morphology as RRY1216 was taken as evidence that both BMH genes had been deleted. The presence of the Δreg1::LEU2 deletion in these segregants was confirmed by PCR as described previously (22Dombek K.M. Camier S. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The REG1 chromosomal locus of KDY121 was tagged at the 3′-end of its open reading frame with the HA3-TAP coding sequence by integrative transformation with a DNA fragment created by PCR. This fragment was generated by amplifying DNA sequence from plasmid pYM12-HA3-TAP using primers REG1-T5 and REG1-T3. Expression of HA3-TAP-tagged Reg1 protein in G418-resistant transformants was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science). Three independent transformants expressing the tagged protein were then tested for expression of an integrated ADH2-lacZ reporter plasmid by assaying β-galactosidase activity in permeabilized whole cells after growth in repressing YEPD broth and derepressing YEPE broth. All three transformants had levels of β-galactosidase equal to that of the untagged starting strain, KDY80. This indicated that the HA3-TAP-tagged Reg1 protein was fully functional and behaved identically to the untagged protein in repressing ADH2 expression.The yeast strain KDY157, which is of the BY4741 genetic background and has deletions of the SSB1 and SSB2 genes, was created by first introducing a Δssb2::natMX deletion into BY4742 using integrative transformation. The DNA fragment used in the transformation was created by PCR using primers SSB2_del-5′ and SSB2_del-3′ and pAG25 as the template (33Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Then one of the clonNat-resistant transformants was mated with BY4741Δssb1. The resulting diploid was sporulated, and random segregants were screened for the presence of both G418 and clonNat resistances. The absence of wild type SSB1 and SSB2 genes in these segregants was confirmed by diagnostic PCR with the primer pair SSB1-A and SSB1-B and the pair SSB2-A and SSB2-B, respectively. These segregants exhibited the slow growth phenotype reported for cells of the DS10 genetic background with the Δssb1Δssb2 deletions (34Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M.

Degradation of collagenous extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) plays a role in the pathogenesis of various destructive disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Here we show that group IB PLA2 increased pro-MMP-2 activation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. MMP-2 activity was stimulated by group IB PLA2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Consistent with MMP-2 activation, sPLA2 decreased expression of type IV collagen. These effects are due to the reduction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and the activation of the membrane type1-MMP (MT1-MMP). The decrease of TIMP-2 levels in conditioned media and the increase of MT1-MMP levels in plasma membrane were observed. In addition, treatment of cells with decanoyl Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, an inhibitor of pro-MT1-MMP, suppressed sPLA2-mediated MMP-2 activation, whereas treatment with bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of H+-ATPase, sustained MMP-2 activation by sPLA2. The involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt in the regulation of MMP-2 activity was further suggested by the findings that PI3K and Akt were phosphorylated by sPLA2. Expression of p85α and Akt mutants, or pretreatment of cells with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, attenuated sPLA2-induced MMP-2 activation and migration. Taken together, these results suggest that sPLA2 increases the pro-MMP-2 activation and migration of fibroblasts via the PI3K and Akt-dependent pathway. Because MMP-2 is an important factor directly involved in the control of cell migration and the turnover of extracellular matrix, our study may provide a mechanism for sPLA2-promoted fibroblasts migration.

Nevertheless, excessive breakdown of connective tissue plays an important role in pathogenesis, e.g. chronic inflammatory processes and malignancy (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 2Chang C. Werb Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 37-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) occurs on different levels, including gene expression, processing of the inactive proenzymes, and by inhibition of the active enzymes by their endogenous inhibitors delineated as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs are important breakdown enzymes of ECM components such as collagen. These enzymes consist of gelatinases, collagenases, stromelysins, and membrane-type MMPs. MMPs are synthesized as preproenzymes, and most of them are secreted from the cells as proenzymes. Among them, MMP-2 is thought to be one of the key enzymes for degrading collagen, which is a major component of basement membranes (3McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Med.

Transient fibroblast activation is probably regulated by a variety of mediators produced by infiltrating platelets, monocytes, and other inflammatory cells (6Ihn H. Tamaki K.J. J.

Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that some cytokines and growth factors regulate fibroblast proliferation and ECM deposition (6Ihn H. Tamaki K.J. J.

Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester bond in phospholipids as they generate free fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid (9Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Dennis E.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 10Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid is the key substrate for the synthesis of potent lipid mediators of inflammation. Several mammalian secretory PLA2s (sPLA2s) have been characterized and classified into different families (11Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Peilot H. Oorni K. Kovanen P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). At present, 12 distinct sPLA2s have been identified in mammals and classified into different groups, depending on their primary structures as characterized by the number and position of cysteine residues. Initially, sPLA2s were thought to carry out digestive functions. However, the recent reports of a class of high affinity cell surface PLA2 receptors and the delineation of novel receptor-mediated biological effects have changed this notion (12Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 13Cupillard L. Mulherkar R. Gomez N. Kadam S. Valentin E. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7043-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). PLA2 has been implicated in a wide range of cellular responses, including cell proliferation, signal transduction, host defense, chemokinesis, and membrane remodeling (14Kundu G.C. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2346-2353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Yuan C.J. Mandal A.K. Zhang Z. Mukherjee A.B.

In addition to an extensive understanding of its action in phospholipid hydrolysis, a role for sPLA2 has been suggested in the remodeling of ECM, although little evidence for such involvement has yet been published (14Kundu G.C. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2346-2353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A previous study reported that porcine pancreatic PLA2 promotes cell migration and ECM invasion via its high affinity receptor (14Kundu G.C. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2346-2353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Attiga et al. (16Attiga F.A. Fernandez P.M. Weeraratna A.T. Manyak M.J. Patierno S.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4629-4637PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the sPLA2 inhibitor p-bromophenacyl bromide could reduce the pro-MMP-2 and active MMP-2 from prostate cancer cells. All these results support the possible role of sPLA2 as a factor in MMP activation. However, the mechanism for this MMP-2 activation, including related TIMP in fibroblast, is not clear. Moreover, the intracellular signaling pathway that regulates MMP-2 expression has not been characterized. To investigate the role of group IB PLA2 on MMP-2 activation in fibroblasts, we established an MMP-2 activation profile by using the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3. In this study, we found that group IB PLA2 increases the activity of MMP-2 in cell conditioned medium and that this increase is the result of a decreased level of TIMP-2 protein and an increased level of MT1-MMP activity. Moreover, the sPLA2 regulation of MMP-2 seems to be mediated by PI3K and Akt. Because group IB PLA2 is involved in promoting NIH3T3 migration, our results suggest that sPLA2-promoted cell migration is mediated by MMP-2. Materials—Group IB PLA2, gelatin, and bafilomycin A1 were purchased from Sigma; the ECL reagent was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; RPMI 1640, LipofectAMINE 2000, and Opti-MEM were from Invitrogen; the MMP-2 ELISA kit was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); FCS was from Hyclone (Logan, UT); mouse polyclonal MMP-2, TIMP-2, type IV collagen, p85α subunit antibodies, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); the MT1-MMP antibody was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); the phospho-Akt antibody was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); the furin inhibitor decanoyl Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (dec-RVKR-cmk) was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA); and LY294002 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The latter was dissolved in Me2SO prior to adding to the cell cultures. The final Me2SO concentrations were 0.1% or less, and these concentrations had no effect on cell viability. Cell Culture—The NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS. The cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 fully humidified air and were subcultured twice weekly. They were then seeded in a 6-well plate at 3 × 105 cells/well and stimulated in the presence of group IB PLA2, with or without inhibitors, for various times ranging from a few minutes to 24 h. Zymogram Analysis—MMP-2 activity was determined by gelatin zymography using 0.1% gelatin as a substrate. The conditioned medium was mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer in the absence of reducing agent and electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed three times with 2.5% Triton X-100 in water and then incubated overnight in a closed container at 37 °C in 0.2% Brij 35, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The gels were stained for 30 min with 0.25% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 10% acetic acid and 45% methanol and then destained for 30 min using an aqueous mix of 20% acetic acid, 20% methanol, and 17% ethanol. Areas of protease activity appeared as clear bands. PI3K and Akt Activity Assay—NIH3T3 cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes and cultured overnight before they were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with or without group IB PLA2 for the indicated times. Whole-cell lysates were prepared in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture. For PI3K activity, 0.5 mg of total protein was incubated with phosphotyrosine Ab (4G10) for 4 h and then with protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing seven times in lysis buffer, the immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for subsequent immunoblot analysis by using p85 PI3K Ab. For Akt activity, immunoblotting was performed using Ab specific for the phosphorylated, activated forms of Akt. Transfection of Akt cDNA—Akt and K179M-Akt (DN-Akt) were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP. Plasmid DNAs (pSRα) encoding wild type and deletion mutant of p85α (Δp85 α, deletion of 479–513) were generously provided by Dr. Wataru Ogawa at Kobe University, Japan. LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent was used to transfect PI3K or Akt cDNA into NIH3T3 cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of the plasmid was mixed with 3 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 in 0.2 ml of Opti-MEM medium for 20 min and then added to the cells, which had grown to 40–50% confluency in the 6-well plate. After incubation for 6–18 h, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium. To obtain stable transfectants, the cells transfected with the cDNA were cloned by serial dilution in a culture medium containing 750 μg/ml G418 in a 96-well plate. The subculturing was continued for 4 weeks, and then wells representing a single colony were selected, and the expression was confirmed by using its protein as determined by Western blot analysis. Preparation of Plasma Membranes—For preparation of crude plasma membranes, the cells were harvested and suspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture, washed twice, and subjected to three cycles of freeze-thaw in dry ice/ethanol/37 °C baths. Lysates were sonicated for 3 s, and the nuclei and debris were removed from the homogenate by centrifugation at 1,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was solubilized in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)) for 1 h at 4 °C. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE for MT1-MMP expression. Western Blot Analysis—NIH3T3 cells were treated with group IB PLA2 for the indicated times and doses. The cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and pelleted at 700 × g at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture), and the preparation was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was retained as a whole-cell lysate. The protein was separated by 8% reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted in 20% methanol, 25 mm Tris, and 192 mm glycine to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) and subsequently incubated with the indicated antibodies for 4 h. The membrane was then washed and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, rewashed, and developed using an ECL system. Cell Migration—The effect of sPLA2 on cell migration was assessed by using a modified cell dispersion assay (17Gilles C. Polette M. Coraux C. Tournier J.-M. Meneguzzi G. Munaut C. Volders L. Rousselle P. Birembaut P. Foidart J.-M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were seeded and cultured in a 6-well plate containing a 6-mm glass ring. The cells were washed twice with serum-free media and serum-starved for an additional 12 h. After serum starvation, glass ring was removed, and the media were then switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing group IB PLA2. In selected experiments, the sPLA2 dependence of migration was determined by adding the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. To quantify the relative motility, the migratory front was photographed every 12 h for the indicated times, and the percentage of cells crossing a line designated “migration (%)” was enumerated. Activation of MMP-2 by Group IB PLA2 in NIH3T3 Fibroblast—Initially, we wanted to determine the effect of group IB PLA2 on MMP induction and activation in fibroblasts. MMP activity was measured in the conditioned medium by using standard zymography. To investigate the effects of sPLA2 on the induction of MMP-2 release and activation, time kinetic analysis was performed with mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells. The results indicated a significant response to the treatment at 6, 12, and 24 h (Fig. 1A). sPLA2 stimulated MMP-2 activity in a dose-dependent manner by zymography and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Therefore, further analysis was performed with supernatants at 24 h of culture. We further examined the total protein levels of MMP-2 and found that there was no dramatic change of MMP-2 protein by ELISA (Fig. 1C). An induction of the unknown band (85 kDa) was also detected by zymography in these experiments. However, MMP-9 was not detected under these experimental conditions, and therefore, no further studies on MMP-9 were conducted. To determine whether the induced MMP-2 activity was associated with collagen expression, Western blots were performed by using an antibody against type IV collagen. The collagen expression was carried out by treating the NIH3T3 cells with sPLA2. Fig. 1B shows the dose response of collagen expression as a function of cell treatment with varying concentrations of sPLA2. The decrease of collagen expression by sPLA2 is clearly dose-dependent and almost completely disappeared at an sPLA2 concentration of 50 nm. Involvement of TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP in the sPLA2-induced MMP-2 Activity—We speculated that the sPLA2-mediated MMP-2 activation in cells may be through the regulation of TIMP and MT-MMP. The latter was initially considered, because it has been demonstrated that TIMP-2 can form a complex with pro-MMP-2 through their carboxyl terminus (18Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Soloway P.D. Wang Z. Bigg H.F. Overall C.M. DeClerck Y.A. Tschesche H. Cher M.L. Brown S. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41415-41423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we measured sPLA2-stimulated TIMP-2 expression. The conditioned medium from NIH3T3 cells stimulated by sPLA2 was resolved by Western blot with monoclonal antibody against TIMP-2. As expected, TIMP-2 protein was strongly expressed at basal states, but this protein level was dramatically decreased by sPLA2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). We confirmed the effect of TIMP-2 on the activation of pro-MMP-2 by sPLA2. Cells were incubated with sPLA2 and recombinant TIMP-2 protein. Activation of pro-MMP-2 by sPLA2 was not enhanced in the presence of TIMP-2 at concentrations greater than 5 nm (Fig. 2B). MT1-MMP is a transmembrane MMP known to bind and activate pro-MMP-2 at the cell surface (19Seiki M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To determine the change of MT1-MMP activation in sPLA2 stimulation, we prepared plasma membrane fractions after treatment of sPLA2, and we performed Western blot analysis. The active form of MT1-MMP protein was increased by sPLA2 treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). To investigate the involvement of MT1-MMP in sPLA2-dependent pro-MMP-2 activation, cells were treated with a furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-cmk, which has been shown to block activation of pro-MT1-MMP (19Seiki M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 20Sato T. Kondo T. Seiki M. Ito A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 713-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21Hess A.R. Seftor E.A. Seftor R.E. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4757-4762PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with dec-RVKR-cmk inhibited sPLA2-mediated MMP-2 activation, implicating MT1-MMP in the sPLA2-induced pro-MMP-2 activation (Fig. 3B). A previous report (22Maquoi E. Peyrollier K. Noel A. Foidart J.M. Frankenne F. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) showed that the catalytic activity of MT1-MMP on the cell surface is regulated through a vacuolar H+-ATPase-dependent degradation process. To confirm whether or not the sPLA2-induced MMP-2 activation reflected enhanced MT1-MMP activation, the vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 was utilized. Cells were cultured in sPLA2 for 24 h in various concentrations of bafilomycin A1, and the conditioned media were collected, concentrated, and evaluated for MMP-2 activity by zymography and Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3C, bafilomycin A1 potentiated the sPLA2-induced pro-MMP-2 activation.Fig. 3sPLA2-induced pro-MMP-2 activation involves MT1-MMP. A, the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of sPLA2 for 24 h. The crude plasma membranes were isolated from each sample and subjected to Western blot with MT1-MMP antibody (10 μg/ml). The data shown are representative of two independent experiments. B, the cells were plated on 6-well plates, subjected to overnight serum starvation, and treated with 100 nm sPLA2 with the indicated concentrations of dec-RVKR-cmk. C, the cells were serum-starved overnight and incubated for an additional 24 h with 100 nm sPLA2 with the indicated concentrations of bafilomycin A1. The conditioned media were collected at 24 h and analyzed for MMP activity by gelatin zymography (zymo). Western blot (WB) was performed with anti-MMP-2 antibody. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MMP-2 Activation by sPLA2 Is Mediated through the PI3K and Akt Pathway but Not the MAPK Pathway—It has been suggested that PI3K plays a role in pro-MMP activation and cell migration in various cells (23Okkenhaug K. Vanhaesebroeck B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PI3K/Akt in MMP-2 regulation, sPLA2-treated cells were analyzed for activation of PI3K and Akt. Quiescent cells were exposed to 100 nm sPLA2 for different periods (0–30 min), and protein extracts were analyzed either by immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosine Ab for PI3K activity or by Western blot with phosphospecific Ab for Akt activity. Phosphorylation of PI3K by sPLA2 peaked at 5 min, whereas that of Akt began to occur within 3 min, peaked between 5 and 10 min, and then progressively declined to the basal level (Fig. 4, A and B). To gain insight into the mechanism of PI3K/Akt leading to pro-MMP-2 activation, cells were exposed to sPLA2 alone or in combination with the specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002. As shown in Fig. 5A, LY294002 dose-dependently suppressed the sPLA2-induced pro-MMP-2 activation. To confirm whether the sPLA2 signal was dependent on PI3K, cells were transfected with wild type p85α or the deletion mutant of p85α (Δp85α). NIH3T3 cells transfected with wild type p85α or Δp85α cDNA were exposed to sPLA2, and conditioned medium from these cells was assayed in order to measure MMP-2 activity. Overexpression of wild type p85α and Δp85α was checked by Western blot analysis. Overexpression of Δp85α resulted in significant attenuation of sPLA2 response. Moreover, the overexpression of wild type p85α resulted in an increase of MMP-2 activity by sPLA2 (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of exogenous expression of wild type or DN-Akt on the MMP-2 activation by sPLA2. The overexpression of the DN-Akt was also shown to inhibit sPLA2-induced MMP-2 activation, whereas the overexpression of wild type Akt potentiated sPLA2-induced MMP-2 activation (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5PI3K and Akt are linked to sPLA2-induced pro-MMP-2 activation. A, cells were serum-starved overnight and incubated for an additional 24 h with 100 nm sPLA2 with the indicated concentrations of LY294002. The conditioned media were collected at 24 h and analyzed for MMP activity by gelatin zymography. B and C, cells were transfected with a control vector (pSRα), wild type p85α, or Δp85α (B). Cells were transfected with a control vector (pEGFP), wild type Akt, or DN-Akt (C). Cells were stimulated with 100 nm sPLA2 for 24 h, and whole-cell lysates were obtained. Western blot analysis was performed by using p85 or Akt antibody. The conditioned media were collected at 24 h and analyzed for MMP activity by gelatin zymography. The data shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is also central to sPLA2-induced cell proliferation, we were interested in defining the role of ERK in the stimulation of pro-MMP-2 activity. Quiescent cells were exposed to 100 nm sPLA2 for different times (3–30 min), and protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with phosphospecific antibody. sPLA2-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 occurred within 5 min, peaked between 10 and 20 min, and then progressively declined. In addition, sPLA2 stimulated phosphorylation of p38 over a similar period to the time kinetics of the ERK activation (Fig. 6A). To gain insight into the mechanism of sPLA2 signaling leading to pro-MMP-2 activation, cells were exposed to sPLA2 alone or in combination with each specific inhibitor. The results of zymography demonstrated that none of them had any effect on the sPLA2-induced MMP activation (Fig. 6B). These results suggested that sPLA2 acts through the PI3K/Akt pathway, rather than the MAPK pathway, to activate pro-MMP-2. sPLA2 Stimulates Cell Migration via a PI3K- and Akt-dependent Pathway—A critical response of skin fibroblasts during wound healing is their migration into regions of repair and remodeling. For migration, fibroblasts must degrade the surrounding basement membrane, rich in type IV collagen (24Ellerbroek S.M. Halbleib J.M. Benavidez M. Warmka J.K. Wattenberg E.V. Stack M.S. Hudson L.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1855-1861PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mackay A.R. Corbitt R.H. Hartzler J.L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5997-6001PubMed Google Scholar), which is the principal substrate for MMP-2. To evaluate the functional consequences of sPLA2-induced MMP-2 activation, the effect of sPLA2 on NIH3T3 cell migration was examined. Migration was quantified by using an in vitro cell dispersion assay, in which cells are plated at high density in a hole made in the middle of a 6-well plate and allowed to migrate after sPLA2 treatment. Cell migration was greatly increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). Previous results have suggested that active MMP-2 mediates cell migration (14Kundu G.C. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2346-2353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus far, our results have led us to speculate that PI3K and Akt are able to regulate the stimulation of migration through MMP-2, and we therefore sought to investigate the possibility that PI3K could mediate the stimulation of sPLA2-associated cell migration. To determine whether migration was PI3K and Akt-dependent, the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 was added, which greatly reduced cell migration (Fig, 7B). To confirm whether the sPLA2-stimulated cell migration was dependent on PI3K and Akt, cells were transfected with wild type or dominant negative mutants of p85α and Akt. Overexpression of the Δp85α or DN-Akt was also shown to inhibit sPLA2-induced cell migration, whereas overexpression of wild type p85α or Akt potentiated sPLA2-induced cell migration (Fig. 7C). These data suggest that the PI3K and Akt pathway is able to regulate the cleavage of collagen through MMP-2 and ultimately affects fibroblast migration. Group IB PLA2 has been identified as a mitogen for fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, chondrocytes, and synovial cells (26Ortega N. Werb Z. J.

https://openalex.org/W2025090870,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae OLE1 gene encodes a membrane-bound Δ9 fatty-acid desaturase, whose expression is regulated through transcriptional and mRNA stability controls. In wild type cells grown on fatty acid-free medium, OLE1 mRNA has a half-life of 10 ± 1.5 min (basal stability) that becomes highly unstable when cells are exposed to unsaturated fatty acids (regulated stability). Activation of OLE1 transcription is dependent on N-terminal fragments of two membrane proteins, Mga2p and Spt23p, that are proteolytically released from the membrane by a ubiquitin-mediated mechanism. Surprisingly, disruption of the MGA2 gene also reduces the half-life of the OLE1 transcript and abolishes fatty acid regulated instability. Disruption of its cognate, SPT23, has no effect on the half-life of the mRNA. Mga2p appears to have two distinct functions with respect to the OLE1 mRNA stability: a stabilizing effect in cells grown in fatty acid-free medium and a destabilizing function in cells that are exposed to unsaturated fatty acids. These functions are independent of OLE1 transcription and can confer basal and regulated stability on OLE1 mRNAs that are produced under the control of the unrelated GAL1 promoter. Expression of soluble, N-terminal fragments of Mga2p stabilize the transcript but do not confer fatty acid-regulated instability on the mRNA suggesting that the stabilizing functions of Mga2p do not require membrane processing and that modifications to the protein introduced during proteolysis may play a role in the destabilizing effect. An analysis of mutants that are defective in mRNA degradation indicate that the Mga2p-requiring control mechanism that regulates the fatty acid-mediated instability of the OLE1 transcript acts by activating exosomal 3′ → 5′-exonuclease degradation activity.

Unsaturated fatty acids are formed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Ole1p, a membrane-bound Δ9 fatty-acid desaturase that converts long chain saturated fatty acyl-CoA substrates into monounsaturated species (1Stukey J.E.

Recently, the expression of Ole1p was found to be dependent on two homologous ER membrane proteins, Mga2p and Spt23p (3Zhang S. Skalsky Y. Garfinkel D.J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 473-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These are cleaved from the membrane by a novel ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic mechanism that releases soluble N-terminal polypeptides (4Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Although neither protein appears to have a DNA binding domain, the N-terminal fragments specifically activate OLE1 transcription presumably by influencing chromatin structure or by associating with DNA binding proteins that are bound to elements on the OLE1 promoter (5Jiang Y.

Disruption of either SPT23 or MGA2 does not affect the growth rate or production of fatty acids under normal laboratory growth conditions (7Chellappa R. Kandasamy P. Oh C.S. Jiang Y. Vemula M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43548-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Disruption of both genes, however, blocks expression of Ole1p and results in a synthetic auxotrophy that can be overcome by adding unsaturated fatty acids to the medium or expressing OLE1 under a different promoter (4Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Evidence for the direct role of Mga2p in OLE1 transcription has been provided in studies by Jiang et al. (5Jiang Y. Vasconcelles M.J. Wretzel S. Light A. Martin C.E. Goldberg M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6161-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that under conditions where OLE1 expression is induced by oxygen starvation, Mga2p is associated with the low oxygen response element in the OLE1 promoter. In this study we show that, in addition to its role in the activation of OLE1 transcription, Mga2p but not Spt23p is linked to mechanisms that stabilize the OLE1 mRNA under fatty acid-free growth conditions and is essential for its regulated instability in cells exposed to unsaturated acids via mechanisms that require 3′ → 5′-exosomal mRNA degradation activity. Furthermore, whereas expression of soluble, N-terminal fragments of Mga2p stabilize the OLE1 transcript, those mRNAs are not destabilized by unsaturated fatty acids suggesting that post-translational modifications associated with the proteolytic processing of Mga2p may play a role in fatty acid-regulated mRNA stability.

The cells were grown at 30 °C in complete synthetic medium + 1% Tergitol Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) lacking appropriate amino acids (based on the selectable marker used in the incorporated plasmid). Typically, the carbon source was 2% glucose. However, when the cells contained the gene of interest fused to a galactose-inducible promoter, they were grown overnight in medium containing 2% raffinose. 2% galactose or 2% glucose was added to the growth medium when required to induce or repress transcription of genes under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Unsaturated fatty acids (obtained from Sigma) were added to the growth medium to a final concentration of 1 mm. Thiolutin (a gift from Pfizer) was added to a final concentration of 15 μg/ml. DNA Isolation and Manipulations—Methods for general DNA manipulations were performed according to standard procedures described in Ausubel et al. (8Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

Transcription of the native OLE1 gene was arrested by using the transcriptional inhibitor thiolutin (15 μg/ml). Measurements of the half-life of the OLE1 mRNA produced under control of the yeast GAL1 promoter were conducted by initially growing cells on raffinose as a carbon source. Transcription of the OLE1 mRNA was induced by the addition of 2% galactose and then arrested by adding 2% glucose. RNA isolations and quantitative Northern blot analysis of cells following transcription arrest were performed as described previously (10Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol.

All DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× Tris acetate-EDTA buffer and purified by Gene Clean II (Bio 101). The DNA fragments were labeled to high specific activity with [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by the random primer extension method using the NE-Blot kit from New England Biolabs. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed from the sample using a Sephadex G-50 spin column. The specific activities of labeled probes were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Analyses of Data—Statistical analyses were performed with Sigma-Plot software. Statistical significance was determined by performing the Student's t test. p values <0.05 were taken as a significant difference. Mga2p but Not Spt23p Is Required for the Fatty Acid-Mediated Regulation of OLE1 mRNA Stability—Mga2p and Spt23p are two homologous proteins that are required for the transcriptional activation and expression of the OLE1 gene (3Zhang S. Skalsky Y. Garfinkel D.J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 473-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To test the individual effects of Spt23p- and Mga2p-induced expression on OLE1 mRNA stability, the decay kinetics of the native transcript were determined in cells containing a disrupted form of each gene (Fig. 1). Cells that contained a functional MGA2 gene and a disrupted SPT23 gene (spt23Δ;MGA2) exhibited the normal pattern of basal and regulated OLE1 mRNA decay with an average half-life of 10.5 min when grown in fatty acid-depleted medium and 4.5 min after exposure to fatty acids. By contrast, cells that contain the wild type SPT23 gene and a disrupted MGA2 gene (SPT23;mga2Δ) showed identical half-lives of 6 min under fatty acid-deprived and fatty acid-exposed conditions, indicating that the basal stability and regulated instability was lost. These data indicate that Mga2p acts in this regulation system in two ways: to stabilize the OLE1 transcript in cells grown on fatty acid-depleted medium and to destabilize it when cells are exposed to unsaturated fatty acids. This pattern of behavior might occur either through a direct physical association of Mga2p with the OLE1 transcript or indirectly by the action of Mga2p through some regulatory pathway that alters the nature of the mRNA decay. OLE1 transcription is activated through two promoter regions designated as the FAR and LORE elements (5Jiang Y. Vasconcelles M.J. Wretzel S. Light A. Martin C.E. Goldberg M.A. Mol. Cell.

Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6161-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Mga2p associates with the LORE element under hypoxic induction conditions, it is not clear whether Spt23p and/or Mga2p associate with those regions under other growth conditions. To determine whether the effects of Spt23p or Mga2p on mRNA stability of OLE1 require the activation of the transcription of its mRNA through these or other elements in the OLE1 promoter, we tested the stability of the OLE1 transcript produced under the control of the unrelated GAL1 promoter sequences (Fig. 2). We have shown previously that in wild type cells the half-life of OLE1 mRNA expressed under the control of the GAL1 promoter is similar to that of the native transcript, yielding a basal half-life of 10–12 min and a regulated half-life of <2 min (10Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25801-25809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Vemula M. Kandasamy P. Oh C.S. Chellappa R. Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45269-45279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In experiments where OLE1 was expressed under the control of GAL1 promoter in an mga2Δ;SPT23 strain (Fig. 2a), the half-life of the transcript in both the absence and presence of fatty acids was 6 min, which correlates with the loss of basal and regulated stability exhibited by the native transcript in cells lacking Mga2p. By contrast, in spt23Δ;MGA2 cells, the average half-life of the GAL1 expressed transcript was 11 min in fatty acid-free medium and 4.5 min in cells exposed to 18:2 (Fig. 2b). These data indicate that the effects of Mga2p on the basal and regulated decay of OLE1 mRNA occur independently of its effects on OLE transcription activation through elements in the OLE1 promoter. To test whether Spt23p contributed to overall OLE1 mRNA stability in the absence of Mga2p, we also used the GAL1 expressed OLE1 mRNA to measure its rate of decay in a strain containing disrupted forms of both genes. Under both conditions, the half-life of the transcript produced by plasmid pGAL-OLE2.8 was similar to those measured in the mga2Δ strains (Fig. 2c). Thus, even though Spt23p has substantial sequence and structural homology Mga2p, it does not appear to contribute to the basal or fatty acid-mediated regulation of OLE1 mRNA stability. Expression of Soluble, N-terminal Fragments of Mga2p Stabilize OLE1 mRNA—Fatty acid-mediated instability of the transcript, however, requires expression of the full-length, membrane-bound form of the protein. Spt23p and Mga2p are intrinsic ER membrane proteins that are integrated into the membrane through a C-terminal membrane spanning domain (4Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 7Chellappa R. Kandasamy P. Oh C.S. Jiang Y. Vemula M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43548-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Both proteins are cleaved by a novel ubiquitin-mediated mechanism that releases soluble N-terminal fragments from the membrane (4Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These translocate to the nucleus and activate OLE1 expression. To determine whether the proteolytic processing of the membrane-bound Mga2p is required for regulated OLE1 mRNA stability, we tested the effects of two soluble forms of Mga2p with C-terminal deletions that are expressed under the control of their native promoter (Fig. 3A). Plasmid p87 expresses an approximate 87-kDa soluble Mga2p polypeptide that is truncated below the presumptive ankyrin repeat regions of the protein. Plasmid p103 expresses an approximate 103-kDa N-terminal fragment of Mga2p that is truncated 89 residues upstream of its predicted C-terminal membrane spanning region. Both plasmids repair the unsaturated fatty acid requirement when expressed in a spt23Δ;mga2Δ strain (Fig. 3B). Tests of both plasmids expressed under the control of the MGA2 native promoter sequences in an spt23Δ; mga2Δ strain showed that the native OLE1 mRNA became more stable, exhibiting half-lives of >15 min under no fatty acid- and 18:2-supplemented conditions (Fig. 4). To determine the actual half-life of the OLE1 under those conditions, the mRNA stability assay was extended to 120 min in cells containing the p103 plasmid (Fig. 4). Those assays indicated that under both basal and regulated conditions, the half-life was ∼20 min. Quite surprisingly, these results show that expression of the Mga2p soluble N-terminal fragments is sufficient to stabilize the OLE1 transcript but has no effect in triggering its fatty acid-mediated instability.Fig. 4OLE1 mRNA decay in an mga2Δ;spt23Δ strain expressing a soluble, 87-kDa or 103-kDa N-terminal fragment of Mga2p under the control of its native promoter. The OLE1 transcript is expressed under the control of its native promoter in cells grown on glucose. Transcription of OLE1 was arrested with the addition of thiolutin as described in Fig. 1. For the cells expressing the p87 form of Mga2p, the actin gene mRNA (ACT1) was used as the internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mechanisms of Regulated OLE1 mRNA Decay—We attempted to examine the mechanisms under which Mga2p contributes to the stability and regulation of the OLE1 transcript. Previous studies in this laboratory suggested that the primary basal decay mechanism of OLE1 has features associated with the general mRNA decay pathway (16Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 17Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1075-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), which requires deadenylation-dependent decapping followed by degradation of the transcript by the 5′ → 3′-exonuclease, Xrn1p. A null mutation of the decapping enzyme, Dcp1p, makes the OLE1 transcript very stable under both basal and regulated conditions (t½ > 50 min/> 50 min), indicating that decapping of the transcript is an obligate feature of the OLE1 regulation system (15Vemula M. Kandasamy P. Oh C.S. Chellappa R. Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45269-45279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Similarly, a null mutation in Xrn1p stabilizes the transcript under basal conditions (t½ = 45 min). In those cells, however, the transcript is still destabilized by unsaturated fatty acids (t½ = 23 min) indicating that fatty acid-regulated decay proceeds via degradation mechanisms that are distinct from the general pathway (10Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25801-25809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Given that deadenylation of a number of mRNAs is required for the decapping reaction (16Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 17Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 18Tharun S. Parker R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1075-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we tested the effects of the loss of Ccr4p, the primary cytoplasmic deadenylase in yeast, to determine whether the fatty acid-regulated instability is a deadenylation dependent function (Fig. 5). As expected, under basal conditions the reduced deadenylation activity in those cells stabilized the transcript approximately 2-fold, increasing the basal half-life from 10 to 20 min. Exposing the cells to unsaturated fatty acids also resulted in a longer regulated half-life (7 min) relative to wild type cells. The net effect of stimulation by the fatty acids, however, was to strongly destabilize the transcript, inducing a net 3-fold increase in the mRNA degradation rate over basal conditions. These results indicated that Ccr4p mediated deadenylation activity is not required to trigger fatty acid-regulated instability. An alternative, nonsense-mediated decay pathway in yeast and other eukaryotes is associated with the decay of aberrant transcripts that contain premature stop codons and other features that prevent normal translation (19He F. Li X. Spatrick P. Casillo R. Dong S. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1439-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We showed previously by introducing stop codons at different positions within the protein coding sequence that the OLE1 transcript is unusually resistant to this pathway (15Vemula M. Kandasamy P. Oh C.S. Chellappa R. Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45269-45279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To test whether the downstream components of that regulation system might be required for the regulated decay of the normal OLE1 transcript, however, we examined the half-lives of OLE1 mRNA in cells containing a null mutation of the UPF1 gene (Fig. 5), which blocks nonsense mediated decay. Deletion of Upf1p did not significantly change the OLE1 degradation rate under basal conditions (p value = 0.82) but did produce a 2-fold increase in the fatty acid-regulated half-life (from 2.5 min to 5 min). Furthermore, the OLE1 transcript clearly exhibits a strong fatty acid-regulated response in upf1Δ cells (Fig. 5), indicating that the nonsense-mediated decay pathway is not required to induce fatty acid-regulated instability. The finding that regulated decay of OLE1 mRNA requires decapping, but does not require the Xrn1p 5′ → 3′-exonuclease suggested that the regulated instability of OLE1 may involve the activation of exosomal 3′ → 5′-exonuclease activities. Exosomes are complex protein particles that play multiple roles in the processing and degradation of small RNAs (including the 3′ trimming of 5.8 S rRNA and U4 small nuclear RNA precursors) in the nucleus and the 3′ → 5′ degradation of mRNAs in the cytoplasm (20Butler J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 90-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21van Hoof A. Staples R.R. Baker R.E. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8230-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Ski4p is one of 10 essential protein components of the core exosome particle, and a deletion of the entire SKI4 protein sequence is lethal. Cells that contain the ski4–1 allele, however, are viable because they have a point mutation in the RNA binding domain of the protein that inhibits the 3′ → 5′ degradation of cytoplasmic mRNAs while retaining the essential exosomal functions that are required for the degradation and processing of small nuclear RNAs (21van Hoof A. Staples R.R. Baker R.E. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8230-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We were surprised to find that in the ski4–1 cells the native OLE1 transcript is highly stable, yielding near identical decay patterns under both basal and regulated conditions with half-lives of ∼30–35 min (Fig. 6). By contrast, the OLE1 mRNA expressed under the control of the GAL1 promoter has a basal half-life of about 6.5 min, but it also showed the loss of fatty acid-regulated decay (Fig. 6). These results show that the fatty acid-regulated instability of the OLE1 transcript requires exosomal functions associated with its 3′ → 5′-mRNA decay activity. Furthermore, the striking differences between the half-lives of the transcripts produced by the native promoter and those produced by the GAL1 promoter in the ski4–1 cells suggest that there may be other mechanistic linkages involving exosome activity that contribute to OLE1 mRNA stability that are also sensitive to different modes of transcription activation. This study presents the unexpected finding that the fatty acid-mediated regulation of OLE1 mRNA stability is controlled through the transcription activating factor, Mga2p. Although Mga2p and its homologue, Spt23p, lack DNA binding motifs, several lines of evidence show that they are directly involved in the activation of OLE1 transcription. For example, the expression of soluble, N-terminal fragments of either protein repair the unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophy of spt23Δ;mga2Δ cells and activate lacZ reporter genes that are under the control of the OLE1 promoter (7Chellappa R. Kandasamy P. Oh C.S. Jiang Y. Vemula M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43548-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, epitope-tagged forms of Mga2p specifically associate with a complex that forms on the LORE transcription activation element of the OLE1 promoter (5Jiang Y. Vasconcelles M.J. Wretzel S. Light A. Martin C.E. Goldberg M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6161-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Given that Mga2p functions in the activation of OLE1 transcription, we were surprised to find that in SPT23;mga2Δ cells, which only express the Spt23p homologue, the rate of decay of the OLE1 transcript is increased by about 2-fold and that its fatty acid-regulated instability is abolished. By contrast, Spt23p does not appear to play a role in either stabilizing the transcript or in controlling its regulated instability. For example, MGA2;spt23Δ cells do not exhibit differences in the basal or regulated half-lives of the OLE1 transcript from those in wild type cells. In addition, the reduced OLE1 basal mRNA half-life and the loss of its regulated stability in SPT23;mga2Δ cells is unaffected by the additional disruption of SPT23 in spt23Δ; mga2Δ cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Spt23p has little, if any, effect on the basal or regulated stability of the OLE1 transcript. The abilities of Mga2p to contribute to the activation of OLE1 transcription and the regulation of its mRNA stability appear to be distinct and separable functions. In cells that express Mga2p, the half-lives of an OLE1 transcript expressed under the control of the unrelated GAL1 promoter are similar to those in wild type cells under basal and regulated conditions. In mga2Δ cells, however, the OLE1 transcript expressed under the GAL1 promoter shows an identical reduction in half-life and loss of regulated instability to that seen with the native OLE1 transcript. Given that Mga2p has no effect on the induction of GAL1 transcription by galactose or its rapid repression in response to glucose, these studies indicate that Mga2p exerts control over the stability of the OLE1 mRNA in the absence of its normal transcription activation functions. These results also show that the effects of Mga2p on OLE1 mRNA stability can be separated into two distinct functions: one that results in stabilizing the transcript and another that confers its regulated instability. In wild type cells grown on fatty acid-depleted medium, Mga2p is required to stabilize the transcript from a half-life of ∼5–6 min (the case in mga2Δ cells) to an average of 10.5 min. On exposure to unsaturated fatty acids, however, Mga2p is required to destabilize the transcript to a half-life of <2 min. Interestingly, soluble forms of Mga2p, which do not undergo proteolytic processing on the ER membrane, can only stabilize the transcript and cannot perform the destabilizing function. The inability of these soluble forms to confer fatty acid-mediated instability on OLE1 mRNA suggests that modifications introduced on the membrane-bound wild type Mga2p during its ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic processing are an essential part of the regulation mechanism. Although it is tempting to speculate that Mga2p controls the stability of the OLE1 transcript through some type of direct mRNA binding mechanism, experiments in which we attempted to immunoprecipitate the OLE1 mRNA using N-terminal myc- and FLAG-tagged forms of Mga2p were unsuccessful under a wide range of conditions. This may be because Mga2p only binds transiently to the OLE1 ribonucleoprotein complex at some stage in its expression (e.g. transcription, messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) assembly, mRNA export, or during its translation) or because Mga2p acts indirectly through some intermediate protein or proteins to control OLE1 mRNA stability. An analysis of half-lives of the native and GAL1 induced transcripts in ski4–1 mutant cells indicates that the primary mechanism by which OLE1 mRNA stability is regulated by unsaturated fatty acids involves an activation of the degradation of the mRNA by the exosome complex. Exosomes are highly conserved multimeric particles that function both in the degradation of nuclear small RNAs and cytoplasmic mRNAs in yeast and higher eukaryotes (22van Hoof A. Lennertz P.

Takahashi S. Kobayashi T. Kajiho H. Hoshino S. Katada T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4684-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). An analysis of cells containing the exosomal ski4–1 allele, which retains its essential nuclear RNA degradation functions but has reduced mRNA degradation activity, blocks the OLE1 fatty acid-regulated instability response in both the native and GAL1-driven mRNA decay systems. We were surprised to find that this mutation also confers a much higher level of stability on the native transcript than in wild type cells. By contrast, the same mutation reduces the half-lives of the GAL1 driven transcript to 6.5 min. It is not clear why this mutation in the RNA binding domain of the exosome should produce such a dramatic difference in the basal half-life of the OLE1 transcript expressed by the two different promoter systems. An emerging picture of exosomal function, however, indicates that in addition to its role in the cytoplasmic degradation of mRNAs, it has nuclear functions that are closely tied with transcription, mRNP assembly, and mRNA export. Recent studies, for example, have linked the nuclear exosome to the mRNA export machinery that assembles on the nascent mRNA during the early stages of transcription suggesting that it may act as a surveillance mechanism for mRNPs that are competent for nuclear export (28Reed R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 29Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Wyss J.C. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) by degrading improperly assembled nascent mRNPs. It is conceivable that the mutation in the ski4–1p RNA binding domain may elicit different responses of this exosomal surveillance function with respect to these two different promoter systems. This further suggests that the wild type exosome may play some role in establishing the intrinsic stability of OLE1 mRNA during transcription and mRNP assembly in addition to performing its role in the fatty acid-regulated degradation of the transcript.

Previous studies have reported that the plasma protein, histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), interacts with plasminogen and cell surfaces, raising the possibility that HRG may immobilize plasminogen/plasmin to cell surfaces. Here we show, based on optical biosensor analyses, that immobilized HRG interacts with soluble plasminogen with high affinity and with an extremely slow dissociation rate. Furthermore, the HRG-plasminogen interaction is lysine-dissociable and involves predominately the amino-terminal domain of HRG, and the fifth kringle domain of plasminogen, but not the carboxyl-terminal lysine of HRG. HRG was also shown to tether plasminogen to cell surfaces, with this interaction being potentiated by elevated Zn2+ levels and low pH, conditions that prevail at sites of tissue injury, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. Based on these data we propose that HRG acts as a soluble adaptor molecule that binds to cells at sites of tissue injury, tumor growth, and angiogenesis, providing a high affinity receptor for tethering plasminogen to the cell surface and thereby enhancing the migratory potential of cells.

Plasminogen is a plasma protein, which, when converted to plasmin, is known to play a pivotal role in fibrinolysis (1Lijnen H.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Plasminogen is a 92-kDa modular glycoprotein consisting of a preactivation peptide, five kringle domains, and a catalytic carboxyl-terminal serine proteinase domain (3Parry M.A. Zhang X.C. Bode I.

Earlier studies also indicate that the plasminogen system aids directional cell migration associated with embryogenesis, development, tissue remodeling (6Dano K. Andreasen P.A. Grondahl-Hansen J.

This role in cell migration depends on the capacity of plasmin either to degrade a number of extracellular matrix proteins directly or to activate other proteases with matrix-degrading capabilities (10Chapman H.A.

Efficient cell migration and/or invasion usually requires that degradative enzymes be expressed on the surface of cells rather than being secreted into the extracellular environment. However, few high affinity plasminogen receptors have been identified on cells, which raises the question of how plasminogen is tethered onto the cell surface. A number of low affinity (Kd ∼ 1 μm) receptors for plasminogen have been defined, such as α-enolase (15Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9337-9343Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and annexin-II (17Brownstein C. Falcone D.J. Jacovina A. Hajjar K.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, results arising from in vivo studies in annexin-II-deficient mice demonstrated that annexin-II is an important regulator of cell surface plasmin generation, particularly in the absence of fibrin (18Ling Q. Jacovina A.T. Deora A. Febbraio M. Simantov R. Silverstein R.L. Hempstead B. Mark W.H. Hajjar K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been argued that because plasminogen is present in plasma at ∼2 μm, it could theoretically associate with cells via these low affinity receptors. It is known, however, that plasmin is inactivated rapidly unless it remains bound to cells (1Lijnen H.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and thus a low affinity interaction with high rates of dissociation would result in plasminogen being inactivated rapidly. This would suggest that high affinity plasminogen receptors are essential if plasmin is to aid cell migration effectively.

It is a multidomain molecule consisting of two cystatin-like domains at the amino terminus (termed N1 and N2), a central histidinerich region (HRR) flanked by two proline-rich sequences, and a carboxyl-terminal domain. Interestingly, HRG is reported to bind a variety of ligands, including plasminogen (20Lijnen H.R. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol.

Significantly, HRG is known to interact with both plasminogen and cell surfaces, raising the possibility that HRG may immobilize plasminogen/plasmin to the cell surface. In the present study we examined the interaction between HRG and plasminogen using both optical biosensor and cell surface binding assays. Our findings provide the first evidence that HRG can tether plasminogen to the surface of cells, specifically at low pH and in the presence of 20 μm Zn2+, conditions that usually occur at sites of tissue injury, inflammation, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. Based on these findings we propose that under conditions of low pH and elevated free Zn2+, HRG binds to cell surfaces and acts as a high affinity receptor for plasminogen. This would, in theory, enhance the efficiency of conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, protect plasmin from inactivation, and provides a mechanism for polarizing the proteolytic activity of plasmin on the cell surface, resulting in enhanced migratory potential. Cell Lines—B16F1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The Spodoptera frugiperda-derived insect cell line Sf9 was cultured in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. Purification of Human HRG, Plasminogen, and Angiostatin—Native human HRG was purified from fresh human plasma as described previously (36Rylatt D.B. Sia D.Y. Mundy J.P. Parish C.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, a phosphocellulose column was prepared and equilibrated with loading buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1mm EDTA, pH 6.8) for 24 h. Fresh human plasma was provided by Red Cross House, The Canberra Hospital, Canberra, Australia, and mixed with the protease inhibitors aprotinin (2 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml) and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzensulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (100 μg/ml). The plasma was passed through the equilibrated column, unbound protein was removed by extensive washing with loading buffer, and bound HRG was eluted with 2.0 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8. Native human plasminogen was purified from fresh human plasma, as described previously (37Rickli E.E. Otavsky W.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 59: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38Wiman B. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 39Moroi M. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5956-5965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by passage of plasma through a lysine-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and was washed extensively with 0.3 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, before elution of bound plasminogen with 0.1 m ϵ-aminocaproic acid, pH 7.4. Purified proteins were stored at –70 °C. Angiostatin was purified as described previously (40Stathakis P. Lay A.J. Fitzgerald M. Schlieker C. Matthias L.J. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8910-8916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs—Using the pUC9-HRG plasmid construct as a template (19Koide T. Foster D. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2220-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), PCR with oligonucleotides ALJ-1 and ALJ-5 was used to amplify a cDNA encoding the full-length human HRG comprised of the leader, first cystatin (N1) domain, second cystatin (N2) domain, the HRR, and carboxyl-terminal domain coding regions. A mutant form of HRG (C-mutant HRG) cDNA consisting of the full-length HRG coding region lacking the carboxyl-terminal lysine codon was generated by amplification with oligonucleotides ALJ-1 and ALJ-4. The N1 coding region was generated by amplification with oligonucleotides ALJ-1 and ALJ-2, and a cDNA encoding the first two cystatin domains (N1N2) was generated by amplification with oligonucleotides ALJ-1 and ALJ-3. Both the N1 and N1N2 cDNAs were engineered to encode a His6 tag at their 3′-end through inclusion of 6 tandem histidine codons in oligonucleotides ALJ-2 and ALJ-3. The oligonucleotide primer sequences used were as follows: ALJ-1, 5′-TTGAATTCTAAAGGGATGGTTTAACAAAATG-3′; ALJ-2, 5′-AAGGTACCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAGAACTTGTGGTGCAGTTATTAAAG-3′; ALJ-3, 5′-AAGGTACCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGAATGCTGAGGGTCGAAGACTTCAC-3′; ALJ-4, 5′-AAGGTACCTTATGGAAATGTATGTGTAAAAAACATG-3′; ALJ-5, 5′-AAGGTACCTTATTTTGGAAATGTATGTGTAAAAAAC-3′. The amplified HRG and HRG fragment cDNAs were cloned into the EcoRI/KpnI sites in the donor vector construct pFastBac (Invitrogen), generating pFastBac-HRG, pFastBac-C-mutHRG, pFastBac-N1, and pFastBac-N1N2 expression constructs, respectively. The nucleotide integrity of each clone was confirmed by automated sequencing using a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Transfections and Recombinant Protein Production Using the Baculovirus Expression System—Recombinant proteins of full-length HRG, C-mutant HRG, the N1 fragment, and the N1N2 domain of human HRG were produced using the “Bac-to-Bac” baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Recombinant bacmid constructs were generated using the pFastBac-HRG, pFastBac-C-mutHRG, pFastBac-N1, or pFastBac-N1N2 constructs according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Sf9 cells were transfected using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen), with 1–2 μg of recombinant bacmid DNA being transfected/9 × 105 cells for 5 h at 27 °C. Supernatant containing recombinant baculovirus was harvested 72 h post-transfection and was amplified for 3–4 days by infecting Sf9 cells with a multiplicity of infection of ∼0.01–0.1. Typically, recombinant baculovirus was amplified three times before being used to produce recombinant protein. Recombinant protein was purified from harvested Sf9 cell supernatants by passage of the supernatants through a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). Recombinant full-length HRG, C-mutant HRG, and recombinant H6-tagged N1 and N1N2 were then eluted from the Ni-NTA-agarose with 200 mm imidazole. Proteins were stored at –70 °C until use. Western Blotting—Recombinant proteins were boiled for 10 min in 20 μl of SDS reducing sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 10% dithiothreitol, 4% SDS) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis on a 4–20% gradient (w/v) precast polyacrylamide MiniGel (Gradipore, Sydney, Australia). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically using a Mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad) onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a transfer buffer containing 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine in 20% (v/v) methanol. The membrane was blocked overnight with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder in PBS. Full-length HRG, C-mutant HRG, and the N1N2 domain were detected using a HRG-specific (HRG-4; AGEN, Brisbane, Australia) mAb, and N1 and N1N2 were detected using a His6-specific (Roche Diagnostics) mAb (His6). Chemiluminescence was detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Enzyme-linked Immunoadsorbent Assays (ELISAs)—ELISAs were performed by coating 96-well PVC microtiter plastic plates (Dynax Technologies Inc., Chantilly, VA) overnight at 4 °C with plasminogen or recombinant full-length HRG, C-mutant HRG, N1 fragment, or N1N2 domain (50 μl/well, ∼5 μg/ml) diluted in a 0.05 m Na2CO3/NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.6 (Sigma). Plates were then washed in PBS and 0.01% Tween 20 (Sigma) and blocked for 120 min at room temperature with 3% (w/v) BSA diluted in PBS. For the plasminogen-pretreated plates, recombinant forms of HRG diluted in PBS and 1% BSA (50 μl/well, ∼5 μg/ml) were added to the plates, allowed to bind for 60 min at room temperature, and then washed in PBS and 0.01% Tween 20. HRG and HRG fragment binding to empty blocked plates was used as the negative background control. Bound full-length HRG, C-mutant HRG, and the N1N2 domain were detected using HRG-4, whereas bound N1 fragment was detected using His6, followed by secondary antibody detection with a sheep anti-mouse Ig horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amrad Biotech, Melbourne, Australia). Plate-bound peroxidase was detected using ABTS peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Inc. Gaithersburg, MD) by measuring absorbance at 405 nm (reference wavelength 490 nm) on a Thermomax microplate reader. The data were analyzed using SoftMaxPro software (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Immunofluorescence Flow Cytometry—Cell lines were analyzed for HRG or plasminogen/angiostatin cell surface binding by flow cytometry. Typically, 100 μg/ml plasma-derived or recombinant HRG and/or 150 μg/ml plasma-derived plasminogen/angiostatin was added to 5 × 105 cells in PBS and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.2, ± 20 μm Zn2+ for 60 min at 4 °C and washed three times with PBS and 0.1% BSA. Zinc acetate was used as a source of Zn2+, and Zn2+ was added after BSA to PBS to prevent precipitation. Cell-bound HRG was detected using the HRG-4 mAb followed by secondary detection with sheep anti-mouse Ig fluorescein isothiocyanate (Amrad Biotech), and cell-bound plasminogen or angiostatin was detected using a rabbit polyclonal plasminogen Ab (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) followed by secondary detection with sheep anti-rabbit Ig fluorescein isothiocyanate (Amrad Biotech). Samples incubated with the relevant primary and secondary detection antibodies and/or conjugates in the absence of HRG or plasminogen/angiostatin served as a background binding control. Cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence flow cytometry using a LSR Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the resultant data were analyzed using Cell Quest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Each condition was typically performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated two or three times. In some experiments, cells were incubated with HRG in PBS and 0.1% BSA with different Zn2+ concentrations in the range 0–100 μm, and/or pH in the range pH 6.0–8.0. Surface Plasmon Resonance—A BIAcore 2000 (Pharmacia Biosensor) instrument was used to measure binding by surface plasmon resonance. CM5 sensor chips and coupling reagents were purchased from Pharmacia Biosensor. The carboxyl methylated dextran surfaces of flow-cells on the CM5 chip were activated by injecting 35 μl of 0.05 m EDC and 0.05 mN-hydroxysuccinimde diluted in double distilled Milli-Q water at 5 μl/min. Plasma-derived and recombinant HRG each were immobilized onto the N-hydroxysuccinimde ester-activated surface by injecting ∼10 μl of HRG (100 μg/ml) diluted in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, at 5 μl/min. Remaining N-hydroxysuccinimde esters were deactivated by injecting 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, at 5 μl/min. Typically, a flow rate of 10 μl/min was used throughout the binding assays. Different concentrations of plasminogen/angiostatin (0–2,000 nm, 30–100 μl) were injected into the flow-cells of the biosensor, with binding and dissociation each monitored for 3–10 min. Plasminogen-HRG complexes were effectively disrupted by injecting 100 mm l-lysine for 1 min at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. Experiments used an automated program to control triplicate injections of each binding protein. Flow-cell 1 was used as a blank reference cell, with the background binding to the dextran matrix detected in flow-cell 1 being subtracted from responses in flow-cells 2, 3, and 4. Binding curves were analyzed using the BIA Evaluation program (Pharmacia Biosensor). Effect of Zn2+and pH on the Binding of Human HRG to Cell Surfaces—Previous studies have shown that the binding of HRG to surface-immobilized heparin is dependent on both Zn2+ and pH, with Borza and Morgan (41Borza D.B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5493-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) suggesting that Zn2+ and pH act synergistically to affect the conformation and thus function of HRG. This observation prompted us to test the effect of Zn2+ and pH on HRG binding to cell surfaces. We used the metastatic mouse melanoma cell line, B16F1, in the cell surface binding studies. Dose-response experiments indicated that the potentiating effect of Zn2+ on HRG binding to B16F1 cells plateaued between 5 and 50 μm but was near maximal at ∼20 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 1, A and B), with HRG binding being enhanced ∼6-fold. Such concentrations of Zn2+ can occur physiologically (42Brown K.H. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 68: 425S-429SCrossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, at high Zn2+ concentrations (100 μm), HRG binding was decreased to less than that observed in the absence of any added Zn2+ (Fig. 1B). A similar effect of Zn2+ concentration on HRG binding was observed with CHO-KI cells (data not shown). We also investigated the effect of pH on HRG binding to cell surfaces in the presence of an optimal Zn2+ concentration (20 μm) and found that binding was minimal at pH 8.0 but increased steadily as the pH was reduced to 6.0 (Fig. 1, C and D). In fact, there was a ∼250-fold increase in the level of cell surface-bound HRG across this pH range. Thus, it appears that both Zn2+ and pH directly affect the interaction of HRG with cell surfaces, with optimal HRG binding occurring in the presence of ∼20 μm Zn2+ and at pH 6.0. Soluble Plasminogen Binds to Immobilized HRG—Previous studies identified plasminogen as an important HRG ligand (20Lijnen H.R. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10214-10222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ichinose A. Mimuro J. Koide T. Aoki N. Thromb. Res. 1984; 33: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Using the optical biosensor, we further characterized this interaction by monitoring the binding and dissociation of soluble plasminogen to immobilized HRG (Fig. 2A). These binding studies showed that the interaction of soluble plasminogen with immobilized HRG is dependent on the plasminogen concentration over the range tested of 32–2,000 nm (3–185 μg/ml). The almost flat dissociation curve (Fig. 2A) indicates an extremely slow off-rate or dissociation between HRG and plasminogen, reflecting a high affinity interaction (see analysis below). In fact, even when dissociation was allowed to occur for many hours, plasminogen remained tightly bound to HRG (data not shown). Nevertheless, bound plasminogen could be very effectively displaced by exposure to 100 mm l-lysine, indicating that lysine can disrupt HRG-plasminogen complexes, and hence the interaction is likely to be mediated by lysine residues (Fig. 2B). Alternatively, lysine may disrupt the plasminogen-HRG complex by binding to plasminogen and inducing a conformation change that results in the complex dissociating. Similar association-dissociation results were obtained with plasminogen-I and plasminogen-II (data not shown), isoforms of the molecule that differ by one glycosylation site (43Hayes M.L. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8777-8780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Hayes M.L. Castellino J.F. J. Biol.

An analysis of the binding curves for the interaction between soluble plasminogen and immobilized HRG using the Bia-Evaluation program showed that the data could be described by both a bivalent analyte model and a two-state conformation model. The bivalent analyte model assumes that each molecule of the analyte (plasminogen) can interact bivalently with one or two immobilized ligand (HRG) molecule(s). Binding to the first HRG molecule is defined by a single set of rate constants (ka1 and kd1), and binding to the second HRG molecule is defined by a second set of rate constants (ka2 and kd2), thus allowing the model to take cooperative effects into account (Table I). Such cooperative effects could well explain the extremely slow offrates that are observed (Fig. 2). The two-state conformation model, on the other hand, assumes that one molecule of plasminogen binds to one or more molecules of immobilized HRG, and that this is then followed by a conformation change (represented as * in the reactions below) in the complex, which stabilizes the interaction. Again, two sets of kinetic constants are produced (Table I), involving two-step association and dissociation, shown below.A+B→AB(Step 1)REACTION 1AB→AB*(Step 2)REACTION 2AB*→AB(Step 1)REACTION 3AB→A+B(Step 2)REACTION 4Both the bivalent analyte and two-state conformation models estimate an apparent Kd value for the interaction of ∼200–300 nm, with the most notable feature of the interaction between immobilized HRG and soluble plasminogen being the extremely slow dissociation/off-rate, indicating a high affinity, highly stable interaction.Table IAssociation rate (ka) and dissociation rate constants (kd) for the bivalent analyte model and the two-state conformation model for describing the interaction of soluble plasminogen with immobilized HRGModelka1kd1ka2aRU, response units.kd2Bivalent4.6 × 104 ± 1.42 × 103 ms-10.19 ± 0.018 s-11.8 × 10-5 ± 1.8 × 10-6 RU-11.2 × 10-3 ± 6.3 × 10-5 s-1Two-state3.1 × 105 ± 1.8 × 105 ms-10.19 ± 0.057 s-15.2 × 10-3 ± 2.9 × 10-4 s-12.5 × 10-3 ± 1.3 × 10-4 s-1a RU, response units. Open table in a new tab Plasminogen Binding to the Surface of B16F1 Cells Is Enhanced Dramatically in the Presence of HRG—Although plasminogen has been reported to interact with HRG, there has been no previous indication that HRG can potentiate the interaction of plasminogen with the cell surface. Using flow cytometry, we found that 150 μg/ml plasminogen binding to the surface of B16F1 cells is enhanced greatly (up to 14-fold) when the cells have been either precoated with 100 μg/ml plasma-derived HRG (Fig. 3A, HRG/plasminogen) or when plasminogen is coincubated with HRG (Fig. 3A, HRG+plasminogen). The effect of HRG on plasminogen binding to B16F1 cells was maximal when the cells were coincubated with a mixture of plasminogen and HRG, rather than precoating the cells with HRG prior to plasminogen exposure (p < 0.01, Fig. 3B). HRG also enhanced the binding of plasminogen to cells over a wide range of plasminogen concentrations (0.1–200 μg/ml) (data not shown), although these studies showed that in the presence of physiological concentrations of HRG (100 μg/ml, 1.3 μm), maximal plasminogen binding occurred with 150 μg/ml (∼1.6 μm) plasminogen, which is the physiological plasma concentration of this molecule. Further studies aimed at characterizing the effect of soluble HRG on plasminogen cell surface binding showed that excess soluble HRG (>5 times molar excess of HRG over plasminogen) (1.6 μm plasminogen, 8 μm HRG) did not inhibit cell surface plasminogen binding (Fig. 3C). Even relatively low concentrations of HRG (0.3 μm) were sufficient to support near maximum plasminogen binding, suggesting that HRG is an efficient adaptor molecule for binding plasminogen to the cell surface. Our initial studies indicated that pH affects HRG cell surface binding (Fig. 1, C and D). Using flow cytomet"
https://openalex.org/W2055078479,"A multifunctional enzyme, Gh, is a GTP-binding protein that couples to the α1B-adrenoreceptor and stimulates phospholipase C-δ1 but also displays transglutaminase 2 (TG2) activity. Gh/TG2 has been implicated to play a role in cell motility. In this study we have examined which function of Gh/TG2 is involved in this cellular response and the molecular basis. Treatment of human aortic smooth muscle cell with epinephrine inhibits migration to fibronectin and vitronectin, and the inhibition is blocked by the α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin or chloroethylclonidine. Up-regulation or overexpression of Gh/TG2 in human aortic smooth muscle cells, DDT1-MF2, or human embryonic kidney cells, HEK 293 cells, results in inhibition of the migratory activity, and stimulation of the α1B-adrenoreceptor with the α1 agonist further augments the inhibition of migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells and DDT1-MF2. Gh/TG2 is coimmunoprecipitated by an integrin α5 antibody and binds to the cytoplasmic tail peptide of integrins α5, αv, and αIIb subunits in the presence of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS). Mutation of Lys-Arg residues in the GFFKR motif, present in the α5-tail, significantly reduces the binding of GTPγS-Gh/TG2. Moreover, the motif-containing integrin α5-tail peptides block Gh/TG2 coimmunoprecipitation and reverse the inhibition of the migratory activity of HEK 293 cells caused by overexpression Gh/TG2. These results provide evidence that Gh function initiates the modulation of cell motility via association of GTP-bound Gh/TG2 with the GFFKR motif located in integrin α subunits.

Gh/TG2 is coimmunoprecipitated by an integrin α5 antibody and binds to the cytoplasmic tail peptide of integrins α5, αv, and αIIb subunits in the presence of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS). Mutation of Lys-Arg residues in the GFFKR motif, present in the α5-tail, significantly reduces the binding of GTPγS-Gh/TG2. Moreover, the motif-containing integrin α5-tail peptides block Gh/TG2 coimmunoprecipitation and reverse the inhibition of the migratory activity of HEK 293 cells caused by overexpression Gh/TG2. These results provide evidence that Gh function initiates the modulation of cell motility via association of GTP-bound Gh/TG2 with the GFFKR motif located in integrin α subunits.

A study reports that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 by α1AR-Gh/TG2 coupling is inhibited by overexpression of calreticulin (CRT) in neonatal cardiomyocytes (26Lee J.-H.

This calcium-binding protein, CRT, is shown to inhibit both GTP binding and TGase activities of Gh/TG2 (27Feng J.-F. Readon M. Yadav S.P. Im M.-J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10743-10749Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A very recent in vivo study with transgenic mice, which have overexpressed Gh/TG2 in heart, has provided compelling evidence for the Gh/TG2-mediated signaling (19Zhang Z. Vezza R. Plappert T.

This study has demonstrated that Gh/TG2 overexpression results in cardiac hypertrophy, expression of several genes, and apoptosis due to enhanced thromboxane A2 receptor signaling that leads to extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. A major obstacle in Gh/TG2 signaling is defining of GTPase-versus TGase-mediated responses, because the coupling of Gh/TG2 to the receptors increases [Ca2+]i, that may lead to activation of TGase. Overexpression of wild-type Gh/TG2 or TGase activity-ablated Gh/TG2 in vivo and in vitro is shown to affect cell spreading, migration, and contractility of heart (13Akimov S.S. Belkin A.M.

In this study we have attempted to clarify the primary and initiating Gh/TG2 function (G-protein versus TGase function) on cell motility by means of determining cell migratory activity. Our results revealed that the coupling of Gh/TG2 to the α1BAR and/or up-regulation of Gh/TG2 expression inhibit cell migration in an integrin- and Gh-dependent manner. The results also indicate that modulation of the cell migratory activity is mediated by the binding of Gh to the GFFKR motif present in the cytoplasmic tail of various integrin α subunits. Cell Culture—Primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were provided by Dr. P. Dicorletto at The Lerner Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Cleveland, OH); 6–10 passages were used for the study. Hamster leiomyosarcoma (DDT1-MF2) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293 cells) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. HASMC and HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-F-12 supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mg/ml glutamine. DDT1-MF2 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and the antibiotics indicated above. The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2, 95% air. Plasmids and Transfection—Wild-type Gh/TG2 (wtTG) was cloned from a human heart cDNA library (30Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sivasubramaniam N. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and a TGase active site mutant C277S tTG (C-STG) was obtained by substituting cysteine to serine (31Lee K.N.

An α1BAR interaction site mutant Gh/TG2 (m3TG) was prepared as previously described (15Feng J.-F. Gray C.D. Im M.-J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2224-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A deletion mutant (ΔN20TG) of Gh/TG2 in which 20 amino acids were deleted from the N terminus was obtained by PCR using human heart Ghα DNA and two primers: a sense primer, 5′-CCACCATGCACACGGCCGACCTGTGCCG-3′, and an antisense primer, 5′-TGGGACCAGGGGCACATTCCATTTC. A correct PCR product was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. All Gh/TG2 clones were inserted into pcDNA3.0-neo. Plasmids of wtTG, its mutants, and vector were transfected to DDT1-MF2 and HEK 293 cells using LipofectAMINE as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected using 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and maintained in the respective growth media containing 300 μg/ml G418. Determination of Cell Migratory Activity—Cells were detached with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)-buffered saline solution containing 1 mm EDTA and washed three times with DMEM or DMEM-F-12 containing βAR blocker propranolol (1 μm) and α2AR blocker rauwalscine (100 nm). Cell migratory activity was determined in the presence and absence of 5 μm (–)epinephrine using Transwell (Costar, Corning, NY) with 8-μm-poresize membranes. The bottom of the membranes was coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Fn) or vitronectin (Vn) (Roche Applied Science) or poly-l-lysine (Sigma), and cells (5 × 105 in 150 μl) were added to the top chamber. In some cases both sides of membranes were coated with 10 μg/ml Fn. After incubation for 8 h, cells in the top chamber were removed using cotton swaps and frozen at –80 °C for 1 h or more. Cells migrated to the bottom membranes were quantified by determining DNA content using a CyQUANT kit as provided by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Stress Fiber Staining—Cell spreading and formation of stress fibers in HASMC were performed with and without 5 μm (–)epinephrine in the presence of propranolol (1 μm) and rauwalscine (100 nm). Cells were plated on Fn (10 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips and incubated in a cell culture incubator. At indicated time points, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and blocked with 4% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) for 1 h and washed with PBS. Formation of stress fibers was examined using a Leica confocal microscope. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion assay used was a slight modification of the method described previously (14Balklava Z. Verderio E. Collighan R. Gross S. Adams J. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16567-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell suspension (1 × 105 cells/well) was seeded in a 48-well plate coated with 5–20 μg/ml Fn, incubated in serum free media, allowed to attach for 30 min or 1 h. The floating cells were gently removed with PBS, and numbers of attached cells were determined by measuring DNA content using Cy-QUANT kit. For the experiments with HASMC and DDT1-MF2, cells were incubated with and without 5 μm (–)epinephrine. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For the immunoprecipitation, HEK 293 cells expressed wtTG, C-STG, or ΔN20TG were extracted using 1% Triton X-100 in a lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) by 3 rounds of freezing in a dry ice bath and thawing at 30 °C. The extracts (500 μgof protein) obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with and without 5 μm GTPγS or 200 μm GDP or GTPγS plus a 120-kDa soluble Fn fragment (Invitrogen) or poly-RGD peptide or RGE peptide (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min. A polyclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of integrin α5 subunit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl of 1:1 suspension, Sigma) was added, and the mixtures were incubated with gentle shaking at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm and washed 3 times (1 ml/wash) with a washing buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.2% sucrose monolaurate). Immunoprecipitation of Gh/TG2 and/or integrin α5 was determined by immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-Gh/TG2 antibody (CUB7402 from Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) or the polyclonal integrin α5 antibody as described previously (15Feng J.-F. Gray C.D. Im M.-J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2224-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After incubating the blots with the respective secondary antibodies, the immunoreactive proteins were determined using a Super Signal chemiluminescent kit (Pierce) and exposing to BIOMAX films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Determination of Gh/TG2 Binding to Peptide-Sepharose—Equimolar amounts of cytoplasmic tails of the integrin α and β1 subunits or Fn were incubated with CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B using the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The peptides were synthesized in the Biotechnology Core Facility at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Cleveland, OH). The purity of the peptides was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy analyses. The peptide beads (40 μl of a 1:1 suspension) pretreated with 1% bovine serum albumin were incubated with the cytosol fraction prepared from HEK 293 cell-expressed wtTG under the various conditions at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads obtained by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min were washed 3 times with 1 ml of the washing buffer. Gh/TG2 bound to the peptides was determined by immunoblotting as described above. For the preparation of cytosol fraction, cells were washed with HEPES (pH 7.4)-buffered saline solution and lysed with the lysis buffer. The cytosol fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. In some cases, purified Gh/TG2 and CRT from rat liver were used as specified in the legends to Figs. 4C and 6B. Gh/TG2 and CRT were purified as described previously (27Feng J.-F. Readon M. Yadav S.P. Im M.-J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10743-10749Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Fig. 6Gh/TG2 interacts with integrin α subunits via GFFKR motif. A, amino acid alignments of cytoplasmic tails of various integrin α subunits including α5. B, CRT blocks Gh/TG2 binding to α5-, αv -, and αIIb-tail peptides. Peptide affinity gels of α5, αv, and αIIb were incubated CRT (4 μg) at the in presence or absence of 4 °C for 2 h and then further incubated with purified Gh/TG2 (1.5 μg) in the presence of 5 μm GTPγS and 5 mm MgCl2 for 2 h. Gh/TG2 binding was determined by immunoblotting with TG2 antibody. C and D, mutation of Lys-Arg (KR) residues in the GFFKR motif reduces Gh/TG2 binding. Lys (K), Arg (R), or Lys-Arg residues in the GFFKR motif in α5A was mutated to I (K-Iα5A) or T (R-Tα5A), or IT (KR-ITα5A), respectively. Peptide gels were incubated with cytosol prepared from HEK 293 cells expressed wtTG under the same conditions described above. The gels were washed and subjected to immunoblotting with TG2 antibody. Binding of Gh/TG2 to α5 was taken as 100%. The data presented are the means ± S.E. from three independent experiments. *, α5versus α5A or various mutated α5A, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Assays—Density of α1ARs was determined using 20 nm [3H]prazosin by a fast filter method, and TGase activity was measured using 1 μCi of [3H]putrescine and 1% N,N′-dimethyl casein as described previously (32Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sweet W.E. Moravec C.S. Im M.-J. Circulation. 1996; 94: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Determination of GTP binding to Gh/TG2 was evaluated using 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP by photoaffinity labeling (33Im M.-J. Riek P.R. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18952-18960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α1 agonist-mediated GTP binding to Gh/TG2 was determined using a method described previously (34Im M.-J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18944-18951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (100 μg) prepared from HASMC treated with 5 μm for 24 h were preincubated in the presence of 5 μm (–)epinephrine or epinephrine plus phentolamine (0.1 mm) at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were transferred to an ice bath, and [α-32P]GTP (20 μCi/tube) was added. After incubation for 5 min, the samples were subjected to UV irradiation at 254 nm for 8 min. The [α-32P]GTP binding was visualized by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE (8% gel). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and known concentrations of bovine serum albumin were used as the standard. Data Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance. The difference was considered significant at p < 0.05. Stimulation of α1ARs with Epinephrine Inhibits Migratory Activity of HASMC in Collaboration with Integrins—We first examined whether stimulation of the α1AR displays any effects on the migratory activity, spreading, and adhesion of HASMC using integrin ligands Fn and Vn. Poly-l-lysine was used to examine an involvement of integrins in these cellular responses. As presented in Fig. 1, treatment of HASMC with epinephrine inhibited the migratory activity of HASMC to Fn and Vn (Fig. 1A). The α1 agonist-mediated inhibition was blocked by treatment of the α1-antagonists prazosin and chloroethylclonidine (CEC). Cell migration to poly-l-lysine was small, and the α1 agonist-dependent inhibition was not observed, indicating that the α1 agonist-mediated inhibition of cell migration is integrin-dependent. Moreover, the inhibition of cell migration was significantly enhanced as a function of α1 agonist concentrations (Fig. 1B). In contrast, spreading of HASMC and formation of stress fibers were greatly stimulated in the presence of α1 agonist in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C) and were visibly blocked by CEC (Fig. 1D). The order of cell size increased was epinephrine ≫ CEC > control (–epinephrine) after a 12-h incubation. Determination of cell adhesion to Fn revealed that although numbers of attached cells were increased as a function of Fn concentration and incubation time, no significant differences in cell adhesion with and without the α1 agonist were found (data not shown). These data indicate that stimulation of CEC-sensitive α1AR in HASMC modulates cell migratory activity and facilitates cytoskeletal reorganization but not cell adhesion and that integrin ligation is indispensable for these α1AR-mediated cellular responses. α1BAR-Gh/TG2 Coupling and Up-regulation of Gh/TG2 Expression Modulate Cell Motility—The above results indicate that the CEC-sensitive α1AR is involved in modulation of cell migration. This α1AR blocker covalently binds to the α1BAR with high affinity and the α1BAR couples with Gh/TG2 and Gq (1Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M.

To evaluate whether the CEC-sensitive α1AR-mediated inhibition of cell migration is caused by the coupling of the receptor with Gh/TG2, expression of Gh/TG2 in HASMC was induced by incubation of all-trans retinoic acid (RA), which is one of the well characterized Gh/TG2 inducers (5Chen J.S.

The cell migratory activity was reduced in a RA concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Moreover, further augmentation of the Gh/TG2-mediated inhibition was observed by treatment of the α1 agonist. To ascertain whether the α1BAR-Gh/TG2 coupling occurs, binding of GTP to Gh/TG2 and changes in [Ca2+]i in response to the α1AR activation were determined. As shown Fig. 2B, GTP binding of Gh/TG2 by incubation with the α1 agonist was significantly increased as compared with that in the absence of the α1 agonist, and the α1 agonist-mediated increase was blocked by an α1-antagonist, phentolamine. Moreover, the α1AR-stimulated GTP binding of Gh/TG2 was not observed with the membranes prepared from CEC-pretreated HASMC. [Ca2+]i was also increased as Gh/TG2 levels were increased (Fig. 2C). The observation that coupling of Gh/TG2 to the α1BAR and/or up-regulation of the Gh/TG2 expression inhibit cell migration was again evaluated using DDT1-MF2, which expresses the α1BAR subtype among α1ARs (37Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A. Randall R.R. Lefknowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Kobilika B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1993; 1202: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the mutant m3TG is unable to couple to the α1BAR effectively as compared with wtTG (15Feng J.-F. Gray C.D. Im M.-J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2224-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Approximately 4-fold overexpression of wtTG and C-STG resulted in significant inhibition of cell migratory activity as compared with the native and vector control cells (Figs. 3, A and B). Stimulation of the α1BAR with epinephrine further augmented the inhibition of the migratory activity of wtTG and C-STG cells, and the migratory activity of native and vector cells was also significantly reduced (Fig. 3B). Moreover, overexpression of m3TG did not reduce the cell migratory activity, probably due to the competition with endogenous Gh/TG2. As expected, activation of the α1BAR did not change the migration of m3TG-overexpressed cells. In addition, we also determined whether the inhibition of cell migration by the coupling of α1BAR with Gh/TG2 or overexpression of wtTG is due to blocking of chemotaxis or reduced chemokinesis. When cell migration was determined using Transwell membranes with both sides coated with Fn or random migration on Fn-coated glass slides, similar inhibitory effects on motility were observed whether the membranes were coated on one or both sides (data not show"

The deduced amino acid sequence encoded a protein with a molecular mass of 41,176 Da, which showed 28 and 31% sequence identity, respectively, to a gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas alcaligenes NCIMB 9867 and a 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate 1,2-dioxygenase from Nocardioides sp.

The oxygenolytic cleavage of the aromatic nucleus by bacteria requires in most cases the presence of two hydroxy groups attached to the aromatic ring (1Que Jr., L. Ho R.Y.N. Chem.

Only a few examples have been described previously in which monohydroxylated aromatic compounds were cleaved by ring fission dioxygenases, and in most of these examples aminohydroxybenzene derivatives were observed as ring fission substrates. The ability of “traditional” ring fission dioxygenases to oxidize aminohydroxybenzene derivatives is mechanistically easily explained, because the amino group activates the aromatic nucleus in a similar way as the hydroxy group for an electrophilic attack of the ring-cleaving dioxygenases (4Davis J.K.

There are also a few examples that describe the ring fission of monohydroxylated aromatic compounds that do not possess a second electron-donating substituent. This has been described for the oxidation of 5-chlorosalicylate by a “Bacillus” sp. and for the conversion of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate by several Gram-negative (e.g. Aeromonas sp.) and Gram-positive bacteria (Nocardioides sp.) From these two reactions only the oxidation of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate by Nocardioides sp. KP7 has been analyzed on an enzymatic and genetic level, and the ring fission product was isolated and characterized by various spectroscopic techniques (10Adachi K. Iwabuchi T. Sano H. Harayama S.

The ring fission dioxygenase resembled gentisate 1,2-dioxygenases or 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenases, because of the ability of the enzyme to convert gentisate and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, the size of the subunits, the structure of the holoenzyme, and the dependence of the enzyme on Fe2+ ions (15Hintner J.-P.

In order to allow a more detailed analysis of the ability of ring fission dioxygenases to oxidatively cleave the aromatic ring of monohydroxylated benzene derivatives in the current study, the encoding gene was cloned and the substrate specificity of the enzyme analyzed in greater detail.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains and Media—The isolation and characterization of P. salicylatoxidans strain BN12 DSM 6986T has been described previously (16Kämpfer P.

Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 was obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany. Escherichia coli JM109 and E. coli BL21(DE3) were used as host strains for recombinant DNA work.Mineral media were prepared as described by Dorn et al. (18Dorn E. Hellwig M. Reineke W. Knackmuss H.-J. Arch. Microbiol. 1974; 99: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and were supplemented with 100 mg/liter of yeast extract. P. salicylatoxidans was routinely grown in this supplemented mineral medium with 5 mm 6-aminonaphthalene-2-sulfonate. For the cultivation of C. glutamicum, a complex medium proposed by the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen was used. The recombinant E. coli strains were routinely cultured in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml).Heat-labile and autoxidable substrates were sterilized by membrane filtration (pore size, 0.2 μm; Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany); all other substrates were autoclaved at 121 °C.Oxygen Uptake Experiments—P. salicylatoxidans BN12 was grown in a mineral medium with 6-aminonaphthalene-2-sulfonate (5 mm) supplemented with 100 mg/liter yeast extract. The cells were harvested during the late exponential growth phase by centrifugation and resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 8) to an optical density (A546 nm) of 14. The resting cells were incubated at 30 °C in an oxygen electrode (YSI 5350, YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). The endogenous respiration was determined for 2 min, and then the respective salicylates were added (1 mm each). The oxygen uptake was recorded for 5 min, and the reaction rates were corrected for the endogenous respiration.Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cell suspensions in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) were disrupted by using a French press (Aminco, Silver Springs, MD) at 80 MPa. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein content of the cell extracts was determined by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard.Protein Purification, Enzymatic Cleavage of the Protein, Isolation of Peptides, and Sequencing of Peptides and Amino Termini—The dioxygenase was purified from P. salicylatoxidans BN12 by fast protein liquid chromatography as described previously (15Hintner J.-P. Lechner C. Riegert U. Kuhm A.E. Storm T. Reemtsma T. Stolz A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6936-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The digestion of the purified dioxygenase by trypsin and the subsequent separation of tryptic digests by reversed-phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; LC-MS, liquid chromatographymass spectrometry. were performed by established procedures (20Stone K.L. LoPresti M.B. Crawford J.M. DeAngelis R. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Micro sequencing. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 31-47Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation by using an ABI 476 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar), and the gels were routinely stained with Coomassie Blue.Enzyme Assays with Purified Enzyme Preparations—One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of substrate/min. The conversion of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, gentisate, 5-aminosalicylate, and salicylate were determined spectrophotometrically as described previously (15Hintner J.-P. Lechner C. Riegert U. Kuhm A.E. Storm T. Reemtsma T. Stolz A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6936-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The conversion of all other salicylates and benzoic acids was analyzed by HPLC. The reaction mixtures contained, in a total volume of 1 ml, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and the respective substrates (0.1 mm each). The reactions were started by the addition of the purified enzyme (0.04–0.1 mg of protein). After 10–30 s, 50 μl of the reaction mixtures were removed and the reactions terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 1 m HCl or by boiling for 10 min (for the experiments with 3,5-dichloro-, 3,5-dibromo-, and 3,5-diiodosalicylate). The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge (2 min at 14,000 rpm). The concentrations of the substrates were subsequently analyzed by HPLC.For the determination of the kinetic Vmax and Km values, the kinetic parameters were determined basically as described above but using a substrate concentration range from 0.01 to 5 mm.Analytical Methods—The turnover of the substituted salicylates was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (HPLC pumps model 510 equipped with a photo-diode array detector model 996 and Millenium Chromatography Manager 2.0, Waters, Milford, MA.). A reversed-phase column (125 × 4.0 mm, internal diameter), packed with 5-μm particles of Merck Lichrospher RP8 (end capped) was used. The separated compounds were detected photometrically at 210 nm and at the wavelength indicated in Table I by using a photodiode array detector.Table ISolvent systems, retention times, and detection wavelength used for HPLC analysisSolvent system (% methanol)Substrate(Main) productRtAbsorption maximumRtAbsorption maximum%minnmminnm3-Aminosalicylic acid103.0300NDaND, not detected.4-Aminosalicylic acid107.63001.72745-Aminosalicylic acid404.8317ND3-Hydroxysalicylic acid404.83172.33324-Hydroxysalicylic acid404.72951.62466-Hydroxysalicylic acid403.6308NRbNR, no reaction observed.3-Methylsalicylic acid606.33091.72104-Methylsalicylic acid605.13021.72105-Methylsalicylic acid605.13151.72055-Fluorosalicylic acid604.43131.62933-Chlorosalicylic acid605.33091.82174-Chlorosalicylic acid607.73021.72175-Chlorosalicylic acid606.93151.83003-Bromosalicylic acid606.13091.82234-Bromosalicylic acid608.93021.72225-Bromosalicylic acid608.03151.83005-Iodosalicylic acid609.4320NR5-Nitrosalicylic acid603.6308NR5-Sulfosalicylic acid104.1302NR3,5-Dichlorosalicylic acid6010.83191.62103,5-Dibromosalicylic acid6014.33191.72003,5-Diiodosalicylic acid6021.5328NRSalicylic acid1522.13003.3283a ND, not detected.b NR, no reaction observed. Open table in a new tab Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry—Product identification was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HP1100, Agilent) coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Quattro LC, Micromass, Manchester, UK) using electrospray ionization in the negative ion mode. Substrate solutions before and after addition of the enzyme and 20 min after addition of the enzyme were injected (20 μl) into the HPLC system without any pretreatment. Analytes were separated by ion-pair chromatography on a Luna C18 (2Bugg T.D.H. Lin G. Chem. Comm. 2001; : 941-952Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar) 3-μm column, 15 cm × 3 mm inner diameter at 40 °C. Eluent A was H2O/MeOH (80:20 v/v), and eluent B was H2O/MeOH (5:95 v/v) with 1 mm tributylamine and 1 mm acetic acid each. Gradient elution started with 20% (v/v) eluent B at 0 min, 90% eluent B at 11 min, isocratic to 15 min, and 16 min 20% (v/v) eluent B, 21 min, 20% (v/v) eluent B. A diode array detector and the MS were coupled in a series. The mass spectrometric interface was operated at a cone voltage of 18 V and a capillary voltage of 2.9 kV. Probe temperature was 220 °C, and source block temperature was 120 °C. Product ion spectra were recorded at collision energies of 10 and 15 eV with a scan rate of 0.5 s.PCR—Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized according to the known or deduced sequences of the amino-terminal amino acid sequence and various internal peptides of the ring fission dioxygenase. PCR mixtures (25–50 μl) for the amplification of genomic DNA contained 2 mm of each primer, 10–100 ng of genomic template DNA, 0.1 mm of each deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 units of Taq (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) or Pwo (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) DNA polymerase and the corresponding reaction buffers.For the amplification reaction with the primers deduced from the amino terminus and the peptide P28, the following PCR program was used: an initial denaturation (94 °C, 3 min) was followed by 35 cycles consisting of an annealing temperature of 38.7 °C (30 s), a polymerization step (72 °C, 2 min), and denaturation (94 °C, 30 s). The last polymerization step was extended to 15 min.For the determination of the complete sequence of the gene encoding the ring fission dioxygenase, a partial inverse PCR was performed (22Pang K.M. Knecht D.A. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 1046-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The template was prepared by digesting the chromosomal DNA of strain BN12 with PsuI (for the 3′-sequence) or NcoI (for the 5′-sequence), each of which possessed one restriction site within the 0.7-kb sequence obtained from the initial PCR experiment. The fragments obtained were religated using T4 DNA ligase. Thus intramolecular ligation of these DNA fragments resulted in circular DNA molecules, which were then used as a template for the following PCR. Primers for the PCR experiments were deduced from the sequence of the incomplete gene present on the 0.7-kb PCR product previously obtained and were facing in both directions outward from the known DNA sequence. The following nucleotide primers were used for the amplification of the DNA sequence 3′ of the known part of the dioxygenase gene: Paul-fwd, 5′-ATTGGGGCCTATCGCTGG-3′, and Paul-rev, 5′-CTGATCGGTGTCGTTGTGG-3′. For the determination of the nucleotide sequence encoding the amino terminus of the protein, the primers NcoI-fwd 5′-CGCATGTCTCGTGGC-3′and NcoI-rev 5′-CTTCGGCTGCATTGC-3′ were used. For the amplification reactions the following PCR programs were used: an initial denaturation (94 °C, 3 min) was followed by 35 cycles consisting of an annealing temperature of 55 (for the 5′-sequence) or 60 °C (for the 3′-sequence) (30 s each), a polymerization step (72 °C, 2.5 min), and denaturation (94 °C, 30 s). The last polymerization step was extended to 15 min. The PCR products were initially cloned into the T-tailed EcoRV-site of pBluescript II KS(+) (23Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar).Expression of the Dioxygenase in E. coli—For expression in E. coli, the dioxygenase gene was inserted in the plasmid vector pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) under the control of the T7 promoter. The DNA segment encompassing the dioxygenase gene was amplified by PCR (using a Pwo DNA-polymerase; Peqlab). The upstream primer (5′-GGAGGTCCATATGCAGAACG-3′) incorporated an NdeI site (underlined), and the downstream primer (5′-CGGGATCCTCACTTCTGCCCCTCG-3′) incorporated a BamHI site (underlined). The amplified product was cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II KS(+). The resulting plasmid was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI and the DNA fragment with the dioxygenase gene ligated into pET28a, which was also previously cut with NdeI and BamHI. The resulting plasmid (pJPH100exN) was subsequently transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The expression of the dioxygenase gene was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as suggested by the supplier of the pET system.Purification of the His-tagged Enzyme—Cell extracts of E. coli JM109(pJPH100exN) were prepared in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 8) as described above. The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was suspended in Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 8) and transferred (2 ml) to an empty 10-ml polypropylene column. The filled column was equilibrated with a buffer system (pH 8) consisting of Tris-HCl (20 mm), NaCl (300 mm), and imidazole (50 mm). The cell extracts (about 100 mg of protein) were applied to the column, and the protein was eluted with subsequent steps of the Tris-HCl/NaCl buffer (2–4 ml each) with increasing imidazole concentrations (50, 60, 150, and 500 mm). The fractions with dioxygenase activity eluted at an imidazole concentration of 150 mm. The imidazole was removed from the active fractions on a “HiTrap desalting column” (Amersham Biosciences) using Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 8) plus 100 mm NaCl as eluent buffer.Cloning of the Presumed Gentisate 1,2-Dioxygenase from C. glutamicum—The gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of C. glutamicum by using the oligonucleotide primers GDO-Cglu-fwd 5′-CACATATGGGCGCCCCAGG-3′ and GDO-Cglu-rev 5′-CAGGATCCCTAGATTCCTTCCGGAG-3′, which simultaneously introduced NdeI and BamHI cleavage sites (underlined). The following PCR program was used: an initial denaturation (94 °C, 3 min) was followed by 30 cycles consisting of annealing at 54.5 °C (for 30 s), polymerization at 72 °C (for 90 s), and denaturation at 94 °C (for 30 s). The last polymerization step was extended to 5 min. The PCR product was initially cloned into the T-tailed EcoRV site of pBluescript II KS(+). Finally, the gene was isolated from positive clones by using the restriction enzymes NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the expression vector pJOE2702 under the control of an l-rhamnose-inducible promoter (24Volff J.N. Eichenseer C. Viell P. Piendl W. Altenbuchner J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1037-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Stumpp T. Wilms B. Altenbuchner J. Biospektrum. 2000; 6: 33-36Google Scholar).DNA Sequencing and Nucleotide Sequence Analysis—The DNA sequence was determined by dideoxy chain termination with double-stranded DNA of clones and overlapping subclones in an automated DNA sequencing system (ALFexpress-Sequencer, Amersham Biosciences) with fluorescently labeled primers or nucleotides.Sequence analysis, data base searches, and comparisons were done using the NCBI facilities. The alignment of the ring fission dioxygenases was obtained with the program Clustal using the default parameters.Chemicals—The chemicals used were obtained from Aldrich, Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany), Merck, Serva (Heidelberg, Germany), and Sigma. 6-Aminonaphthalene-2-sulfonate was kindly provided by Bayer AG (Leverkusen, Germany). The complex media were purchased from Difco and Oxoid (Wesel). The suppliers of the substituted salicylates have been described previously (26Rubio M.A. Engesser K.-H. Knackmuss H.-J. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reagents for molecular biology were supplied by Invitrogen, Peqlab (Erlangen, Germany), MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany), New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany), and Roche Applied Science.RESULTSOxidation of Different Salicylates by Resting Cells of P. salicylatoxidans BN12—It was demonstrated previously that the enzyme from P. salicylatoxidans BN12 oxidized salicylate, gentisate, 5-aminosalicylate, and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate by an 1,2-dioxygenolytic cleavage (15Hintner J.-P. Lechner C. Riegert U. Kuhm A.E. Storm T. Reemtsma T. Stolz A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6936-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This ring fission mechanism principally allows the cleavage of various substituted salicylates. Therefore, resting cells of P. salicylatoxidans BN12 were incubated with a wide range of substituted salicylates, and the substrate-dependent oxygen uptake rates were determined. These experiments suggested that the bacteria were also able to oxidize a wide range of methyl-, chloro-, or bromo-substituted salicylates. Most surprisingly, the cells oxidized 5-fluorosalicylate with its exceptionally electronegative fluorine substituent with higher rates than salicylate (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Relative oxygen uptake of resting cells from P. salicylatoxidans BN12 after addition of different salicylates.

The purified dioxygenase was digested with trypsin, and several peptides were isolated by HPLC. The amino acid sequences of the amino terminus and five internal fragments were determined and used for the design of oligonucleotide primers for PCR experiments (Table II). Using genomic DNA of P. salicylatoxidans BN12 as template and primers derived from the amino-terminal sequence and of the peptide P28 (Table II), a DNA fragment with a size of about 0.7 kb was amplified. The amplified fragment was sequenced, and the sequence obtained was used to complete the sequence of the gene by using partial inverse PCR (see “Material and Methods”). Thus a continuous stretch of DNA of 1249 bp was obtained. The gene for the salicylate dioxygenase was unequivocally identified in this sequence by the presence of the amino-terminal region and the internal peptides determined before by Edman degradation (Fig. 2).Table IISequences of the amino terminus, tryptic peptides, and deduced oligonucleotidesProtein or peptideAmino acid sequenceDeduced oligonucleotide sequencesAmino terminusMQNEKLDHESVTQAMQPKDTPELRALYKS5′-CA(AG)GCNATGCA(AG)CC-3′P28WEFTDR5′-(AG)TCNGT(AG)AA(TC)TCCCA-3′P32WSTLLRP36ALTEQLLLEDEGQPATVAPGHAAIRP52ALGLANPGLGGNAYISPTM Open table in a new tab Fig. 2DNA sequence and amino acid sequence of the salicylate dioxygenase from P. salicylatoxidans BN12.

The gene encoded a protein consisting of 368 amino acids which corresponded to a molecular mass of 41,176 Da. This value agreed with the molecular mass of the dioxygenase subunits (45 kDa) determined earlier by SDS-gel electrophoresis after purification of the enzyme from P. salicylatoxidans BN12 (15Hintner J.-P. Lechner C. Riegert U. Kuhm A.E. Storm T. Reemtsma T. Stolz A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6936-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The deduced complete amino acid sequence showed significant sequence similarities with different gentisate 1,2-dioxygenases and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate 1,2-dioxygenases from different bacteria (Fig. 3). The highest degree of sequence identity (31%) to proteins with a known function was observed with a gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas alcaligenes NCIMB 9867 (27Feng Y. Khoo H.E. Poh C.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 946-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yet a much higher degree of sequence identity (58%) was found to a presumed gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase that had been identified in C. glutamicum in the course of a genome project.Fig. 3Conversion of various substituted salicylates by cell extracts from E. coli JM109 (pJPH100exN). The reaction mixtures contained in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm of the respective salicylate and 1–140 μg of protein. The spectra were recorded every minute against a reference cuvette, which contained the same amount of protein in Tris-HCl buffer but in which the respective substrates were omitted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Expression of the Dioxygenase Gene in E. coli—The dioxygenase gene was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of strain BN12 by using a set of primers that created new NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The amplified fragment was then ligated into plasmid pBluescript II SK+ (previously cut with EcoRV) and finally into the expression vector pET28a, which resulted in the addition of an amino-terminal His tag in the synthesized proteins. The resulting expression plasmid (pJPH100exN) was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3), and the dioxygenase gene was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. A comparison of SDS-PAGE gels from induced and uninduced cells of E. coli BL21(DE3)(pJPH100exN) demonstrated the induction of an additional protein with a molecular mass of about 45 kDa. The dioxygenase activity of these cell extracts with salicylate as substrate was 0.43 units mg–1 of protein. This was about 25-fold higher compared with the activity found in the wild-type strain of P. salicylatoxidans BN12. The His-tagged dioxygenase was purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (see “Materials and Methods”). This resulted in an enzyme preparation that was more than 95% homogenous, according to SDS-PAGE, and that converted salicylate as substrate with a specific activity of about 2 units/mg protein.Spectrophotometric Analysis of the Substrate Conversion by the Purified Dioxygenase—The oxygen uptake experiments with resting cells of P. salicylatoxidans (see above) suggested a broad substrate specificity of the salicylate 1,2-dioxygenase activity. It was demonstrated previously that the conversion of salicylate, 5-amino-, and 5-hydroxysalicylate and also 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate could be analyzed spectrophotometrically because of the pronounced UV-visible spectra of the products formed (15Hintner J.-P. Lechner C. Riegert U. Kuhm A.E. Storm T. Reemtsma T. Stolz A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6936-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reactions of other salicylates were also analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy. Thus it was found that cell extracts of the recombinant E. coli strain converted 3-, 4-, and 5-substituted amino-, hydroxy-, chloro-, bromo-, and methylsalicylates (Fig. 3). The conversion of all isomers of the chloro- and bromosalicylates (and also of 5-fluorosalicylate which was the only available fluorosalicylate) resulted in the formation of products with absorption maxima in the range of λmax = 290–302 nm. The turnover of the methylsalicylates also resulted in the initial formation of new absorbance maxima in the range from 293 to 300 nm. The changes in the spectra observed during the"

GATA-4 is required not only for normal heart development but is also involved in hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes; however, the effects of FOG-2 on these responses are unknown. The interaction of GATA-4 with a transcriptional coactivator p300 is required for its full transcriptional activity and the activation of the embryonic program during myocardial cell hypertrophy. We show here that exogenous FOG-2 represses phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic responses such as myofibrillar organization, increases in cell size, and hypertrophy-associated gene transcription. Using immunoprecipitation Western blotting, we demonstrate that FOG-2 physically interacted with p300 and reduced the binding of GATA-4 to p300. In addition, in COS7 cells, in which the function of endogenous p300 is disrupted, FOG-2 is unable to repress the GATA-4-dependent transcriptional activities; however, FOG-2 markedly repressed the p300-mediated increase in the DNA-binding and transcriptional activities of GATA-4 in these cells. Similarly, FOG-2 inhibited a phenylephrine-induced increase in the p300/GATA-4 interaction, the GATA-4/DNA-binding, and transcriptional activities of GATA-4-dependent promoters in cardiac myocytes as well. These findings demonstrate that FOG-2 represses hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes and that p300 is involved in these repressive effects.

FOG-1 is coexpressed with GATA-1, -2, and -3 and is involved in the differentiation of hematopoietic cell lineages (1Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M.

In contrast, FOG-2 is coexpressed with GATA-4, -5, and -6 in the heart through developmental and adult stages (2Svensson E.C. Tufts R.L. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FOG-2 physically interacts with the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA-4, and this interaction is required for normal morphogenesis of the heart during organogenesis. FOG-2—/— mice embryos are lethal at midgestation, and their hearts are characterized by a thin ventricular myocardium, a common atrioventricular canal, tetralogy of Fallot malformation, and the absence of coronary vasculature (4Tevosian S.G.

Disrupting the GATA-4/FOG-2 interaction by replacement of a single amino acid within GATA-4 results in embryonic lethality because of a remarkably similar constellation of cardiac defects (6Crispino J.D.

FOG-2 protein has been reported to repress GATA-4-dependent transcriptional activities in cardiac myocytes and in fibroblasts (3Lu J.R. McKinsey T.A. Xu H. Wang D.Z. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4495-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar); however, the precise mechanisms by which FOG-2 perturbs the transcriptional activities of GATA-4 are unknown at present. A repressor domain of FOG-2 has been mapped to the N-terminal region and shown to be distinct from the GATA-4-binding domain (7Svensson E.C. Huggins G.S. Dardik F.B. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20762-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FOG-2 does not exhibit repressive effects in certain cell types (3Lu J.R. McKinsey T.A. Xu H. Wang D.Z. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4495-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although FOG-2 associates with the potent transcriptional corepressor C-terminal-binding protein-2, repression by FOG-2 occurs even in the absence of this corepressor (7Svensson E.C. Huggins G.S.

These findings suggest that alternative mechanisms are involved in FOG-2-mediated repression of the GATA-4 transcriptional activity.GATA-4 not only plays a critical role in various stages of cardiogenesis but also is one of the transcriptional factors that regulate hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes (8Herzig T.C. Jobe S.M. Aoki H. Molkentin J.D. Cowley Jr., A.W. Izumo S. Markham B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7543-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 9Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M.

During myocardial cell hypertrophy, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK-1)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2) results in the phosphorylation of serine residues in GATA-4, which enhances its transcriptional potency. Overexpression of GATA-4 in the heart is sufficient to induce cardiac hypertrophy in vivo, although expression of a dominant-negative form of GATA-4 in cardiac myocytes blocks agonist-induced hypertrophy (10Liang Q.

Although FOG-2 can repress GATA-4-dependent transcriptional activities, the effects of exogenous FOG-2 on myocardial cell hypertrophy are unknown at present.The full transcriptional activity of GATA-4 requires its interaction with an adenovirus-associated protein, p300 (11Dai Y.S.

La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p300—/— mouse embryos show abnormal heart development characterized by defects in cardiac muscle differentiation and in trabeculation, which leads to embryonic death (14Yao T.P.

In the hearts of these mice, the expression of cardiac muscle structural proteins, such as myosin heavy chain and α-actin, is clearly reduced. These findings are compatible with in vitro data showing that p300 is required for cardiac-specific transcription and for differentiation of cardiac myocytes (15Hasegawa K. Meyers M.B. Kitsis R.N. J.

Because the zinc finger domains of GATA-4 are required for its interaction with p300, we have hypothesized that a multizinc finger protein, FOG-2, may also associate with p300. If so, considering the limiting amounts of p300 in cardiac nuclei, it might be possible that FOG-2/p300 association affects the binding of GATA-4 to p300.For these reasons, in the present study we investigated whether FOG-2 can repress hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes and, if so, whether p300 is involved in this process. We show here that exogenous FOG-2 represses myocardial cell hypertrophy as well as GATA-4-dependent transcription. In addition, we provide the first evidence that FOG-2 interacts with p300 and competes with GATA-4 for binding p300, which might be one of the mechanisms by which FOG-2 represses GATA-4-dependent transcription in the presence of p300.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection—Primary neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were prepared as described previously (15Hasegawa K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). To detect prepro-ET-1 and GAPDH mRNAs, we carried out RT-PCR. Sequences of primers and precise conditions for RT-PCR were described previously (24Yanazume T. Hasegawa K. Wada H. Morimoto T. Abe M. Kawamura T. Sasayama S. J. Biol.

Signals of mRNAs were quantified by densitometry using NIH Image 1.61, and the levels of β-MHC, ANF, and prepro-ET-1 mRNAs were normalized relative to those of GAPDH mRNA.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Double-stranded oligonucleo-tides for GATA-4 were designed based on the rat ET-1 upstream sequence that contains the GATA motif. The sequence of the sense strand of this oligonucleotide was 5′-CCTCTAGAGCCGGGTCTTATCTCCGGCTGCACGTTGC-3′. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Kurabo Inc. and purified by PAGE. Sp-1 consensus double-stranded oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog no. sc-2502)Electronic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out as described previously (9Hasegawa K.

For cold competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was included in the binding reaction mixture. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 4% nondenaturing PAGE in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA at 4 °C.Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests or analysis of variance with Scheffe's test where appropriate, with a probability value <0.05 taken to indicate significance.RESULTSFOG-2 Represses Hypertrophic Responses in Cardiac Myocytes—To examine the effects of exogenous FOG-2 on hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes, primary cardiac myocytes prepared from neonatal rats were transfected with an expression vector encoding β-galactosidase (pCMVβ-gal), wild-type FOG-2 (pwtFOG-2), or mutant FOG-2 unable to bind GATA-4 (p(1–247)FOG-2). These cells were subsequently stimulated with saline or 10—5m phenylephrine (PE), an α1-adrenergic agonist, for 48 h and stained with an antibody against β-MHC. As shown in Fig. 1A, cardiac myocytes stimulated with PE displayed increases in cell size and myofibrillar organization compared with saline-treated cells. These PE-induced changes were inhibited by transfection of pwtFOG-2. As shown in Fig. 1B, the PE-induced increases in myocardial cell surface area were significantly inhibited by transfecting pwtFOG-2 but not by transfecting p(1–247)FOG-2 (compare lanes 4–6), but wild-type FOG-2 or mutant FOG-2 alone did not affect myocardial cell surface area under the basal condition (i.e. in saline-treated cardiac myocytes) (compare lanes 1–3). These data suggest that FOG-2 specifically repressed PE-induced growth of cardiac myocytes.To examine the effects of FOG-2 on expression of hypertrophy-associated genes such as β-MHC, ANF, and ET-1, we performed Northern blotting or RT-PCR in cardiac myocytes transfected with pwtFOG-2 or pCMVβ-gal. As shown in the top and middle panels of Fig. 2A, FOG-2 almost completely inhibited the PE-induced up-regulation of the expression of the endogenous β-MHC and ANF genes (compare lanes 1, 3, and 4). FOG-2 alone, however, did not affect the basal level of these transcripts (compare lanes 1 and 2). Neither PE treatment nor pwtFOG-2 transfection affected the expression of the ubiquitously expressed GAPDH mRNA (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). The expression levels of β-MHC and ANF mRNAs were quantified and normalized relative to those of GAPDH mRNA. As shown in Fig. 2B, the PE-induced relative expression levels of β-MHC and ANF mRNAs were reduced by pFOG-2 transfection nearly to their control levels. Expression of prepro-ET-1, a precursor form of ET-1, was semiquantified by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2C, stimulation of cardiac myocytes with PE increased prepro-ET-1 levels in pCMVβ-gal-transfected cells. Expression of FOG-2 but not that of p(1–247)FOG-2 almost completely inhibited the PE-induced increase in prepro-ET-1 mRNA levels. Taken together, these data demonstrate that exogenous FOG-2 can selectively suppress the PE-induced hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes.Fig. 2Northern blot analysis of the expression of endogenous ANF, β-MHC, and GAPDH genes. Neonatal rat ventricular cardiac myocytes were transfected with 2.0 μg of either pwtFOG-2 (+) or pCMVβ-gal (—), as indicated. Subsequently, the cells were treated with saline (SS) or PE (1.0 × 10—5 m) for 48 h. Blots containing total RNA (10 μg) from these myocytes were sequentially hybridized with an isoform-specific antisense deoxyoligonucleotide complementary to rat β-MHC mRNA, with a rat ANF cDNA and with a rat GAPDH cDNA. A, representative photographs. B, signals were quantified by densitometry using NIH Image 1.62, and the levels of β-MHC and ANF mRNAs relative to the level of GAPDH mRNA were determined. The relative mRNA level in saline-treated cardiac myocytes transfected with pCMVβ-gal was set at 1.0. Values are the means ± S.E. from three independent experiments. C, RT-PCR analysis of the expression of endogenous prepro-ET-1 and GAPDH genes was performed as described previously (24Yanazume T. Hasegawa K. Wada H. Morimoto T. Abe M. Kawamura T. Sasayama S. J.

Because the zinc finger domains of GATA-4 are required for its interaction with p300, we speculated that a multizinc finger protein, FOG-2, may also associate with p300. Therefore, to investigate the physical interactions between FOG-2 and p300, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. COS7 cells were transfected with pwtFOG-2 and pCMVp300. Nuclear extracts from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-p300 antibody, anti-FOG-2 antibody, and normal rabbit IgG as a negative control. These immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blotting using the anti-p300 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, an interaction between FOG-2 and p300 was clearly observed even after extensive washing (upper panel, lane 2). The anti-p300 antibody was stripped and then the membrane was reprobed with the anti-FOG-2 antibody. Similarly, an interaction between FOG-2 and p300 was observed (lower panel, lane 1). These findings demonstrate that FOG-2 physically interacts with p300.Fig. 3FOG-2 interacts with p300. COS7 cells were transfected with 4.0 μg of pwtFOG-2 and 8.0 μg of pCMVp300. Nuclear extracts prepared from these cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with the anti-p300 antibody (lane 1), the anti-FOG-2 antibody (lane 2), and with control IgG (lane 3). After SDS-PAGE, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting using the anti-p300 antibody (upper panel).

Nuclear extracts from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GATA-4 antibody, control IgG as a negative control, and anti-p300 antibody followed by Western blotting using the anti-p300 antibody. As shown in the left top panel of Fig. 4A, an interaction between GATA-4 and p300 was observed in pcDNA3-containing nuclear extracts (lane 1), in agreement with findings reported previously (9Hasegawa K.

Kawase Y. Hirai M. Kita T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3593-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Notably, the interaction was reduced in wild-type FOG-2-containing extracts (lane 2) compared with pcDNA3-containing extracts (lane 1). In accordance with the fact that p(1–247)FOG-2 is unable to bind with GATA-4, this mutant FOG-2 did not reduce the p300/GATA-4 interaction (lane 3) as the wild-type did (lane 2). The levels of p300 proteins immunoprecipitated with the anti-p300 antibody were similar among these three groups of samples (Fig. 4A, left, bottom panel). After the anti-p300 antibody was stripped, the membrane was reprobed with the anti-GATA-4 antibody. As shown in the right bottom panel of Fig. 4A, expression of the wild-type FOG-2 but not the mutant FOG-2 reduced the p300/GATA-4 interaction, similar with the results in the left top panel.

It binds specifically to α-hemoglobin (α-Hb) subunits acting as a chaperone protein, preventing the formation of α-hemoglobin-cytotoxic precipitates. We have engineered recombinant AHSP in a pGEX vector to study the functional consequence of interaction between AHSP and α-Hb. By in vitro binding assays, we have isolated the complexes glutathione S-transferase-AHSP·α-Hb and AHSP·α-Hb. The latter assembles as a heterodimer based on size-exclusion chromatography. These complexes exhibited monophasic CO binding kinetics, as observed for isolated α- and β-subunits of hemoglobin. However, the rate of CO (or oxygen) binding to α-hemoglobin bound to its chaperone is three times slower than that observed for isolated α-hemoglobin, demonstrating a form that is intermediate to the R- and T-hemoglobin states. The physiologically relevant replacement of the chaperone by β-hemoglobin chains could be detected by both ligand binding kinetics and tryptophan fluorescence quenching.

The physiologically relevant replacement of the chaperone by β-hemoglobin chains could be detected by both ligand binding kinetics and tryptophan fluorescence quenching. The poor solubility of α-chains has remained a puzzle during many decades of hemoglobin research. Special protocols were developed in order to store isolated α-hemoglobin chains (α-Hb), 1The abbreviations used are: α-Hb, α-hemoglobin subunit; AHSP, α-Hb-stabilizing protein; β-Hb, β-hemoglobin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase protein. and most genetic engineering studies involved the modification of the β-chains (β-Hb) because of the poor expression yield of the α-chain preparations. The common conclusion was that, in order to avoid unfolding, nascent α-chains must rapidly encounter its partner β-Hb. The discovery of an α-chaperone would change that scenario and possibly the molecular origin of certain thalassemias associated with denatured α-chains (1Thein S.L. Steinberg M.H. Forget B.G. Higgs D.G. Nagel R.L. Disorders of Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2000: 342-355Google Scholar). Kihm et al. (2Kihm A.J. Kong Y. Hong W. Russel J.E. Rouda S. Adachi K. Simon M.C. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) have described recently a protein induced by GATA-1, an essential erythroid transcription factor that is present at a high level (0.1 mm) in human red blood cell precursors and may act as a chaperone for protecting freshly synthesized α-Hb. This protein, named α-hemoglobin-stabilizing protein (AHSP), also known as being the product of the “erythroid differentiation-related factor gene,” is confined to the erythroid lineage and is down-regulated in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (3Miele G. Manson J. Clinton M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It binds to α-chains but not to β-chains or to hemoglobin tetramers. AHSP was proposed to maintain the solubility of α-chains, preventing them from forming cytotoxic precipitates as observed in β-thalassemias where they are in large excess or in some unstable hemoglobin variants altering subunit contact areas within the tetramer. More recently, dos Santos et al. (4dos Santos C.O. Duarte A.S. Saad S.T. Costa F.F. Exp. Hematol. 2004; 32: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that, during maturation of the red blood cell precursor, there is a progressive increase in AHSP gene expression following the expression of the α-globin gene, confirming an important function of AHSP during erythropoiesis. AHSP is a 102-residue protein whose cDNA and gene have been characterized (GenBank™ AF147435 and AY072612). Some properties of the AHSP·α-Hb complex have already been studied by Gell et al. (5Gell D. Kong Y. Eaton S.A. Weiss M.J. Mackway J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40602-40609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The AHSP and α-Hb are both monomers in solution and form a heterodimer complex with an association constant of 107m–1 at 20 °C, compatible with a physiological role (5Gell D. Kong Y. Eaton S.A. Weiss M.J. Mackway J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40602-40609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). AHSP exhibits some similarities with human tubulin chaperone cofactor A and Rbl2p, its yeast homolog. These chaperone molecules are involved in the tubulin-folding process. α-Tubulin and β-tubulin form a heterodimer that polymerizes to form the microtubule. Free excess β-tubulin is toxic for the cell. It has been shown that Rbl2p and cofactor A bind monomeric β-tubulin to form a heterodimer both in vivo and in vitro (6Archer J.E. Vega L.R. Solomon F. Cell. 1995; 82: 425-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the Rbl2p/cofactor A function was the protected cell from free β-tubulin by binding transiently until it associated with α-tubulin (7Abruzzi K.C. Smith A. Chen W. Solomon F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The regions of cofactor A interacting with β-tubulin have been characterized in the three-dimensional structure of the molecule (8Guasch A. Aloria K. Perez R. Avila J. Zabala J.C. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For a better understanding of the stabilizing role of AHSP on α-Hb, we studied the CO recombination kinetics to determine whether the binding of AHSP modifies the properties of α-Hb. The kinetics, as well as the fluorescence of the single tryptophan of AHSP, allows the observation of the replacement of AHSP by β-Hb. Preparation of α-Hb and β-Hb—After reaction of human Hb with p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, the α-Hb and β-Hb were purified by cation-exchange chromatography as described previously (9Bucci E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Geraci G. Parkhurst L.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4664-4667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. They were saturated with carbon monoxide and stored frozen at –80 °C. Recombinant Plasmid Constructs—Human cDNA was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR from erythroid cells with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen). The primers used for PCR were 5′-GGGGGATCCATGGCTCTTCTTAAGGCCAATA-3′ and 5′-AAACTCGAGCTAGGAGGAGGGCGGTGG-3′. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 70 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s (50 cycles). The cDNA band was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, cut from the gel, and purified using a QiaQuick kit (Qiagen). It was then digested with BamHI and XhoI and desalted on a microspin HR400 column (Amersham Biosciences). This fragment was ligated in-frame with glutathione S-transferase protein (GST) into pGEX-4T-1 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences), and the AHSP gene-coding sequence was checked (MWG Biotech, Courtaboeuf, France). Expression and Solubilization of GST-AHSP—The pGEX-AHSP construct was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The GST fusion protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of the GST-AHSP was done in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. After cell harvest and centrifugation, the cell pellet was suspended in PBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 1 g/liter lysozyme. After a 45-min incubation on ice, the cells were disrupted in a Sonifier II disrupter (Branson Ultrasonic, Carouge-Geneva, Switzerland) by a maximum of 3 pulses of 10 s each avoiding frothing. The sonicated solution was incubated in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 for 1hat4 °C with slight agitation. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. In Vitro Binding Assays—After centrifugation, the supernatant containing the GST-AHSP was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h with a volume ratio of 4:1 (supernatant:bead). The beads were washed by 10 (bead) volumes of PBS. CO-bound α-Hb in PBS was added in a previous mixture for 1 h. After incubation, the beads were washed with a 30-bead volume of PBS and then the GST-AHSP·α-Hb complex was eluted by adding a 2-bead-volume of glutathione buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The same preparation was performed with β-Hb. Thrombin Cleavage—1 ml of GST-AHSP or GST-AHSP·α-Hb complex bound to bulk beads was incubated with 120 units of thrombin under gentle agitation at room temperature for 5 h. After centrifugation, the AHSP or AHSP·α-Hb was in the supernatant while GST remained bound to the matrix. In this construct, an additional Gly-Ser dipeptide remains at the N terminus of the AHSP. Study of the GST-AHSP·α-Hb or AHSP·α-Hb Complex—The different products of in vitro binding assays were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and revealed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. These different products were also analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superose™ 12 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted at 25 °C with a 150 mm Tris acetate buffer (11Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Baudin-Creuza V. Fablet C. Zal F. Green B.N. Prome D. Marden M.C. Pagnier J. Wajcman H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), pH 7.5, or with PBS, pH 7.4. Kinetics of CO recombination were obtained after flash photolysis using 10-ns YAG laser pulses (Quantel, Les Ulis France) at 532 nm. Samples were in 4 × 10-mm quartz cuvettes with observation at 436 nm. Measurements were made at 25 °C, pH 7.4, 100 μm CO (13Marden M.C. Kister J. Bohn B. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The complexes GST-AHSP·α-Hb or AHSP·α-Hb alone were first studied, and then β-Hb was added. Fluorescence studies were performed on samples in PBS using an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL) at room temperature. Emission spectra were recorded for both the buffer and different protein solutions in quartz cuvettes of a dimension of 3 × 3 or 4 × 10 mm. The excitation wavelength was at 280 nm, and emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm. Production and Size Characterization of GST-AHSP and AHSP—After expression in BL21 and solubilization, GST-AHSP was purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. AHSP was obtained after thrombin cleavage of the bead-bound GST-AHSP. SDS-PAGE indicated that GST-AHSP and AHSP amounted to >95% of the eluted proteins. In this system, GST-AHSP and AHSP showed apparent molecular masses of 26 and 12 kDa, respectively, as predicted from the amino acid sequence of GST-AHSP and AHSP. Size-exclusion chromatography on Superose 12 10/300 GL column in Tris acetate 150 mm buffer showed that both GST-AHSP and AHSP elute as a single species. Based on a calibration curve, the elution volume of GST-AHSP and AHSP corresponded to 151.3 kDa (Ve = 11.55 ml) and 22.9 kDa (Ve = 14.34 ml), respectively, with typical uncertainty of 0.5 kDa (Fig. 1, A and B). These values are consistent with GST-AHSP-forming tetramers (3.97 subunits) and AHSP-forming dimers (1.9 subunits). The width of the GST-AHSP peak at half-height (0.73 ml) suggested that GST-AHSP had some degree of size heterogeneity. In contrast, the AHSP peak width at half-height was smaller and constant (0.54 ml), indicating that AHSP has a high degree of size homogeneity and stability. The same experiments were repeated at a higher ionic strength with PBS to decrease ionic interactions (Fig. 1C). GST-AHSP eluted at a higher volume corresponding to a molecular mass of 60 kDa, consistent with a dimer species as reported for recombinant GST (14Walker J. Crowley P. Moreman A.D. Barrett J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the peak width at half-height (1.89 ml) was larger, indicating a mixture of forms of a different size. The elution profile of AHSP had little change, displaying a molecular mass of 20 kDa, consistent with a dimer species of narrow peak width at half-height (0.54 ml). Normally for molecular species that associates reversibly into multimers, the eluted peak profile by size-exclusion chromatography shifts with a decreasing concentration. Irrespective of the applied concentration of AHSP (from 50 μm to 0.8 μm) in Tris acetate buffer, this molecular chaperone eluted at the same volume (Ve = 14.35 ml) corresponding to 22.8 kDa. This result indicates that this elution peak of AHSP is not sensitive to concentration, indicating a stable dimer or possibly that it could reflect a monomeric form with a non-globular geometry of the molecule as reported by Gell et al. (5Gell D. Kong Y. Eaton S.A. Weiss M.J. Mackway J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40602-40609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Complex of GST-AHSP and AHSP with α-Hb—The GST-AHSP·α-Hb or AHSP·α-Hb complex was studied by in vitro binding assays. GST-AHSP bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B was incubated with α-Hb. The fixation of α-Hb on GST-AHSP imparted a red color on the Sepharose matrix, demonstrating a specific complex between α-Hb and AHSP as shown in Reaction 1.AHSP+α-Hb→AHSP·α-Hb Reaction 1 After elution by glutathione buffer, a red eluate was obtained. When the same experiment was done with β-Hb solution, the matrix remained uncolored, indicating no β-Hb binding. A soluble red AHSP·α-Hb complex was generated by thrombin cleavage of GST-AHSP·α-Hb bound to the matrix. Size-exclusion chromatography on Superose 12 10/300 GL column in Tris acetate 150 mm buffer at pH 7.5 showed that GST-AHSP·α-Hb was eluted as a single species at a volume corresponding to a molecular mass of 179 kDa (Ve = 11.3 ml) (Fig. 1B). The value is slightly lower than that expected for a tetramer of GST-AHSP·α-Hb (∼200 kDa); however, the addition of the α-chain may not significantly increase the overall hydrodynamic radius and thus the elution volume. The AHSP·α-Hb complex also eluted as a single species at a volume corresponding to 33.7 kDa (Ve = 13.75 ml) (Fig. 1, A and B). This value is the result of the formation of an AHSP·α-Hb heterodimer. The dissociation equilibrium of this dimer could be studied by the concentration dependence of the elution profile. Irrespective of applied concentration of this complex (from 25 to 1 μm on a heme basis), the complex was eluted at the same volume corresponding to a heterodimer. The peak width at half-height remained small and constant (0.6 ml), indicating that the heterodimer does not dissociate easily and that the association constant is very high as reported by Gell et al. (5Gell D. Kong Y. Eaton S.A. Weiss M.J. Mackway J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40602-40609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Kinetic Studies—The recombination traces after photodissociation of CO are shown in Fig. 2. For the GST-AHSP·α-Hb complex, similar for α-Hb controls, the recombination kinetics were monophasic. Generally, isolated α-Hb or β-Hb subunits as well as αβ-dimers exhibit a single rapid phase that is similar in rate to the high affinity R-state Hb tetramer. The rate for CO recombination to the GST-AHSP·α-Hb complex exhibits a rate much slower than that of free α-Hb subunits. The same recombination kinetics was observed with the AHSP·α-Hb complex (Fig. 2), i.e. after cleavage of GST by thrombin. This shows that the influence of AHSP on α-Hb is a 3-fold decrease in the rate of CO rebinding to α-Hb. A similar effect for the kinetics of oxygen binding (data not shown) was observed. When β-Hb was added to the GST-AHSP·α-Hb or AHSP·α-Hb complexes, the CO recombination kinetics became biphasic as expected for tetrameric Hb, showing the two phases corresponding to the two allosteric states. This result implies a dissociation of the complex GST-AHSP·α-Hb or AHSP·α-Hb, allowing the α-Hb subunits to associate with β-Hb to form the α2β2-tetramers (Reaction 2). This demonstrates the physiological reaction expected for a chaperone.AHSP·α-Hb+β-Hb→AHSP+α2β2tetramers Reaction 2 The control reconstitution of α-Hb with β-Hb (without AHSP) also showed kinetics typical of Hb tetramers but with less of the slow phase, characteristic of the deoxy (T-state) conformation. The relative amplitude of slow phase is highly dependent on pH, effectors, and sample history (such as reconstitution). Native Hb will show slightly more of the slow phase relative to reconstituted tetramers. In the present case, one could argue that the yield for reconstitution of allosteric tetramers is higher in the presence of AHSP. Fluorescence Studies—The heme group is an excellent energy acceptor and highly quenches tyrosine or tryptophan fluorescence within Hb subunits, typically by a factor of 50. Because the chaperone has a single Trp and no heme group, the fluorescence intensity can be used to detect the formation of the complexes (Reactions 1 and 2) and to estimate the Tyr to α-heme distance. The fluorescence of AHSP was typical of an exposed Trp and showed little Tyr contribution (Fig. 3). The AHSP·α-Hb complex (step 1) indicated a decrease by nearly a factor of 3 in intensity; note that the α- or β-chain fluorescence is negligible (Fig. 3). Based on the classical Forster energy transfer theory (15Forster T. Discuss. Faraday Soc. 1959; 27: 7-17Crossref Google Scholar), assuming a random orientation for the donor acceptor pair, the Trp to α-heme distance would be 29 Å. Note that, in the case where the α-Hb chains are added to the cuvette containing AHSP, a significant Tyr fluorescence (with peak near 305 nm) remained. Addition of β-Hb subunits to the AHSP·α-Hb complex leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity as expected if the AHSP is released and replaced by the β-chains. In this case, the Trp to α-heme distance would be 36 Å. This indicates that the distance is increased in the presence of β-Hb subunits. The recovery of fluorescence is not complete, even after correction for the inner filter effect, suggesting that an incomplete dissociation of the AHSP or the structure of free AHSP was not identical after complexing with α-Hb. AHSP binds rather tightly to hemoglobin α-chains. Experiments at lower concentrations still showed the signal typical of the complex. This was the case for the elution profiles, CO kinetics, or fluorescence. The most sensitive experiment is the elution volume versus concentration easily capable of detecting the Hb tetramer to dimer transition near 1 μm. No transition was observed for dissociation of the AHSP·α-Hb complex, indicating a Kd <100 nm. However, the AHSP is easily replaced by β-chains within 1 min as detected by the CO binding kinetics or the AHSP fluorescence so the affinity is probably not much higher than the reported value of 100 nm. The CO rebinding kinetics indicate a significant change in the α-Hb properties in the AHSP·α-Hb complex with a decrease in the on-rate by a factor of three. The CO on-rate for the low affinity (T-state) Hb is ∼30 times slower than the R-state. Thus, the AHSP·α-Hb complex is intermediate and could be classified as a perturbed or R′-state. Note that strong effectors such as inositol hexa(kis) phosphate induce large effects in the T-state but are rarely more than a factor of 2 for the R-state. An intermediate R2 structure has been described and proposed as being perhaps the true solution R-state, differing from the previously determined R-state (16Mueser T.M. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15353-15364Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Orientation of Binding—The association between α-Hb and β-Hb leads to formation of an αβ-dimer involving the α1β1-type contact. These αβ-dimers associate further into tetramers, forming a second type (α1β2) of interface. In the formation of the complex between AHSP and α-Hb, we considered two possible models involving the different interfaces. AHSP could be coupled to the α-chain via an α1β2-type contact (Fig. 4, Model 1), an orientation favoring the association of α-Hb with β-Hb into α1β1-type dimers. In the free β-chains, which associate spontaneously into β4-tetramers, the residues that participate in the α1β1-contact are exposed toward the exterior of the molecule (17Borgstahl G.E. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 817-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For this reason, one may hypothesize that, in the complex formed by AHSP and α-Hb, the B, G, and H helices and the GH corner of the α-Hb, which are involved in the α1β1-packing contact, are exposed toward the exterior and do not participate in the binding with AHSP. This packing contact has been recognized to be essential in avoiding heme oxidation and stabilizing the dimers (18Shikama K. Matsuoka A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4041-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this model, there is the possibility of a ternary complex AHSP·α·β with AHSP released only upon Hb (αβ)2-tetramer formation. At a low Hb concentration or with a natural variant that tends to dimerize such as Hb Rothschild, the AHSP would not necessarily dissociate. An alternate model would be the α1β1-type contact for AHSP binding. In this case, the AHSP must dissociate before the β-chain can bind (Fig. 4, Model 2). If one treats the AHSP as a pseudo-β-chain, certain comparisons can be made. The single tryptophan residue in AHSP (position 44) would correspond to that in position 37 of the β-subunit. The β37-Trp has a distance to neighboring α-chains of 15 Å for the interdimer (α1β2) and 29 Å for the intradimer (α1β1) pair based on energy transfer quenching (15Forster T. Discuss. Faraday Soc. 1959; 27: 7-17Crossref Google Scholar). The observed fluorescence quenching supports the hypothesis that AHSP occupies the α1β1-position. This binding would also be compatible with the observed affinity, since the interdimer complex is relatively weak (1 μm). However, after displacement by the β-chain, the chaperone might occupy the secondary site of weaker affinity. The exact stoichiometry would then depend on the overall αβ-concentration. At a low concentration, the dimers will be present. Under native conditions of the high Hb concentration, there will be a high percentage of tetramers. The present results show the expected complex between the chaperone and α-Hb with an intermediate stability not nearly as high as the αβ-complex. Thus, our data demonstrate the physiologically relevant reaction of replacement of AHSP by native β-chains. In addition, a new oxygen affinity was observed for the AHSP·α-Hb complex being intermediate to the R- and T-allosteric states. For intact Hb tetramers, it is difficult to separate the contribution of the α- and β-chains. It is also difficult to extract an intermediate affinity because of the allosteric nature of Hb. The partially liganded species are never highly populated. The AHSP·α-Hb complex allows the isolation of a new state with an affinity approximately three times lower than the classical R-state."
https://openalex.org/W2001542325,"The mRNAs for all three members of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) family are widely expressed, and the proteins are highly similar. They have potential to both hetero- and homodimerize through their bHLHLZ domains, so it has been difficult to definitively study the role of each one apart from the other two. In the current study, we have utilized cell lines that express only one functional SREBP and the chromatin immunoprecipitation technique to analyze individual SREBP binding to three specific target genes: hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (Red), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and squalene synthase (SQS). Our studies show that SREBP-2 binds to promoters for all three genes, and in agreement with the original report using these cells, all three mRNAs are also induced. In the line expressing only SREBP-1a, mRNAs for Red and FAS are induced, but SQS is not. Chromatin immunoprecipitation also shows that SREBP-1a is recruited efficiently to Red and FAS promoters but not to SQS. This observation indicates SREBP-2 selectively binds the SQS promoter and is sufficient to explain the lack of SQS mRNA induction in the SREBP-1a-expressing cells. SREBP-1c protein was not stably recruited to any SREBP target promoter despite being fully active in DNA binding when purified from extracts of the corresponding cells. This is also sufficient to explain the lack of SREBP target gene induction by the singular expression of SREBP-1c. We also show that whereas SREBP-1a and -2 proteins interact efficiently with transcriptional co-activators that modify cellular chromatin, SREBP-1c does not. Taken together, our data support a model suggesting that chromatin modification is required during the initial stage of specific site recognition by SREBPs in native chromatin in vivo.

There are three very similar proteins in this family; SREBP-1a and -1c are encoded by overlapping mRNAs from a single gene, and SREBP-2 is the product of a distinct genetic locus (1Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar, 2Osborne T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1873-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Primary transcripts for SREBP-1a and -1c mRNAs initiate from different promoters; each has a unique first exon that is spliced to the same second exon, and the remaining coding sequences are indistinguishable. Thus, the two corresponding proteins are identical except for the amino acids encoded in the first exon. In SREBP-1a there are 28 unique amino acids, whereas in SREBP-1c there are only four specific residues in addition to the initiator methionine. Because the transcriptional activation domain is located at the extreme amino terminus (3Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 209: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), the two proteins differ in their ability to stimulate transcription. 1a is a relatively potent transcriptional activator that efficiently interacts with the twin coactivators CBP and p300 (4Oliner J.D. Andresen J.M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) as well as the multisubunit mammalian mediator complex (5Nåår A.M. Beaurang P.A. Robinson K.M. Oliner J.D. Avizonis D. Scheek S. Zwicker J. Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 6Nåår A.M. Beauring P.A. Zhou S. Abraham S. Solomon W. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In contrast, 1c is a very poor transcriptional activator. The activation domain of SREBP-2 is similar to 1a, and it is also a potent transcriptional activator. A major goal in the study of any gene family is to distinguish the separate and overlapping functions for the individual members. Studies to tease out the individual roles for the different SREBPs have included analyzing expression patterns in different tissues, responses to specific regulatory cues, and overexpression as well as genetic studies in cultured cells and gene-targeted mice (1Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar). When taken together, these studies indicate that SREBP-1 is selectively associated with fatty acid regulation, and SREBP-2 is preferentially involved in sterol regulation. However, there is significant overlap, and because all three SREBPs are widely expressed and have the potential to homo- and heterodimerize, there is even the possibility of selective roles for specific homoas well as heterodimeric SREBP complexes. This has complicated the conclusions from regulatory and most overexpression studies, because they have been performed under conditions where the other two SREBP isoforms are also expressed. To specifically evaluate target gene selectivity in the SREBP family, Pai et al. (7Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) took advantage of a mutant CHO cell line that cannot express any active SREBPs from endogenously expressed proteins. This mutant cell line has a deletion in the gene encoding the site 2 protease, which is absolutely required for releasing the precursor SREBPs from their membrane tether (8Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T.T.Y.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Without this cleavage, SREBPs remain anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and fail to accumulate in the nucleus. Pai et al. (7Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) established transfected cell lines that stably express the mature, nuclear targeted form of each individual SREBP isoform in an ecdysone-inducible expression cassette in the background of the site 2 protease mutant cell line. In the original report using these cell lines, expression of either SREBP-1a or SREBP-2 proteins induced mRNAs from most SREBP target genes roughly equivalently. There were two notable exceptions. Squalene synthase (SQS) was activated efficiently by SREBP-2 but was not stimulated above base line by SREBP-1a, and HMG-CoA reductase was efficiently stimulated by SREBP-2 but was stimulated to a lesser degree by SREBP-1a. Importantly, the singular expression of SREBP-1c was insufficient to activate any SREBP target gene above base-line levels despite being expressed at the same level as SREBP-1a or -2 protein in the companion cell lines. The reasons for the selective activation of SQS and to a lesser degree HMG-CoA reductase by SREBP-2 and the complete absence of activation of any SREBP target gene by SREBP-1c have not been established. To address these questions, we have utilized the chromatin immunoprecipitation technique (ChIP) to evaluate SREBP binding to selective promoters in these mutant CHO cell lines. In the experiments reported here, we show that the promoters for HMG-CoA reductase and SQS selectively bind SREBP-2, and the promoter for fatty acid synthase (FAS) binds both SREBP-1a and -2 equivalently. In contrast, we show that SREBP-1c does not stably associate with the promoters of any of these three genes, although when the protein is purified from the corresponding cells it efficiently binds to an SREBP target site in vitro. We also show that although SREBP-1a and -2 both interact efficiently with the co-activators CBP/p300, SREBP-1c is defective in this crucial function. Thus, our results for promoter binding in vivo and coactivator binding in vitro are sufficient to explain the differential patterns of gene expression observed previously (7Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). When integrated together, our new data form the basis of a model to explain the lack of SREBP-1c binding to its target DNA sites in cellular chromatin. Cell Cultures and Media—Stock flasks of M19-transfected cells expressing SREBP-1a, -1c, or -2 (7Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were cultured in a 50/50 mixture of Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (Irvine Scientific) containing penicillin and streptomycin, glutamine, Hepes, pH 7.2, 500 μg/ml G418 sulfate, 1 mm mevalonic acid, 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 20 μm oleate, 500 μg/ml Zeocin. Incubation was at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For each time course, 30 dishes (15 cm) were plated at 8,000,000 cells/dish on day zero in the above medium without Zeocin. After 24 h, the cells were induced with ponasterone A. The ponasterone A concentrations were 3 μm for the cells expressing either SREBP-1c or SREBP-2 and 0.3 μm for the SREBP-1a cells. There were three dishes used for each time point, and cells were induced for 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, or 8 h. Ponasterone additions were staggered so that all dishes were harvested at the same time. Chromatin Collection and Cross-linking—A modification of our earlier protocol was used (9Bennett M.K. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After ponasterone induction, formaldehyde was added directly to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1% (v/v), and the dishes were gently shaken on a platform shaker at room temperature for 8 min. Glycine was added to 125 mm, and the dishes were returned to the shaker for an additional 5 min. Dishes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and harvested by scraping into 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cells from triplicate dishes were pooled and collected by centrifugation in a Sorvall RC3B at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were discarded. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS plus 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were collected by centrifugation as above and resuspended in 5 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 plus protease inhibitors (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Samples were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min before homogenization with three strokes of a glass Dounce homogenizer with a B pestle to release nuclei. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation as above, and the supernatants were discarded. Nuclei were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS plus protease inhibitors as above (50 μl/15-cm dish of cells). Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, and immunoprecipitation dilution buffer A (0.01% SDS, 1.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 167 mm NaCl) was added to bring the volume to 750 μl. Samples were sonicated using 10-s bursts from a Branson sonifier model 450 with a microtip on a setting of 4. Routinely, seven repetitions of the sonication were performed, and the formaldehyde cross-link was reversed on a small aliquot of the material, and the degree of DNA fragmentation was verified by gel electrophoresis before proceeding. We routinely sonicate the chromatin so that the DNA is fragmented to an average size of 300–500 bp. If needed, sonication is repeated until this size distribution is achieved. Samples are diluted a total of 20-fold by the addition of more immunoprecipitation dilution buffer and then normalized by A260 and stored in 0.5-ml aliquots at –80 °C. FLAG Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin samples (500 μl) were first precleared with mouse preimmune serum (20 μl) in the presence of protein G-Sepharose (Roche Applied Science) bead slurry (60 μl of a 50/50 slurry of beads in TBS (16.7 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 167 mm NaCl), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). Samples were incubated for 2 h at4 °C on a rotator, and beads were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 2000 × g. The unbound material (chromatin) was transferred to a new tube, and 28 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) were added. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotator, 60 μl of blocked protein G slurry were added, and incubation was continued on the rotator for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were transferred into microspin columns (Bio-Rad) to collect during the beads after the washing steps. Beads were first washed twice with 500 μl of ice-cold buffer B (0.05% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v), Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl), washed once sequentially with buffer D (0.05% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl), buffer 3 (0.25 m LiCl, 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1.0% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA), and buffer C (0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA). Beads were transferred to a siliconized microcentrifuge tube, and bound material was eluted by incubating the beads with 75 μl of elution buffer (0.1 mm sodium bicarbonate, 1.0% (w/v) SDS) while vortexing for 10 min. This was repeated a total of four times. The four eluates were pooled, and NaCl and RNase were added to 300 mm and 10 μg, respectively, and samples were heated at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse the Schiff's base linkage. DNA was collected using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis—For each reaction, 1 μl of the DNA eluate from the FLAG precipitation was used. All PCRs were analyzed in triplicate, and 30–40 cycles were used, depending on which conditions were established for the linear phase of the amplification protocol for each primer pair using the input DNA as a control. The amounts of DNA eluate used from the immunoprecipitation were chosen so that the signals achieved were in the linear range of the input PCR curve. Separate input curves for each oligonucleotide pair were included in each separate PCR experiment for accuracy. This ensures that the PCRs are within the linear range of the amplification cycle and that comparisons can be made between different promoters. The DNA sequences for the primers are as follows. For HMG-CoA reductase oligonucleotides (–230 to +13 was amplified) the sequences are 5′-CACGGCTCAGGGACCAATAA-3′ and 5′-AAGGAACTGAGCTTACGCAC-3′. For squalene synthase oligonucleotides (–237 to –3 was amplified), the sequences are 5′-ATCACGCCAGACTCCTTCGGCCTC-3′ and 5′-TAGCTCCACGGGTGTCCAGATATTA-3′. For fatty acid synthase oligonucleotides (–115 to –20 was amplified), the sequences are 5′-GCGCAGCCCCGACGCTCATT-3′ and 5′-CGGCGCTATTTAAACCGCGG-3′. The ethidium bromide band intensities were measured using BioRad gel imaging software. Background values (samples where primary antibody was omitted from the immunoprecipitation) were subtracted, and the intensities were calculated as a percentage of the input DNA signal. Immunoblotting—Aliquots of each normalized (by A260) chromatin preparation (10 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. An aliquot of the same sample expressing SREBP-1a was used as a standard reference for comparison and normalization on every gel. Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose at 4 °C for 2 h. The filters were blocked overnight in TBS plus 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk at 4 °C and reacted with a FLAG primary antibody (M2; Sigma) at a 1:2000 dilution in TBS plus 0.5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. An anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody was used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:1000 dilution in TBS with 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Filters were then developed with the SuperSignal kit (Pierce). For immunoblotting of the samples to analyze the efficiency of the FLAG immunoprecipitation, 10-μl equivalents (normalized for eluted volume) of each eluate were analyzed by this same protocol. RNA Analysis—RNA was extracted (Trizol; Invitrogen) from cells that were cultured in companion dishes induced with ponasterone as above. Total RNA (25 μg) from each time point was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. The gels were treated by standard methods for RNA transfer and hybridization with probes for HMG-CoA reductase, squalene synthase, and fatty acid synthase as described (10Shin D.-J. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34114-34118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Cells expressing SREBP-1a or -1c were plated at 2,000,000 cells/15-cm dish and cultured for 48 h prior to the addition of ponasterone A (3 μm ponasterone A for 4 h for the cells expressing SREBP-1a and 10 μm ponasterone A for 24 h for the cells expressing SREBP-1c). Cells were harvested by scraping into 1× PBS and collected by centrifugation in an RC3B (5 min at 4000 rpm). Cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The resulting nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, and the cytoplasmic extract supernatants were discarded. The nuclei were resuspended in 2 ml of extraction buffer (0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, plus protease inhibitors as above). This was incubated for 30 min on ice, and then insoluble nuclear debris was removed after centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. The nuclear extract supernatant was removed to a new tube, and glycerol was added to 10% before storage at –80 °C. SREBPs were purified using 800 μl of FLAG-agarose bead slurry 50/50 (Sigma). Proteins were incubated with beads for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator followed by washing with 5 column volumes of buffer A and 5 column volumes of buffer Z 0.1 (25 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol). Bound proteins were eluted with successive 50-μl elutions in Z 0.1 buffer containing a peptide with three copies of the FLAG epitope sequence (100 μg/ml). Fractions containing SREBP (detected by a FLAG immunoblot) were pooled and normalized for SREBP levels again by immunoblotting. Equal amounts of SREBP-1a- and SREBP-1c-immunoreactive protein were used in a standard EMSA reaction (11Vallett S.M. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) with 5 ng of a probe containing an SREBP binding site that was labeled with 32P by T4 kinase. The sequence of one strand of the oligonucleotide is 5′-CTAGGGGCATCACCCCACCGACGGCGGCGCGCCGGGTCCCGGGGCGCAGCCCCGACGCT-3′. Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—Expression and preparation of GST fusion proteins have been described (12Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To 25 μl of glutathioneagarose beads (Sigma), 500 μg of the indicated crude GST fusion protein extract and 1 ml of Z′0.1 buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) plus 0.5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and 5 mm dithiothreitol) were added followed by an incubation on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 2 h. The bound GST fusion proteins were pelleted in a microcentrifuge, and nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing the pellets three times with 1 ml of Z′0.1 buffer. Then 150 μg of total protein from HeLa nuclear extract were added to the bound proteins along with 1 ml of Z′0.1 buffer, and samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotating wheel. The reactions were pelleted again and washed three times with 1 ml of Z′0.1 buffer, and the specifically bound proteins were sedimented along with the agarose beads, resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using either anti-nuclear factor Y-A antibody (Rockland), or anti-p300 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the primary reactant. Amino acids 1–451 or 452–721 of human CBP (containing the C/H1 or KIX domains, respectively) were independently fused to GST, and the corresponding fusion proteins were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli. Equal amounts (18 μm final concentration in the binding reaction) were bound to glutathione-agarose beads; 3 mg of nuclear extract from ponasterone-induced mutant CHO cells expressing either SREBP-1a, -1c, or -2 (prepared as described above) were added; and the mixtures were processed as described above and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody to FLAG-tagged SREBPs as described above. Pai et al. (7Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) inserted DNA encoding the mature forms for each of the three SREBP isoforms into an ecdysone-inducible expression cassette. Two copies of the FLAG peptide epitope were added at the carboxyl terminus to allow relative protein expression levels to be estimated by immunoblotting. These constructs were transfected into a mutant CHO line that cannot express endogenously derived SREBPs due to a deletion in the gene encoding the site 2 protease, which is absolutely required for SREBP to traffic to the nucleus (8Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T.T.Y.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The resulting cell lines were shown to induce nuclear SREBP expression in a hormone-inducible fashion, and the concentration of the ecdysone analog, ponasterone, was independently adjusted in each cell line to provide relatively similar levels of the different SREBP proteins in the nucleus at 24 h postinduction. When SREBP target gene activation was evaluated in this original study, most SREBP target genes were induced efficiently by either SREBP-1a or -2. In contrast, SREBP-1c did not enhance expression of any target gene above the base-line level. Additionally, HMG-CoA reductase was activated more efficiently by SREBP-2 than SREBP-1a, and SQS mRNA induction was only observed in the line expressing SREBP-2. The reasons for the different patterns of activation were not totally clear, because SREBP-1a and -1c contain the same DNA binding domain. Also, there were some indications from transfection and transgenic overexpression studies that genes of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism may be selectively activated by SREBP-2 (13Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and SREBP-1a (14Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) respectively, but the absolute preference for SREBP-2 activation of SQS was surprising. We were interested in evaluating whether the results for SREBP target gene activation in these cell lines were due to the selective association of the different SREBPs to the respective promoters in vivo using the ChIP technique. To analyze the binding of SREBPs to specific target gene promoters, we used an antibody to the FLAG peptide, which was common to all three SREBPs. Because we wanted to evaluate relatively early events in the activation process, we performed a time course for ponasterone-dependent induction of SREBP nuclear accumulation in the different cell lines, and we adjusted the ponasterone concentration to achieve similar levels of SREBP proteins over the time course period (data not shown). When the appropriate conditions were established, we performed the experiment in Fig. 1 and measured the accumulation of SREBP protein over time up to 8 h postinduction. Representative immunoblots are presented in Fig. 1A, and the different signal intensities were measured and plotted as shown at the bottom of Fig. 1. For purposes of comparison, a control sample from one preparation of protein from the SREBP-1a-expressing cell line was analyzed on every gel for normalization of different films. The level of each protein is plotted relative to the signal intensity for SREBP-1a at 4 h, set at 100%. SREBP-1a was induced the earliest, and it reached a maximal level by 4 h and started to decline by 8 h. The kinetics for SREBP-1c and -2 induction were slightly delayed, but they accumulated to similar levels as SREBP-1a (Fig. 1). As a control, an aliquot of the isolated chromatin from each time point was tested in a PCR to confirm that equal DNA recoveries were achieved in the different cell lines and at the different time points analyzed (Fig. 2). The data in Figs. 2, B–D, also demonstrate that the PCR signal intensities used throughout this report with all three promoters reside within the linear phase of PCR. The remaining portions of the chromatin samples were then subjected to an immunoprecipitation protocol with the FLAG antibody to capture the DNA-bound SREBPs. Aliquots of each sample after the immunoprecipitation were first evaluated by an immunoblotting analysis to assess the efficiency and consistency of the immunoprecipitation protocol. At each time point, the FLAG-tagged SREBPs were efficiently and consistently collected by the immunoprecipitation procedure in proportion to their total overall levels (Fig. 1A, compare the gels labeled Pre for direct Western blot with those labeled Post for after immunoprecipitation). Portions of the remaining samples after the immunoprecipitation were subjected to PCR with primers designed to amplify the SREBP binding regions of the hamster promoters for HMG-CoA reductase (Fig. 3), squalene synthase (Fig. 4), and fatty acid synthase (Fig. 5). These three promoters were chosen because they are representative of the three patterns for SREBP target responses in the study of Pai et al. (7Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Representative gels for the PCRs are shown with duplicate reactions in A of Figs. 3, 4, 5. The signal intensities from the PCR gels were measured and are plotted as a function of time along with RNA levels for each gene under study.Fig. 4SREBP binding to the squalene synthase promoter.

To address this issue, the transcriptional activity of the mouse and human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was analyzed on two model glucocorticoid-responsive promoters. Mouse GR (mGR) displayed unique promoter discrimination in response to a range of glucocorticoids, with enhanced activity on a simple glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-based promoter and diminished activity on the complex mouse mammary tumor virus promoter compared with human GR (hGR). Promoter discrimination between mGR and hGR was mapped to a single amino acid change at residue 437 (glycine to valine) of mGR and to sequence differences within individual GREs of the different promoters. Mouse GR displayed higher activation on GREs with a guanine rather than a thymine at the –6 position. Binding studies indicated mGR (mGR437V) displayed a weaker affinity for GREs containing a thymine at the –6 position than a mGR mutant containing a glycine at residue 437 (mGR437G). Despite distinct transcriptional activities, both receptors had similar affinities for response elements that contain a guanine at the –6 position. Our findings support a model by which the presence of a valine residue at position 437 of mGR induces a conformational change that leads to alterations in affinity and/or transcriptional activation in a promoter-dependent context.

The biological actions of glucocorticoid hormones are mediated through the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR), 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; DBD, DNA binding domain; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GAR-HRP, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; hGR, human GR; LBD, ligand binding domain; LUC, luciferase; mGR, mouse GR; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MTIIA, metallothionein IIA; TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; TO, tryptophan oxygenase. which belongs to the nuclear receptor subfamily that includes receptors for mineralocorticoids, estrogen and thyroid hormones, retinoic acid, and vitamin D (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar). In the absence of hormone, GR resides in the cytoplasm as a multiprotein complex with the chaperone proteins Hsp90 and Hsp70, the immunophilin p59, and the phosphoprotein p23 (2Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Upon binding hormone, GR dissociates from this complex and undergoes a conformational change that unmasks nuclear localization signals found within the receptor (3Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The GR translocates to the nucleus and binds glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) as a dimer in the promoter regions of target genes (4Hard T. Dahlman K. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Rigler R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5358-5364Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Hard T. Kellenbach E. Boelens R. Maler B.A. Dahlman K. Freedman L.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. Yamamoto K.R.

Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). The association of the glucocorticoid receptor dimer with the response element results in an allosteric induced conformational change within the receptor and subsequent recruitment of coactivator complexes critical for chromatin remodeling and transcription (4Hard T.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The functional result of the GR-GRE interaction can be largely cell type-, promoter-, and ligand-specific. In some instances, the GR binds negative GREs in promoters of genes and inhibits gene transcription (8Webster J.C. Cidlowski J.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 396-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GR represses gene transcription by physically interacting with other transcription factors such as AP-1 and nuclear factor-κB (8Webster J.C. Cidlowski J.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 396-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M.

Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1222-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As with other members of the nuclear receptor family, the GR contains a modular structure consisting of three major domains: an N-terminal domain, a central DNA binding domain (DBD), and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) (12Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 13Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain represents the most variable region among the species of the GR and the nuclear receptor family. The N-terminal domain contains the AF-1 transcriptional activation domain required for transcriptional enhancement and association with basal transcription factors (12Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 13Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 14Kumar R. Thompson E.B. Steroids. 1999; 64: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The central DBD is composed of two highly conserved zinc finger regions and is most conserved region among nuclear receptors (15Freedman L.P. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The first zinc finger is primarily thought to be responsible for target site recognition. Three residues in the carboxyl half of the first zinc finger termed the “P box” are thought to be responsible for response element discrimination (16Danielson M. Hinck L. Ringold G.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1131-1138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 17Mader S. Kumar V. de Vereneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The second zinc finger stabilizes protein-DNA interactions and contains the “D box” region critical for receptor dimerization (5Hard T. Kellenbach E. Boelens R. Maler B.A. Dahlman K. Freedman L.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. Yamamoto K.R. Gustafsson J.A. Kaptein R. Science. 1990; 249: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 6Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). The central DBD is also required for the repression of other transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB and AP-1 (9Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 11McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1222-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Tao Y. Williams-Skipp C. Scheinman R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2329-2332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The C-terminal LBD serves as the binding site for hormones, chaperone Hsp90, and coactivators (12Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 14Kumar R. Thompson E.B. Steroids. 1999; 64: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In addition, the DBD and LBD are important determinants in receptor mobility (19Schaaf J.M. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1922-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The GR is an evolutionary conserved transcription factor found in such species as human, rat, mouse, frog, rainbow trout, flounder, and others. The highest sequence homology exists among mammalian species, particularly in the highly conserved DBD and LBD. Nonmammalian species display less homology overall, both in conserved (DBD, LBD) and variable domains (N terminus) of the GR. Despite relatively high sequence homology, striking differences in glucocorticoid sensitivity have been observed among mammalian species. In some instances, species-specific differences in glucocorticoid action result from amino acid changes within functional domains of the GR protein. For example, the guinea pig displays resistance to cortisol because of the presence of several amino acid residues in the LBD which differs from the human GR (hGR) (20Keightly M.C. Curtis A.J. Chu S. Fuller P.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2479-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similarly, sequence differences in the LBD are responsible for humans and other cortisol-secreting species (rabbit, pig) displaying a higher affinity for cortisol than rodents (rat, mouse), which bind corticosterone with a higher affinity (21Giannopoulos G. Kelchline D. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 1414-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation patterns vary among species, providing a mechanism for species-specific differences in phosphorylation-influenced functions of GR which include protein stability, transcriptional activation, and subcellular localization (22Webster J.C. Jewell C.M. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9287-9293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 23Rogatsky I. Waase C.I.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26573-26580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For example, glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibits the transcriptional activity of rat GR through phosphorylation but has no effect on hGR (24Wang Z. Frederick J. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26573-26580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Alternatively, species-specific differences in GR signaling may result from the elevated expression of proteins that alter GR function. For example, the elevated expression of the FK506-immunophilin FKBP51 causes glucocorticoid resistance in several New World primates by decreasing binding of glucocorticoids to GR (25Scammell J.G. Denny W.B. Valentine D.L. Smith D.F. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2001; 124: 152-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, the dominant-negative form of the GR, hGRβ, is expressed in humans but not other species (26Otto C. Reichardt H.M. Schutz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26665-26668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the molecular basis for species-specific differences in the transcriptional activation of simple and complex promoters by mouse GR (mGR) and hGR in response to glucocorticoid agonists and antagonists. Our studies reveal that mGR displays distinct promoter-specific transcriptional activities compared with hGR. A comprehensive analysis of GR domains and hormone-responsive promoters indicated that promoter discrimination mapped to a single amino acid at residue 437 of the DBD of mGR and to the identity of the –6 position of the GRE. Materials—Specific antibodies against GR protein (57Malkoski S.P. Handanos C.M. Dorin R.I. Mol. Cell.

Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (GAR-HRP) was purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Dexamethasone, cortisol, corticosterone, triamcinolone, and RU486 were purchased from Steraloids (Wilton, NH). Construction of Receptor Mutants—Glucocorticoid receptor DBD mutants were generated with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit as specified by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primer sequences used to generate the following mutants were: mGR437G, 5′-ccgatgaagcttcggatgccattatggggtgc-3′; mGR437H, 5′-ccgatgaagcttcgcactgccattatggggtgc-3′; mGR437L, 5′-ccgatgaagctttatgccattatggggtgc-3′; mGR437A, 5′-ccgatgaagcttcggcatgccattatggggtgc-3′; mGR437D, 5-ccgatgaagcttcggactgccattatggggtgc-3′; hGR430V, 5′-gtgctctgatgaagcttcagtatgtcattatcgagtcttaac-3′; rGR449V, 5′-ccgatgaagcttcagtatgtcattacgggg-3′. DBD-VP16 fusion constructs were constructed by PCR. The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the DBD of mGR (amino acids 414–524) was amplified from the pCMVmGR using the primers 5′-tataggtaccggcaccatgtcagtgttttc-3′ and 5′-tatagatatccacctccagcagtgacacca-3′. The product was digested with KpnI and EcoRI enzymes and ligated into digested pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The VP16 activation domain was amplified from pAct (Clontech) with primers 5′-tatagatatctcgacggcccccccgacc and 5′-tatactcgagttatccccgacccgggaat-3′. The product, digested with EcoRI and XhoI, was then inserted downstream of the DBD to generate the pcDBD437V-VP16 fusion expression vector. The expression vector pcDBD437G-VP16 was generated by mutagenesis using mGR437G primers as described above. Construction of Reporter Gene Constructs—The TAT2-LUC reporter gene was generated by excising a BamHI-HpaI fragment from GRE2-CAT (28Allgood V.E. Oakley R.H. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20870-20878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which contained the TAT GREs and TATA box sequence. The fragment was subcloned into BamHI-HpaI sites of pXP2 plasmid (29Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter gene MMTV-LUC (pHH-LUC) has been described previously (29Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). To generate single GRE luciferase reporter genes, the tandem GREs were excised from the plasmid TAT2-LUC by restriction analysis with BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were generated which correspond to the GREs from the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV; 30), rat tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT; 31), human metallothionein (MTIIA; 32), and tryptophan oxygenase (TO; 33) genes (34Beato M. Chalepakis G. Schauer M. Slater E.P. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 32: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide contained BamHI and XhoI sites and was subsequently ligated into previously digested plasmid. The sequences of oligonucleotides used were: TAT, tataggatccctctgctgtacaggatgttctagctacctcgagatata; MMTVI, tataggatcctttttggttacaaactgttcttaaaacctcgagatata; MMTVII, tataggatcctggtttggatcaaaggttctgatctgc tcgagatat; MTIIA, tataggatccgcacccggtacactgtgtcctcccgctctcgagatat; and TO, tataggatcctgctccctttcatgatgcctggcccactcgagatat. The chimeric TAT2-MMTV reporter gene was generated by excising a Sal-EcoRV fragment from TAT2-LUC, which contains the TATA box sequence and luciferase gene. A fragment containing the TATA box, NF-1, Oct-1, and luciferase gene was then amplified by PCR from MMTV-LUC with primers 5′-ggtactcgagtttggaattttatccaa-3′ and 5′-ggggccacctgatatcctt-3. The PCR product was digested with XhoI-EcoRV and inserted into the SalI-EcoRV-digested TAT2 plasmid to generate the full-length TAT2-MMTV reporter gene. Cells and Growth Conditions—COS-1 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). E8.2 cells were a gift from Dr. Paul Housley (Department of Pharmacology, Physiology, and Neurobiology, University of South Carolina). All cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. All cultures were maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and passaged every 3–4 days and used in experiments during a 2-month period. Eukaryotic Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—Approximately 0.75 × 105 cells/20-mm dish or 2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish were plated and incubated at 37°C for 16–24 h. Cell culture medium was then removed and replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The appropriate plasmid vector and reporter gene were transfected with TransIT as detailed by the manufacturer (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI). The transfection complexes were incubated with cells for 8 h, removed, and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. After a 24-h recovery, the appropriate steroid or vehicle control was added to the cells and incubated for an additional 16–24 h. Cells were then scraped in 1× reporter gene assay buffer (Roche Applied Science) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 nm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin). Cell lysates were vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. After a brief centrifugation at 15,000 × g, luciferase activities were determined as detailed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science) using a Dynex Technologies (Chantilly, VA) luminometer microplate reader. For determination of protein expression, cell lysates were processed for Western blot analysis as detailed below. Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysates were prepared by briefly sonicating cell lysates prepared in 1× reporter lysis buffer as detailed above. Protein concentrations were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein samples were resolved on 8% precast Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose using the Hoefer semiphor semidry electrophoretic system (Amersham Biosciences) as detailed by the manufacturer. Blots were stained with a 1:2,000 dilution of anti-GR antibody (57Malkoski S.P. Handanos C.M. Dorin R.I. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 127: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-β-actin (Sigma) in TTBS (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.15% Tween, pH 7.5) supplemented with 5% dry milk for 1 h at 22 °C, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Blots were washed with three changes of TTBS for a total of 45 min. Blots were then incubated in TTBS buffer with 5% dry milk containing a 1:10,000 dilution of GAR-HRP for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TTBS, bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit as specified by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Multiple exposures of each set of samples were produced and were within the linear range established for each antibody. Competitive DNA Binding ELISA—The GREs utilized in the ELISAs were generated by annealing biotinylated oligonucleotides (IDT, Coralville, IA). The sequences of the GREs used were: TAT GRE, 5′-aagctttgtacaggatgttctaagctt-3′; and MMTVI GRE, 5′-tttttggttacaaactgttcttaaaac-3′. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were quantified with the PicoGreen double-stranded DNA quantitation kit as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). A DNA binding ELISA was performed essentially as described previously (35Renard P. Ernest I. Houbion A. Art M. Calvez H.L. Raes M. Remacle J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 36Shen Z. Peedikayil J. Olson G.K. Siebert P.D. Fang Y. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1168-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 pm TAT or MMTVI was incubated in streptavidin-coated 96-well plates (Pierce) for 1–2 h. Cytosol was prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with the appropriate recombinant GR plasmid by homogenization in MENG buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Homogenates were centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and aliquots were stored at –70 °C prior to use. Protein concentrations were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The relative expression of each recombinant GR protein expressed in the cytosol was determined by Western blot analysis as described above. GR protein was activated by incubating the cytosol with 100 nm dexamethasone for 2 h at room temperature. The in vitro activated cytosol was then incubated at 22 °C for 15 min in 1× DNA ELISA buffer (20 mm HEPES, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI·dC) for a total of 100 μl. Samples were then added to 96-well plates coated previously with the biotinylated TAT GRE and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. To generate competition curves, excess cold nonbiotinylated oligonucleotides corresponding to the TAT GRE or MMTVI GRE were added to wells prior to the addition of samples. Wells were washed 10 times with PBST (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween) to remove nonbound complexes. Anti-GR antibody was diluted 1:2,000 in 1× DNA-binding buffer supplemented with 1% dry milk. 100 μl of the solution was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. Wells were washed 10 times with 1× PBST and then incubated for additional 1 h with a 1:5,000 dilution of GAR-HRP antibody in 1× DNA-binding buffer containing 3% dry milk. After a final wash, immunocomplexes were detected with the SuperSignal ELISA Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce) and luminescence measured on a microplate reader (Dynex Technologies). Competitor displacement curves were generated based on the LUC values. EC50 values were calculated using one-site competition curve analysis by GraphPad Prism software (San Diego). Amino Acid Analysis—Protein and nucleotide sequences of members of mouse and hGR were obtained using GenBank (37Benson D.A. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Rapp B.A. Wheeler D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the Nuclear Receptors data base (38Horn F. Vriend G. Cohen F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, www.receptors.org/NR). GenBank™ accession numbers for mGR and hGR are X04435 and X03225, respectively. Comparison of Promoter Activation by mGR and hGR—The transcriptional activities of the mGR and hGR were evaluated on two model glucocorticoid responsive promoters: 1) a simple GRE promoter, and 2) the complex MMTV promoter (Fig. 1A). The simple reporter gene, TAT2-LUC, contains two copies of the GRE from the rat TAT gene upstream of a TATA box sequence and the LUC reporter gene (Fig. 1A). The complex MMTV-LUC reporter gene is comprised of two dissimilar GREs, two half-site GREs (TGTTCT), and sites for the transcription factors sites NF-1 and Oct-1. Mouse GR and hGR were evaluated for their ability to activate the simple and complex glucocorticoid responsive reporter genes in COS-1 cells in response to natural and synthetic glucocorticoids (Fig. 1B). Mouse GR displayed enhanced activity on the simple TAT2-LUC reporter gene over the complex MMTV promoter (Fig. 1B). In contrast, hGR activated transcription better in the context of the complex MMTV promoter than the simple TAT2-LUC reporter gene. Mouse GR displayed ∼5-fold higher activation over hGR on TAT2-LUC and 1.6-fold less activity on the MMTV promoter in response to dexamethasone. Importantly, the promoter-specific activities were independent of the agonist tested and were observed with corticosterone, cortisol, and triamcinolone, ligands that display differing affinities for GR (27Cidlowski J.A.

The agonists represent a structurally similar class of compounds that are thought to induce similar conformational changes within the GR. The expression levels of each protein in the reporter gene assays were nearly identical as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these data revealed that mGR displayed distinct promoter-specific transcriptional activities compared with hGR in response to glucocorticoid agonists. A Single Amino Acid Change in the DBD of mGR Exerts Promoter Discrimination—We next focused on identifying the functional domains that contributed to the species-specific promoter discrimination by mGR. In preliminary studies, we examined the role of the N terminus of GR and found that the domain was not responsible for the distinct promoter activities between mGR and hGR in response to glucocorticoids (data not shown). This led us to investigate the consequence of a single amino acid change at the tip of the first zinc finger of the DBD of the mGR (Fig. 2). The mGR utilized in this study, originally reported by Danielsen et al. (44Danielsen M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), contains a valine at position 437 instead of a glycine found in hGR. The amino acid change results from codon change of GGA to GTA (44Danielsen M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number X04435) containing this nucleotide change acts as the reference standard for the mGR by genomic data bases such as NCBI SwissProt, and MGI. Residue 437 of mGR also appears to be polymorphic among mouse cell lines (45Kasai Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 46Chen F. Watson C.S. Gametchu B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 418-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similar polymorphisms have been found in the vitamin D receptor (G30D) and the androgen receptor (G551V) and have been associated with hypocalcemic rickets and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, respectively (47Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Poukka H. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Allera A. Herbst M.A. Griffin J.E. Wilson J.D. McPhaul M.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Science. 1988; 242: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The mutations in androgen receptor and vitamin D receptor appear to disrupt DNA binding and transcriptional activation properties of the receptor. Amino acid 437 of mGR is located outside the P box (Fig. 2), a region thought to act as the primary determinant of sequence recognition among glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors (16Danielson M. Hinck L. Ringold G.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1131-1138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 17Mader S. Kumar V. de Vereneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Response element specificity depends largely on the identity of the amino acids within the P box. Residues outside the P box region have been previously reported to make contacts with phosphate backbone of DNA and are thought to help provide structural information (5Hard T. Kellenbach E.

Structural elements of HIV-1 RT potentially participating in recognition of this duplex include the thumb subdomain and the ribonuclease H (RNase H) primer grip, the latter comprising elements of the connection subdomain and RNase H domain. To investigate how stabilizing HIV-1 PPT structure influences its recognition, we modified the (-) DNA template by inserting overlapping locked nucleic acid (LNA) doublets and triplets. Modified RNA/DNA hybrids were evaluated for cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction. Altered specificity was observed when the homopolymeric dA·rU tract immediately 5′ of the PPT was modified, whereas PPT/U3 cleavage was lost after substitutions in the adjacent dT·rA tract. In contrast, the “unzipped” portion of the PPT was moderately insensitive to LNA insertions. Although a portion of the dC·rG and neighboring dT·rA tract were minimally affected by LNA insertion, RNase H activity was highly sensitive to altering the junction between these structural elements. Using 3′-end-labeled PPT RNA primers, we also identified novel cleavage sites ahead (+5/+6) of the PPT/U3 junction. Differential cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction and U3 + 5/+6 site in response to LNA-induced template modification suggests two binding modes for HIV-1 RT, both of which may be controlled by the interaction of its thumb subdomain (potentially via the minor groove binding track) at either site of the unzipped region.

Recently, it was proposed that the RNase H primer grip (RHPG), involving portions of the p66 connection subdomain and RNase H domain, interacts with the DNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid, providing the RNA with a trajectory appropriate for hydrolysis within the RNase H catalytic center (4Sarafianos S.G.

These combined activities effectively prepare nascent (-) DNA for use as template for plus (+)-strand, DNA-dependent DNA synthesis.A critical step between (-)- and (+)-strand DNA synthesis is selection of the (+)-strand RNA primer from within the replication intermediate. For HIV-1, RNase H-resistant polypurine tract (PPT) sequences at the center (22Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol.

However, our chemical footprinting studies (39Kvaratskhelia M. Budihas S.R. Le Grice S.F. J. Biol.

In the absence of RT, two regions of the PPT (-) DNA template, separated by 12-13 bp, were susceptible to KMnO4 modification, suggesting a departure from standard Watson-Crick geometry. The first includes the region of the PPT referred to as unzipped in the presence of RT (4Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), whereas a second KMnO4-sensitive site was at the PPT/U3 junction. The spatial separation of KMnO4-sensitive sites approximates the distance between the MGBT of the p66 thumb and the RNase H catalytic center. Thus, interaction of the MGBT (or other elements of the thumb) with the unzipped portion of the PPT might directly affect positioning the RNase H catalytic center over the PPT/U3 junction.Although plausible, our hypothesis remains speculative, requiring additional evidence that locally altering PPT architecture, while retaining sequence context, affects RT contacts and, ultimately, cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) introduce local flexibility, we wished to examine how stabilizing the same region might affect its recognition by HIV-1 RT. To achieve this, we prepared a series of (-) DNA templates containing locked nucleic acid (LNA) analogs (47Orum H. Wengel J. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 239-243PubMed Google Scholar, 48Wengel J. Vester B. Lundberg L.B. Douthwaite S. Sorensen M.D. Babu B.R. Gait M.J. Arzumanov A. Petersen M. Nielsen J.T. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2003; 22: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These 2′-O-4′-C-methylene-linked bicyclic analogs (Fig. 1A) have the property of locking the deoxyribose ring in the C3′-endo configuration. LNA substitutions also increase the local organization of the phosphate backbone and significantly enhance the stability of nucleic acid duplexes, the latter most likely reflecting a greater degree of stacking with neighboring bases (49Petersen M. Bondensgaard K. Wengel J. Jacobsen J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5974-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Using a scanning strategy of overlapping LNA doublets and triplets in the PPT (-) DNA template, A-like duplex geometry was introduced locally throughout the PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrid and immediately adjacent dA·rU tract, alteration of which also affects PPT function (50Ilyinskii P.O. Desrosiers R.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3766-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 51Bacharach E. Gonsky J. Lim D. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4755-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our current studies indicate that modifying either extremity of the PPT impairs hydrolysis at the PPT/U3 junction, whereas the intervening sequence can be substituted with minimal consequences for hydrolysis. Finally, we demonstrate here two binding modes for HIV-1 RT on PPT-containing duplexes. These modes mediate hydrolysis at the PPT/U3 junction and 5-6 bp downstream in the U3 region, a combination that has been proposed to regulate (+)-strand synthesis in murine leukemia virus (31Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5275-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A model for each of these hydrolytic modes involving “locking” of the p66 thumb at either side of the internal PPT deformation is proposed. This positioning of RT may also in part explain resistance of the PPT to internal hydrolysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotide and Enzyme Preparation—LNA-substituted 40-nt oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized at a 1-μmol scale on a PE Biosystems Expedite 8909 synthesizer by standard phosphoramidite chemistry with the exception that coupling times for locked 5-methyl cytidine were extended to 15 min. Stepwise coupling yields for incorporation of LNA was >98%, determined by trityl cation monitoring. Sequences and sites of substitution are illustrated in Fig. 1B. LNA phosphoramidites of A, G, T, and 5-methyl cytidine were purchased from Proligo Reagents. Deprotection and cleavage of oligonucleotides from the CPG support was carried out by incubation in 30% ammonium hydroxide for 36 h at 25 °C. Oligonucleotides were purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified spectrophotometrically (260 nm) assuming a molar extinction coefficient equal to the sum of the constituent deoxynucleotides. A complementary 30-nt RNA containing the HIV-1 3′ PPT and flanking sequences at its 5′ and 3′ termini was purchased from Dharmacon Research (Boulder, CO). Hybrids were prepared by heating equimolar amounts of RNA and DNA to 95 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 25 mm NaCl for 5 min followed by slow cooling to 4 °C. Samples were stored at -20 °C. p66/p51 HIV-1 RT was purified according to Le Grice et al. (52Le Grice S.F. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).PPT Selection—PPT selection was evaluated as previously described (45Dash C.V. Rausch J.W. Le Grice S.F.J. Nuclic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using p66/p51 HIV-1 RT and 30-nt RNA/40-nt DNA hybrids. 5′-end-labeling of the PPT-containing RNA was performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, whereas 3′-end-labeling was achieved with T4 RNA ligase and [α-32P]CTP. Hybrids were generated by annealing the radiolabeled PPT RNA to each of the LNA-substituted (-) DNA templates as well as to an unsubstituted control oligodeoxynucleotide. Hydrolysis was initiated by adding RT to RNA/DNA hybrids in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 6 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C with enzyme and RNA/DNA hybrid present at final concentrations of 50 and 200 nm, respectively. Hydrolysis was terminated after 10 min by adding an equal volume of 95% (v/v) formamide containing 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol, and the products were fractionated by high voltage electrophoresis through 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels, visualized by autoradiography and/or phosphorimaging, and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy and Thermal Melting Profiles— Equimolar amounts of 30-nt RNA primer and LNA-substituted 40-nt (-) DNA templates were annealed by heating to 90 °C and slow cooling in degassed 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 80 mm NaCl. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was used to determine that complete hybridization had been achieved. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 25 °C with an AVIV 202 spectrophotometer using a 1-mm path length cuvette. Correction for each spectrum was against the buffer-only spectrum. Nucleic acid duplexes were scanned from 190 to 300 nm. For measurement of melting temperatures (Tm), 10 μg/ml solutions of the same substrates were analyzed in a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. E260 was measured at 0.2 °C intervals from 30 to 95 °C. The Tm of each hybrid was calculated by the “first derivative” method described by the manufacturer.Sensitivity of Template Thymines to KMnO4Oxidation—RNA/DNA hybrids containing dual LNA substitutions between template nucleotides -9 and -15 (defining position -1 as the first PPT base 5′ to the PPT/U3 junction) were subjected to KMnO4 oxidation as previously described (39Kvaratskhelia M. Budihas S.R. Le Grice S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16689-16696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cleavage products were fractionated by high resolution, denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and quantitated by phosphorimaging.RESULTSExperimental Strategy—The structures of the individual LNA-inducing nucleobases and strategy for their pairwise insertion into the PPT (-) DNA template are illustrated in Figs. 1, A and B, respectively. Because all four nucleobases were commercially available, this allowed us to evaluate the homopolymeric dA·rU tract immediately adjacent to the PPT, a region whose alteration affects PPT usage in HIV-1 (53McWilliams M.J. Julias J.G. Sarafianos S.G. Alvord W.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11150-11157Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), Moloney murine leukemia virus (51Bacharach E. Gonsky J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3766-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although dC was commercially available as the 5-methyl derivative, x-ray crystallography (4Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) suggests that relatively few contacts are made to nucleobases of the RNA/DNA hybrid, suggesting steric interference would be minimal. The overlapping LNA strategy also allowed us to substitute bases on either side of the junctions between homopolymeric blocks comprising the PPT.As a first step in characterizing LNA-containing RNA/DNA hybrids, CD spectra were compared with that of an unsubstituted substrate. Representative spectra are presented in Fig. 2A for each extremity of the PPT (LNA 15/14 and LNA 2/1) as well as the portion of the PPT where unusual base-pairing leads to unstacking of template base -11C (LNA 11/10) (4Sarafianos S.G.

Le Grice S.F.J. Nuclic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As might be expected for an RNA/DNA hybrid (7Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Ratmeyer L. Vinayak R. Zhong Y.Y. Zon G. Wilson W.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4326-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the spectrum of an unmodified duplex displays a positive band at 267 nm, with minima at 245 and 210 nm. Introducing adjacent LNA analogs at positions -15/-14, -11/-10, or -2/-1 induces a minor change in the 210-nm minimum, suggesting local A-like geometry. Spectra for additional LNA-substituted RNA/DNA hybrids were similar to those in Fig. 2A (data not shown). Thus, introducing adjacent A-form LNA analogs into the PPT (-) DNA template appeared to minimally perturb the structure of the RNA/DNA hybrid.Fig. 2A, representative CD spectra for -2/-1 (left), -11/-10 (center), and -15/-14 LNA-substituted PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrids. Filled and dashed lines represent wild type and mutant substrates, respectively. B,Tm values for doubly LNA-substituted PPT RNA/DNA hybrids.

As expected, substitutions in the dC·rG tract had the most significant impact, raising the Tm as much as 11 °C relative to the unsubstituted control. Interestingly, LNA substitutions of the dT·rA tracts displayed differential effects depending on their position relative to the unzipped portion of the PPT (4Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). As an example, a -14/-13 substitution raised the Tm to 58.9 °C, whereas that of a -9/-8 substituted duplex was 62.9 °C. In both cases these substitutions are internal to a 5′-TTTT-3′ sequence, minimizing the sequence context. Finally, wild type and LNA-substituted RNA/DNA hybrids migrated similarly on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, indicating that major structural distortions such as G-quartets were not induced. (data not shown).Insertion of LNA-inducing Doublets into PPT (-) DNA—The consequences of introducing LNA-inducing doublets on HIV-1 PPT selection is presented in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3A, the PPT primer was radiolabeled at its 5′ terminus. In the absence of modification (lane (-)), we observed cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction and minor cleavage at U3 positions +1 and +2. A similar pattern was observed for template substitutions -20/-19 and -19/-18 (lanes a and b, respectively), which define the extremity of the upstream dA·rU tract. A subtle change in the hydrolysis pattern is induced by LNA substitutions at positions -18/-17 and -17/-16 (lanes c and d, respectively), where cleavage at U3 positions +2 and +3 are induced in addition to the PPT/U3 junction.Fig. 3HIV-1 PPT cleavage after LNA doublet insertions into the (-) DNA template. A, 5′-end labeled PPT primer; B, 3′-labeled PPT primer. The position of the 5′ LNA analog of a doublet is given at the side of each panel for orientation, Lanes a, -20/-19; lanes b, -19/-18; lanes c, -18/-17; lanes d, -17/-16; lanes e, -16/-15; lanes f, -15/-14; lanes g, -14/-13; lanes h, -13/-12; lanes i, -12/-11; lanes j, -11/-10; lanes k, -10/-9; lanes l, -9/-8; lanes m, -8/-7; lanes n, -7/-6; lanes o, -6/-5; lanes p, -5/-4; lanes q, -4/-3; lanes r, -3/-2; lanes s, -2/-1; lanes t, -1/+1; lanes (-), unsubstituted PPT (-) DNA template. The schematic between panels A and B is included for orientation of the homopolymeric tracts of the PPT and upstream region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In contrast, altering the geometry of the distal PPT dT·rA tract between positions -16 and -12 has dramatic effects on selection. After -16/-15 and -15/-14 substitution, hydrolysis at U3 positions +1, +2, and +3 are favored over the PPT/U3 junction (lanes e and f, respectively). Cleavage at these novel sites and at the PPT/U3 junction is eliminated when template nucleotides -14/-13 and -13/-12 are substituted (lanes g and h, respectively). PPT/U3 cleavage is restored, albeit to a reduced level, after LNA substitution at positions -12/-11 (lane i). Thus, the combined data of lanes e-i in Fig. 3A suggest that PPT hydrolysis is sensitive to alterations to the geometry of the upstream dT·rA tract. This appears to be less critical for the central dT·rA tract, since substitutions between positions -11 (lane j) and -7 (lane m) do not significantly affect hydrolysis at the PPT/U3 junction.Lanes n-t of Fig. 3A address alterations to the geometry of the dC·rG tract of the PPT. Surprisingly, dramatic inhibition of hydrolysis accompanies substitution of template nucleotides -7/-6 (lane n), although a neighboring -8/-7 substitution is well tolerated (lane m). The effect of a -7/-6 substitution appears to be local, since LNA analogs between positions -6 and -4 (lanes o and p) permit hydrolysis at the PPT/U3 junction. Finally, because A-like geometry is induced in the vicinity of the PPT/U3 junction, hydrolysis is inhibited (lanes q-t). Taken together, the data of Fig. 3A suggest that either end of the PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrid is significantly less tolerant to alterations in nucleic acid geometry than the central dT·rA tract. In addition, the junction between the dC·rG and neighboring dT·rA tract appears to be particularly susceptible to alteration.Two Modes of PPT Cleavage Are Affected by LNA"

Two members of this family, GlcNAc6ST-1 and -2, collaborate in the biosynthesis of ligands for the leukocyte adhesion molecule L-selectin. Although their biochemical properties are similar in vitro, the enzymes have distinct glycoprotein substrate preferences in vivo. The sulfotransferases share similar overall architecture with the exception of an extended stem region in GlcNAc6ST-1 that is absent in GlcNAc6ST-2. In this study we probed the importance of the stem region with respect to substrate preference, localization, and oligomerization. Analysis of truncation mutants demonstrated that perturbation of the stem region of GlcNAc6ST-1 affects the cellular substrate preference of the enzyme without altering its retention within the Golgi. A chimeric enzyme comprising the stem region of GlcNAc6ST-1 inserted between the catalytic and transmembrane domains of GlcNAc6ST-2 had the same substrate preference as native GlcNAc6ST-1. In cells, GlcNAc6ST-1 exists as a dimer; two cysteine residues within the stem and transmembrane domain were found to be critical for dimerization. However, disruption of the dimer by mutagenesis did not affect either localization or substrate preference.

Like most Golgi-resident enzymes, including other sulfotransferases and glycosyltransferases, GlcNAc6ST-1 and -2 share a similar anatomy (Fig. 1).

The substrate preferences of GlcNAc6ST-1 and -2 have been studied in vitro using their truncated soluble catalytic domains and synthetic glycans (13Grunwell J.R. Rath V.L. Rasmussen J. Cabrilo Z.

In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and COS-7 cells, GlcNAc6ST-1 preferentially sulfates N-linked glycans, whereas GlcNAc6ST-2 prefers to modify O-linked glycans. Furthermore, their distribution within the Golgi compartment was found to differ in Chinese hamster ovary cells (17de Graffenried C.L. Bertozzi C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40282-40295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). GlcNAc6ST-1 resides in the trans-Golgi network, whereas GlcNAc6ST-2 is more broadly distributed, with a strong representation in the earlier parts of the Golgi. A chimera comprising the catalytic domain of GlcNAc6ST-2 fused to the cytosolic tail, transmembrane domain, and stem of GlcNAc6ST-1 possessed the substrate preference and localization characteristic of GlcNAc6ST-1. These observations suggest that the N-terminal region of the enzymes dictates their substrate preference, either indirectly via altered Golgi distribution or by a more direct mechanism. In this work, we sought to identify the features of the N-terminal region of GlcNAc6ST-1 and -2 that might confer their unique properties. Inspection of their primary sequences reveals an extended stem region in GlcNAc6ST-1 that is absent in GlcNAc6ST-2 (Fig. 1A). We therefore focused on the role of the stem domain in both the localization and substrate preferences of the enzymes. Using a panel of truncation mutants, we determined that perturbations to the stem region affect substrate preference without altering Golgi retention. We also discovered that GlcNAc6ST-1 exists as a disulfide-bound homodimer, mediated primarily by a Cys residue within the stem region, whereas GlcNAc6ST-2 is monomeric. Disruption of GlcNAc6ST-1 dimerization did not affect substrate preference or Golgi localization. Analysis of a chimera in which the stem of GlcNAc6ST-1 was inserted into the sequence for GlcNAc6ST-2 revealed a direct role for the stem region in governing substrate preference.

Generation of Sulfotransferase-EYFP, CTS-ECFP, and the 2,1 Stem Chimera—The constructs encoding GlcNAc6ST-1 or -2 fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) have been reported previously (17de Graffenried C.L. Bertozzi C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40282-40295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the CTS domain of GlcNAc6ST-1, corresponding to amino acids 1-114, was amplified by PCR, and then cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector. The gene fragment was excised from the TOPO vector using restriction sites for enzymes NheI and KpnI that were included in the PCR primers. The excised sequence was then ligated into EYFP-NI or ECFP-NI (Clontech), which had been digested with NheI and KpnI. The -75 variant of GlcNAc6ST-2 was created using a megaprimer PCR method adapted from Skrincosky et al. (23Skrincosky D. Kain R. El Battari A. Exner M. Kerjaschki D. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22695-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Using the CTS-ECFP construct as a template, the gene encoding the N-terminal region of GlcNAc6ST-1 (comprising the cytosolic tail, transmembrane domain, and ∼12 lumenal amino acids) was amplified by PCR using a 3′ primer that contained 21 bp of 5′ non-annealing sequence corresponding to the first seven codons of the GlcNAc6ST-1 catalytic domain (DKRQLVY). This megaprimer was gel-purified, and then used in a subsequent round of PCR with a template corresponding to only the catalytic domain of GlcNAc6ST-1. The product of this reaction was inserted into pCR4Blunt TOPO, excised with NheI and KpnI, and cloned into EYFP-NI. The -30 GlcNAc6ST-1 construct was generated by digesting the parental GlcNAc6ST-1-EYFP plasmid with SfoI, creating a fragment containing bp 172-803. The remainder of this digestion, comprising bp 1-171 and 990-1458 of GlcNAc6ST-1, was used to amplify DNA corresponding to the tail and transmembrane domain of the enzyme with a 3′ primer containing 21 bp of 5′ non-annealing sequence corresponding to His69 to Arg76 (HARLDLR) of the same enzyme. The product of this PCR was gel-purified and used in a subsequent PCR with the 172-803 fragment as a template and a 3′ primer that included a unique SbfI site in the GlcNAc6ST-1 sequence. This PCR product was cloned into pCR4Blunt TOPO and excised using NheI and SbfI. The parental GlcNAc6ST-1-EYFP plasmid was digested with the same restriction enzymes, followed by ligation of the TOPO fragment. The 2,1 stem-EYFP construct was generated by three rounds of megaprimer PCR. GlcNAc6ST-2-EYFP was used to amplify the sequence corresponding to amino acids 1-39 using a 5′ primer containing 21 bp of non-annealing sequence, which encoded the first 7 amino acids in the GlcNAc6ST-1 stem (NPDGPLG). This product was used in another PCR employing GlcNAc6ST-1-EYFP as the template and a 5′ primer containing the 5′ non-annealing sequence corresponding to the first 7 amino acids in the catalytic domain of GlcNAc6ST-2 (PERMHVL). After gel purification, this DNA fragment was used as the 3′ primer in a final round of PCR with GlcNAc6ST-2-EYFP as the template. The final PCR product was cloned into pCR4Blunt TOPO, excised with NheI and KpnI, and ligated into EYFP-NI that had been digested with the same enzymes. All constructs were verified with DNA sequencing. Generation of the Cys Mutants of GlcNAc6ST-1—The two Cys residues in the CTS-EYFP construct (C12 and C39) were mutated to Ser individually using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis. The double Cys mutant was constructed by subjecting the C12S mutant to a subsequent round of QuikChange. The full-length variant of GlcNAc6ST-1 with both Cys residues mutated to Ser was generated using megaprimer PCR using the C12S/C39S CTS-EYFP construct as a template. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—The sulfotransferase-EYFP plasmids were linearized using AseI, then transfected into HeLa cells. After 48 h of transfection, 400 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) was added to the media to select for stable integrants. After 3 weeks of selection, the population of resistant cells was autocloned using a cell sorter, with the fluorescent protein signal used for gating. Individual clones were expanded and used without further subcloning. Flow Cytometry—Cells (2 × 106) were seeded in a 10-cm dish 24 h prior to transfection. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were lifted with trypsin/EDTA and then replated. After another 24 h, the cells were lifted with 1 mm EDTA in PBS, washed twice with buffer A (0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS), and counted. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on 500,000 cells. All antibodies were used at a concentration of 1 μg/106 cells except for the G72 hybridoma supernatant, which was used at a 1/10 dilution. The primary antibody was applied in 50 μl of buffer A and incubated with the cells on ice for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with buffer A and then incubated in 50 μl of diluted secondary reagent for 30 min. The cells were washed twice and incubated with streptavidin-tricolor conjugate. The cells were analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Small Molecule Inhibitors of Glycosylation—Cells were plated at ∼300,000 cells per well in a 12-well dish. Swainsonine (Sigma) was added to the media at a concentration of 10 μm, whereas α-benzyl GalNAc (Sigma) was used at 4 mm. The cells were grown in the presence of the inhibitors for 2 days and were then processed for flow cytometry as above. Western Blots—Approximately 6 × 106 cells in a 10-cm dish were washed twice with PBS, then lifted with 0.6 mm EDTA in PBS lacking calcium and magnesium. The cells were washed with PBS and then resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl) containing 1 tablet of Complete protease inhibitors (Roche), supplemented with 1 μm pepstatin. After a 1-h incubation on ice, the lysates were clarified at 2500 × g for 5 min. The total protein content of each sample was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. An aliquot (9 μg) of each lysate was treated with either denaturing loading buffer (0.1 m DTT added) or the same buffer lacking DTT and then boiled for 8 min. The samples were loaded onto a 5-15% gradient gel, and analyzed by Western blot on a nitrocellulose membrane probed with rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal sera (Molecular Probes), followed by goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The blot was developed using SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce) and Kodak film. Microscopy—Cells were seeded on slides mounted with tissue culture wells (LAB-TEK) and allowed to adhere for 2 days. The cells were washed 3 times with PBS, then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After three washes, the cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were blocked in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min, followed by the addition of the first antibody diluted in blocking buffer. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed 3 times, blocked for 10 min, and incubated with the secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h. After 3 washes, the cells were mounted using Vectashield with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). A Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope equipped with a 63 × 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat oil immersion lens was employed for imaging. A 175 W xenon lamp housed in a Sutter DG4 illuminator linked to the microscope by an optical fiber assured shuttering and illumination. Image stacks containing 50 to 60 sections spaced 0.3-μm apart were acquired using a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific). Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Solutions) was used to control the microscope and the camera. The image stacks were digitally deconvolved using the nearest neighbor algorithm of Slidebook. Localization and Substrate Preferences of GlcNAc6ST-1-EYFP and Stem Deletion Mutants—Previous studies with glycosyltransferases have implicated their stem regions, in some cases, as determinants of Golgi localization (24Gleeson P.A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 517-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Dahdal R.Y. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26310-26319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7784-7793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several of these studies exploited mutants in which the stem region was completely or partially deleted. We adopted a similar approach in our investigation of the stem region of GlcNAc6ST-1. Based on sequence alignment of the GlcNAc/GalNAc/Gal-6 sulfotransferase family, we define the stem domain as the 75-residue sequence spanning Asn40-Gly114 (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, the stem region of GlcNAc6ST-2 is defined as the short sequence His25-Pro40. The deletion mutants generated for this study lack residues 40-69 (termed -30) or all 75 residues of the stem (termed -75) (shown in Fig. 1A and schematically in Fig. 1B). For the partial deletion mutant (-30), we chose to eliminate the portion of the stem closest to the transmembrane domain based on previous studies with glycosyltransferases that identified the transmembrane-proximal residues as most important for Golgi localization (25Dahdal R.Y. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26310-26319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7784-7793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that the region we define as the stem domain does not include ∼12 residues that are predicted to extend into the Golgi lumen, immediately adjacent to the transmembrane domain. In preliminary studies, we found mutants lacking these additional residues to be misfolded and accumulate in the ER (data not shown). To study the subcellular localization of the mutants, as well as their cellular substrate preference, we fused EYFP to their C-termini and generated stably transfected HeLa cell lines. Our previous work made extensive use of fluorescent protein-GlcNAc6ST-1 and -2 chimeras (17de Graffenried C.L. Bertozzi C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40282-40295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and we confirmed in that study that such modifications of the C terminus do not affect either Golgi localization or substrate preference in stably transfected cells. We performed fluorescence colocalization experiments with full-length GlcNAc6ST-1-EYFP and the two deletion mutants (-30 and -75) along with the known Golgi marker TGN46 (27Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. James J. Lister J.M. Ponnambalam S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 238-246PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, all three proteins were localized to the Golgi, suggesting that the -30 and -75 deletions do not grossly affect cellular distribution. To determine the preferred substrates of the GlcNAc6ST variants, we utilized antibodies specific for sulfated glycans and glycosylation inhibitors. The antibodies used in this study were monoclonal antibodies G72 and MECA-79; their epitopes are shown in Fig. 3 in the context of a biantennary O-linked glycan that has been identified as a physiological L-selectin ligand (22Yeh J.C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Ellies L.G. Rabuka D. Hindsgaul O. Marth J.D. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9953-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The minimal epitope recognized by G72 is GlcNAc-6-sulfated sialyl N-acetyllactosamine (Siaα2,3-Galβ1,4(SO3-6)GlcNAc) (4Mitsuoka C. Kannagi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11225-11233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 18Kimura N. Mitsuoka C. Kanamori A. Hiraiwa N. Uchimura K. Muramatsu T. Tamatani T. Kansas G.S. Kannagi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4530-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Its affinity is increased by the addition of a fucose residue to generate 6-sulfo sLex (highlighted in green in Fig. 3), which can be accomplished by expression of FucTVII (17de Graffenried C.L. Bertozzi C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40282-40295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This epitope can be found as a capping structure on either N- or O-linked glycans. MECA-79 recognizes a GlcNAc-6-sulfated core structure elaborated from the Core 1 Gal residue found only on O-linked glycans (Galβ1,4(SO3-6)GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,3GalNAc, highlighted in blue in Fig. 3) (22Yeh J.C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Ellies L.G. Rabuka D. Hindsgaul O. Marth J.D. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Cell. 2001; 105: 957-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of the MECA-79 epitope requires expression of a Core 1 GlcNAc transferase termed Core1-β3GlcNAcT (22Yeh J.C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Ellies L.G. Rabuka D. Hindsgaul O. Marth J.D. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Cell. 2001; 105: 957-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The G72 epitope can be elaborated from the MECA-79 epitope on the lower branch in Fig. 3. The same epitope can be generated on the upper branch as well, provided that a Core 2 GlcNAc transferase (Core2GlcNAcT-I) is expressed. HeLa cells express Core2GlcNAcT-I (30Yeh J.C. Ong E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), whereas Core1-β3GlcNAcT must be introduced by transfection. We analyzed HeLa cells stably expressing full-length GlcNAc6ST-1-EYFP, -30 or -75 by flow cytometry using G72 (columns 1 and 2) and MECA-79 (column 3) (Fig. 4A). Cells expressing the full-length enzyme or the -30 variant showed significant immunoreactivity with G72 (column 1), which was increased by transient transfection of FucTVII (column 2). By contrast, the -75 variant did not express detectable G72 epitope in the presence or absence of FucTVII. HeLa cells expressing any of the three GlcNAc6ST-1-EYFP variants showed similar immunoreactivity with MECA-79 (column 3). We confirmed that all cell lines used in this study expressed comparable levels of sulfotransferase-EYFP proteins by Western blot with an anti-GFP antibody (not shown). These results indicate that the full-length and -30 variants have comparable activity on a similar spectrum of substrates. Both can generate the capping structure recognized by G72 and the more internal structure detected by MECA-79. By contrast, the -75 variant can generate the MECA-79 epitope at a level comparable with the other two variants but fails to produce the G72-reactive structure. We sought to determine the distribution of products generated by full-length GlcNAc6ST-1-EYFP and the -30 variant among the N- and O-linked glycan subclasses. Toward this end, we probed the effects of glycosylation inhibitors on the immunoreactivity of stably transfected HeLa cells. α-Benzyl GalNAc truncates O-linked glycans selectively by intercepting the enzymes that elaborate the core GalNAc residue (31Kuan S.F. Byrd J.C. Basbaum C. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19271-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Swainsonine selectively blocks N-linked glycan maturation by inhibiting processing enzymes (32Elbein A.D. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 16: 21-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, G72 binding to cells expressing either full-length GlcNAc6ST-1-EYFP or the -30 variant was partially diminished by either inhibitor and reduced to near background levels by simultaneous treatment with both. This result suggests that GlcNAc6ST-1-EYFP and the -30 variant can similarly modify both N- and O-linked glycans. The Stem Region of GlcNAc6ST-1 Is a Determinant of Substrate Preference—The -75 deletion mutant of GlcNAc6ST-1 is reminiscent of GlcNAc6ST-2 with respect to both overall architecture and substrate preference. As we reported previously, GlcNAc6ST-2 prefers to sulfate the core region of O-linked glycans, generating the MECA-79 epitope more efficiently than the G72 epitope (17de Graffenried C.L. Bertozzi C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40282-40295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that the stem region, absent in the -75 variant, may confer activity on capping structures such as that detected by G72. To address this, we inserted the stem domain from GlcNAc6ST-1 into the corresponding region of GlcNAc6ST-2 (shown schematically in Fig. 5A), fused the C terminus to EYFP, and analyzed the localization and activity of the chimera (termed “2,1 stem”) in stably transfected HeLa cells. Fluorescence microscopy analysis confirmed that the chimeric sulfotransferase was localized to the Golgi compartment similarly to the wild-type protein (GlcNAc6ST-2-EYFP) and the Golgi marker TGN46 (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5C, the chimera was capable of generating the G72 epitope, unlike native GlcNAc6ST-2-EYFP. Indeed, the activity of the chimera was similar to that of the enzyme from which its stem was derived, GlcNAc6ST-1. These observations suggest that the stem plays a major role in dictating the spectrum of substrates modified by the sulfotransferase. Dimerization of GlcNAc6ST-1-EYFP—Western blot analyses of GlcNAc6ST-2-EYFP and the -30 and -75 mutants revealed the presence of immunoreactive species with molecular weights corresponding to homod"
https://openalex.org/W1973929091,"We have previously described a 3.5-Mb domain of enhance scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR) at a human neocentromere, and normal expression of underlying genes within this region. We also reported that partial inhibition of histone deacetylation using 33 nmtrichostatin A (TSA) resulted in a shift in the position of the CENP-A-binding domain within the neocentromere, with no noticeable effects on mitotic segregation function. In this study, 33 nm TSA caused a reduction in the size of the enhanced S/MAR domain of one-half to 1.7 Mb. Treatment with a DNA-intercalating drug distamycin A (DST) at 75 μg/ml resulted in a size reduction of the enhanced S/MAR domain at the neocentromere of two-thirds to 1.2 Mb, and that of the CENP-A-binding domain of 40%, from 330 to 196 kb, with no significant shift in the position of the latter domain. Other DST effects include mitotic chromosomal missegregation, reduction in the levels of Topo IIα, CENP-A, CENP-C, and HP1α, and an increase in mitotic checkpoint protein BubR1. TSA or DST treatment similarly resulted in a significant reduction, by ∼20 and 50%, respectively, in the size of the enhanced S/MAR domain at the α-satellite DNA of a native chromosome 10 centromere. Transcriptional competence within the neocentromere is overall not noticeably altered by either TSA or DST treatment, as is evident from the absence of any significant increase or decrease in the expression levels of 47 underlying genes tested. These results suggest that a substantial contraction of the S/MAR domain may not be deleterious to centromere function, that disruption of the S/MAR domain directly affects the binding properties of a host of scaffold/matrix and centromeric/pericentric proteins, and that the overall competence and regulation of transcription at the neocentromeric chromatin is similar to those found at the corresponding normal genomic sites.

The centromere of the eukaryotes is essential for the proper segregation of replicated sister chromatids during cell division. It appears as the primary constriction on condensed chromosomes and is the point of microtubule spindle attachment. Most eukaryotic centromeres are comprised of tandemly repetitive satellite DNA (1Clarke L. Carbon J. Nature. 1980; 287: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 2Jabs E.W. Goble C.A.

Neocentromeres arise at previously non-centromeric loci in the genome and form active kinetochores that are functionally equivalent to the satellite DNA-based centromeres, both in terms of mitotic stability and association with centromere proteins (5Saffery R.

The eukaryotic genome is organized into higher order chromatin domains consisting of euchromatin and heterochromatin.

Chromatin in the eukaryotic genome has also been shown to be organized into loops that attach to a protein-rich chromosomal scaffold/matrix mediated by AT-rich DNA sequences termed scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) (15Berezney R. Coffey D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 1410-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 16Mirkovitch J. Mirault M.E.

A. 2002; 99: 15393-15397Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Centromeric α-satellite DNA is packaged more tightly than other genomic DNA, with a higher frequency of S/MARs (18Bode J.

Chromosoma. 1996; 105: 122-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Centromeric scaffold/matrix attachment has been shown to be sequence-independent, with the domain of increased S/MARs being mapped and shown to fully encompass the centromere-specific histone H3-related kinetochore protein domain of CENP-A on two human neocentromeres (21Saffery R.

Craig J.M. Sibson M. Choo K.H.A. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, scaffold/matrix attachment of telomere sequences has also been shown to be epigenetic (23de Lange T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Chromosome condensation by scaffold/matrix attachment can be inhibited by the minor groove DNA-binding drug distamycin A (DST). In Drosophila, DST inhibits centromeric condensation at metaphase (24Dolfini S.F. Razzini A.B. Experimentia. 1983; 39: 1402-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), preventing the activity of topoisomerase II, the major component of the chromosome scaffold/matrix (25Kas E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In mouse cells, DST reduces condensation of centromeric heterochromatin (26Radic M.Z. Lundgren K. Hamkalo B.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 1101-1108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), by competing with centromeric repeat elements for binding sites of chromosomal proteins (27Radic M.Z. Saghbini M. Elton T.S. Reeves R. Hamkalo B.A. Chromosoma. 1992; 101: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Tolstonog G.V. Wang X. Shoeman R. Traub P. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 647-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In human cells, DST has also been shown to inhibit the condensation of heterochromatic and centromeric regions on metaphase chromosomes (29Prantera G. Pimpinelli S. Rocchi A. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1979; 23: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30Mehta R. Guntur R.M. Ghosh R. Ghosh P.K. Indian J. Exp. Biol. 1990; 28: 106-110PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the drug has been shown to inhibit S/MAR elements within genes, altering their expression (31Romig H. Ruff J. Fackelmayer F.O. Patil M.S. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Zaffaroni N. Lualdi S. Villa R. Bellarosa D. Cermele C. Felicetti P. Rossi C. Orlandi L. Daidone M.G. Eur. J. Cancer. 2002; 38: 1792-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have begun a systematic dissection of the chromatin structure and the effects chromatin-modification drugs on the previously reported 10q25 neocentromere of the human marker chromosome mardel (10) (6Voullaire L.E. Slater H.R. Petrovic V. Choo K.H.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 52: 1153-1163PubMed Google Scholar, 33du Sart D. Cancilla M.R. Earle E. Mao J.I. Saffery R. Tainton K.M. Kalitsis P. Martyn J. Barry A.E.

Genet. 1999; 8: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This neocentromere has been extensively characterized, and the localization of several important centromeric chromatin domains have been mapped along its DNA base, including a 330-kb CENP-A-binding domain and a 1-Mb region of delayed replication timing (35Lo A.W. Craig J.M. Saffery R. Kalitsis P. Irvine D.V. Earle E. Magliano D.J. Choo K.H.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2087-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). More recently, the distribution of the various domains corresponding to enriched S/MARs, centromere protein CENP-H, and heterochromatin protein HP1, as well as the expression status of endogenous gene loci within and flanking the 10q25 neocentromere, have been determined (21Saffery R.

In addition, we have described the effects of TSA-induced histone hyperacetylation that resulted in a unilateral shift (by ∼320 kb) in the position of the CENP-A-associated domain and an apparent expansion in the size of this domain to ∼480 kb (7Craig J.M. Wong L.H. Lo A.W. Earle E. Choo K.H.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we further investigate the effects of TSA-induced histone hyper-acetylation and DST-induced disruption of scaffold/matrix attachment on the organization of the chromosomal scaffold/matrix domain on the functional integrity and underlying gene expression properties of the neocentromere. Cell Culture and Drug Treatment—CHO-human somatic cell hybrids containing the mardel (10) chromosome (M10) and normal chromosome 10 (N10) were cultured as previously described (21Saffery R. Sumer H. Hassan S. Wong L.H. Craig J.M. Todokoro K. Anderson M. Stafford A. Choo K.H.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 33 nm trichostatin A (Calbiochem) for 17 h or 75 μg/ml distamycin A (SERVA) for 72 h before harvesting for analysis. Genomic BAC Array Production—BAC clones were obtained from the human genomic library RPCI-11 (36Osoegawa K. Mammoser A.G. Wu C. Frengen E. Zeng C. Catanese J.J. de Jong P.J. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and DNA was isolated using standard techniques. 100 ng of BAC DNA was immobilized onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes in a dot blot format (minifold SRC-96, Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany). Nuclei and S/MAR DNA Isolation—S/MAR array analysis was performed as previously described (21Saffery R. Sumer H. Hassan S. Wong L.H. Craig J.M. Todokoro K. Anderson M. Stafford A. Choo K.H.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Sumer H. Craig J.M. Sibson M. Choo K.H.A. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 2 × 108 cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation and the pellets washed in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at 500 × g. The pellet was resuspended and washed three times for 5 min at 500 × g in isolation buffer containing 3.75 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05 mm spermine, 0.125 mm spermidine, 1% (v/v) thiodyglycol (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland), 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm EDTA/KOH, pH 7.4, and 10 kIU/ml aprotinin. The pellet of washed cells was resuspended in 12 ml of ice-cold isolation buffer containing 0.1% digitonin and 100 kIU/ml aprotinin, and broken up in a Dounce-type tissue homogenizer with 12 strokes of a B (loose) pestle. The nuclei were collected by three washes in isolation buffer containing 0.1% digitonin and 10 kIU/ml aprotinin at 900 × g, 10 min at 4 °C. The washed pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of isolation buffer containing 0.1% digitonin, 100 kIU/ml aprotinin, and without EDTA/KOH. Nuclei were then filtered through a 40-micron filter (BD Biosciences) using gravity to remove nuclei clumps. 1 × 106 nuclei in 100 μl of isolation buffer with 0.1% digitonin, 100 kIU/ml aprotinin, and without EDTA/KOH were stabilized at 37 °C for 20 min. The nuclei were then diluted with 1 ml of LIS buffer consisting of 5 mm Hepes/NaOH, 0.25 mm spermidine, 2 mm EDTA/KOH, 2 mm KCl, and 50 mm 3,5-diiodasalicylic acid, lithium salt (LIS) (SERVA), and left to extract for 10 min at 4 °C. The extracted nuclei were centrifuged at 2,400 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then washed four times with 8 ml of digestion buffer. Digestion buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05 mm spermine, 0.125 mm spermidine, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.1% digitonin, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and 100 kIU/ml aprotinin. Restriction enzymes (EcoRI, EcoRV, and BamHI) were then added at 1,000 units/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. The nuclear scaffold-attached DNA was pelleted from the digested loop DNA by centrifugation at 2,400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Each fraction was treated with RNase for 30 min and proteinase K for 4 h and DNA extracted using standard phenol:chloroform extraction. S/MAR Array Analysis—Identical genomic array blots were preannealed with 5 μg of salmon sperm DNA and probed with 1 μg of scaffold-attached or loop DNA from the mardel (10) and control cell lines, radioactivity labeled by random priming according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science), and pre-annealed with 5 μg of human Cot-1 DNA. Hybridization and washes were performed at high stringency (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 65 °C). All blots were exposed to a Kodak PhosphorImager screen and were analyzed using the PhosphorImager system (Storm 860 Gel and Blot Imaging System, Molecular Dynamics) connected to an IBM-compatible computer controlled by Image QuaNT version 4.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). The signal obtained from each scaffold-attached DNA spot on the dot blot BAC array was compared with that on a duplicate blot hybridized with the loop DNA. Scaffold/matrix attachment for each BAC for both test and control cell lines was calculated as the percentage difference between the scaffold/matrix-attached/unattached signal ratio of mardel (10)-containing cell line and normal chromosome 10-containing cell lines (i.e.{[normal – marker]/normal} × 100). The data were represented graphically by plotting the average and standard deviation of the mean on the midpoint for each BAC/PAC on the array. A two-tailed Student's t test was performed on the results for each BAC/PAC to establish statistical significance. Southern Blot Analysis—Five micrograms of DNA corresponding to total, pellet (S/MAR), and supernatant (loop) fractions were isolated from control and treated cells, electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Nylon membranes were prehybridized at 65 °C for 4 h. Probes were radioactively labeled by the Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science), and hybridization was performed at 65 °C for 18 h. Filters were washed at 65 °C twice in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Blots were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and analyzed using the PhosphorImager system. Band intensities were quantified using Image QuaNT version 4.2 software. S/MAR strength values were calculated as described by Strissel et al. (20Strissel P.L. Espinosa III, R. Rowley J.D. Swift H. Chromosoma. 1996; 105: 122-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), relative strength (R) is the band intensity of the pellet S/MAR fraction divided by the sum of intensities of the pellet (S/MAR) and supernatant (loop) fraction (i.e. [{S/MAR}/{S/MAR + loop}] × 100). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Array Analysis—ChIP array analysis using affinity-purified CENP-A was performed as previously described (35Lo A.W. Craig J.M. Saffery R. Kalitsis P. Irvine D.V. Earle E. Magliano D.J. Choo K.H.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2087-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 37Lo A.W. Magliano D.J. Sibson M.C. Kalitsis P. Craig J.M. Choo K.H.A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were harvested and resuspended in TBS (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2 with 0.1 mm PMSF and proteinase inhibitors (Complete, protein-ase inhibitor mixture tablet, Roche Applied Science) with 0.25% Tween 20 and incubated at 4 °C on a roller stirrer for 2 h. The suspension was homogenized to extract the nuclei using 30 strokes of the “Tight” pestle on a Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton). The nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C (Sorvall RT-7). Nuclei were resuspended in 25% sucrose in TBS and carefully layered onto a 50% sucrose in TBS layer and centrifuged at 2,500 rpm at 4 °C to separate cytoplasmic debris through the discontinuous sucrose gradient. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in Digestion buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm CaCl2 with 0.1 mm PMSF) to 500 ng/μl (obtained by measuring A260nm). Aliquots of nuclei were subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion at a concentration of 80 units/mg DNA at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by chilling on ice and adding a 1:100 volume of 0.5 m EDTA. The preparation was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C (Biofuge fresco, Heraeus). The supernatant containing mainly mononucleosomes was separated and kept on ice. The pellet fraction was further processed by incubation with lysis buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, and a proteinase inhibitor tablet in a 50-ml volume) on ice for 1 h. The sample was vortexed, and the supernatant containing oligonucleosomes was obtained after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The two supernatants were pooled and precleared by incubation with an equal volume of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for at least 4 h. The samples were then centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to isolate the supernatant. The supernatant was stored at –20 °Cor used immediately for immunoprecipitation. An equal volume of oligonucleosomes was mixed with incubation buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, and a proteinase inhibitor tablet per 50 mls). Affinity-purified CENP-A antibody was added at a 1:500 dilution and incubated on a rolling stirrer at 4 °C overnight. The immune complex was then captured by incubation at 4 °C with 12.5% protein A-Sepharose that had been washed in incubation buffer for 2 h. After incubation the protein A-Sepharose was washed stepwise in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA) containing 50, 100, and 150 mm NaCl. The immune complex was then eluted twice with 1% SDS. The “bound” DNA was extracted from the eluted fraction as described above. Duplicate BAC arrays were probed with 1 μg of radioactivity labeled “input” or “bound” DNA from the patient and control cell lines. The signal obtained from each bound DNA spot on the dot blot BAC array was compared with that on a duplicate blot hybridized with the input DNA. First, normalization was performed with each value by dividing the signal from an outlying BAC bA313D6, and the ratio for each spot of “bound” compared with “input” obtained. The ratio of enhancement of the bound/input (R) of the patient cell line was compared with a control cell line, i.e.{[Test (R) – control (R)]/control (R)} × 100. The data were represented graphically by plotting the average and standard error of the mean on the midpoint for each BAC on the array. A two-tailed Student's t test was performed on the results for each BAC to establish statistical significance. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed as described (21Saffery R. Sumer H. Hassan S. Wong L.H. Craig J.M. Todokoro K. Anderson M. Stafford A. Choo K.H.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Primers for PCR amplification were designed using primer express software (ABI). All primer pairs were designed so that at least one of the pair spanned a genomic exon/intron boundary to avoid the amplification of contaminating genomic DNA or total RNA, and no amplification was detected from human genomic DNA or total RNA prior to reverse transcription as described in Saffery et al. (21Saffery R. Sumer H. Hassan S. Wong L.H. Craig J.M. Todokoro K. Anderson M. Stafford A. Choo K.H.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using SYBR green technology with the Applied Biosystems SYBR green master mix, and reactions were performed on an ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System. ΔCT analysis was used to calculate the relative amount of expression of individual genes in relation to an 18 S rRNA control amplicon (Ambion Inc.). ΔCT for each dilution was then calculated, and if efficiencies of amplifications were comparable, this value did not change significantly with each dilution. For TAQman-based quantitative RTPCR, Assay On Demand preoptimized primer and probe mix were employed with TAQman master mix and TAQman 18 S rRNA control reagents (Applied Biosystems). Mitotic Block and Release—Fibroblasts cells were grown on Super-Frost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser, Braunschweig, Germany) in Quadriperm (Vivascience, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia) slide chambers. Once cells had adhered, nocodazole to a final concentration of 100 nm was added and incubated overnight to block cells in mitosis. Cells were released from mitosis by removing media, washing twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and adding fresh medium containing 10 μm cytochalasin B for 1 h to block cytokinesis. Immunofluorescence—Cells incubated in colcemid for 1 h were spun onto microscope slides using a cytospin centrifuge (Shandon) at 1000 rpm for 10 min. Slides were permeabilized in KCM (120 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm NaEDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) for 10 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in KCM and incubated on slides for 1 h at 37 °C. Slides were washed three times in KCM, and fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in KCM (according to the supplier's instructions) were incubated on slides for 1 h at 37 °C. Antibodies were then washed off the slides in KCM, fixed in 10% formalin, and then mounted in DAPI (2 μg/ml) in Vectashield antifade mountant (Vector Laboratories). Antibodies used in this study include polyclonal anti-human BubR1 (38Jablonski S.A. Chan G.K. Cooke C.A. Earnshaw W.C. Yen T.J.

Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (FISH) Analysis—Cells incubated in colcemid for 1 h were dropped onto microscope slides in 3:1 methanol: acetic acid. Slides were dehydrated by sequential emersion in 75, 95, and 100% ethanol for 5 min, and air-dried at room temperature. Slides were then immersed in 70% formamide in SSC (83 °C) for 4 min followed by sequential emersion in 75, 95, and 100% ice-cold ethanol. Slides were then air-dried again at room temperature. 200 ng of BAC (bA153G5) probe labeled by nick translation with biotin-16-dUTP and pre-annealed with Cot-1 DNA (Roche Applied Science) were hybridized to slides at high stringency (50% formamide at 37 °C) overnight. Slides were then washed three times in 0.1× SSC at 60 °C. Hybridization was detected by dual-layer detection using avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-avidin. Chromosomes were counterstained using DAPI in Vectashield. Slides were examined on a Zeiss Axiioplan II fluorescence microscope with a 100× oil objective and the appropriate filters. Images were captured with a cooled charge-coupled device video camera (SenSys 2), connected to a PowerMac G4 computer controlled by IP Lab version 2.5.5 software (Scanalytics). Quantification of fluorescence signal was performed as described essentially as described in Ref. 42Cimini D. Mattiuzzo M. Torosantucci L. Degrassi F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3821-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar. The best in-focus image of centromeres was determined visually, and a region corresponding to the centromere was measured for the mean fluorescence intensity minus background fluorescence using IP Lab software. The average of antibody fluorescence was calculated for at least 100 centromeres, and results compared using a Student's t test.
