https://openalex.org/W1507147440,"Abstract A novel type of glycopeptides comprising approximately 10% of the total protein-bound neuraminic acid in developing rat brain have been isolated and characterized. The glycopeptides displayed unique properties including precipitation with cetylpyridinium chloride, strong binding to anion exchange column, and large apparent size in gel filtration. Structural studies including methylation analysis, as well as gel filtration experiments with native and desialylated glycopeptides, suggested that they were composed of a core similar to that of normal tri- and tetraantennary N-glycosidic glycopeptides, with outer branches of the general structure (NeuAc alpha 2-8)nNeuAc alpha 2-3Gal--. The total number of sialic acid residues varied from 8 to at least 12. Similar glycopeptides were not observed in liver or kidney of the young rat or in the brain of the adult animal. These observations suggest that the polysialosylated glycopeptides represent a class of developmentally regulated carbohydrate structures characteristic of developing brain tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1593306904,"Two enzymes involved in oleic acid biosynthesis have been purified from immature safflower seed. The stearoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) desaturase which catalyzes the formation of the double bond of oleate has been purified 200-fold and is a dimer with a molecular weight of 68,000. The enzyme shows strong preference for stearoyl-ACP as substrate; by comparison of its activity with stearoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-ACP as substrates, it appears that the ACP moiety is primarily important for binding of substrate and the chain length is important for catalytic activity. The desaturase requires 56 microM oxygen for half-maximal activity, 400 microM oxygen for maximal activity, and is stimulated severalfold by catalase. The acyl-ACP thioesterase has been purified 700-fold and is also a dimer of molecular weight 74,000. It shows a 5-fold preference for oleoyl-ACP versus stearoyl-ACP and is relatively inactive with corresponding acyl-CoAs."
https://openalex.org/W1558631717,"DNA fragments of defined sequence were used to study DNA strand breakage by gamma radiation in doses ranging from 2,500 to 20,000 rads. The amount of radiation-induced DNA breakage is linearly dose-dependent, and strand scission events occur uniformly at all nucleotide sites, regardless of sequence. The 5'-terminal group at points of breakage is a simple phosphoryl moiety. Two types of radiation-induced 3' termini were identified. One species of 3' terminus is a simple phosphoryl group. The other species of 3' terminus is neither a hydroxyl nor a phosphoryl group. A model for radiation-induced DNA strand scission that involves destruction of the deoxyribose moiety is presented. Similarities among DNA strand scission events created by gamma radiation, ferrous ion, doxorubicin, and bleomycin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1580742681,"Secretory component (SC), a glycoprotein associated with polymeric IgA and IgM in external secretions, is produced by certain epithelial cells and is thought to be the receptor mediating the transepithelial transport of these immunoglobulins. We studied the biosynthesis of human SC in a cloned cell line (HT29.E10) derived from a colon adenocarcinoma. In both cell-free translations and pulse labeling of cells, SC is made as a larger precursor (Mr = 95,000). This precursor is a transmembrane protein, as a large fragment (Mr = 80,000), is protected by the membrane from proteolytic digestion. Both this membrane-protected fragment and the undigested precursor have the same NH2-terminal sequence as mature SC. These data indicate that SC is proteolytically cleaved from the NH2-terminal, ectoplasmic (noncytoplasmic) domain of the precursor. This conclusion is supported by pulse-chase experiments. The Mr = 95,000 form is first converted to a Mr = 100,000 form by addition of peripheral sugars. The Mr = 100,000 form is then slowly cleaved to a Mr = 80,000 form which is gradually released into the medium. We propose that the transmembrane precursor of SC is the receptor involved in transepithelial transport of polymeric immunoglobulins."
https://openalex.org/W1592323860,"The activity of the copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase decreased with increasing ionic strength. Modification of lysine residues by acetylation or succinylation inverted the effect of increasing ionic strength, whereas modification of arginine with phenylglyoxal did not. These results were noted in both photochemical and pulse-radiolysis assays. It appears that interaction of O2- with the anionic enzyme is assisted by the positive charge on lysine residues, presumably those close to the active site. By the criterion of responsiveness to ionic strength, the arginine residue close to the active site does not appear to provide electrostatic facilitation to the catalytic process. Elimination of the charge on epsilon-amino groups by raising the pH suppressed activity to the same extent as did elimination of these charges by acetylation. Activity was similarly suppressed to the same extent by covalent modification or by ionization of arginine residues, indicating that the positive charge on arginine is important for the catalytic process even though its effect is not responsive to changes in the ionic strength of the solution."
https://openalex.org/W1526513913,"The ability of mitochondria to take up and retain Ca2+, and thereby to effect the free intracellular concentration of this ion, is well established. More recently, it has been reported (Lehninger, A. L., Vercesi, A., and Bababunmi, E. A. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 1690-1696) that the redox state of pyridine nucleotides modulates mitochondrial Ca2+ balance, since the oxidation of mitochondrial NAD(P)H is associated with the release of Ca2+ from these organelles. The latter may be achieved by a variety of treatments including the incubation of Ca2+-loaded liver mitochondria with hydroperoxides, the metabolism of which by the glutathione peroxidase-glutathione reductase system results in NADPH consumption. The metabolism of menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) by Ca2+-loaded rat liver mitochondria results in rapid oxidation and loss of pyridine nucleotides and a decrease in ATP level. It is also associated with Ca2+ release and an impaired ability of the mitochondria to take up and retain Ca2+. The effects of menadione on mitochondrial Ca2+ balance are more rapid and pronounced than those of t-butylhydroperoxide, and in contrast to those observed with the hydroperoxide, they are not abolished by pretreatment with a glutathione-depleting agent. The effects of menadione on Ca2+ homeostasis are probably initiated by NAD(P)H oxidation linked to the reduction of menadione by both NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and NAD(P)H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase."
https://openalex.org/W1595784941,"Elevation of the incubation temperature of Chinook salmon embryo cells from 20 to 24 degrees C or exposure to heavy metals such as CdCl2 (5 microM) or ZnCl2 (100 to 500 microM) induces the reversible expression of a set of heat shock or stress proteins. Continuous exposure of the cells to either metal ions or heat shock results in recovery of protein synthesis to a control-like pattern. Treatment of these cells with either ZnCl2 or CdCl2 also induces the protein metallothionein. Heat shock, however, does not induce metallothionein, suggesting that it does not belong to the common group of heat shock or stress proteins. The induction of these stress proteins can be inhibited by pretreatment with actinomycin D, suggesting that their expression is regulated at the transcriptional level. The major stress proteins are detectable in the products of an in vitro translation system programmed with RNA isolated from heat shock- or metal ion-treated cells. A recombinant DNA probe complementary to Drosophila mRNA coding for the 70,000-dalton heat shock protein was found to hybridize to RNA isolated from heat shock-or metal ion-treated cells but not from control cells. The fish mRNA coding for the heat shock protein with a molecular weight of 70,000 appears to be of similar size to the corresponding Drosophila mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1549084754,"The control of intracellular proteolysis by amino acids was investigated in rat livers perfused in the single pass mode with various mixtures at multiples of normal plasma concentrations. Twelve amino acids together exhibited no suppressive activity while the remainder (Leu, Phe, Tyr, Gln, Pro, His, Trp, and Met) were inhibitory. Because (a) the effects of phenylalanine and tyrosine were equal and nonadditive, and (b) the former is rapidly converted to the latter, tyrosine rather than phenylalanine was considered to be an active regulator. The inhibitory group, minus phenylalanine, duplicated responses of the complete mixture between 0 and 4 times (4x) normal plasma levels. When tested individually, leucine was the strongest inhibitor, suppressing deprivation-accelerated proteolysis by 63% at 4x and 10x. However, at lower concentrations its effects differed dramatically from those of the regulatory mixture in showing a sharp modal loss of responsiveness at approximately 1x, a finding which suggests that proteolytic regulation at normal levels is achieved largely by the remaining 6 amino acids. Leucine responses from 1x to 4x (0.2 to 0.8 mM) were mimicked by equimolar additions of alpha-ketoisocaproate. The fact that 0.8 mM alpha-ketoisocaproate increased intracellular leucine by only 7.8% of the value obtained with equimolar (4x) leucine supports observations of others that transamination limits interconversion between leucine and its alpha-ketoacid to 4-10% of total alpha-ketoisocaproate utilization at this level. We conclude that the effects of leucine and alpha-ketoisocaproate on hepatic proteolysis are mediated by separate pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1541090747,"Brominated poly(dG-dC) . poly(dG-dC), which forms a stable Z-DNA helix under physiological salt conditions, was used as an antigen to produce monoclonal antibodies from mice. The anti-Z-DNA antibodies were specific for the Z conformation as was shown by direct binding studies and a competitive solid phase assay. Competition could only be seen by brominated poly(dG-dC) . poly(dG-dC) under low and high salt conditions and unmodified poly(dG-dC) . poly(dG-dC) under high salt conditions. No binding could be seen to a number of other polynucleotides, including native and denatured DNA. Among the anti-Z-DNA monoclonal antibodies, examples differed in specificity: binding of one monoclonal antibody was blocked by methylation of cytosine; whereas the other antibody reacted equally well with the unmodified polymer or methyl cytosine-containing polymer in high ionic strength. The two antibodies are specific for different localized features of Z-DNA structure."
https://openalex.org/W1524627078,"Adult rat hepatocytes placed in primary culture contain at least two distinct Na+-independent transport systems for neutral amino acids. The characteristics of the two systems do not allow assignment to previously described Na+ independent agencies, so we have tentatively termed the two processes Systems L1 and L2. Uptake by System L1 is substantially inhibited by cysteine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid. In contrast, System L2-mediated transport is completely inhibited by isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, and 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid. Amino acids transported by both systems show biphasic kinetics yielding Km values for the System L1 component in the micromolar range, whereas the corresponding values for System L2 are an order of magnitude higher. In freshly isolated hepatocytes, the activity of System L2 is relatively high and declines over the initial 24 to 48 h of culture. The Na+-dependent Systems N and ASC also show a significant decay in activity during this time period. In contrast to the decrease in uptake by System L2, transport by System L1 increases during culture following an initial lag period of 12 to 24 h. The increase in System L1 activity can be blocked by the addition of either cycloheximide or actinomycin D. System L1 appears to be present also in fetal hepatocytes, although, in the hepatoma cell line, HTC, the Na+-independent component appears to be homogeneous as though one of the two systems present in the normal adult hepatocyte is not expressed in these transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1547267125,"The holes in hemoglobin-free ghosts generated by osmotic lysis of human erythrocytes have been characterized. The efflux from ghosts of water-soluble probes with a Stokes radius of 5,.2 to 61 hi was measured, The kinetics was usually first order, suggesting a homogeneous ghost population, but became complex because of sieving when hole and probe were approximately the same size. The area of exit per ghost, calculated from Fick's law of diffusion, varied widely but the number of holes per ghost, calculated from the sieving of pairs of probes, was always unity. The hole had a circular rather than elliptical shape and a path length of 60 A, approximately the thickness of the membrane. Ghosts were induced to partially seal so as to trap various probe molecules at diffusional equilibrium. The sustained retention of probes ruled out the possibility that the holes are impermanent, intermittent breaches in membrane continuity. The dispersion of hole size under a given set of conditions was fairly narrow. Centrifugation on density barriers composed of appropriate solutes separated ghosts populations into fractions with holes larger than the solute (which pelleted) and smaller (which floated). The fractional floatation of ghost populations on barriers of dextran, sucrose, mannitol, and CsCl was calibrated with estimates of their hole radii obtained from efflux kinetics to establish a rapid, simple, and precise technique for estimation of mean ghost hole size. The average difference between the hole radius measured by density barrier and equilibrium trapping methods was 4 & 8 S.D. A. Holes could be reduced at high ionic strength to 7 hi in radius and ilated at very low ionic strength to >lo4 b (1 pm), at which point they became visible in the dark-field microscope as a single round 1esion.The hemolytic hole is thus a continuously-tunable molecular filter, the area of which can be modulated over more than a million-fold in a defined fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1571407241,"The single ligand-binding site of bovine myoglobin carbonyl exists in four discrete conformations as shown by four C--O stretch bands for the carbonyl ligand. Both this infrared spectrum and the visible spectrum are altered by changes in pH from 4.7 to 8.2 at 20 degrees C. The spectral changes can be related to monoprotonation or monodeprotonation at a protein residue with a pKa = 6.0 +/- 0.2. Below pH 5.5, an additional proton-coupled infrared spectral change is evident. Histidine is an appropriate site for pKa approximately 6; there are 13 histidines in the protein. However, the nature of the pH effects on infrared spectra indicates that neither the proximal nor the distal histidine is a likely site. The state of protonation of the protein has a marked effect on the relative stabilities of the four conformers but appears to have little effect on the discrete conformer structures per se in that C--O stretch band frequencies and shapes are nearly insensitive to changes in pH. The sum of the four integrated infrared band intensities is similarly insensitive. These findings provide strong support for the presence of four conformers of significantly different structure at the heme ligand-binding site and for rapid interconversions among these structures."
https://openalex.org/W1488142233,"Carbon 13 NMR, radiotracer and mass spectrometry studies were performed to confirm that propionate and methylmalonate are incorporated into long chain branched hydrocarbons as the methyl branch unit, to determine whether the branching methyl group was added initially or toward the end of the elongation process, to determine the precursor of methylmalonate, and to examine the metabolism of propionate in the housefly, Musca domestica. The labeled carbons from [3-13C]propionate and [methyl-13C]methylmalonate were incorporated into the branching methyl carbon of the methylalkanes, and into the even numbered carbons in alkanes and alkenes. The labeled carbons from [2-13C]propionate and [1-13C]propionate labeled the tertiary carbon and the carbon adjacent to the teritary carbon, respectively, in the methylalkanes. Mass spectral analysis of the methylalkanes after enrichment from [1-13C]propionate showed that propionate was incorporated during the initial stages of chain synthesis of the terminally branched alkanes. Sodium [2-13C]propionate labeled the odd numbered carbons of both the alkanes and alkenes. These data suggest that propionate is converted to an acetyl derivative, with carbon 3 of propionate converted to the carboxyl carbon of acetate, and carbon 2 of propionate converted to the methyl carbon of acetate. This pathway of propionate metabolism has hitherto only been reported in plants. The labeled carbons from DL-[3,4,5-13C3]valine were incorporated intact (as determined by 13C--13C coupling) into the branching methyl carbon, tertiary carbon, and carbon adjacent to the tertiary carbon, respectively, demonstrating that valine serves as a precursor to the methylmalonate used in branched alkane biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1560831298,"Link proteins, isolated from proteoglycan aggregates prepared from human articular cartilage, were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. When subjected to the former technique the native link proteins resolve into three components of molecular weights 48,000, 44,000, and 41,000. Link protein, isolated following clostripain digestion of proteoglycan aggregate, is present as a single component of molecular weight 41,000. Under all conditions of isoelectric focusing tested, the native link proteins resolve into at least nine subcomponents having pI values between 6.0 and 7.0. The clostripain-treated link protein resolves into at least five subcomponents which have pI values similar to those of the more basic subcomponents observed in the native molecules. One source of heterogeneity contributing to both isoelectric focusing profiles is variation in sialic acid content, since neuraminidase treatment of the link protein preparations produces a shift to subcomponents with more basic pI. The electrophoretic data are consistent with the two larger link protein components representing the same protein core, but being substituted to different degrees with oligosaccharide chains that may have variable sialic acid contents. The smallest link protein component, which may be derived from either of the larger moieties by limited proteolytic cleavage, is also substituted with sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1501454916,"Arachidonic acid and other fatty acids are taken up by human platelets from plasma and incorporated into membrane phospholipids. However, little is known about the mechanism and specificity of the various steps of fatty acid insertion into phospholipid. Previous findings from this laboratory have shown that the incorporation of radioactive C20-unsaturated fatty acids (arachidonic, 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic, and 5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic) into the phospholipids of restingp platelets is more rapid than that of the radioactive C16- and C18-saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. We now provide evidence that human platelet microsomes contain acyl-CoA:1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine acyltransferase. The enzyme preparation has a pH optimum of 7.0. Activity is insensitive to 1 mM EDTA and is inhibited 37% by 1 mM Ca2+ and 20% by 1 mM Mg2+. Maximal activity is observed at 100 microM 1-acyl lysophosphatidylcholine at several concentrations of fatty acyl-CoA esters. Apparent Km values from 1.05 to 5.70 microM were obtained for saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl group donors in the presence of 100 microM 1-acyl lysophosphatidylcholine as fatty acyl group acceptor. Comparison of the apparent Vmax values showed that unsaturated CoA esters were transferred more rapidly to 1-acyl lysophosphatidylcholine than saturated CoA esters. Oleate, linoleate, and arachidonate, the major unsaturated fatty acids in platelet phosphatidylcholine, were transferred at similar rates. 8,11,14-eicosatrienoate was transferred about two times faster than these three fatty acyl groups. The data indicate that the incorporation of unsaturated fatty acids into phosphatidylcholine by human platelets occurs via reacylation of 1-acyl lysophosphatidylcholine."

https://openalex.org/W1562607404,"A large scale purification procedure for the human platelet factor 4 proteoglycan carrier molecule has been developed. A yield of 46% and a 33,000-fold purification have been achieved, using poly-L-lysine-Sepharose affinity column chromatography, PF4-agarose affinity column chromatography, and Bio-Gel A-0.5m gel filtration. The purified proteoglycan migrates as a single band during electrophoresis on cellulose acetate strips. A single symmetric peak was observed in sedimentation velocity analysis with an s value of 2.85. The molecular weight of the proteoglycan was determined to be 53,000 by sedimentation equilibrium. The purified proteoglycan contains 32% uronic acid, 31% galactosamine, 6.1% sulfate, and 9.9% protein. Aspartic acid, glutamic acid, leucine, glycine, and serine account for 55% of the total amino acids. The chondroitinase AC digest of the proteoglycan is sensitive to hydrolysis by chondro-4-sulfatase but not by chondro-6-sulfatase, indicating the presence of chondroitin 4-sulfate but not chondroitin 6-sulfate in the proteoglycan molecule. The interaction between this proteoglycan carrier of human PF4 and PF4 is strongly ionic strength-dependent. 0.3 M NaCl is required to dissociate the proteoglycan PF4 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1492377313,"Using estrogen-induced chick liver cells which synthesize and secrete large amounts of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), we have previously shown (Siuta-Mangano, P., Howard, S., Lennarz, W. J., and Lane, M. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4292-4300) that the major protein constituent of VLDL, the 350,000 molecular weight apoprotein (apoprotein B), is synthesized as a single polypeptide to which core oligosaccharides are added co-translationally. This system has now been employed to study the assembly of the apoproteins of VLDL with their glycerolipid (triglyceride and phospholipid) components and the secretion of the VLDL glycerolipids. In the presence of cycloheximide such that VLDL apoprotein synthesis is inhibited 98%, the secretion of lipids labeled from a [3H]palmitate pulse by hepatocyte monolayers was halted only after completed apoprotein chains had cleared the cell. Under conditions whereby tunicamycin inhibited [3H]glucosamine incorporation into apoprotein B by 98% and [3H]leucine incorporation into the VLDL apoproteins minimally, the unglycosylated form of apoprotein B assembled with the usual complement of triglyceride and phospholipid as did glycosylated apoprotein B to form a VLDL which was readily secreted by the hepatocyte. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that whereas apoprotein synthesis is necessary for the secretion of the major lipid components of VLDL, glycosylation of apoprotein B is not required for either the assembly of VLDL glycerolipids or for the secretion of the VLDL particle."
https://openalex.org/W1603758362,"Detailed studies of the effects of the ionophore monensin upon avian chondrocyte ultrastructure, macromolecular synthesis, and macromolecular secretion have been carried out. Embryonic avian chondrocytes in suspension culture were incubated in concentrations of monensin ranging from 1 X 10(-7) to 1 X 10(-6) M for durations up to 8 h. Electron microscopy revealed that the treated chondrocytes developed abnormal Golgi structures and a markedly distended rough endoplasmic reticulum. Biochemical and immunoassay studies showed that while total protein synthesis was only slightly impaired by monensin, the ionophore had pronounced effects upon the secretion of both type II collagen and proteoglycans. These two macromolecules responded to monensin inhibition in a similar fashion and accumulated within the affected chondrocytes. The kinetics of response over the monensin concentration range used was virtually identical for type II collagen and proteoglycan. Undersulfation of proteoglycan, caused by monensin, was examined by ion exchange chromatography and analysis of the products of chondroitinase ABC digestion. The results indicated that undersulfation affected all glycosaminoglycan chains in a general fashion rather than affecting a specific population of chains."
https://openalex.org/W1563406908,"Rapid kinetic techniques were employed to measure the transport of uridine and thymidine in human erythrocytes in zero-trans entry and exist and equilibrium exchange procedures. The kinetic parameters of transport were computed by fitting appropriate integrated rate equations to time courses of transmembrane equilibration of radiolabeled substrate. Transport of uridine and thymidine conformed to the simple carrier model with directional symmetry, but differential mobility of loaded and empty carrier. As was apparent from comparison of zero-trans influx and equilibrium exchange flux, the loaded carrier moved 3 to 18 times faster than the empty carrier in batches of erythrocytes obtained from different individuals. The maximum equilibrium exchange velocities also differed for different batches of erythrocytes. Storage of the cells at 4 degrees C for 4 days or treatment of cells with oxidizing or reducing agents or suspension in hypotonic solutions had no effect on the kinetic properties of the nucleoside transporter. All natural ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides tested when present on the trans side at concentrations well above the Michaelis-Menten constant for transport accelerated the influx and efflux of uridine and inhibited uridine influx when present at these concentrations on the cis side, but nucleobases had no significant effect."
https://openalex.org/W1607049869,"Characteristic intranuclear inclusion bodies have been isolated from the kidney cortex of lead-intoxicated rats. A protein has been identified which appears to be unique to the inclusion bodies. It was not detected in kidney or liver from normal rats, suggesting that it is induced by lead. However, sequestration of an extant protein by lead remains a possibility. The protein has an apparent molecular weight of 32,000 and an isoelectric point of 6.3. Although traces of related proteins were identified by 125I-tryptic peptide maps, these may be artifacts because they do not occur in some preparations. Identification of this protein provides an opportunity to characterize the molecular interactions between lead and the inclusion bodies. It has been suggested that the inclusion bodies have a protective effect in lead-intoxicated animals. The induction or sequestration of a unique protein lends support to this proposal."
https://openalex.org/W1528055239,"During the action of pancreatic lipase and colipase on racemic 1,2-didodecanoylglycerol monolayers in the absence of bile salts, biphasic kinetics was observed under conditions of high lipid packing. Similar kinetics has earlier been reported using phospholipid-emulsified triolein droplets (Borgstrom, B. (1980) Gastroenterology 78, 954-962). These kinetics are characterized by a lag time tau d, dependent on products accumulation at the substrate/water interface. This lag time is differentiated from the previously described enzyme concentration independent lag time tau i in systems of low lipid packing (Verger, R., Mieras, M. C. E., and de Haas, G. H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4023-4034). Both tau i and tau d reflect a rate-limiting step due to the slow enzyme penetration into the substrate interface. The variation of tau d under different conditions (change in pH and concentration of Ca2+, enzyme, bovine serum albumin, and lipolytic products) lead us to propose a model for the product activation during lipolysis. We will discuss the use of the pancreatic lipase-colipase system to probe the lipid packing of emulsified triglyceride particles and lipoproteins using tau d as a reference value."
https://openalex.org/W2122545969,"The calf uterine estrogen receptor showed positive cooperativity of [3H]estradiol equilibrium binding; the Scatchard plot was convex and the Hill coefficient was 1.69 +/- 0.021 (n = 14). The effects of the estrogenic antagonists, zuclomiphene (cis-2-(p-[2-chloro-1,2-diphenylvinyl]phenoxy)triethylamine citrate) and enclomiphene (trans-23-(p-[2-chloro-1,2-diphenylvinyl]phenoxy)triethylamine citrate), on the positive cooperativity of [3H]estradiol binding were measured by titrating the receptor with a variable concentration of [3H]estradiol and antagonist while maintaining a constant excess in a specific ratio of the antagonist to the [3H]estradiol. With a 45- to 55-fold molar excess of zuclomiphene or an 820- to 900-fold molar excess of enclomiphene above the [3H]estradiol concentration, the receptor's positive cooperative [3H]estradiol binding was inhibited. A transition from a convex to a linear Scatchard plot and a decrease in the Hill coefficient from 1.69 to 1.10 +/- 0.02 (n = 6) were induced. The specifically bound [3H]estradiol was inhibited 43 to 50% by the zuclomiphene and enclomiphene. The addition of unlabeled estradiol in a 1- or 2.3-fold molar excess above that of the [3H]estradiol concentration produced a 50 to 75% competitive displacement of the specifically bound [3H]estradiol; nevertheless, the Scatchard plot remained convex and the Hill coefficient was 1.74 and 1.80, respectively. Thus, inhibition of the positive cooperativity of [3H]estradiol binding by the clomiphene isomers was not due to dilution of the specifically bound [3H]estradiol by the antagonist. These data demonstrate that there are two molecular mechanisms by which an estrogen antagonist interferes with the function of the receptor: as a competitor, thus blocking the estrogen receptor's binding site to an agonist, and second by inducing conformational changes that inhibit site:site interactions and receptor activation."

J. 874 are blue, epsilon 595-850 approximately 2.6 +/- 0.5 (n = 6) mM-1 cm-1. Iron and zinc were the only metals detected by x-ray fluorescence of an enzyme preparation and the mean content in different preparation as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy was 0.95 +/- 0.17 (n = 6) and 0.68 +/- 0.27 (n = 7) mol/mol 150-kilodalton tetramer, respectively. It is yet unclear if zinc is a contaminant or may be given a structural role. Results with iron chelators and reductants showed that the 595-nm absorbance is linked to enzyme-bound Fe3+ and that reduction of iron, which occurs concomitantly with disappearance of the color, is required for enzyme activity. The enol tautomer of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate appeared to form 2:1 a complex with enzyme-bound Fe3+, which may be the cause of the long known substrate inhibition of the enzyme. Iron chelation also seemed to be involved in the inhibition by other substrate analogues, i.e. substituted catechols and those with one phenolic hydroxyl group in ortho position to short carboxylic acid side chains. Together, substrate analogue, pH, and modification studies indicated that the tautomerizable keto group with a double bond in 3-4 position favors productive substrate binding to Fe2+ and a base with a pK alpha of approximately 6.4."

The reconstituted troponin complex (AGC labeled CM-TnI, TnT, and TnC) was photolyzed and separated using DEAE-Sephadex chromatography in the presence of 8 M urea and absence of reducing agent. Radioactivity measurements indicated that 12% of the cross-linker reacted with solvent and 88% with protein. The percentage of radiolabel found in TnI, TnI-TnT, and TnI-TnC complexes was 35, 55, and 10%, respectively. These results have shown that both TnT and TnC are within 14 A of one or both cysteines 48 and 64 of TnI. Of the total radiolabel found in TnT, 33 and 23% was found in the two cyanogen bromide fragments, CB4 (residues 176-230) and CB2 (residues 71-151). The most likely interpretation of the cross-linking results is that one of the interaction sites between TnI and TnT is an ionic interaction involving the region around cysteines 48 and 64 of TnI (residues 28-82) with the CB5 region of TnT (residues 135-185)."
https://openalex.org/W1545031535,"Glycine, which contributes 2 carbon atoms and the nitrogen for the biosynthesis of homarine by homogenates of shrimp muscle, reacts metabolically with succinyl coenzyme A to form N-succinylglycine. The latter product is effectively converted by such homogenates to homarine, and it is concluded that N-succinylglycine is on the main pathway of this biosynthetic series of reactions and provides all of the required atoms in homarine, except for the N-methyl carbon. A possible pathway for the complete biosynthesis of homarine is described. Evidence is presented that homarine acts as a transmethylating agent in shrimp muscle homogenates and is capable of transferring its N-methyl group to form mono-, di-, and trimethylamines, trimethylamine oxide, choline, and betaine. In this process, homarine loses its groups to form picolinic acid, and, conversely, picolinic acid can be methylated to yield homarine. It is speculated that homarine is not only a methyl donor but may serve as a reservoir of groups in crustacea."
https://openalex.org/W1483822886,"Polypeptides involved in the binding of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligand alpha-bungarotoxin (Mr = 8,000) to neuronal membranes were identified by three independent methods: (i) 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin bound to membrane fractions or to monolayer cultures of chick retina was cross-linked to its binding site by using glutaraldehyde, or the photoactivatable bifunctional reagent N-succinimidyl-6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate. Electrophoretic analysis of the cross-linked membrane proteins revealed 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin-polypeptide adducts of apparent Mr = 63,000, 43,000, and 33,000. (ii) Affinity purification of the alpha-bungarotoxin binding protein from detergent extracts of [35S]methionine-labeled retina cultures identified one major polypeptide with an Mr = 57,000. (iii) Indirect immunoprecipitation from detergent extracts of [35S]methionine-labeled rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC 12) gave evidence for a specific co-precipitation of alpha-bungarotoxin with three polypeptides (Mr = 57,000, 34,000, and 25,000). The data suggest that polypeptides of Mr - 57,000, 35,000, and 25,000 (+/- 3,000) are located at or close to the alpha-bungarotoxin binding domain of the putative neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1507860518,"The relative translational efficiency of the two human alpha-globin mRNAs, alpha 1 and alpha 2, was measured in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. To differentiate the translational products of these two mRNAs which normally encode an identical alpha-globin protein product, we used reticulocyte mRNA from a recently described Chinese subject. In this subject, an electrophoretically distinct alpha-globin mutant is encoded at the alpha 2 locus and both the alpha 1- and alpha 2-globin genes are deleted from the homologous chromosome (--/alpha 125Pro alpha). As in normal controls, the concentration of alpha 2-globin mRNA exceeded alpha 1 by approximately 3-fold. However, alpha 1- and alpha 2-globin proteins were synthesized by this reticulocyte mRNA at equal rates. This data suggests that the equal expression of the two alpha-globin genes observed in human erythrocytes results from a balance between the 3-fold excess of alpha 2-globin mRNA and a 3-fold higher translational efficiency of alpha 1-globin mRNA. The disparate translational efficiencies of the two alpha-globin mRNAs may be determined by the divergent structure of their 3' noncoding regions."

https://openalex.org/W2143904716,"Mechanisms by which proteoglycan aggregates are retained within cartilage were studied using two approaches: mechanical fragmentation of cartilage and reassociation of proteoglycans within extracted cartilage. The extractability of proteoglycans from fresh bovine nasal cartilage with low ionic strength buffer was found to vary from 13 to 45% depending upon the degree of cartilage fragmentation. Forty per cent of those extracted from finely fragmented cartilage (5-20-mu diameter) were found to be in aggregates which contained link proteins. A method was developed to reintroduce proteoglycans, which had been extracted with guanidine hydrochloride, into cartilage from which they had been extracted. Stability of the newly formed associations was assessed by re-extraction with a guanidine hydrochloride gradient. Purified proteoglycans alone or reduced and alkylated proteoglycans formed associations which were disrupted with less than 2 M guanidine hydrochloride. Addition of link proteins resulted in associations which required 2-4 M guanidine hydrochloride to be re-extracted. Association of proteoglycans into Sepharose 4B particles gave extraction patterns similar to reassociation into extracted cartilage. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that proteoglycans are immobilized within cartilage through the formation of aggregates and suggest that retention is dependent upon the integrity of the collagen mesh."
https://openalex.org/W1521917773,"In the hemoglobin of the opossum, the alpha chains have different residues at positions E7 and E11 than do most other mammalian hemoglobins. In the opossum, the usual histidine at alpha E7 is replaced by glutamine, the valine at alpha E11 by isoleucine, and the hemoglobin is known to have a low oxygen affinity and a low Hill coefficient. Comparison of kinetic studies of opossum hemoglobin with normal human hemoglobin shows that alpha chains in Hb opossum, despite the lack of distal histidine, do not differ significantly in CO-combination rates in either the T or R states. These rates are much slower than the rates reported for Hb Zurich, the hemoglobin from Chironomus thumi thumi, or the monomeric components of glycera hemoglobin, all of which also have a different residue at E7. As compared with Hb A, the changes in ligand affinities in the T and R states are small and cannot account for the unusually high values of p50 for Hb opossum. The equilibrium and kinetic data indicate that the L = (T)/(R) is about 100 times higher for Hb opossum than for Hb A; CCO = KR/KT approximately equal to 0.014. The kinetic data on l'4 and l also indicate that the R leads to T equilibrium for Hb4(CO)4 and Hb4(CO)2 can be shifted in either direction by adding inositol hexaphosphate or by changing the pH."
https://openalex.org/W1580645918,"Using methyl methanethiosulfonate and other sulfhydryl group modification reagents we have studied the structure and function of sulfhydryl groups in rabbit liver cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase. From a tryptic digest of the enzyme, seven cysteine-containing peptides were isolated and sequenced. These peptides contained a total of 8 cysteine residues. There are no disulfide bonds in this enzyme. Of the eight sulfhydryl groups, four react with methyl methanethiosulfonate. Two sulfhydryl groups react rapidly with this reagent without altering enzyme catalytic activity. The remaining two sulfhydryl groups react more slowly and cause loss of greater than 90% of the catalytic activity of the enzyme. This nearly inactive enzyme contains pyridoxal-P and can form an enzyme-substrate complex. However, the complex dissociates from the active site suggesting that one possible role for a sulfhydryl group is to stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex. The sequence of the cysteine-containing peptide which is responsible for the mechanism-based inactivation of serine hydroxymethyltransferase by D-3-fluoroalanine was determined. This sulfhydryl group was shown not to be essential to the enzyme for catalytic activity. Also, the sequence of one of the cysteine peptides shows considerable homology to the active site cysteine peptide from tryptophan synthase."

The optical absorption spectrum of this intermediate is quite stable and very similar to that of horseradish peroxidase Compound II. The intermediate can be separated from small molecules by chromatography on a Sephadex G-10 column. After fractionation, 65 to 93% of 36Cl in the reaction mixture remains associated with horseradish peroxidase. The remainder of 36Cl-labeled enzyme reacts with 5,5-dimethyl-2-chloro-1,3-cyclohexanedione (monochlorodimedone) at pH 4 to transfer 36Cl from the enzyme to the halogen acceptor molecule. [36C]5,5-Dimethyl-2,2-dichloro-1,3-cyclohexanedione (dichlorodimedone) was established as the major product of the transfer reaction by co-crystallization of the enzymic product with authentic dichlorodimedone and by thin layer chromatography.

https://openalex.org/W1497772225,"Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) from rabbit back muscles can be readily subfractionated into two morphologically and compositionally different vesicular populations, SRH (heavy) and SRL (light) derived from terminal cisternae and longitudinal SR, respectively. Polyacrylamide gels indicate that SRH contains most of the calsequestrin. Quantitation of freeze-fractured isolated preparations reveals that, while differences in vesicular dimensions are seen in SRH and SRL, the intramembrane particle (Ca2+ ATPase) density is identical. Phospholipid headgroup composition is the same in SRH and SRL, but fatty acyl moieties show significant differences in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated phospholipids in the two fractions. The vesicular dimensions of the purified Ca2+-ATPases, SRHP and SRLP, from the two fractions are identical, but the freeze-fracture particle density is higher in the SRLP fraction. The phospholipid composition remains similar after purification, but the differences in phospholipid fatty acyl composition of the preparations are maintained. SRH and SRHP contain almost twice as much of the unsaturated species as compared to SRL and SRLP. Differences in intramembrane particle density in purified fractions, thermotropic segregation of particles in freeze-fractured purified fractions, as well as differences in turnover of the acyl phosphate, appear to reflect the differences in fatty acyl chain composition of the two SR fractions and provide evidence of microheterogeneity in lipid-protein environment of the SR."
https://openalex.org/W1568244671,"The binding of a 3H-labeled ethylenediamine derivative of tetrodotoxin ([3H]EN-TTX) and 125I-labeled polypeptide neurotoxins, purified from the sea anemone Anenomia sulcata (ATXII) and the scorpion Androctonus australis Hector (AaHII), was studied using axolemma-enriched membrane fractions. The membrane fractions were derived from a purified preparation of myelinated axons fractionated via a linear sucrose gradient in a zonal rotor. The specific activity of Na+K+ ATPase in the axolemma-enriched preparation, found in the 28-32% sucrose region of the density gradient, was 59.1 mumol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg of protein/h. As estimated by 3H-specific ouabain binding, this fraction contained 183.6 pmol of Na+K+ ATPase/mg of protein. The 28-32% region of the density gradient was most enriched in the binding capacity for all neurotoxins, while the stoichiometry of the binding activities varied throughout the density gradient. The maximal binding (Bmax) of [3H]EN-TTX was 1 pmol/mg; the dissociation constant (KD) of the neurotoxin for its receptor was 2 X 10(-10) M. The comparable values for ATXII were 3.2 pmol/mg and 1.5 X 10(-7) M, respectively, while AaHII had a Bmax of 0.08 pmol/mg and a KD of 3.3 X 10(-9) M. The relationship of the binding of these neurotoxins to that observed in other axonal plasma membrane preparations is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2096944517,"Both human serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) can acquire [3H]glycosphingolipids from glycosphingolipid-coated hydrophobic glass beads, but the process produces variable denaturation of LDL. However, endogenous LDL glycosphingolipid can be 3H-labeled by the galactose oxidase/NaB[3H]4 technique without structural modification. We have now demonstrated that 3H-labeled neutral glycosphingolipids can be reversibly exchanged under physiological conditions between HDL and LDL. Maximal exchange was achieved following 4 to 8 h of incubation at 37 degrees C when the ratio of HDL to LDL concentration was 1:1 by weight. Only a small fraction, 10-15%, of the total glycosphingolipid contents of both HDL and LDL was available for exchange, indicating that at least two separate pools of glycosphingolipid exist on the surface of lipoprotein particles. When lipoprotein-deficient serum was added, the amount of glycolipid exchanged was not stimulated significantly. The level of phosphoglyceride exchange was 2-fold greater, and that of neutral lipids 4-fold greater, than neutral glycosphingolipids. Based on this and on our previous observations, we propose that high density lipoprotein can be used to modify the glycosphingolipid content and thus the biological properties of membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1594489419,"A brain preparation, consisting of nuclei and perikarya, was able to bind tritium-labeled diguanosine tetraphosphate ([3H]Gp4G). The binding was linear with both time and amount of extract and apparently presented two dissociation constant values (KD) of 0.16 and 0.6 microM, respectively, as determined by equilibrium binding experiments. Inhibition of [3H]Gp4G specific binding by 50% at equilibrium was accomplished by cold Gp4G, guanosine 5'-tetraphosphate, diguanosine triphosphate, and GTP at 0.7, 2.8, 3.1, and 10 microM concentrations, respectively. Diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) at concentrations up to 100 microM did not affect the observed binding of [3H]Gp4G to brain. These results suggest that this binding is specific and requires the existence of 4 phosphates plus at least 1 guanosine residue in the molecule. The binding of Gp4G to brain increased with time of development reaching a plateau at about 20 days after birth. The data are discussed in relation to previous results on the binding of Ap4A to brain and to DNA polymerase-alpha (Grummt, F., Waltl, G., Jantzen, H-M., Hamprecht, K., Huebscher, U., and Kuenzle, C.

https://openalex.org/W1505037602,"The rat liver ribosomal protein L6 binds to 5 S and 5.8 S rRNAs, and to initiator and elongator tRNAs. Experiments were carried out to determine if the protein has separate domains for binding each of these nucleic acids. For that purpose, nucleic acid.L6 complexes were immobilized on Sepharose and their capacity to retain 32P-labeled nucleic acids was assessed. A 5 S rRNA.L6 affinity complex binds 5.8 S [32P]rRNA indicating that L6 has separate binding sites for 5 S and 5.8 S rRNAs. A 5 S rRNA.L6 affinity complex also binds [32P]tRNAPhe, and unlabeled 5.8 S rRNA does not compete with the radioactive tRNA for binding to L6, suggesting that the ribosomal protein has a third, distinct, nucleic acid-binding domain. To determine if L6 has separate sites for the binding of elongator and initiator tRNAs, tRNAPhe. L6 and tRNAfMet.L6 affinity columns were constructed. The tRNAPhe.L6 affinity complex binds [32P]tRNAfMet, and the tRNAfMet.L6 complex binds [32P]tRNAPhe, suggesting there are distinct sites on L6 for the interaction with initiator and elongator tRNAs; however, competition experiments imply that, while there are two sites for binding tRNAs to L6, the sites do not discriminate between initiator and elongator tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1532792286,"DPN-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is composed of three distinct types of subunits: alpha, beta, and gamma which have molecular weights of about 40,000 but differ in isoelectric points. The relationship of subunit diversity to function was probed by use of chemical modification. 3-Bromo-2-ketoglutarate, a substrate and affinity label for the active site of isocitrate dehydrogenase, was shown to cause significant modification of all types of subunits. The substrate affinity label, 3-ene-2-keto-glutarate, labels each of the subunits equally. Approximately equal labeling of subunits was also found upon modification by cyanate of an essential lysyl residue in the isocitrate binding site. When enzyme was inactivated by a carbodiimide in the presence of glycine ethyl ester, both glutamate and aspartate residues reacted, and labeling of each type of subunit occurred. These studies suggest that the structurally distinct subunits of DPN-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase are functionally similar and each type of subunit contains a substrate binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1652741149,"Proteins from pregnant rat uterine myometrium, previously incubated in the presence of (32P)orthophosphate, were analyzed by one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent autoradiography. Electrophoretic patterns of Coomassie blue-stained proteins in preterm and labor myometria were indistinguishable. However, radioactivity incorporated into tubulin in preterm myometrium was predominantly associated with the beta-subunit, whereas in labor, the alpha-subunit was labeled. Endogenous phosphorylated alpha- and beta-tubulins were clearly identified on two-dimensional gel electrophoretograms by apparent molecular weights, isoelectric points, co-migration with marker brain tubulin, and reactivity to specific antitubulin antibodies. The antibodies were incubated with nitrocellulose sheets onto which the myometrial proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the two-dimensional gels. The switching in phosphorylation of beta- to alpha-tubulin in the labor myometrium appears to be a manifestation of estrogen action. The labor-specific phosphorylation changes occurred in parallel with changes in serum estradiol/progesterone ratios. Indeed, estrogen administered to ovariectomized rats caused the appearance of phosphorylated alpha-tubulin, and this effect was inhibited by progesterone. Although the significance of tubulin phosphorylation is not currently understood, the switching in phosphorylation from beta- to alpha-tubulin under estrogen domination may help clarify the role of microtubule phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1503996419,"Platelets are able to stimulate an increase in two distinct activities, tissue factor (thromboplastin) and fibrinolytic inhibition, in human fibroblasts in vitro. A procedure has been developed which allows the purification of a platelet macromolecule which is able to stimulate both of these changes. Washed human platelets were homogenized, sonicated, and then centrifuged at 90,000 x g for 2 h. The resulting pellet was solubilized in 0.05 M sodium carbonate, pH 10.5, and chromatographed on Sephadex G-200, then on hydroxylapatite, resulting in a 135-fold purification and a 20% yield. When the purified material was further fractionated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, stimulatory activity for both tissue factor and fibrinolytic inhibition was found only in the 75,000-dalton region. The active material could be inactivated by mercaptoethanol with no change in its apparent molecular weight. It was readily inactivated by trypsin with the concomitant loss of the 75,000-dalton Coomassie-staining band. Assay of the purified material for carbohydrate was negative. After isoelectric focusing, the purified material had a major band at pH 5.8 which stimulated both tissue factor and fibrinolytic inhibition. Subcellular fractionation of platelet homogenates by sucrose density gradient centrifugation resulted in a 2-fold increase in stimulatory material in the granule/mitochondrial fraction. This platelet-derived protein may represent a physiologically important regulator for both cellular procoagulant and the net fibrinolytic activity of systemic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1507477003,"Radioactive lipoproteins in the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) density range were taken up by rat liver in vivo. The radioactivity became associated with an intracellular particle of d = 1.11 that did not correspond to lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, or plasma membrane as determined by marker enzyme distribution. Radioactive VLDL remnants could be released from these particles by passage through a hydraulic press, hypotonic shock, or sonication. The release of radioactivity from the particles by one of these methods became more complete with increasing time after injection. The injection of colchicine inhibited the breakdown of the VLDL triglyceride and cholesterol ester and caused an accumulation of radioactive material in the d = 1.11 particles. In contrast, injected chloroquine inhibited breakdown of VLDL triglyceride and cholesterol ester and caused an accumulation in lysosomes. We have concluded VLDL remnants are metabolized in liver by an endocytosis-lysosomal digestion pathway and that the d = 1.11 particles are endocytic vesicles. The existence of a releasable pool of VLDL within endocytic vesicles makes it possible to examine the internalized remnant."
https://openalex.org/W1495365401,"Bovine heart submitochondrial particle energy-linked NADH leads to NADP+ transhydrogenase also catalyzes transhydrogenation between NADPH and NADP+. The stereochemistry of hydride ion transfer in the NADH leads to NADP+ reaction involves the nicotinamide 4A locus of NADH and the 4B locus of NADPH. In this paper it is demonstrated that during NADPH leads to NADP+ transhydrogenation the NADP+ is reduced exclusively at the 4B locus and that oxidation of NADPH is predominately at the 4B locus. Reduction of [4-3H]NADP+ by NADPH yielded [4A-3H]NADPH as the only product. Oxidation of [4A-3H]NADPH by NADP+ resulted in the conversion of nearly 33% of the label into [4-3H]NADP+, whereas the oxidation of [4B-3H] NADPH yielded only about a 6.5% conversion. These data suggest that while a small portion of total energy-linked NADPH leads to NADP+ transhydrogenation results from the binding of NADPH at the NAD domain of the active site with hydride transfer to NADP+ bound at the NADP domain, most of the reaction occurs by a mechanism in which both substrates are bound sequentially at the NADP domain. It is proposed that NADPH leads to NADP+ transhydrogenation represents a partial reaction of NADH leads to NADP+ transhydrogenation which involves the participation of a reduced-enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1548559819,"We have studied the effects of phenylglyoxal and other related arginine-specific reagents on the mammary cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor. Our studies show that phenylglyoxal can inhibit the binding of [3H]dexamethasone to the steroid-free receptor and also displace the bound [3H]dexamethasone from the steroid-receptor complex. The kinetics of the binding reaction reveals that the inhibition of phenylglyoxal may be due to its ability to interact with the steroid binding site of the receptor. Similar data are also obtained with other arginine-modifying agents such as 1,2-cyclohexanedione. Thus, these studies suggest that arginine residues may be involved in the binding of glucocorticoids to mammary cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1594622795,"Reaction of the active site-directed sulfhydryl reagent methoxycarbonyl-CoA disulfide with malate thiokinase follows pseudo-first order kinetics and leads to a complete loss in enzyme activity as measured by the overall reaction. The rate of inactivation of enzyme in buffer alone shows a linear dependence on the methoxycarbonyl-CoA disulfide concentration. In the presence of the substrate phosphate or the substrate analog sulfate, the rate of enzyme inactivation displays a hyperbolic response with respect to methoxycarbonyl-CoA disulfide. Anions such as chloride and fluoride decrease the rate of enzyme inactivation. Low concentrations of succinyl-CoA protect the enzyme against inactivation, while L-malate protection of the enzyme is observed only in the absence of added sulfate. Protection of the enzyme by ATP can be attributed to phosphorylation of the enzyme and a decrease in reactivity of the phosphoenzyme relative to the native enzyme. Enzyme reacted with excess methoxycarbonyl-CoA disulfide, although inactive with respect to turnover, catalyzes ATP-ADP exchange at one-half the rate of the native enzyme. The inactive enzyme can be phosphorylated by ATP, but only to 50% the extent of native enzyme. Titration of the enzyme with methoxycarbonyl-CoA disulfide shows that the enzyme exhibits all-of-the-sites reactivity with respect to this reagent. A correlation of titration of the enzyme with methoxycarbonyl-CoA disulfide with the loss in phosphorylation site shows that reaction of methoxycarbonyl-CoA disulfide produces half-of-the-sites reactivity with respect to enzyme phosphorylation."

Nucleosomes were present in the purified satellite chromatin as verified by digestion with micrococcal nuclease and DNase I and by electron microscopy. Average nucleosome DNA repeat lengths of 186 +/- 7 and 193 +/- 5 base pairs were obtained through micrococcal nuclease digestion of the purified satellite chromatin and control chromatin, respectively; nucleosome spacer lengths were equally heterogeneous for the two chromatin samples. The distribution of Eco RI-produced chromatin fragments of different size in the satellite chromatin was the same as that calculated assuming random cleavage at each Eco RI site, consistent with the notion that nucleosomes do not have specific locations on the 1.715 g ml-1 satellite DNA. The purified satellite chromatin contained little non-histone protein, but did contain all five histones and all detectable histone sequence variants. Amounts of the core histones were identical in the satellite chromatin and the control chromatin, but the amount of histone H1 was 30% less in the satellite chromatin than in the control. Although the molar ratios for the major sequence variants of both histones H3 and H2A differed between kidney and thymus, the ratios were the same for satellite and control chromatin isolated from a single tissue."
