https://openalex.org/W3045971896,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the rapidly unfolding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic1,2. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary, ranging from asymptomatic infection to respiratory failure. The mechanisms that determine such variable outcomes remain unresolved. Here we investigated CD4+ T cells that are reactive against the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed healthy donors. We detected spike-reactive CD4+ T cells not only in 83% of patients with COVID-19 but also in 35% of healthy donors. Spike-reactive CD4+ T cells in healthy donors were primarily active against C-terminal epitopes in the spike protein, which show a higher homology to spike glycoproteins of human endemic coronaviruses, compared with N-terminal epitopes. Spike-protein-reactive T cell lines generated from SARS-CoV-2-naive healthy donors responded similarly to the C-terminal region of the spike proteins of the human endemic coronaviruses 229E and OC43, as well as that of SARS-CoV-2. This results indicate that spike-protein cross-reactive T cells are present, which were probably generated during previous encounters with endemic coronaviruses. The effect of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells on clinical outcomes remains to be determined in larger cohorts. However, the presence of spike-protein cross-reactive T cells in a considerable fraction of the general population may affect the dynamics of the current pandemic, and has important implications for the design and analysis of upcoming trials investigating COVID-19 vaccines. A study of patients with COVID-19 and healthy donors found CD4+ T cells that react to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human endemic coronaviruses; however, the effect of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells on clinical outcomes remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W3046218096,"The papain-like protease PLpro is an essential coronavirus enzyme that is required for processing viral polyproteins to generate a functional replicase complex and enable viral spread1,2. PLpro is also implicated in cleaving proteinaceous post-translational modifications on host proteins as an evasion mechanism against host antiviral immune responses3-5. Here we perform biochemical, structural and functional characterization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PLpro (SCoV2-PLpro) and outline differences with SARS-CoV PLpro (SCoV-PLpro) in regulation of host interferon and NF-κB pathways. SCoV2-PLpro and SCoV-PLpro share 83% sequence identity but exhibit different host substrate preferences; SCoV2-PLpro preferentially cleaves the ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein (ISG15), whereas SCoV-PLpro predominantly targets ubiquitin chains. The crystal structure of SCoV2-PLpro in complex with ISG15 reveals distinctive interactions with the amino-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of ISG15, highlighting the high affinity and specificity of these interactions. Furthermore, upon infection, SCoV2-PLpro contributes to the cleavage of ISG15 from interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF3) and attenuates type I interferon responses. Notably, inhibition of SCoV2-PLpro with GRL-0617 impairs the virus-induced cytopathogenic effect, maintains the antiviral interferon pathway and reduces viral replication in infected cells. These results highlight a potential dual therapeutic strategy in which targeting of SCoV2-PLpro can suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection and promote antiviral immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3045578670,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the spread of which has led to a pandemic. An effective preventive vaccine against this virus is urgently needed. As an essential step during infection, SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein to engage with the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells1,2. Here we show that a recombinant vaccine that comprises residues 319–545 of the RBD of the spike protein induces a potent functional antibody response in immunized mice, rabbits and non-human primates (Macaca mulatta) as early as 7 or 14 days after the injection of a single vaccine dose. The sera from the immunized animals blocked the binding of the RBD to ACE2, which is expressed on the cell surface, and neutralized infection with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Notably, vaccination also provided protection in non-human primates to an in vivo challenge with SARS-CoV-2. We found increased levels of RBD-specific antibodies in the sera of patients with COVID-19. We show that several immune pathways and CD4 T lymphocytes are involved in the induction of the vaccine antibody response. Our findings highlight the importance of the RBD domain in the design of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and provide a rationale for the development of a protective vaccine through the induction of antibodies against the RBD domain. A recombinant vaccine that targets the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 induces a potent antibody response in immunized mice, rabbits and non-human primates, and protects primates from infection with the virus."
https://openalex.org/W3045619116,"The majority of therapies that target individual proteins rely on specific activity-modulating interactions with the target protein-for example, enzyme inhibition or ligand blocking. However, several major classes of therapeutically relevant proteins have unknown or inaccessible activity profiles and so cannot be targeted by such strategies. Protein-degradation platforms such as proteolysis-targeting chimaeras (PROTACs)1,2 and others (for example, dTAGs3, Trim-Away4, chaperone-mediated autophagy targeting5 and SNIPERs6) have been developed for proteins that are typically difficult to target; however, these methods involve the manipulation of intracellular protein degradation machinery and are therefore fundamentally limited to proteins that contain cytosolic domains to which ligands can bind and recruit the requisite cellular components. Extracellular and membrane-associated proteins-the products of 40% of all protein-encoding genes7-are key agents in cancer, ageing-related diseases and autoimmune disorders8, and so a general strategy to selectively degrade these proteins has the potential to improve human health. Here we establish the targeted degradation of extracellular and membrane-associated proteins using conjugates that bind both a cell-surface lysosome-shuttling receptor and the extracellular domain of a target protein. These initial lysosome-targeting chimaeras, which we term LYTACs, consist of a small molecule or antibody fused to chemically synthesized glycopeptide ligands that are agonists of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR). We use LYTACs to develop a CRISPR interference screen that reveals the biochemical pathway for CI-M6PR-mediated cargo internalization in cell lines, and uncover the exocyst complex as a previously unidentified-but essential-component of this pathway. We demonstrate the scope of this platform through the degradation of therapeutically relevant proteins, including apolipoprotein E4, epidermal growth factor receptor, CD71 and programmed death-ligand 1. Our results establish a modular strategy for directing secreted and membrane proteins for lysosomal degradation, with broad implications for biochemical research and for therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3045715678,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has resulted in a pandemic1. The C5a complement factor and its receptor C5aR1 (also known as CD88) have a key role in the initiation and maintenance of several inflammatory responses by recruiting and activating neutrophils and monocytes1. Here we provide a longitudinal analysis of immune responses, including phenotypic analyses of immune cells and assessments of the soluble factors that are present in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients at various stages of COVID-19 severity, including those who were paucisymptomatic or had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The levels of soluble C5a were increased in proportion to the severity of COVID-19 and high expression levels of C5aR1 receptors were found in blood and pulmonary myeloid cells, which supports a role for the C5a-C5aR1 axis in the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Anti-C5aR1 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies prevented the C5a-mediated recruitment and activation of human myeloid cells, and inhibited acute lung injury in human C5aR1 knock-in mice. These results suggest that blockade of the C5a-C5aR1 axis could be used to limit the infiltration of myeloid cells in damaged organs and prevent the excessive lung inflammation and endothelialitis that are associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3045498347,"Somatic mutations in p53, which inactivate the tumour-suppressor function of p53 and often confer oncogenic gain-of-function properties, are very common in cancer1,2. Here we studied the effects of hotspot gain-of-function mutations in Trp53 (the gene that encodes p53 in mice) in mouse models of WNT-driven intestinal cancer caused by Csnk1a1 deletion3,4 or ApcMin mutation5. Cancer in these models is known to be facilitated by loss of p533,6. We found that mutant versions of p53 had contrasting effects in different segments of the gut: in the distal gut, mutant p53 had the expected oncogenic effect; however, in the proximal gut and in tumour organoids it had a pronounced tumour-suppressive effect. In the tumour-suppressive mode, mutant p53 eliminated dysplasia and tumorigenesis in Csnk1a1-deficient and ApcMin/+ mice, and promoted normal growth and differentiation of tumour organoids derived from these mice. In these settings, mutant p53 was more effective than wild-type p53 at inhibiting tumour formation. Mechanistically, the tumour-suppressive effects of mutant p53 were driven by disruption of the WNT pathway, through preventing the binding of TCF4 to chromatin. Notably, this tumour-suppressive effect was completely abolished by the gut microbiome. Moreover, a single metabolite derived from the gut microbiota—gallic acid—could reproduce the entire effect of the microbiome. Supplementing gut-sterilized p53-mutant mice and p53-mutant organoids with gallic acid reinstated the TCF4–chromatin interaction and the hyperactivation of WNT, thus conferring a malignant phenotype to the organoids and throughout the gut. Our study demonstrates the substantial plasticity of a cancer mutation and highlights the role of the microenvironment in determining its functional outcome. In two mouse models of intestinal cancer, mutant p53 has an oncogenic effect in the distal gut but a tumour-suppressive effect in the proximal gut, and these opposing properties are determined by the gut microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W3046013264,"Abstract DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are generic markers of regulatory DNA 1–5 and contain genetic variations associated with diseases and phenotypic traits 6–8 . We created high-resolution maps of DHSs from 733 human biosamples encompassing 438 cell and tissue types and states, and integrated these to delineate and numerically index approximately 3.6 million DHSs within the human genome sequence, providing a common coordinate system for regulatory DNA. Here we show that these maps highly resolve the cis -regulatory compartment of the human genome, which encodes unexpectedly diverse cell- and tissue-selective regulatory programs at very high density. These programs can be captured comprehensively by a simple vocabulary that enables the assignment to each DHS of a regulatory barcode that encapsulates its tissue manifestations, and global annotation of protein-coding and non-coding RNA genes in a manner orthogonal to gene expression. Finally, we show that sharply resolved DHSs markedly enhance the genetic association and heritability signals of diseases and traits. Rather than being confined to a small number of distal elements or promoters, we find that genetic signals converge on congruently regulated sets of DHSs that decorate entire gene bodies. Together, our results create a universal, extensible coordinate system and vocabulary for human regulatory DNA marked by DHSs, and provide a new global perspective on the architecture of human gene regulation."

https://openalex.org/W3045576138,"All metazoans depend on the consumption of O2 by the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) to produce energy. In addition, the OXPHOS uses O2 to produce reactive oxygen species that can drive cell adaptations1-4, a phenomenon that occurs in hypoxia4-8 and whose precise mechanism remains unknown. Ca2+ is the best known ion that acts as a second messenger9, yet the role ascribed to Na+ is to serve as a mere mediator of membrane potential10. Here we show that Na+ acts as a second messenger that regulates OXPHOS function and the production of reactive oxygen species by modulating the fluidity of the inner mitochondrial membrane. A conformational shift in mitochondrial complex I during acute hypoxia11 drives acidification of the matrix and the release of free Ca2+ from calcium phosphate (CaP) precipitates. The concomitant activation of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger promotes the import of Na+ into the matrix. Na+ interacts with phospholipids, reducing inner mitochondrial membrane fluidity and the mobility of free ubiquinone between complex II and complex III, but not inside supercomplexes. As a consequence, superoxide is produced at complex III. The inhibition of Na+ import through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is sufficient to block this pathway, preventing adaptation to hypoxia. These results reveal that Na+ controls OXPHOS function and redox signalling through an unexpected interaction with phospholipids, with profound consequences for cellular metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3046219647,"The ability of the skin to grow in response to stretching has been exploited in reconstructive surgery1. Although the response of epidermal cells to stretching has been studied in vitro2,3, it remains unclear how mechanical forces affect their behaviour in vivo. Here we develop a mouse model in which the consequences of stretching on skin epidermis can be studied at single-cell resolution. Using a multidisciplinary approach that combines clonal analysis with quantitative modelling and single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that stretching induces skin expansion by creating a transient bias in the renewal activity of epidermal stem cells, while a second subpopulation of basal progenitors remains committed to differentiation. Transcriptional and chromatin profiling identifies how cell states and gene-regulatory networks are modulated by stretching. Using pharmacological inhibitors and mouse mutants, we define the step-by-step mechanisms that control stretch-mediated tissue expansion at single-cell resolution in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3045805366,"During ontogeny, proliferating cells become restricted in their fate through the combined action of cell-type-specific transcription factors and ubiquitous epigenetic machinery, which recognizes universally available histone residues or nucleotides in a context-dependent manner1,2. The molecular functions of these regulators are generally well understood, but assigning direct developmental roles to them is hampered by complex mutant phenotypes that often emerge after gastrulation3,4. Single-cell RNA sequencing and analytical approaches have explored this highly conserved, dynamic period across numerous model organisms5–8, including mouse9–18. Here we advance these strategies using a combined zygotic perturbation and single-cell RNA-sequencing platform in which many mutant mouse embryos can be assayed simultaneously, recovering robust  morphological and transcriptional information across a panel of ten essential regulators. Deeper analysis of central Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1 and 2 components indicates substantial cooperativity, but distinguishes a dominant role for PRC2 in restricting the germline. Moreover, PRC mutant phenotypes emerge after gross epigenetic and transcriptional changes within the initial conceptus prior to gastrulation. Our experimental framework may eventually lead to a fully quantitative view of how cellular diversity emerges using an identical genetic template and from a single totipotent cell. An experimental and analytical pipeline is used to assess, at the single-cell level, complex transcriptional and morphological mutant phenotypes that occur in mouse embryos during gastrulation."
https://openalex.org/W3022244974,"Currently, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a big threat to global health. The rapid spread of the virus has created pandemic, and countries all over the world are struggling with a surge in COVID-19 infected cases. There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19: information on the disease is very limited and scattered even if it exists. This motivates the use of data integration, combining data from diverse sources and eliciting useful information with a unified view of them. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that integrates global data for real-time prediction of infection trajectory for multiple countries. Because the proposed model takes advantage of borrowing information across multiple countries, it outperforms an existing individual country-based model. As fully Bayesian way has been adopted, the model provides a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, a joint variable selection technique has been integrated into the proposed modeling scheme, which aimed to identify possible country-level risk factors for severe disease due to COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3045871871,"It is paramount to expand the knowledge base and minimize the consequences of the pandemic caused by the new Coronavirus (SARS-Cov2). Spain is among the most affected countries that declared a countrywide lockdown. An ecological study is presented herein, assessing the trends for incidence, mortality, hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit admissions, and recoveries per autonomous community in Spain. Trends were evaluated by the Joinpoint software. The timeframe employed was when the lockdown was declared on March 14, 2020. Daily percentage changes were also calculated, with CI = 95% and p<0.05. An increase was detected, followed by reduction, for the evaluated indicators in most of the communities. Approximately 18.33 days were required for the mortality rates to decrease. The highest mortality rate was verified in Madrid (118.89 per 100,000 inhabitants) and the lowest in Melilla (2.31). The highest daily percentage increase in mortality occurred in Catalonia. Decreasing trends were identified after approximately two weeks of the institution of the lockdown by the government. Immediately the lockdown was declared, an increase of up to 33.96% deaths per day was verified in Catalonia. In contrast, Ceuta and Melilla presented significantly lower rates because they were still at the early stages of the pandemic at the moment of lockdown. The findings presented herein emphasize the importance of early and assertive decision-making to contain the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3046125961,"There is a desperate need for safe and effective vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics for SARS– coronavirus 2 (CoV-2), the development of which will be aided by the discovery of potent and selective antibodies against relevant viral epitopes. Human phage display technology has revolutionized the process of identifying and optimizing antibodies, providing facile entry points for further applications. Herein, we use this technology to search for antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of CoV-2. Specifically, we screened a naïve human semisynthetic phage library against RBD, leading to the identification of a high-affinity single-chain fragment variable region (scFv). The scFv was further engineered into two other antibody formats (scFv-Fc and IgG1). All three antibody formats showed high binding specificity to CoV-2 RBD and the spike antigens in different assay systems. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated specific binding of the IgG1 format to cells expressing membrane-bound CoV-2 spike protein. Docking studies revealed that the scFv recognizes an epitope that partially overlaps with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–interacting sites on the CoV-2 RBD. Given its high specificity and affinity, we anticipate that these anti-CoV-2 antibodies will be useful as valuable reagents for accessing the antigenicity of vaccine candidates, as well as developing antibody-based therapeutics and diagnostics for CoV-2.

The recently identified novel human coronavirus, referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)–coronavirus 2 (CoV-2), is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19. After the report of first case of the CoV-2 infection in December 2019, it has spread all over the globe. To slow down the spread of COVID-19, many countries have introduced lockdown measures. However, these measures will not be enough to eradicate the coronavirus pandemic from the world, and there is an urgent requirement for some medical intervention to control the spread of infection either in the form of a vaccine or other therapeutic options such as small molecule or therapeutic antibodies. So far, no clinically approved therapeutics are available for CoV-2, and only symptomatic treatment is offered (1Felsenstein S. Herbert J.A. McNamara P.S. Hedrich C.M. COVID-19: immunology and treatment options.Clin. Immunol. 2020; 215 (32353634): 10844810.1016/j.clim.2020.108448Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). One of the approaches is to look for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) for CoV-2 either from convalescent patient samples or from synthetic antibody library sources. The antibodies can work via two different mechanisms, i.e. by direct neutralization of target viral antigen and also by indirect effector mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity, wherein antibody binds to infected cells and potentially clears the viral reservoirs (2Hey A. History and practice: antibodies in infectious diseases.Microbiol. Spectr. 2015; 3 (AID-0026-2014, 26104697)Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Kumar R. Shrivastava T. Samal S. Ahmed S.

The spike (S) protein on the surface of CoV2 plays the primary role in viral attachment to the host cell receptor followed by fusion and entry. The S protein comprises two components: S1, which contains the distinct RBD (residues 318–510); and S2, which contains the fusion peptide. The virus gains entry into permissive host cells through interactions of the RBD with the cell surface receptor ACE2. Therefore, the RBD of CoV-2 S protein is the most likely target for development of virus attachment inhibitors, NAbs, and vaccines (4Premkumar L. Segovia-Chumbez B. Jadi R. Martinez D.R. Raut R. Markmann A. Cornaby C. Bartelt L. Weiss S. Park Y. Edwards C.E. Weimer E. Scherer E.M. Rouphael N. Edupuganti S. et al.The receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein is an immunodominant and highly specific target of antibodies in SARS–CoV-2 patients.Sci. Immunol. 2020; 5 (32527802): eabc841310.1126/sciimmunol.abc8413Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). An antibody against RBD is expected to block the attachment of the surface spike of virions to the ACE2 receptors on the host-cell surface and is thereby supposed to neutralize virus entry. Recent success with plasma therapy from convalescent patient samples against CoV-2 is a good indicator of possible successful antibody-based therapy to avoid further fatalities (5Casadevall A. Pirofski L.A. The convalescent sera option for containing COVID-19.J. Clin. Invest. 2020; 130 (32167489): 1545-154810.1172/JCI138003Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 6Brown B.L.

However, plasma therapy is a crude method of treatment, and a mAb, the main ingredient of plasma therapy, is needed for wide and safe application (7Burnouf T. Seghatchian J. Ebola virus convalescent blood products: where we are now and where we may need to go.Transfus. Apher.

Thus, novel tools and reagents for therapy and diagnosis are urgently needed. Keeping this need in mind, we here used a scFv phage display library to identify a novel scFv, II62, against the RBD of CoV-2 that targets an epitope immediately adjacent to and slightly overlapping with the ACE2-binding region on RBD. We further characterized the binding properties of II62–scFv and its two other formats, scFv-Fc and IgG1, against both the RBD and S protein of CoV-2. The human synthetic Tomlinson I single fold phage library was used for screening of scFvs against the purified (>95% pure) RBD protein from mammalian expression system. Three rounds of panning were done, and the titers of input and output phage were calculated at the end of each round to monitor the efficiency of enrichment. After three rounds of selection, ∼1100-fold enrichment of antigen-specific clones was observed (Fig. 1A). After the third round of panning, 50 clones were randomly picked and assessed for binding to RBD protein by monoclonal scFv-phage ELISA (Fig. 1B). Twenty clones of the 50 showed five times better binding to RBD in ELISA as compared with the negative controls (BSA and helper phage) and hence were considered as RBD-specific binders. One clone of scFv, II62, was dominantly selected via panning (50% of the selected binders) and was selected for further characterization (Fig. 1C). The complete nucleotide sequence of the heavy and light chain variable region was determined using the immunoglobulin BLAST homology search. The result indicated that the coding sequences are composed of the VH gene (351 bp) and the VL gene (327 bp). The closest germline sequence for the II62 scFv-antibody gene was identified by comparison with the database. The VH gene use the VH3 family-derived germline V3-23, D2-15, and JH4 genes, whereas the VL gene uses the VL1 (Vκ subgroup I, V1–39) family-derived germline and Jk1. Also, a high degree of mutation appeared in VH complementarity-determining region 2. The II62 mAb sequence showed 70.8% (bases) homology to the closest germline match (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1). The His-tagged II62–scFv was overexpressed in a bacterial system and purified as soluble protein using the Ni–NTA affinity column. Overall yield of the II62–scFv was 3 mg/liter with >90% purity. The purified II62–scFv migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE with an estimated molecular mass of 28 kDa (Fig. S2D) and same was confirmed by Western blotting using HRP-conjugated anti-His antibody (data not shown). The functional activity and specificity of the purified II62–scFv was assessed by its binding to the RBD protein in ELISA. The II62–scFv showed specific binding to the RBD and did not bind to unrelated proteins like BSA and the envelope proteins from HIV and Chikungunya (Fig. 2, B and C). The scFvs are monovalent in nature and lack the Fc-mediated functions. The Fc domain of human IgG1 was introduced to produce a homodimeric II62–scFv-Fc chimeric protein that is capable of bivalent binding and that retains Fc functions (Fig. 2D). The II62–scFv-Fc construct was transiently expressed in Expi293F cells and subsequently purified by using protein G affinity column, with >95% purity and yields of 40–60 mg/liter. The purified II62–scFv-Fc migrated as a single protein band on SDS–PAGE with an estimated molecular mass of 55 kDa (Fig. S2E). The scFv-Fc showed specific binding to RBD in ELISA (Fig. 2, E and F). The full-length version of the II62–scFv (II62–IgG1) was purified from the supernatant of transiently transfected Expi293F cells using protein A/G affinity columns (Fig. 2G). The purified IgG1 migrated as two protein bands on SDS–PAGE with estimated molecular mass of 50 kDa for heavy chain and 25 kDa for light chain (Fig. S2F). Overall yield of the II62–IgG1 was 80–100 mg/liter with >98% purity. The purified II62–IgG1 also showed specific binding to CoV-2 RBD protein (Fig. 2, H and I). To evaluate the affinity of scFv-Fc and IgG1 format of II62 against the RBD, the antibodies were captured on the anti-human Fc biosensor and RBD was used as analyte in concentrations ranging from 10.0 to 0.6 μm with half-fold serial dilution. The scFv-Fc format showed an affinity of ∼700 nm with both slow on (1.5 × 102 (1/Ms)) and off (1.1 × 10−4 (1/s)) rate, suggesting that the scFv-Fc format binds slowly to the RBD, but once bound it also dissociates slowly (Fig. 3A). The full-length format, II62–IgG1, showed an affinity of ∼160 nm, with an on rate of (kon) of 3.3 × 102 (1/Ms) and off rate (koff) of 5.3 × 10−5 (1/s) (Fig. 3B). We investigated the binding of II62–scFv-Fc and IgG1 with the cell surface–expressed CoV-2 S protein in native conformation. For this, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmid containing the full-length S protein gene to express the same on the cell surface. The cells were then incubated with II62 scFv or IgG1 and analyzed by flow cytometry. The CoV-2 S proteins expressed on the 293T cell surface were readily detected by II62–scFv-Fc and IgG1. The results suggest that both formats of II62 recognizes the CoV-2 S protein on the cell surface (Fig. 3C and Figs. S3 and S4). Specificity of different antibody formats of II62 (scFv, scFv-Fc, and IgG1) were further individually tested for their specific binding to CoV-2 RBD by immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by Western blotting analysis. All the three antibody formats showed specific binding to RBD protein in co-IP (Fig. 3D). Binding specificity of II62 mAb was also tested toward purified soluble spike protein through Western blotting analysis and ELISA. Antibody II62 specifically recognizes the band of ∼180-kDa (uncleaved soluble spike) (Fig. 3E and Fig. S5). Like other coronaviruses, the S protein of CoV-2 contains cleavage sites, and the precursor S protein is cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits by host-cell proteases (9Shang J. Wan Y. Luo C. Ye G. Geng Q. Auerbach A. Li F. Cell entry mechanisms of SARS–CoV-2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2020; 26 (32376634): 11727-1173410.1073/pnas.2003138117Crossref Scopus (1883) Google Scholar), an important step for initializing of infection. To further assess the effect of the binding of II62–IgG1 to cleaved and uncleaved forms of the S protein, 293T cells were transiently transfected with pseudo virus expressing CoV-2 S protein plasmid. Cell lysates of these transfected cells were immunoblotted with II62–IgG1. Immunoblotting of the cell lysate revealed two bands for the CoV-2 S protein at ∼110–130 kDa, which might be the uncleaved S1 protein (Fig. 3F and Fig. S6). The molecular mass of each monomer of trimeric S protein is ∼180 kDa and contains two subunits: S1 (110 kDa) and S2 (70 kDa) (10Qian Z. Dominguez S.R. Holmes K.V. Role of the spike glycoprotein of human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in virus entry and syncytia formation.PLoS One. 2013; 8 (24098509): e7646910.1371/journal.pone.0076469Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The Western blotting showed another band at the position of 90 kDa reflecting the presence of cleaved S1 protein (Fig. 3F and Fig. S6). The band size above 200 kDa likely shows the presence of dimeric or trimeric S proteins as reported previously (11Ou X. Liu Y. Lei X. Li P. Mi D. Ren L. Guo L. Guo R. Chen T. Hu J. Xiang Z. Mu Z. Chen X. Chen J. Hu K. et al.Characterization of spike glycoprotein of SARS–CoV-2 on virus entry and its immune cross-reactivity with SARS–CoV.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 (32221306): 162010.1038/s41467-020-15562-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar). The hot-spot residues involved in mAb–RBD interactions have been identified using protein–protein docking approaches. Through multiple quantitative analysis, we found 24 residues of RBD interact with II62–scFv. Of these residues Ser344, Arg341, Phe481, Tyr484, Tyr346, Tyr446, and Tyr488 of RBD were found to contribute significantly (Fig. 4A). While comparing the interacting interfaces of the complex of RBD–scFv with RBD–ACE2, 11 residues were found in common between RBD–scFv and RBD–ACE2. The sequence-wise comparisons among CoV/CoV-2/MERS revealed the structurally and sequentially conserved residues i.e. Tyr346, Tyr446, and Leu487, indicating that this mAb is possibly occupying the RBD–ACE2–interacting site (Fig. 4 and supporting information). The RBD of SARS–CoV and CoV-2 S protein uses ACE2 on the host cell surface as receptor. The NAbs can block this interaction and prevent virus entry into the host cell (12Shi R. Shan C. Duan X. Chen Z. Liu P. Song J. Song T. Bi X. Han C. Wu L. Gao G. Hu X. Zhang Y. Tong Z. Huang W. et al.A human neutralizing antibody targets the receptor binding site of SARS–CoV-2.Nature. 2020; 10.1038/s41586-020-2381-yCrossref Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Phage display technique is a powerful tool that has been used for years for the discovery of therapeutic mAbs against infectious diseases (13Kumar R. Andrabi R. Tiwari A. Prakash S.S. Wig N. Dutta D. Sankhyan A. Khan L. Sinha S. Luthra K. A novel strategy for efficient production of anti-V3 human scFvs against HIV-1 clade C.BMC Biotechnol. 2012; 12 (23153214): 8710.1186/1472-6750-12-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The advantage of usage of such libraries is that it avoids the direct use of patients' samples in a pandemic situation and related ethical, safety, and handling concerns (14Kumar R. Parray H.A. Shrivastava T. Sinha S. Luthra K. Phage display antibody libraries: A robust approach for generation of recombinant human monoclonal antibodies.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2019; 135 (31170490): 907-91810.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Biopanning of Tomlinson I library against CoV-2 RBD captured II62 as predominant clone that showed specific binding to CoV-2 RBD protein. We further engineered and characterized three different formats of the selected II62–scFv, i.e. scFv, scFv-Fc, and IgG1, respectively. We examined the binding of different formats to CoV-2 RBD protein by ELISA and by co-IP followed by Western blotting analysis. The results show that all three formats efficiently and specifically bind to the CoV-2 RBD protein. Next, we tested whether these formats bind with native-like cell surface–expressed S protein by flow cytometry analysis of transiently transfected HEK293T cells expressing membrane-bound CoV-2 S protein. Our data suggest that the II62 antibody formats (scFv-Fc and IgG1) bind to a conformational epitope on the full-length S protein as presented on the cell surface. Furthermore, we determined the binding affinity of these mAb formats using biolayer interferometry. Both scFv-Fc and IgG1 effectively bind with nanomolar affinity to CoV-2 RBD. The RBD in the S1 domain of CoV-2 S protein interacts with the ACE2 receptors expressed on the host cell that triggers a conformational change of the S2 domain, resulting in formation of six helix bundles and insertion of fusion peptide into the host cell. It is reported that most of the CoV-2 S proteins in pseudovirions are cleaved, and our results suggest that II62 mAb binds efficiently to various forms of S protein. This mAb could be potentially used to address various research questions on CoV-2 S protein biosynthesis, cleavage, intracellular processing, and expression and will help to identify non-neutralizing epitopes to facilitate design of conformationally stable vaccine candidates. Similar findings have been previously reported for MERS (10Qian Z. Dominguez S.R. Holmes K.V. Role of the spike glycoprotein of human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in virus entry and syncytia formation.PLoS One. 2013; 8 (24098509): e7646910.1371/journal.pone.0076469Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Because of sequence divergence among MERS, CoV, and CoV-2, most of the polyclonal and mAbs raised against MERS and CoV poorly cross-react with CoV-2 (15Haynes B.F. Ma B. Montefiori D.C. Wrin T. Petropoulos C.J. Sutherland L.L. Scearce R.M. Denton C. Xia S.M. Korber B.T. Liao H.X. Analysis of HIV-1 subtype B third variable region peptide motifs for induction of neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 primary isolates.Virology. 2006; 345 (16242749): 44-5510.1016/j.virol.2005.08.042Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In future it will be important to determine whether this mAb can also cross-react with MERS and CoV S proteins. Interestingly, the gene sequence of II62 reveals only few somatic mutations compared with the closest germline genes. The II62 mAb did not show significant reduction in neutralization potential in cytopathic effect–based and plaque reduction assay when tested up to 100 µg/ml against CoV-2 live virus (Figs. S7 and S8). Docking study suggests that the II62–scFv epitope on RBD partially overlaps with the ACE2-binding site. It was further supported by the ACE2–RBD competition assay (Fig. S9). The II62–scFv-Fc antibody showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2 (starting from 5 to 0.008 μm). The other possible explanation is that the epitope is inaccessible in the closed prefusion form of S protein and accessible only in open post-fusion conformation. Pinto et al. (16Pinto D. Park Y.-J. Beltramello M. Walls A.C. Tortorici M.A. Bianchi S. Jaconi S. Culap K. Zatta F. De Marco A. Peter A. Guarino B. Spreafico R. Cameroni E. Case J.B. et al.Cross-neutralization of SARS–CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS–CoV antibody.Nature. 2020; 583: 290-29510.1038/s41586-020-2349-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) also reported similar phenomenon with mAbs S306 and S310 that recognize post-fusion conformation of CoV-2 S glycoprotein and were found to be poorly neutralizing. Similar findings have been recently reported for non-neutralizing behavior of CR3022 to CoV-2 (17Yuan M. Wu N.C. Zhu X. Lee C.-C.D. So R.T.Y. Lv H. Mok C.K.P. Wilson I.A. A highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor binding domains of SARS–CoV-2 and SARS–CoV.Science. 2020; 368 (32245784): 630-63310.1126/science.abb7269Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Human and animal studies for various viral infection model and vaccine studies clearly suggests that non-NAb in vitro may play an important role to block cell surface infection in vivo without disturbing virus entry (18Excler J.L. Ake J. Robb M.L. Kim J.H. Plotkin S.A. Nonneutralizing functional antibodies: a new “old” paradigm for HIV vaccines.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2014; 21 (24920599): 1023-103610.1128/CVI.00230-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The high affinity and specificity of II62 mAb makes it an attractive target in mucosal antibody–based prevention strategies to trap the virus particles even with non-NAb mAbs before they initiate infection. In the past it has been shown that topical application of mAb was ∼100 times more effective than systemic delivery (19Prince G.A. Hemming V.G. Horswood R.L. Baron P.A. Chanock R.M. Effectiveness of topically administered neutralizing antibodies in experimental immunotherapy of respiratory syncytial virus infection in cotton rats.J.

Our study also provides a way to compare different engineered versions of a mAb and their suitability for different applications. The one advantage of scFv format is that it is devoid of Fc-mediated functions that sometimes exaggerate the infection through ADE (20Ngono A.E. Shresta S. Immune response to dengue and Zika.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 36 (29345964): 279-30810.1146/annurev-immunol-042617-053142Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Wan et al. (21Wan Y. Shang J. Sun S. Tai W. Chen J. Geng Q. He L. Chen Y. Wu J. Shi Z. Zhou Y. Du L. Li F. Molecular mechanism for antibody-dependent enhancement of coronavirus entry.J. Virol. 2020; 94 (31826992): e02015-e0201910.1128/JVI.02015-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) suggested that ADE events could also happen with anti-CoV-2 Abs. To overcome the ADE-related issues, one approach is to develop either scFv or llamas antibodies that are devoid of Fc-related functions (22Benjathummarak S. Pipattanaboon C. Boonha K. Wongwit W. Ramasoota P. Pitaksajjakul P. Human single-chain variable fragment antibody expressed in E. coli with optimal in vitro cross-neutralizing and no enhancing activity.Biologicals. 2018; 56 (30431001): 54-6210.1016/j.biologicals.2018.10.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Our study opens a path forward toward isolation of scFv molecules with high affinity and specificity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation and characterization of scFv and its other formats for CoV-2 using the human semisynthetic Tomlinson I phagemid library. The other interesting observation of our study is that II62 mAb showed more ELISA binding reactivity with baculovirus expressed RBD-His protein as compared with mammalian expressed RBD–His protein (Fig. S10). Similar findings have also been recently reported in a preprint from Bertoglio et al. (23Bertoglio F. Meier D. Langreder N. Steinke S. Rand U. Simonelli L. Heine P.A. Ballmann R. Schneider K.-T. Roth K.D.R. Ruschig M. Riese P. Eschke K. Kim Y.

One probable reason for this is the different protein glycosylation pathways of the heterologous hosts. The stock of Tomlinson I library was expanded and amplified in 2× TY (tryptone and yeast extract) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose. The panning procedure was performed according to the Tomlinson manual (28Abou El-Magd R.M. Vozza N.F. Tuszynski J.A. Wishart D.S.

A detailed methodology for this has been provided in the supporting information. After the third round of biopanning, individual colonies were picked and tested for specificity by phage ELISA. Monoclonal phage ELISA was carried out as described by Kumar et al. (13Kumar R. Andrabi R. Tiwari A. Prakash S.S. Wig N. Dutta D. Sankhyan A. Khan L. Sinha S. Luthra K. A novel strategy for efficient production of anti-V3 human scFvs against HIV-1 clade C.BMC Biotechnol. 2012; 12 (23153214): 8710.1186/1472-6750-12-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and Spriestersbach et al.

Briefly, individual colonies from third round of selection were grown in 2× TY medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose and infected with helper phage in 96-well plate format. The plate was then incubated at 30 °C with shaking overnight. 50 μl of the supernatant from each well was used for phage ELISA. His-tagged codon optimized genes for mammalian expression were used for transient transfection of CoV-2 RBD and S protein ectodomain in Expi293F cells to produce the recombinant proteins and purified by Ni–NTA affinity chromatography following standard protocol (25Spriestersbach A. Kubicek J. Schäfer F. Block H. Maertens B. Purification of His-tagged proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2015; 559 (26096499): 1-1510.1016/bs.mie.2014.11.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For scFv-Fc format, the II62–scFv gene was amplified using gene-specific primers and cloned into pCMX2.5–hIgG1–XP vector using NcoI and NotI restriction enzymes. For II62–IgG1 the variable regions of the heavy and light chains were cloned into respective expression plasmids containing the constant regions of human IgG1 heavy chain and Igκ light chain (InvivoGen). In each case proper cloning was confirmed by gene sequencing. For expression of soluble II62–scFv HB2151 strain of Escherichia coli bearing scFv plasmid was grown in 1 liter of 2× TY medium at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. The culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 0.4–0.6 and incubated at 18 °C for 16–20 h. The II62–scFv antibody was purified from the periplasmic fraction using Ni–NTA affinity chromatography. The scFv-Fc and IgG1 formats were expressed by transient transfection of respective plasmids in Expi293F cells, and both the antibody formats were purified using protein G affinity column. For phage ELISA, NUNC Maxisorp plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated with 100 μl of RBD protein or soluble S protein (200 ng per well), 50 μl of phage-rescued supernatants diluted in 50 μl of 2% milk PBS were added to each well and incubated for 1 h. HRP-conjugated anti-M13 (Sigma) was used for developing ELISA with tetramethylbenzidine substrate. For CoV-2 antigen-specific ELISA, the plates were coated with equimolar amounts of antigens. Different formats of antibody were added in serial dilutions starting from 20 μg/ml. In case of II62–scFv antibody, HRP-conjugated protein L was used as secondary antibody. For Fc-bearing antibody formats, HRP-conjugated goat anti-human secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) was used. Standard protocols of blocking and washing of ELISA plates were followed. For IP, 1 µg of purified protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 µg of mAbs of choice in the presence of protein G–agarose (100 µl of 50% slurry; G Biosciences) followed by washing of beads with PBS before SDS-PAGE analysis. In the case of scFv, the Fc-tagged RBD protein was immobilized to protein G beads, and His-tagged scFv was pulled down. For scFv-Fc and IgG1, the antibodies were immobilized to protein G beads, and RBD-His was pulled down. For Western blotting analysis, the proteins were transferred from PAGE to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk and developed with HRP-conjugated anti-His antibody in 1:3000 dilutions for 2 h at room temperature. For measuring binding kinetics, anti-human Fc sensors (ForteBio Inc.) were used to capture the scFv-Fc or the IgG1 antibody formats, and the RBD-His was used as analyte. The analytes were used in various concentrations with half-fold serial dilution in the PBS buffer background supplemented with 0.1% BSA. The ligands were used at a concentration of 10 µg/ml. Associations and dissociations were recorded for 1500 s. The data were analyzed using the ForteBio data analysis software, 10.0 (Forte-Bio Inc.). The kinetic parameters were calculated using a global fit 1:1 model. For RBD the crystal structure 6M17 was used. Based on sequence identity/similarity homology model was generated and validated. Protein–protein docking tools were used to identify the most likely binding interface (26Kanwal A. Kasetti S. Putcha U.K. Asthana S. Banerjee S.K.

https://openalex.org/W3045837334,"Considering the importance of coping strategies and resilience in adapting to the stress caused by cancer, the objective of this research is to explore which coping strategies are the most used, in order to know whether different groups of levels of resilience and an appropriate coping style are related to a higher quality of life and better adaptation to the disease. There were 74 participants with cancer in this study (79.7% of them were women) ranging in age from 29 to 85 years (M = 50.9). Different instruments were used to measure the resilience construct (ER-20 items Resilience Scale), coping strategies (Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Short) and quality of life (General Health Questionnaire). People with higher resilience showed higher scores in the use of adaptive strategies, being acceptance and positive revaluation the most frequent ones. Regarding perception of quality of life, people with lower resilience showed statistically significant differences in the dimensions of pain and general health, which were likewise the most common ones for people with lower resilience. A significant association has been demonstrated between resilience and an adaptive coping, which at the same time are positively linked to quality of life of people with cancer. This study provides information about how different groups of resilience levels are related with coping and quality of life in people with cancer. It could be useful information for psychologists in the oncological area who have to take decisions in the clinical context. A practical consequence would involve trying to modify the type of coping, as well as increasing the level of resilience in people with cancer, in order to achieve a better adjustment to the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3045618397,"Hydraulic fracturing is a key method used in completion of shale gas wells as well as in well stimulation. There are a lot of factors affecting the hydraulic fracturing treatment; i.e. formation in-situ stresses, fracturing fluid properties, proppant, pumping rate, reservoir fluid and rock properties…etc. For predictive modeling, these factors are associated with a lot of uncertainties, since most of them are laboratory measured, calculated or subjectively estimated. Moreover, the precise contribution of each factor on the final fracturing result is unknown for each individual case. Therefore, for better treatment performance and in order to find the best range of designing parameters, a hydraulic fracturing predictive model that involves these uncertainties is required specially for newly exploited shale gas reservoir. In this paper a new uncertainty-based approach is described for hydraulic fracturing processes. It is based on assigning probability distribution for some variables and parameters used in the designing process. These probability distributions are used as input data for analytical equations that describe the fracturing processes. Monte Carlo Simulation technique is used to apply uncertainty-based values on the designing analytical formulas. A hypothetical hydraulic fracturing example is used to simulate the effect of different variables and designing parameters on the entire fracturing process. The simulation results are illustrated into probability distribution curves and variance-based sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the contribution and the correlation between different variables and outcomes. Fracture geometry is almost controlled by the injection fluid's viscosity, in case of constant injection rate; while rock properties have insignificant effect on the fracture width compares to fracturing fluid's effect. Therefore more emphases shall be directed to rheological modeling of the fracturing fluid. It is found also that fracture height, which is difficult to be estimated, is the most crucial parameter in the calculation of treatment size or the injected fluid's volume. Proppant porosity, injected fluid viscosity and formation strength are slightly affecting propped fracture width, while proppant final concentration plays the main role of determining the calculated propped fracture width. It is observed from the simulation results that the initial formation permeability will extremely affect the post fracturing skin factor while other formation rock properties have almost no effect on the skin factor. Throughout the implementation of the uncertainty-based modeling approach for hydraulic fracturing process design, it is found that uncertainties in the value of many variables and parameters are slightly affecting the process outcomes. However, injected fluid viscosity, shale formation permeability and proppant final concentration are found to be the most influencing factors in the entire process. Therefore, it is highly recommended to perform in-depth study for these factors prior conducting any designing process of hydraulic fracturing."
https://openalex.org/W3045773086,"The human innate immunity factor apolipoprotein L-I (APOL1) protects against infection by several protozoan parasites, including Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Endocytosis and acidification of high-density lipoprotein–associated APOL1 in trypanosome endosomes leads to eventual lysis of the parasite due to increased plasma membrane cation permeability, followed by colloid-osmotic swelling. It was previously shown that recombinant APOL1 inserts into planar lipid bilayers at acidic pH to form pH-gated nonselective cation channels that are opened upon pH neutralization. This corresponds to the pH changes encountered during endocytic recycling, suggesting APOL1 forms a cytotoxic cation channel in the parasite plasma membrane. Currently, the mechanism and domains required for channel formation have yet to be elucidated, although a predicted helix-loop-helix (H-L-H) was suggested to form pores by virtue of its similarity to bacterial pore-forming colicins. Here, we compare recombinant human and baboon APOL1 orthologs, along with interspecies chimeras and individual amino acid substitutions, to identify regions required for channel formation and pH gating in planar lipid bilayers. We found that whereas neutralization of glutamates within the H-L-H may be important for pH-dependent channel formation, there was no evidence of H-L-H involvement in either pH gating or ion selectivity. In contrast, we found two residues in the C-terminal domain, tyrosine 351 and glutamate 355, that influence pH gating properties, as well as a single residue, aspartate 348, that determines both cation selectivity and pH gating.

However, globally common human APOL1 variants cannot protect against APOL1-resistant T. brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense, the parasite species responsible for human African trypanosomiasis. In primates, the APOL1 gene is evolving rapidly, and variants exist with broader trypanolytic potential. For example, baboon APOL1 orthologs kill both human-infective subspecies T. brucei rhodesiense and T. brucei gambiense, whereas a human APOL1 variant termed G2 protects against T. brucei rhodesiense infection (7Thomson R.

Following endocytic uptake of high-density lipoprotein–associated APOL1 into acidic parasite endosomes, African trypanosomes undergo colloid-osmotic swelling and eventual lysis due to an increased plasma membrane cation permeability, which is proposed to result from APOL1 recycling to the plasma membrane, where it forms nonselective cation channels (12Rifkin M.R.

In agreement with this model, cation channel formation by recombinant human APOL1 requires acidic pH (as in endosomes), whereas channel opening requires subsequent pH neutralization (as in recycling to the plasma membrane) (14Thomson R.

Despite implications for both trypanosomiasis and kidney disease, the molecular details of channel formation by APOL1 remain poorly understood. APOL1 lacks close homology with any known channel-forming proteins, although analogies are made to bacterial pore-forming toxins. Similar to APOL1, these toxins exist as soluble proteins that undergo a conformational change at acidic pH and associate with lipid bilayers to form membrane pores (18Finkelstein A. Channels formed in phospholipid bilayer membranes by diphtheria, tetanus, botulinum and anthrax toxin.J. Physiol. (Paris). 1990; 84 (1705290): 188-190PubMed Google Scholar). APOL1 also contains a predicted helix-loop-helix (H-L-H) of putative membrane-spanning helices (residues 177–228), which is analogous to the so-called hydrophobic hairpin of diphtheria toxin translocation domain (DpTx-TD) and pore-forming colicins. The hairpin is buried in the crystal structures of colicin and diphtheria toxins at neutral pH (19Choe S. Bennett M.J. Fujii G. Curmi P.M. Kantardjieff K.A. Collier R.J. Eisenberg D.

Indeed, a peptide just encompassing the hairpin of DpTx-TD (helices 8 and 9) forms channels with conductance properties similar to those of the intact DpTx-TD (23Silverman J.A. Mindell J.A. Finkelstein A. Shen W.H. Collier R.J. Mutational analysis of the helical hairpin region of diphtheria toxin transmembrane domain.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (7521329): 22524-22532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on hairpin homology, and on similarity to the C-terminal domain of pore-forming colicins, it was proposed that residues 60–235 of APOL1 constitute the “pore-forming domain” (24Pérez-Morga D. Vanhollebeke B. Paturiaux-Hanocq F. Nolan D.P. Lins L. Homblé F. Vanhamme L. Tebabi P. Pays A. Poelvoorde P. Jacquet A. Brasseur R. Pays E.

However, the relevance of the H-L-H to channel formation by APOL1 has not been experimentally tested. Unlike in colicins, there are 170 amino acids C-terminal of the APOL1 H-L-H, including a C-terminal domain (CTD; residues 332-398) that contains a putative transmembrane helix and a leucine zipper domain; the CTD also contains the G1 and G2 amino acid changes responsible for APOL1 variant–associated kidney disease. Truncated APOL1 fragments that lack parts of the CTD cannot form channels and do not kill trypanosomes, suggesting that the CTD may be involved in channel formation (4Molina-Portela M.P. Samanovic M. Raper J. Distinct roles of apolipoprotein components within the trypanosome lytic factor complex revealed in a novel transgenic mouse model.J. Exp.

However, it remains to be seen whether these deficiencies result simply from misfolding of these protein fragments. In this study, we exploited a baboon APOL1 ortholog which is different enough from human APOL1 (59% identity) to engender enhanced trypanolytic potential yet similar enough to form functional human-baboon APOL1 chimeras (8Thomson R. Molina-Portela P. Mott H. Carrington M. Raper J. Hydrodynamic gene delivery of baboon trypanosome lytic factor eliminates both animal and human-infective African trypanosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We show that recombinant baboon APOL1 forms conductances in planar lipid bilayers that are less pH-dependent and less cation-selective than those formed by human APOL1. Using interspecies chimeras, as well as single amino acid substitutions, we dissect the contributions of hairpin (H-L-H) and C-terminal domains to channel formation by APOL1. Although our data point to a role of the hairpin in facilitating pH-dependent membrane insertion, we found no evidence for hairpin involvement in selectivity or gating functions. Instead, we demonstrate a central role for the putative transmembrane region of the CTD in these aspects of channel formation. Differences between the lytic capacities of human and baboon APOL1 have long been established, with baboon APOL1 having the ability to lyse the human-infective subspecies T. brucei rhodesiense and T. brucei gambiense (7Thomson R.

Whereas C-terminal differences account for lysis of T. brucei rhodesiense, the mechanism by which T. brucei gambiense is lysed by baboon APOL1 has yet to be identified. To identify potential differences in channel-forming properties between human and baboon APOL1, recombinant APOL1 (rAPOL1) proteins were first purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (14Thomson R. Finkelstein A. Human trypanolytic factor APOL1 forms pH-gated cation-selective channels in planar lipid bilayers: relevance to trypanosome lysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recombinant human APOL1 (HsAPOL1) and recombinant baboon APOL1 (PhAPOL1) were first tested in 24-h trypanolytic assays. As expected, both proteins killed T. brucei brucei 427 in vitro (Fig. S1), whereas PhAPOL1 also killed 427-SRA (T. brucei rhodesiense) and T. brucei gambiense, confirming its enhanced lytic activity (Fig. S2). To assess any differences in channel formation, we compared the ability of HsAPOL1 and PhAPOL1 to form a conductance in the planar lipid bilayers (Fig. 1A). As reported previously, HsAPOL1 can only insert into bilayers to form a conductance when exposed to a cis-acidic buffer of pH <6.0 (Fig. 1B) (14Thomson R. Finkelstein A.

In contrast, PhAPOL1 began to form a conductance at cis pH 7.2, and the rate of formation was substantially increased when the cis side was acidified slightly to pH 6.6 (Fig. 1B), indicating a relaxed pH dependence. To account for this difference, we focused on an H-L-H motif (residues 177–228), which may be similar to the hydrophobic hairpin of bacterial pore-forming toxins (26Mindell J.A. Silverman J.A. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Structure-function relationships in diphtheria toxin channels: III. Residues which affect the cis pH dependence of channel conductance.J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 137 (7516434): 45-5710.1007/BF00234997PubMed Google Scholar). The H-L-H of HsAPOL1 contains two acidic amino acid residues, glutamate 201 and glutamate 213 (Glu-201/Glu-213), which are replaced by the uncharged alanine 187 and glycine 199 (Ala-187/Gly-199) in PhAPOL1 (Fig. 2). We hypothesized that substituting these glutamate residues to match baboon APOL1 (Fig. 2) would result in a gain of function toward channel formation at pH 7.2 (Fig. 3A). However, the ability of HsAPOL1 E201A/E213G to form channels was still dependent on acidification, similar to HsAPOL1 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, when PhAPOL1 residues alanine 187 and glycine 199 were substituted for glutamate to match the human residues (A187E/G199E), there was a loss of conductance formation at neutral pH 7.2 (Fig. 3C), whereas conductance formation at acidic pH was maintained (Fig. 3D). Therefore, nonpolar residues in the baboon APOL1 H-L-H allow for channel formation at neutral pH, whereas the mechanisms by which human APOL1 forms channels in a strictly pH-dependent manner remain unclear.Figure 2Comparison of the human and baboon APOL1 H-L-H region.

A, schematic of human (left) and baboon (right) APOL1 H-L-H region showing human-specific glutamate residues (left), and their baboon-specific counterparts (right). At neutral pH, the three charged glutamates of the human H-L-H could impede lipid bilayer insertion of the human H-L-H to a greater extent than the baboon H-L-H, which has only one glutamate in this region (Glu-195). B–D, planar lipid bilayers were formed between symmetric solutions of chamber buffer (pH 7.2). Each panel represents a separate experiment, during which the experimenter set the voltage (bottom trace, mV) as the current was recorded (top trace, pA). B, a total of 500 ng of HsAPOL1 E201A/E213G was added to the cis side, which was then gradually acidified with HCl (2-pA scale, left side of dashed line). The current did not begin to change until after the pH was brought to 5.8. As expected, subsequent neutralization (pH 7.3) resulted in a large conductance increase due to channel opening (40-pA scale, right of dashed line). C, a total of 160 ng of PhAPOL1 A187E/G199E was added to the cis side, which caused no change in current. After perfusion with chamber buffer (pH 7.2) to remove soluble protein, the addition of just 80 ng of PhAPOL1 to the same bilayer resulted in a significant rate of current change at pH 7.2, which was then further increased by acidification to pH 5.6. D, 160 ng of PhAPOL1 A187E/G199E was added to the cis side, which again did not affect the current at pH 7.2; however, upon acidification to pH 5.6, a rapid increase in the current magnitude was observed, which was visible on the nA scale (right of dashed line). Similar to PhAPOL1 (see Fig. 4B), there was only a 3-fold increase in conductance upon subsequent pH neutralization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate potential differences in pH gating between human and baboon APOL1, recombinant proteins were subjected to titrations with KOH and HCl in the planar bilayer system (Fig. 4). As shown previously, the conductance formed by HsAPOL1 is minimal after insertion into the bilayer at pH 5.6 but increases 100–500-fold upon pH neutralization (Fig. 4A). This increase, which is plotted as a sigmoidal titration curve with a pKa of around 7 (Fig. 4C), is due to the opening of pH-gated channels (14Thomson R. Finkelstein A. Human trypanolytic factor APOL1 forms pH-gated cation-selective channels in planar lipid bilayers: relevance to trypanosome lysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112 (25730870): 2894-289910.1073/pnas.1421953112Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, PhAPOL1 formed a relatively large conductance at pH 5.6, and this conductance increased in a nonsigmoidal manner by only 3–5-fold after alkalization to pH 9.2 (Fig. 4, B and C). To account for this difference, we returned to the diphtheria toxin-like H-L-H region (Fig. 2). However, HsAPOL1 E201A/E213G had pH gating properties nearly identical to those of HsAPOL1, indicating that these residues do not contribute to channel gating (Fig. S3). As C-terminal deletions of APOL1 have been shown to lose functional activity, we next asked whether differences between the CTD of baboon and human APOL1 could explain the divergence in pH gating. We previously found that replacing the entire human APOL1 CTD (residues 322–398) with the entire baboon APOL1 CTD (residues 313–388) generated a nonfunctional (nontrypanolytic) chimera in a transgenic mouse system (8Thomson R. Molina-Portela P. Mott H. Carrington M. Raper J. Hydrodynamic gene delivery of baboon trypanosome lytic factor eliminates both animal and human-infective African trypanosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whereas pH gating of the C1 chimera (which differs from HsAPOL1 in the leucine zipper domain) was unchanged compared with HsAPOL1, the C2 chimera had altered pH gating with a shift toward the open state at a more acidic pH (Fig. 5B). As the C1 and C2 chimeras differ by only four amino acid residues at the C-terminal end of a predicted transmembrane region, we made a third chimera (C3) containing only these baboon-specific residues (Y351G, Y354C, E355Q, and S356L) in a human APOL1 background (Fig. 5A). As expected, the titration curve was identical to that of the C2 chimera, indicating that some or all of residues 351 and 354–356 are involved in pH gating (Fig. 5B). We then used a fourth chimera (C4; Fig. 5A) to ask whether the human residues could reconstitute pH gating when substituted into baboon APOL1. Indeed, the C4 titration curve was shifted to a midway point between the human and baboon APOL1, suggesting partial reconstitution of pH gating (Fig. 5C). To identify which of the four human-specific residues contribute to pH gating, we made individual amino acid substitutions in the HsAPOL1 background (Fig. 5A), focusing on the two tyrosines (Tyr-351 and Tyr-354) and the glutamate (Glu-355), as these residues are conceivably proton-titratable within the relevant pH range. The pH gating of HsAPOL1 Y354C was similar to HsAPOL1, whereas the pH gating of APOL1 Y351G and E355Q were significantly altered (Fig. 5D). The Y351G substitution caused an approximately one-unit decrease in pKa, whereas replacing tyrosine with the similarly shaped but untitratable phenylalanine (Y351F) caused no change in the titration curve (Fig. 5D). We conclude that Tyr-351 is not the pH sensor, but that it may influence the microenvironment of a pH-gating residue, affecting its apparent pKa. Conversely, substitution of glutamate 355 for the isosteric but nontitratable glutamine (E355Q) shifted the pKa nearly one unit toward alkalinity, suggesting that protonation of Glu-355 contributes to normal pH gating of HsAPOL1 (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, the effect of Glu-355 on gating was contingent on the presence of tyrosine at position 351, as the C3 chimera (which contains both Y351G and E355Q substitutions)produced a pH titration curve similar to the single Y351G substitution alone (Fig. 5, B and D). These results suggest that the putative CTD transmembrane region is involved in pH gating of the APOL1 channel. Having identified separate determinants of channel formation/membrane insertion versus pH gating, we next sought to identify the pore-lining region of APOL1. First, we compared the cation versus anion selectivity of human and baboon APOL1 by measuring the reversal potential (Erev) in the presence of an increasing cis:trans KCl gradient (Fig. 6A). If the channel pore is nonselective, then KCl will diffuse down its concentration gradient with no net transfer of charge, resulting in Erev = 0. On the other hand, if the channel pore is ideally selective for K+ over Cl−, then a cis negative voltage equal to the Nernst potential must be applied to prevent the net movement of charge (see “Materials and methods”). In agreement with previously published results, HsAPOL1 was ideally cation-selective at pH 7.2 (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, we found that PhAPOL"

To examine these features, we use fluorescence microscopy to measure the oligomer stability and FRET efficiency for homo- and hetero-oligomers of fluorescent protein-labeled forms of EGFR and its paralog, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ERBB2) in vesicles derived from mammalian cell membranes. We observe that both receptors form ligand-independent oligomers at physiological plasma membrane concentrations. Mutations introduced in the kinase region at the active state asymmetric kinase dimer interface do not affect the stability of ligand-independent EGFR oligomers. These results indicate that ligand-independent EGFR oligomers form using interactions that are distinct from the EGFR active state.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB1) and its paralogs human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ERBB2), HER3/ERBB3, and HER4/ERBB4, collectively known as ERBBs, are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are essential for normal growth and development (1Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J.

Abnormal activation of both EGFR and HER2 is associated with multiple human cancer types, and each is the target of several anticancer agents (2Sacco A.G. Worden F.P.

ERBBs are Type I integral membrane proteins composed of an extracellular domain (ECD) that is made up of four distinct subdomains, an α-helical transmembrane domain (TMD), and an intracellular domain comprising a juxtamembrane region, a tyrosine kinase domain, and a nonglobular ∼230 amino acid C-terminal tail. The canonical mechanism by which ERBBs are thought to act is ligand-dependent oligomerization, which results in stimulation of the intracellular kinase, trans-autophosphorylation, recruitment of effector proteins, and initiation of intracellular signaling cascades (1Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J.

Binding of ligand to these ECDs stabilizes an extended conformation in which an extended β-hairpin (termed the dimerization arm) is exposed and mediates formation of an active receptor dimer. In this dimer the intracellular kinase domains adopt an asymmetric dimer interaction in which the C-lobe of a donor kinase contacts the N-lobe of a receiver kinase, stabilizing the active conformation of the receiver kinase (37Zhang X.

Here we report quantitative FRET measurements of homo- and hetero-interactions between near full-length EGFR and HER2 in vesicles derived from plasma membranes.

Because we are unable to distinguish dimers from higher-order oligomers (n ≥ 2) by our method we refer to oligomers rather than dimers, although single-molecule photobleaching and fluorescence intensity fluctuation studies indicate that ligand-independent EGFR oligomers are predominantly dimeric (21Nagy P.

We observe that mutations in the asymmetric kinase interface do not preclude formation of ligand-independent EGFR oligomers, indicating that an alternate conformation to the active dimer exists within the ligand-independent oligomer ensemble. To enable measurement of homo- and hetero-ERBB interactions in native cell membranes using FRET microscopy, human EGFR and HER2 variants labeled at their C termini with a fluorescent donor (EYFP) or acceptor (mCherry) protein were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. ERBBs have ∼200 amino acid disordered regions at their C termini, which, along with 8 amino acid Gly-Ser linkers inserted between each ERBB and its fluorescent protein (fp) fusion partner, are presumed to mitigate effects of fluorescent dipole orientation on observed FRET (Fig. S1) (42Evers T.H. van Dongen E.M. Faesen A.C. Meijer E.W. Merkx M. Quantitative understanding of the energy transfer between fluorescent proteins connected via flexible peptide linkers.Biochemistry. 2006; 45 (17073440): 13183-1319210.1021/bi061288tCrossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Expression levels of full-length forms of fp-tagged EGFR and HER2 proved too low to characterize interactions with confidence. EGFR and HER2 variants with C-terminal deletions were thus tested to identify minimal deletions that preserve activity and result in improved expression levels. Removal of 107 and 25 residues from the C termini of EGFR and HER2, respectively, generated the variants EGFR-Δ107-fp and HER2-Δ25-fp and resulted in proteins that express well and are functional as judged by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots (Fig. 1A). EGFR variants with a 237 amino acid C-terminal deletion are able to elicit EGF-dependent cellular functions, indicating that the region deleted in EGFR-Δ107-fp is not essential for activation of downstream effectors (43Opresko L.K.

Endogenous EGFR in vesicles derived from A431 cells retains EGF-dependent phosphorylation indicating that vesiculation does not impair ERBB function (Fig. 1C). The concentrations of donor- and acceptor-labeled ERBBs as well as the FRET efficiency between labeled ERBBs in vesicles were obtained from three fluorescence scans (Fig. 1D). Cells in the same transfection experiment display a wide range of receptor expression levels as judged by fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1B), which allows FRET efficiency to be determined as a function of receptor concentration. A wide range (roughly 10-fold) was observed for all variants tested, and the identity of the fluorescent protein (EYFP or mCherry) did not affect the variability in the observed concentration.

The FRET efficiency for EGFR-Δ107-fp increased as a function of concentration and fit well to a monomer-dimer equilibrium model, with a two-dimensional Kd of 156 molecules/μm2 (Fig. 2A and B) and a FRET efficiency value of 0.35 ± 0.06 (Table 1), consistent with previous observations (23Stoneman M.R.

https://openalex.org/W3045697904,"The use of kidneys donated after circulatory death (DCD) remains controversial due to concerns with regard to high incidences of early graft loss, delayed graft function (DGF), and impaired graft survival. As these concerns are mainly based on data from historical cohorts, they are prone to time-related effects and may therefore not apply to the current timeframe. To assess the impact of time on outcomes, we performed a time-dependent comparative analysis of outcomes of DCD and donation after brain death (DBD) kidney transplantations. Data of all 11,415 deceased-donor kidney transplantations performed in The Netherlands between 1990–2018 were collected. Based on the incidences of early graft loss, two eras were defined (1998–2008 [n = 3,499] and 2008–2018 [n = 3,781]), and potential time-related effects on outcomes evaluated. Multivariate analyses were applied to examine associations between donor type and outcomes. Interaction tests were used to explore presence of effect modification. Results show clear time-related effects on posttransplant outcomes. The 1998–2008 interval showed compromised outcomes for DCD procedures (higher incidences of DGF and early graft loss, impaired 1-year renal function, and inferior graft survival), whereas DBD and DCD outcome equivalence was observed for the 2008–2018 interval. This occurred despite persistently high incidences of DGF in DCD grafts, and more adverse recipient and donor risk profiles (recipients were 6 years older and the KDRI increased from 1.23 to 1.39 and from 1.35 to 1.49 for DBD and DCD donors). In contrast, the median cold ischaemic period decreased from 20 to 15 hours. This national study shows major improvements in outcomes of transplanted DCD kidneys over time. The time-dependent shift underpins that kidney transplantation has come of age and DCD results are nowadays comparable to DBD transplants. It also calls for careful interpretation of conclusions based on historical cohorts, and emphasises that retrospective studies should correct for time-related effects."
https://openalex.org/W3045930103,"Epizoic diatoms form an important part of micro-epibiota of marine vertebrates such as whales and sea turtles. The present study explores and compares the diversity and biogeography of diatom communities growing on the skin and shell of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from four different localities: Adriatic Sea (Croatia), Ionian Sea (Greece), South Africa and Florida Bay (USA) using both light and scanning electron microscopy. We observed almost 400 diatom taxa belonging to more than 100 genera. Diatom communities from Greece and Croatia showed the highest similarity and were statistically different from those recorded from South Africa and Florida. Part of this variation could be attributed to differences in sampling techniques; however, we believe that geography had an important role. In general, contrary to several previous observations from sea turtles, the presumably exclusively epizoic diatoms contributed less than common benthic taxa to the total diatom flora, which might have been related to the loggerhead feeding behavior. Moreover, skin samples differed from carapace samples in having a distinct diatom composition with a higher proportion of the putative true epizoonts. Our results indicate that epizoic diatom communities differ according to loggerhead geographical location and substrate (skin vs. carapace). The relative abundances of common benthic diatoms and putative exclusive epizoic taxa may inform about sea turtle habitat use or behavior though detailed comparisons among different host species have yet to be performed."

Methods Thirty-six men with chronic SCI underwent anthropometric measurements, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure total and regional adiposity. An SCI specific WC cutoff point of 86.5 cm was applied to the existing general population criteria. Pearson chi-square (χ2) analyses tested the difference in the number of participants classified as obese using the SCI specific cutoff point compared to the general population criteria. Sensitivity and specificity analyses relative to percentage body fat mass and visceral adipose tissue was used to assess classification performance of this cutoff point. The interrater reliability for three definitions of MetS was assessed using Cohen’s Kappa (κ) values. Linear regression analyses were utilized to propose SCI specific Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score (FRS) cutoff value. Results Using SCI specific WC cutoff point of 86.5 cm, 36% of participants were classified as obese compared to only 3% when using WC of 102 cm (P < 0.001). Relative to percentage body fat mass, the general population WC cutoff point of 102 cm had a sensitivity of 6.3% and specificity of 100% both which changed to 68.8% and 90%, respectively, with a SCI specific cutoff point of 86.5 cm. Similar results were obtained when using visceral adipose tissue as a reference. The Kappa (κ) values improved substantially after using SCI specific criteria (0.95 ± 0.05) compared to the general population criteria (0.47 ± 0.28) for three definitions of MetS. The SCI specific FRS cutoff value of 6 was predicted after applying a WC cutoff of 86.5 cm. Conclusions Using the existing general population criteria underestimated persons with SCI who are at risk of developing obesity, MetS, and CVD. The recommended SCI specific criteria are likely to distinguish those at risks of developing comorbidities and allow healthcare providers to intervene in a timely manner."

However, its links to rhythms of nutrient intake, energy balance, and metabolic control remain poorly defined. Using surveys of Gene Expression Omnibus data sets, we confirm that fasting suppresses liver adropin expression in lean C57BL/6J (B6) mice. However, circadian rhythm data are inconsistent. In lean mice, caloric restriction (CR) induces bouts of compulsive binge feeding separated by prolonged fasting intervals, increasing NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 signaling important for glucose and lipid metabolism regulation. CR up-regulates adropin expression and induces rhythms correlating with cellular stress-response pathways. Furthermore, adropin expression correlates positively with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxokinase-1 (Pck1) expression, suggesting a link with gluconeogenesis. Our previous data suggest that adropin suppresses gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. Liver-specific adropin knockout (LAdrKO) mice exhibit increased glucose excursions following pyruvate injections, indicating increased gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is also increased in primary cultured hepatocytes derived from LAdrKO mice. Analysis of circulating insulin levels and liver expression of fasting-responsive cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways also suggests enhanced responses in LAdrKO mice during a glucagon tolerance test (250 µg/kg intraperitoneally). Fasting-associated changes in PKA signaling are attenuated in transgenic mice constitutively expressing adropin and in fasting mice treated acutely with adropin peptide. In summary, hepatic adropin expression is regulated by nutrient- and clock-dependent extrahepatic signals. CR induces pronounced postprandial peaks in hepatic adropin expression.

However, this recommendation was conditional as the strength of evidence was not strong. We assessed risk factors for iTBD in recently-exposed adult and pediatric Indian HHC, to determine which HHC subgroups might benefit most from TPT. We prospectively enrolled consenting HHC of adult PTB patients in Pune and Chennai, India. They underwent clinical, microbiologic and radiologic screening for TB disease (TBD) and TBI, at enrollment, 4–6, 12 and 24 months. TBI testing was performed by tuberculin skin test (TST) and Quantiferon®- Gold-in-Tube (QGIT) assay. HHC without baseline TBD were followed for development of iTBI and iTBD. Using mixed-effect Poisson regression, we assessed baseline characteristics including TBI status, and incident TBI (iTBI) using several TST and/or QGIT cut-offs, as potential risk factors for iTBD. Of 1051 HHC enrolled, 42 (4%) with baseline TBD and 12 (1%) with no baseline TBI test available, were excluded. Of the remaining 997 HHC, 707 (71%) had baseline TBI (TST ≥ 5 mm or QGIT ≥ 0.35 IU/ml). Overall, 20 HHC (2%) developed iTBD (12 cases/1000 person-years, 95%CI: 8–19). HIV infection (aIRR = 29.08, 95% CI: 2.38–355.77, p = 0.01) and undernutrition (aIRR = 6.16, 95% CI: 1.89–20.03, p = 0.003) were independently associated with iTBD. iTBD was not associated with age, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol, and baseline TBI, or iTBI, regardless of TST (≥ 5 mm, ≥ 10 mm, ≥ 6 mm increase) or QGIT (≥ 0.35 IU/ml, ≥ 0.7 IU/ml) cut-offs. Given the high overall risk of iTBD among recently exposed HHCs, and the lack of association between TBI status and iTBD, our findings support the new WHO recommendation to offer TPT to all HHC of PTB patients residing in a high TB burden country such as India, and do not suggest any benefit of TBI testing at baseline or during follow-up to risk stratify recently-exposed HHC for TPT."
https://openalex.org/W3045885051,"Mathematics is often promoted as endowing those who study it with transferable skills such as an ability to think logically and critically or to have improved investigative skills, resourcefulness and creativity in problem solving. However, there is scant evidence to back up such claims. This project tested participants with increasing levels of mathematics training on 11 well-studied rational and logical reasoning tasks aggregated from various psychological studies. These tasks, that included the Cognitive Reflection Test and the Wason Selection Task, are of particular interest as they have typically and reliably eluded participants in all studies, and results have been uncorrelated with general intelligence, education levels and other demographic information. The results in this study revealed that in general the greater the mathematics training of the participant, the more tasks were completed correctly, and that performance on some tasks was also associated with performance on others not traditionally associated. A ceiling effect also emerged. The work is deconstructed from the viewpoint of adding to the platform from which to approach the greater, and more scientifically elusive, question: are any skills associated with mathematics training innate or do they arise from skills transfer?"
https://openalex.org/W3045749388,"Topical corticosteroids (TCs) are widely used to treat dermatological conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. It can be a safe and effective treatment when used appropriately. However, misguided information and corticosteroid phobia appear to contribute to inadequate adherence to therapy, leading to unsatisfactory treatment outcomes. Therefore, community pharmacists (CPs) are in a prime position to inform patients about the appropriate use of medicine. The aim of this study was to examine how the knowledge and perceptions of CPs, as well as other factors, associate CPs' patient counseling practice around the use of TCs. A structured, validated questionnaire was distributed to CPs in the Republic of Korea, and additional focus group discussions were implemented to obtain a deeper understanding of the survey findings. We analyzed the survey results by applying a modified knowledge-perception-practice model. In addition, we used path analysis to validate the model and assessed how knowledge level and perceptions of barriers affect CPs' counseling behavior. We ran a multiple regression to identify factors that associate CPs' practice levels. A total of 1018 surveys were analyzed. In general, respondents had sufficient knowledge to provide appropriate patient counseling on TC use. An increase in knowledge level positively associated the quality of practice, and more knowledge increased the perception of barriers that negatively associated patient counseling. Location in rural areas and pharmacists' perception of counseling barriers negatively associated the quality of practice. A higher level of knowledge, training in ADEs, higher proportion of OTC TC sales, and increased time for counseling positively associated the quality of practice. Therefore, minimizing barriers such as negative perceptions is very important in facilitating CPs' counseling practice around TC use."

A citizen science approach is utilized here to inform the prevalence and usage of TiO2 containing PCP on a household scale, which generates information as to the quantity of TiO2 entering the WWTP, and the portion ultimately discharged to the environment. Meanwhile, citizen science sourced inventories were generated to estimate the quantity of TiO2, and potentially nanoscale TiO2 entering the WWTP from consumer products and to determine which products had the greatest contribution. The estimated values were compared with water samples from the WWTP which quantified the amount of total titanium present using ICP-AES. These values were at a similar level with other top-down estimation approaches and suggest that a citizen science approach is valid to estimate the loading of TiO2, and potentially other emerging contaminants, while at the same time engaging with community stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W3046181451,"Overharvesting affects the size and growth of wildlife populations and can impact population trajectories. Overharvesting can also severely alter population structure and may result in changes in spatial organisation, social dynamics and recruitment. Understanding the relationship between overharvesting and population growth is therefore crucial for the recovery of exploited species. The black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis; black rhino) is a long-lived megaherbivore native to sub-Saharan Africa, listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Since 2009, the targeted illegal killing of rhino for their horns has escalated dramatically in South Africa. Given their slow life trajectories, spatial structure and social dynamics, black rhino may be susceptible to both direct and indirect impacts of overharvesting. Our study compared black rhino demography before and during extensive poaching to understand the impact of illegal killing. The population exhibited significant changes in age structure after four years of heavy poaching; these changes were primarily explained by a decrease in the proportion of calves over time. Population projections incorporating both direct poaching removals and decreased fecundity/recruitment were most similar to the observed demographic profile in 2018, suggesting that indirect impacts are also contributing to the observed population trajectory. These indirect impacts are likely a result of decreased density, through processes such as reduced mate-finding, population disturbance and/or increased calf predation. This study illustrates the combined effect of direct and indirect impacts on an endangered species, providing a more comprehensive approach by which to evaluate exploited populations."
https://openalex.org/W3046915035,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is well-known as an endogenous proinflammatory prostanoid synthesized from arachidonic acid by the activation of cyclooxygenase-2. E type prostanoid (EP) receptors are cognates for PGE2 that have four main subtypes: EP1 to EP4. Of these, the EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors have been shown to couple to Gαs-protein and can activate adenylyl cyclase to form cAMP. Studies suggest that EP4 receptors are involved in colorectal homeostasis and cancer development, but further work is needed to identify the roles of EP2 receptors in these functions. After sufficient inflammation has been evoked by PGE2, it is metabolized to 15-keto-PGE2. Thus, 15-keto-PGE2 has long been considered an inactive metabolite of PGE2. However, it may have an additional role as a biased and/or partial agonist capable of taking over the actions of PGE2 to gradually terminate reactions. Here, using cell-based experiments and in silico simulations, we show that PGE2-activated EP4 receptor–mediated signaling may evoke the primary initiating reaction of the cells, which would take over the 15-keto-PGE2–activated EP2 receptor–mediated signaling after PGE2 is metabolized to 15-keto-PGE2. The present results shed light on new aspects of 15-keto-PGE2, which may have important roles in passing on activities to EP2 receptors from PGE2-stimulated EP4 receptors as a “switched agonist.” This novel mechanism may be significant for gradually terminating PGE2-evoked inflammation and/or maintaining homeostasis of colorectal tissues/cells functions.

E-type prostanoid (EP) receptors are known as cognates for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) that have four main subtypes: EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 (1Woodward D.F. Jones R.L. Narumiya S.

Prostanoid receptors have been reported to be activated not only by their cognate ligands but also noncognate prostanoids as biased ligands (2Abramovitz M. Adam M. Boie Y. Carrière M. Denis D.

For example, we previously found that PGE1 and PGE3 are able to induce cAMP formation effectively as full agonist like PGE2, but they only partially activate β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF)-mediated signaling as partial agonists, approximately half-maximal effects/responses compared with those induced by PGE2 (4Araki Y. Suganami A. Endo S. Masuda Y. Fukushima K. Regan J.W. Murayama T. Tamura Y. Fujino H. PGE1 and E3 show lower efficacies than E2 to β-catenin-mediated activity as biased ligands of EP4 prostanoid receptors.FEBS Lett. 2017; 591 (28986997): 3771-378010.1002/1873-3468.12878Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because β-catenin/TCF–mediated signaling is well-known colorectal cancer–related signaling (5Srivastava S. Verma M. Henson D.E. Biomarkers for early detection of colon cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7 (11350874): 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar), PGE1 and PGE3 act as negative biased agonists for EP4 receptors to mediate anti-cancer effects by selectively not fully activating β-catenin/TCF–mediated signaling. These biased activities are possibly due to the different receptor conformations caused by the numbers and patterns of hydrogen-bonding formation between EP4 receptors and each PGE (4Araki Y. Suganami A. Endo S. Masuda Y. Fukushima K. Regan J.W. Murayama T. Tamura Y. Fujino H. PGE1 and E3 show lower efficacies than E2 to β-catenin-mediated activity as biased ligands of EP4 prostanoid receptors.FEBS Lett. 2017; 591 (28986997): 3771-378010.1002/1873-3468.12878Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, depending on slight structural differences, such as the numbers of double bonds, each prostanoid may activate distinct signaling as biased agonist via the same receptors. PGE2 is well-known as an endogenous proinflammatory prostanoid, which is synthesized from arachidonic acid by the activation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (6Regan J.W. EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptor signaling.Life Sci. 2003; 74 (14607241): 143-15310.1016/j.lfs.2003.09.031Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). After PGE2 has evoked sufficient inflammation, it is metabolized to 15-keto-PGE2 by the action of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase. 15-Keto-PGE2 is widely considered as an inactive form of PGE2 (7Tai H.H.

On the other hand, 15-keto-PGE2 has also been previously shown to activate and produce cAMP via Gαs-protein–coupled EP2 and EP4 receptors, although the potencies and/or efficacies are weaker than those of PGE2 (9Nishigaki N. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Two Gs-coupled prostaglandin E receptor subtypes, EP2 and EP4, differ in desensitization and sensitivity to the metabolic inactivation of the agonist.Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50 (8863851): 1031-1037PubMed Google Scholar), because this prostanoid is not able to effectively activate EP receptors (10Kishore A.H. Owens D. Word R.A.

The EP2 and EP4 receptors are, however, currently known to activate not only Gαs-protein–coupled cAMP-mediated signaling but also β-catenin/TCF-mediated signaling (6Regan J.W. EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptor signaling.Life Sci. 2003; 74 (14607241): 143-15310.1016/j.lfs.2003.09.031Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 11Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W.

Because 15-keto-PGE2 is a one-hydrogen-removed reduced form of PGE2, this prostanoid will plausibly show the activity of β-catenin/TCF–mediated signaling besides Gαs-protein–coupled cAMP-mediated signaling and could act as a biased ligand for EP2 and EP4 receptors to regulate their diverged signaling pathways. The expression levels of EP4 receptors have been reported to be higher in normal than cancerous tissues (12Yokoyama U. Iwatsubo K. Umemura M. Fujita T. Ishikawa Y. The prostanoid EP4 receptor and its signaling pathway.Pharmacol. Rev. 2013; 65 (23776144): 1010-105210.1124/pr.112.007195Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 13Takafuji V. Cosme R. Lublin D.

Normal colorectal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation have also been reported to be regulated by β-catenin/TCF–mediated signaling. Indeed, this signaling is considered to have key roles in maintaining colorectal homeostasis (15van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E.

On the other hand, PGE2 is also well-known to be involved in colorectal cancer development (1Woodward D.F. Jones R.L. Narumiya S. International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.

Thus, increases in the levels of PGE2 and COX-2 are biomarkers for the early stage of colorectal cancer development. Because the up-regulation of COX-2 expression has been reported to be associated with the activation of EP4 receptors, the signaling pathways and expression mechanisms of EP4 receptors have been extensively investigated (12Yokoyama U. Iwatsubo K. Umemura M. Fujita T. Ishikawa Y. The prostanoid EP4 receptor and its signaling pathway.Pharmacol.

As described, β-catenin/TCF–mediated signaling is a biomarker for colorectal cancer (5Srivastava S. Verma M. Henson D.E. Biomarkers for early detection of colon cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7 (11350874): 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar), and it is evoked via activation of EP4 receptors (11Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and stimulation of T-cell factor signaling following activation of EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors by prostaglandin E2.J. Biol.

Therefore, if the EP4 receptor–mediated β-catenin/TCF-regulated homeostasis systems collapse, it will lead to the early stage of colorectal cancer, possibly due to the aberrant expression of EP4 receptors followed by unrestrained induction of COX-2 and excess amounts of de novo synthesis of PGE2 (19Fujino H. The role of EP4 prostanoid receptors in cancer malignancy signaling.Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2016; 39 (26830476): 149-15510.1248/bpb.b15-00840Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Fujino H.

Meanwhile, β-catenin/TCF–mediated signaling is not only activated by EP4 receptors but also EP2 receptors (11Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and stimulation of T-cell factor signaling following activation of EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors by prostaglandin E2.J. Biol.

In collaboration with knockout mouse studies, EP2 receptors have been considered to be involved in colorectal cancer development as well (21Aoki T. Narumiya S. Prostaglandin E2-EP2 signaling as a node of chronic inflammation in the colon tumor microenvironment.Inflamm. Regen. 2017; 37 (29259703): 410.1186/s41232-017-0036-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the detailed roles of EP2 receptors in colorectal cancer development as well as in normal homeostasis are not clearly understood. Because 15-keto-PGE2 is able to bind to and has lower efficacies for EP2 and EP4 receptors than PGE2, at least in terms of cAMP formation (9Nishigaki N. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Two Gs-coupled prostaglandin E receptor subtypes, EP2 and EP4, differ in desensitization and sensitivity to the metabolic inactivation of the agonist.Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50 (8863851): 1031-1037PubMed Google Scholar), there is a possibility that 15-keto-PGE2 may take over the PGE2-evoked responses after PGE2 has been metabolized. Thus, it is plausible that 15-keto-PGE2 may play the role of attenuating and/or terminating PGE2-evoked functions. In the present study, to further estimate the role of 15-keto-PGE2 in attenuating PGE2-evoked signaling pathways, we examined the effects of 15-keto-PGE2 on each diverse signaling pathway as well as the binding affinity of EP2 or EP4 receptors. Because it is very difficult to monitor/measure the ratios of PGE2 and 15-keto-PGE2 as well as each ligand-induced signaling in regular cultured cell–based assay methods, operational model calculation, in silico analysis, and computer simulation were applied along with cell-based experiments using actual data, such as Emax values and EC50 values that were obtained by pharmacological experiments as well as IC50 values of the binding assay as provided in this study. Here we show that PGE2-activated EP4 receptor–mediated signaling may evoke the primary initiating reaction of the cells, which would take over the 15-keto-PGE2–activated EP2 receptor–mediated signaling after PGE2 is metabolized to 15-keto-PGE2. In other words, 15-keto-PGE2 may not be just an inactive metabolite of PGE2 but could act as a “switched agonist” of EP2 receptors from PGE2-activated EP4 receptors, which would mildly restore/terminate the PGE2/EP4 receptor–induced signaling for inflammatory reactions, and/or for maintaining homeostasis for colorectal cell functions. Therefore, once the EP2 receptor–mediated signaling is relatively weaker and/or the EP4 receptor–mediated signaling is persistently activated, the 15-keto-PGE2–mediated restoration/termination of signaling may not be started. The continuous PGE2-mediated signaling would evoke aberrant EP4 receptor–dominated signaling that would disrupt homeostasis and eventually lead to cancerous transformation. The EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors are well-known to couple to Gαs-protein and can activate adenylyl cyclase to form cAMP. Although the levels of receptor expression are similar (HEK-293 cells stably expressing human EP2 receptors (HEK-EP2 cells), 122.6 ± 15.90 fmol/mg of protein; HEK-293 cells stably expressing human EP4 receptors (HEK-EP4 cells), 112.4 ± 5.570 fmol/mg of protein), PGE2-stimulated cAMP formation is significantly higher in HEK-EP2 cells compared with HEK-EP4 cells (11Fujino H.

To evaluate the agonistic effects of PGE2 and its metabolite 15-keto-PGE2 (Fig. 1A), HEK-EP2 or HEK-EP4 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of PGE2 or 15-keto-PGE2 for 60 min.

Although the EC50 value of 15-keto-PGE2 in HEK-EP2 cells is ∼200 times larger than PGE2 (PGE2, 548 pm (95% confidence interval: 320–929 pm); 15-keto-PGE2, 137 nm (95% confidence interval: 110–170 nm)), the Emax values of both prostanoids were similar (PGE2, 23.2 ± 0.723 pmol; 15-keto-PGE2, 23.0 ± 0.540 pmol), indicating that 15-keto-PGE2 is able to activate EP2 receptors as a full agonist (Fig. 1B, table of EP2 receptors). However, in HEK-EP4 cells, the EC50 value of 15-keto-PGE2 was more than 2,000 times larger than that of PGE2 (PGE2, 135 pm (95% confidence interval: 69.8–261 pm); 15-keto-PGE2, 426 nm (95% confidence: 20.1–90.4 nm)), and also the Emax value of 15-keto-PGE2 was almost half that of PGE2 (PGE2, 10.7 ± 0.308 pmol; 15-keto-PGE2, 5.64 ± 0.524 pmol) (Fig. 1B, table of EP4 receptors). These results indicate that 15-keto-PGE2 may work as a partial agonist of EP4 receptors in terms of cAMP formation. We previously reported that PGE2 stimulation of HEK-EP4 cells, but not HEK-EP2 cells, can induce the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinases (ERKs) via the Gαi-protein–mediated pathway (22Fujino H. Regan J.W. EP4 prostanoid receptor coupling to a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory G protein.Mol.

Therefore, the effects of 15-keto-PGE2 on phosphorylation of ERKs were examined in HEK-EP2 and HEK-EP4 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, when HEK-EP2 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of PGE2 or 15-keto-PGE2 for 5 min, PGE2– and 15-keto-PGE2–stimulated HEK-EP2 cells showed slight increases in the phosphorylation of ERKs with Emax values of 7.65 ± 0.598 and 5.26 ± 0.824%, respectively, when compared with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced phosphorylation of ERKs as 100%. The EC50 values of PGE2 and 15-keto-PGE2–induced phosphorylation of ERKs in HEK-EP2 cells were 12.6 nm (95% confidence interval: 2.22–71.3 nm) and 53.0 nm (95% confidence interval: 682 pm to 4.11 μm), respectively. In the case of HEK-EP4 cells, the EC50 value and Emax value of PGE2-stimulated phosphorylation of ERKs were about 863 pm (95% confidence interval: 334 pm to 2.23 nm) and 53.3 ± 2.42%, respectively, when compared with a PMA-induced state as 100%, whereas those of 15-keto-PGE2–stimulated phosphorylation of ERKs were around 185 nm (95% confidence interval: 92.7–371 nm) and 36.2 ± 1.92%, respectively. These results indicate that PGE2 and 15-keto-PGE2 have little effect, if any, on phosphorylation of ERKs in HEK-EP2 cells, whereas 15-keto-PGE2 acts as a partial agonist when compared with full agonist PGE2 on the phosphorylation of ERKs in HEK-EP4 cells. We previously showed that the stimulation of HEK-EP2 cells as well as HEK-EP4 cells with PGE2 induces β-catenin–mediated TCF transcriptional activities (11Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and stimulation of T-cell factor signaling following activation of EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors by prostaglandin E2.J. Biol.

However, the EP2 receptor–activated β-catenin/TCF–mediated transcriptional activity is mainly via Gαs-protein activation, whereas the EP4 receptor–activated β-catenin/TCF–mediated activity is predominantly via Gαi-protein activation (11Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and stimulation of T-cell factor signaling following activation of EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors by prostaglandin E2.J. Biol.

Thus, the effects of 15-keto-PGE2 on β-catenin/TCF-mediated activities were examined when compared with PGE2-stimulated activities using HEK-EP2 and HEK-EP4 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, PGE2-stimulated β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activities in HEK-EP2 and HEK-EP4 cells were in a concentration-dependent manner with similar EC50 values (EP2, 123 pm (95% confidence interval: 53.7–282 pm); EP4, 65.4 pm (95% confidence interval: 30.7–139 pm)) and Emax values (EP2, 454 ± 15.2%; EP4, 471 ± 13.2%). 15-Keto-PGE2–stimulated β-catenin/TCF–mediated activities in both cell lines were essentially in a concentration-dependent manner. However, in HEK-EP2 cells, the maximal activation was 376 ± 11.9%, close to that of PGE2-stimulated activation, with an EC50 value of around 29.3 nm (95% confidence interval: 16.2–53.0 nm), whereas in HEK-EP4 cells, the Emax value of 15-keto-PGE2 was around 230 ± 21.2% with an EC50 value of about 19.5 nm (95% confidence interval: 2.35–163 nm). Therefore, in terms of β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcriptional activities, 15-keto-PGE2 functioned as a partial agonist of both EP2 and EP4 receptors, but 15-keto-PGE2 showed lower efficacy as well as potency for EP4 receptors than for EP2 receptors. Next, to examine the binding affinity of 15-keto-PGE2 for each EP2 or EP4 receptor, a competitive whole-cell radioligand binding of [3H]PGE2 assay was then performed. As shown in Fig. 2B, PGE2 and 15-keto-PGE2 caused the concentration-dependent inhibition of [3H]PGE2 binding to both HEK-EP2 and HEK-EP4 cells. The IC50 values of EP2 receptors for PGE2 and 15-keto-PGE2 were ∼2.94 nm (95% confidence interval: 1.23–7.00 nm) and 118 nm (95% confidence interval: 82.2–170 nm), respectively. The IC50 values of EP4 receptors for both prostanoids were about 434 pm (95% confidence interval: 282–668 pm) and 2.82 μm (95% confidence interval: 1.66–4.80 μm), respectively. Thus, the differences in IC50 values between PGE2 and 15-keto-PGE2 are around 100 times in HEK-EP2 cells but around 10,000 times in HEK-EP4 cells. Therefore, PGE2 may tend to bind EP4 receptors rather than EP2 receptors, whereas 15-keto-PGE2 may more easily bind to EP2 receptors than EP4 receptors. The lower potencies and efficacies of 15-keto-PGE2 for EP4 receptors in terms of cAMP formation, phosphorylation of ERKs, and β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcriptional activity could be due, at least in part, to the lower binding affinity of this prostanoid for EP4 receptors. In addition, 15-keto-PGE2 is also known to act through the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) (8Chou W.L. Chuang L.M. Chou C.C. Wang A.H.J. Lawson J.A. Ga F. Chang Z.F. Identification of a novel prostaglandin reductase reveals the involvement of prostaglandin E2 catabolism in regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16162-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar); however, treatment with 15-keto-PGE2 of parent HEK-293 cells did not evoke PPAR-response element–luciferase reporter gene activity at any concentrations (data not shown), so the effects of this prostanoid may be mediated through EP2 or EP4 receptors, but not via PPAR. We previously showed that tyrosine 196 on transmembrane 5 (TM5) and glutamate 288 on TM6 in human EP2 receptors, as well as lysine 82 on TM2, arginine 291 on TM6, and serine 307 on TM7 in human EP4 receptors, are key amino acids for ligand binding (3Suganami A.

Thus, to further examine the interactions between PGE2 or 15-keto-PGE2 and either EP2 or EP4 receptors, in silico simulations were performed. As shown in Fig. 3A, 15-keto-PGE2 was retained to form a nonclassical CH-π hydrogen bond at position 10 with the phenol ring structure of Tyr-196 in EP2 receptors, similar to PGE2. However, unlike PGE2, because position 15 of the hydroxyl functional group was oxidized to a carbonyl functional group, the hydrogen bond was not formed to 15-keto-PGE2 with Glu-288 in EP2 receptors. As we discussed previously, PGE2 forms a CH-π hydrogen bond with the EP2 receptor, resulting in a stable cognate receptor for PGE2 because the CH-π bonds do not form with PGD2 or PGF2α (3Suganami A.

https://openalex.org/W3045521841,"Abstract KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a major lung cancer subtype that leads to many cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although numerous studies on KRAS-mutant type NSCLC have been conducted, new oncogenic or tumor suppressive genes need to be detected because a large proportion of NSCLC patients does not respond to currently used therapeutics. Here, we show the tumor-promoting function of a cell cycle-related protein, PIERCE1, in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Mechanistically, PIERCE1 depletion inhibits cell growth and AKT phosphorylation (pAKT) at S473, which is particularly observed in KRAS-mutant lung cancers. Analyses of AKT-related genes using microarray, immunoblotting, and real-time quantitative PCR indicated that PIERCE1 negatively regulates the gene expression of the AKT suppressor, TRIB3, through the CHOP pathway, which is a key regulatory pathway for TRIB3 expression. Similarly, in vivo analyses of PIERCE1 depletion in the KRAS mutation-related lung cancer mouse models revealed the suppressive effect of PIERCE1 knockout in urethane- and KRAS G12D -induced lung tumorigenesis with decreased pAKT levels observed in the tumors. Tissue microarrays of human lung cancers indicated the expression of PIERCE1 in 83% of lung cancers and its correlation with pAKT expression. Thus, we illustrate how PIERCE1 depletion may serve as a therapeutic strategy against KRAS-mutant NSCLC and propose the clinical benefit of PIERCE1."

The wounds were divided in two groups based on the phase of healing: wounds with an incomplete (ICGB) or a complete granulation bed (CGB). The wound area was expressed as percentage of the wound area at day 0 and defined as relative wound area. The mean relative wound area decreased faster in probiotic than saline treated wounds. The difference was most obvious in CGB and increased rapidly from day 0 until day 12 up to 30%, and stabilized around 25% thereafter until the end of the observation period, but it was not statistically significant because of the large variation within the treatment groups. The mean wound area of CGB decreased to 28.4% (range: 6.3 to 49.3) with probiotic and to 51.9% (range: 29.3 to 81.7) with saline treatment at day 24. Additionally, the rate to 50% healing in CGB was 3.4 faster with probiotic compared to saline treatment, whereas in ICGB this was 1.9 faster. Topical probiotics did not increase serum amyloid A and white blood cell counts. Although the mentioned differences were not statistically significant, the clinical relevance of the effect of treatment with probiotics in CGB wounds is clear, supported by the differences in mean wound area in course of time and the time required to reach 50% healing (day 12 for probiotic vs more than day 24 for saline treated wounds). Thus the probiotic treated wounds reached 50% reduction in wound area in half of the time of the saline treated wounds. The topical use of probiotics can be considered as safe as it did not cause a systemic effect."

NEU1 is deficient in the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease sialidosis, and its targeting to and stability in lysosomes strictly depend on PPCA. In contrast, β-Gal only partially depends on PPCA, prompting us to investigate the role that β-Gal plays in the multienzyme complex.

A regimen of intermittent enzyme replacement therapy dosing with rhβ-Gal, followed by enzyme withdrawal, is sufficient to augment β-Gal activity levels in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts without promoting NEU1 deficiency. In the absence of β-Gal, NEU1 levels are elevated in the GM1 gangliosidosis mouse brain, which are restored to normal levels following weekly intracerebroventricular dosing with rhβ-Gal.

Currently, no safe and effective treatment has yet been developed for GM1 gangliosidosis. A challenge for developing an effective enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or gene therapy approach for GM1 gangliosidosis is that β-Gal has been reported to exist as a multienzyme complex in lysosomes with the chaperone protein, protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA), and neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) (1Bonten E.J. Annunziata I. d'Azzo A. Lysosomal multienzyme complex: pros and cons of working together.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71 (24337808): 2017-203210.1007/s00018-013-1538-3Google Scholar). Although NEU1 is strictly dependent upon PPCA for trafficking from the Golgi to late endosomes and for catalytic activation in lysosomes, β-Gal is only partially dependent on PPCA (1Bonten E.J.

We have recently demonstrated that recombinant human β-Gal (rhβ-Gal) produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells exhibits pH-dependent dynamic self-association, with the enzyme more likely being a homogenous dimer under acidic conditions, which helps to increase its thermostability (8Chen J.C.

Our study also suggests that prolonged lentiviral-mediated GLB1 overexpression leads to accumulation of β-Gal in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts in a prelysosomal compartment, presumably at neutral pH, which coincides with activation of an unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (8Chen J.C.

This gene therapy approach to augment β-Gal levels in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts also results in overnormalization of the mature form of the enzyme in lysosomes (8Chen J.C. Luu A.R.

However, it remains unknown whether chronically overnormalizing β-Gal levels in GM1 gangliosidosis patient lysosomes impacts directly on the PPCA–NEU1–β-Gal multienzyme complex and the activities of each enzyme. Here, we hypothesized that overnormalizing β-Gal levels in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts may have the potential to displace NEU1 from the PPCA-containing multienzyme complex and promote secondary NEU1 deficiency. First, we tested an ERT approach, in which we monitored cell surface receptor–mediated endocytosis of purified rhβ-Gal and its delivery to lysosomes in primary cultures of skin fibroblasts. We compared this ERT approach with a lentiviral-mediated gene therapy approach to constitutively overexpress human GLB1 cDNA, with transcription driven from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (LV–CMV–GLB1). We found that continuous ERT with rhβ-Gal or sustained GLB1 overexpression both have the potential to promote a sustained secondary NEU1 deficiency in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts. Given that NEU1 deficiency is associated with the related degenerative lysosomal storage disease sialidosis, we developed an intermittent ERT dosing regimen in GM1 gangliosidosis patient cells and in a mouse model of the disease to safely augment β-Gal levels without promoting secondary NEU1 deficiency. Collectively, our results suggest that β-Gal acts as negative regulator of NEU1 activity by displacing the labile sialidase from the PPCA chaperone in lysosomes. We have previously demonstrated that research-grade rhβ-Gal produced in CHO cells and purified in our laboratory exhibits CI-MPR–dependent cellular uptake in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts (8Chen J.C.

In this study we also characterized the glycan profile of a commercial source of rhβ-Gal–His6 (R&D Systems) and compared this with our research-grade rhβ-Gal produced and purified in-house (8Chen J.C. Luu A.R. Wise N. De Angelis R. Agrawal V. Mangini L. Vincelette J. Handyside B. Sterling H. Lo M.J. Wong H. Galicia N. Pacheco G. Van Vleet J.

Chem. 2020; 295 (31481471): 13532-1355510.1074/jbc.RA119.009811Google Scholar). N-Linked oligosaccharide profiling of peptide N-glycosidase F–digested glycans by capillary zone electrophoresis demonstrate that commercial rhβ-Gal–His6 produced in CHO cells or rhβ-Gal produced and purified in our laboratory contains multiple glycan moieties (Fig. 1, A and B, black traces). Some of the glycans present on both enzymes can be digested to nonphosphorylated glycans after treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1, A and B, blue traces). Both enzyme preparations contain similar amounts of bis-phosphorylated oligomannose (BPM7) and mono-phosphorylated oligomannose (Fig. 1, A and B). The overall amount of phosphorylated oligomannose present on commercial rhβ-Gal–His6 and in-house purified rhβ-Gal corresponds to 2.1 and 1.5 mol/mol of enzyme, respectively (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that both enzyme preparations contain similar amounts of phosphorylated oligomannose, the preferred glycan species for cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR)–dependent cellular uptake and lysosomal targeting. Newly synthesized β-Gal has been reported to undergo a C-terminal proteolytic maturation step in lysosomes, releasing a ∼20-kDa proteolytic fragment, a process that can be monitored by Western blotting and used as an indicator of enzyme delivery to lysosomes (8Chen J.C. Luu A.R. Wise N. De Angelis R. Agrawal V. Mangini L. Vincelette J. Handyside B. Sterling H. Lo M.J. Wong H. Galicia N. Pacheco G. Van Vleet J.

Chem. 2020; 295 (31481471): 13532-1355510.1074/jbc.RA119.009811Google Scholar). No mutant β-Gal protein can be detected in primary skin fibroblasts established from an infantile-onset GM1 gangliosidosis patient by Western blotting (GM05653; Fig. 1D). Following cellular uptake for 24 h in normal and GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts, the majority of internalized commercial rhβ-Gal–His6 is detected by Western blotting as a cleaved molecule of similar size to the endogenous mature lysosomal form of β-Gal detected in untreated normal fibroblasts (GM08399; Fig. 1D), with only a small amount of the precursor enzyme being detected (Fig. 1D). This would suggest that the majority of internalized commercial rhβ-Gal–His6 is being rapidly delivered to lysosomes and converted to the mature lysosomal species following cellular uptake in both cell lines. Appearance of the mature lysosomal rhβ-Gal–His6 species can be completely abolished in the presence of mannose-6-phosphate (Man6P; Fig. 1D), a known inhibitor of CI-MPR–dependent cellular uptake (Fig. 1D). CI-MPR–mediated cellular uptake of commercial rhβ-Gal–His6 in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts is sufficient to increase β-Gal protein levels to levels that are comparable with endogenous β-Gal protein levels present in control fibroblasts from a normal individual, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, cellular uptake of commercial rhβ-Gal–His6 or rhβ-Gal in normal fibroblasts results in β-Gal augmentation by only 1.56- and 2.67-fold above normal endogenous β-Gal activity levels, respectively (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these results suggest that our in-house purified rhβ-Gal (8Chen J.C. Luu A.R. Wise N. De Angelis R. Agrawal V. Mangini L. Vincelette J. Handyside B. Sterling H. Lo M.J. Wong H.

Furthermore, the limited cellular uptake capacity for rhβ-Gal–His6 and rhβ-Gal in normal fibroblasts differs from other purified lysosomal enzymes utilizing the CI-MPR pathway, where overnormalization of lysosomal enzyme activity by severalfold above normal can be achieved (9Yogalingam G.

Annunziata I. d'Azzo A. Lysosomal multienzyme complex: pros and cons of working together.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71 (24337808): 2017-203210.1007/s00018-013-1538-3Google Scholar). In PPCA-deficient galactosialidosis patient cells, NEU1 is strictly dependent upon PPCA for delivery to lysosomes and activation in lysosomes, thus giving rise to secondary NEU1 deficiency in the absence of PPCA (Fig. 2A) (1Bonten E.J. Annunziata I. d'Azzo A. Lysosomal multienzyme complex: pros and cons of working together.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71 (24337808): 2017-203210.1007/s00018-013-1538-3Google Scholar, 6Bonten E.J.

In contrast, β-Gal is partially dependent upon PPCA for stability in lysosomes, giving rise to only partial β-Gal deficiency in the absence of PPCA in galactosialidosis patient cells (Fig. 2A) (10Zhou X.Y.

To determine whether the limited cellular uptake potential of rhβ-Gal–His6 in fibroblasts (Fig. 1E) is related to its dependence upon the multienzyme complex in lysosomes, we measured the cellular uptake and decay of lysosomal-delivered rhβ-Gal–His6 in GM1 gangliosidosis fibroblasts, normal fibroblasts, and PPCA-deficient galactosialidosis patient fibroblasts. The cellular uptake capacity of rhβ-Gal–His6 over 24 h is partially reduced in PPCA-deficient galactosialidosis fibroblasts (GM21262; Vmax = 2647 nmol/h/mg; Fig. 2B), when compared with GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts (GM05653; Vmax = 5484 nmol/h/mg; Fig. 2B) and WT fibroblasts (GM08399; Vmax = 4550 nmol/h/mg; Fig. 2B). The partial cellular uptake capacity of rhβ-Gal–His6 in galactosialidosis cells can be increased to normal levels, when galactosialidosis fibroblasts are preloaded with rhPPCA–His6 for 24 h prior to enzyme uptake (Vmax = 5265 nmol/h/mg; Fig. 2B). Following 24 h of cellular uptake, lysosome-delivered rhβ-Gal–His6 enzyme activity decays rapidly in PPCA-deficient galactosialidosis patient fibroblasts over a period of 40 days, with a t1/2 corresponding to 0.5 days (Fig. 2C). In contrast, rhβ-Gal–His6 stability is increased to 10 days in galactosialidosis patient fibroblasts preloaded with rhPPCA–His6 for 24 h, prior to performing the t1/2 experiment (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these experiments with PPCA-deficient galactosialidosis patient skin fibroblasts suggest that rhβ-Gal–His6 cellular uptake and stability in lysosomes is partially dependent upon PPCA and cannot be overnormalized. These results are in agreement with those of Zhou et al. (10Zhou X.Y. Morreau H. Rottier R. Davis D. Bonten E. Gillemans N. Wenger D. Grosveld F.G. Doherty P. Suzuki K. Grosveld G.C. d'Azzo A.

Previous studies have demonstrated that NEU1 is strictly dependent upon its association with chaperone PPCA protein for its trafficking to lysosomes and stability (1Bonten E.J. Annunziata I. d'Azzo A. Lysosomal multienzyme complex: pros and cons of working together.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71 (24337808): 2017-203210.1007/s00018-013-1538-3Google Scholar, 6Bonten E.J.

Annunziata I. d'Azzo A. Lysosomal multienzyme complex: pros and cons of working together.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71 (24337808): 2017-203210.1007/s00018-013-1538-3Google Scholar, 10Zhou X.Y.

These observations led us to speculate that β-Gal mediates additional, novel roles in regulation of the multienzyme complex. A series of add-back experiments in PPCA-deficient galactosialidosis patient fibroblasts were designed to evaluate the role of β-Gal in the multienzyme complex. As expected, in the absence of PPCA, untreated galactosialidosis cells completely lack NEU1 activity (Fig. 3B). Cellular uptake of rhβ-Gal–His6 alone in galactosialidosis fibroblasts results in a dose-dependent increase in β-Gal activity, which is increased further in cells preloaded with rhPPCA–His6 (Fig. 3A). This result is not surprising in light of the partial dependence of β-Gal on PPCA for its stability in lysosomes (Fig. 2C) (1Bonten E.J. Annunziata I. d'Azzo A. Lysosomal multienzyme complex: pros and cons of working together.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71 (24337808): 2017-203210.1007/s00018-013-1538-3Google Scholar, 10Zhou X.Y. Morreau H. Rottier R. Davis D.

Cellular uptake of rhβ-Gal–His6 in galactosialidosis patient fibroblasts does not augment NEU1 activity levels (Fig. 3B), suggesting that β-Gal does not positively regulate NEU1. In galactosialidosis patient fibroblasts preloaded with rhPPCA–His6, NEU1 activity levels are rescued close to NEU1 levels detected in fibroblasts from a normal individual (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we show that this rescued NEU1 activity can be competitively reduced following endocytosis with increasing concentrations of rhβ-Gal–His6 (Fig. 3B). Given that NEU1 is strictly dependent upon its association with PPCA for its activation, one can presume that increasing concentrations of lysosome-delivered rhβ-Gal–His6 in galactosialidosis patient fibroblasts are directly or indirectly competing with and displacing the rescued NEU1 from PPCA. There are several lines of evidence to support a dynamic state, rather than a static state for the multienzyme complex. Bonten et al. (6Bonten E.J. Campos Y. Zaitsev V. Nourse A. Waddell B. Lewis W. Taylor G. d'Azzo A. Heterodimerization of the sialidase NEU1 with the chaperone protective protein/cathepsin A prevents its premature oligomerization.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19666471): 28430-2844110.1074/jbc.M109.031419Google Scholar) have reported that NEU1 exhibits weak self-association at acidic pH, which leads to its instability and rapid degradation, whereas association with PPCA leads to stable, long-lived PPCA-NEU1 heterodimers (6Bonten E.J. Campos Y. Zaitsev V. Nourse A. Waddell B. Lewis W. Taylor G. d'Azzo A. Heterodimerization of the sialidase NEU1 with the chaperone protective protein/cathepsin A prevents its premature oligomerization.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19666471): 28430-2844110.1074/jbc.M109.031419Google Scholar). In contrast to NEU1, our biophysical studies with rhβ-Gal suggest that β-Gal exhibits dynamic self-association and instability at neutral pH, with the enzyme being more stable as a dimer at acidic pH (8Chen J.C. Luu A.R. Wise N. De Angelis R. Agrawal V. Mangini L. Vincelette J. Handyside B. Sterling H. Lo M.J. Wong H. Galicia N. Pacheco G. Van Vleet J. Giaramita A. et al.Intracerebroventricular enzyme replacement therapy with β-galactosidase reverses brain pathologies due to GM1 gangliosidosis in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295 (31481471): 13532-1355510.1074/jbc.RA119.009811Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that β-Gal plays a previously undescribed role in the PPCA–NEU1–β-Gal multienzyme complex, where it competes with NEU1 in a concentration-dependent manner for association with PPCA and thereby has the potential to negatively regulate sialidase levels (Fig. 3, A and B; see also Fig. 8 for a summary). Our add-back studies in PPCA-deficient galactosialidosis fibroblasts (Fig. 3) suggest that β-Gal augmentation therapy has the potential to displace NEU1 from PPCA and promote secondary NEU1 deficiency. Because NEU1 deficiency is associated with the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease, sialidosis, we evaluated the potential for β-Gal augmentation therapy to promote secondary NEU1 deficiency in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts. Chronic cellular uptake of rhβ-Gal–His6 in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts over 1 week restores β-Gal activity (Fig. 4A), which coincides with a dose-dependent reduction in NEU1 activity levels (Fig. 4B). The highest concentration of rhβ-Gal–His6 cellular uptake tested (200 nm) coincides with almost complete loss of NEU1 activity (Fig. 4B), with the levels of NEU1 activity corresponding to 3% of normal NEU1 activity detected in fibroblasts from a normal individual (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, preloading GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts with rhPPCA–His6 does not further increase the uptake capacity of rhβ-Gal–His6 (Fig. 4A) or prevent secondary NEU1 reduction (Fig. 4B), suggesting that factors other than PPCA are required to augment β-Gal levels in GM1 gangliosidosis patient lysosomes (Fig. 4A) and prevent secondary NEU1 deficiency (Fig. 4B). Previous studies have suggested that the recycling time for the CI-MPR back to the cell surface for subsequent rounds of lysosomal enzyme targeting to be ∼15 min (11Cardone M. Porto C. Tarallo A. Vicinanza M. Rossi B. Polishchuk E. Donaudy F. Andria G. De Matteis M.A. Parenti G. Abnormal mannose-6-phosphate receptor trafficking impairs recombinant α-glucosidase uptake in Pompe disease fibroblasts.Pathogenetics. 2008; 1 (19046416): 610.1186/1755-8417-1-6Google Scholar), whereas we have previously shown that the rate of lysosomal-delivered β-Gal decay is much slower, with a t1/2 of ∼9 days (8Chen J.C. Luu A.R. Wise N. De Angelis R. Agrawal V. Mangini L. Vincelette J. Handyside B. Sterling H. Lo M.J. Wong H. Galicia N. Pacheco G. Van Vleet J. Giaramita A. et al.Intracerebroventricular enzyme replacement therapy with β-galactosidase reverses brain pathologies due to GM1 gangliosidosis in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295 (31481471): 13532-1355510.1074/jbc.RA119.009811Google Scholar). Therefore, with continuous exposure of GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts to rhβ-Gal over prolonged periods of time, the rate of β-Gal cellular uptake and delivery to lysosomes is likely to exceed the rate of β-Gal degradation, resulting in a net overall accumulation of β-Gal in lysosomes (Fig. 4A). To avoid inducing secondary NEU1 deficiency, we therefore developed an intermittent ERT dosing regimen to deliver a single pulsatile dose of rhβ-Gal–His6 to lysosomes of GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts, followed by a 1-week chase in the absence of enzyme. Cellular uptake with rhβ-Gal–His6 for 24 h, followed by enzyme withdrawal and a 1-week chase, is sufficient to augment β-Gal activity in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts (Fig. 4A) without promoting secondary NEU1 deficiency (Fig. 4B). Collectively, our results suggest that chronic cellular uptake and delivery of β-Gal to lysosomes coincides with secondary NEU"

Visual predators such as corvids and egg-eating raptors, are among the most common causes of nest failure; thus, parental strategies that reduce the risk of visual nest predation should be favored by selection. To date, most research has focused on egg crypsis without considering adult crypsis, although in natural circumstances the eggs are covered by an incubating parent most of the time. Here we use a ground-nesting shorebird, the Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) as model species to experimentally test whether decoy parents influence nest predation. Using artificial nests with a male decoy, a female decoy or no decoy, we found that the presence of a decoy increased nest predation (N = 107 nests, p < 0.001). However, no difference was found in predation rates between nests with a male versus female decoy (p > 0.05). Additionally, we found that nests in densely vegetated habitats experienced higher survival compared to nests placed in sparsely vegetated habitats. Nest camera images, predator tracks and marks left on eggs identified the brown-necked raven (Corvus ruficollis) as the main visual nest predator. Our study suggests that the presence of incubating parents may enhance nest detectability to visual predators. However, parents may reduce the predation risk by placing a nest in sites where they are covered by vegetation. Our findings highlight the importance of nest site selection not only regarding egg crypsis but also considering incubating adult camouflage."

Structural studies show that many such PrAMPs bind deep in the peptide exit channel of the ribosome, near the peptidyl transfer center. Biochemical studies of the particular synthetic PrAMP oncocin112 (Onc112) suggest that on reaching the cytoplasm, the peptide occupies its binding site prior to the transition from initiation to the elongation phase of translation, thus blocking further initiation events. We present a superresolution fluorescence microscopy study of the long-term effects of Onc112 on ribosome, elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu), and DNA spatial distributions and diffusive properties in intact Escherichia coli cells. The new data corroborate earlier mechanistic inferences from studies in vitro. Comparisons with the diffusive behavior induced by the ribosome-binding antibiotics chloramphenicol and kasugamycin show how the specific location of each agent's ribosomal binding site affects the long-term distribution of ribosomal species between 30S and 50S subunits versus 70S polysomes. Analysis of the single-step displacements from ribosome and EF-Tu diffusive trajectories before and after Onc112 treatment suggests that the act of codon testing of noncognate ternary complexes (TCs) at the ribosomal A-site enhances the dissociation rate of such TCs from their L7/L12 tethers.

Testing and rejection of noncognate TCs on a sub-ms timescale is essential to enable incorporation of the rare cognate amino acids into the growing peptide chain at a rate of ∼20 aa/s. Most antibiotics currently in use against bacterial infections disable a specific essential cellular mechanism, such as translation (e.g. erythromycin), transcription (rifampicin), membrane biosynthesis (penicillin), or DNA replication (ciprofloxacin) (1Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J.

As a result, localized mutations in the targeted species often develop resistance. As harmful bacteria become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, there is a critical need to develop new antibacterial agents. A promising class of compounds is the large family of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), part of the innate immune response of a wide variety of organisms, including humans (2Brogden K.A.

The first step in the attack of most cationic AMPs is the permeabilization of the membrane(s) of Gram-negative or Gram-positive species (2Brogden K.A.

In general, on gaining access to the bacterial cytoplasm, AMPs subsequently disrupt a variety of cellular processes (6Zhu Y. Mohapatra S. Weisshaar J.C.

Intriguingly, the subclass known as proline-rich AMPs (PrAMPs) evidently attack and kill Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli without permeabilizing the membranes (8Casteels P. Tempst P.

At low concentrations near the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the PrAMPs primarily use a “Trojan horse” mechanism to enter the bacterial cell via the SbmA transporter or one of its homologs (9Graf M.

SbmA resides in the cytoplasmic membrane of some Gram-negative species and imports the highly cationic PrAMPs into the cytoplasm using the proton motive force. Once they have entered the cytoplasm, the PrAMPs target 70S ribosomes. No homolog of the SbmA transporter occurs in eukaryotic cells. In addition, multiple studies have shown that PrAMPs are potent mostly against the bacterial 70S ribosomes and not the eukaryotic ribosomes (13Seefeldt A.C. Graf M. Pérébaskine N. Nguyen F. Arenz S.

The structures showed that Onc112 binds deep within the peptide exit channel and extends into the peptidyl transferase center, where it overlaps what would be the binding site of an incoming aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) at the ribosomal A-site (Fig. 1a). From this structure and from biochemical experiments (18Seefeldt A.C. Nguyen F. Antunes S. Pérébaskine N. Graf M. Arenz S. Inampudi K.K. Douat C. Guichard G. Wilson D.N. Innis C.A.

The suggestion is that Onc112 enters the ribosome through an empty peptide exit channel; i.e. Onc112 must bind before elongation has begun to fill the exit channel with growing peptide and thus block the Onc112 binding site (18Seefeldt A.C. Nguyen F. Antunes S. Pérébaskine N. Graf M. Arenz S. Inampudi K.K. Douat C. Guichard G. Wilson D.N. Innis C.A.

Biol. 2015; 22 (25984971): 470-47510.1038/nsmb.3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Ribosomes bearing Onc112 stall at the initiation site and cannot transition to peptide elongation. Additional experiments using a short, dicistronic mRNA suggested that binding of Onc112 also destabilizes the initiation complex itself, presumably because of spatial overlap between Onc112 and the fMet moiety of the fMet-tRNAfMet bound in the P-site (18Seefeldt A.C. Nguyen F. Antunes S. Pérébaskine N. Graf M. Arenz S. Inampudi K.K. Douat C. Guichard G. Wilson D.N. Innis C.A. The proline-rich antimicrobial peptide Onc112 inhibits translation by blocking and destabilizing the initiation complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 (25984971): 470-47510.1038/nsmb.3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Ribosomes can still assemble as 70S initiation complexes on the mRNA, but with decreased stability. This is somewhat reminiscent of the behavior of certain ribosome-targeting antibiotics such as chloramphenicol (Cam), kasugamycin (Ksg), and many others. Cam binds the 70S ribosome at the A-site crevice near the exit channel, hindering the binding of an incoming aa-tRNA to the A-site (Fig. 1a) (20Bulkley D. Innis C.A. Blaha G. Steitz T.A. Revisiting the structures of several antibiotics bound to the bacterial ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unlike Onc112, Cam can bind to elongating ribosomes, not only to initiation complexes (21Bakshi S. Choi H. Mondal J. Weisshaar J.C. Time-dependent effects of transcription- and translation-halting drugs on the spatial distributions of the E. coli chromosome and ribosomes.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94 (25250841): 871-88710.1111/mmi.12805Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cam potentially blocks elongation by all 70S ribosomes. In another example, Ksg binds to the mRNA path within the 30S subunit, overlapping both the E-site and P-site (Fig. 1a) (22Schluenzen F. Takemoto C. Wilson D.N. Kaminishi T. Harms J.M.

Ksg prevents binding of fMet-tRNAfMet and also blocks the E-site to prevent elongation. Thus, Ksg halts the initiation step and prevents the onset of elongation (22Schluenzen F. Takemoto C.

We have also previously studied the dynamics of different components of the translation machinery (28Bakshi S. Choi H. Weisshaar J.C.

We have shown using diffusion analysis that multiple EF-Tus can bind to the C-terminal domain of the L7/L12 stalk of ribosomes, thereby increasing their local concentration to expedite the search for a cognate ternary complex (TC). We have also measured the upper limit of the time spent by a near-cognate or non-cognate ternary complex bound to the L7/L12 stalk, which is ∼1 ms (30Mustafi M. Weisshaar J.C. Simultaneous binding of multiple EF-Tu copies to translating ribosomes in live Escherichia coli.mBio. 2018; 9: e0214310.1128/mBio.02143-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Two-state diffusion analysis of ribosomes show that the majority of them remain in a polysome state (30Mustafi M. Weisshaar J.C.

In this study, we quantitatively characterize the long-term effects of Onc112 on the spatial distributions of ribosomes, EF-Tu, and the chromosomal DNA in intact E. coli cells. We also compare the effects of Onc112, Cam, and Ksg on the diffusive behavior of the same cytoplasmic components. The results help to corroborate earlier mechanistic inferences from in vitro studies and provide new biophysical insight into their effects on the overall condition of the E. coli cytoplasm. Onc112 and Ksg, both of which block transitions to the elongation phase of translation, have very similar effects on ribosome diffusion, increasing the average diffusion coefficient by a factor of 2. Cam, which can halt translation by 70S ribosomes during the elongation phase, has a minor effect on the average ribosome diffusion coefficient. All three treatments decrease the average EF-Tu diffusion coefficient by a factor of 1.3–1.6. These results correlate well with information from the earlier structural studies of the Onc112-, Ksg-, and Cam-specific binding sites within the ribosome (20Bulkley D. Innis C.A. Blaha G. Steitz T.A. Revisiting the structures of several antibiotics bound to the bacterial ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The antibiotic kasugamycin mimics mRNA nucleotides to destabilize tRNA binding and inhibit canonical translation initiation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13 (16998488): 871-87810.1038/nsmb1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, analysis of the single-step displacement probability distributions from ribosome and EF-Tu diffusive trajectories suggests that the act of codon testing of noncognate TCs at the ribosomal A-site enhances the dissociation rate of such TCs from their L7/L12 tethers. This enables sufficiently rapid codon testing to keep up with the very fast elongation rate of ribosomes in good growth conditions. Based on our data, we have proposed a scheme of how Onc112 affects the translation process (Fig. 1b) and how this mechanism differs from that of Cam (Fig. 1c). The MIC of Onc112 over 6 h in EZ rich defined medium (EZRDM) at 30 °C is 1 μm (Fig. S7) (16Knappe D. Kabankov N. Hoffmann R. Bactericidal oncocin derivatives with superior serum stabilities.Int. J.

To directly observe slowing and halting of growth, we plated WT VH1000 cells on a poly-l-lysine–coated coverslip enclosed by a microfluidic chamber. Such cells grow normally in a flow of fresh, aerated EZRDM. At t = 0, we initiated flow of a constant concentration of Onc112 in EZRDM and monitored cell length versus time, determined from phase contrast images by the program Fiji (32Schindelin J. Arganda-Carreras I. Frise E. Kaynig V. Longair M. Pietzsch T. Preibisch S. Rueden C. Saalfeld S. Schmid B. Tinevez J.Y. White D.J. Hartenstein V. Eliceiri K. Tomancak P. et al.Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 (22743772): 676-68210.1038/nmeth.2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (30534) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2a, we plot L(t)/L0, the cell length as a function of time normalized to the length at t = 0 and averaged over 10–23 cells for different concentrations of Onc112. For all concentrations, the plots begin to curve downward at t ∼ 5 min after the onset of Onc112 flow. The higher the concentration of Onc112, the sooner cell length begins to plateau. For 5 μm and higher concentrations, the effect on cell growth is similar. To test for evidence of outer membrane disruption by Onc112 in our conditions, we applied 20 μm solution of Onc112 to cells expressing GFP with a tag directing transport to the periplasm (strain JCW10, Table S1). We have used 20 μm solution of Onc112 (20 × MIC) for most of our microscope-based experiments. Such a high concentration was used to ensure that essentially all of the cells were affected by Onc112 prior to observation by fluorescence microscopy. Sytox Orange was also added to the flowing medium with a final concentration of 5 nm. In our standard assay for cell growth and for outer and cytoplasmic membrane permeabilization to GFP and Sytox Orange (26Sochacki K.A. Barns K.J. Bucki R. Weisshaar J.C. Real-time attack on single Escherichia coli cells by the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We saw no evidence of membrane permeabilization to GFP and Sytox Orange, at least up to Onc112 concentrations of 20 μm over a period of 55 min (Fig. S1). The phase contrast images remain stable at least up to Onc112 concentrations of 20 μm over a period of 45 min, indicating little or no loss of cytoplasmic components. For multiple AMPs in the past, a sharp decrease in cell length with the injection of the peptide has been observed (8Casteels P. Tempst P. Apidaecin-type peptide antibiotics function through a non-poreforming mechanism involving stereospecificity.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

There is no evidence of such cell shrinkage or of membrane disruption in our conditions. For these experiments, cells were grown to the exponential phase (optical density (OD) ∼ 0.2–0.4) in EZRDM in culture tubes at 30 °C. At that point we added Onc112 to 20 μm (20 × MIC) final concentration and incubated the culture for an additional 30–40 min before plating the cells for fluorescence microscopy.

The gene modifications are made on the chromosome, so that all copies of the protein of interest carry the label. The doubling times of WT, MSG196, and tufAB strains in EZRDM at 30 °C are 45 ± 2 min, 49 ± 2 min, and 60 ± 3 min, respectively. Labeling of the S2 protein has only a minor effect on cell growth, whereas labeling of the protein EF-Tu causes a moderate growth defect of ∼33%. Fig. 2b compares the length distribution of cells growing normally in EZRDM with that of cells treated with 20 μm Onc112 for 30–40 min. The distribution of the treated cells is shifted toward smaller lengths, consistent with slowing and then halting of growth. To detect rapidly diffusing species on the same footing as slowly diffusing species, we imaged single molecules at 2 ms/frame. In each camera frame we maintained a low density of photoactivated mEos2, with zero, one, or two copies/cell. The resulting single-molecule trajectories are short, averaging only about three camera frames. For untreated cells in exponential growth, the S2 protein is essentially always incorporated into a complete 30S ribosomal subunit. However, the 30S subunits we track may occur as freely diffusing 30S copies searching for translation initiation sites or as 30S subunits incorporated into translating 70S ribosomes, typically part of a 70S-polysome chain (28Bakshi S.

https://openalex.org/W3046216938,"Ancient organic remains are essential for the reconstruction of past human lifeways and environments but are only preserved under particular conditions. Recent findings indicate that such conditions are becoming rarer and that archaeological sites with previously good preservation, are deteriorating. To investigate this, we returned to the well-known Swedish Mesolithic site Ageröd I. Here we present the result of the re-excavation and the osteological analyses of the bone remains from the 1940s, 1970s and 2019 excavation campaigns of the site, to document and quantify changes in bone preservation and relate them to variations in soil conditions and on-site topography. The results indicate that the bone material has suffered from accelerated deterioration during the last 75 years. This has led to heavily degraded remains in some areas and complete destruction in others. We conclude that while Ageröd can still be considered an important site, it has lost much of the properties that made it unique. If no actions are taken to secure its future preservation, the site will soon lose the organic remains that before modern encroachment and climate change had been preserved for 9000 years. Finally, because Ageröd has not been subjected to more or heavier encroachment than most other archaeological sites, our results also raise questions of the state of organic preservation in other areas and call for a broad examination of our most vulnerable hidden archaeological remains."

Twelve well-trained athletes were randomly allocated traditional resistance training (TRAD, n = 6), or resistance training using augmented eccentric loading (AEL, n = 6). A further 5 full-time, professional sprint track cyclists from a senior national squad programme also trained with augmented eccentric loading (AEL-ATH) alongside their usual sport-specific training. Participants completed four weeks of twice-weekly resistance training using the leg press exercise. In TRAD the lowering phase of the lift was set relative to concentric strength. In AEL and AEL-ATH the lowering phase was individualised to eccentric strength. Concentric, eccentric, isometric and coupled eccentric-concentric leg press strength, and back squat 1 repetition maximum (1RM), were assessed pre- and post-training. The AEL and AEL-ATH groups performed the eccentric phase with an average 26 ± 4% greater load across the programme. All groups experienced increases in concentric (5%, 7% and 3% for TRAD, AEL & AEL-ATH respectively), eccentric (7%, 11% and 6% for TRAD, AEL & AEL-ATH respectively), and squat 1RM (all p < 0.05), where the AEL-ATH group experienced relatively greater increases (13% vs. 5% in TRAD and AEL, p < 0.01). The TRAD and AEL groups also increased isometric strength (p < 0.05). A four-week period of augmented eccentric loading increased leg strength in well-trained athletes and track cyclists. The eccentric leg press stimulus was well-tolerated, supporting the inclusion of such training in the preparation programmes of athletes."

However, the insect pest potato leafhopper (PLH) Empoasca fabae (Harris) can cause serious damage and reduce yield of susceptible genotypes. Currently, the willow cultivars in use display varying levels of susceptibility under PLH infestation. However, genes and markers for resistance to PLH are not yet available for marker-assisted selection in breeding. In this study, transcriptome differences between a resistant genotype 94006 (S. purpurea) and a susceptible cultivar ‘Jorr’ (S. viminalis), and their hybrid progeny were determined. Over 600 million RNA-Seq reads were generated and mapped to the Salix purpurea reference transcriptome. Gene expression analyses revealed the unique defense mechanism in resistant genotype 94006 that involves PLH-induced secondary cell wall modification. In the susceptible genotypes, genes involved in programed cell death were highly expressed, explaining the necrosis symptoms after PLH feeding. Overall, the discovery of resistance genes and defense mechanisms provides new resources for shrub willow breeding and research in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3045765020,"Despite the important roles of freshwater gastropods in aquatic ecosystems, the taxonomic status of many taxa is unclear, which is compounded by a lack of information on species population genetic structuring, distribution, and dispersal patterns. The objective of this study was to address the biogeography of the freshwater snail Planorbella trivolvis (Gastropoda: Planorbidae) in the western United States. We amplified two genetic markers (16S, COI) from individuals belonging to western USA populations and downloaded genetic data from GenBank. We utilized minimum spanning networks to assess the genetic patterns and performed Analysis of Molecular Variance and linear regression analyses to determine how geographic distance and watershed identity contributed to the observed genetic structuring. For both markers, we found that the majority of genetic variation was associated within and among populations, rather than among watersheds. Correspondingly, there was no significant effect of geographic distance on genetic distance, suggesting that long-distance dispersal was promoting gene flow between populations. The genetic similarity could reflect avian-mediated dispersal of snails along the Pacific Flyway, a major waterfowl migratory corridor. Further analysis of the population structuring across North America revealed East-West genetic structuring, suggesting that across longitudinal gradients P. trivolvis experiences significant genetic isolation."

Mg oversupply resulted in significantly higher chlorophyll content coupled with lower antioxidant activities and growth, suggesting a direct effect on subtle metabolomes. The relative abundance of bioactive phytochemicals, such as triterpenoids, flavonoids, and cinnamic acids, was lower in the Mg-oversupplied plants than in the control. Correlation analysis between plant phenotypes (plant height, total fresh weight of the shoot, leaf chlorophyll content, and leaf antioxidant content) and the altered metabolomes in P. frutescens leaves suggested an acclimatization mechanism to Mg oversupply. In conclusion, P. frutescens preferentially accumulated compatible solutes, i.e., carbohydrates and amino acids, to cope with higher environmental Mg levels, instead of employing secondary and antioxidative metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3046057626,"Hepatic abundance of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is a critical determinant of circulating plasma LDL cholesterol levels and hence development of coronary artery disease. The sterol-responsive E3 ubiquitin ligase inducible degrader of the LDLR (IDOL) specifically promotes ubiquitination and subsequent lysosomal degradation of the LDLR and thus controls cellular LDL uptake. IDOL contains an extended N-terminal FERM (4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, and moesin) domain, responsible for substrate recognition and plasma membrane association, and a second C-terminal RING domain, responsible for the E3 ligase activity and homodimerization. As IDOL is a putative lipid-lowering drug target, we investigated the molecular details of its substrate recognition. We produced and isolated full-length IDOL protein, which displayed high autoubiquitination activity. However, <i>in vitro</i> ubiquitination of its substrate, the intracellular tail of the LDLR, was low. To investigate the structural basis for this, we determined crystal structures of the extended FERM domain of IDOL and multiple conformations of its F3ab subdomain. These reveal the archetypal F1-F2-F3 trilobed FERM domain structure but show that the F3c subdomain orientation obscures the target-binding site. To substantiate this finding, we analyzed the full-length FERM domain and a series of truncated FERM constructs by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The scattering data support a compact and globular core FERM domain with a more flexible and extended C-terminal region. This flexibility may explain the low activity <i>in vitro</i> and suggests that IDOL may require activation for recognition of the LDLR."

We also do not know whether career patterns of researchers can be considered conventional in terms of steady progress or international mobility, nor do we know if career patterns differ between men and women in research as is commonly assumed. We use sequence analysis to identify career patterns of researchers across positions and institutions, based on full career histories of applicants to the European Research Council frontier research grant schemes. We distinguish five career patterns for early and established men and women researchers. With multinomial logit analyses, we estimate the relative likelihood of researchers with certain characteristics in each pattern. We find grantees among all patterns, and limited evidence of gender differences. Our findings on career patterns in research inform further studies and policy making on career development, research funding, and gender equality."
https://openalex.org/W3045606809,"A huge amount of atomized biological data collected in various databases and the need for a description of their relation by theoretical methods causes the development of data integration methods. The omics data analysis by integration of biological knowledge with mathematical procedures implemented in the OmicsON R library is presented in the paper. OmicsON is a tool for the integration of two sets of data: transcriptomics and metabolomics. In the workflow of the library, the functional grouping and statistical analysis are applied. Subgroups among the transcriptomic and metabolomics sets are created based on the biological knowledge stored in Reactome and String databases. It gives the possibility to analyze such sets of data by multivariate statistical procedures like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) or Partial Least Squares (PLS). The integration of metabolomic and transcriptomic data based on the methodology contained in OmicsON helps to easily obtain information on the connection of data from two different sets. This information can significantly help in assessing the relationship between gene expression and metabolite concentrations, which in turn facilitates the biological interpretation of the analyzed process."
https://openalex.org/W3045640510,"Translation termination in bacteria requires that the stop codon be recognized by release factor RF1 or RF2, leading to hydrolysis of the ester bond between the peptide and tRNA on the ribosome. As a consequence, normal termination cannot proceed if the translated mRNA lacks a stop codon. In Escherichia coli, the ribosome rescue factor ArfA releases the nascent polypeptide from the stalled ribosome with the help of RF2 in a stop codon–independent manner.

Our findings provide a basis for understanding how the ArfA-ribosome complex is specifically recognized by RF2 and how RF2 undergoes a conformational change upon binding to the ArfA-ribosome complex.

In bacteria, the class 1 release factors, RF1 and RF2, recognize the stop codon in the A-site and promote hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA on the ribosome. Whereas UAA codons are recognized by both RF1 and RF2, RF1 is specific for UAG and RF2 for UGA (6Scolnick E. Tompkins R. Caskey T. Nirenberg M. Release factors differing in specificity for terminator codons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61 (4879404): 768-77410.1073/pnas.61.2.768Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Although release factors have slight differences in codon specificity, they share a similar overall structure. Each release factor is composed of four domains, with domains II and IV forming a stable compact structure to which domains I and III are connected. Genetic and biochemical studies revealed that a conserved tripeptide motif in domain II, Pro-Xaa-Thr (PXT) in RF1 or Ser-Pro-Phe (SPF) in RF2, is essential for stop codon recognition (7Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. A tripeptide “anticodon” deciphers stop codons in messenger RNA.Nature. 2000; 403 (10688208): 680-68410.1038/35001115Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both release factors have a universally conserved Gly-Gly-Gln (GGQ) tripeptide motif in domain III that interacts with the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome to promote peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis (8Rawat U.B.

The termination process requires coordination between stop codon recognition on the 30S subunit and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis on the 50S subunit. Accurate recognition of the stop codon is important for the cell because premature termination on sense codons may lead to accumulation of truncated proteins. During translation elongation, high-fidelity tRNA discrimination is achieved by two consecutive selection steps, initial selection and proofreading. Whereas the former step occurs without energy consumption, the latter step includes GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu to prevent incorporation of an incorrect amino acid into the nascent polypeptide (11Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Fidelity of aminoacyl-tRNA selection on the ribosome: kinetic and structural mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70 (11395413): 415-43510.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.415Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recognition of the stop codon by RF1 or RF2 is achieved by a one-step process without energy consumption (12Freistroffer D.V. Kwiatkowski M. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. The accuracy of codon recognition by polypeptide release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97 (10681447): 2046-205110.1073/pnas.030541097Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). RF3, the only GTPase in the termination process, induces rotation of the small subunit to facilitate dissociation of class 1 RF from the ribosome after hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA but is not involved in stop codon recognition (13Freistroffer D.V.

According to the “tripeptide anticodon” model, the conserved tripeptide, PXT in RF1 or SPF in RF2, determines stop codon specificity.

When the ribosome is trapped by truncated mRNA lacking a stop codon, the ribosome stalls at the 3′ end of mRNA, as neither RF1 nor RF2 functions. In bacteria, tmRNA/SmpB relieves the stalled ribosome and adds a degradation tag to the nascent polypeptide through a process called trans-translation (22Himeno H. Nameki N. Kurita D. Muto A. Abo T. Ribosome rescue systems in bacteria.Biochimie. 2015; 114 (25446863): 102-11210.1016/j.biochi.2014.11.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In trans-translation, tmRNA receives the nascent polypeptide from peptidyl-tRNA and provides an internal stop codon to terminate the protein synthesis. Trans-translation is a sophisticated system combining ribosome rescue system with nascent polypeptide quality control mechanism. Although tmRNA is universally conserved in bacteria, it is dispensable for the viability of some species, including Escherichia coli, suggesting the presence of other ribosome rescue systems (23Giudice E. Gillet R. The task force that rescues stalled ribosomes in bacteria.Trends Biochem.

Recently, it was reported that alternative ribosome rescue factors, ArfA and ArfB (YaeJ), are involved in peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis of stalled ribosomes (24Chadani Y. Ono K. Ozawa S. Takahashi Y.

Unlike ArfB, ArfA itself cannot promote peptide release due to the absence of the catalytic GGQ motif, and instead it requires RF2, but not RF1, for ribosome rescue (27Chadani Y. Ito K. Kutsukake K. Abo T. ArfA recruits release factor 2 to rescue stalled ribosomes by peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis in Escherichia coli.Mol.

In our previous work, we found that ArfA binds to the 70S ribosome but not to RF2 and that RF2 binds to the ArfA-70S ribosome complex, indicating that ArfA binds to the 70S ribosome prior to RF2 binding rather than in complex with each other (29Kurita D. Chadani Y. Muto A. Abo T. Himeno H.

Recent cryo-EM structures revealed that the N-terminal region of ArfA is sandwiched between the decoding center of the 30S subunit and the switch loop of RF2, whereas its C-terminal region extends toward the mRNA entry channel on the small subunit (30James N.R.

However, it remains unclear how RF2 but not RF1 recognizes the ArfA-ribosome complex in the absence of a stop codon in the A-site. In this study, we identified the residues in RF2 required for ribosome binding and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis (PTH) activity. Our results suggest that RF2 recognizes the ArfA-ribosome complex through hydrophobic interactions and β-sheet formation between RF2 and ArfA and undergoes productive conformational change to allow hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site. Although RF1 and RF2 share 36% amino acid sequence identity in E. coli (Fig. 1A) and similar function in translation termination, only RF2 plays a distinct role in the ArfA-mediated ribosome rescue system. To elucidate the specificity determinant of RF2, we designed several kinds of swapping mutants and tested their PTH activities in vitro. Given that the binding site of RF2 on the ribosome is in close proximity to that of ArfA, we focused on the residues at the interface between RF2 and ArfA. Recent cryo-EM structures of ArfA-RF2–stalled ribosome (nonstop complex) have revealed that ArfA forms the interface with the switch loop (residues 319–321, E. coli RF2 numbering) and β5-strand (residues 213–224) of RF2 via hydrophobic interactions (31Ma C. Kurita D. Li N. Chen Y. Himeno H. Gao N. Mechanistic insights into the alternative translation termination by ArfA and RF2.Nature. 2017; 541 (27906160): 550-55310.1038/nature20822Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A structural comparison of RF2 between the nonstop complex and canonical termination complex showed the different conformation of switch loop (Fig. 1B) (35Svidritskiy E. Demo G. Loveland A.B. Xu C. Korostelev A.A. Extensive ribosome and RF2 rearrangements during translation termination.Elife. 2019; 8 (31513010): e4685010.7554/eLife.46850Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In canonical termination, the switch loop extends to the decoding center, allowing the interaction of RF2 (Trp-319) with 16S rRNA (A1492). In contrast, in the nonstop complex, the switch loop interacts with ArfA rather than 16S rRNA due to occupation of the decoding center by ArfA. Trp-319 in the switch loop of RF2 forms a hydrophobic pocket with Phe-217 of β5 and the central portion of ArfA (Fig. 1, C and D). Introduction of mutations in the hydrophobic residues of RF2 or ArfA decreases PTH activity in vitro (31Ma C. Kurita D. Li N. Chen Y. Himeno H. Gao N. Mechanistic insights into the alternative translation termination by ArfA and RF2.Nature. 2017; 541 (27906160): 550-55310.1038/nature20822Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that RF2 preference in ArfA-mediated ribosome rescue is derived from these hydrophobic interactions between RF2 and ArfA. To verify this hypothesis, we designed swapping mutants and assessed their in vitro PTH activities as we have reported previously (29Kurita D. Chadani Y. Muto A. Abo T. Himeno H. ArfA recognizes the lack of mRNA in the mRNA channel after RF2 binding for ribosome rescue.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25355516): 13339-1335210.1093/nar/gku1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Ma C. Kurita D. Li N. Chen Y. Himeno H. Gao N.

Stalled ribosomes programmed with an mRNA encompassing the Shine–Dalgarno sequence to the P-site AUG codon and N-formyl-[3H]Met-tRNA in the P-site were prepared, and they were reacted with the ArfA and RF mutants. Using this system, we confirmed that RF2 WT has ArfA-dependent PTH activity, whereas RF1 does not (Fig. 2A). Then we swapped the residues of the switch loop and/or β5 of RF1 for the corresponding residues in RF2. We found that all three variants—“RF1 switch loop” in which the switch loop of RF1 was replaced by the corresponding residues of RF2, “RF1 A200F” in which Ala-200 in β5 of RF1 was replaced by the corresponding residue Phe-217 in RF2, and “RF1 switch loop/A200F”—failed to promote ArfA-dependent PTH activity (Fig. 2A), whereas they had stop codon-dependent PTH activity comparable with WT RF1 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, introduction of the switch loop and/or β5 of RF1 into RF2 (RF2 switch loop, RF2 F217A, and RF2 switch loop/F217A) had effects on neither ArfA– nor stop codon–dependent PTH activity (Fig. 2, A and B). To test the effects of these mutations on ribosome binding, we performed filter-binding assay. As reported previously, the ribosome-bound RF was analyzed by centrifugal ultrafiltration followed by SDS-PAGE (29Kurita D. Chadani Y. Muto A. Abo T. Himeno H. ArfA recognizes the lack of mRNA in the mRNA channel after RF2 binding for ribosome rescue.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25355516): 13339-1335210.1093/nar/gku1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RF1 switch loop, RF1 A200F, and RF1 switch loop/A200F bound to the ArfA-ribosome complex to a certain extent, whereas WT RF1 did not (Fig. 2C). To compare the affinities of RF mutants, ArfA-ribosome complex was incubated with various concentrations of RF (Fig. 2D). The Kd value of RF2 WT was found to be 105 nm. This is in line with the cellular concentration of RF2 (>1 μm) (36Adamski F.M. McCaughan K.K. Jørgensen F. Kurland C.G. Tate W.P. The concentration of polypeptide chain release factors 1 and 2 at different growth rates of Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238 (8176726): 302-30810.1006/jmbi.1994.1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We observed the difference in ribosome binding between WT RF1 and RF1 switch loop/A200F, although we could not determine accurate Kd values due to its low affinity. Given that RF1 switch loop/A200F required a >10-fold higher concentration of RF for complex formation than RF2 WT, the Kd value of RF1 switch loop/A200F should be higher than 1 μm (Fig. 2E). On the other hand, RF1 switch loop/A200F exhibited stop codon–dependent PTH activity and ribosome binding comparable with WT RF1 and RF2 (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that the switch loop and β5 have little effect on canonical termination. Taken together, these residues of RF2 contribute to ribosome binding to a certain extent, but they are not sufficient for PTH activity in ArfA-mediated rescue. To explore the regions of RF2 required for ribosome rescue, we performed domain-swapping experiments. As RF1 consists of four domains, 1–106 (domain I), 107–208 (domain II), 209–300 (domain III), and 301–360 (domain IV) (37Shin D.H. Brandsen J. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim R. Kim S.H. Structural analyses of peptide release factor 1 from Thermotoga maritima reveal domain flexibility required for its interaction with the ribosome.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341 (15312775): 227-23910.1016/j.jmb.2004.05.055Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we designed all possible combinations of domain-swapping RF1 (Fig. 3A). Note that all mutants have switch loop and A200F mutations that are derived from the RF2 sequence. Mutants with combinations of “domain I of RF1” and “domain II of RF2” were not available due to lack of expression of proteins, in agreement with a previous study (28Shimizu Y. ArfA recruits RF2 into stalled ribosomes.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 423 (22922063): 624-63110.1016/j.jmb.2012.08.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mutant with replacement of residues 1–106 (domain I) of RF1 with the corresponding residues of RF2 is called “RF1 1–106”. Interestingly, RF1 1–300 (domain I/II/III) and RF1 1–208, 301–360 (domain I/II/IV) exhibited ArfA-dependent PTH activities (Fig. 3B) as well as stop codon–dependent PTH activities (Fig. 3C) comparable with RF2 WT. We found that RF1 1–208 (domain I/II) had a moderate ArfA-dependent PTH activity, whereas its stop codon-dependent activity was comparable with WT RF1. Conversely, all mutants with RF1 sequences of either domain I or II exhibited defects in ArfA-dependent PTH activity. Taken together, these results indicated that both residues 1–106 (domain I) and 107–208 (domain II) of RF2 are essential for ArfA-dependent PTH activity and that 209–300 (domain III) or 301–360 (domain IV) is supplemental. To specify the regions in domains I and II of RF2 required for ribosome rescue, we swapped a segment(s), which is a smaller structural unit than the domain, using RF1 1–208, 301–360 variant (domain I/II/IV). As domain I of RF1 is composed of three α-helices, we divided domain I into three segments, 1–32, 33–72, and 73–106, and designed hybrid RF containing all six possible combination sets of segments (Fig. 4A). We found that all mutants possessing segment 73–106 derived from RF2 exhibited both ArfA-dependent (Fig. 4B) and stop codon–dependent PTH activity (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, mutants with 73–106 derived from RF1 were not available due to low protein expression level. These results raise the possibility that domain II may require the α-helix (α3) of domain I for stability of RF2. Unlike domain I, domain II is more complex, as it contains many inter- and intradomain interactions. Domains II and IV form a compact structure with four α-helices and an eight-stranded β-sheet. These interactions make it difficult to replace domain II of RF1 with that of RF2. Therefore, we examined which region of domain II in RF2 is dispensable for PTH activity. Domain II in RF2 can be divided into six segments (125–139, 140–160, 161–178, 179–196, 197–213, and 214–225, RF2 numbering), and these segments were replaced by the corresponding residues in RF1. When residues 140–160 of RF2 were replaced by the corresponding residues of RF1, we could not obtain soluble protein. We found that swapping 179–196 or 197–213 reduced ArfA-mediated PTH activities as well as stop codon–dependent PTH activities (Fig. 5, A and B). Given that residues 140–160 forming a long α-helix (α5) are surrounded by an eight-stranded β-sheet including residues 179–196 and 197–213, the helix may be stabilized by intradomain interactions. We observed no defects in PTH activity of RF2 214–225, although residues 214–225 (β5) form an antiparallel β-sheet with β4 of RF2 and β1 of ArfA. To identify the residues in these three segments (140–160, 179–196, and 197–213) required for PTH activity that are not conserved between RF1 and RF2, we introduced mutations and measured the initial velocity of PTH activity. We found that RF2 142–147 (α5), 179–181 (β3), V198G (β4), and R213I (β5) mutations affected both ArfA-dependent (Fig. 6A) and stop codon–dependent PTH activities (Fig. 6B). The reduced PTH activity of RF2 V198G is consistent with cryo-EM structures showing that the side chain of Val-198 forms hydrophobic interactions with those of Phe-217 (β5) and Trp-319 (switch loop) of RF2 and those of Ile-16, Leu-20, and Phe-25 of ArfA. When we introduced valine into the corresponding residue (Gly-181) in RF1 to obtain RF1 G181V/A200F/switch loop mutants, soluble protein was not available. We found that R213I affected PTH activity, in agreement with a previous biochemical study (38Korkmaz G. Sanyal S. R213I mutation in release factor 2 (RF2) is one step forward for engineering an omnipotent release factor in bacteria Escherichia coli.J. Biol.

The initial velocity of ArfA-dependent PTH activity plotted against RF2 concentrations generated hyperbolic curves that fit the Michaelis–Menten equation (Fig. 6C). The Km values of RF2 142–147 and RF2 179–181 were 6.1 ± 0.9 × 10−6 and 9.8 ± 3 × 10−6m, respectively, whereas that of RF2 WT was 0.49 ± 0.07 × 10−6m (Table 1). The kcat values of these mutants were 0.056 ± 0.003 and 0.050 ± 0.01 s−1, respectively, comparable with that of RF2 WT (0.037 ± 0.005 s−1). According to the cryo-EM structures, the α5 helix, including residues 142–147, is surrounded by the β-sheet. The β3-strand (including residues 179–181) is sandwiched between β1 and β2. Notably, the side chain of Trp-144 can form hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom in His-199 (β4). Therefore, partial replacement of residues 142–147 or 179–181 may affect the β-sheet or surrounding structure, resulting in reduction of ribosome binding activity. On the other hand, RF2 V198G and R213I showed 7- and 3-fold higher Km (3.4 ± 1 × 10−6 and 1.5 ± 0.5 × 10−6m, respectively) than RF2 WT.Table 1Km and kcat values of RF2 mutantsKmkcat10−6 ms−1RF2 WT0.49 ± 0.070.037 ± 0.005RF2 142–1476.1 ± 0.90.056 ± 0.003RF2 179–1819.8 ± 30.050 ± 0.01RF2 V198G3.4 ± 10.030 ± 0.004RF2 R213I1.5 ± 0.50.024 ± 0.004RF2 H199A5.4 ± 0.80.012 ± 0.0001RF2 H214A0.79 ± 0.20.032 ± 0.003RF2 H253A0.36 ± 0.070.0031 ± 0.00007RF2 H265A2.8 ± 0.40.019 ± 0.005RF2 H281A0.32 ± 0.020.0078 ± 0.0008 Open table in a new tab According to molecular dynamics simulation, the distance between SPF and GGQ motif is affected by the charge state of conserved histidine residues (39Ma B. Nussinov R. Release factors eRF1 and RF2: a universal mechanism controls the large conformational changes.J. Biol.

There are five conserved histidine residues in RF2, two in domain II and three in domain III, and we tested the roles of these histidine residues by replacing each with alanine. We found that H199A, H253A, H265A, and H281A exhibited significant reductions in PTH activity (Fig. 6, A and B). We also determined the Michaelis–Menten parameters for RF variants (Fig. 6C). The Km values of H199A and H265A were 5.4 ± 0.8 × 10−6 and 2.8 ± 0.4 × 10−6m, respectively. The kcat values of these mutants were comparable with WT. The higher Km and similar kcat values of H199A and H265A indicate significant defects in ribosome binding (Table 1). On the other hand, H253A and H281A showed lower kcat values (0.0031 ± 0.00007 and 0.0078 ± 0.008 s−1, respectively) than RF2 WT (0.037 ± 0.005 s−1), although the Km values of these mutants were comparable with RF2 WT. The fact that H253A and H281A affect PTH activity but not ribosome binding suggests that these histidine residues play a role in the step after ribosome binding. To elucidate the specificity determinant of RF2 in ArfA-mediated ribosome rescue, we designed RF1 variants in which residues were swapped with those of RF2 and tested their peptide release and ribosome binding activities in vitro. Our previous cryo-EM analysis showed that RF2 establishes a large interaction interface with the N-terminal region of ArfA mainly via hydrophobic interactions (31Ma C. Kurita D. Li N. Chen Y. Himeno H. Gao N. Mechanistic insights into the alternative translation termination by ArfA and RF2.Nature. 2017; 541 (27906160): 550-55310.1038/nature20822Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Unlike RF2, RF1 seems to be incapable of such hydrophobic interactions with ArfA. Biochemical studies showed that mutations in ArfA or RF2 at the interface decreased in vitro peptide release activity (31Ma C. Kurita D. Li N. Chen Y. Himeno H. Gao N.

https://openalex.org/W3045729513,"The neural mechanisms underlying forward suppression in the auditory cortex remain a puzzle. Little attention is paid to thalamic contribution despite the important fact that the thalamus gates upstreaming information to the auditory cortex. This study compared the time courses of forward suppression in the auditory thalamus, thalamocortical inputs and cortex using the two-tone stimulus paradigm. The preceding and succeeding tones were 20-ms long. Their frequency and amplitude were set at the characteristic frequency and 20 dB above the minimum threshold of given neurons, respectively. In the ventral division of the medial geniculate body of the thalamus, we found that the duration of complete forward suppression was about 75 ms and the duration of partial suppression was from 75 ms to about 300 ms after the onset of the preceding tone. We also found that during the partial suppression period, the responses to the succeeding tone were further suppressed in the primary auditory cortex. The forward suppression of thalamocortical field excitatory postsynaptic potentials was between those of thalamic and cortical neurons but much closer to that of thalamic ones. Our results indicate that early suppression in the cortex could result from complete suppression in the thalamus whereas later suppression may involve thalamocortical and intracortical circuitry. This suggests that the complete suppression that occurs in the thalamus provides the cortex with a ""silence"" window that could potentially benefit cortical processing and/or perception of the information carried by the preceding sound."
https://openalex.org/W3046120839,"Seasonal heat storage is considered as one of the key elements on the path to a low-emission economy. Embedded in local district heating networks, they raise the share of renewable energies and balance out highly fluctuating supplies of e.g. solar systems or windmills. The technology of seasonal heat storage can be described as almost technically mature, with well-established concepts and some systems being in operation for a considerable time. Nevertheless, the operating experience gained to date also revealed two critical problems. On the one hand, even smallest leakages in sealing foils led to irreparable breakdowns. On the other hand, heat loss in the marginal areas was revealed as a key deficiency, preventing the technology from advancing towards global marketability. This study presents an experimental approach to address these two key issues in the field of seasonal energy storage. Two small-scale laboratory tests were carried out to test paraffin wax as a completely novel component in the marginal area of seasonal storages. This is based on two material properties: As hydrophobic and mobile medium, the warmed and molten paraffin should actively seal the fissures and holes in the event of leakage. Additionally, the latent heat storage properties of the paraffin wax should increase the systems’ total storage capacity and reduce lateral heat losses via its low thermal conductivity. With retardation periods from 2.5 to 4 hours, the results show an effective phase change effect of the paraffin wax, which reduces energy losses and allows to buffer short-term, intensive loading and unloading processes. By storing up to 138 kJ/kg energy in the paraffin wax, increased capacities of application-scale pit storages by up to 40.70 MWh are to be expected. Additionally, the self-healing features could be successfully demonstrated: With only small losses of between 1.5 and 17%, the paraffin wax effectively sealed artificially incised leaks. Thereby, the mechanism was most effective for local defects. Following these positive demonstrations of feasibility, technical design questions still remain, which concern prevention of deformation of the paraffin wax. Once solved, this new component can then provide a path for further optimization of seasonal heat storage technologies."
https://openalex.org/W3000120811,"PhoH2 proteins are highly conserved across bacteria and archaea yet their biological function is poorly characterised. We examined the growth profiles of Mycobacterium smegmatis strains mc2155 and mc2155 ΔphoH2 and observed the same growth profile and growth rate in a variety of conditions. In light of the comparable growth, we used RNAseq to provide a snapshot of the differences between the transcriptomes of M. smegmatis mc2155 and M. smegmatis mc2155 ΔphoH2 during normal growth. At 48 hours, elevated expression of the sigF regulon was observed in ΔphoH2 relative to wild type. In biochemical assays, PhoH2 showed activity toward sigF mRNA insinuating a role of PhoH2 in modulating the pool of sigF mRNA in the cell during normal growth, adding further complexity to the repertoire of reported mechanisms of post-translational regulation. Multiple copies of the preferred target site of PhoH2 were identified in loops of the sigF mRNA structure, leading us to propose a mechanism for the activity of PhoH2 that is initiated after assembly on specific single-stranded loops of RNA. We hypothesise that PhoH2 is a toxin-antitoxin that contributes to the regulation of SigF at a post-transcriptional level through targeted activity on sigF mRNA. This work presents the first evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of SigF along with the biological function of PhoH2 from M. smegmatis. This has implications for the highly conserved PhoH2 toxin-antitoxin module across the mycobacteria including the important human pathogen M. tuberculosis."

Methods A qualitative study design was used by conducting In-depth interviews with 24 women from Turkish and Moroccan descent who gave birth during the past three years in maternity wards in Flanders, Belgium. The interviews were analysed using a Grounded Theory Approach. Results This study shows that the women’s care experiences were shaped by the care interactions with their caregivers, more specifically on the attention that was given by the caregivers towards two essential dimensions of the care relationship, viz. Ereignis (attention to what happens) and Erlebnis (attention to how it happens). These two dimensions were interrelated in four different ways, which defined the women’s care experiences as being either ‘uncaring’, ‘protocolized’, ‘embraced’ or ‘ambiguous’. Moreover, these experiences were fundamentally embedded within the women’s cultural context, which has to be understood as a relational process in which an emotional and moral meaning was given to the women’s care expectations, interactions and interpretations of care. Conclusions The findings reveal that the quality of intercultural care depends on the nature and quality of care interactions between ethnic minority patients and caregivers much more than on the way in which cultural questions and tensions are being handled or dealt with in a practical way. As such, the importance of establishing a meaningful care relationship should be the priority when providing intercultural care. In this, a shift in perspective on ‘culture’ from being an ‘individual culture-in-isolation’ towards an understanding of culture as being inter-relational and emerging from within these care relationships is necessary."

Despite the mounting evidence of the effects of fuels use on health, few studies focus on the effect of cooking fuels have on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a surrogate atherosclerosis biomarker in the early stages of pregnancy. This study aimed to examine the association between the use of cooking fuels and CIMT during early trimester of pregnancy among cooking women in Myanmar.In this cross-sectional study, a part of an ongoing birth cohort analysis, a total of 192 cooking pregnant women over 18 years with gestational weeks less than 18 were recruited from 15 rural health centers in Nay Pyi Taw from September to November 2019. Sociodemographic data, residential data, and fuels use data were collected with semi-structured questionnaires in face-to-face interviews. Anthropometric, hemodynamic, blood lipids, and ultrasound CIMT measurements were performed under standard protocols. Multiple linear regression was modeled to explore associations.The study included 70 firewood fuel users, 26 charcoal fuel users, and 96 electricity fuel users. Following adjustments for potential confounding factors, firewood use was significantly associated with the increase of all CIMT analyzed. Importantly, a greater increase of mean CIMT of the right common carotid artery (RCCA; β = 0.033 mm; 95%CI: 0.006, 0.058; P<0.05) had significant association with charcoal use compared to firewood use (β = 0.029 mm; 95%CI: 0.010, 0.049; P<0.05).Our findings demonstrate that the indoor use of cooking fuels that cause indoor air pollution, such as firewood and charcoal, is a considerable risk factor for human health and is associated with increased CIMT, wherein charcoal use contributes to more increase of mean CIMT of the RCCA. Measures to prevent health risks related to the use of such fuels should be instituted early on during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3045644846,"Individual differences in dispositional coping might influence how ambiguous situations involving interactions of men and women are interpreted and remembered. Specifically, we hypothesized that women with a sensitive coping style actively maintain ambiguously threatening stimuli in their memory, showing so-called sensitive maintenance. As a prerequisite to investigate this hypothesis, two surveys (Studies 1 and 2; N = 151 and N = 252) were conducted to answer the questions whether fear of sexual assault is of relevance for young women in Germany and whether ambiguous (rather than only unambiguously threatening) situations are experienced to a significant extent. After confirming this for our target population, our main hypothesis was tested in Study 3 (N = 192) by combining tasks assessing the appraisal and the forgetting of nonthreatening, threatening, and ambiguous pictures showing interactions of men and women, and by varying the cognitive load during the retention interval. Whereas fear of rape predicted the appraisal of pictures, coping dispositions predicted forgetting of ambiguously and unambiguously threatening pictures in the hypothesized way. Results are discussed from the perspective of adaptivity and functionality of memory."
