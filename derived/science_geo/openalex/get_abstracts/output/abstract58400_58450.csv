https://openalex.org/W2082589966,"The 3-angstrom electron density map of crystalline yeast phenylalanine transfer RNA has provided us with a complete three-dimensional model which defines the positions of all of the nucleotide residues in the molecule. The overall features of the molecule are virtually the same as those seen at a resolution of 4 angstroms except that many additional details of tertiary structure are now visualized. Ten types of hydrogen bonding are identified which define the specificity of tertiary interactions. The molecule is also stabilized by considerable stacking of the planar purines and pyrimidines. This tertiary structure explains, in a simple and direct fashion, chemical modification studies of transfer RNA. Since most of the tertiary interactions involve nucleotides which are common to all transfer RNA's, it is likely that this three-dimensional structure provides a basic pattern of folding which may help to clarify the three-dimensional structure of all transfer RNA's."

https://openalex.org/W2055608327,"Paradoxical, concurrent hyper-and hyporeactivity of a profound nature to specific stimuli occurred when 10 micrograms of morphine was microinjected bilaterally into the periaqueductal gray matter of the rat brain. Both effects at this site were dose-dependent. The hyperreactivity (to previously neutral auditory and visual stimuli) was obtained only with intracerebrally injected morphine and never with intraperitoneally injected morphine or with other opiates administered either way. Rapid tolerance to toxic doses of morphine developed at this site, as well as cross tolerance of the hyporeactivity to painful stimuli between routes (intracerebral to intraperitoneal) of morphine administration. Both the hyper- and hyporeactivity were fully reversible by intracerebral injection of naloxone in the periaqueductal gray. Thus, the periaqueductal gray appears to be a major pathway for morphine action."

https://openalex.org/W1489835182,"Abstract Earlier studies showed that the M13 single-stranded circle is converted to duplex replicative forms (RF) in vivo and in vitro by a rifampicin-sensitive system that fails to act on φX174 DNA. In the absence of DNA polymerase I, the synthetic complementary strand produced by a crude cell extract contained a small gap at a unique position relative to the viral template strand. In these studies we show that the conversion of viral M13 DNA to the covalently closed duplex form requires the action of six purified proteins: RNA polymerase, DNA unwinding protein of Escherichia coli, DNA polymerase III*, copolymerase III*, DNA polymerase I, and DNA ligase. In the absence of polymerase I, the location of the gap in the RF produced by the reconstituted protein system is the same as that produced by the crude cell extract. The functions of the several proteins, either demonstrated or inferred, are as follows: RNA polymerase to form a priming fragment, DNA unwinding protein to mask the single-stranded DNA in all but the promoter region for RNA polymerase and to support polymerase III*-copolymerase III* in carrying out most of the DNA chain growth, polymerase I to fill the small remaining gap, including that created by its 5'→3' exonucleolytic excision of the remaining RNA fragment, and ligase to join the polynucleotide ends to complete the synthetic complementary circle. Essential functions of RNA polymerase, polymerase III*, and polymerase I in the crude system have been verified by studies of extracts of strains deficient in these proteins. The DNA unwinding protein coded by gene 5 of M13 and essential for synthesis of the viral strands later in infection, fails to replace the E. coli unwinding protein, but instead inhibits conversion of the single strand to RF."
https://openalex.org/W1619666977,"Exonuclease VII from Escherichia coli is specific for single-stranded DNA, degrading denatured DNA, single-stranded regions extending from the ends of duplex DNA, or displaced single-stranded regions. Hydrolysis is initiated at both 3′ and 5′ termini. Exonuclease VII can also excise thymine dimers from duplex DNA following treatment of the DNA with the Micrococcus luteus endonuclease specific for thymine dimers. The enzyme has no detectable activity on RNA or DNA-RNA hybrid molecules. The limit products of exonuclease VII action are oligonucleotides bearing 5′-phosphoryl and 3′-hydroxyl termini predominantly in the range of tetramers to dodecamers; no mononucleotide products have been observed. The enzyme acts in a processive fashion, initially releasing large, acid-insoluble oligonucleotides which can be degraded further to produce a limit product of acid-soluble oligonucleotides. The possible role of exonuclease VII in recombination and in the repair of ultra-violet damage to DNA is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1562167636,"Abstract A new deoxyribonuclease, exonuclease VII, has been identified and purified 1,700-fold from Escherichia coli K12. The enzyme is an exonuclease specific for single-stranded DNA or duplex DNA containing single-stranded termini. The purified enzyme is active in the presence of EDTA, but is stimulated 25% by MgCl2. Optimal activity occurs at pH 7.9 in potassium phosphate buffer. The molecular weight, as determined by gel filtration and sedimentation analysis, is 88,000; the Stokes radius is 89 A. The friction coefficient of the enzyme is 3.07, suggesting an asymmetric structure. In the accompanying paper (Chase, J. W., and Richardson, C. C. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4553–4561) we show that the enzyme is an exonuclease which can initiate hydrolysis at both 3' and 5' termini to yield products which are exclusively oligonucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1935143592,"Abstract An enzymic mechanism different from those described earlier is demonstrated for the insensitivity to antibiotics carried by R factors. An R plasmid carrying resistance to high levels of the folic acid analog, trimethoprim, was shown to induce highly increased levels of dihydrofolate reductase activity in sensitive cells of Escherichia coli. The new enzyme differed from the normal cellular enzyme by being more heat-sensitive and more resistant to trimethoprim inhibition. This substrate analog inhibited the R factor-induced enzyme with a Ki value 6000 to 7000 times larger than that of the enzyme purified from drug-sensitive cells."
https://openalex.org/W1494560345,"Abstract A new procedure for the isolation of physically and enzymatically homogeneous Elongation Factor G based on the isolation of an Elongation Factor G · ribosome · GDP · fusidic acid complex is described. The yield from this procedure is 23 to 36% of the theoretical and results in an enzyme of specific activity 6200 to 6700 units per A280. The enzyme was shown to be physically homogeneous by disc gel electrophoresis under both native and denatured conditions. The enzymatic purity of the preparation with respect to enzymes utilizing guanine nucleotides was examined by quantitation of contaminating nonribosomal dependent GTPase, GDPase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, and polynucleotide phosphorylase activities. The highest contaminating activity was found to be 0.002% of the activity of Elongation Factor G. Utilizing this homogeneous Elongation Factor G, the reaction involving the hydrolytic cleavage of GTP catalyzed by the ribosome and Elongation Factor G was examined. The position of GTP cleavage was elucidated by the technique of 18O incorporation from water. It was demonstrated that solvent oxygen is incorporated only into the inorganic phosphate derived from the γ-phosphate of GTP. The number of solvent oxygen atoms incorporated per phosphate was 0.81 ± 0.19. Neither the α- nor β-phosphates of GDP, the other product of hydrolysis, incorporated solvent oxygen. From these observations the position of GTP cleavage was identified as occurring between the γ phosphorus atom and the oxygen bridging the β and γ phosphorus atoms. Using 32Pi and [α-32P]GDP, it was determined that neither the exchange of Pi into GTP nor the exchange of GDP into GTP are catalyzed by Elongation Factor G and the ribosome."

https://openalex.org/W1564922487,"Abstract CDP-diglyceride: l-serine phosphatidyltransferase (phosphatidylserine synthetase) of Escherichia coli is tightly associated with ribosomes in crude cell-free extracts. The synthetase has now been separated from ribosomes by extraction with solutions containing 5 m NaCl and has been purified 100-fold. The partially purified enzyme is devoid of contaminating hydrolytic activities and nearly free of RNA. The enzyme catalyzes exchange reactions of CMP with CDP-diglyceride, and of serine with phosphatidylserine. Furthermore, the enzyme catalyzes the formation of CDP-diglyceride from phosphatidylserine and CMP, although the equilibrium strongly favors synthesis of phosphatidylserine. A phosphatidyl-enzyme intermediate may thus be involved in the action of this enzyme. Under the conditions employed in the assay system, however, this intermediate seems to be unstable, since the synthetase also hydrolyzes phosphatidylserine and CDP-diglyceride at a slow rate."
https://openalex.org/W1541276920,"Abstract A protein which binds strongly and preferentially to single-stranded DNA has been purified by DNA-cellulose chromatography from Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T7. The protein, synthesized between 5 and 18 min following infection, comprises more than 0.1% of soluble protein in T7-infected cells. In vitro studies show that this protein can specifically stimulate the rate of polymerization catalyzed by the T7-induced DNA polymerase. At low temperatures, where the T7-induced DNA polymerase utilizes single-stranded DNA poorly as template primer, the binding protein stimulates the rate of synthesis 10- to 15-fold. The stimulatory effect is also observed employing single-stranded DNA at 37°; however, the stimulation is not as great (2- to 3-fold) at the higher temperature. Similarly, when a double-stranded DNA containing internal single-stranded regions is used as template, stimulation is observed, but is not as pronounced (approximately 5-fold). T7 DNA polymerase activity can be stimulated 20- to 50-fold by salt when a gapped DNA is used as template but only 1.5-fold when a single-stranded DNA is used as template. On the latter template, stimulation by binding protein is relatively constant over a range of salt concentrations, whereas on the former template, stimulation occurs only at salt concentrations less than optimal for polymerase activity. The stimulatory reaction is relatively insensitive to pH. The protein has a molecular weight of 31,000 and forms aggregates at high protein concentrations in the presence of magnesium ions. It is capable of binding to single-stranded DNA in quantities which exceed the weight of the DNA by a factor of 20. The protein does not bind to native DNA. The T7 DNA-binding protein dissociates from single-stranded T7 DNA with a rate constant of about 1 x 10-4 s-1 and a half-life of dissociation between 97 and 120 min under the conditions studied."

https://openalex.org/W1563355822,"Abstract Spectral and chromatographic data as well as methods for synthesis of 14C-labeled ketopantoic acid, ketopantoyl lactone, pantoic acid, and pantoyl lactone are presented. The products of ketopantoic acid and ketopantoyl lactone reductases were characterized as pantoic acid and pantoyl lactone, respectively. Unlike pantoyl lactone, ketopantoyl lactone spontaneously hydrolyzes and has a half-life of 2.2 min at pH 7. Purification of ketopantoyl lactone reductase resulted in the separation of two nearly homogeneous forms of the enzyme. Both forms have nearly the same molecular weight (27,000) and exhibit similar kinetic properties. The Michaelis constants of ketopantoyl lactone and NADPH, respectively, are 14 and 62 µm with Form A of the enzyme and 31 and 39 µm with Form B of the enzyme. Each has a molecular activity of about 2,700. A potential function of the enzyme for cell division is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1481349627,"Abstract The requirement for chain initiation factor 3 in the translation of synthetic polynucleotides lacking an ApUpG codon was examined. Highly purified IF-3 stimulates amino acid incorporation 6- to 10-fold in the presence of 4 µg of poly(U). Based on this observation, a simple and specific assay was developed for the purification of IF-3 from the 1.0 m NH4Cl wash of Escherichia coli MRE 600 ribosomes. At all steps of purification, IF-3 activity detected by the poly(U) assay coincided with that determined by R17 RNA-dependent lysine incorporation. The purified factor was required for maximal rates of amino acid incorporation with poly(U), poly(A), and other synthetic polynucleotides. Samples of purified IF-3 isolated from uninfected and T4-infected E. coli MRE 600 migrated as one major band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with a molecular weight of 22,600. Both standard IF-3 and T4-IF-3 were found to promote the translation of R17 RNA and late T4 RNA with equal efficiency."

https://openalex.org/W1490419317,"Abstract An acidic protein isolated from the 1.0 m NH4Cl wash of Escherichia coli MRE 600 ribosomes was found to inhibit translation of R17 RNA or poly(U) and initiation complex formation with R17 RNA. The effect of this protein on poly(U) translation was used as the basis of a simple and specific assay for its purification. The factor was purified to homogeneity by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite, and Sephadex G-150, and its molecular weight was determined to be 69,000. Factor activity was rapidly lost above 50°, and was not inactivated by treatment with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. An affinity of the purified protein for RNA was shown by the formation of an RNA-protein complex which could be retained on Millipore filters. On the basis of molecular weight, mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and inhibitory activity in R17 RNA and poly(U) translation, the factor was identified as subunit I of Qβ replicase."

https://openalex.org/W1622536752,"Abstract The effect of subunit I, an acidic protein isolated from the 1.0 m NH4Cl wash of Escherichia coli MRE 600, on the translation of synthetic and natural mRNA was investigated. In addition to R17 RNA and poly(U) translation, subunit I strongly inhibited amino acid incorporation directed by synthetic polynucleotides containing a high proportion of pyrimidines. Inhibition of translation was independent of the time of addition of this factor to the reaction. The amount of inhibition by subunit I of either poly(U) or R17 RNA translation was a sensitive function of the messenger concentration in the assay. A stable complex of subunit I and ribosomes was isolated and was found to have reduced activity in messenger translation. No interaction of subunit I with IF-3 could be demonstrated either in messenger translation or in dissociation of single ribosomes. Endogenous E. coli mRNA translation and ApUpG-dependent binding of f[14C]Met-tRNA to ribosomes were unaffected by this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1508200599,"Formate is utilized for mitochondrial polypeptide chain initiation, and formyl label is retained as N-formylmethionine in mitochondrial proteins. Chloramphenicol inhibits this incorporation of formate into mitochondrial proteins by more than 95% demonstrating the specificity of this labeling procedure. A second product derived from formate and appearing in mitochondrial proteins is represented by serine which is formed and incorporated in the cell sap. These two products can be distinguished either after complete enzymatic hydrolysis or, on the intact protein, by the acid lability of the formyl linkage. Proteins initiated, translated, and integrated into their final membrane sites within the mitochondria may therefore be identified by the lability of their formate label. These techniques should prove valuable in determining the site of synthesis of purified protein subunits without the use of inhibitors, as well as for studying inter-compartmental regulation of polypeptide synthesis. We have examined this question and now provide evidence for tight coupling between the mitochondrial and cell sap systems. Interruption of protein synthesis on cell sap ribosomes has no effect on polypeptide chain initiation in the mitochondria, yet the elaboration of complete membrane-associated proteins stops rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W1595324529,"The catalytically active form of bacterial glutamate decarboxylase has an absorption maximum at 420 nm due to the presence of the enzyme—pyridoxal 5′-phosphate Schiff base. Above pH 5.5 the absorption maximum is at 340 nm, and the enzyme is inactive. If the pH of a solution of the enzyme is rapidly changed from 6.5 to 4.0 in a stopped flow apparatus, the change in absorption spectrum occurs over a period of several seconds. The change is general acid catalyzed and occurs in two steps. The first is a rapid conformation change of the enzyme induced by the addition of 3 protons to the enzyme. The second is general acid catalyzed formation of the catalytically active form of the enzyme. If the pH of a solution of the enzyme is rapidly increased from 4.0 to 7.0, the rate of the change in absorption spectrum can also be measured. The change is not buffer catalyzed, but its rate increases rapidly with increasing pH. The mechanism of this change involves an initial rate-determining conformation change of the enzyme induced by dissociation of 3 protons, followed by rapid formation of the equilibrium high pH form of the enzyme. The rate of the conformation change can also be measured on enzyme which has been reduced by sodium cyanoborohydride. From the kinetics of the pH jump reactions and other factors we conclude that the high pH form and the low pH form of glutamate decarboxylase differ by a protein conformation change and by a change in the covalent structure of the bound coenzyme. At low pH the coenzyme is bound in the usual ketoenamine form. At high pH a sulfhydryl group of the enzyme adds to the aldehyde carbon forming an aldamine. Many anions affect the properties of glutamate decarboxylase. Chloride ion increases the rate of transformation of the high pH form of the enzyme into the low pH form and decreases the rate of transformation of the low pH form into the high pH form. These effects occur because anions are able to bind to the low pH conformation of the enzyme but not to the high pH conformation."
https://openalex.org/W3203781928,"Recent developments in biology and medicine are raising new problems in the prevention and treatment of birth defects, and in research on these diseases. The problems include immediate issues such as genetic counseling, abortion for birth defects, the withholding of complex treatments from individuals in some situations, screening for genetic and other diseases, artificial insemination, and fertilization in vitro. Other problems, such as the dysgenic effects of modern medicine and the possibilities of cloning and gene therapy, are more remote. Each of these issues should be considered on its own merits and by its immediate and remote consequences rather than by a priori absolute criteria. Ways must be found to deal with these issues in a manner acceptable to most human beings. Open discussions and freedom from coercion are the best guarantees for ultimate success. The ethical human brain is the highest accomplishment of biologic evolution. By harmonizing our scientific, cultural, and ethical capabilities, the potentially achievable results can place us at the threshold of a new era of better health and less human suffering."

https://openalex.org/W1490857600,"Abstract DNA-directed formation of RNA and protein was compared in subcellular systems in the absence or presence of Ca2+ ions. In the absence of Ca2+, messenger RNA was unstable, and protein and RNA accumulation tended to stop after incubations of 10 to 15 min at 37°. In contrast, in the presence of Ca2+ mRNA was stabilized almost completely. As a result, the net accumulation of RNA and protein continued for 20 to 45 min at 37°, and could be 3-fold greater, even though the rates of formation are lower. The fate of the RNA in the presence and in the absence of Ca2+ was detailed after limitation of synthesis by rifampicin, in DNA-coupled systems modified from those of Lederman and Zubay (Lederman, M., and Zubay, G. (1967) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 149, 253) or Gold and Schweiger (Gold, L. M., and Schweiger, M. (1971) Methods Enzymol. 20, 537). In the presence of Ca2+, little or no acid-soluble material was released during 30 min from RNA formed on T4, Escherichia coli, φ80, or λDNAs, and T4-specific mRNA extracted at various times and analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis showed no detectable cleavages to smaller sized chains. The implication that a number of ribonucleases are directly inhibited by Ca2+ ions was confirmed for two purified E. coli enzymes, the endonuclease RNase III and the exonuclease RNase II. Thus, Ca2+ ions provide an effective way to dissociate in vitro the physiological coupling of mRNA formation and translation from its degradation. In the absence of Ca2+, a number of features of mRNA metabolism in vivo could be reproduced. Chemical decay of E. coli and T4-specific mRNA was studied. As in vivo, decay of both types of mRNA was exponential. Also, the half-lives (2.25 min for E. coli and 4.45 min for T4 mRNA) were of the same magnitude and in the same ratio as in vivo. Furthermore, the response of mRNA metabolism to antibiotics was comparable to that in vivo; when protein synthesis was blocked by the addition of chloramphenicol, new mRNA was protected against decay, but when puromycin was used to block protein synthesis, mRNA still degraded rapidly."

https://openalex.org/W1585128609,"Abstract The reassociation of denatured subunits of l-asparaginase from Escherichia coli B was examined after dilution into buffer and into dilute urea solution. By gradually increasing the urea content of the reassociation mixture, we have attempted to elucidate the steps through which the denatured polypeptide reassembles into the catalytically active tetramer. Refolding of the chain is complete within 30 s after dilution of the denaturant and this is followed by a slower aggregation of the subunits into the oligomers. There was no evidence of dimers formed as intermediates in the reassembly process. The lone tryptophan which is present in the subunit is transferred from an aqueous to a hydrophobic environment during the refolding process while many of the tyrosyl residues undergo similar changes in their milieu as the subunits aggregate. l- and d-Asparagine are equally effective in inducing association of monomer to tetramer in the presence of urea and under assay conditions this process requires approximately 5 min. Both stereoisomers of aspartic acid are also partially effective in promoting aggregation; however, l-glutamine and glycyl-l-asparagine are rather ineffective as promoters of the assembly process."

Under conditions of synthesis, i.e. in the presence of deoxythymidinetriphosphate and Mg2+, ribouridylic acid residues are preserved during the extension of the primer in contrast to riboadenylic acid residues, which are excised by the 3' → 5' exonuclease activity. Thus, the error corrective function of DNA polymerase only discriminates mismatched from matched bases at the 3' terminus of the primer. Ribonucleotide residues are accepted as long as they allow classical base pairing with the template. In the absence of deoxythymidinetriphosphate, the 3' → 5' exonuclease activity is capable of cleaving both riboadenylic and ribouridylic acid residues from the 3' end of the primer."
