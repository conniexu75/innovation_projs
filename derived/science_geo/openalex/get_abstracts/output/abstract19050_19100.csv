https://openalex.org/W2131894799,"The multichain T cell antigen receptor functions by interacting with and activating one or more nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. The cytoplasmic tail of the ζ chain can activate T cells independently of the rest of the receptor complex. The function of the remaining invariant CD3 chains remains unknown. A 22-amino acid region of the cytoplasmic tail of CD3 ε was also able to independently activate T cells. Stimulation of T cells by means of the cytoplasmic tails of either ζ or CD3 ε resulted in quantitatively distinct patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting activation of different biochemical pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1599110926,"Integrins are a complex family of divalent cation-dependent cell adhesion receptors composed of one alpha and one beta subunit noncovalently bound to one another. A subset of integrins contains the alpha v subunit in association with one of several beta subunits (e.g. beta 3, beta 5, beta 1). We have recently identified a novel integrin beta subunit, beta 6, that is present in a number of epithelial cell lines. Using a polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of beta 6, we have now identified the integrin heterodimer, alpha v beta 6, on the surface of two human carcinoma cell lines. Using affinity chromatography of lysates from the pancreatic carcinoma cell line, FG-2, we demonstrate that alpha v beta 6 binds to fibronectin, but not to vitronectin or collagen I. In contrast, the alpha v beta 5 integrin, which is also expressed on FG-2 cells, binds exclusively to vitronectin. Immobilized collagen I does not interact with alpha v integrins, but binds beta 1-containing integrins. Both alpha v beta 6 and alpha v beta 5 are eluted from their respective immobilized ligands by a hexa-peptide containing the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). RGD is highly effective in the presence of Ca2+, somewhat less effective in Mg2+, and virtually inactive in Mn2+. These results suggest that alpha v beta 6 functions as an RGD-dependent fibronectin receptor in FG-2 carcinoma cells. In agreement with this notion, cell adhesion assays show that FG-2 cell attachment to fibronectin is only partially inhibited by anti-beta 1 integrin antibodies, implying that other fibronectin receptors may be involved. Taken together with recent reports on the vitronectin receptor function of alpha v beta 5, our results suggest that the previously described carcinoma cell integrin, alpha v beta x (Cheresh, D. A., Smith, J. W., Cooper, H. M., and Quaranta, V. (1989) Cell 57, 59-69), is a mixture of at least two different receptors: alpha v beta 5, mediating adhesion to vitronectin, and alpha v beta 6, mediating adhesion to fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1996441373,"We have identified a dominant fetal thymocyte population at day 14.5 of gestation in the mouse that lacks CD4 and CD8 but expresses Fc gamma RII/III several days prior to acquisition of the T cell receptor (TCR) in vivo. If maintained in a thymic microenvironment, this population of CD4-CD8-TCR-Fc gamma RII/III+ thymocytes differentiates first into CD4+CD8+TCRlowFc gamma RII/III- thymocytes and subsequently CD4+CD8-TCRhighFc gamma RII/III- and CD4-CD8+TCRhighFc gamma RII/III- mature Ti alpha-beta lineage T cells. However, if removed from the thymus, the CD4-CD8-TCR-Fc gamma RII/III+ thymocyte population selectively generates functional natural killer (NK) cells in vivo as well as in vitro. These findings show that a cellular pool of Fc gamma RII/III+ precursors gives rise to T and NK lineages in a microenvironment-dependent manner. Moreover, they suggest a hitherto unrecognized role for Fc receptors on primitive T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2035189704,"The products of the adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) gene are potent oncoproteins when tested in standard transformation and immortalization assays. Many of the changes induced by E1A may be due to its interaction with cellular proteins. Four of these cellular proteins are the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), p107, cyclin A, and p33cdk2. The pRB and p107 proteins are structurally related and have several characteristics in common, including that they both bind to the SV40 large T oncoprotein as well as to E1A. Cyclin A and p33cdk2 are thought to function in the control of the cell cycle. They bind to one another, forming a kinase that closely resembles the cell cycle-regulating complexes containing p34cdc2. Cyclin A is now shown to bind to p107 in the absence of E1A. The association of p107 with cyclin A suggests a direct link between cell cycle control and the function of p107."
https://openalex.org/W1553243256,"AUUUA multimers present in the 3'-untranslated region of mature lymphokine and cytokine transcripts have been implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability and translational efficiency. We have identified RNA-binding factors, termed AU-A, AU-B, and AU-C, that interact with AUUUA multimers. AU-A is an abundant, constitutively expressed 34-kDa factor that localizes primarily to the nucleus. AU-A binds to AUUUA multimers with low relative affinity and also binds to other U-rich sequences, including a poly(U) sequence. AU-B and AU-C are 30- and 43-kDa cytoplasmic factors that are induced following T cell receptor-mediated stimulation of purified human T cells and bind to AUUUA multimers with high affinity. Protease cleavage of AU-A, AU-B, and AU-C RNA-protein complexes indicate that AU-B and AU-C are structurally related to each other but distinct from AU-A. AU-B and AU-C require three or more tandem AUUUA repeats for efficient binding, and binding by these factors poorly tolerates mutations in the AUUUA recognition sequence. The precise binding specificity, high affinity, pattern of induction, and cytoplasmic localization all suggest that the structurally related AU-B and AU-C RNA-binding factors could be cytoplasmic regulators of lymphokine mRNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1513540500,"Increased plasma levels of the apoB-100-containing lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) are associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction, but the mechanisms by which lipoprotein(a) may accelerate these processes remain obscure. In this study we have investigated the impact of the association of apoprotein(a) with the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-like Lp(a) particle upon specificity of receptor recognition after lipoprotein modification by malondialdehyde or transition metal-induced oxidation. We have determined that radioiodination labels both apoprotein components of Lp(a), that malondialdehyde modification produces an anionic lipoprotein comparable to native Lp(a) in Stokes' radius, and that N,N'-disubstituted 1-amino-3-iminopropene derivatives preferentially cross-link apoprotein(a) to apoB-100 protein. Like LDL, native Lp(a) is recognized in human monocyte-macrophages by the LDL receptor. Like LDL, progressive modification of Lp(a) by malondialdehyde abolishes lipoprotein recognition by the LDL receptor and produces uptake and hydrolysis by the scavenger receptor of human monocyte-macrophages. We propose that intimal retention of Lp(a) by extracellular components of the atherosclerotic reaction places the lipoprotein in a microenvironment favoring subsequent peroxidative modification. The chronic production of lipid peroxide-modified Lp(a) together with unmitigated cellular clearance by scavenger receptors may contribute to the accumulation of lipoprotein-derived lipid in macrophage-derived foam cells of the atherosclerotic reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1647338923,"The vacuolar class of (H+)-ATPases are highly sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents, such as N-ethylmaleimide. The cysteine residue which is responsible for inhibition of the coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase upon modification by N-ethylmalemide is located in subunit A and is able to form a disulfide bond with the cysteine moiety of cystine through an exchange reaction. This unique property distinguishes this cysteine residue from the remaining cysteine residues of the (H+)-ATPase. Using this reaction, we selectively labeled the cystine-reactive cysteine residue of subunit A with fluorescein-maleimide. After complete digestion of the labeled subunit A by V8 protease, a single labeled fragment of molecular mass 3.9 kDa was isolated and the amino-terminal sequence was determined. This fragment contains 2 cysteine residues, Cys240 and Cys254. Since Cys254 is conserved among all vacuolar (H+)-ATPases whereas Cys240 is not, it is likely that Cys254 is the residue which is responsible for the sensitivity of the vacuolar (H+)-ATPase to sulfhydryl reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1564623388,"We have reconstituted biologically relevant transcriptional antitermination in vitro by the phage lambda N protein. This required the isolation of NusG, a newly identified Escherichia coli transcription elongation factor. NusG is encoded by an E. coli gene, formerly called U and now called nusG, in which a mutation affects antitermination by N in vivo. Efficient antitermination by N in our reconstituted system depends on the bacterial proteins NusG, NusA, NusB, and ribosomal protein S10 (which functions without ribosomes in transcriptional antitermination). In reactions containing E. coli S100 extract, NusG is stoichiometrically bound to lambda N-modified transcription elongation complexes. We used RNA polymerase affinity chromatography to show that NusG binds to the core component of E. coli RNA polymerase. This binding is weak, and the stable association of NusG with lambda elongation complexes additionally requires at least N, NusA, and the boxA component of an N utilization site. In reactions containing bacterial S100 extract, NusG and NusB are also present in elongation complexes transcribing E. coli boxA-containing rDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1538448197,"The plasma membrane Ca(2+)-pumping ATPase (Ca(2+)-ATPase) mRNAs are encoded on four different genes designated PMCA1-PMCA4. The primary transcripts from some of these genes are known to be alternately spliced in the region encoding the regulatory domains of the enzymes. The known alternately spliced forms of these Ca(2+)-ATPase mRNAs and a new spliced variant of PMCA4 (PMCA4b), presented here, represent at least nine different mRNAs encoding the Ca(2+)-ATPases. In this report, the examination of the tissue-specific distribution of these alternately spliced mRNAs using polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA coupled with Southern blotting revealed that each spliced variant had a unique tissue distribution. PMCA1b and PMCA4a were present in all tissues examined. PMCA1a, PMCA1b, and PMCA4b were expressed in excitable tissues, whereas PMCA1d was expressed only in muscle tissues. PMCA2 was found in liver, adrenal gland, spinal cord, and brain. PMCA3a was present in spinal cord, and PMCA3b in thymus, adrenal gland, spinal cord, and brain. The mRNA for a new spliced variant of PMCA4 (PMCA4b) was detected in this study. Complementary DNAs for this isoform were isolated and characterized from human and bovine brain. This alternately spliced form of the PMCA4 mRNA contained an exon inserted at the splice junction immediately following the sequence encoding the calmodulin-binding domain. As has also been shown for PMCA1a, this insertion produced a shift in the reading frame at the 3'-end of the PMCA4 mRNA that yielded a sequence encoding a Ca(2+)-ATPase lacking a large portion of the C-terminal regulatory domain. When the human PMCA4 gene spanning this region of variable exon splicing was sequenced, it confirmed the intron-exon boundaries where alternate splicing occurs to produce PMCA4a and PMCA4b."
https://openalex.org/W2092926963,"The biologically active photoproduct of rhodopsin, metarhodopsin II (M II), exists in a pH-sensitive equilibrium with its precursor, metarhodopsin I (M I). Increasing acidity favors M II, with the midpoint of the pH titration curve at pH 6.4. To test the long-standing proposal that histidine protonation regulates this conformational transition, we characterized mutant rhodopsins in which each of the 6 histidines was replaced by phenylalanine or cysteine. Only mutants substituted at the 3 conserved histidines showed abnormal M I-M II equilibria. Those in which His-211 was replaced by phenylalanine or cysteine formed little or no M II at either extreme of pH, whereas mutants substituted at His-65 or at His-152 showed enhanced sensitivity to protons. The simplest interpretation of these results is that His-211 is the site where protonation strongly stabilizes the M II conformation and that His-65 and His-152 are sites where protonation modestly destabilizes the M II conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1590719173,"The preprotein translocase of Escherichia coli is a multisubunit enzyme with two domains, the peripheral membrane protein SecA and the membrane-embedded SecY/E protein. SecY/E has been isolated as a complex of three polypeptides, SecY, SecE, and band 1. We now present four lines of evidence that the active species of SecY/E is composed of a tightly associated complex of these three subunits: 1) antibodies to SecY efficiently precipitate SecY/E activity as well as all three polypeptides; 2) the proportions of SecY, SecE, and band 1 in the immunoprecipitates are the same as in the starting fraction; 3) the immunoprecipitable complex is not disrupted by treatment with either high salt or urea but is disrupted by brief incubation at 20 degrees C, and the kinetics of dissociation of both band 1 and SecE from SecY at 20 degrees C parallel the loss of translocation ATPase activity; 4) upon immunoprecipitation of similar units of activity of translocase from detergent solutions from either wild-type membranes or a SecY and SecE overproducer strain, the SecE and band 1 subunits are recovered in the same proportions. These data establish that the subunits of SecY/E are firmly associated and that it is the associated complex which is active for translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1604419938,"A simple method to measure cytosolic calcium binding in intact presynaptic nerve terminals (synaptosomes) from rat brain, which is based on the simultaneous determination of [Ca2+]i and total [45Ca2+] in quin2-loaded synaptosomes undergoing a switch from high- to low-calcium containing medium, is presented. Binding to the cytosolic compartment alone was obtained following depletion of calcium storing organelles in the presence of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone/oligomycin plus caffeine. Synaptosomes, as compared to various cells types, have a high calcium binding capacity to the cytosolic compartment; maximum binding, Ca.Bmax, was 4.76 mM and calculated s0.5 was 218 nM. Calcium binding to the cytosolic compartment as a function of aging was also determined; Ca.Bmax was reduced to 1.84 mM and s0.5 increased to 492 nM in 30-month-old rats, indicating that the buffering of high calcium loads is impaired in old animals. The results obtained for binding of calcium to mitochondria and caffeine-sensitive calcium stores are consistent with an age-dependent reduction in calcium bound to mitochondria, whereas caffeine-sensitive calcium stores were unaffected. Finally, we have estimated the net rates of calcium extrusion in intact synaptosomes, and found that calcium efflux through the Na/Ca exchanger and Ca(2+)-ATPase was markedly reduced in old rats."

https://openalex.org/W1499159877,"The 1G7-antigen is expressed by the infective metacyclic trypomastigote stage of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The 1G7-antigen is a 90-kDa glycoprotein, present at about 40,000 copies/cell, which is anchored in the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor. The glycan of the GPI anchor has been isolated from immunopurified 1G7-antigen and its structure determined using a combination of methylation linkage analysis and exoglycosidase sequencing. The structure of the glycan is Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-4GlcNH2. The glucosamine residue is in glycosidic linkage to a phosphatidylinositol moiety. The penultimate nonreducing alpha-Man residue is substituted with phosphate, which is most likely part of an ethanolamine phosphate bridge linking the GPI anchor to the 1G7-antigen polypeptide. The glycan sequence was obtained from 1.1 nmol of glycoprotein isolated from a detergent lysate of whole cells. The procedures reported here represent a high sensitivity protocol for determining GPI glycan structures from small quantities of biological material. The structure of the 1G7-antigen GPI anchor is consistent with the conserved core structure of all GPI anchors analyzed to date and is similar to that of the T. cruzi lipopeptidophosphoglycan. The biosynthesis of GPI anchors and lipopeptidophosphoglycan in T. cruzi is discussed in the light of this structural homology."
https://openalex.org/W1548958598,"A model of rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase was refined at 2.7-A resolution by using two heavy atom derivatives for initial phasing and standard refinement procedures, including molecular replacement averaging about a 2-fold axis and dynamic simulation: final R-factor, 0.223 (no solvent modeling); RMS deviation from standard bond lengths and angles, 0.020 A and 3.6 degrees, respectively (all 8658 nonhydrogen atoms plus 36,953 reflections (F/sigma greater than or equal to 3) between 8- and 2.7-A resolutions); average of individually refined atomic B-factors, 40 A2 (all atoms) and 30 A2 (all atoms in domains I-III). An H-bonding scheme with 538 main chain H-bonds for the two monomers in the asymmetric unit and probable ligands for six uranyl ions in one heavy atom derivative is given. The monomer contains 42 strands/helices arranged into four alpha/beta-domains. Each of the first three domains contains an alpha 3 beta 4 alpha 1 motif, where the topology of beta 4 is 2,1,3,4:[arrows: see text] which is a topology not encountered in an extensive search among known protein structures. A spatial similarity is observed between corresponding residues in the three repetitions of this motif per monomer, but the minimal mutational distance between spatially corresponding residues is not statistically significant. The loop between the antiparallel strands in each of these domains is an important feature of the active site. In domain IV, beta-sheet topology is 2,1,3,4,5,6:[arrows:see text]. Noncovalent domain/domain interactions within the monomer are greatest between adjacent domains along the polypeptide chain, which are not substantially interdigitated and can be cleanly disengaged by altering the phi/psi torsional angles of three uniquely positioned residues in the model. The observed hierarchy of noncovalent interactions between structural units within the crystal, based on a semi-empirical paradigm, suggests that monomer-monomer contacts within the asymmetric unit are formed during growth of the lattice and provides a rationale for some of the diffraction characteristics of phosphoglucomutase crystals. An unusually deep crevice involving 58 residues is formed by the head-to-tail, twisted semicircular arrangement of the four domains of the monomer that places no atom more than 12 A from the water-accessible surface. The active site of the enzyme is extensively buried at the bottom of this crevice, at the approximate confluence of the four domains. Other features of the active site, including the surrounding helical dipoles, and the metal-ion binding pocket are described, together with structure/function comparisons with a number of other enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1649140242,"Fibrinogen/fibrin and its proteolytic fragments serve as potential adhesive substrates during thrombosis, wound healing, and cancer. In this report we examined the biological response of human melanoma cells exposed to fibrinogen and its naturally occurring plasmic breakdown products that are known constituents of the tumor stroma. Plasmin treatment of fibrinogen first results in fragment X, which is characterized by removal of the COOH-terminal portion of the alpha chain including an RGD sequence (A alpha 572-575). Further digestion leads to fragment D comprising primarily an intact COOH-terminal stretch of the gamma chain containing the platelet adhesion sequence HHLGGAKQAGDV. In a sensitive adhesion assay M21 human melanoma cells utilized integrin alpha v beta 3 to attach to all three of these ligands. However, only intact fibrinogen promoted significant cell spreading, while fragment X produced minimal spreading and fragment D promoted only adhesion. These results indicate that fibrinogen contains at least two alpha v beta 3-dependent adhesive sites and these promote distinct biological responses of human melanoma cells. The differential functional properties of these ligands directly correlate to their relative binding affinity for purified alpha v beta 3 as measured in a solid-phase receptor binding assay. These results provide evidence that a single integrin can promote distinct biological signals depending on the molecular nature of the ligand binding event."
https://openalex.org/W1512909384,"The signal transduction mechanisms involved in the regulation of phagocytosis are largely unknown. We have recently shown that in neutrophils, when IgG-mediated phagocytosis is stimulated by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenyl-alanine (fMLP), the enhanced ingestion is dependent on the increase in [Ca2+]i which results from ligation of Fc receptors by the IgG-coated target (Rosales, C., and Brown, E. (1991) J. Immunol. 146, 3937-3944). Now, we have studied the mechanism by which this rise in [Ca2+]i occurs. Aggregated IgG, the monoclonal antibody 3G8 (which recognizes Fc receptor type III), and insoluble immune complexes caused an increase in [Ca2+]i. The rise in [Ca2+]i induced by Fc receptor ligation was resistant to pertussis toxin. In contrast, fMLP induced a rise in [Ca2+]i which was inhibited by pertussis toxin. fMLP-induced [Ca2+]i was accompanied by an accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) which peaked by 15 s, and which was also abolished by pertussis toxin. IP3 accumulation after aggregated IgG, 3G8, or insoluble immune complexes was much less than after fMLP. Unlike [Ca2+]i rise induced by Fc receptor ligation, this small increase in IP3 was inhibited by pertussis toxin. These data demonstrated that the [Ca2+]i increase induced by Fc receptor ligation is not mediated by IP3. Immediate pretreatment of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils with optimal doses of fMLP also reduced subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i rise from thapsigargin, a sesquiterpene lactone tumor promoter that releases intracellular Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive stores without IP3 turnover. Similarly, to its effects on thapsigargin, fMLP inhibited the [Ca2+]i rise upon subsequent immune complex binding. Pretreatment of cells with immune complexes also prevented subsequent [Ca2+]i rise from thapsigargin and fMLP. These data demonstrate that IgG Fc receptor ligation and fMLP activation of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils use distinct signal transduction mechanisms to release Ca2+ from the same thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular pool. In contrast to fMLP, signal transduction for increased [Ca2+]i after Fc receptor stimulation does not involve a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, and is independent of IP3."
https://openalex.org/W1573476117,"We have previously demonstrated reassembly of a functional vacuolar (H+)-ATPase from clathrin-coated vesicles using the dissociated peripheral domain (V1) and the membrane-bound integral domain (V0) (Puopolo, K., and Forgac, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14836-14841). We have used this reassembly procedure to test the function of the 40-kDa subunit of the coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase. In the absence of V0, a fraction of the peripheral subunits reassemble into a V1 subcomplex which contains the 73-kDa A subunit, the 58-kDa B subunit, and the 34- and 33-kDa subunits but lacks the 40-kDa subunit. This subcomplex, which sediments with a mass of approximately 500 kDa, can be separated from the remaining monomeric subunits (and the 40-kDa subunit) by density gradient sedimentation. When dissociated with 0.36 M KI, 2.5 mM ATP, and 2.5 mM MgSO4, and added to membranes from which V1 has been dissociated, this V1(-40 kDa) subcomplex is able to reassemble with V0 to give a (H+)-ATPase with a proton pumping activity approximately half that obtained in the presence of the 40-kDa subunit. The undissociated subcomplex is not competent for assembly of a functional (H+)-ATPase. Interestingly, the monomeric fraction obtained from density gradient sedimentation contains the 40-kDa subunit but lacks the 34-kDa subunit. This monomeric fraction is nevertheless also able to assemble with V0 to give a functional proton pump. The V1V0 complexes assembled in the absence of either the 40- or 34-kDa subunits, while active, are not stable to detergent solubilization and immunoprecipitation, suggesting that both of these subunits play a role in stabilization of the (H+)-ATPase complex. Evidence for interaction between the 40- and 33-kDa subunits is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W1508886543,"In order to prepare a completely light-stable rhodopsin, we have synthesized an analog, II, of 11-cis retinal in which isomerization at the C11-C12 cis-double bond is blocked by formation of a cyclohexene ring from the C10 to C13-methyl. We used this analog to generate a rhodopsin-like pigment from opsin expressed in COS-1 cells and opsin from rod outer segments (Bhattacharya, S., Ridge, K.D., Knox, B.E., and Khorana, H. G. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 6763-6769). The pigment (lambda max, 512 nm) formed from opsin and analog II (rhodospin-II) showed ground state properties very similar to those of rhodopsin, but was not entirely stable to light. In the present work, 12 opsin mutants (Ala-117----Phe, Glu-122----Gln(Ala, Asp), Trp-126----Phe(Leu, Ala), Trp-265----Ala(Tyr, Phe), Tyr-268----Phe, and Ala-292----Asp), where the mutations were presumed to be in the retinal binding pocket, were reconstituted with analog II. While all mutants formed rhodopsin-like pigments with II, blue-shifted (12-30 nm) chromophores were obtained with Ala-117----Phe, Glu-122----Gln(Ala), Trp-126----Leu(Ala), and Trp-265----Ala(Tyr, Phe) opsins. The extent of chromophore formation was markedly reduced in the mutants Ala-117----Phe and Trp-126----Ala. Upon illumination, the reconstituted pigments showed varying degrees of light sensitivity; the mutants Trp-126----Phe(Leu) showed light sensitivity similar to wild-type. Continuous illumination of the mutants Glu-122----Asp, Trp-265----Ala, Tyr-268----Phe, and Ala-292----Asp resulted in hydrolysis of the retinyl Schiff base. Markedly reduced light sensitivity was observed with the mutant Trp-265----Tyr, while the mutant Trp-265----Phe was light-insensitive. Consistent with this result, the mutant Trp-265----Phe showed no detectable light-dependent activation of transducin or phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1663535755,"Vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic lesions are phenotypically different from those in the normal arterial wall, and no expression of macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor encoded by the proto-oncogene c-fms has been demonstrated in normal smooth muscle cells. In the present study, we demonstrated expression of c-fms and high affinity binding of M-CSF in smooth muscle cells isolated from an experimental rabbit model of arteriosclerosis (intimal smooth muscle cells), while no expression of c-fms was shown in medial smooth muscle cells. In the immunocytochemical analysis, both types of smooth muscle cells similarly reacted with an antibody specific to muscle cells (HHF 35) but did not react with an antibody specific to rabbit macrophages (RAM 11). In intimal smooth muscle cells, when cells were incubated with acetylated low density lipoproteins (LDL), the binding of acetylated LDL and foam cell formation were observed. In response to M-CSF, tyrosine-phosphorylation, as analyzed by the detection of anti-phosphotyrosine-reactive proteins, and an increased rate of cell proliferation were observed in intimal smooth muscle cells. These results indicated that intimal smooth muscle cells have the characteristics of monocyte-macrophages such as the expression of c-fms, which may be related to their proliferation and phenotypic conversion into foam cells in atheromatous lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1533986193,"Microtubule-based organelle transport is thought to be mediated by the force-generating proteins cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin. These motor proteins have been characterized based on their ability to associate with and translocate microtubules. We show here that cytoplasmic dynein is also present as a peripheral membrane protein of purified synaptic vesicles. The vesicle-associated cytoplasmic dynein is identified by its photo-induced cleavage in the presence of ATP and vanadate. Purified, soluble cytoplasmic dynein is competent to bind to vesicle membranes stripped of endogenous peripheral membrane proteins by alkaline pH. Dynein binding to membranes is saturable at a concentration of 1.00 +/- 0.15 pmol/micrograms vesicle protein and has a dissociation constant of 22.3 +/- 2.4 nM. The association of cytoplasmic dynein with the membrane cannot be reversed by incubation with ATP. Furthermore, following binding to membranes, dynein retains its ability to bind ATP and to be photo-cleaved in the presence of vanadate. The presence of cytoplasmic dynein on synaptic vesicles and its ability to bind to extracted membranes supports current models of microtubule-based organelle translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1561082371,"Addition of sodium fluoride in the millimolar concentration range to a solution containing the sarcoplasmic reticulum CaATPase undergoing turnover in its vesicular or nonionic detergent-solubilized forms produced a slow (time range of minutes) complete loss of enzymatic activity. In the presence of magnesium and the absence of calcium, similar results were obtained under nonturnover conditions. Time courses were adequately fit by a function corresponding to a monophasic transformation with a pseudo first order rate constant kobs. In the absence of Mg2+ (EDTA present) no inhibition developed; kobs depended hyperbolically on the Mg2+ concentration with the half maximal effect occurring near 4 mM. The fluoride concentration dependence of kobs showed no evidence of approaching saturation (highest [F-] used was 40 mM) and corresponded to a rate law which was approximately second-order with respect to fluoride. A number of ligands known to bind to the CaATPase were found to decrease kobs. Calcium prevented onset of fluoride inhibition with a midpoint in the micromolar range, implying an effect due to binding at the high affinity transport sites. ATP also protected with a midpoint in the micromolar range, consistent with an effect caused by active site binding of the nucleotide; protection was only partial, suggesting the ATPase can bind fluoride and ATP simultaneously. Prevention of fluoride inhibition by Pi occurred with a [Pi]1/2 of 12 mM at pH 6.5, a concentration similar to that which produces active site phosphorylation. Finally, protection by orthovanadate was found to be competitive and have a midpoint of 5 microM. These results point to an effect exerted at or near the phosphorylation site. The value of kobs increased from essentially zero above pH 8 to a plateau below pH 6; the transition had a midpoint near pH 7.2. Inhibition persisted after removal (with EGTA present) of unbound fluoride by dialysis. Reversal of fluoride inhibition was very slow, with a t1/2 of 16 h at 37 degrees C. These results suggest that fluoride behaves like a slow, tight-binding inhibitor of the ATPase and that the resulting complex is a stable transition (or intermediate) state analog. Plausible molecular bases for our results are that fluoride acts at the phosphorylation site as an analog of Pi or of hydroxide, which may be considered a substrate in the normal hydrolysis of the phosphorylated enzyme. A role for aluminum was ruled out after finding that the addition of EGTA to 10 mM or aluminum sulfate to 0.2 mM or deferoxamine to 0.5 mM produced no significant change in kobs."
https://openalex.org/W1602847006,"The hydrophobic domain of the signal peptide of OmpF-Lpp, a model secretory protein, was systematically engineered so as to be composed of different lengths of polyleucine residues or polymers with alternate leucine and alanine residues, and the effects of the length and nature of the hydrophobic stretch on the rate of in vitro translocation were studied using everted membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli. The translocation reaction exhibited high substrate specificity as to the number of hydrophobic residues. The results suggest that the hydrophobic domain is recognized specifically by a component(s) of the secretory machinery rather than nonspecifically by the hydrophobic region of the membrane. The in vitro translocation thus demonstrated required SecA and ATP and was markedly enhanced upon imposition of the proton motive force, as in the case of secretory proteins possessing a natural signal peptide. The highest translocation rate was obtained with the octamer in the case of polyleucine-containing signal peptides, whereas it was the decamer in the case of ones containing both leucine and alanine. These results suggest that the total hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic region of the signal peptides is an important determinant of the substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1516366497,"Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with a 4.0-kilobase macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) cDNA express two different M-CSF species; one has an apparent molecular weight of 85,000 and is identified as a homodimer of a 43-kDa subunit, and the other has an indeterminate structure greater than 200 kDa. In this study, we investigated the structure of the high molecular weight M-CSF by immunochemical procedures. The high molecular weight M-CSF was easily purified, since it bound tightly to DEAE-Sephacel and eluted at a characteristically high salt concentration. The high molecular weight M-CSF migrated as a diffuse band of over than 200,000 on nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Analysis of the same samples under reducing conditions revealed that the larger species consisted of a heteromer of the 43- and 150-200-kDa M-CSF subunits. Digestion of the 150-200-kDa M-CSF subunit with chondroitinase, which degrades the chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chain, yielded a 100 kDa band. This species was secreted instead of 150-200-kDa species when the cells were cultured in the presence of beta-D-xyloside, which inhibits the elongation of the chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chain in proteoglycans, providing additional evidence for the existence of a chondroitin sulfate chain in the 150-200-kDa M-CSF subunit. Removal of O- and N-linked carbohydrate from the 150-200-kDa subunit yielded a polypeptide chain with a larger molecular mass (approximately 45 kDa) than that of the 43-kDa subunit (approximately 25 kDa). Collectively, these results indicate that the 150-200-kDa M-CSF subunit is a proteoglycan with a core protein that may be an alternatively processed form of M-CSF."
https://openalex.org/W1515351996,"We have investigated the function of ATP hydrolysis in mammalian pre-mRNA in vitro splicing using adenosine phosphorothioates (ATP alpha S and ATP tau S) known to affect the activity of a number of ATP-requiring enzymes. Spliceosome assembly, but neither one of the two transesterification reactions involved in splicing, occurs with ATP alpha S suggesting that at least two types of ATP-requiring factors are brought into play. ATP alpha S has no effect in the presence of normal ATP and, therefore, spliceosomes assembled in the presence of ATP alpha S remain competent for splicing when supplied with normal ATP. ATP tau S noticeably and irreversibly inhibits the second transesterification reaction, i.e. at a time when most of the analog has been hydrolyzed and regenerated to normal ATP by creatine phosphate. This indicates that the inhibition results from an earlier event, most likely the thiophosphorylation of spliceosomal proteins. Under this assumption, the inhibition could be due to the failure of the thiophosphorylated proteins to be dephosphorylated. Indeed, okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases, inhibits the second step of a reaction in the presence of normal ATP. We propose that some splicing factors undergo phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles during spliceosome assembly and splicing, while others that could be the mammalian equivalents of the RNA helicase-like proteins recently discovered in yeast most likely bind and hydrolyze ATP."

Chloroform/methanol extraction of S. cerevisiae plasma membranes led to isolation of a low molecular weight proteolipid identical to that present in purified H(+)-ATPase. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed a 38-residue polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 4250 Da. The polypeptide lacks the first two NH2-terminal amino acids as compared with the deduced sequence of the PMP1 gene (for plasma membrane proteolipid) isolated by hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to an internal amino acid sequence of the proteolipid. The polypeptide is predicted to contain an NH2-terminal transmembrane segment followed by a very basic hydrophilic domain."
https://openalex.org/W1600361302,"To analyze the role of cytosolic cofactors in mitochondrial protein targeting, we prepared a chemically pure mitochondrial preprotein. When diluted out of 7 M urea, this precursor protein was efficiently imported into mitochondria without the addition of cytosolic cofactors. Extensive prewashing of mitochondria (up to 2 M KCl) did not reduce its import. Import of the purified precursor showed the characteristics of authentic mitochondrial import including use of the receptor MOM19, requirement for a membrane potential, and proteolytic processing. When the precursor was preincubated at a low concentration of urea, cytosolic cofactors were needed to preserve its import competence. We conclude that targeting of this preprotein via the mitochondrial master receptor MOM19 does not require a cytosolic signal recognition factor; cytosolic cofactors apparently have chaperone-like functions in mitochondrial protein uptake. Moreover, we found that a cleavable presequence was sufficient to direct protein import via MOM19. Together with the cofactor-independent function of MOM19, it is thus conceivable that MOM19 functions as mitochondrial presequence receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1503398446,"The interaction of 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) and TNP-ADP to F1-ATPase from a thermophilic bacterium PS3 (TF1) was investigated. When TNP-ADP or TNP-ATP was added to the isolated alpha or beta subunit of TF1, characteristic difference spectra were generated for each subunit. Difference spectra generated on addition of these analogs to TF1 resembled those observed for the beta subunit, indicating TNP analogs bind to the beta subunits in the molecule of TF1. Results of equilibrium dialysis showed that TNP-ADP binds to a single high affinity site on TF1 in the presence of Mg2+ with a dissociation constant of 2.2 nM. When TNP-ATP was added to TF1 in a substoichiometric molar ratio, it rapidly bound to TF1 and was slowly hydrolyzed. The hydrolysis proceeded nearly to completion without showing stable equilibrium between bound species of TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP. Similar to beef heart mitochondrial F1, this hydrolysis was greatly accelerated by the chase-addition of 100 microM ATP. However, the hydrolyzed product, TNP-ADP, remained bound on the beta subunit even after the chase."
https://openalex.org/W1548838445,"CD45, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in lymphocyte activation, consists of five isoforms generated by alternative mRNA splicing. The pattern of CD45 splicing depends upon cell type, state of activation, and thymic development. We previously showed that mouse B and thymocyte cell lines transfected with a human CD45 minigene construct appropriately splice the alternative exons, demonstrating the presence of trans-acting tissue-specific splicing factors. To study the regulation of CD45 alternative splicing, cells having different splicing patterns were transiently fused, and mRNA was analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Human B cells, normally producing only the largest CD45 mRNAs, could splice out the alternative exons after fusion with mouse thymocytes. In contrast, the splicing pattern of human T cell lines (smaller CD45 isoforms) was unaltered by fusion with mouse B cells. This suggests that cells expressing the smallest CD45 isoform contain negatively acting trans-factor(s) that allow the alternative exons to be skipped, and that the full length isoform containing all three alternative exons is the default pattern of splicing. In agreement, incubation of thymocytes or T cell subsets with cycloheximide increased mRNA corresponding to the larger isoforms. CD45 isoform expression can now be interpreted in terms of the presence or absence of negative regulatory trans-acting splicing factors."
https://openalex.org/W1619975851,"The major macromolecule on the surface of the protozoan parasite, Leishmania major, is a complex lipophosphoglycan (LPG), which is anchored to the plasma membrane by an inositol-containing phospholipid. A defect in LPG biosynthesis is thought to be responsible for the avirulence of the L. major strain LRC L119 in mice. In order to identify the nature of this defect we have characterized two truncated forms of LPG, which are accumulated in this strain, by one- and two-dimensional 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy, two-dimensional heteronuclear 1H-31P NMR spectroscopy, methylation analysis, and exoglycosidase digestions. The structures of these glycoinositolphospholipids, termed GIPL-4 and -6, are as follows: [formula: see text] The glycan moieties of GIPL-4 and -6 are identical to the anchor region of LPG, which is also substituted with a Glc-1-PO4 residue in approximately 60% of the structures. However, instead of being capped with chains of phosphorylated oligosaccharide repeat units, both glycan moieties terminate in Man alpha 1-PO4, suggesting that the defect in LPG biosynthesis is in the transfer of galactose to this residue to form the disaccharide backbone of the first repeat unit. These results indicate that the phosphoglycan moiety of LPG is essential for intracellular survival of the parasite and have implications for LPG biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1499873133,"The effect of two anti-CD45 (T200, LCA, Ly5) antibodies on the activation of the murine T-cell hybridoma 13.13 has been evaluated. These studies have been carried out in a system that did not require cross-linking or coclustering of antibodies. Activation of 13.13 cells with the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, 145.2C11, gave rise to rapid increases in intracellular calcium and interleukin-2 production. Additionally, within 1 min, phosphorylation on tyrosine of four major proteins of about 130,000, 110,000, 80,000, and 37,000 daltons could be seen. Pretreatment of the cells with the anti-CD45 mAb M1/89.18.7.HK markedly inhibited all three biological responses, while an alternate anti-CD45 antibody, M1/9.3.4.HL.2, had little effect. The two antibodies bound to CD45 with similar affinities, and no differences in the lateral mobility of antibody-CD45 complexes in the cell membrane were observed. The inhibition of activation of the cells by M1/89.18.7.HK was abrogated significantly both by the phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate and by excess M1/9.3.4.HL.2. If M1/89.18.7.HK was added to the 13.13 cells after they had already been activated with anti-CD3, it very effectively stimulated dephosphorylation of substrates that had been phosphorylated on tyrosines prior to adding the anti-CD45 antibody. These results indicate that the phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase activity of CD45 is critical to its biological function and that bivalent (i.e. uncross-linked) anti-CD45 antibodies can give rise to markedly different responses. One of the antibodies, M1/89.18.7.HK, appears to behave much like a receptor ligand and is able to activate the enzymatic activity associated with the CD45 transmembrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1515395750,"We previously demonstrated that nonesterified as well as esterified eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) inhibit U46619-induced platelet aggregation and [3H]U46619 specific binding to washed human platelets. It was also demonstrated that esterification of these fatty acids resulted in a decrease in the affinity of [3H]U46619 for the thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TXA2/PGH2) receptor. In order to investigate the specificity of this inhibition, the effects of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 on the function and binding of the platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptor were studied. It was found that neither 20:5n-3 nor 22:6n-3 (nonesterified or esterified) altered epinephrine-induced aggregation or [3H]yohimbine specific binding. Moreover, Scatchard analysis revealed that esterification with either 20:5n-3 or 22:6n-3 did not alter the dissociation constant for [3H]yohimbine binding. Modulation of the TXA2/PGH2 receptor by 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 was next evaluated using CHAPS- and digitonin-solubilized platelet membranes. [3H]SQ29,548 dissociation constants of 26.5 nM and 20.8 nM were measured for CHAPS and digitonin-solubilized membranes, respectively. Competitive binding experiments in these solubilized preparations revealed that 20:5n-3 or 22:6n-3 blocked [3H] SQ29,548 binding with IC50 values in the range of 6-15 microM, while concentrations of these fatty acids of up to 100 microM showed no effect on [3H]yohimbine binding. On the other hand, the IC50 values for inhibition of [3H] SQ29,548 binding by linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and gamma-linolenic acid (18:3n-6) were in the range of 150 microM. Furthermore, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-6 showed similar inhibitory effects on [3H]yohimbine binding. Finally, competition binding studies performed in a partially purified TXA2/PGH2 receptor preparation also demonstrated inhibition of [3H]SQ29,548 binding by 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3. Collectively, these findings support the notion that 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 can selectively and directly modulate TXA2/PGH2 receptor function, and that this mechanism of action may contribute to the antiplatelet activity associated with diets rich in these fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1554158004,"4,4'-bis(1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (Bis-ANS), an environment-sensitive fluorescent probe for hydrophobic region of proteins, binds specifically to the C-terminal domain of lambda repressor. The binding is characterized by positive cooperativity, the magnitude of which is dependent on protein concentration in the concentration range where dimeric repressor aggregates to a tetramer. In this range, positive cooperativity becomes more pronounced at higher protein concentrations. This suggests a preferential binding of Bis-ANS to the dimeric form of the repressor. Binding of single operator OR1 to the N-terminal domain of the repressor causes enhancement of fluorescence of the C-terminal domain bound Bis-ANS. The binding of single operator OR1 also leads to quenching of fluorescence of tryptophan residues, all of which are located in the hinge or the C-terminal domain. Thus two different fluorescent probes indicate an operator-induced conformational change which affects the C-terminal domain. The significance of this conformational change with respect to the function of lambda repressor has been discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1595139678,"In order to investigate possible structural changes associated with the coupling mechanisms of the Ca-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, we have utilized fluorescence resonance energy transfer between spectroscopic probes covalently bound to different domains of the ATPase. Using time-correlated single photon counting, we have directly measured the energy transfer efficiency between 5-[2-[(iodoacetyl)amino]ethyl]aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS), that is specifically bound to the B trypic fragment at cysteines 670 and 674 and acceptors covalently bound either near the nucleotide binding site, i.e. fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate at lysine 515, also on the B fragment, or maleimide-directed probes specifically located on the A1, tryptic fragment, i.e. 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-maleimide (DABmal) or fluorescein-5-maleimide (Fmal), probably at cysteines 344 and 364. All of these donor-acceptor pairs exhibit energy transfer both within and between Ca-ATPase molecules allowing us to investigate spatial relationships between the A1 and B domains and between different ATPase polypeptide chains. Differentiation between the intra- and intermolecular components of energy transfer was accomplished in two ways: 1) by comparing the transfer efficiencies in native membranes before and after detergent solubilization and 2) by reconstituting ATPase chains that have already been labeled with either the donor or acceptor chromophores. Using this approach, we find no significant change in the intramolecular transfer efficiency between any of these donor-acceptor pairs either upon binding of calcium to the high affinity sites or upon stabilization of the phosphoenzyme intermediate, indicating that there are no large structural changes within the B tryptic fragment or, alternatively, between the A1 and B fragments. With respect to intermolecular energy transfer, we observe no effect of calcium binding on the unliganded enzyme with either donor-acceptor pair. However, formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate results in a measurable increase in the transfer efficiency between IAEDANS and DABmal (or Fmal); this increase is reversible upon phosphoenzyme destabilization by subsequent addition of calcium. There is no corresponding change in the intermolecular component of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between IAEDANS and fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate, indicating that the change in fluorescence resonance energy transfer probably occurs as a result of reorientation of associated ATPase polypeptide chains with respect to one another."
https://openalex.org/W1543557663,"In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts bombesin stimulated the release of arachidonic acid in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Arachidonate levels were significantly elevated after only a 2-s stimulation with the agonist. Furthermore, by measuring the arachidonate content of cellular phospholipids after cell activation, it was shown that there was selective depletion from phosphatidylcholine over the same time course. The corresponding production of lysophosphatidylcholine suggested the involvement of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase A2. Initial arachidonic acid release was not dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium, not activated by treatment of the cells with thapsigargin, and was unaffected by down-regulation of protein kinase C activity, or by treatment of the cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine. These data strongly suggest that occupation of the bombesin receptor is closely coupled to activation of phospholipase A2 which results in the rapid release of arachidonic acid from phosphatidylcholine."
https://openalex.org/W1825499522,"In order to better understand why higher eukaryotic membrane proteins, in contrast to soluble proteins, are not readily expressed in Escherichia coli, the gene encoding the liver mitochondrial phosphate transporter (H+/Pi symporter) (Ferreira, G. C., Pratt, R. D., and Pedersen, P. L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 15628-15633), was subcloned into a plasmid (pFOG402) containing the alkaline phosphatase promoter and leader sequence. Although this system is highly efficient in overexpressing soluble mitochondrial proteins in E. coli, e.g. alpha and beta subunits of the liver ATP synthase, it fails to express the H+/Pi transporter. Expression is not obtained by truncation of the transporter gene from either the 3' or 5' end, by fusing the mature transporter gene to genes encoding either the alpha or beta ATP synthase subunits, or by using different expression plasmids. Significantly, the H+/Pi transporter is overexpressed in E. coli provided its cDNA is first truncated at the 3' end (carboxyl-terminal end) and fused to a cDNA fragment derived from the ATP synthase alpha subunit gene. In fact, progressive deletions from the 3' end of the transporter cDNA produce a ladder of increasingly overexpressed fusion proteins which account from the largest to the smallest for approximately 2.5-14% of the total bacterial cell protein. The minimal truncation necessary from the 3' end is 192 base pairs corresponding to 64 COOH-terminal amino acids. This corresponds to 20% of the transporter and involves removal of one of the six predicted membrane-spanning segments. In a variety of additional experiments designed to define the molecular basis for E. coli's inability to express the complete liver H+/Pi transporter, problems related to cell toxicity and transcription were ruled out. However, in vitro transcription-translation assays revealed that the complete transporter is readily expressed when eukaryotic, but not prokaryotic, ribosomes are present. Significantly, the fused transporter gene (i.e. Pi transporter cDNA truncated at the 3' end + ATP synthase alpha subunit cDNA) is expressed when prokaryotic ribosomes are present. These results support the view that the difficulty in expressing higher eukaryotic membrane proteins in bacteria may be related in some cases to a problem at the level of translation."

https://openalex.org/W1552845821,"We have used four mutant calmodulins to study the regulation of human erythrocyte Ca(2+)-ATPase by the calmodulin-dependent pathway; the conserved Glu at position 12 in each of the four Ca(2+)-binding domains of calmodulin (Glu31, Glu67, Glu104, or Glu140) was replaced by Ala. At pCa 7, where unmodified calmodulin maximally activates the erythrocyte Ca(2+)-ATPase, all four mutants stimulated Ca(2+)-ATPase activity to the same maximal velocity. However, the concentrations of mutant calmodulins required for half-maximal activation (KCaM) were significantly higher than that for unmodified calmodulin and were strongly dependent on the domain in which the mutated Glu was located; substitution in either the first or second Ca(2+)-binding domain had little effect (2-3-fold increase in KCaM), whereas substitution in either the third or fourth domain resulted in a dramatic, 25-71-fold increase in KCaM. The same order of sensitivity was observed when the Ca2+ dependence of enzyme activation was measured at a constant 100 nM concentration of mutant calmodulin. These data point to dramatic differences in the functional significance of the replacement of the Glu at position 12 in each of the four Ca(2+)-binding domains for activation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase. The 2 Glu residues located in the carboxyl-terminal half of calmodulin (particularly Glu140) are crucial for activation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase at physiologically significant Ca2+ concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1506485609,"Abstract The N-linked oligosaccharides on three lysosomal enzymes in Dictyostelium discoideum were found to contain mannose 6-phosphomethyl residues. We have identified and partially characterized a novel S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase that is probably responsible for the synthesis of this unusual diester from Man-6-P. The enzyme selectively methylates the phosphate group of Man-6-P (Km 4.3 mM). Glucose-6-P and fructose-1-P are relatively poor acceptors; however, the enzyme is inactive against a broad array of other phosphorylated compounds. Using model di-, tri-, and pentasaccharide acceptors that include portions of the three different branches of high mannose-type oligosaccharides, we found that the enzyme prefers terminal alpha 1----2-linked Man-6-P residues (Km 0.15-1.25 mM) found on the known phosphorylated branches. The enzyme is membrane bound, has a neutral pH optimum and cofractionates on sucrose gradients with GlcNAc-1-P transferase, which resembles its mammalian counterpart, and is, presumably, the first enzyme in the phosphorylation pathway. Based on the substrate specificity and colocalization with GlcNAc-1-P transferase, the phosphate methyltransferase is likely to be responsible for the generation of mannose-6-phosphomethyldiester on Dictyostelium oligosaccharides."

Nelsestuen (1988) [Biochemistry 27, 4946-4952 and ealier papers] provided a series of fragment 1 derivatives in which various nitrogen-containing side chains were N-acetylated and/or N-2,4,6-trinitrophenylated. In addition the des-[Ala-1,Asn-2]- and des-[Ala-1,Asn-2,Lys-3]-fragment 1 derivatives were prepared by limited enzymatic hydrolysis of fragment 1 using cathepsin C and plasmin, respectively. Quantitative studies on the Ca(II) binding of these proteins have been accomplished using 45Ca(II) equilibrium dialysis. Binding of these fragment 1 derivatives to phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine (PS/PC) vesicles (25:75) in the presence of Ca(II) ions has been studied using the light-scattering technique. Acylation of the 5 lysine residues of fragment 1 by the action of acetic anhydride (500-fold molar excess) in the presence of 75 mM Ca(II), pH 8.0, results in loss of positive cooperativity in Ca(II) binding (Scatchard plot) and an increase in the number of Ca(II) ions bound. The Ca(II)-dependent PS/PC binding of the acylated protein is reduced. Removal of 2 and 3 residues from the amino terminus likewise leads to loss of positive cooperativity in Ca(II) binding and reduced binding affinity to PS/PC vesicles. The important role of the amino-terminal 1-10 sequence is discussed. We conclude that positive cooperativity in Ca(II) binding is not a prerequisite for the Ca(II)-dependent binding of bovine prothrombin fragment 1 to PS/PC vesicles."

The immunoaffinity-purified complex appears to be a trimer of very similar or identical 70-kDa subunits. It is a novel extracellular matrix molecule as determined by its subunit composition, N-terminal amino acid sequence, and in vivo localization. It is distributed widely in basement membranes including those from muscle, nerve, and kidney. It is also present in connective tissue regions such as perineurium and perimysium. It has the unusual property that it is initially expressed very late in avian development near the time of hatching. This protein is found to copurified with integrin because it binds to the carbohydrate support in Sepharose. Hemagglutination assays with mono- and disaccharides show that it functions as a lectin with galactoside-binding specificity. This protein is also found to bind strongly and specifically to laminin at a site distinct from its lectin activity, but does not bind to fibronectin or type IV collagen. The protein appears to be conserved and is a common contaminant of many laminin preparations. We call this novel protein LBL for laminin-binding lectin."

The overexpressed enzyme colocalized with other acid hydrolases in the soluble fraction of vesicles in the lysosomal region of Percoll gradients. The sorting of other hydrolases was unaltered. We also prepared transformants with constructs that contain 22 (Hex 22-Inv), 70 (Hex 70-Inv), and 532 (Hex 532-Inv) amino-terminal amino acids from beta-hexosaminidase fused in frame with the coding sequence for the yeast SUC2 gene product, invertase. Fusion molecular masses were those expected for fully N-glycosylated proteins. Hex 22-Inv was rapidly (t1/2 less than 30 min) and quantitatively secreted. The others were slowly (t1/2 greater than 5 h) and partially secreted. Each expressed invertase activity. During growth, the invertase activity of Hex 70-Inv and Hex 532-Inv was retained to the same extent as that of endogenous lysosomal enzymes. Most of the Hex 70-Inv migrated in Percoll gradients with vesicles of intermediate density (d = 1.055), but a portion co-migrated with lysosomal enzymes at d = 1.08. Hex 70-Inv was sulfated, and its N-glycosides were resistant to endoglycosidase H, indicating Golgi processing. Hex 70-Inv and Hex 532-Inv, like endogenous lysosomal enzymes, were subject to developmentally induced secretion."
