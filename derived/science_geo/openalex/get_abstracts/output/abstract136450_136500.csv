https://openalex.org/W2062485439,"Semiconductor nanocrystals were prepared for use as fluorescent probes in biological staining and diagnostics. Compared with conventional fluorophores, the nanocrystals have a narrow, tunable, symmetric emission spectrum and are photochemically stable. The advantages of the broad, continuous excitation spectrum were demonstrated in a dual-emission, single-excitation labeling experiment on mouse fibroblasts. These nanocrystal probes are thus complementary and in some cases may be superior to existing fluorophores."

In comparison with organic dyes such as rhodamine, this class of luminescent labels is 20 times as bright, 100 times as stable against photobleaching, and one-third as wide in spectral linewidth. These nanometer-sized conjugates are water-soluble and biocompatible. Quantum dots that were labeled with the protein transferrin underwent receptor-mediated endocytosis in cultured HeLa cells, and those dots that were labeled with immunomolecules recognized specific antibodies or antigens."

https://openalex.org/W2167293805,"The proapoptotic Bax protein induces cell death by acting on mitochondria. Bax binds to the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC), a composite proteaceous channel that is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability. Immunodepletion of Bax from PTPC or purification of PTPC from Bax-deficient mice yielded a PTPC that could not permeabilize membranes in response to atractyloside, a proapoptotic ligand of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). Bax and ANT coimmunoprecipitated and interacted in the yeast two-hybrid system. Ectopic expression of Bax induced cell death in wild-type but not in ANT-deficient yeast. Recombinant Bax and purified ANT, but neither of them alone, efficiently formed atractyloside-responsive channels in artificial membranes. Hence, the proapoptotic molecule Bax and the constitutive mitochondrial protein ANT cooperate within the PTPC to increase mitochondrial membrane permeability and to trigger cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2013135033,"Analysis of transgenic mice expressing familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked mutations in the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have shown that motor neuron death arises from a mutant-mediated toxic property or properties. In testing the disease mechanism, both elimination and elevation of wild-type SOD1 were found to have no effect on mutant-mediated disease, which demonstrates that the use of SOD mimetics is unlikely to be an effective therapy and raises the question of whether toxicity arises from superoxide-mediated oxidative stress. Aggregates containing SOD1 were common to disease caused by different mutants, implying that coaggregation of an unidentified essential component or components or aberrant catalysis by misfolded mutants underlies a portion of mutant-mediated toxicity."

Thus, the PKB kinase PDK1 may be responsible for the phosphorylation of PKC isotypes. PDK1 phosphorylated the activation loop sites of PKCζ and PKCδ in vitro and in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)–dependent manner in vivo in human embryonic kidney (293) cells. All members of the PKC family tested formed complexes with PDK1. PDK1-dependent phosphorylation of PKCδ in vitro was stimulated by combined PKC and PDK1 activators. The activation loop phosphorylation of PKCδ in response to serum stimulation of cells was PI 3-kinase–dependent and was enhanced by PDK1 coexpression."

Nonlinear global simulations of instabilities driven by temperature gradients in the ion component of the plasma support the view that turbulence-driven fluctuating zonal flows can substantially reduce turbulent transport. Finally, the outstanding differences in the flow dynamics observed in global and local simulations are found to be due to profile variations."

https://openalex.org/W2012357103,"The Fas death receptor can activate the Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway through the receptor-associated protein Daxx. Daxx was found to activate the JNK kinase kinase ASK1, and overexpression of a kinase-deficient ASK1 mutant inhibited Fas- and Daxx-induced apoptosis and JNK activation. Fas activation induced Daxx to interact with ASK1, which consequently relieved an inhibitory intramolecular interaction between the amino- and carboxyl-termini of ASK1, activating its kinase activity. The Daxx-ASK1 connection completes a signaling pathway from a cell surface death receptor to kinase cascades that modulate nuclear transcription factors."

A simple forest fire model, which is an example of self-organized criticality, exhibits similar behavior. One practical implication of this result is that the frequency-area distribution of small and medium fires can be used to quantify the risk of large fires, as is routinely done for earthquakes."

https://openalex.org/W2085077505,"Fertilin, a member of the ADAM family, is found on the plasma membrane of mammalian sperm. Sperm from mice lacking fertilin β were shown to be deficient in sperm-egg membrane adhesion, sperm-egg fusion, migration from the uterus into the oviduct, and binding to the egg zona pellucida. Egg activation was unaffected. The results are consistent with a direct role of fertilin in sperm-egg plasma membrane interaction. Fertilin could also have a direct role in sperm-zona binding or oviduct migration; alternatively, the effects on these functions could result from the absence of fertilin activity during spermatogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2018480705,"The experimental fragmentation of landscapes of a natural ecosystem resulted in declines in the abundance and distribution of most species in the multispecies animal community inhabiting the landscapes and the extinction of many species. These declines caused the deterioration of the positive interspecific relation between local population abundance and distributional extent in this community. However, when patches were connected by habitat corridors, an immigration “rescue effect” arrested declines in both abundance and distribution and maintained the observed positive relation between them. These results demonstrate the importance of metapopulation dynamics and landscape connectivity for the persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes."

The subsequent evolutionary history of this agricultural symbiosis was inferred from phylogenetic and population-genetic patterns of 553 cultivars isolated from gardens of “primitive” fungus-growing ants. These patterns indicate that fungus-growing ants succeeded at domesticating multiple cultivars, that the ants are capable of switching to novel cultivars, that single ant species farm a diversity of cultivars, and that cultivars are shared occasionally between distantly related ant species, probably by lateral transfer between ant colonies."

Europa is most likely differentiated into a metallic core surrounded by a rock mantle and a water ice-liquid outer shell, but the data cannot eliminate the possibility of a uniform mixture of dense silicate and metal beneath the water ice-liquid shell. The size of a metallic core is uncertain because of its unknown composition, but it could be as large as about 50 percent of Europa's radius. The thickness of Europa's outer shell of water ice-liquid must lie in the range of about 80 to 170 kilometers."

The results presented here indicate that specialized cells are established along the dorsal-ventral midline of the developing eye by Notch-mediated signaling between dorsal and ventral cells, and that Notch activation at the midline plays an essential role both in promoting the growth of the eye primordia and in regulating eye patterning. These observations imply that the developmental homology between Drosophila wings and vertebrate limbs extends to Drosophila eyes."

It contains some of the oldest evidence of maritime-based economic activity in the New World. Recovered materials include a hearth, lithic cutting tools and flakes, and abundant processed marine fauna, primarily seabirds and fish.

https://openalex.org/W2058523721,"The mechanisms underlying visual motion detection can be studied simultaneously in different cell compartments in vivo by using calcium as a reporter of the spatiotemporal activity distribution in single motion-sensitive cells of the fly. As predicted by the Reichardt model, local dendritic calcium signals are found to indicate the direction and velocity of pattern motion but are corrupted by spatial pattern properties. The latter are canceled out by spatial integration, thus leading to a purely directional selective output signal in the axon. These findings attribute a specific computational task to the dendrites of visual interneurons and imply a functional interpretation of dendritic morphology."

CPG15, a protein regulated by synaptic activity, functions as a cell-surface growth-promoting molecule in vivo. In Xenopus laevis , CPG15 enhanced dendritic arbor growth in projection neurons, with no effect on interneurons. CPG15 controlled growth of neighboring neurons through an intercellular signaling mechanism that requires its glycosylphosphatidylinositol link. CPG15 may represent a new class of activity-regulated, membrane-bound, growth-promoting proteins that permit exquisite spatial and temporal control of neuronal structure."

The measurements indicate that Europa has a predominantly water ice-liquid outer shell about 100 to 200 kilometers thick and a deep interior with a density in excess of about 4000 kilograms per cubic meter. The deep interior could be a mixture of metal and rock or it could consist of a metal core with a radius about 40 percent of Europa’s radius surrounded by a rock mantle with a density of 3000 to 3500 kilograms per cubic meter. The metallic core is favored if Europa has a magnetic field.
https://openalex.org/W2323646327,"The mammalian D-type cyclins D1, D2, and D3 activate the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 in G1 and thereby promote the cell's commitment to enter S phase. To elucidate the extent of functional overlap among the D-type cyclins, we have examined several aspects of the least characterized member of this subfamily of G1 cyclin proteins, cyclin D3. Microinjection of cyclin D3-neutralizing antibody inhibited G1/S transition in human (IMR-90) and rat (R12) diploid fibroblasts, indicating that analogous to cyclins D1 and D2, cyclin D3 is essential for timely progression through G1. In contrast to cyclins D1 and D2, cyclin D3 was (i) ubiquitously expressed among a panel of 70 human cultured cell types; (ii) strongly upregulated upon induction of HL-60 leukaemia cells to differentiate; and (iii) accumulated to high levels in a wide range of quiescent cell types in mouse and human differentiated tissues. Complementary analyses of human biopsies and mouse tissues at different stages of foetal and postnatal development revealed lineage-dependent transient or long-term accumulation of the cyclin D3 protein, correlating with initiation/establishment or maintenance of the mature phenotypes, respectively. Our data support the notion that the biological roles of the individual D-type cyclins are not fully redundant, and suggest a possible dual role for cyclin D3 in cell proliferation and induction and/or maintenance of terminal differentiation."

If these peridotites are residues from magmatism during the initiation of subduction 40 to 48 million years ago, then the mantle that melted was much more depleted in incompatible elements than the source of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB). This result indicates that osmium isotopes record information about ancient melting events in the convecting upper mantle not recorded by incompatible lithophile isotope tracers. Subduction zones may be a graveyard for ancient depleted mantle material, and portions of the convecting upper mantle may be less radiogenic in osmium isotopes than previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W2079803299,"The major barrier to transplantation across discordant species, such as from pig to human, is rejection mediated by xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNA) that bind the carbohydrate epitope Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R (αGal) on donor tissues. This epitope is synthesized by the enzyme glucosyltransferase uridine 5′-diphosphate galactose:β- d -galactosyl-1,4- N -acetyl- d -glucosaminide α(1-3)galactosyltransferase (E.C. 2.4.1.151), or simply αGT. When a functional αGT gene was introduced by retroviral gene transfer into bone marrow cells, αGal XNA production in a murine model ceased. Thus, genetic engineering of bone marrow may overcome humoral rejection of discordant xenografts and may be useful for inducing B cell tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1974049199,"Previously, a Bcl-2-interacting protein, BAG-1, was cloned from mouse cells and was shown to interact with several other proteins and to be important for inhibition of apoptosis. Human BAG-1 (hBAG-1) cDNA, recently isolated by us and two other groups, has been shown to be identical to a hormone receptor-binding protein, RAP46. However, different molecular masses of hBAG-1 protein products were noted by these three groups. Here we demonstrated that hBAG-1 protein was expressed as four isoforms, designated p50, p46, p33 and p29, with apparent molecular masses of 50 kDa, 46 kDa, 33 kDa and 29 kDa, respectively. Deletion, site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro transcription/translation analysis showed that the four protein products of hBAG-1 were expressed by alternative initiation from four different start codons through a leaky scanning mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the distinct forms of hBAG-1 have different subcellular localizations, suggesting that they may have distinct functions in the cells. Characterization of hBAG-1 RNA and protein also showed that hBAG-1 was overexpressed in human cervical, breast and lung cancer cell lines. Taken together, these data clarify the conflicting observations reported in the literature and suggest that hBAG-1 is expressed as four forms of protein products, which may play a differential role in apoptosis and oncogenesis of human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2021568924,"Homeostasis in colonic epithelial cells is regulated by the balance between proliferative activity and cell loss by apoptosis. Because epithelial cells at the apex of colonic crypts undergo apoptosis and proliferative activity is usually restricted to the base of the crypts, it has been proposed that the limited availability of growth factor-signals at the upper portions of the crypts may trigger apoptosis. In the present studies, we investigate the mechanism of apoptosis mediated by growth factor deprivation in colorectal carcinoma cells by delineating the possible involvement of Bax and its subcellular localization. We report that inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity and downregulation of EGFR by anti-EGFR mAb 225 induces apoptosis in human colorectal carcinoma DiFi and FET cells. Induction of apoptosis was preceded by enhanced expression of newly synthesized Bax protein, and required protein synthesis. In the mAb 225-treated cells, Bax was redistributed from the cytosol to the nucleus and subsequently, to the nuclear membranes. The observed induction of Bax expression by mAb 225 was not associated with p53 induction. However, mAb 225 treatment also triggered relocalization of p53 from the cytosol to a nuclear membrane-bound form. Induction of Bax and its redistribution to the nucleus of DiFi cells during apoptosis was also demonstrated in response to butyrate, a physiological relevant molecule in colonic epithelial cells as it is the principal short-chain fatty acid produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber in colonic epithelium. Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we observed that Bax is predominantly localized in the cytosol, but during apoptosis it is localized both inside and along the nuclear membrane. Taken together, these findings suggest that apoptosis induced by growth factor-deprivation or butyrate may involve the subcellular redistribution of Bax in human colorectal carcinoma cells."

A matrix assembled from native FN stimulated cell growth. In contrast, a mutant FN (FNΔIII1–7) that contains all known cell binding motifs but forms a structurally distinct matrix inhibited progression from G0/G1 into S phase.

In tissues and tumors, cells live within a multidimensional fibrillar extracellular matrix. The surrounding matrix fibrils thus are uniquely poised to supply environmental signals to cells, suggesting that the structural organization of the matrix itself contributes to the control of cell behavior. Extracellular matrix regulation of cell adhesion, migration, and gene expression occurs through binding to integrins and other cell surface receptors (1Hynes R.O.

In particular, a recombinant FN, FNΔIII1–7, that contains all known cell binding sites but lacks the first seven type III repeats (Fig. 1 A) exhibits an altered rate of matrix assembly with unique intermediates as compared with native FN (11Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). FNΔIII1–7 and FN matrices also differ in their capacities to re-organize the actin cytoskeleton (12Sechler J.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1997; 4: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that the structurally distinct architecture of native and altered FN matrices may have significantly different intracellular consequences. Matrix engagement of specific receptors represents an important control point for determining cell shape, cytoskeletal geometry, and the organization of intracellular components (13Folkman J.

FN matrices with distinct morphologies had opposite effects on cell growth by specifically altering the rate of G0/G1 to S phase progression. These effects required FN fibril formation demonstrating that the structure of the matrix plays an active role in modulating cell signaling. SVT2 (SV40-transformed 3T3) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% calf serum. Growth conditions for CHOα5 cells and expression and purification of pFN and recombinant FNs were as described previously (11Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). FNΔIII1–2 is a baculovirus-expressed full-length recombinant FN lacking the first two type III repeats. SVT2 and CHOα5 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells in either four-well (Nunc) plastic chamber slides (for SVT2 cells) or 24-well dishes with glass coverslips (CHOα5), allowed to attach and spread for 16–24 h, then incubated in serum-free medium for 16–22 h to obtain a population of cells in G0. As is the case for most transformed cell lines, serum starvation was not sufficient to totally synchronize SVT2 or CHOα5 cells but did enrich a G0 population as determined by propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis. For synchronization at G1/S, CHOα5 and SVT2 cells were seeded in 24-well dishes at a concentration of 2.5 × 105cells/well. After a 16-h incubation in complete medium, SVT2 cells were cultured with 0.5 mm hydroxyurea for 14 h and CHOα5 cells in 1 mm hydroxyurea for 18 h to synchronize cells at late G1/S phase. Cells were released from hydroxyurea, washed, and refed with complete medium containing FN-depleted serum and 50 μg/ml pFN or FNΔIII1–7. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (Cycle Test Plus DNA Reagent Kit, Becton Dickinson), and 3 × 104 cells were analyzed by FACS 10 h after release from hydroxyurea to monitor progression through S phase and G2/M. A set of nonsynchronized cells and cells after hydroxyurea incubation were also stained and analyzed by FACS using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). After synchronization, cells were transferred into complete medium containing FN-depleted serum plus 50 μg/ml pFN, 50 μg/ml FNΔIII1–7, or other recombinant FNs or without added FN. For the mixture of FNΔIII1–7 with pFN, 50 μg/ml of each protein were added. For 70-kDa inhibition of fibril formation, 50 μg/ml pFN or FNΔIII1–7 was mixed with 250 μg/ml 70-kDa fragment. Cells were allowed to assemble FN matrix for the indicated time periods. For immobilized proteins, 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml pFN or FNΔIII1–7 for BrdUrd incorporation or 5, 10, and 15 μg/ml for adhesion. Serum-starved CHOα5 cells were trypsinized and plated onto coated wells at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/well and then cultured in medium containing FN-depleted serum for a 10–20 h time course. BrdUrd was added to a final concentration of 10 μm and incubated for 30 min. BrdUrd-positive cells were detected with an anti-BrdUrd antibody followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed with nitro blue tetrazolium and X-phosphate substrate solution (Boehringer Mannheim). The numbers of total and BrdUrd-positive cells were counted for several fields (750–1000 total cells) and the percentage of positive cells calculated. Alternatively, cells were labeled with 10 μmBrdUrd and processed for ELISA using BrdU Detection Kit III and ABTS substrate (Boehringer Mannheim). Plates were read on a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm with a reference wavelength of 490 nm. For adhesion, serum-starved CHOα5 cells were trypsinized and plated at a concentration of 2 × 105cells onto a 48-well dish coated with either 10 μg/ml pFN or 10 μg/ml FNΔIII1–7. Cells were lysed (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 9 h after plating. For matrix assembly, CHOα5 cells were seeded, serum-starved, and incubated with FNs. Cells were lysed as described 3, 9, 16 and 24 h after release from serum-free medium. The concentration of total protein in each lysate was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). 30 μg/lane of total protein was separated by 6% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked overnight in 5% bovine serum albumin, Buffer A, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PT66 (Sigma) at a concentration of 1:3000. For adhesion, blots were developed by ECL (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film. For matrix assembly, blots were incubated with 125I-protein A then analyzed and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager as described (11Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The level of phosphorylation after serum starvation (time 0) was set to 1.0, and all other values are expressed relative to that value. p130 was detected by immunoprecipitation of 150 μg of total cell lysates with 20 μg of polyclonal anti-p130 antibody (Santa Cruz). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and the level of phosphorylation detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PT66 and developed by ECL. Native FN and FNΔIII1–7 matrices have markedly different effects on cell proliferation as shown in Fig. 1 B. CHOα5 cells, which fail to synthesize a FN matrix (11Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), were serum-starved to obtain an enriched population of quiescent cells in G0. Cells were then released from serum-free conditions and incubated with medium containing native pFN, baculovirus-expressed mutant FNΔIII1–7, or no exogenous FN. During the incubation, CHOα5 cells bind and assemble exogenous FN into a fibrillar matrix at the cell surface (11Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Labeling of newly synthesized DNA by incorporation of BrdUrd was then used to monitor cell cycle progression. Compared with cells without FN matrix, pFN stimulated and FNΔIII1–7 inhibited entry into S phase (Fig. 1 B). Twice as many cells with a native FN matrix were BrdUrd-positive 16 h after release from serum-free conditions as compared with cells with FNΔIII1–7 matrix (Fig. 1 C). With native FN matrix, cells entered S phase at least 8 h earlier than cells with FNΔIII1–7 matrix. Cells with no FN matrix progressed into S phase at a rate intermediate to native FN and FNΔIII1–7. BrdUrd incorporation by cells with a full-length recombinant FN matrix was the same as cells with pFN, indicating that differences in growth were not due to the source of the baculovirus-expressed recombinant protein. Not only does FNΔIII1–7 matrix inhibit cell growth, it also suppresses the stimulatory effects of native FN. A matrix composed of equal proportions of pFN and FNΔIII1–7 reduced BrdUrd incorporation by 30% relative to cells in the presence of native FN matrix (Fig. 1 D). This result shows that the FNΔIII1–7 matrix has a dominant-negative effect on growth stimulation by native FN. FNΔIII1–7 matrix also slowed the proliferation of SVT2 cells that assemble a matrix using endogenously produced FN (Fig. 2 A). Incubation of cells with exogenous pFN or FNΔIII1–7 results in co-assembly with endogenous SVT2 FN as well as a significant increase in the overall level of matrix-associated FN (9Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The G0 to S phase interval of SVT2 cells with FNΔIII1–7-containing matrix was 4 h longer than that of cells assembling a pFN matrix, suggesting a dominant inhibitory effect of the FNΔIII1–7matrix on cell growth. Morphologically, SVT2 cell matrices containing pFN and FNΔIII1–7 are distinct. Immunofluorescence staining of cells with exogenous pFN shows an ordered fibrillar matrix (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, FNΔIII1–7 matrix appears less uniform and is characterized by fibrils of varying length and thickness (Fig. 2, C and D). Together, these results demonstrate that co-assembly of FNΔIII1–7 with SVT2 FN has a dominant-negative effect on cell growth and, as with CHOα5 cells, this effect correlates with differences in matrix fibril organization. The effects of matrix assembly on cell growth are restricted to events controlling G0/G1 progression. CHOα5 and SVT2 cells synchronized at G1/S with hydroxyurea were released into complete medium containing pFN, FNΔIII1–7, or no FN and stained with propidium iodide to monitor DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression by FACS analysis. Neither native FN or FNΔIII1–7 matrix altered the progression of cells through S or G2/M as the percentages of cells traveling through these phases and back to G1 were identical (not shown). pFN and FNΔIII1–7 both contain all known cell binding sites and both use α5β1 integrin to initiate matrix assembly (11Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Fogerty F.J. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Mosher D.F. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet the two types of matrices have opposite effects on cell growth. Cell proliferation would be affected if there are different levels of integrin-mediated binding and adhesion to these two FNs (16Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 17Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 20Renshaw M.W. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, attachment and growth of CHOα5 cells on immobilized pFN or FNΔIII1–7protein were measured. Equal numbers of cells attached to pFN and FNΔIII1–7 substrates in 30 min (not shown). Attached cells showed identical levels of BrdUrd incorporation on the two proteins (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, cell adhesive interactions with native and mutant FNs are indistinguishable. An alternative explanation for the opposite growth responses is that the distinct architectures of the two matrices may influence cell proliferation. If fibrillar matrix structure controls the rate of growth, then inhibition of fibril formation should eliminate the differences between native FN and FNΔIII1–7 matrices. Inclusion of excess 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of FN during matrix assembly blocks FN-FN interactions via the assembly domain (see Fig. 1 A) thus preventing fibril formation by pFN (6McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 7McDonald J.A. Quade B.J. Broekelman T.J. LaChance R. Forsman K. Hasegawa E. Akiyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2957-2967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and FNΔIII1–7(11Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). 70-kDa fragment does not interfere with FN-integrin interactions. Inhibition of fibril formation by addition of 70-kDa fragment reversed the growth stimulatory effects of native FN matrix and the inhibitory effects of FNΔIII1–7 matrix (Fig. 3 B). In both cases, a block in fibril assembly resulted in BrdUrd incorporation comparable with that of cells with no matrix. Further evidence for the role of fibrillar matrix structure in regulating cell growth was provided by experiments with two other mutant recombinant FNs, FNΔIII1–2 and FN(syn-). FNΔIII1–2 is defective in FN binding and polymerization, 2J. L. Sechler and J. E. Schwarzbauer, unpublished observations. while FN(syn-) does not bind well to α5β1 integrin (21Sechler J.L. Corbett S.A. Schwarzbauer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2563-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As a result of these defects, each can only form short fibrils but cannot assemble into an extensive matrix of the type shown in Fig. 2. Cells grown in the presence of either of these two mutant FNs progressed into S phase at a rate similar to cells with no FN matrix (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate that the differential effects of native FN and FNΔIII1–7 on cell growth occur only when each is interacting with cells from within a fibrillar matrix. More importantly, the opposite effects of these FNs on cell proliferation are directly attributable to the structural differences between native FN and FNΔIII1–7 matrix fibrils. Cell interactions with FN activate a number of intracellular signal transduction cascades (2Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 22Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 23Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In particular, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) is an early biochemical response to integrin-mediated adhesion to FN substrates (24Guan J.L. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 951-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 25Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1992; 89: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). If FNΔIII1–7 matrix structure can perturb cell cycle progression, then intracellular signaling in response to matrix should be affected. Phosphorylation levels of pp125FAK were compared in cells assembling different fibrillar matrices. Cells assembling native FN matrix exhibited a 1.5–2-fold increase in pp125FAK phosphorylation over cells with either no FN or FNΔIII1–7 matrix (Fig. 4 A). The differential effects of these matrices were maintained even at the earliest time point where a transient increase in pp125FAK phosphorylation was observed under all three conditions, probably due to the addition of serum (2Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). The high levels of phosphorylation in response to native FN matrix were sustained throughout the entire time course. However, pp125FAK phosphorylation in cells with FNΔIII1–7 matrix remained low until the 24-h time point when it gradually increased to within 1.5-fold of levels with pFN (Fig. 4 A). In contrast to the effects of fibrillar matrix assembly, cell adhesion on immobilized pFN or FNΔIII1–7protein resulted in a rapid phosphorylation of pp125FAK to equivalent levels (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, on both substrates, pp125FAK phosphorylation was transient with obvious decreases after 3 h. A second focal adhesion protein, p130 (27Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), did not exhibit differential phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). p130 phosphorylation was transient, and comparable levels were observed with both pFN and FNΔIII1–7 during matrix assembly and cell adhesion. Therefore, cell interactions with fibrillar matrix elicit specific responses that are not observed with cell binding to immobilized protein substrates. Similar to the stimulatory effect on cell proliferation, native FN matrix induced pp125FAKphosphorylation. FNΔIII1–7 matrix, on the other hand, inhibited both pp125FAK phosphorylation and cell cycle progression. Clearly, the structure of the FN matrix can regulate receptor signaling and downstream pathways. Matrix architecture could regulate the induction of cell proliferative signals by modulating the spatial distribution of FN′s cell binding sites. As shown here, a network of matrix fibrils can vary the degree of proliferation allowing different matrix structures to stimulate, inhibit, or maintain cell growth rates. Inhibition of smooth muscle cell growth by treatments that can block FN fibril formation has also been reported (29Mercurius K.O. Morla A.O. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By placing unique three-dimensional structural constraints on the disposition of integrins, FN matrix fibrils could act from all sides of the cell to specify the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal geometry plays a central role in activating intracellular signaling pathways that lead to cell cycle progression (14Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar, 30Bohmer R.M. Scharf E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and inhibition of pp125FAK localization to focal adhesions correlates with decreased cell proliferation (31Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Thus reorganization of the cytoskeleton by specific alterations in matrix structure would ultimately influence cell growth. This concept is reinforced by the correspondence between differences in actin stress fiber arrangements and distinct native FN and FNΔIII1–7matrix structures (12Sechler J.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1997; 4: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Extracellular matrix rigidity can modify the strength of connections between integrins and the cytoskeleton (32Choquet D. Felsenfeld D.P. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) and may constitute another link between matrix architecture and cell growth control. Interestingly, our results also show that altering the structure of the FN matrix can be more detrimental than having no matrix at all. pFN polymers have been shown to have antimetastatic activity (33Pasqualini R. Bourdoulous S. Koivunen E. Woods Jr., V.L. Ruoslahti E. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and they may be acting through effects on matrix organization. Thus the design of reagents that can modify existing matrix architecture through dominant-negative effects could be a novel strategy for controlling cell and tumor growth and spread. We thank Drs. Mark Ginsberg, Arnold Levine, Bonnie Bassler, and Ruth Steward for critical reading of the manuscript and Drs. Siobhan Corbett and Stuart Emanuel for helpful discussions.

Meiosis differs instead in the mechanism that controls removal of the Cdk inhibitor Sic1. Destruction of Sic1 and activation of a Clb5-dependent kinase in meiotic cells required the action of the meiosis-specific protein kinase Ime2, thereby coupling early meiotic gene expression to control of DNA replication for meiosis."

Since there are no published data on EMS1 expression in large series of breast cancers we examined the relationship of EMS1 expression with EMS1 gene copy number and expression of mRNAs for cyclin D1 and ER. In a subset of 129 patients, where matched tumour RNA and DNA was available, EMS1 mRNA overexpression was associated predominantly with gene amplification (P = 0.0061), whereas cyclin D1 mRNA overexpression was not (P = 0.3142). In a more extensive series of 351 breast cancers, there was no correlation between cyclin D1 and EMS1 expression in the EMS1 and cyclin D1 overexpressors (P = 0.3503). Although an association between EMS1 mRNA expression and ER positivity was evident (P = 0.0232), when the samples were divided into quartiles of EMS1 or cyclin D1 mRNA expression, the increase in the proportion of ER positive tumours in the ascending EMS1 mRNA quartiles was not statistically significant (P = 0.0951). In marked contrast there was a significant stepwise increase in ER positivity in ascending quartiles of cyclin D1 mRNA (P = 0.030). A potential explanation for this difference was provided by the observation that in ER positive breast cancer cells oestradiol treatment resulted in increased cyclin D1 gene expression but was without effect on EMS1. The relationship between EMS1 expression and clinical outcome was examined in a subset of 234 patients with median follow-up of 74 months. High EMS1 expression was associated with age > 50 years (P = 0.0001), postmenopausal status (P = 0.0008), lymph node negativity (P = 0.019) and an apparent trend for worse prognosis in the ER negative subgroup. These data demonstrate that overexpression of EMS1 mRNA is largely due to EMS1 gene amplification, is independent of cyclin D1 and ER expression and, in contrast to cyclin D1, is not regulated by oestrogen. Independent overexpression of these genes may confer different phenotypes and disease outcomes in breast cancer as has been inferred from recent studies of EMS1 and CCND1 gene amplification."
https://openalex.org/W2328687205,"Terminal differentiation requires cell cycle withdrawal, suggesting the involvement of negative cell cycle controllers in the process. We have analysed the involvement of the retinoblastoma family of proteins (pRb, p107 and p130) in epidermal proliferation and differentiation. These proteins play key roles as inhibitors of cell cycle progression and are involved in muscle and neuron differentiation. We found that during in vitro differentiation of human HaCaT keratinocytes, pRb, p107 and p130 are sequentially expressed, in contrast to the co-expression observed during cell cycle progression in the same cells. Immunofluorescence studies on skin sections revealed the presence of pRb and p107 in basal and suprabasal cell layers, whilst p130 is restricted to cells already committed to differentiation in the suprabasal compartments. To explore the functional significance of the differential expression of these proteins, transfection experiments were performed in HaCaT keratinocytes. We observed that the forced over-expression of pRb, p107 or p130 individually did not induce differentiation of the transfected cells. However, the co-transfection of pRb and p107 induced the expression of early differentiation markers (keratin k10) and triple transfectants pRb+p107+p130 expressed markers representative of later stages of epidermal differentiation (involucrin). Finally, we observed that these three proteins repress keratinocyte proliferation, although to a different extent (p107>pRb> or =p130). These results indicate that the members of the pRb family play specific, yet coordinated roles during epidermal differentiation, and that the ordered progression along the different stages of this process results from the effects of different combinations of these proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2312394405,"The small GTP-binding Rho proteins control a variety of biological activities, including organization of the actin cytoskeleton, regulation of gene expression and cellular transformation. In contrast, Ras proteins do not induce actin stress fibers, but potently transform cells which exhibit a morphology clearly distinct from that caused by activated forms of Rho. To investigate whether nuclear signaling and oncogenic potential of Rho are a consequence of its profound effect on cytoskeletal organization, we replaced each amino acid in the Rho effector loop with those of Ras, or replaced conserved residues with others known to result in differential signaling capability when introduced into Ras and Rac1. These Rho mutants did not gain the ability to induce the MAPK, JNK or p38 pathways but, surprisingly, all Rho effector loop mutants still continued to induce actin stress fiber formation. However, three of these Rho mutants, with substitutions of leucine-39, glutamic acid-39, or cysteine-42, lost the ability to stimulate gene transcription via the serum response factor (SRF) and failed to induce neoplastic transformation. Thus, these results indicate that cytoskeletal changes are not sufficient to induce the transformed phenotype, and that Rho-effector molecules regulating the actin cytostructure are distinct from those signaling to the nucleus and subverting normal growth control."

In kinetic studies, cdk2 activation was inhibited efficiently only if p21Waf1 levels increased prior to the activating phosphorylation; suggesting that p21Waf1 had blocked this phosphorylation. This model was confirmed in cells from p21Waf1 knockout mice where PGA2 was completely unable to block the activating phosphorylation of cdk2, or inhibit cdk2 activity. As expected, growth inhibition of p21Waf1−/− cells was not observed at PGA2 concentrations which inhibited cdk2 activity and growth of p21Waf1+/+ cells."

Among 11 SCLC cell lines with L-myc gene amplification, four were found to have alteration of the RLF gene by Southern blot and RT-PCR analyses. One cell line, NCI-H378, contained aberrantly-sized L-myc-hybridizing bands by Southern and Northern blot hybridization but had no alteration of RLF. Some L-myc-hybridizing cDNAs from NCI-H378 contained a novel sequence with close homology to the cyclophilins joined to antisense L-myc exon 2 sequence. Full length cDNAs isolated from human skeletal muscle containing only the novel sequence identify open reading frames of 301 and 296 amino acids and differ in the C-terminal region by 22 and 17 amino acids. This gene, tentatively named PPIE (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase E), has 83% amino acid identity with the central conserved region of cyclophilin A, is evolutionarily conserved by Southern blot, and exhibits differential tissue expression with highest levels found in muscle and brain. Co-amplification of PPIE was observed in seven of eleven L-myc amplified cell lines. Analysis of radiation hybrids suggests that the gene order is RLF-PPIE-L-myc on chromosome 1p and pulse-field gel electrophoresis localizes all three genes to an 800 megabase Mlu I fragment. The prognostic and functional consequences of PPIE gene amplification in SCLC can now be determined."
