https://openalex.org/W1982918139,"Spatial navigation is often used as a behavioral task in studies of the neuronal circuits that underlie cognition, learning and memory in rodents. The combination of in vivo microscopy with genetically encoded indicators has provided an important new tool for studying neuronal circuits, but has been technically difficult to apply during navigation. Here we describe methods for imaging the activity of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus with subcellular resolution in behaving mice. Neurons that expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP3 were imaged through a chronic hippocampal window. Head-restrained mice performed spatial behaviors in a setup combining a virtual reality system and a custom-built two-photon microscope. We optically identified populations of place cells and determined the correlation between the location of their place fields in the virtual environment and their anatomical location in the local circuit. The combination of virtual reality and high-resolution functional imaging should allow a new generation of studies to investigate neuronal circuit dynamics during behavior."

The present study investigates the neural processes preceding the willingness to engage in costly helping toward ingroup and outgroup members. Soccer fans witnessed a fan of their favorite team (ingroup member) or of a rival team (outgroup member) experience pain. They were subsequently able to choose to help the other by enduring physical pain themselves to reduce the other's pain. Helping the ingroup member was best predicted by anterior insula activation when seeing him suffer and by associated self-reports of empathic concern. In contrast, not helping the outgroup member was best predicted by nucleus accumbens activation and the degree of negative evaluation of the other. We conclude that empathy-related insula activation can motivate costly helping, whereas an antagonistic signal in nucleus accumbens reduces the propensity to help.

Empathy-related brain responses in anterior insula predict costly helping Helping ingroup and outgroup members is predicted by distinct neural responses Brain responses predict behavior toward outgroup members better than self-reports For centuries, the question of whether human nature is fundamentally good or bad has been at the heart of controversial debates in philosophy, politics, and science. Behavioral social science research has investigated the conditions under which people behave in a prosocial manner (reviewed in Dovidio et al., 2006Dovidio J. Piliavin J. Schroeder D. Penner L. The Social Psychology of Prosocial Behavior. Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc., Mahwah, NJ2006Google Scholar, Penner et al., 2005Penner L.A. Dovidio J.F. Piliavin J.A. Schroeder D.A. Prosocial behavior: Multilevel perspectives.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2005; 56: 365-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying prosocial decisions and how they are modulated by social factors such as perceived group membership. One intriguing outcome of behavioral social science work is the claim that an altruistic motivation, directed toward the ultimate goal of increasing the welfare of a person in need, is evoked by empathy, also known as the empathy-altruism hypothesis (Batson, 1991Batson C.D. The Altruism Question: Toward a Social-Psychological Answer. Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ1991Google Scholar). Moreover, a number of studies have investigated whether and how prosocial behavior is affected by social factors such as group membership (Levine et al., 2005Levine M. Prosser A. Evans D. Reicher S. Identity and emergency intervention: How social group membership and inclusiveness of group boundaries shape helping behavior.Pers. Soc. Psychol. Bull. 2005; 31: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, Stürmer et al., 2005Stürmer S. Snyder M. Omoto A.M. Prosocial emotions and helping: The moderating role of group membership.J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 2005; 88: 532-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, Stürmer et al., 2006Stürmer S. Snyder M. Kropp A. Siem B. Empathy-motivated helping: The moderating role of group membership.Pers. Soc. Psychol. Bull. 2006; 32: 943-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The empirical evidence is mixed. Some studies have shown that people are more likely to help an ingroup member than an outgroup member in similar need (e.g., Levine et al., 2005Levine M. Prosser A. Evans D. Reicher S. Identity and emergency intervention: How social group membership and inclusiveness of group boundaries shape helping behavior.Pers. Soc. Psychol. Bull. 2005; 31: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), referred to as “parochial altruism” (De Dreu et al., 2010De Dreu C.K. Greer L.L. Handgraaf M.J. Shalvi S. Van Kleef G.A. Baas M. Ten Velden F.S. Van Dijk E. Feith S.W. The neuropeptide oxytocin regulates parochial altruism in intergroup conflict among humans.Science. 2010; 328: 1408-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). However, other studies did not find reliable differences in helping across groups (e.g., Stürmer et al., 2006Stürmer S. Snyder M. Kropp A. Siem B. Empathy-motivated helping: The moderating role of group membership.Pers. Soc. Psychol. Bull. 2006; 32: 943-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these inconsistent results is that the decision to help is not only influenced by group membership, but also by the potential helper's attitude toward the ingroup or outgroup member. A positive evaluation of the other has been found to increase expressed empathic concern, which should increase the likelihood of helping to relieve the empathy-inducing need (Batson et al., 2007Batson C.D. Eklund J.H. Chermok V.L. Hoyt J.L. Ortiz B.G. An additional antecedent of empathic concern: Valuing the welfare of the person in need.J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 2007; 93: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, Coke et al., 1978Coke J. Batson C.D. McDavis K. Empathic mediation of helping: A two-stage model.J. Pers. Soc.

Pers. Soc. Psychol. 1990; 59: 249-260Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Ingroup members tend to be evaluated more positively than outgroup members, which should lead to higher empathic concern for their suffering and increase the motivation to help. In contrast, the more negative evaluation of outgroup members should result in less empathic concern, decreasing helping motivation. Consistent with the findings of Lanzetta and Englis, 1989Lanzetta J.T. Englis B.G. Expectations of cooperation and competition and their effects on observers' vicarious emotional responses.J Pers. Soc. Psychol. 1989; 56: 543-554Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar, subjects may even take pleasure in the outgroup member's suffering. However, if an outgroup member is evaluated positively, “parochial altruism” should be undermined. Taken together, there is a large body of behavioral work focusing on the empathy-altruism hypothesis, and inconsistent findings regarding models of parochial altruism. However, the neural factors associated with prosocial decisions and their modulation by perceived group membership have not yet been investigated. Recent fMRI studies in social neuroscience have started to identify brain networks involved in empathy and their modulation (for reviews, see Decety and Lamm, 2006Decety J. Lamm C.

The comparison of brain activation elicited in participants experiencing pain and that elicited when they merely observe others experiencing pain showed shared activations in affective regions of the pain matrix, that is, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula (AI), which were related to self-reported measures of empathy (reviewed in Singer and Lamm, 2009Singer T. Lamm C. The social neuroscience of empathy.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2009; 1156: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar).

Empathic brain responses in insula are modulated by levels of alexithymia but not autism.Brain. 2009; 133: 1515-1525Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and experience with pain (Cheng et al., 2007Cheng Y. Lin C.P. Liu H.L. Hsu Y.Y. Lim K.E. Hung D. Decety J. Expertise modulates the perception of pain in others.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1708-1713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) have been found to modulate empathy-related brain responses in AI and ACC. Particularly relevant for the current study, Singer et al., 2006Singer T. Seymour B. O'Doherty J.P. Stephan K.E. Dolan R.J. Frith C.D. Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others.Nature. 2006; 439: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar found that male participants who perceived the suffering person as being unfair in a monetary exchange game showed nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation associated with their expressed desire for revenge instead of AI activation related to empathy, suggesting that two antagonistic motivational systems compete with each other. However, it is unknown whether this observed brain activation pattern can be extended to another domain such as perceived group membership of others and how these antagonistic brain signals relate to actual behavior, such as engagement in prosocial behavior. Here, we investigate whether brain responses elicited by witnessing another suffering pain are modulated by perceived group membership and how these brain responses are related to the prediction of costly helping—or a lack of helping—toward ingroup and outgroup members. More specifically, we hypothesized that individual differences in empathy-related brain activation in AI and ACC elicited when witnessing another suffering pain should predict differences in subsequent costly helping. Specifically, ingroup favoritism in helping should be linked to the difference in empathy-related brain responses when viewing an ingroup versus outgroup member in pain. Based on previous findings (Singer et al., 2006Singer T. Seymour B. O'Doherty J.P. Stephan K.E. Dolan R.J. Frith C.D. Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others.Nature. 2006; 439: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), we further predicted a reduction in empathy-related brain responses in the core empathy-related network and an increase in NAcc activation when participants see an outgroup instead of an ingroup member in pain. Furthermore, participants who see the outgroup member suffering pain and show activation in NAcc instead of empathy-related brain regions should show a decreased tendency to help the outgroup member later on. Finally, we aimed to compare the relative contributions of self-reports and brain measures to the prediction of helping the ingroup and outgroup members. To test these predictions, we used a natural group manipulation (fans of different soccer teams) and an fMRI paradigm to assess brain responses to others' suffering and costly helping. We recruited male fans of the local soccer team who were paired with a fellow fan of the same team (“ingroup confederate”). Both men received wristbands in the team color and with the emblem of the local team and met two fans of the local team's rival (“outgroup confederates”), wearing wristbands in the team color and with the emblem of the local team's rival. The two pairs played a competitive soccer quiz game against each other. The experimenter made sure that the ingroup pair always won to prompt uniform positive mood. Before entering the scanner, the participant and confederates completed the Sport Spectator Identification Scale (SSIS; Wann and Branscombe, 1993Wann D. Branscombe N. Sports fans: Measuring degree of identification with the team.Int. J. Sport Psychol. 1993; 24: 1-17Google Scholar), measuring their identification with their soccer team, and an Impression Scale (modified from Batson et al., 1988Batson C.D. Dyck J.L. Brandt J.R. Batson J.G. Powell A.L. McMaster M.R. Griffitt C. Five studies testing two new egoistic alternatives to the empathy-altruism hypothesis.J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 1988; 55: 52-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), on which they separately rated their impression of the ingroup member and the outgroup members (see Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Information available online for details). In Session 1 of the fMRI experiment, we measured participants' brain responses while they received highly, moderately, or mildly painful shocks through electrodes on the backs of their hands or while they observed the ingroup or an outgroup member, sitting on either side of the scanner, receive painful shocks (Singer et al., 2006Singer T. Seymour B. O'Doherty J.P. Stephan K.E. Dolan R.J. Frith C.D. Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others.Nature. 2006; 439: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The recipient of pain (self, ingroup, outgroup) and the intensity of the impending shock were indicated by visual cues (Figure 1A ). While being scanned, participants rated how they felt receiving high, medium, or low pain themselves, or observing it in the ingroup and outgroup member, on a rating scale (−4, very bad, to 4, very good). In an independent Session 2, the participant being scanned again observed the ingroup and outgroup member in pain. However, this time he was not receiving painful stimulation himself, but was to select one of three possible courses of action (Figure 1B). One option was to help the ingroup or outgroup member by volunteering to receive half of that person's pain himself, thus reducing the intensity of that person's pain stimulation by half (“Help” option). Such helping behavior was costly for the participant because it resulted in a painful shock. The second option was to not help, but to watch a soccer video instead, while the other suffered pain (“Watch Video” option). This option offered an attractive alternative to helping and distraction from watching the pain administration. The third option was to not help, but to watch the other person suffering pain (“Watch Pain” option). After scanning, the participants completed an Empathic Concern Scale, a measure of situational empathy (Batson et al., 1997Batson C.D. Early S. Salvarini G. Perspective taking: Imagining how another feels versus imagining how you would feel.Pers. Soc. Psychol. Bull. 1997; 23: 751-758Crossref Scopus (643) Google Scholar), separately assessing how they felt when observing the ingroup member and the outgroup member suffering pain (see Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Appendix for details). All participants filled in the name of the local soccer team as their favorite sports team and reported high scores of identification with their team, M = 6.3 (on a Likert scale, ranging from 1, low identification, to 8, high identification). We used the Wilcoxon signed rank test to test for differences in the average ratings for the ingroup member and the outgroup member. Confirming the success of the group manipulation, the average ratings for the ingroup member (M = 3.7, SE = 0.2) on the Impression Scale (Batson et al., 1988Batson C.D. Dyck J.L. Brandt J.R. Batson J.G. Powell A.L. McMaster M.R. Griffitt C. Five studies testing two new egoistic alternatives to the empathy-altruism hypothesis.J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 1988; 55: 52-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) were significantly more positive than for the outgroup member (M = 6.0, SE = 1.3, Likert scale from 1 [very much] to 9 [not at all], z = −3.4, p = 0.001 [Figure S1A available online]). We submitted the average ratings on the Empathic Concern Scale (Batson et al., 1997Batson C.D. Early S. Salvarini G. Perspective taking: Imagining how another feels versus imagining how you would feel.Pers. Soc. Psychol. Bull. 1997; 23: 751-758Crossref Scopus (643) Google Scholar) for the ingroup and the outgroup member to a Wilcoxon signed rank test. The results showed significantly more self-reported empathy for the ingroup member (M = 3.6, SE = 0.2) than for the outgroup member (M = 3, SE = 0.3) in pain (z = −2.2, p = 0.025). We only analyzed the data of 14 participants because 2 participants did not provide complete ratings. Confirming the results of the Empathic Concern Scale, the high pain of the outgroup member was rated significantly less negative than the high pain of the ingroup member (Wilcoxon signed rank tests, z = −2.7, p = 0.006). For self and the ingroup member, high pain stimulation was rated as significantly more aversive than medium pain stimulation, and medium pain stimulation significantly more aversive than low pain stimulation (self high-medium: z = −2.1, p = 0.002; medium-low: z = −3.5, p < 0.001; ingroup high-medium: z = −3.4, p = 0.001; medium-low: z = −3.3, p = 0.001). Pain ratings for the outgroup member showed a significant difference between medium and low (z = −2.3, p = 0.021), but not between high and medium pain (z < 1) (Figure S1B). The behavioral data of fMRI Session 2 were submitted to Wilcoxon signed rank tests. The results showed that participants indeed opted to endure pain themselves in order to help the other person, but more so for the ingroup (M = 65.7%, SE = 6.7) than for the outgroup member (M = 45.5%, SE = 7.1; z = −3.2, p = 0.001). There was no group effect regarding the Watch Video option (ingroup M = 26%, SE = 5.8; outgroup M = 30.6%, SE = 6.5; z = −1.4, p = 0.15). Participants watched the outgroup member (M = 23.6%, SE = 6.8) receive pain more frequently than they watched the ingroup member receive pain (M = 8%, SE = 3.7; z = −2.8, p = 0.005) (Figure 1C). However, the Watch Pain option was chosen only by 9 of our 16 participants, with an average of four trials. Therefore, this option was not subjected to further analyses. Our repeated trial design necessary for fMRI studies might have led to comparisons across trials regarding the frequency of ingroup and outgroup helping. As a consequence, participants might have felt some obligation to help, in particular to increase the frequency of outgroup helping. A potential feeling of obligation should have built up with an increasing number of comparisons across trials, reflected in differences between people's helping behavior at the beginning and at the end of the session. To test this assumption, we calculated the frequency with which the participant helped the outgroup member in the first half of Session 2 (i.e., the first nine trials per participant) and in the second half of Session 2 (i.e., the last nine trials per participant). We then calculated the frequency of helping across all 16 participants in the two session halves and used the Mann-Whitney test to compare them. The results showed no differences between people's helping behavior in the first and second half of Session 2, rendering the possibility unlikely that the helping was primarily based on a feeling of obligation (frequency of outgroup helping first half = 67 [out of 144 trials]; second half = 65 [out of 144 trials], Mann-Whitney U-test, U = 10268, p = 0.88; frequency of ingroup helping first half = 106 [out of 144 trials], second half = 84 [out of 144 trials], U = 10225, p = 0.81). The lack of sequence effects was further confirmed by additional analyses contrasting (1) the first and last quartiles of Session 2 (five trials each; U = 3195, p = 0.98), and (2) the first two and the last two trials of Session 2 (U = 436, p = 0.82). To analyze the link between neural responses when observing the other's suffering in Session 1, and helping behavior in Session 2, we used a region of interest (ROI) approach, following the guideline for independent ROI analyses (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009Kriegeskorte N. Simmons W.K. Bellgowan P.S. Baker C.I. Circular analysis in systems neuroscience: The dangers of double dipping.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). A meta-analysis of three independent fMRI studies using a similar paradigm as in Session 1 with male participants (Bird et al., 2009Bird G. Silani G. White S. Frith U. Singer T. Empathic brain responses in insula are modulated by levels of alexithymia but not autism.Brain. 2009; 133: 1515-1525Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar, Singer et al., 2006Singer T. Seymour B. O'Doherty J.P. Stephan K.E. Dolan R.J. Frith C.D. Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others.Nature. 2006; 439: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, Singer et al., 2008Singer T. Snozzi R. Bird G. Petrovic P. Silani G. Heinrichs M. Dolan R.J. Effects of oxytocin and prosocial behavior on brain responses to direct and vicariously experienced pain.Emotion. 2008; 8: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) provided nine ROIs including bilateral insula and ACC (see Table S5 for a list of all nine ROIs with center coordinates). For each participant we extracted the beta values averaged over all voxels of each of the nine ROIs. In addition, we conducted whole-brain multiple regression analyses, corrected for multiple comparisons across all nine ROIs (Figure S2). Finally, we also performed whole-brain analyses (Experimental Procedures, Tables S1–S4). First, we tested the link between brain responses when observing suffering of ingroup or outgroup members in Session 1 and helping in Session 2 collapsed across groups. Individual activation in the left AI when seeing others' suffering in Session 1 (i.e., the contrast between high versus low pain trials, pooled across the ingroup and outgroup conditions) predicted the total number of trials in which people chose to help [r(16) = 0.57, p = 0.019], and correlated negatively with the number of trials in which participants opted to watch the video instead of helping [r(16) = −0.59, p = 0.015]. These results confirm our hypothesis that the magnitude of responses in left AI when witnessing another person suffering pain predicts participants' tendency to engage in costly helping later on. Moreover, individual differences in left AI activation correlated significantly with individual differences in empathic concern expressed on the Empathic Concern Scale (Batson et al., 1997Batson C.D. Early S. Salvarini G. Perspective taking: Imagining how another feels versus imagining how you would feel.Pers. Soc. Psychol. Bull. 1997; 23: 751-758Crossref Scopus (643) Google Scholar) (r(16) = 0.52, p = 0.042), indicating that brain responses observed in AI during the empathy condition are indeed linked to self-reported feelings of empathic concern. No significant correlations were observed in the other ROIs (Table S5). Complementary whole-brain regression analysis confirmed that left AI was the only brain region showing significant correlation with helping behavior and self-reported empathic concern (Figure S2). Conjunction analyses between self pain and other pain further replicate previous findings of shared activation in left AI elicited both when processing nociceptive stimuli in self and when empathizing with the pain of others (Tables S2 and S4; for the contrast between high versus low self-pain and the brain region parametrically modulated by high, medium, and low pain stimulation; see Table S1). Next, we tested for differences in brain responses when participants observed the ingroup versus outgroup member in pain, and assessed the relationship of these differences to ingroup favoritism in helping behavior. The group-averaged activation in left AI was stronger when participants saw high versus low pain in the ingroup member (high – low ingroup pain) as compared with high versus low pain in the outgroup member [high – low outgroup pain; t(15) = 2.9, p = 0.009; Figure 2A ], reflecting an ingroup bias in empathy-related AI brain responses. Interestingly, the individual ingroup − outgroup difference in left AI responses (high – low ingroup pain versus high – low outgroup pain contrast) predicted the extent of participants' ingroup favoritism in subsequent costly helping (r(16) = 0.53, p = 0.037; Figure 2B). The stronger participants' AI responses to ingroup pain relative to outgroup pain in Session 1, the more they helped the ingroup member, but not the outgroup member, in Session 2. Equivalent analyses in the other ROIs revealed no significant results (Table S5). Complementary whole-brain analyses confirmed the significant difference between ingroup and outgroup pain in left AI, but not in other ROIs (Table S3).

Epithelial polarization is regulated by polarity complexes that are hypothesized to direct downstream events, such as polarized membrane traffic, although this interconnection is not well understood. We have found that Rab11a regulates apical traffic and lumen formation through the Rab guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Rabin8, and its target, Rab8a. Rab8a and Rab11a function through the exocyst to target Par3 to the apical surface, and control apical Cdc42 activation through the Cdc42 GEF, Tuba. These components assemble at a transient apical membrane initiation site to form the lumen. This Rab11a-directed network directs Cdc42-dependent apical exocytosis during lumen formation, revealing an interaction between the machineries of vesicular transport and polarization."

Here, we show that microglial neuroinflammation promotes MAPT phosphorylation and aggregation. First, lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial activation promotes hyperphosphorylation of endogenous mouse MAPT in nontransgenic mice that is further enhanced in mice lacking the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) and is dependent upon functional toll-like receptor 4 and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors. Second, humanized MAPT transgenic mice lacking CX3CR1 exhibited enhanced MAPT phosphorylation and aggregation as well as behavioral impairments that correlated with increased levels of active p38 MAPK. Third, in vitro experiments demonstrate that microglial activation elevates the level of active p38 MAPK and enhances MAPT hyperphosphorylation within neurons that can be blocked by administration of an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our results suggest that CX3CR1 and IL-1/p38 MAPK may serve as novel therapeutic targets for human tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2154649497,"A continuum of acoustically varying speech sounds is not perceived as a continuum, but as distinct phonetic categories. Chang et al. recorded directly from human posterior superior temporal gyrus and found that this area has a similarly discontinuous coding of objectively continuous sound, matching perception and indicating higher-level processing. Speech perception requires the rapid and effortless extraction of meaningful phonetic information from a highly variable acoustic signal. A powerful example of this phenomenon is categorical speech perception, in which a continuum of acoustically varying sounds is transformed into perceptually distinct phoneme categories. We found that the neural representation of speech sounds is categorically organized in the human posterior superior temporal gyrus. Using intracranial high-density cortical surface arrays, we found that listening to synthesized speech stimuli varying in small and acoustically equal steps evoked distinct and invariant cortical population response patterns that were organized by their sensitivities to critical acoustic features. Phonetic category boundaries were similar between neurometric and psychometric functions. Although speech-sound responses were distributed, spatially discrete cortical loci were found to underlie specific phonetic discrimination. Our results provide direct evidence for acoustic-to–higher order phonetic level encoding of speech sounds in human language receptive cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1997241837,"The inhibitory receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1) is upregulated on exhausted CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals. Quigley et al. analyzed the transcriptional profile induced by PD-1 ligation and report that a transcription factor, BATF, is upregulated by PD-1 signaling and has a key role in PD-1–mediated inhibition of T cell function. CD8+ T cells in chronic viral infections such as HIV develop functional defects including loss of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion and decreased proliferative potential that are collectively termed 'exhaustion'1. Exhausted T cells express increased amounts of multiple inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1)2,3, that contribute to impaired virus-specific T cell function. Although reversing PD-1 inhibition is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy, the cellular mechanisms by which PD-1 ligation results in T cell inhibition are not fully understood. PD-1 is thought to limit T cell activation by attenuating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling4,5. It is not known whether PD-1 also acts by upregulating genes in exhausted T cells that impair their function. Here we analyzed gene expression profiles from HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in individuals with HIV and show that PD-1 coordinately upregulates a program of genes in exhausted CD8+ T cells from humans and mice. This program includes upregulation of basic leucine transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF), a transcription factor in the AP-1 family. Enforced expression of BATF was sufficient to impair T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD-1 inhibition. Silencing BATF in T cells from individuals with chronic viremia rescued HIV-specific T cell function. Thus, inhibitory receptors can cause T cell exhaustion by upregulating genes—such as BATF—that inhibit T cell function. Such genes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve T cell immunity to HIV."

https://openalex.org/W2034373020,"A Xenopus laevis two-reporter screen identifies the antihelminthic drug pyrvinium as an inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway that works by activating CK1α, which is likely working at the level of Pygopus, a core transcriptional component of the Wnt pathway. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is critically involved in metazoan development, stem cell maintenance and human disease. Using Xenopus laevis egg extract to screen for compounds that both stabilize Axin and promote β-catenin turnover, we identified an FDA-approved drug, pyrvinium, as a potent inhibitor of Wnt signaling (EC50 of ∼10 nM). We show pyrvinium binds all casein kinase 1 (CK1) family members in vitro at low nanomolar concentrations and pyrvinium selectively potentiates casein kinase 1α (CK1α) kinase activity. CK1α knockdown abrogates the effects of pyrvinium on the Wnt pathway. In addition to its effects on Axin and β-catenin levels, pyrvinium promotes degradation of Pygopus, a Wnt transcriptional component. Pyrvinium treatment of colon cancer cells with mutation of the gene for adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or β-catenin inhibits both Wnt signaling and proliferation. Our findings reveal allosteric activation of CK1α as an effective mechanism to inhibit Wnt signaling and highlight a new strategy for targeted therapeutics directed against the Wnt pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2146535241,"Endocannabinoids and their receptor CB1 play key roles in brain function. Astrocytes express CB1Rs that are activated by endocannabinoids released by neurons. However, the consequences of the endocannabinoid-mediated neuron-astrocyte signaling on synaptic transmission are unknown. We show that endocannabinoids released by hippocampal pyramidal neurons increase the probability of transmitter release at CA3-CA1 synapses. This synaptic potentiation is due to CB1R-induced Ca(2+) elevations in astrocytes, which stimulate the release of glutamate that activates presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors. While endocannabinoids induce synaptic depression in the stimulated neuron by direct activation of presynaptic CB1Rs, they indirectly lead to synaptic potentiation in relatively more distant neurons by activation of CB1Rs in astrocytes. Hence, astrocyte calcium signal evoked by endogenous stimuli (neuron-released endocannabinoids) modulates synaptic transmission. Therefore, astrocytes respond to endocannabinoids that then potentiate synaptic transmission, indicating that astrocytes are actively involved in brain physiology."

One of the most unusual but unexplained features of VGLUT function is its Cl− dependence. ATP-dependent glutamate uptake in synaptic vesicles exhibits a biphasic dependence on Cl− (Naito and Ueda, 1985Naito S. Ueda T. Characterization of glutamate uptake into synaptic vesicles.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22314-22320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the absence of Cl−, glutamate uptake into synaptic vesicles is very low, but low [Cl−] (4 mM) strongly activates transport, with inhibition at higher concentrations. Cl− dependence is even more extreme in proteoliposomes containing purified VGLUT2 and bacterial F-ATPase; no transport activity is observed in the absence of Cl− but full activity appears ∼4 mM Cl− (Juge et al., 2006Juge N.

Chem. 2006; 281: 39499-39506Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the Cl− dependence on the glutamate uptake reflects an allosteric effect, and that the decrease at high [Cl−] reflects dissipation of Δψ (Hartinger and Jahn, 1993Hartinger J.

Vesicular glutamate transporter contains two independent transport machineries.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39499-39506Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, previous work using heterologous expression has suggested that VGLUT1 exhibits a Cl− conductance (Bellocchio et al., 2000Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Edwards R.H. Uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles by an inorganic phosphate transporter.Science. 2000; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), and more recently, functional reconstitution of purified VGLUT1 and bacterial F-ATPase has supported this possibility, although Cl− flux itself was not actually demonstrated (Schenck et al., 2009Schenck S. Wojcik S.M. Brose N. Takamori S. A chloride conductance in VGLUT1 underlies maximal glutamate loading into synaptic vesicles.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These studies nonetheless indicate that Cl− dependence is an intrinsic property of VGLUTs, although the mechanism responsible and its physiological role in the regulation of quantal size remain poorly understood. We have investigated the molecular mechanism for regulation of the VGLUTs by Cl−. In the course of these studies, we have found a surprising but strong link between the Cl− dependence of VGLUTs and the metabolic control of seizures by ketone bodies. We show that Cl− acts as an allosteric activator for VGLUTs, that ketone bodies and acetoacetate in particular compete with Cl− for VGLUT activation, and that this regulatory mechanism is conserved in the entire SLC17 transporter family. Finally, we show that acetoacetate reversibly inhibits glutamate release in vivo. In both native membranes and proteoliposomes containing an active proton pump as well as VGLUT, Cl− has a dual role in regulation of the transporter, and in expression of the Δψ that drives transport (Juge et al., 2006Juge N. Yoshida Y. Yatsushiro S. Omote H. Moriyama Y. Vesicular glutamate transporter contains two independent transport machineries.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39499-39506Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Schenck et al., 2009Schenck S. Wojcik S.M. Brose N. Takamori S. A chloride conductance in VGLUT1 underlies maximal glutamate loading into synaptic vesicles.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To characterize the effect of Cl− on the transporter independent of the driving force, we have therefore established an in vitro assay with proteoliposomes containing only the purified VGLUTs, where Cl− can be manipulated without affecting Δψ. As a first step to characterizing the interaction of VGLUTs with Cl−, purified VGLUT2 was reconstituted into liposomes in the presence of Na-acetate (Figure 1A ). The resultant proteoliposomes were suspended in buffer containing K-acetate. Upon addition of valinomycin (Val), a stable, inside positive Δψ of 87.2 ± 0.07 mV, n = 3, was established through the electrogenic entry of K+ into proteoliposomes and thus triggered glutamate uptake (Figure 1B). The characteristics of Val-evoked glutamate uptake, including the kinetic parameters, sensitivity to Evans blue and diisothiocyanostilbene disulfonic acid (DIDS), and insensitivity to aspartate, were essentially identical to those reported previously (Figure 1B and see Figure S1 available online; Juge et al., 2006Juge N. Yoshida Y. Yatsushiro S. Omote H. Moriyama Y. Vesicular glutamate transporter contains two independent transport machineries.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39499-39506Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Bioenergetic analysis under defined Δψ and/or ΔpH conditions indicated that Δψ but not ΔpH primarily triggered glutamate uptake (Figure 1C). As observed in proteoliposomes containing VGLUT2 and F-ATPase (Juge et al., 2006Juge N. Yoshida Y. Yatsushiro S. Omote H. Moriyama Y. Vesicular glutamate transporter contains two independent transport machineries.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39499-39506Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Schenck et al., 2009Schenck S.

Neurosci. 2009; 12: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), Δψ-mediated glutamate uptake absolutely required Cl−: glutamate transport was not detected in the absence of Cl−. Glutamate uptake appeared at 2 mM Cl−, increased drastically with a slight increase of [Cl−], and reached a plateau at 5 mM (Figure 1D). The steady glutamate uptake and magnitude of Δψ at Cl− concentrations above 5 mM contrasted with the results of proteoliposomes containing VGLUT and F-ATPase (Juge et al., 2006Juge N. Yoshida Y. Yatsushiro S. Omote H. Moriyama Y. Vesicular glutamate transporter contains two independent transport machineries.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39499-39506Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Schenck et al., 2009Schenck S. Wojcik S.M. Brose N. Takamori S. A chloride conductance in VGLUT1 underlies maximal glutamate loading into synaptic vesicles.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that Cl−-dependent activation of VGLUT2 exhibited a strong and extraordinarily positive cooperativity for glutamate transport with a Hill coefficient for Cl− of ∼3 (Figure 1D). We further found that, in contrast to proteoliposomes containing VGLUT1 and F-ATPase (Schenck et al., 2009Schenck S. Wojcik S.M. Brose N. Takamori S. A chloride conductance in VGLUT1 underlies maximal glutamate loading into synaptic vesicles.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), intravesicular Cl− did not affect Cl− and Δψ-dependent glutamate uptake (Figure 1E). Br− compensated for Cl−, while sulfate showed a slight stimulatory effect and neither iodide nor fluoride showed much stimulation (Figure 1F). An important question was whether Cl− was actually transported through VGLUT2 during Cl− and Δψ-dependent glutamate uptake. We investigated this issue using two independent procedures: direct isotope tracing and a fluorometric procedure employing 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)-quinolinum monohydrate (SPQ), a fluorescent Cl− indicator (Biwersi et al., 1994Biwersi J. Tulk B. Verkman A.S. Long-wavelength chloride-sensitive fluorescent indicators.Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The background level of 36Cl− uptake was shown in liposomes in the presence or absence of Δψ by radioisotope tracing (Figure 2A , left). 36Cl− uptake at equilibrium was determined by the addition of nystatin, an anion ionophore (Russell et al., 1977Russell J.M. Eaton D.C. Brodwick M.S. Effects of nystatin on membrane conductance and internal ion activities in Aplysia neurons.J. Membr. Biol. 1977; 37: 137-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), to demonstrate the impermeability of the liposomal membrane to Cl− (Figure 2A). Δψ alone did not facilitate 36Cl− uptake by VGLUT2-containing proteoliposomes. The inward flux of Cl− during glutamate uptake was significantly lower than the influx at equilibrium in the presence of nystatin (Figure 2A). Vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) is a Δψ-driven Cl−/GABA cotransporter and was used as a positive control for vesicular Cl− uptake (Juge et al., 2009Juge N. Muroyama A. Hiasa M. Omote H. Moriyama Y. Vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter is a Cl−/γ-aminobutyrate co-transporter.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35073-35078Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2A, VGAT facilitates active transport of GABA-dependent Cl− uptake against a Cl− concentration gradient. Entry of Cl− into proteoliposomes loaded with SPQ should result in decreased fluorescence intensity due to collisions between SPQ and Cl− (Accardi and Miller, 2004Accardi A. Miller C. Secondary active transport mediated by a prokaryotic homologue of ClC Cl− channels.Nature. 2004; 427: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Therefore, we prepared SPQ-trapped proteoliposomes and monitored changes of SPQ fluorescent intensity. SPQ fluorescence quenching was not observed in the absence or presence of external Cl− (10 mM) in VGLUT2-containing proteoliposomes (Figure 2B). On the other hand, in VGAT-containing proteoliposomes, the addition of GABA and Val quenched SPQ fluorescence (Figure 2B). Glycine, another substrate for VGAT (Juge et al., 2009Juge N. Muroyama A. Hiasa M. Omote H. Moriyama Y. Vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter is a Cl−/γ-aminobutyrate co-transporter.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35073-35078Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), caused similar fluorescence quenching, while glutamate, which is not a substrate for VGAT, did not (Figure 2B). The addition of Val and GABA to liposomes containing the inactive mutant of VGAT, E213A (Juge et al., 2009Juge N. Muroyama A. Hiasa M. Omote H. Moriyama Y. Vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter is a Cl−/γ-aminobutyrate co-transporter.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35073-35078Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), did not quench SPQ fluorescence (Figure 2B). The quenching induced by Cl−, GABA, and Val in VGAT-containing liposomes exhibited dose dependence with apparent Km values for GABA and Cl− of 0.79 and 2.7 mM, respectively, while no such dependence was observed in VGLUT2-containing proteoliposomes (Figure S2). The results suggest that Cl− acts in an allosteric manner to regulate VGLUT activity. If this were the case, other substances might also bind at the same site and affect VGLUT2 Cl−-dependence. We thus screened for such substances and included 10 mM Cl− in the standard assay because this concentration both approximates physiological conditions and confers maximal activity (Figure 1D). Among more than 30 metabolic intermediates tested, we found that ketone bodies (acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate) inhibited glutamate transport (Figures 3A and S3). In addition, pyruvate, an intermediate in the glycolytic pathway also inhibited glutamate transport (Figures 3A, S3, and S4). Of the compounds tested, acetoacetate had the strongest inhibitory effect, exhibiting a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.2 mM (Figure 3A). The presence of 10 mM acetoacetate did not affect the formation of Δψ by the proteoliposomes, confirming that a constant force was established during the assay (Figure 3B). As expected, acetoacetate changed the Cl− dependence of VGLUT2, shifting it to higher concentrations (Figure 3C) and suggesting a competitive interaction. In 10 mM Cl−, 1 mM acetoacetate inhibited glutamate uptake without affecting the cooperativity for Cl− (Figure 3D). The effect of 1 mM acetoacetate was overcome by 100 mM Cl− (Figure 3C). In contrast, acetoacetate did not compete with glutamate (Figure 3E). The effect of acetoacetate was totally reversible and full activity was recovered by washing the compound out of the preparation (Figure 3F). Furthermore, we found that the effects of Cl− and acetoacetate were observed when these compounds were present outside vesicles: neither was effective from the luminal side of the proteoliposomes (Figure 3G). DIDS (1 μM) is a potent inhibitor for VGLUT but its inhibition was effectively blocked by 100 mM Cl− (Figure 3G; Hartinger and Jahn, 1993Hartinger J. Jahn R.

Similarly, the presence of 5 mM acetoacetate prevented DIDS-evoked inactivation of VGLUT2 (Figure 3G). Essentially the same effects of Cl− and acetoacetate were observed in the ATP-dependent glutamate uptake by synaptic vesicles (Figure S5). So far, six types of vesicular neurotransmitter transporters have been identified: the VGLUTs, VNUT (vesicular nucleotide transporter, SLC17A9), VEAT (vesicular excitatory amino acid transporter, SLC17A5), VGAT (SLC32A1), VMAT1–2 (vesicular monoamine transporter 1 and 2, SLC18A1–2), and VAChT (vesicular acetylcholine transporter, SLC18A3) (Schuldiner, 1994Schuldiner S.

https://openalex.org/W2007991122,"Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a disorder of neurodevelopment resulting in a small brain. We identified WDR62 as the second most common cause of MCPH after finding homozygous missense and frame-shifting mutations in seven MCPH families. In human cell lines, we found that WDR62 is a spindle pole protein, as are ASPM and STIL, the MCPH7 and MCHP7 proteins. Mutant WDR62 proteins failed to localize to the mitotic spindle pole. In human and mouse embryonic brain, we found that WDR62 expression was restricted to neural precursors undergoing mitosis. These data lend support to the hypothesis that the exquisite control of the cleavage furrow orientation in mammalian neural precursor cell mitosis, controlled in great part by the centrosomes and spindle poles, is critical both in causing MCPH when perturbed and, when modulated, generating the evolutionarily enlarged human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2094074562,"Christopher Walsh and colleagues used targeted high-throughput sequencing to identify mutations in WDR62 in human microcephaly. The authors report that WDR62 is a centrosomal protein. Genes associated with human microcephaly, a condition characterized by a small brain, include critical regulators of proliferation, cell fate and DNA repair. We describe a syndrome of congenital microcephaly and diverse defects in cerebral cortical architecture. Genome-wide linkage analysis in two families identified a 7.5-Mb locus on chromosome 19q13.12 containing 148 genes. Targeted high throughput sequence analysis of linked genes in each family yielded > 4,000 DNA variants and implicated a single gene, WDR62, as harboring potentially deleterious changes. We subsequently identified additional WDR62 mutations in four other families. Magnetic resonance imaging and postmortem brain analysis supports important roles for WDR62 in the proliferation and migration of neuronal precursors. WDR62 is a WD40 repeat–containing protein expressed in neuronal precursors as well as in postmitotic neurons in the developing brain and localizes to the spindle poles of dividing cells. The diverse phenotypes of WDR62 suggest it has central roles in many aspects of cerebral cortical development."

Since the “visual” cortex of early-blind subjects is widely activated during a variety of perceptual and cognitive tasks, the only way to identify functional specialization is to compare patterns of activation elicited by different conditions in the same subjects in a well-controlled paradigm. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in early-blind individuals and sighted controls to compare brain activation patterns elicited by the processing of spatial and nonspatial attributes of equivalent auditory and vibrotactile stimuli. In addition, we ran a control experiment in a separate group of sighted subjects to identify the regions within the OC that are specialized for spatial processing in vision. The main experiment was done in two groups of 12 early-blind (EB) volunteers and 12 sighted controls (SCs). Both auditory and vibrotactile stimuli varied in two dimensions: frequency and spatial location. The subjects were instructed to either detect the stimuli (Detection condition) or perform a one-back comparison task where they had to determine whether each stimulus was the same or different from the preceding one regarding either its frequency (Identification condition) or its location (Localization condition). Blind participants were totally blind from birth or by the second year of life (see Table 1). In a control experiment, a separate group of six sighted subjects performed one-back spatial and nonspatial visual tasks comparing either locations (Localization condition) or geometric shapes (Identification condition) of figures presented on a projection screen.Table 1Characteristics of Early-Blind SubjectsSubjectSexAgeHandednessCause and onset of blindnessOnset of blindnessEB01M45RightRetinopathy∗No additional detail available.

Open table in a new tab We performed separate analyses of performance accuracy in detection (Figure 1A ) and identification/localization (Figures 1B and 1C) because of differences in cognitive demand between these tasks (simple detection versus one-back comparison). Detection scores did not differ between the EB and SC groups but were generally higher for the auditory than the tactile condition (F1,22 = 18.76; p < 0.001). A three-way ANOVA performed on accuracy in the identification and localization tasks showed no effect of group (F1,22 = 0.037; p = 0.085) but an effect of the task (F1,22 = 30.135; p < 0.001) and modality (F1,22 = 41.967; p < 0.001); tactile identification was more difficult than auditory identification and tactile localization in the two groups (all p values < 0.05). The interaction between task and modality was also significant (F1,22 = 46.302; p < 0.001). Performance accuracy differed between the two tasks in the tactile but not in the auditory modality. Performance accuracy during the visual conditions in the control study with SC participants was also satisfactory (>95% of accuracy). No difference was observed between the identification and localization conditions in vision (p > 0.05). In both groups, the contrast of Auditory conditions versus Rest showed the expected bilateral activation in the primary and secondary auditory cortices within the superior temporal gyri (Brodmann areas [BAs] 41, 42, 22), whereas the contrast of Tactile conditions versus Rest showed bilateral activation (more pronounced in the left hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated hand) in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices within the postcentral gyri (BA1, 2, 3, 40, 43; Tables S1 and S2 available online and Figure 2). In the OC, the middle and inferior occipital gyri (MOG and IOG, BA19) were bilaterally activated in EB subjects and deactivated in SC subjects during both auditory and tactile conditions (Tables S3 and S4 and Figure 2). Among OC areas, only the lingual-gyrus/cuneus (LG, BA17/18) was activated during the auditory and tactile conditions in both groups, though to a larger extent in EB subjects. A between-group comparison for each modality showed that the frontal and occipital cortices, including parts of the cuneus, the LG (BA18), and the MOG and IOG, were overall more activated in EB than in SC subjects during both the auditory and the tactile conditions (q[FDR] < 0.05, Figure 3). The contrasts between the auditory and tactile modality in each group did not show any modality-specific activation in the OC in either EB or SC subjects even at a low threshold of p < 0.005 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons in combination with a cluster size threshold of p < 0.05). Even at the individual level, no clear modality specificity was observed in the OC of EB subjects. While some subjects activated their OC more during the auditory than the tactile conditions, other subjects showed the opposite pattern. We did not find a double dissociation within the OC of any blind subject. Functional brain activity in 12 early-blind subjects (EB) and 12 sighted control subjects (SC) during auditory and tactile processing was projected onto a 3D representation of the right and left hemispheres (RH and LH) of a representative brain of one subject. The activation maps resulting from the contrasts between the auditory and tactile conditions compared to the baseline were obtained by RFX with a threshold of q < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR in combination with a cluster size threshold of p < 0.05.

(C) Brain activation related to tactile processing in EB (in yellow) and in SC subjects (in blue). (D) Brain deactivation, i.e., negative BOLD response, related to tactile processing in EB (in pale yellow) and in SC subjects (in pale blue). The middle and inferior occipital gyri were bilaterally activated in EB subjects and deactivated in SC subjects during the auditory and tactile conditions. The lingual gyrus-cuneus (LingG, BA17-18) was bilaterally activated in EB and SC subjects during the auditory and tactile conditions, though to a much larger extent in EB subjects and during the auditory conditions. See also Tables S1–S5.

The color-gradient scale codes the t values. LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere. See also Table S8 and Figure 5. Conjunction analyses using a threshold of p < 0.001 (uncorrected) confirmed that the left and right MOG-IOG (BA19) and the LG/cuneus (BA17/18) were similarly activated by both modalities in EB subjects (Table S5). In SC subjects, the same conjunction analysis showed that the left (x: −40, y: −70, z: 1, 38 voxels) and right (x: 46, y: −67, z: −1, 131 voxels) MOG were deactivated by both modalities. Other brain regions, including the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG, BA6), the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the precuneus, were activated conjointly by both modalities in each group. However, in SC subjects the activation in the parietal cortex was confined to the left hemisphere, while in EB subjects it was bilateral. The contrast of Identification minus Detection showed a similar activation pattern in the frontal cortex including the right middle frontal cortex and the insula bilaterally in both groups, but occipital activation in EB subjects only (p < 0.001 uncorrected, Table S6). The contrast of Localization minus Detection showed a similar brain activation pattern in the parietal cortex including the right IPL in both groups (p < 0.001 uncorrected, Table S7), but occipital activation in EB subjects only. The reversed contrasts, i.e., Detection minus Localization and Detection minus Identification, did not show any activation in the OC in either of the two groups. The between-group comparison for each task (Identification and Localization) confirmed that the OC, including the MOG bilaterally and the lingual gyrus (LG), was significantly more activated in EB than in SC subjects (q < 0.05, FDR corrected, Table S8). The contrast of Localization minus Identification showed that in addition to medial parietal areas (such as the precuneus and the superior parietal lobule [SPL]), part of the right MOG (BA19; x: 51, y: −64, z: −5; 101 voxels) was specifically more activated during localization than identification conditions in EB subjects (Table S9 and Figure 4). When we used a more liberal threshold of p < 0.005 (uncorrected), a similar MOG focus appeared in the left hemisphere as well. With this more liberal threshold, the right MOG focus was also found in the contrast of Localization minus Identification in the auditory modality alone (where the behavioral performance was well balanced). The between-group comparison for the same contrast revealed bilateral activations in MOG (Figure 5). The activity profile observed in the right MOG focus was very similar to the one observed in the parietal regions (Figure 4). The same contrast in SC generated similar activation in the parietal cortex, particularly in the right hemisphere, but no activation in the OC (Table S9). The contrast of Identification minus Localization did not show any activation in the OC for either of the groups (even at a more relaxed threshold of p < 0.005 uncorrected). Results from the control experiment in sighted subjects confirmed that a large portion of the MOG, which included the MOG focus observed in EB subjects, was more activated during the spatial than the nonspatial task in vision (Figure 6). Task-related brain activation in 12 early-blind subjects (EB). Activation maps were projected onto a 3D representation of the right and left hemispheres (RH and LH) of the brain of a representative subject. The statistical maps were obtained using RFX with an uncorrected threshold of p < 0.001. The top of the figure shows the brain activation related to identification (in blue) and localization (in yellow), as obtained from the contrasts of Identification minus Localization and of Localization minus Identification. The right middle occipital gyrus (MOG, BA19) and several subregions of the parietal cortex were more activated during localization than identification conditions. The main parietal activation foci were located in the precuneus in both hemispheres (see Table S9). No activation focus in the occipital cortex of EB subjects was found to be more activated during identification than localization conditions. The color-gradient scale codes the t values. The group comparison for the contrast of Localization minus Identification (interaction) confirms that the right (and the left) MOG was more activated in EB than in SC subjects and during spatial than nonspatial processing (see Figure 5). The bottom of Figure 4 shows the activity profiles (i.e., the percentages of signal change as a function of task and modality) in the left and right precuneus and the right MOG in EB (first row) and SC subjects (second row). In EB subjects, the activity profiles for the right MOG and the precuneus were very similar; localization conditions in both modalities activated these regions more strongly than identification or detection conditions. In sighted subjects, the activity profile was similar to that in EB subjects in the precuneus but not in the right MOG, which was mainly deactivated in both modalities. In the precuneus, the signal change appears weaker in SC than in EB subjects, but the precuneus areas with the biggest differences between identification and localization in SC do not exactly correspond to the ones in EB subjects (see Table S9). ∗p < 0.01; ∗∗p < 0.005; ∗∗∗p < 0.001.

Because MEC projects preferentially to the proximal part of the CA1, bordering CA2, whereas LEC innervates only the distal part, bordering subiculum, we asked if spatial tuning is graded along the transverse axis of CA1. Tetrodes were implanted along the entire proximodistal axis of dorsal CA1 in rats. Data were recorded in cylinders large enough to elicit firing at more than one location in many neurons. Distal CA1 cells showed more dispersed firing and had a larger number of firing fields than proximal cells. Phase-locking of spikes to MEC theta oscillations was weaker in distal CA1 than in proximal CA1. The findings suggest that spatial firing in CA1 is organized transversally, with the strongest spatial modulation occurring in the MEC-associated proximal part."

The phenotypes are rescued by expressing the snapin transgene, but not the DIC-binding-defective Snapin-L99K mutant.

Deleting snapin results in accumulated late endosomes/immature lysosomes in neurons Deleting snapin impairs lysosomal degradation and reduces autolysosomal clearance Snapin binding to dynein DIC is crucial for retrograde transport of late endosomes Snapin-enhanced transport facilitates late endosome-lysosomal fusion in neurons Maintenance of neuronal morphology and function depends on efficient intracellular transport because the main synthetic and degradative compartments are located in the soma. Anterograde transport delivers newly synthesized organelles and macromolecules from the soma to distal processes and synapses while retrograde transport returns organelles in the endocytic and autophagic pathway to the soma (Goldstein and Yang, 2000Goldstein L.S.

Neurosci. 2005; 6: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Late endocytic trafficking delivers target materials and internalized proteins to lysosomes for degradation (Luzio et al., 2007Luzio J.P. Pryor P.R. Bright N.A. Lysosomes: Fusion and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). The newly synthesized precursors of lysosomal hydrolases are transported from the trans-Golgi-network (TGN) through endosomes to acidic lysosomes for maturation (Ishidoh and Kominami, 2002Ishidoh K. Kominami E. Processing and activation of lysosomal proteinases.Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, these two processes rely on the same trafficking pathway, which is crucial for the maturation and degradative capacity of the autophagy-lysosomal system. However, the cellular mechanisms regulating the late endocytic trafficking pathway and its impact on lysosomal maturation and proteolysis in neurons are not fully understood. Because lysosomes are predominantly localized in the soma and proximal region of neurons, dynein-dependent retrograde transport is critical for delivering late endosomal cargo from the cell periphery and distal processes to the soma, bringing late endosomes and lysosomes into sufficient proximity to fuse with high efficiency. Perturbation of dynein-dynactin function results in the dispersion of late endocytic organelles to the cell periphery (Harada et al., 1998Harada A. Takei Y. Kanai Y. Tanaka Y. Nonaka S. Hirokawa N.

However, the mechanisms coordinating late endocytic transport and lysosomal maturation, and therefore autophagy-lysosomal function in neurons, remain to be elucidated. Snapin was first identified as a neuronal SNARE-binding protein (Ilardi et al., 1999Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Snapin: A SNARE-associated protein implicated in synaptic transmission.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) critical in priming large dense-core vesicles for fusion in chromaffin cells (Tian et al., 2005Tian J.H. Wu Z.X. Unzicker M.

Snapin facilitates the synchronization of synaptic vesicle fusion.Neuron. 2009; 61: 412-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Snapin is also present in membrane-associated fractions (Buxton et al., 2003Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Identification and characterization of Snapin as a ubiquitously expressed SNARE-binding protein that interacts with SNAP23 in non-neuronal cells.Biochem.

Dell'Angelica E.C. Identification of snapin and three novel proteins (BLOS1, BLOS2, and BLOS3/reduced pigmentation) as subunits of biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1).J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28393-28401Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), highlighting its multivalent role in intracellular trafficking events. Because snapin−/− neurons display striking accumulation of late endocytic organelles, we investigated its role in late endocytic trafficking. Using biochemical, cellular, and time-lapse imaging approaches in snapin mutant cortical neurons, combined with gene rescue experiments, we reveal a critical role for Snapin in coordinating late endocytic transport and lysosomal maturation—two dynamic cellular processes required for the proper function of the autophagy-lysosomal system in neurons. Such defects result in reduced neuron viability and neurodegeneration. We first examined the intracellular distribution of lysosomes in cultured cortical neurons from snapin+/+ and snapin−/− embryos with antibodies against microtubule-associated proteins-2 (MAP2), a neuronal marker, and lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1), a membrane protein associated with lysosomes. snapin−/− neurons showed an increased mean intensity of LAMP-1 by 78% (p < 0.001) relative to snapin+/+ neurons (Figure 1A ). We then reintroduced the snapin transgene into the mutant neurons by transfection at 4 days in vitro (DIV4) and immunostained for LAMP-1 and MAP2 at DIV8. Snapin gain of function reduced the mean intensity of LAMP-1 in the soma by 40% relative to neurons expressing GFP control (Figure 1B). Next, we examined the ultrastructural distribution of late endocytic compartments in cortical neurons using immuno-electron microscopy with an antibody against cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors (CI-MPR), a membrane protein preferentially located in late endosomes and immature, but not mature, lysosomes (Griffiths et al., 1988Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. The mannose 6-phosphate receptor and the biogenesis of lysosomes.Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). CI-MPR-labeled organelles were intensely accumulated in snapin−/− neurons at DIV7 (Figures 1C and 1D). Average immunogold-labeled entities per soma section were 1.60 ± 0.25 for snapin+/+ and 6.25 ± 0.70 for snapin−/− cortical culture (SEM, p < 0.01), and average gold grains per soma section were 46.80 ± 6.72 for snapin+/+ and 141.58 ± 13.96 for snapin−/− cortical culture (p < 0.01). We also performed sequential immunoblots of cortical neuron lysates with various antibodies on the same blot membrane (Figure 1E). Increased intensities of both LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 were consistently observed in snapin−/− neurons, while expression of other organelle markers including EEA1 (early endosomes), p115 (Golgi), and Calnexin (ER) exhibited no detectable change between snapin+/+ and snapin−/− neurons. To further determine whether the accumulated LAMP-1-labeled organelles represent immature lysosomes, we first assessed the maturation of lysosomal hydrolases, which are normally transported from the TGN through late endosomes to lysosomes. Cathepsin D has been widely used as a reporter molecule for trafficking and maturation of lysosomal hydrolases; its mature light and heavy chains are produced by cleavage of its intermediate chain upon exposure to the acidic environment in mature lysosomes (Figure 1F). Any change in its mature forms reflects altered late endocytic trafficking or perturbed lysosomal maturation. Relative to their wild-type littermates, snapin−/− exhibited reduced mature heavy (30 kDa) and light (14 kDa) chains by 22.5% ± 4.5% and 45.9% ± 4.0%, respectively, and conversely, exhibited an increase in its intermediate forms (38–45 kDa) by 30.7% ± 6.3% in brain homogenates (Figure 1G). To confirm defective maturation of lysosomal hydrolases, we alternatively labeled active cathepsin D in neurons by applying Bodipy-FL-pepstatin A, a fluorescence-tagged pepstatin A that binds specifically to the active site of cathepsin D in acidic lysosomes (Chen et al., 2000Chen C.S. Chen W.N. Zhou M. Arttamangkul S. Haugland R.P. Probing the cathepsin D using a BODIPY FL-pepstatin A: Applications in fluorescence polarization and microscopy.J. Biochem. Biophys.

Whereas the majority of lysosomes were costained with Bodipy-FL-pepstatin A-labeled active cathepsin D in snapin+/+ neurons, colocalization of active cathepsin D with LAMP-1 was substantially lower in snapin−/− neurons (Figure 1H). The normalized mean intensity of Bodipy-FL-pepstatin A in snapin−/− neurons was reduced by 46.1% ± 2.6% (n = 15, p < 0.001) relative to snapin+/+ neurons (n = 14), suggesting impaired maturation of cathepsin D, and thus a reduced capacity of lysosomal degradation after snapin deletion. We then examined whether snapin deficiency impacts cortical neuron viability in high-density culture. In neurons stained with neuron-specific class III β-tubulin antibody at DIV10, swelling puncta with diameters larger than processes were present along β-tubulin-labeled snapin−/−, but not snapin+/+, axonal processes (Figure S1A available online); similar structures were absent in MAP2-labeled snapin−/− dendrites from the same neurons, reflecting axonal swellings or axonal degeneration. snapin−/− neurons maintained their growth density as well as snapin+/+ neurons until DIV8, after which the density was gradually reduced (Figure S1B). By DIV14, neuronal density was reduced to 44.7% ± 5.3% relative to that of wild-type neurons, suggesting reduced viability in mature snapin−/− neurons. We next stained cortical culture through DIV0–14 with propidium iodide (PI), a vital dye labeling the nucleus in dying cells lacking an intact plasma membrane (data not shown). Normalized number of PI-labeled dying cells increased by 7.5% ± 1.8% (DIV10, p < 0.001) and 7.0% ± 1.9% (DIV14, p = 0.003) in snapin−/− cortical culture relative to snapin+/+ culture, which is consistent with reduced neuronal growth density (Figure S1B). Furthermore, total and average dendrite length and total branch points in snapin−/− cortical neurons were reduced relative to that of their wild-type controls (Figures S1C and S1D). Homozygous snapin mice die perinatally (Tian et al., 2005Tian J.H. Wu Z.X. Unzicker M. Lu L. Cai Q. Li C. Schirra C. Matti U. Stevens D. Deng C. et al.The role of Snapin in neurosecretion: Snapin knock-out mice exhibit impaired calcium-dependent exocytosis of large dense-core vesicles in chromaffin cells.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10546-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, reduced viability, axonal swellings, and developmental defects in snapin-deficient neurons may be attributable, at least in part, to the embryonic lethal phenotype of snapin null mice. We assessed the lysosomal degradation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) in neurons. Endogenous EGFRs were primarily stained on the neuronal surface before EGF incubation. Following EGF treatment, EGFRs were internalized and clustered into large puncta. At 3 hr after EGF incubation, the normalized EGFR mean intensity reaches high levels with no detectable difference between snapin+/+ and snapin−/− neurons (Figures 2A and 2B ). However, at 7 hr after EGF, a significant portion (35.82% ± 2.8%, p < 0.001) of internalized EGFRs was degraded in snapin+/+ neurons while almost all EGFR puncta (93.59% ± 5.86%, p = 0.397) retained in snapin−/− neurons, suggesting a reduced capacity of lysosomal degradation after snapin deletion. We next coimmunostained mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and verified that snapin deletion resulted in aberrant accumulation of late endosomes/immature lysosomes colabeled with LAMP-1 and CI-MPR (Figure S2A). In addition, the normalized mean intensity of acidic mature lysosomes labeled by the fluorescent pH indicator LysoSensor dye is substantially lower in snapin−/− MEFs relative to that in snapin+/+ cells (p < 0.001) (Figure 2C), consistently indicating that LAMP-1-labeled organelles in both snapin−/− neurons and MEFs are primarily immature lysosomes. Given that snapin−/− MEFs exhibit a similar accumulation of immature lysosomes, we next assessed late endocytic trafficking for the delivery and degradation of endocytosed proteins by performing three types of pulse-chase analyses using MEFs. MEFs have large, flat cell bodies, allowing us to analyze late endocytic trafficking in greater detail. We first applied Alexa 488-conjugated EGF to monitor internalization and subsequent delivery to, and degradation in, lysosomes (Futter et al., 1996Futter C.E. Pearse A. Hewlett L.J. Hopkins C.R. Multivesicular endosomes containing internalized EGF-EGF receptor complexes mature and then fuse directly with lysosomes.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). There was no detectable difference in the normalized mean intensities of 488-EGF internalization between snapin−/− and snapin+/+ cells at a 10 min pulse (p = 0.23) and a 30 min pulse (p = 0.31). However, we observed an increased retention of internalized 488-EGF after a 3 hr chase in snapin−/− cells (Figure 2D). In contrast, the majority of internalized 488-EGF in snapin+/+ cells was degraded. Analysis of mean intensities revealed reduced degradation efficiency in snapin−/− cells relative to controls (p = 0.001) (Figure 2E). We then immunostained MEFs following the pulse chase. The retained EGF signals predominantly colocalized with CI-MPR (Figure S2B), but not with EEA1 (Figure S2C), suggesting that EGF was retained in late endosomes. Western blot analysis further revealed that snapin deficiency significantly reduced EGFR degradation kinetics for up to 150 min compared with snapin+/+ MEFs (Figure S2D). Furthermore, there was no detectable change in transferrin uptake or recycling in the snapin−/− MEFs (Figure S2E), thus excluding the possibility of defective trafficking along the early endocytic pathway. We performed a second pulse-chase assay using Alexa 488-dextran conjugates. Dextran moves along the same pathway as EGF following internalization but remains stable in lysosomes due to the lack of related hydrolases; altered dextran trafficking indicates impaired endosomal-lysosomal trafficking independent of lysosomal hydrolysis. MEFs were incubated with Alexa 488-dextran for 16 hr followed by a 4 hr chase to ensure that all internalized dextran was delivered to lysosomes. In snapin+/+ MEFs, dextran colocalized with LAMP-I, but not with CI-MPR, confirming their targeting to mature lysosomes. In contrast, the internalized dextran in snapin−/− cells colocalized with CI-MPR (Figure 2F), but not with transferrin-labeled early/recycling endosomes (Figure S2F), indicating that dextran was retained in late endosomes rather than delivered to lysosomes. To assess lysosomal degradative capacity at an ultrastructural level, we used electron microscopy to monitor the fate of internalized bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated with colloidal gold (BSA-gold). Internalized BSA-gold following fluid phase endocytosis and a pulse-chase protocol are flocculated within the late endocytic compartments after proteolytic degradation of BSA (Griffiths et al., 1988Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. The mannose 6-phosphate receptor and the biogenesis of lysosomes.Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, Bright et al., 1997Bright N.A. Reaves B.J. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. Dense core lysosomes can fuse with late endosomes and are re-formed from the resultant hybrid organelles.J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2027-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flocculation of gold particles in snapin+/+ MEFs was almost complete (99.09% ± 0.91%, n = 79 sections) after incubation with the conjugates for 4 hr at 37°C, followed by a 24 hr chase in conjugate-free medium (Figure 2G). However, in snapin−/− cells 38.24% ± 1.10% (n = 96 sections, p < 0.01, Student's t test) of BSA-gold conjugates remained as discrete particles, indicating impaired lysosomal degradative capacity. Thus, defects in the transport of internalized proteins and hydrolase precursors from late endosomes to lysosomes could synergistically reduce lysosomal degradative capacity, thereby contributing to the severe phenotypes observed in snapin-deficient cells. Degradation of cytoplasmic constituents via autophagy primarily occurs upon fusion with lysosomes. Although autophagy is generally viewed as a stress-induced process, recent studies have highlighted its role during neuronal development and neurodegeneration (Komatsu et al., 2006Komatsu M. Waguri S. Chiba T. Murata S. Iwata J. Tanida I. Ueno T. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K.

Autophagy gene-dependent clearance of apoptotic cells during embryonic development.Cell. 2007; 128: 931-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether Snapin was also necessary for proper autophagy function. Electron microscopy of the hippocampus from snapin−/− E18 brains demonstrated abnormal accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (Avd) (Figure 3A ). Some of the Avd structures represent late Avd following fusion with lysosomes, based on the morphologically defined features that (1) contained partially degraded cytoplasmic material with higher electron density, and (2) were labeled by anti-LAMP-1 immunogold (Figure 3B) (Kirkegaard et al., 2004Kirkegaard K. Taylor M.P. Jackson W.T. Cellular autophagy: Surrender, avoidance and subversion by microorganisms.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Avd accumulation may reflect increased formation of autophagosomes or reduced clearance of autolysosomes. The latter could be due to a reduction of lysosomal degradation. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we performed six types of experiments as recommended (Klionsky et al., 2008Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. Agostinis P. Agrawal D.K. Aliev G. Askew D.S. Baba M. Baehrecke E.H. Bahr B.A. Ballabio A. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy in higher eukaryotes.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 151-175PubMed Google Scholar). First, we analyzed autophagic marker LC3 in brain homogenates and MEF lysates. Deleting snapin substantially increased LC3, particularly LC3-II, under both starvation and nonstarvation conditions (Figure 3C). LC3-II is a lipidated form of LC3-I that inserts into autophagic membranes (Kabeya et al., 2000Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar) where it is eventually degraded by lysosomal hydrolases. Second, we examined autophagy markers p62/SQSTM1 (Bjørkøy et al., 2005Bjørkøy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. p62/SQSTM1 forms protein aggregates degraded by autophagy and has a protective effect on huntingtin-induced cell death.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar) and LC3-II in nonstarved cortical neuron lysates before and after treatment with lysosomal inhibitors (LIs) leupeptin and pepstatin A. Increased amounts of p62 and LC3-II were detected in snapin−/− neurons (Figure 3D). This phenotype mimics that resulting from treatment with LIs in snapin+/+ neurons. In contrast, the same treatment of snapin−/− neurons failed to significantly increase LC3-II levels (p = 0.07) (Figure 3E), reflecting reduced clearance of autolysosomes after snapin deletion. Third, we transfected GFP-LC3 in cortical neurons at DIV5 and treated them with LIs at DIV6. GFP-LC3 appeared in vesicular structures in the soma of snapin−/− neurons but in a diffuse pattern in snapin+/+ neurons (Figure 3F). Deleting snapin significantly increased GFP-LC3 puncta (65.78 ± 14.50 per cell, p < 0.01) relative to snapin+/+ neurons (11.06 ± 1.44 per cell) (Figure 3G). In snapin+/+ neurons, GFP-LC3 signals were recruited into vesicular structures in the presence of LIs, and the number of GFP-LC3 puncta increased to 61.25 ± 8.73 per cell (p < 0.01). In contrast, the same treatment of snapin−/− neurons with LIs failed to significantly increase the number of LC3-II puncta (91.22 ± 12.85, p = 0.19). Thus, our biochemical and cell imaging analysis suggest reduced clearance of autolysosomes after snapin deletion. Our interpretation is consistent with the current understanding of LC3 flux: if a gene mutation increases LC3-II levels in the absence of LIs, but there is no further increase in LIs, then there is likely a blockage of LC3-II degradation via autolysosomes (Klionsky et al., 2008Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. Agostinis P. Agrawal D.K. Aliev G. Askew D.S. Baba M. Baehrecke E.H. Bahr B.A. Ballabio A. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy in higher eukaryotes.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 151-175PubMed Google Scholar). Three more lines of evidence further support our notion. First, deleting snapin has no effect on the formation of autophagosomes in MEFs following starvation. Enhanced autophagy can be efficiently rescued by reintroducing a snapin transgene (Figures S3A–S3D). Second, we immuno-isolated LAMP-1-labeled membranous organelles and detected increased p62 and LC3-II from the purified autolysosomal organelles in snapin−/− mice relative to that in wild-type littermates (Figure 3H). Third, we immunostained GFP-LC3-transfected MEFs with LAMP-1 and found that colocalization of GFP-LC3 with LAMP-1 in snapin−/− cells increased by 38.9% ± 3.7% (p < 0.001) relative to those of snapin+/+ cells in response to starvation (Figures S3E and S3F), suggesting that accumulated GFP-LC3 structures are largely composed of autolysosomes. Thus, our studies consistently support our notion that snapin deficiency reduces clearance of autolysosomes due to impaired lysosomal degradative capacity. Aberrant accumulation of immature lysosomes, impaired degradation of internalized proteins, and reduced clearance of autolysosomes in snapin−/− cells reflect altered late endosome-lysosome membrane trafficking. To elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying the snapin-deficient phenotypes, we examined the distribution of late endocytic organelles in cortical neurons expressing the late endosome marker YFP-Rab7. In snapin+/+ neurons, late endosomes appeared as small, fine vesicular structures evenly distributed along processes (Figure 4A ). Surprisingly, late endosomes were clustered along snapin−/− processes (Figure 4B). We then performed time-lapse imaging in live cortical neurons to assess the relative mobility of late endosomes along axons. Consistent with a previous report (Deinhardt et al., 2006Deinhardt K. Salinas S. Verastegui C. Watson R. Worth D. Hanrahan S. Bucci C. Schiavo G. Rab5 and Rab7 control endocytic sorting along the axonal retrograde transport pathway.Neuron. 2006; 52: 293-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), Rab7-labeled late endosomes exhibited active retrograde transport toward the soma in snapin+/+ neurons (Figure 4D, Movie S1). In contrast, snapin deletion resulted in defective retrograde transport of the organelles and consequently increased their ratio in the stationary phase (Movie S2). Reintroducing the snapin transgene into snapin−/− neurons not only rescued the defective retrograde transport, but also enhanced retrograde transport relative to snapin+/+ neurons (Figures 4C–4E, Movie S3). The transport defect was specific for late endocytic organelles because snapin deficiency had no observable effect on the distribution and axonal transport of mitochondria and early endosomes or distribution of ER and Golgi (Figure S4). Two-channel time-lapse imaging further demonstrated that in snapin−/− neurons, while late endosomes were predominantly stationary, mitochondria were dynamically mobile along the same axon (Movie S4). To examine whether Snapin associates with late endocytic compartments, we immuno-isolated Snapin- or LAMP-1-associated membrane organelles using magnetic beads coated with antibodies against Snapin or LAMP-1. Snapin was detected together with Rab7, CI-MPR, and LAMP-1, as well as late endocytic SNARE proteins including syntaxin7, syntaxin8, and Vti1b VAMP8 (Figures 5A and 5B ). The relative purity was confirmed by the a"

Using NMR, X-ray crystallography and thermodynamic measurements, we analyzed the substrate recognition process of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), finding that entropy and protein dynamics play a prominent role. The nucleotide acts as a dynamic and allosteric activator by coupling the two lobes of apo PKA, enhancing the enzyme dynamics synchronously and priming it for catalysis. The formation of the ternary complex is entropically driven, and NMR spin relaxation data reveal that both substrate and PKA are dynamic in the closed state. Our results show that the enzyme toggles between open and closed states, which indicates that a conformational selection rather than an induced-fit mechanism governs substrate recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2027089076,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) have long been considered as extracellular proton (H(+))-gated cation channels, and peripheral ASIC3 channels seem to be a natural sensor of acidic pain. Here, we report the identification of a nonproton sensor on ASIC3. We show first that 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ) causes persistent ASIC3 channel activation at the normal pH. Using GMQ as a probe and combining mutagenesis and covalent modification analysis, we then uncovered a ligand sensor lined by residues around E423 and E79 of the extracellular ""palm"" domain of the ASIC3 channel that is crucial for activation by nonproton activators. Furthermore, we show that GMQ activates sensory neurons and causes pain-related behaviors in an ASIC3-dependent manner, indicating the functional significance of ASIC activation by nonproton ligands. Thus, natural ligands beyond protons may activate ASICs under physiological and pathological conditions through the nonproton ligand sensor, serving for channel activation independent of abrupt and marked acidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2057101237,"Neurons exhibit rhythmic activity that ultimately affects behavior such as sleep. In living zebrafish larvae, we used time-lapse two-photon imaging of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin in hypocretin/orexin (HCRT) neurons to determine the dynamics of synaptic modifications during the day and night. We observed circadian rhythmicity in synapse number in HCRT axons. This rhythm is regulated primarily by the circadian clock but is also affected by sleep deprivation. Furthermore, NPTX2, a protein implicated in AMPA receptor clustering, modulates circadian synaptic changes. In zebrafish, nptx2b is a rhythmic gene that is mostly expressed in hypothalamic and pineal gland cells. Arrhythmic transgenic nptx2b overexpression (hcrt:NPTX2b) increases synapse number and abolishes rhythmicity in HCRT axons. Finally, hcrt:NPTX2b fish are resistant to the sleep-promoting effects of melatonin. This behavioral effect is consistent with NPTX2b-mediated increased activity of HCRT circuitry. These data provide real-time in vivo evidence of circadian and homeostatic regulation of structural synaptic plasticity."

IntroductionThe advent of large-scale liquid fuel production from biomass has served to highlight how difficult it is to commercially process biomass effectively and efficiently. Much of the difficulty is due to the recalcitrant nature of lignocelluloses (1Chen F. Dixon R.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 759-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), a complex interlinking structure composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin that makes up the bulk of terrestrial biomass. Accessibility to the cell wall is influenced by lignin, which provides structural integrity to the cell wall. Both total lignin content and lignin monomer composition may impact the ease with which biomass is processed. This study examines whether lignin molecular weight is altered by changing the lignin monomer composition and if these changes affect the ease with which lignin can be removed by chemical processing.Three monomers (Fig. 1), 4-coumaryl alcohol (H), 2The abbreviations used are: H4-coumaryl alcoholGconiferyl alcoholSsinapyl alcoholC3Hp-coumarate 3-hydroxylaseHCThydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyltransferaseGPCgel permeation chromatographyCP/MAScross-polarization/magic angle spinningMppeak average molecular weightMwweight average molecular weight. coniferyl alcohol (G), and sinapyl alcohol (S), polymerize in what is thought to be a combinatorial fashion to form the bulk of the lignin polymer (2Sarkanen K.V.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin1968: 95-163Google Scholar). The amount of each unit depends on the species, age, cell type, and tissue type (4Whetten R.W. MacKay J.J. Sederoff R.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol.

Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2001: 1-64Google Scholar). The presence of each additional methoxy group on a lignin unit results in one less reactive site (S < G < H) and therefore fewer possible combinations during the polymerization reaction. For example, the S unit has no vacant 5-position; therefore 5,5′-cross-linking is unavailable for lignin S subunits. As a result, lignin rich in S subunits is more easily depolymerized than lignin rich in G subunits.The relative level of S and G lignin subunits is expressed as the S/G ratio, an important measurement used in the assessment of biomass. H lignin subunits are present in low levels in natural materials (4.9% of lignin in wild-type alfalfa (1Chen F. Dixon R.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 759-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) and 0.8% in Norway Spruce (6Wadenback J. Clapham D. Gellerstedt G. von Arnold S. Holzforschung. 2004; 58: 107-115Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar)); consequently, less is known about lignin high in H subunits and its impact on biomass processing.In addition to the core H/G/S polymer, lignin includes a range of other structures commonly bonded to the main lignin structure through ether or ester linkages. Such modifications are especially frequent in herbaceous species and usually involve the addition of p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and occasionally sinapic acid. The modifications can take the form of cross-linking groups between lignin and carbohydrate (7Lam T.B.T. Iiyama K.

Both C3H and HCT genes are involved in the production of S and G lignin monomers but not H monomers in the lignin biosynthetic pathway. Their down-regulation is therefore expected to reduce production of S and G monomers and to lead to an increased incorporation of H monomers in the lignin constructed by the plant (14Chiang V.L.

In sequential extraction, progressively more aggressive treatments are used to fractionate the biomass. In the case presented here, three extractions were used: MeOH extraction to remove non-structural cell wall components, 0.1 m NaOH (overnight, 4 °C) to remove highly labile cell wall-bound phenolics, and 2 m NaOH (10 min, 110 °C oil bath) to remove less labile cell wall-bound phenolics. We observed a higher removal of cell wall components under the base extraction conditions for the transgenic lines compared with the controls, indicating differences in the chemical and/or physical construction of the cell wall after transgenic modification of the lignin biosynthetic pathway. In addition, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of isolated ball-milled lignin indicated smaller lignin in the transgenic lines. IntroductionThe advent of large-scale liquid fuel production from biomass has served to highlight how difficult it is to commercially process biomass effectively and efficiently. Much of the difficulty is due to the recalcitrant nature of lignocelluloses (1Chen F. Dixon R.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 759-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), a complex interlinking structure composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin that makes up the bulk of terrestrial biomass. Accessibility to the cell wall is influenced by lignin, which provides structural integrity to the cell wall. Both total lignin content and lignin monomer composition may impact the ease with which biomass is processed. This study examines whether lignin molecular weight is altered by changing the lignin monomer composition and if these changes affect the ease with which lignin can be removed by chemical processing.Three monomers (Fig. 1), 4-coumaryl alcohol (H), 2The abbreviations used are: H4-coumaryl alcoholGconiferyl alcoholSsinapyl alcoholC3Hp-coumarate 3-hydroxylaseHCThydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyltransferaseGPCgel permeation chromatographyCP/MAScross-polarization/magic angle spinningMppeak average molecular weightMwweight average molecular weight. coniferyl alcohol (G), and sinapyl alcohol (S), polymerize in what is thought to be a combinatorial fashion to form the bulk of the lignin polymer (2Sarkanen K.V.

Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2001: 1-64Google Scholar). The presence of each additional methoxy group on a lignin unit results in one less reactive site (S < G < H) and therefore fewer possible combinations during the polymerization reaction. For example, the S unit has no vacant 5-position; therefore 5,5′-cross-linking is unavailable for lignin S subunits. As a result, lignin rich in S subunits is more easily depolymerized than lignin rich in G subunits.The relative level of S and G lignin subunits is expressed as the S/G ratio, an important measurement used in the assessment of biomass. H lignin subunits are present in low levels in natural materials (4.9% of lignin in wild-type alfalfa (1Chen F. Dixon R.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 759-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) and 0.8% in Norway Spruce (6Wadenback J. Clapham D. Gellerstedt G. von Arnold S. Holzforschung. 2004; 58: 107-115Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar)); consequently, less is known about lignin high in H subunits and its impact on biomass processing.In addition to the core H/G/S polymer, lignin includes a range of other structures commonly bonded to the main lignin structure through ether or ester linkages. Such modifications are especially frequent in herbaceous species and usually involve the addition of p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and occasionally sinapic acid.

Both C3H and HCT genes are involved in the production of S and G lignin monomers but not H monomers in the lignin biosynthetic pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2061590297,"Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which consist of highly phosphorylated tau, are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease (AD). In neurodegenerative diseases, neuronal dysfunction due to neuronal loss and synaptic loss accompanies NFT formation, suggesting that a process associated with NFT formation may be involved in neuronal dysfunction. To clarify the relationship between the tau aggregation process and synapse and neuronal loss, we compared two lines of mice expressing human tau with or without an aggregation-prone P301L mutation. P301L tau transgenic (Tg) mice exhibited neuronal loss and produced sarcosyl-insoluble tau in old age but did not exhibit synaptic loss and memory impairment. By contrast, wild-type tau Tg mice neither exhibited neuronal loss nor produced sarcosyl-insoluble tau but did exhibit synaptic loss and memory impairment. Moreover, P301L tau was less phosphorylated than wild-type tau, suggesting that the tau phosphorylation state is involved in synaptic loss, whereas the tau aggregation state is involved in neuronal loss. Finally, increasing concentrations of insoluble tau aggregates leads to the formation of fibrillar tau, which causes NFTs to form."

https://openalex.org/W2059087166,"A key step in the triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthetic pathway is the final acylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) by DAG acyltransferase. In silico analysis has revealed that the DCR (defective in cuticular ridges) (At5g23940) gene has a typical HX(4)D acyltransferase motif at the N-terminal end and a lipid binding motif VX(2)GF at the middle of the sequence. To understand the biochemical function, the gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant protein was found to acylate DAG specifically in an acyl-CoA-dependent manner. Overexpression of At5g23940 in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae quadruple mutant deficient in DAG acyltransferases resulted in TAG accumulation. At5g23940 rescued the growth of this quadruple mutant in the oleate-containing medium, whereas empty vector control did not. Lipid particles were localized in the cytosol of At5g23940-transformed quadruple mutant cells, as observed by oil red O staining. There was an incorporation of 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid into TAG in At5g23940-transformed cells of quadruple mutant. Here we report a soluble acyl-CoA-dependent DAG acyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana. Taken together, these data suggest that a broad specific DAG acyltransferase may be involved in the cutin as well as in the TAG biosynthesis by supplying hydroxy fatty acid."
https://openalex.org/W2067910794,"The microenvironment of the mammary gland has been shown to exert a deterministic control over cells from different normal organs during murine mammary gland regeneration in transplantation studies. When mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-neu-induced tumor cells were mixed with normal mammary epithelial cells (MECs) in a dilution series and inoculated into epithelium-free mammary fat pads, they were redirected to non-carcinogenic cell fates by interaction with untransformed MECs during regenerative growth. In the presence of non-transformed MECs (50:1), tumor cells interacted with MECs to generate functional chimeric outgrowths. When injected alone, tumor cells invariably produced tumors. Here, the normal microenvironment redirects MMTV-neu-transformed tumorigenic cells to participate in the regeneration of a normal, functional mammary gland. In addition, the redirected tumor cells show the capacity to differentiate into normal mammary cell types, including luminal, myoepithelial and secretory. The results indicate that signals emanating from a normal mammary microenvironment, comprised of stromal, epithelial and host-mediated signals, combine to suppress the cancer phenotype during glandular regeneration. Clarification of these signals offers improved therapeutic possibilities for the control of mammary cancer growth."
https://openalex.org/W1986351570,"Many ion channels are modulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)), but studies examining the PIP(2) dependence of channel activity have been limited to cell expression systems, which present difficulties for controlling membrane composition. We have characterized the PIP(2) dependence of purified human Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 activity using (86)Rb(+) flux and patch clamp assays in liposomes of defined composition. We definitively show that these channels are directly activated by PIP(2) and that PIP(2) is absolutely required in the membrane for channel activity. The results provide the first quantitative description of the dependence of eukaryotic Kir channel function on PIP(2) levels in the membrane; Kir2.1 shows measureable activity in as little as 0.01% PIP(2), and open probability increases to ∼0.4 at 1% PIP(2). Activation of Kir2.1 by phosphatidylinositol phosphates is also highly selective for PIP(2); PI, PI(4)P, and PI(5)P do not activate channels, and PI(3,4,5)P(3) causes minimal activity. The PIP(2) dependence of eukaryotic Kir activity is almost exactly opposite that of KirBac1.1, which shows marked inhibition by PIP(2). This raises the interesting hypothesis that PIP(2) activation of eukaryotic channels reflects an evolutionary adaptation of the channel to the appearance of PIP(2) in the eukaryotic cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2049933481,"The molecular pathways controlling cerebellar Purkinje cell dendrite formation and maturation are poorly understood. The Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mutant mouse is characterized by mutations in Nna1, a gene discovered in an axonal regenerative context, but whose actual function in development and disease is unknown. We found abnormal development of Purkinje cell dendrites in postnatal pcd(Sid) mice and linked this deficit to a deletion mutation in exon 7 of Nna1. With single cell gene profiling and virus-based gene transfer, we analyzed a molecular pathway downstream to Nna1 underlying abnormal Purkinje cell dendritogenesis in pcd(Sid) mice. We discovered that mutant Nna1 dramatically increases intranuclear localization of lysyl oxidase propeptide, which interferes with NF-κB RelA signaling and microtubule-associated protein regulation of microtubule stability, leading to underdevelopment of Purkinje cell dendrites. These findings provide insight into Nna1's role in neuronal development and why its absence renders Purkinje cells more vulnerable."

Exaggerated de novo lipid synthesis is also found in certain highly proliferative, aggressive tumors. Here, we show that in Shh-driven medulloblastomas, Rb is inactivated and E2F1 is upregulated, promoting lipogenesis. Extensive lipid accumulation and elevated levels of the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) mark those tumors. In primary cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs), proposed Shh-associated medulloblastoma cells-of-origin, Shh signaling triggers E2F1 and FASN expression, whereas suppressing fatty acid oxidation (FAO), in a smoothened-dependent manner. In the developing cerebellum, E2F1 and FASN co-localize in proliferating CGNPs. in vivo and in vitro, E2F1 is required for FASN expression and CGNP proliferation, and E2F1 knockdown impairs Shh-mediated FAO inhibition. Pharmacological blockade of Rb inactivation and/or lipogenesis inhibits CGNP proliferation, drives medulloblastoma cell death and extends survival of medulloblastoma-bearing animals In vivo. These findings identify a novel mechanism through which Shh signaling links cell cycle progression to lipid synthesis, through E2F1-dependent regulation of lipogenic enzymes. These findings pertinent to the etiology of tumor metabolism also underscore the key role of the Shh→E2F1→FASN axis in regulating de novo lipid synthesis in cancers, and as such its value as a global therapeutic target in hedgehog-dependent and/or Rb-inactivated tumors."

To investigate the contribution of OAT1 and OAT3 in various nephron segments, the OAT-selective fluorescent tracer substrates 5-carboxyfluorescein and 6-carboxyfluorescein were used.

This functional localization indicates a complex three-dimensional context, which needs to be considered for metabolites, toxins, and drugs (e.g. antivirals) handled by both transporters. These results also raise the possibility of functional differences in the relative importance of OAT1 and OAT3 in antiviral handling in developing and mature tissue.

However, it is OAT1 and OAT3, which are both located on the basolateral membrane of the proximal renal tubule, that are primarily responsible for renal uptake and are therefore likely to play rate-limiting roles in regulating the distribution of drugs, toxins, and metabolites between blood and urine. However, most studies have been performed using simple in vitro systems, and many unanswered questions remain about the function at the level of the whole organ. Moreover, it has been suggested that “remote sensing and signaling” occur between oat homologs in multiple tissues/organs and fluid compartments (e.g. blood and urine) via organic anion metabolites and/or signaling molecules (1Nigam S.K.

Blantz R.C. Bhatnagar V. Nigam S.K. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2003; 12: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Detailed functional information concerning kidney transporters present at the blood-urine barrier is crucial for understanding the nephrotoxicity of these antivirals and would help advance the development of new therapeutics. Data on compartmentalization of antivirals between blood and urine could also help provide a systemic view of antiviral distribution, elimination, and toxicity. This type of analysis has not been attempted due to a paucity of techniques to address the role of specific genes in three-dimensional contexts.Previous studies on antivirals have concluded that OAT1 and, to a lesser extent, OAT3 play a major role in transport of antiviral drugs such as adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir. For example, OAT1 has been shown to be the major transporter for adefovir (10Servais A. Lechat P. Zahr N. Urien S. Aymard G. Jaudon M.C. Deray G. Isnard Bagnis C. Nephrol. Ther. 2005; 1: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 11Servais A. Lechat P. Zahr N. Urien S. Aymard G. Jaudon M.C. Deray G. Isnard Bagnis C. Eur. J.

Cihlar T. Robinson K.L. Tong L. Vela J.E. Fuller M.D. Wieman L.M. Eisenberg E.J. Rhodes G.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The interaction of OAT1 and OAT3 with a larger set of antivirals has also been investigated in vitro (3Truong D.M. Kaler G. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol.

Moreover, a novel visualization approach for fluorescent organic anion uptake in adult renal slices provided information on the functional localization of the OATs that functionally establishes the likely contributions of particular nephron segments to drug and toxin transport. The results also raise the possibility of different OATs being important in antiviral handling at different developmental stages.RESULTSTo begin to understand the relative contribution of OAT1 and OAT3 to antiviral handling in different tissues regulating the blood-urine interface, we employed three-dimensional assays utilizing wild-type and knock-out kidneys. Two kinds of three-dimensional ex vivo kidney assays were used: adult kidney slices and cultured whole embryonic kidney (which is allowed to differentiate in vitro). The latter has the considerable advantage of being a “live” assay in that the tissue continues to grow for ∼2–3 weeks.Functional Localization of OAT1 (in oat3 KOs) and OAT3 (in oat1 KOs) in Adult Kidney Using Fluorescent TracersA “classic” assay for analyzing transport in the adult kidney is the use of renal tissue slices, but this assay is not well validated for the determination of OAT1- and OAT3-specific transport. In fact, current data are contradictory. Although some studies suggest that this process occurs primarily in the proximal tubule, other immunolocalization data suggest that oat expression beyond this part of the nephron includes even the collecting ducts, a notion that does not have much physiological support (17Kojima R. Sekine T. Kawachi M. Cha S.H. Suzuki Y. Endou H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 848-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional consequence of the localization of OAT1 and OAT3 transport has not been previously established. This is obviously important for designing combination therapies, like those employing multiple antivirals as in HIV therapy, where competition at the transport step may be an important consideration. In addition, the increasing problem of drug-induced nephrotoxicity further illustrates the importance of understanding the molecular interaction between the transporters in the kidney and antivirals.To functionally define the relative contribution of OAT1 (in oat3 KOs) and OAT3 (in oat1 KOs) transporters to antiviral handling, as well as which nephron segments are involved, we determined the uptake patterns of the fluorescent OAT substrates 6CF and 5CF (3Truong D.M. Kaler G. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8654-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in adult kidney slices from the wild type and oat1 and oat3 KOs. The use of these fluorescent substrates to study OAT1 and OAT3 uptake is well established (3Truong D.M. Kaler G. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8654-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Kaler G. Truong D.M. Khandelwal A. Nagle M. Eraly S.A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23841-23853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This method allows for the direct visualization of transport and the anatomical localization of OAT function.Initially, we assessed CF uptake in fresh renal slices (coronal sections) from WT adults. These assays revealed discrete fluorescence throughout the cortex of the kidney (Fig. 1, A and B), with only background fluorescence in the outer medullary stripe for both 5CF and 6CF. Co-staining with D. biflorus lectin, a lectin that binds to collecting ducts (18Laitinen L. Virtanen I. Saxén L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Trifillis A.L. Exp. Nephrol. 1999; 7: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), demonstrated, importantly, a lack of CF uptake in collecting duct rays of the inner medulla as well those of the cortical collecting ducts. Inhibition of CF uptake by 2 mm probenecid confirmed OAT-mediated transport (Fig. 1, C and D). Interestingly, the cortical fluorescence patterns of 5CF and 6CF uptake were distinct. 5CF showed uptake throughout the cortical tubule, whereas 6CF manifested discrete areas of uptake in the juxtamedullary portion of the cortex, consistent with proximal tubule localization (Fig. 1, A and B). Given the differences in the kinetics of these tracers with respect to OAT1 and OAT3 (3Truong D.M. Kaler G. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8654-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the different fluorescence patterns observed are likely to reflect true differences in the functional transport by OAT1 and OAT3.To directly determine the intrarenal location of OAT3 function, we used renal slices from oat1 knock-outs. As we show below, these knock-outs do not exhibit significant gene expression changes in ABC and SLC transporters other than the oat knock-outs studied here. Because we are studying probenecid-inhibitable uptake, it is unlikely that the effects were OAT-independent. Two types of slices were generated: first, a coronal cut to delineate the uptake differences between the cortex, outer medulla, inner medulla, and pelvis; and second, a shallow coronal cut through just the cortex to determine the intracortical location of CF accumulation. As expected, loss of OAT1 eliminated the differences between 5CF and 6CF uptake (data not shown), indicating that either could be used to assess OAT3-mediated transport. The results of 5CF uptake in oat1 KOs (function of OAT3) are summarized in Fig. 2 (A, C, and E). No probenecid-sensitive uptake was seen in either the inner or outer medulla or renal pelvis; furthermore, D. biflorus lectin co-staining (Fig. 2A) showed that cortical collecting ducts also did not accumulate CF. However, as revealed by co-staining with Lotus lectin (Fig. 2, C and E), which preferentially binds to the mesenchymally derived nephron, proximal and distal tubules throughout the cortex accumulated significant cellular levels of CF, which was competed by probenecid. Circular gaps in the uptake pattern in the cortex resembled glomeruli in shape and location. These results suggest that OAT3 function is present in distal as well as proximal tubules (but not in glomeruli or collecting ducts).FIGURE 2Localization of fluorescent tracer 5CF in oat1 knock-out and fluorescent tracer 6CF in oat3 knock-out as a function of OAT3 and OAT1, respectively.

As in oat1 KOs, both 5CF and 6CF exhibited similar patterns. Both coronal and shallow cortex sections were exposed to 6CF (the preferred OAT1 substrate (3Truong D.M. Kaler G. Khandelwal A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8654-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2, B, D, and F). No probenecid-sensitive accumulation was seen in the medulla, renal pelvis, cortical collecting ducts, or presumptive glomeruli. Notably, probenecid-inhibitable uptake was seen in distinct patches in the cortex, similar to the pattern seen in wild-type slices incubated with 6CF (Fig. 2D).In the shallow coronal slice, uptake was seen in a grid-like pattern (Fig. 2D), with rectangular regions (“occlusions”) lacking uptake. Higher magnification revealed distinct tubules with or without OAT function (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that OAT1 is functionally sequestered into a distinct tubule type, consistent with proximal tubule localization. Importantly, this implies that OAT1- and OAT3-mediated transport is anatomically and functionally distinct. These results appear to be the first demonstration of the distribution of transport within the context of the whole organ and have broad implications for understanding system-wide drug, toxin, and metabolite handling. These considerations are particularly important for the design of combination antiviral therapies because in vitro oocyte transport data show that antivirals can be transported by OAT1, OAT3, or both (3Truong D.M.

The reductions in signal were normalized against CF uptake alone and probenecid inhibition. As described above, tissues from the oat KO animals were used to distinguish OAT1- and OAT3-mediated transport. OAT3-specific (in oat1 KOs) and OAT1-specific (in oat3 KOs) uptake of 6CF (1 μm) was tested in adult renal slices (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4).FIGURE 4Inhibition of 6CF uptake by antivirals in oat3 knock-out adult kidney slices (function of the OAT1 transporter).

These cultures, which alter with period of differentiation, express both OAT1 and OAT3 and manifest significant uptake of OAT substrates, including the fluorescent organic anions 5CF and 6CF, with this uptake being inhibitable by the classic OAT inhibitor probenecid. Moreover, the individual contribution of either OAT (OAT1 or OAT3) in isolation has also been studied by performing experiments in kidney organ cultures derived from mice null for the other OAT (transport of OAT substrates in oat1 knock-out tissue should be largely due to OAT3 and vice versa) (3Truong D.M.

In this study, we used the oat knock-out kidney organ culture assay to analyze antiviral interactions with OAT1 and OAT3. When tested in oat1 KO-derived tissues (function of OAT3), the uptake of 1 μm 6CF (Fig. 5A) was blocked by 2 mm probenecid (Fig. 5, B and H) and, to a varying degree, by the five antivirals: zidovudine (100 μm) (Fig. 5, C and H), acyclovir (200 μm) (Fig. 5, D and H), 100 μm tenofovir (100 μm) (Fig. 5, E and H), lamivudine (200 μm) (Fig. 5, F and H), and stavudine (1 mm) (Fig. 5, G and H). Similarly, tracer uptake by cultured kidneys derived from oat3 knock-outs (function of OAT1) was also inhibited by the antivirals (Fig. 6, A–H). Thus, our results suggest that these antivirals interact with OAT1 and OAT3 transporters in the cultured embryonic kidneys from the knock-out tissues.FIGURE 5Inhibition of 6CF uptake by antivirals in cultured oat1 knock-out embryonic kidneys in organ culture (function of OAT3). Fluorescent photomicrographs show 6CF (1 μm) uptake in cultured oat1 knock-out embryonic kidneys in the presence of a vehicle control (A), 2 mm probenecid (B), 100 μm zidovudine (C), 200 μm acyclovir (D), 100 μm tenofovir (E), 200 μm lamivudine (F), and 1 mm stavudine (G).

Although all five antivirals could inhibit OAT3-mediated 6CF interaction (oat1 KO cultures) by ∼50%, tenofovir, lamivudine, and zidovudine inhibited OAT1-mediated transport (oat3 KO kidney organ cultures) by >90% (Fig. 5, E, F, and C, respectively), whereas acyclovir inhibited it by >80% (Fig. 5D). Stavudine was the only compound for which inhibition of transport was comparable in oat1 and oat3 KO kidney organ cultures (Figs. 5G and 6G). These findings suggest a greater affinity of antivirals for OAT1 than for OAT3 in the embryonic kidney. Additionally, it is clear that there are significant differences between the adult and embryonic kidney three-dimensional assays. These differences, which may be clinically important, could be due to variations in post-translational modifications and might also represent tissue- and/or developmental stage-specific modulation of OAT function.Although the fluorescent substrate 5CF could also be handled by other transporters (including A"

In the adult human brain, six isoforms are expressed that differ by the presence or absence of the second of four semiconserved repeats. As a consequence, half of the tau isoforms have three repeats (3R tau), whereas the other half of the isoforms have four repeats (4R tau). Tauopathies can be characterized based on the isoform composition of their filaments. Alzheimer disease filamentous inclusions contain all isoforms. Pick disease filaments contain 3R tau. Progressive supranuclear palsy filaments contain 4R tau. Here, we used site-directed spin labeling of recombinant tau in conjunction with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to obtain structural insights into these filaments. We find that filaments of 4R tau and 3R tau share a highly ordered core structure in the third repeat with parallel, in-register arrangement of β-strands. This structure is conserved regardless of whether full-length isoforms (htau40 and htau23) or truncated constructs (K18 and K19) are used. When mixed, 3R tau and 4R tau coassemble into heterogeneous filaments. These filaments share the highly ordered core in the third repeat; however, they differ in their overall composition. Our findings indicate that at least three distinct types of filaments exist: homogeneous 3R tau, homogeneous 4R tau, and heterogeneous 3R/4R tau.

We describe an in vivo role for temporally patterned electrical activity, voltage-gated calcium channels, and CaMKII in modulating the response of Drosophila motoneurons to the chemorepellent Sema-2a during synaptic refinement. Mutations affecting the Sema-2a ligand, the plexin B receptor (plexB), the voltage-gated Ca(v)2.1 calcium channel (cac), or the voltage-gated Na(v)1 sodium channel (mlenap-ts;tipE) each result in ectopic neuromuscular contacts. Sema-2a interacts genetically with both of the channel mutations. The cac phenotype is enhanced by the Sema-2a mutation and is suppressed by either plexB overexpression or patterned, low-frequency (0.01 Hz) bouts of electrical activity in the embryo. The calcium-dependent suppression of ectopic contacts also depends on the downstream activation of CaMKII. These results indicate a role for patterned electrical activity and presynaptic calcium signaling, acting through CaMKII, in modulating a retrograde signal during the refinement of synaptic connections."

The metalloprotease FtsH has been suggested as responsible for the degradation of the D1 protein. We have analyzed the distribution and subunit structures of FtsH in spinach thylakoids and various membrane fractions derived from the thylakoids using clear native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. FtsH was found not only in the stroma thylakoids but also in the Photosystem II-enriched grana membranes. Monomeric, dimeric, and hexameric FtsH proteases were present as major subunit structures in thylakoids, whereas only hexameric FtsH proteases were detected in Triton X-100-solubilized Photosystem II membranes. Importantly, among the membrane fractions examined, hexameric FtsH proteases were most abundant in the Photosystem II membranes. In accordance with this finding, D1 degradation took place in the Photosystem II membranes under light stress. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis of thylakoids and the Photosystem II membranes solubilized with n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and a chemical cross-linking study of thylakoids showed localization of FtsH near the Photosystem II light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein supercomplexes in the grana. These results suggest that part of the FtsH hexamers are juxtapositioned to PSII complexes in the grana in darkness, carrying out immediate degradation of the photodamaged D1 protein under light stress."

The present study shows that somal CAPS1 plays an important role in DCV trafficking in the trans-Golgi network. The anti-CAPS1 antibody appeared to pull down membrane fractions, including many Golgi-associated proteins, such as ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) small GTPases. Biochemical analyses of the protein-protein interaction showed that CAPS1 interacted specifically with the class II ARF4/ARF5, but not with other classes of ARFs, via the pleckstrin homology domain in a GDP-bound ARF form-specific manner. The pleckstrin homology domain of CAPS1 showed high affinity for the Golgi membrane, thereby recruiting ARF4/ARF5 to the Golgi complex. Knockdown of either CAPS1 or ARF4/ARF5 expression caused accumulation of chromogranin, a DCV marker protein, in the Golgi, thereby reducing its DCV secretion. In addition, the overexpression of CAPS1 binding-deficient ARF5 mutants induced aberrant chromogranin accumulation in the Golgi and consequently reduced its DCV secretion.

https://openalex.org/W2075679680,"Phosphorylation of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein sensitizes cancer cells to various chemotherapeutics. However, the molecular mechanism underlying chemosensitization by phosphorylated FADD (P-FADD) is poorly understood. In this study, we describe the physical interactions and functional interplay between Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and FADD. Plk1 phosphorylates FADD at Ser-194 in response to treatment with taxol. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant, FADD S194D, caused degradation of Plk1 in an ubiquitin-independent manner, and delayed cytokinesis, consistent with the expected cellular phenotype of Plk1 deficiency. This demonstrates that Plk1 is regulated via a negative feedback loop by its substrate, FADD. Overexpression of FADD S194D sensitized HeLa cells to a low dose of taxol independently of caspase activation, whereas overexpression of FADD S194D resulted in caspase activation in response to a high dose of taxol. Therefore, we examined whether the death potential of P-FADD affected Plk1-mediated tumorigenesis. Transfection of FADD S194D inhibited colony formation by Plk1-overexpressing HeLa cells (HeLa-Plk1). Moreover, overexpression of FADD S194D suppressed tumorigenesis in nude mice xenografted with HeLa-Plk1. Therefore, this study reports the first in vivo validation of tumor-suppressing activity of P-FADD. Collectively, our data demonstrate that in response to taxol, Plk1 endows death-promoting and tumor-suppressor functions to its substrate, FADD."
https://openalex.org/W2014818104,"Epidermal lipoxygenase-3 (eLOX3) exhibits hydroperoxide isomerase activity implicated in epidermal barrier formation, but its potential dioxygenase activity has remained elusive. We identified herein a synthetic fatty acid, 9E,11Z,14Z-20:3ω6, that was oxygenated by eLOX3 specifically to the 9S-hydroperoxide. Reaction showed a pronounced lag phase, which suggested that eLOX3 is deficient in its activation step. Indeed, we found that high concentrations of hydroperoxide activator (e.g. 65 μM) overcame a prolonged lag phase (>1 h) and unveiled a dioxygenase activity with arachidonic acid; the main products were the 5-, 9-, and 7-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs). These were R/S mixtures (ranging from ∼50:50 to 73:27), and as the bis-allylic 7-HPETE can be formed only inside the enzyme active site, the results indicate there is oxygen availability along either face of the reacting fatty acid radical. That the active site oxygen supply is limited is implied from the need for continuous re-activation, as carbon radical leakage leaves the enzyme in the unactivated ferrous state. An Ala-to-Gly mutation, known to affect the positioning of O(2) in the active site of other lipoxygenase enzymes, led to more readily activated reaction and a significant increase in the 9R- over the 5-HPETE. Activation and cycling of the ferric enzyme are thus promoted using the 9E,11Z,14Z-20:3ω6 substrate, by continuous hydroperoxide activation, or by the Ala-to-Gly mutation. We suggest that eLOX3 represents one end of a spectrum among lipoxygenases where activation is inefficient, favoring hydroperoxide isomerase cycling, with the opposite end represented by readily activated enzymes in which dioxygenase activity is prominent."

The aspartyl protease activity of γ-secretase mediates regulated intramembrane proteolysis of several type I membrane proteins in addition to APP, including APP homologs, Notch receptor, ErB4, DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), low density lipoprotein receptor protein, CD44, syndecan 3, N- and E-cadherin, etc. (reviewed in Ref. 26Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Without exception, γ-secretase cleavage is preceded by ectodomain shedding of these proteins by ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) proteases or β-secretase. Although the exact intramembrane cleavage site(s) in each substrate have not been mapped, many substrates appear to undergo γ-secretase-dependent proteolysis at least at two distinct sites, termed γ- and ϵ-sites. For example, γ-secretase cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragment at the γ- and ϵ-sites generates Aβ and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), respectively. Whereas Aβ is released into the extracellular milieu, AICD forms a transcriptionally active complex with the nuclear adaptor protein Fe65 and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 (27Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In the case of Notch, γ-secretase-mediated ϵ-cleavage results in the release of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (28De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar), which translocates into the nucleus to mediate Notch signaling by transcriptional activation. Intracellular domains released from substrates such as syndecan 3 and E-cadherin do not have an obvious role in nuclear signaling and are likely destined for degradation (26Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Previously we reported that experimental deletion of TM1, TM2, and the intervening loop (Val82–Tyr154) results in the loss of PS1 endoproteolysis and impaired γ-secretase activity (29Leem J.Y. Saura C.A. Pietrzik C. Christianson J. Wanamaker C. King L.T. Veselits M.L. Tomita T. Gasparini L. Iwatsubo T. Xu H. Green W.N. Koo E.H. Thinakaran G. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 11: 64-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). More than 25% of PSEN1 mutations (47 of the 178 gene mutations) are found within the sequences that encode this stretch of 73 amino acids (aa); these mutations are responsible for 24 of the ∼106 FAD-linked aa changes in PS1. In this study, we have characterized the luminal loop 1 (LL1) and TM2 domains of PS1 using insertion, deletion, and aa substitution. Our results show that both the length and specific residues of LL1 and residues near the C terminus of TM2 are important for PS1 endoproteolysis. However, there is no correlation between PS1 endoproteolysis and the ability of experimental mutants to assemble into γ-secretase complexes or bind to three γ-secretase substrates (APP, Notch, and N-cadherin). The characterization of substrate processing reveals interesting differences in the extent to which each substrate is processed, revealing the critical involvement of PS1 residues within the LL1 and TM2 domains in substrate catalysis or the coordination between the substrate docking site and the catalytic site. The cDNA fragments encoding PS1 mutants were generated as Asp718 and PflMI fragments by two-step PCR mutagenesis and cloned by exchanging the corresponding segment in human WT PS1 expression plasmid. The cDNA encoding PS1 TM4-NF to YI mutant (a gift from Dr. Seong-Hun Kim, University of Florida) was used as template to generate TM2-aa6/15-TM4YI. The resulting cDNAs were subcloned into pMXs retroviral vector (generously provided by Dr. Toshio Kitamura, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Similarly, cDNAs encoding APPSwe, NotchΔEMV-6myc (a gift from Dr. Raphael Kopan, Washington University) and C99–6myc (a gift from Dr. Alison Goate, Washington University) were subcloned into pMXs vector. PS1−/−/PS2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were a gift from Drs. Wim Annaert and Bart De Strooper (KULeuven and Flanders Interuniversitary Institute for Biotechnology, Belgium). MEF and 293T-derived Plat-E retroviral packaging cells (30Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. For retroviral gene expression, Plat-E cells were transfected with pMXs plasmids, and supernatants containing retroviruses collected between 24 and 48 h after transfection were used to infect PS1−/−/PS2−/− MEF in the presence of 10 μg/ml polybrene. Stably transduced PS1−/−/PS2−/− MEF pools were selected in 5 μg/ml puromycin for 2 weeks and used as stable pools. For transient expression, cells infected with APP, C99, and Notch retroviruses were lysed for 48 h after infection. To prepare detergent lysates, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% SDS, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (1:200; Sigma) and briefly sonicated. For co-immunoprecipitation analyses, the cells were lysed in CHAPSO buffer (1% CHAPSO, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and aliquots of the supernatants (corresponding to 500 μg of protein) were adjusted to 500 μl with CHAPSO buffer and precleared by incubating with protein A beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Three μl of αPS1Loop or PS1NT antiserum was added to each sample and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Immune complexes were bound by incubating with 40 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C, and washed twice with 700 μl of CHAPSO buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting along with an aliquot of the input lysate. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PS1 (αPS1Loop and PS1NT) and PEN2 (PNT2), APH1aL (A1tag), and APP (CTM1) have been described (31Vetrivel K.S. Cheng H. Kim S.H. Chen Y. Barnes N.Y. Parent A.T.

Antibodies against Myc epitope (9E10; ATCC), N-cadherin (BD Transduction Laboratories), and nicastrin (Santa Cruz) were purchased. GRP78 antibody was generated in guinea pig against the synthetic peptide QPIISKLYGSGGPPPTGEEDTSEKDEL. The blots were developed using protein A-HRP (Sigma) followed by chemiluminescence detection or using IRDye800-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by Odyssey infrared imaging (LI-COR). Fresh medium was added to cells 24 h after infection with APPSwe retrovirus, and conditioned media were collected at 48 h. The levels of secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 were quantified using sandwich ELISAs as described previously (33Vetrivel K.S. Gong P. Bowen J.W. Cheng H. Chen Y. Carter M. Nguyen P.D. Placanica L. Wieland F.T. Li Y.M. Kounnas M.Z. Thinakaran G. Mol. Neurodegener. 2007; 2: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with the appropriate capture mAb (B113 for Aβ40 and A387 for Aβ42). Following incubation with culture supernatants, the plates were washed, and Aβ40 or Aβ42 was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mAb B436 (which reacts with the N-terminal region of Aβ) and CSPD-Sapphire II Luminescence Substrate (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was assayed in duplicate using appropriate dilution of the conditioned medium so that the relative luminescent units were in the linear range of the standards included on each plate. Synthetic Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides were diluted in culture medium to generate a standard curve. Previously, we and others reported that the segment encompassing the first two TMs of PS1 is important for both PS1 endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity (29Leem J.Y. Saura C.A. Pietrzik C. Christianson J. Wanamaker C. King L.T. Veselits M.L. Tomita T. Gasparini L. Iwatsubo T. Xu H. Green W.N. Koo E.H. Thinakaran G. Neurobiol.

To further characterize the role of the luminal loop connecting the first two TMs (LL1; corresponding to Lys101–Ser132) for PS1 function, we generated a series of mutants within the LL1 domain including an insertion mutant, deletion mutants, and alanine substitutions (Fig. 1). Each mutant was stably expressed in PS1−/−/PS2−/− MEF to examine PS1 endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity. LL1Ins is a mutant where we inserted 12 unrelated aa between Lys109 and Asp110 to disrupt the contiguity of the LL1 sequence. This sequence modification did not affect PS1 endoproteolysis, which suggests that the LL1 domain can be interrupted at this position (Fig. 2A). We then replaced the sequences on either side of the insertion in the LL1Ins mutant. In MutA, the first 9 aa of LL1 (Lys101–Lys109) was replaced with 8 aa (corresponding to residues 400–407 of PS1); in MutB, the last 23 aa of LL1 (Asp110–Ser132) were replaced with the same 8 aa as in MutA. The presence of the LL1Ins sequence aids in keeping the length of the LL1 in the mutants close to that of the LL1 of WT PS1. Cells stably expressing MutA and MutB still generated NTF and CTF, although the steady-state levels were somewhat lower in MutA and markedly lower in MutB relative to cells expressing WT PS1 or LL1Ins (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). When the entire LL1 was replaced with the 8-aa sequence, endoproteolysis of the resulting 8aaLL1 mutant was also markedly impaired. This defect was only partially restored when the length of LL1 was increased to 16 aa (Fig. 2A). Despite similar or even higher levels of holoPS1 expression, lower levels of NTF and CTF accumulation are readily apparent when MutA, MutB, 8aaLL1, and 16aaLL1 are compared with LL1Ins.FIGURE 2Characterization of γ-secretase complex formation by PS1 LL1 variants. A and B, PS1−/−/PS2−/− MEF were stably transduced with recombinant retroviruses expressing the indicated mutants, and the cell lysates were subject to immunoblotting using antibodies against PS1 NTF, PS1 CTF, nicastrin, APH1aL, and PEN2.

An aliquot of the input lysate was also analyzed in parallel. The blots were sequentially probed with antibodies against each γ-secretase subunit (PS1NT, αPS1Loop, nicastrin, APH1aL, and PEN2). The asterisks indicate nonspecific reactivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we designed additional mutants to determine the subdomains in LL1 that are important for PS1 processing. Because the levels of NTF and CTF were markedly lower in MutB cells as compared with Wt or MutA cells, we focused our attention on the residues (aa 10–32 of LL1) that were deleted in this mutant. We first subdivided this region into three segments: aa 10–18, 19–27, and 28–32, and replaced all of the aa within each segment with alanine. As shown in Fig. 2B, PS1 endoproteolysis was impaired to different extents in the 10/18Ala and 19/27Ala mutants but not in the 28/32Ala mutant. The last mutant we made in this region is 13/18Ala, which is endoproteolytically processed with efficiency similar to that of WT PS1. Together, these studies show that the length of the LL1 domain and specific residues within this region (110DGQ and 119TEDTETVGQ of human PS1) are important for PS1 endoproteolysis. As previously reported (35Herreman A. Van Gassen G. Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Craessaerts K. Mueller U. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), nicastrin fails to undergo maturation by complex glycosylation and remains as core-glycosylated immature nicastrin in PS1−/−/PS2−/− MEF (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the steady-state levels of PEN2 are markedly diminished in PS1−/−/PS2−/− MEF. Stable expression of WT PS1 in PS1−/−/PS2−/− cells results in nicastrin maturation and restores PEN2 levels. Similarly, stable expression of each PS1 mutant described above restored the deficiency in nicastrin maturation and increased the steady-state levels of PEN2, comparable with that found in cells expressing WT PS1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, the rescue of nicastrin maturation and PEN2 levels did not correlate with the lower steady-state levels of endoproteolyzed PS1 derivatives in cells expressing MutB, 8aaLL1, 16aaLL1, 10/18Ala, and 19/27Ala (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistent with previous reports (36Nyabi O. Bentahir M. Horré K. Herreman A. Gottardi-Littell N. Van Broeckhoven C. Merchiers P. Spittaels K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2004; 89: 1520-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the steady-state level of APH1aL was not markedly altered by the loss of PS expression or stable expression of WT or mutant PS1 in PS1−/−/PS2−/− MEF (Fig. 2A). To test our prediction that rescue of nicastrin maturation and steady-state PEN2 levels are indications of their successful assembly into γ-secretase complex, we lysed cells in 1% CHAPSO and co-immunoprecipitated PS1 LL1 mutant polypeptides and bound proteins using PS1NT and PS1Loop antibodies. PS1Loop or PS1NT immunoprecipitates and aliquots of the input lysates were analyzed by immunoblots. Regardless of whether the protein underwent endoproteolysis or not, PS1 mutants formed complexes with endogenous nicastrin, PEN2, and APH1 (Fig. 2C). These results are in agreement with the findings that sequences within the TM4 domain of PS1 bind to PEN2, and PS1 CTF binds to NCT (39Watanabe N. Tomita T. Sato C. Kitamura T. Morohashi Y.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4738-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that the reduced ability of certain PS1 mutants to generate NTF and CTF by endoproteolysis does not influence their successful association with other γ-secretase subunits to form a protein complex. Having shown that PS1 LL1 mutants form complexes with other γ-secretase subunits, we turned our attention to γ-secretase processing of substrates. We initially examined intramembranous proteolysis of APP with two approaches. First, we transiently expressed human APP695 harboring the “Swedish” double mutation (APPSwe) in stable PS1−/−/PS2−/− pools expressing PS1 LL1 variants described above. We performed Western blots to confirm comparable expression of full-length APP and to determine the levels of APP CTFs in the cell lysates and measured the levels of secreted Aβ40 in the conditioned medium by ELISA. PS1−/−/PS2−/− cells accumulate high levels of APP CTFs and fail to secrete detectible levels of Aβ40. Restoration of γ-secretase activity in PS1−/−/PS2−/− cells by stable expression of WT PS1 results in processing of CTFs, which fall below the level of detection, and secretion of Aβ40 (Fig. 3A). Insertion of 12 aa within LL1 did not affect γ-secretase processing of APP. However, there was a marked loss of γ-secretase processing of APP when the residues on either side of the insertion (MutA and MutB) or the entire LL1 (8aaLL1 and 16aaLL1) were replaced. We considered the possibility that the presence of the residues NTT in these four mutants might have resulted in N-glycosylation within the LL1 region, contributing to a loss of γ-secretase activity. However, treatment of MEF with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, did not alter the electrophoretic migration of these PS1 mutants but clearly altered that of the N-glycosylated transmembrane protein CD147 by generating a faster migrating nonglycosylated form (supplemental Fig. S1B). Alanine substitution mutants with the exception of 28/32Ala exhibited varying degrees of partial loss of γ-secretase processing of APP (Fig. 3A). In the second approach, we transiently expressed APP C99–6myc and assessed the levels AICD generated by γ-secretase cleavage of C99 between Leu49 and Val50, which is referred to as the ϵ-cleavage (42Weidemann A.

As expected, PS1−/−/PS2−/− MEF fail to generate AICD, but γ-secretase cleavage of C99–6myc releases readily detectible levels of AICD in stably infected PS1−/−/PS2−/− MEF expressing WT PS1 (Fig. 3B, top panel).

https://openalex.org/W2083064598,"The Neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2) tumor suppressor merlin negatively regulates cell proliferation in numerous cell types. We have previously shown that the NF2 protein (merlin/schwannomin) associates with mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase that is required for the proliferation of normal and neoplastic cells. In this study, we show that merlin inhibits MLK3 activity, as well as the activation of its downstream effectors, B-Raf, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The ability of merlin to regulate MLK3 activity requires a direct association between MLK3 and residues in the C-terminal region of merlin. Merlin integrates Rho GTPase family signaling with MAPK activity by inhibiting the binding between MLK3 and its upstream activator, Cdc42. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MLK3 is required for merlin-mediated suppression of cell proliferation and invasion. Collectively, these results establish merlin as a potent inhibitor of MLK3, ERK and JNK activation in cancer, and provide a mechanistic link between deregulated MAPK and Rho GTPase signaling in NF2 growth control."

In this study, the effect of loss of RECK function was assessed in various ways and cell systems. Successive cell cultivation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) according to 3T3 protocol revealed that the germline knockout of RECK confers accelerated cell proliferation and early escape from cellular senescence associated with downregulation of p19(Arf), Trp53 and p21(Cdkn1a). In contrast, short hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of RECK induced irreversible growth arrest along with several features of the Arf, Trp53 and Cdkn1a-dependent cellular senescence. Within 2 days of RECK depletion, we observed a transient increase in protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation associated with an upregulated expression of cyclin D1, p19(Arf), Trp53, p21(Cdkn1a) and Sprouty 2. On further cultivation, RAS, AKT and ERK activities were then downregulated to a level lower than control, indicating that RECK depletion leads to a negative feedback to RAS signaling and subsequent cellular senescence. In addition, we observed that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity was transiently upregulated by RECK depletion in MEFs, and continuously downregulated by RECK overexpression in colon cancer cells. These findings indicate that RECK is a novel modulator of EGFR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2027284981,"Dysbindin-1 is a 50-kDa coiled-coil-containing protein encoded by the gene DTNBP1 (dystrobrevin-binding protein 1), a candidate genetic factor for schizophrenia. Genetic variations in this gene confer a susceptibility to schizophrenia through a decreased expression of dysbindin-1. It was reported that dysbindin-1 regulates the expression of presynaptic proteins and the release of neurotransmitters. However, the precise functions of dysbindin-1 are largely unknown. Here, we show that dysbindin-1 is a novel nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and translocated to the nucleus upon treatment with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of exportin-1/CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Dysbindin-1 harbors a functional nuclear export signal necessary for its nuclear export, and the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of dysbindin-1 affects its regulation of synapsin I expression. In brains of sandy mice, a dysbindin-1-null strain that displays abnormal behaviors related to schizophrenia, the protein and mRNA levels of synapsin I are decreased. These findings demonstrate that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of dysbindin-1 regulates synapsin I expression and thus may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W1994649465,"INT6/EIF3E has been implicated in breast tumorigenesis, but its functional activities remain poorly defined. We found that, repressing INT6 expression induced transformed properties in normal human mammary epithelium (MCF10A); in contrast, Int6 silencing induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. As in fission yeast, Int6 in human cells was required for assembly of active proteasomes. A reverse-phase protein array screen identified SRC3/AIB1 as one oncoprotein the level and stability of which increased when Int6 was silenced in MCF10A cells. Our data further show that Int6 binds SRC3 and its ubiquitin ligase Fbw7, thus perhaps mediating the interaction between SRC3–Fbw7 and proteasomes. Consistent with this, Int6 silencing did not increase SRC3 levels in HeLa cells, which have low Fbw7 levels. It is surprising that, however, polyubiquitylated proteins do not accumulate or may even decrease in Int6-silenced cells that contain defective proteasomes. Considering that decreased ubiquitin might explain this observation and that Int6 might control ubiquitin levels in its role as a subunit of eIF3 (eukaryote translation initiation factor 3), we found that silencing Int6 reduced monoubiquitin protein levels, which correlated with a shift of ubiquitin mRNAs from larger polysomes to non-translating ribosomes. In contrast, levels of many housekeeping proteins did not change. This apparent reduction in the translation of ubiquitin genes correlated with a modest reduction in protein synthesis rate and formation of large polysomes. To further determine whether Int6 can selectively control translation, we analyzed translation of different 5′-untranslated region reporters and found that indeed, loss of Int6 had differential effects on these reporters. Together the data suggest that Int6 depletion blocks ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis by decreasing both ubiquitin levels and the assembly of functional proteasome machinery, leading to accumulation of oncoproteins, such as SRC3 that can transform mammary epithelium. Our data also raise the possibility that Int6 can further fine-tune protein levels by selectively controlling translation of specific mRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2000341993,"A lysine residue within the highly conserved center of the fifth transmembrane segment in PIIC-type ATPase α-subunits is uniquely found in H,K-ATPases instead of a serine in all Na,K-ATPase isoforms. Because previous studies suggested a prominent role of this residue in determining the electrogenicity of non-gastric H,K-ATPase and in pKa modulation of the proton-translocating residues in the gastric H,K-ATPases as well, we investigated its functional significance for ion transport by expressing several Lys-791 variants of the gastric H,K-ATPase in Xenopus oocytes. Although the mutant proteins were all detected at the cell surface, none of the investigated mutants displayed any measurable K+-induced stationary currents. In Rb+ uptake measurements, replacement of Lys-791 by Arg, Ala, Ser, and Glu substantially impaired transport activity and reduced the sensitivity toward the E2-specific inhibitor SCH28080. Furthermore, voltage clamp fluorometry using a reporter site in the TM5/TM6 loop for labeling with tetra-methylrhodamine-6-maleimide revealed markedly changed fluorescence signals. All four investigated mutants exhibited a strong shift toward the E1P state, in agreement with their reduced SCH28080 sensitivity, and an about 5–10-fold decreased forward rate constant of the E1P ↔ E2P conformational transition, thus explaining the E1P shift and the reduced Rb+ transport activity. When Glu-820 in TM6 adjacent to Lys-791 was replaced by non-charged or positively charged amino acids, severe effects on fluorescence signals and Rb+ transport were also observed, whereas substitution by aspartate was less disturbing. These results suggest that formation of an E2P-stabilizing interhelical salt bridge is essential to prevent futile proton exchange cycles of H+ pumping P-type ATPases. A lysine residue within the highly conserved center of the fifth transmembrane segment in PIIC-type ATPase α-subunits is uniquely found in H,K-ATPases instead of a serine in all Na,K-ATPase isoforms. Because previous studies suggested a prominent role of this residue in determining the electrogenicity of non-gastric H,K-ATPase and in pKa modulation of the proton-translocating residues in the gastric H,K-ATPases as well, we investigated its functional significance for ion transport by expressing several Lys-791 variants of the gastric H,K-ATPase in Xenopus oocytes. Although the mutant proteins were all detected at the cell surface, none of the investigated mutants displayed any measurable K+-induced stationary currents. In Rb+ uptake measurements, replacement of Lys-791 by Arg, Ala, Ser, and Glu substantially impaired transport activity and reduced the sensitivity toward the E2-specific inhibitor SCH28080. Furthermore, voltage clamp fluorometry using a reporter site in the TM5/TM6 loop for labeling with tetra-methylrhodamine-6-maleimide revealed markedly changed fluorescence signals. All four investigated mutants exhibited a strong shift toward the E1P state, in agreement with their reduced SCH28080 sensitivity, and an about 5–10-fold decreased forward rate constant of the E1P ↔ E2P conformational transition, thus explaining the E1P shift and the reduced Rb+ transport activity. When Glu-820 in TM6 adjacent to Lys-791 was replaced by non-charged or positively charged amino acids, severe effects on fluorescence signals and Rb+ transport were also observed, whereas substitution by aspartate was less disturbing. These results suggest that formation of an E2P-stabilizing interhelical salt bridge is essential to prevent futile proton exchange cycles of H+ pumping P-type ATPases. The ubiquitous Na,K-ATPase and the gastric H,K-ATPase belong to the PIIC subgroup of the extensive class of P-type ATPases, which use ATP hydrolysis for active transport of cations. The reversible phosphorylation of a highly conserved Asp residue, a hallmark of all P-type ATPases, is coupled to the transition between two principal conformational states (E1 and E2) and the corresponding phosphointermediates (E1P and E2P). Na,K- and H,K-ATPases share several similarities. The catalytic α-subunits are highly homologous (∼60% sequence identity), whereas the accessory β-subunits have lower sequence identity but nevertheless share similar basic structural features (1Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Na,K- and H,K-ATPases are the only known K+-countertransporting P-type pumps in eukaryotes. Despite these common features, there are also important differences between the two enzymes. For example, the asymmetrical transport stoichiometry of Na+ and K+ exchange (3 versus 2) by all known Na,K-ATPase isoforms results in a net electrogenic transport (2Thomas R.C. J. Physiol. 1969; 201: 495-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whereas gastric and non-gastric H,K-ATPases operate strictly electroneutral with 2:2 (or 1:1) stoichiometry (3Sachs G. Chang H.H. Rabon E. Schackman R. Lewin M. Saccomani G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7690-7698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Burnay M. Crambert G. Kharoubi-Hess S. Geering K. Horisberger J.D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2001; 281: F869-F874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the transport cycle of the H,K-ATPase is net electroneutral, evidence has been accumulated that several partial reactions of the cycle are electrogenic. Electrophysiological experiments using purified H,K-ATPase-containing membrane fragments on planar lipid bilayers (5van der Hijden H.T. Grell E. de Pont J.J. Bamberg E. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 114: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Stengelin M. Fendler K. Bamberg E. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 132: 211-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have shown that the proton branch of the cycle, which involves the E1P-E2P conformational change investigated in the current study, includes an electrogenic step. As it is the case for the electrogenic Na,K-ATPase, the E1P-E2P distribution might be driven by the redistribution of cations within intra- or extracellularly oriented high-field access channels to the transport sites. The electrogenicity during the H+ branch of the cycle is most likely counterbalanced by another partial reaction of reversed electrogenicity in the K+ branch to bring about net electroneutrality (7Lorentzon P. Sachs G. Wallmark B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10705-10710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, mutagenesis studies have shown that Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase extrude Na+ and H+ (or H3O+), generally utilizing the same conserved carboxylic acids of their respective cation binding sites in the transmembrane domains TM4 2The abbreviations used are: TMtransmembrane domainTMRMtetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimideVCFvoltage clamp fluorometry. to TM6 (see Fig. 1). This raises not only the important question of how the different stoichiometries are achieved on a molecular level but also why these carboxyls with an expected pK around 3–5 can release protons at a lumenal pH of ∼1 in the case of the gastric H,K-ATPase. Finally, a remarkable particularity of the gastric H,K-ATPase (and also some other P-type proton pumps like the plant/fungal H+-ATPase) is its inability to run backward and synthesize ATP (8Helmich-de Jong M.L. van Emst-de Vries S.E.

Notably, all these unique H,K-ATPase properties have been linked to the presence of a lysine residue in the fifth transmembrane segment of the catalytic α-subunit (Lys-791 in gastric H,K-ATPase (shown in blue in Fig. 1 and in the sequence alignments in Fig. 9). This lysine in the otherwise highly conserved (K/S)NIPEIT sequence motif is replaced by an uncharged serine in Na,K-ATPases (see P-type ATPase alignments in Fig. 9). Remarkably, it is the only positively charged amino acid in the whole TM region of the H,K-ATPase α-subunit. Homology modeling of the cation binding pocket based on the SERCA (sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase) structure in the E2-state together with mutagenesis studies have predicted an E2-conformation-specific salt bridge between the side chains of Lys-791 (in TM5) and Glu-820 (in TM6, highlighted in brown in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9) of the cation binding pocket (21Koenderink J.B.

Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations by Munson et al. (22Munson K. Garcia R. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5267-5284Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have shown that the positively charged side chain of Lys-791 probably reorients during the E1P ↔ E2P transition as a consequence of a change in the relative positions of the TM5 and TM6 helices. The reorientation may move the NH3+ group of the side chain closer to the plane of the ion binding site in E2P (Fig. 1), thereby lowering the effective pKa of the putative H3O+-coordinating carboxylates. This change in pKa could enable proton release at low lumenal pH (22Munson K. Garcia R. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5267-5284Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Shin J.M. Munson K.

Upon mutation of the corresponding Lys-800 to Ala or Glu, the normally electroneutral Na+/K+ exchange of wild-type toad bladder H,K-ATPase (sometimes also termed X,K-ATPase to differentiate it from the “gastric” H,K-ATPase) becomes electrogenic, thus, generating positive pump currents in the presence of extracellular K+. Vice versa, a charge-introducing mutation of the respective serine to a positively charged arginine in toad Na,K-ATPase resulted in a loss of pump currents with minor effects on Rb+ transport activity (24Burnay M.

However, the interpretation of these ion transport studies on the non-gastric H,K-ATPase was complicated by the fact that both Na+ and H+ ions are transported in exchange for K+ and that the H+(Na+)/K+ transport stoichiometry is not known. Because the non-gastric H,K-ATPase is more similar to Na,K-ATPases in terms of transported ions (25Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. Rossier B.C. Jaisser F. J. Biol.

These limitations prompted us to investigate the functional relevance of Lys-791 for electroneutral transport of a bona fide H+-transporting H,K-ATPase, the rat gastric H,K-ATPase expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We took advantage of a variant gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit with a single cysteine replacement S806C in the extracellular TM5/TM6 loop (see Fig. 1) that enabled us to study several Lys-791 mutants also by voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF) upon site-specific labeling with tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide (TMRM), as described previously (30Dürr K.L.

In addition to the information regarding steady-state transport, which was provided by Rb+ uptake measurements, this method allows the study of voltage-dependent conformational changes under presteady-state conditions. Moreover, VCF not only reveals the voltage-dependent distribution between E1P/E2P states but also the kinetics of the E1P ↔ E2P conformational transition. The cDNAs of the rat gastric H,K-ATPase β-subunit and a modified form of the α-subunit with a single cysteine replacement in the TM5/TM6 extracellular loop (S806C, see Fig. 1) were subcloned into vector pTLN (33Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This cysteine replacement is homologous to the N790C mutation in the TM5/TM6 loop of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit (34Geibel S. Zimmermann D. Zifarelli G. Becker A. Koenderink J.B. Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H.

It has been shown previously that the S806C mutation enables site-specific labeling of H,K-ATPase with the environmentally sensitive fluorophore TMRM, and rubidium uptake measurements confirmed that the αS806C mutation did not affect the transport properties of gastric H,K-ATPase (32Dürr K.L. Tavraz N.N. Zimmermann D. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4288-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Additional amino acid replacements at positions Lys-791 and Glu-820 were introduced into the αS806C reference construct (which is referred as “wild-type” or WT throughout the current study) using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) and verified by DNA sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon). Xenopus oocytes were obtained by collagenase treatment after partial ovarectomy from Xenopus laevis females. cRNAs were prepared using the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Applied Biosystems). A 50-nl aliquot containing 20–25 ng of H,K-ATPase α-subunit cRNA and 5 ng of H,K-ATPase β-subunit was injected into each cell. After injection, oocytes were kept in ORI buffer (110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 50 mg/liter gentamycin at 18 °C for 2 days. Before all experiments, which were usually carried out 2–3 days after injection at 21–24 °C, oocytes were preincubated in solutions containing 100 μm ouabain (Sigma) to inhibit the endogenous Xenopus Na,K-ATPase. Oocytes were incubated for 15 min in Rb+ flux buffer (5 mm RbCl, 85 mm tetramethylammonium chloride, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 10 mm MES, pH 5.5, 100 μm ouabain). After 3 washing steps in Rb+-free washing buffer (90 mm tetramethylammonium chloride or NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 10 mm MES, pH 5.5) and 1 wash in water, each individual oocyte was homogenized in 1 ml of Millipore water. For inhibition experiments, the K+-competitive inhibitor SCH28080 (Sigma) was added to the preincubation solution and Rb+ flux buffer (to final concentrations as indicated by the respective figure legends to Figs. 3, 6, and 8). For vanadate inhibition experiments, the respective oocytes were injected with 50 nl of a solution containing 100 mm sodium orthovanadate (buffered with 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.4) ∼30–40 min before Rb+ uptake measurements. Assuming an oocyte volume of about 1 μl, this corresponds to a final intracellular concentration of ∼5 mm. Whereas the inhibitor vanadate interacts specifically"

However, only when its negative phosphoseryl clusters remained free, i.e. when it adsorbed onto a negative surface, could calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoclusters bind to the casein molecules. Once the CaP clusters were in place, step-by-step building of multilayered casein architectures became possible. The presence of CaP was essential; neither Ca(2+) nor phosphate could alone facilitate casein aggregation. Thus, it seems that CaP is the organizing motive in the casein micelle formation. Atomic force microscopy revealed that even a single adsorbed casein layer was composed of very small (in the range of tens of nanometers) spherical forms. The stiffness of the adsorbed casein layer largely increased in the presence of CaP. On this basis, we can imagine that casein micelles emerge according to the following scheme. The amphipathic casein monomers aggregate into oligomers via hydrophobic interactions even in the absence of CaP. Full scale, CaP-carrying micelles could materialize by interlocking these casein oligomers with CaP nanoclusters. Such a mechanism would not contradict former experimental results and could offer a synthesis between the submicelle and the block copolymer models of casein micelles."
