https://openalex.org/W4220778713,"Protein aggregation is a hallmark of multiple human pathologies. Autophagy selectively degrades protein aggregates via aggrephagy. How selectivity is achieved has been elusive. Here, we identify the chaperonin subunit CCT2 as an autophagy receptor regulating the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins in the cell and the mouse brain. CCT2 associates with aggregation-prone proteins independent of cargo ubiquitination and interacts with autophagosome marker ATG8s through a non-classical VLIR motif. In addition, CCT2 regulates aggrephagy independently of the ubiquitin-binding receptors (P62, NBR1, and TAX1BP1) or chaperone-mediated autophagy. Unlike P62, NBR1, and TAX1BP1, which facilitate the clearance of protein condensates with liquidity, CCT2 specifically promotes the autophagic degradation of protein aggregates with little liquidity (solid aggregates). Furthermore, aggregation-prone protein accumulation induces the functional switch of CCT2 from a chaperone subunit to an autophagy receptor by promoting CCT2 monomer formation, which exposes the VLIR to ATG8s interaction and, therefore, enables the autophagic function."
https://openalex.org/W4220889698,"Abstract Before the Perseverance rover landing, the acoustic environment of Mars was unknown. Models predicted that: (1) atmospheric turbulence changes at centimetre scales or smaller at the point where molecular viscosity converts kinetic energy into heat 1 , (2) the speed of sound varies at the surface with frequency 2,3 and (3) high-frequency waves are strongly attenuated with distance in CO 2 (refs. 2–4 ). However, theoretical models were uncertain because of a lack of experimental data at low pressure and the difficulty to characterize turbulence or attenuation in a closed environment. Here, using Perseverance microphone recordings, we present the first characterization of the acoustic environment on Mars and pressure fluctuations in the audible range and beyond, from 20 Hz to 50 kHz. We find that atmospheric sounds extend measurements of pressure variations down to 1,000 times smaller scales than ever observed before, showing a dissipative regime extending over five orders of magnitude in energy. Using point sources of sound (Ingenuity rotorcraft, laser-induced sparks), we highlight two distinct values for the speed of sound that are about 10 m s −1 apart below and above 240 Hz, a unique characteristic of low-pressure CO 2 -dominated atmosphere. We also provide the acoustic attenuation with distance above 2 kHz, allowing us to explain the large contribution of the CO 2 vibrational relaxation in the audible range. These results establish a ground truth for the modelling of acoustic processes, which is critical for studies in atmospheres such as those of Mars and Venus."
https://openalex.org/W4220722406,"The liver vascular network is patterned by sinusoidal and hepatocyte co-zonation. How intra-liver vessels acquire their hierarchical specialized functions is unknown. We study heterogeneity of hepatic vascular cells during mouse development through functional and single-cell RNA-sequencing. The acquisition of sinusoidal endothelial cell identity is initiated during early development and completed postnatally, originating from a pool of undifferentiated vascular progenitors at E12. The peri-natal induction of the transcription factor c-Maf is a critical switch for the sinusoidal identity determination. Endothelium-restricted deletion of c-Maf disrupts liver sinusoidal development, aberrantly expands postnatal liver hematopoiesis, promotes excessive postnatal sinusoidal proliferation, and aggravates liver pro-fibrotic sensitivity to chemical insult. Enforced c-Maf overexpression in generic human endothelial cells switches on a liver sinusoidal transcriptional program that maintains hepatocyte function. c-Maf represents an inducible intra-organotypic and niche-responsive molecular determinant of hepatic sinusoidal cell identity and lays the foundation for the strategies for vasculature-driven liver repair."
https://openalex.org/W4220683471,"Recent genome-wide association and transcriptome-wide association studies have identified an association between the PALMD locus, encoding palmdelphin, a protein involved in myoblast differentiation, and calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Nevertheless, the function and underlying mechanisms of PALMD in CAVD remain unclear. We herein investigated whether and how PALMD affects the pathogenesis of CAVD using clinical samples from CAVD patients and a human valve interstitial cell (hVIC) in vitro calcification model. We showed that PALMD was upregulated in calcified regions of human aortic valves and calcified hVICs. Furthermore, silencing of PALMD reduced hVIC in vitro calcification, osteogenic differentiation, and apoptosis, whereas overexpression of PALMD had the opposite effect. RNA-Seq of PALMD-depleted hVICs revealed that silencing of PALMD reduced glycolysis and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated inflammation in hVICs and attenuated tumor necrosis factor α-induced monocyte adhesion to hVICs. Having established the role of PALMD in hVIC glycolysis, we examined whether glycolysis itself could regulate hVIC osteogenic differentiation and inflammation. Intriguingly, the inhibition of PFKFB3-mediated glycolysis significantly attenuated osteogenic differentiation and inflammation of hVICs. However, silencing of PFKFB3 inhibited PALMD-induced hVIC inflammation, but not osteogenic differentiation. Finally, we showed that the overexpression of PALMD enhanced hVIC osteogenic differentiation and inflammation, as opposed to glycolysis, through the activation of NF-κB. The present study demonstrates that the genome-wide association- and transcriptome-wide association-identified CAVD risk gene PALMD may promote CAVD development through regulation of glycolysis and NF-κB-mediated inflammation. We propose that targeting PALMD-mediated glycolysis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treating CAVD."
https://openalex.org/W4221077803,"Small molecules encoded by biosynthetic pathways mediate cross-species interactions and harbor untapped potential, which has provided valuable compounds for medicine and biotechnology. Since studying biosynthetic gene clusters in their native context is often difficult, alternative efforts rely on heterologous expression, which is limited by host-specific metabolic capacity and regulation. Here, we describe a computational-experimental technology to redesign genes and their regulatory regions with hybrid elements for cross-species expression in Gram-negative and -positive bacteria and eukaryotes, decoupling biosynthetic capacity from host-range constraints to activate silenced pathways. These synthetic genetic elements enabled the discovery of a class of microbiome-derived nucleotide metabolites-tyrocitabines-from Lactobacillus iners. Tyrocitabines feature a remarkable orthoester-phosphate, inhibit translational activity, and invoke unexpected biosynthetic machinery, including a class of ""Amadori synthases"" and ""abortive"" tRNA synthetases. Our approach establishes a general strategy for the redesign, expression, mobilization, and characterization of genetic elements in diverse organisms and communities."
https://openalex.org/W4225718860,"The cortical grasp network encodes planning and execution of grasps and processes spoken and written aspects of language. High-level cortical areas within this network are attractive implant sites for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). While a tetraplegic patient performed grasp motor imagery and vocalized speech, neural activity was recorded from the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), ventral premotor cortex (PMv), and somatosensory cortex (S1). In SMG and PMv, five imagined grasps were well represented by firing rates of neuronal populations during visual cue presentation. During motor imagery, these grasps were significantly decodable from all brain areas. During speech production, SMG encoded both spoken grasp types and the names of five colors. Whereas PMv neurons significantly modulated their activity during grasping, SMG’s neural population broadly encoded features of both motor imagery and speech. Together, these results indicate that brain signals from high-level areas of the human cortex could be used for grasping and speech BMI applications."
https://openalex.org/W4221014244,"The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification, energy homeostasis, and cell proliferation by modulating the transcription of numerous target genes. CAR activation has been established as the mode of action by which phenobarbital-like nongenotoxic carcinogens promote liver tumor formation in rodents. This paradigm, however, appears to be unrelated to the function of human CAR (hCAR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which remains poorly understood. Here, we show that hCAR expression is significantly lower in HCC than that in adjacent nontumor tissues and, importantly, reduced hCAR expression is associated with a worse HCC prognosis. We also show overexpression of hCAR in human hepatoma cells (HepG2 and Hep3B) profoundly suppressed cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, soft-agar colony formation, and the growth of xenografts in nude mice. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that the expression of erythropoietin (EPO), a pleiotropic growth factor, was markedly repressed by hCAR in hepatoma cells. Addition of recombinant EPO in HepG2 cells partially rescued hCAR-suppressed cell viability. Mechanistically, we showed that overexpressing hCAR repressed mitogenic EPO-EPO receptor signaling through dephosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Furthermore, we found that hCAR downregulates EPO expression by repressing the expression and activity of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha, a key transcription factor regulating EPO expression. Collectively, our results suggest that hCAR plays a tumor suppressive role in HCC development, which differs from that of rodent CAR and offers insight into the hCAR-hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha-EPO axis in human liver tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4225777043,"Colorectal cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, warranting the urgent need for a new treatment option. Plant-derived nanovesicles containing bioactive compounds represent new therapeutic avenues due to their unique characteristics as natural nanocarriers for bioactive molecules with therapeutic effects. Recent evidence has revealed potential anticancer activity of bioactive compounds from Boesenbergia rotunda (L.) Mansf. (fingerroot). However, the effect and the underlying mechanisms of fingerroot-derived nanovesicles (FDNVs) against colorectal cancer are still unknown. We isolated the nanovesicles from fingerroot and demonstrated their anticancer activity against two colorectal cancer cell lines, HT-29 and HCT116. The IC50 values were 63.9 ± 2.4, 57.8 ± 4.1, 47.8 ± 7.6 μg/ml for HT-29 cells and 57.7 ± 6.6, 47.2 ± 5.2, 34 ± 2.9 μg/ml for HCT116 cells at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Interestingly, FDNVs were not toxic to a normal colon epithelial cell line, CCD 841 CoN. FDNVs exhibited selective uptake by the colorectal cancer cell lines but not the normal colon epithelial cell line. Moreover, dose- and time-dependent FDNV-induced apoptosis was only observed in the colorectal cancer cell lines. In addition, reactive oxygen species levels were substantially increased in colorectal cancer cells, but total glutathione decreased after treatment with FDNVs. Our results show that FDNVs exhibited selective anticancer activity in colorectal cancer cell lines via the disruption of intracellular redox homeostasis and induction of apoptosis, suggesting the utility of FDNVs as a novel intervention for colorectal cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W4221130511,"Mitochondria are fundamentally important in cell function, and their malfunction can cause the development of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neuronal disorders. Myosin 19 (Myo19) shows discrete localization with mitochondria and is thought to play an important role in mitochondrial dynamics and function; however, the function of Myo19 in mitochondrial dynamics at the cellular and molecular levels is poorly understood. Critical missing information is whether Myo19 is a processive motor that is suitable for transportation of mitochondria. Here, we show for the first time that single Myo19 molecules processively move on actin filaments and can transport mitochondria in cells. We demonstrate that Myo19 dimers having a leucine zipper processively moved on cellular actin tracks in demembraned cells with a velocity of 50 to 60 nm/s and a run length of ∼0.4 μm, similar to the movement of isolated mitochondria from Myo19 dimer-transfected cells on actin tracks, suggesting that the Myo19 dimer can transport mitochondria. Furthermore, we show single molecules of Myo19 dimers processively moved on single actin filaments with a large step size of ∼34 nm. Importantly, WT Myo19 single molecules without the leucine zipper processively move in filopodia in living cells similar to Myo19 dimers, whereas deletion of the tail domain abolished such active movement. These results suggest that Myo19 can processively move on actin filaments when two Myo19 monomers form a dimer, presumably as a result of tail-tail association. In conclusion, Myo19 molecules can directly transport mitochondria on actin tracks within living cells."
https://openalex.org/W4220729596,"Picornaviruses are small RNA viruses that hijack host cell machinery to promote their replication. During infection, these viruses express two proteases, 2Apro and 3Cpro, which process viral proteins. They also subvert a number of host functions, including innate immune responses, host protein synthesis, and intracellular transport, by utilizing poorly understood mechanisms for rapidly and specifically targeting critical host proteins. Here, we used proteomic tools to characterize 2Apro interacting partners, functions, and targeting mechanisms. Our data indicate that, initially, 2Apro primarily targets just two cellular proteins: eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4G (a critical component of the protein synthesis machinery) and Nup98 (an essential component of the nuclear pore complex, responsible for nucleocytoplasmic transport). The protease appears to employ two different cleavage mechanisms; it likely interacts with eIF3L, utilizing the eIF3 complex to proteolytically access the eIF4G protein but also directly binds and degrades Nup98. This Nup98 cleavage results in only a marginal effect on nuclear import of proteins, while nuclear export of proteins and mRNAs were more strongly affected. Collectively, our data indicate that 2Apro selectively inhibits protein translation, key nuclear export pathways, and cellular mRNA localization early in infection to benefit viral replication at the expense of particular cell functions.

Collectively, our data indicate that 2Apro selectively inhibits protein translation, key nuclear export pathways, and cellular mRNA localization early in infection to benefit viral replication at the expense of particular cell functions. Picornaviruses are small, nonenveloped RNA viruses that, like other viruses, subvert their hosts’ cellular functions to propagate (1Fan Y. Sanyal S. Bruzzone R. Breaking bad: How viruses subvert the cell cycle.Front. Cell Microbiol. 2018; 8: 396Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These functions can include host protein synthesis (2Walsh D. Mohr I. Viral subversion of the host protein synthesis machinery.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 860-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), intracellular protein and nucleic acid transport (3Yarbrough M.L. Mata M.A. Sakthivel R. Fontoura B.M. Viral subversion of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking.Traffic. 2014; 15: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and innate immune responses (4Murphy P.M. Viral exploitation and subversion of the immune system through chemokine mimicry.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The genus Enterovirus includes most of the human disease-causing picornaviruses, which are diverse and whose infections cause a variety of impactful clinical symptoms including diseases of the central nervous system leading to paralysis (poliovirus), respiratory system (rhinovirus), and heart (Coxsackievirus B3—CVB3), among many others (5Tang J.W. Holmes C.W. Acute and chronic disease caused by enteroviruses.Virulence. 2017; 8: 1062-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Further elucidating the mechanisms of picornaviral replication, and specifically how picornaviruses subvert infected cells and which host proteins are manipulated, would prove invaluable toward the development of novel treatment strategies for picornaviral infections. The picornaviral genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA that is translated by host ribosomes into a polyprotein comprising capsid and nonstructural proteins. This polyprotein is co-translationally processed into individual components by two virally encoded proteases, 2A (2Apro) and 3C (3Cpro). Protease 2Apro makes an initial cleavage during translation to separate the viral capsid proteins (VP1-4) from the remaining polyprotein (6Zell R. Picornaviridae-the ever-growing virus family.Arch. Virol. 2018; 163: 299-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), while 3Cpro makes all subsequent polyprotein cleavages to liberate individual viral proteins. Many of the translated viral proteins still have incompletely defined roles. For example, the 2A and 3C proteases have been reported to also cleave dozens of different host proteins, ranging from translation factors, RNA binding proteins, nuclear pore complex (NPC) components involved in protein and nucleic acid trafficking, innate immune proteins, and many others (7Walker E.J.

It is hypothesized that both proteases, especially 2Apro, play a critical role for promoting picornaviral replication and attenuating the host antiviral response. Given 2Apro’s potential importance in subverting host function, its cleavage targets and catalytic function have been intensively studied by virologists in several model systems and in a diverse array of picornaviruses, but the mechanism(s), temporal progression, and effects of protease activity on host protein complexes remain unclear (7Walker E.J.

Here, we pursued a biochemical and proteomic approach to explore the function of 2Apro from Coxsackievirus B3, one of the most widely studied pathogenic picornavirus species. We focused our efforts specifically on the protease, outside of an infectious context where a plethora of virally induced changes could complicate our analyses. We present evidence supporting the idea that, in the earliest stages of infection, 2Apro targets a small number of specific host targets and over the course of infection eventually broadens its target list as more viral protease accumulates through continuous polyprotein translation. We have previously developed an efficient affinity capture pipeline that is effective for a diversity of proteomic studies (14LaCava J. Fernandez-Martinez J. Hakhverdyan Z. Rout M.P.

For our proteomic studies of picornaviral 2Apro, we established stable HeLa cell lines (using the PiggyBac system), allowing expression under a doxycycline-inducible promoter of GFP-tagged forms of WT 2Apro or its catalytically inactive variant carrying a Cys-110-Ala mutation (2AproC110A) (21Atze T. Das L.T. Ben B. Tet-on systems for doxycycline-inducible gene expression.Curr. Gene Ther. 2016; 16: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The GFP tag served to facilitate detection of protease production; moreover, it allowed for efficient affinity capture of catalytically active and inactive proteases and their interacting partners. Cells expressing the GFP tag without attached protease served as an additional control in these experiments. It is well established that 2Apro shuts down host translation through eIF4G cleavage during picornaviral infections (10Zamora M. Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E.

Fuchs G. Fraser C.S. Cellular cap-binding protein, eIF4E, promotes picornavirus genome restructuring and translation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 9611-9616Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of picornavirus 2Apro also quickly depletes cellular eIF4G levels and stops host translation (25Lamphear B.J. Tim Skern R.K. Rhoads R.E. Mapping of functional domains in eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) with picornaviral proteases.J. Biol.

This translational arrest creates a situation where expression of 2Apro also ceases, thereby limiting its detectable accumulation in these cells. Therefore, we used the cleavage of 2Apro targets as a proxy to assay the expression of WT 2Apro. Among the reported substrates of 2Apro (see also below) are Nup98 and eIF4G, which were indeed rapidly depleted following doxycycline treatment of HeLa cells expressing GFP-2Apro, but as expected not those expressing GFP or GFP-2Apro C110A (Figs. S1 and S2) (27Park N. Katikaneni P. Skern T. Gustin K.E. Differential targeting of nuclear pore complex proteins in poliovirus-infected cells.J.

Having confirmed the expression of our constructs, we grew the doxycycline-treated cells to preparative quantities and subjected them to cryogenic lysis, producing homogenous cell powders that can be stably stored long term and can be weighed out into tubes for affinity capture experiments (16LaCava J. Jiang H. Rout M.P. Protein complex affinity capture from cryomilled mammalian cells.J. Vis. Exp. 2016; 118: 54518Google Scholar), providing consistency across experiments. We then affinity captured the GFP-tagged proteases from these lysates, together with associating proteins (Fig. 1B). GFP-2AproC110A was successfully affinity captured with significantly more interacting proteins than the GFP control or GFP-2Apro, as visualized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S3). Notably, we were able to affinity capture WT GFP-2Apro, although the protein levels were considerably lower than for GFP or GFP-2AproC110A. This is expected, since host proteins that are cleaved by 2Apro are degraded and no longer available for co-purification; moreover, WT 2Apro activity shuts down host translation, preventing replenishment of targeted proteins. However, in the absence of protease cleavage and subsequent product release, intermediate complexes consisting of substrate bound to the inactive protease may be stabilized. For these reasons, we focused our affinity capture efforts on GFP-2AproC110A to better reveal the protease binding partners and cleavage targets. We analyzed affinity capture eluates by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry (MS) (Figs. 1C, 2A, S4 and Table S1). We ranked proteins in the GFP-2AproC110A affinity capture dataset by protein abundance and compared fold enrichments of proteins found in both 2Apro and 2AproC110A datasets compared to the GFP control (Fig. S5). We plotted the top ∼40 interacting proteins by label-free protein abundance determination (Fig. 1B). Identified proteins were broken down into three categories: Nups (red), translation initiation factors (purple), and cytoskeletal and other proteins (gray), the latter being mainly composed of residual contaminants (29Mellacheruvu D. Wright Z. Couzens A.L. Lambert J.P. St-Denis N.A. Li T. Miteva Y.V. Hauri S. Sardiu M.E. Low T.Y. Halim V.A. Bagshaw R.D. Hubner N.C. Al-Hakim A. Bouchard A. et al.The CRAPome: A contaminant repository for affinity purification-mass spectrometry data.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The top groups of interacting proteins were dominated by Nup98-Rae1 and almost the entire eIF3 complex. Nup98 and Rae1 were detected with an approximately 1-to-1 protein stoichiometric ratio, based on label-free MS quantitation. Given these data, it is likely that 2AproC110A is binding one of these two proteins during affinity capture. Since Nup98 is a known cleavage target (30Guntas G. Hallett R.A. Zimmerman S.P.

Rae1 is well characterized as a shuttling mRNA export factor directly bound to Nup98 through the latter’s WD40-GLEBS motif (31Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M.

Interestingly, we also observed comparably high levels of eIF3L and eIF3B in the MS data analysis, as well as other eIF3 complex proteins (Fig. 1, B and C). In all, we detected 12 out of 13 proteins that form the eIF3 complex (33Masutani M. Sonenberg N. Yokoyama S. Imataka H. Reconstitution reveals the functional core of mammalian eIF3.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3373-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and these proteins were almost entirely in the top 20 most prevalent proteins of a 2AproC110A affinity capture. Unexpectedly, eIF4G was present at 10-fold lower levels than these EIF3 proteins, even though eIF4G is known to be one of the primary cleavage targets of 2Apro and so might be expected to be abundant (34Bovee M.L.

The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4GI is cleaved by different retroviral proteases.J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12392-12400Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We considered whether these observed ratios were simply reflecting the cellular protein abundance of eIF3 and eIF4G; however, MS analysis of our cell lysates (data not shown) and published work (37Beck M. Schmidt A. Malmstroem J. Claassen M. Ori A. Szymborska A. Herzog F. Rinner O. Ellenberg J. Aebersold R. The quantitative proteome of a human cell line.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7: 549Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) indicates that there is 2 to 3 fold as much eIF4G as eIF3L and the other eIF3 proteins, making this an unlikely explanation. Given the interactomic data, specifically the high levels of eIF3 proteins compared to eIF4G, the predominance of eIF3L in multiple rounds of affinity captures and the known stability of the eIF3 complex between rounds of translation (33Masutani M.

While we tentatively propose eIF3L to be the predominant binding partner for 2Apro, it is plausible that the protease makes additional interactions with other eIF3 complex components in vivo. Despite limitations resulting from the cleavage of targets and shut down of host translation for the WT protease, we were nevertheless able to glean useful results from the affinity capture of WT GFP-2Apro. Nup98 was not detected in the 2Apro dataset, almost certainly because nearly all Nup98 are cleaved within cells expressing the protease (Fig. S1). Rae1 was not detected in 2Apro affinity capture data either, again consistent with it only being present in the 2AproC110A data as the primary interacting partner of Nup98. The absence of other Nups from the 2Apro affinity capture data is not surprising, as they are likely to be second and third order interactors of Nup98 as part of the NPC. We also observed small amounts of a number of eIF3 complex proteins, presumably because amongst them are binding targets of the protease (above), but they are not themselves its primary cleavage targets. We plotted the top 20 most enriched proteins in the 2AproC110A dataset compared to 2Apro MS data, and unsurprisingly, the list consists of almost entirely NPC and eIF3 components (Fig. S5), underscoring the highly specific targeting of these over all other cellular components. Our 2AproC110A affinity capture experiments detected Nup98 bound to the catalytically inactive protease, with Rae1 bound to Nup98. However, both Nup98 and Rae1 were largely depleted from 2Apro affinity capture experiments. To determine whether Rae1 was being cleaved similarly to Nup98, we assayed our 2Apro-expressing cell line lysates by immunoblotting (Fig. S1). Indeed, 2Apro expression led to nearly total depletion of Nup98, but no cleavage of Rae1. Since Rae1 is not proteolytically degraded by 2Apro, we infer that Rae1’s absence from 2Apro affinity capture data is due to depletion of Nup98 and subsequent lack of primary binding partner for Rae1. Assaying eight other Nups by immunoblotting, we observed that 2Apro did not affect other NPC components tested, suggesting a high degree of specificity for Nup98 (Fig. S1). eIF3L was also assayed by immunoblotting and was not found to be degraded. Since endogenous eIF3L levels are not affected by 2Apro catalytic activity, this suggests that decreased levels of eIF3 components in the 2Apro affinity capture data are likely caused by other factors, such as tertiary complex destabilization. Our laboratories have developed Nup214-specific nanobodies that allow the affinity capture experiments of essentially the entire NPC. We thus affinity captured Nup214 and associated NPC proteins from cryolysed cells, utilizing our established stable WT or mutant protease expressing cell lines (Fig. 2A). Immunoblots demonstrate that Nup98 is captured during Nup214 affinity capture and that Nup98 is missing during WT 2Apro expression, almost certainly due to proteolytic degradation (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the protease was only detected in affinity captures from GFP-2AproC110A expressing cells but not those expressing GFP-2Apro, further supporting the proposal for a direct interaction between 2AproC110A and Nup98. Notably, eIF3L was also detected at much more elevated levels in the 2AproC110A expressing cells (Fig. 2B). This increase in eIF3L level correlated with the associated affinity capture of 2AproC110A, supporting the idea of a Nup98-2AproC110A-eIF3L interaction. Given this observation, we propose that 2Apro can bind Nup98 and eIF3L simultaneously, the former through the catalytic site and the latter potentially through another site (see also below). The top 40 protein interactors of the Nup214 affinity capture during GFP-2AproC110A production were ranked by label-free protein abundance and unsurprisingly revealed NPC and nuclear transport proteins as the top Nup214 associating partners (Fig. 2C). Nup98 was ranked fifth, and GFP-2AproC110A was detected in the top 40. This reverse affinity capture thus provides further evidence for a direct interaction formed between Nup98 and the 2Apro. In addition, we detected eIF3 complex proteins with relatively similar protein abundances as 2AproC110A, reinforcing the hypothesis of a direct 2AproC110A–eIF3L association. We compared Nup214 affinity capture datasets under 2Apro and 2AproC110A expression to investigate interactomic profiles and look for any outlier protein enrichment and plotted these data as a volcano plot (Fig. 2D). A number of proteins were found to be more than 3-fold enriched in the 2AproC110A affinity capture dataset, such as Nup98, Rae1, eIF3L, and eIF3K. It is not surprising that Nup98-Rae1 was highly enriched in the 2AproC110A dataset compared to 2Apro data, given that 2Apro degrades and depletes Nup98. However, it was surprising to detect enrichment of eIF3 proteins in the Nup214 affinity capture with 2AproC110A expressed, given these eIF3 proteins would effectively be fourth order interactions via the proposed binding order of Nanobody-Nup214-Nup98-2AproC110A-eIF3 (Fig. 2A – top half). Attempts to dissect and confirm which eIF3 component (such as eIF3L or eIF3K) was definitively binding to 2AproC110A (such as through chemical cross-linking, RNAi, or finding a chemical inhibitor of eIF3 complex formation) were unsuccessful, prompting the need for future larger scale biochemical studies to validate binding interactions. In a similar manner to the Nup214 affinity captures, we also assayed 2AproC110A association with Nup98 via capture of the NPC through a different bait, using the FG nup-specific monoclonal antibody, MAb414. Again, Nup98 was found to be depleted during 2Apro production (Fig. 2B), and GFP-2AproC110A was found to cofractionate with NPCs. Overall, our data reveal that CVB3 2Apro does not immediately target Nups other than Nup98 nor dramatically reorganize the structure of the NPC (though it may weaken its structure through loss of Nup98) and instead seemingly focuses on specifically depleting only Nup98—and through it, Rae1—from the NPC. Nup98 is normally produced as a bicistronic fusion protein that is separated into individual components by an autoproteolytic domain at the C terminus of Nup98 (Fig. 3) (40Stuwe T. von Borzyskowski L.S. Davenport A.M. Hoelz A. Molecular basis for the anchoring of proto-oncoprotein Nup98 to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 419: 330-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After cleavage, Nup98 and Nup96 retain a binding interaction with each other via the C terminus of Nup98 which tethers it to the NPC’s outer ring Y-shaped complex (30Guntas G. Hallett R.A. Zimmerman S.P. Williams T. Yumerefendi H. Bear J.E. Kuhlman B. Engineering an improved light-induced dimer (iLID) for controlling the localization and activity of signaling proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad.

By analyzing depletion of Nup98–Nup96 peptides from the same experiments as in Figure 2, we can assess how specific 2Apro proteolytic activity is or whether it spreads to adjoining Nups, such as Nup96. We plotted all identified Nup98-96 peptides along the length of the fusion protein (Fig. 3). We detected enormous depletion of Nup98 peptides within Nup214 affinity captures in the presence of 2Apro along the entire length of Nup98; however, Nup96 peptide levels were unaffected (as were those of all the other Nups detected; not shown), which is consistent with the hypothesis that 2Apro solely degrades Nup98 and not neighboring NPC components, despite their proxim"

The collection of water can affect the health of the whole family, particularly children. Therefore this study aims to investigate determinants of limited access to drinking water services and spatial distributions of limited access to drinking water services, unimproved drinking water sources, and toilet facilities among households in Ethiopia.Cross-sectional collected secondary data analysis was conducted based on the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). A mixed-effect logistic regression model was used for analysis. The total weighted sample of 10, 183 households was included in the analysis. The study population is comprised of all households who had recorded the time taken to fetch improved drinking water during the survey. The primary outcome of this study is the proportion of households that have limited access to drinking water services. Whereas the secondary outcomes are determinants of limited access to drinking water services and spatial distributions of limited drinking water services, unimproved drinking water sources, and toilet facilities among households in Ethiopia.In this study, 39.74% [95% CI: 38.79, 40.69] of households in Ethiopia had limited access to drinking water services. This proportion ranges from 2.64% in Addis Ababa to 57.35% in the Somali region. Household head, education, residence, and regions were associated with limited access to drinking water services. The spatial analysis showed that the eastern part of Amhara, Afar and the Somali region predicted the highest limited drinking water services. The unimproved drinking water source was detected in the Central part of Amhara, Somalia regions. Almost all regions except Addis Ababa and Diredewa predicted the highest prevalence of unimproved toilet facilities.Access to improved drinking water is relatively poor throughout Ethiopia, with some regions experiencing more limited access than others. From individual level variables age, educational level, and sex household head, whereas from community level variables residences, and region were factors significantly associated with access to limited drinking water services. The spatial analysis confirmed that there are inequalities in unimproved drinking water sources, and toilet facilities between regions in Ethiopia. The government of Ethiopia should work to increase the accessibility of improved drinking water at the national level and to narrow the gap in its accessibility between urban and rural residences and between regions. Accessibility to drinking water programs should focus on the disadvantaged group such as non-educated, male head households and living rural residences. All stalk holders should work to improve the quality of drinking water and sanitation facilities."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in humans and the leading cause of dementia. The pathology of AD is characterized by the deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide in the brain parenchyma and blood vessels. Aβ is generated by the two-step proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (1Yan R. Vassar R.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is defined as the deposition of Aβ on the vascular walls of the meninges and brain, giving rise to intracerebral hemorrhage and cognitive impairment in the elderly (7Charidimou A.

However, epidemiological and clinicopathological data alone do not fully describe the pathological association between CAA and AD. Impaired clearance and/or overproduction of Aβ lead to its accumulation in the brains of patients with AD (8Mawuenyega K.G. Sigurdson W. Ovod V. Munsell L. Kasten T. Morris J.C. Yarasheski K.E. Bateman R.J. Decreased clearance of CNS beta-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease.Science. 2010; 330: 1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Most neuronal Aβ is transported across the blood–brain barrier into the blood (9Tarasoff-Conway J.M. Carare R.O. Osorio R.S. Glodzik L. Butler T. Fieremans E. Axel L. Rusinek H. Nicholson C. Zlokovic B.V. Frangione B. Blennow K. Menard J. Zetterberg H. Wisniewski T. et al.Clearance systems in the brain-implications for Alzheimer disease.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2015; 11: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), and as such, the blood Aβ can derive from a mixture of APP sources including from neurons, smooth muscle cells, ECs, and pericytes, all of which can contribute to vascular Aβ deposition (10Burgermeister P. Calhoun M.E. Winkler D.T. Jucker M. Mechanisms of cerebrovascular amyloid deposition. Lessons from mouse models.Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 903: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence shows that several anti-Aβ immunotherapies reduce the amyloid burden in brain parenchyma, while augmenting that of vascular Aβ accumulation (11Nicoll J.A. Wilkinson D. Holmes C.

A major therapeutic concern with some anti-Aβ antibodies is the possible breakdown of the blood–brain barrier associated with brain edema and cerebral microhemorrhages, which are observed under magnetic resonance imaging as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) (13Sperling R.

It is thus important to clarify how brain Aβ accumulates in the vascular walls. Unfortunately, most AD model mice with parenchymal Aβ deposition exhibit only moderate Aβ deposition in the brain blood vessels (14Sasaguri H. Nilsson P. Hashimoto S. Nagata K. Saito T. De Strooper B. Hardy J. Vassar R. Winblad B. Saido T.C. APP mouse models for Alzheimer's disease preclinical studies.EMBO J. 2017; 36: 2473-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Based on our initial study showing that human vascular ECs express a significantly high level of APP770 (3Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Kato M. Yamaguchi Y. Honda T. Hashimoto Y. Wada Y. Saito T. Iwata N. Saido T. Taniguchi N. Brain endothelial cells produce amyloid {beta} from amyloid precursor protein 770 and preferentially secrete the O-glycosylated form.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 40097-40103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and that the level of serum soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) in rodents is less than 1% of that in human serum, we explored the possibility that limited endothelial APP expression could result in a markedly reduced CAA pathology in rodent models. In this study, we have developed a novel mouse model that expresses human APP770 (hAPP770) in ECs. We show that the mice exhibited significantly high levels of blood sAPP770 and Aβ40, whereas the accumulation of Aβ in their blood vessels was almost undetectable. However, crossing with APP knock-in (KI) mice resulted in an expanded CAA pathology. These results show that both neuronal and endothelial APP contribute cooperatively to vascular Aβ deposition. We first measured blood sAPP levels in human, rats, and mice. Human serum and plasma were shown to contain 300 and 5.1 ng/ml sAPP770, respectively (Fig. 1A). The reason for this difference is that platelets store sAPP770 in α-granules and release it into the serum upon activation (4Miura S. Yoshihisa A. Misaka T. Yamaki T. Kojima T. Toyokawa M. Ogawa K. Shimura H. Yamamoto N. Kasahara K. Takeishi Y. Kitazume S. Amyloid precursor protein 770 is specifically expressed and released from platelets.J. Biol.

Fischer P. The amyloid precursor protein of Alzheimer's disease is released by human platelets.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15977-15983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next measured blood sAPPtotal, which accounts for sAPP695, sAPP751, and sAPP770. To our surprise, sAPPtotal in human plasma was also significantly lower (42 ng/ml) than that in serum (890 ng/ml), just like the case of sAPP770, and strong correlations between sAPPtotal and sAPP770 levels in both plasma (r = 0.97, p < 0.0001) and serum (r = 0.89, p < 0.01) were found. In contrast, plasma and serum sAPPtotal levels in rats were 70 pg/ml and 1.1 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 1B), which were markedly lower (0.3%) than those measured in human samples. In mice, blood sAPP levels were even undetectable in some cases. Standard AD model mice, AppNL-F/NL-F, showed a slightly higher sAPP770 level in serum, although this still constitutes less than 0.5% of the level in human samples. Even though APP is considered to be expressed ubiquitously (16Muller U.C. Zheng H. Physiological functions of APP family proteins.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2a006288Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that endothelial APP expression might be limited in rodents, which could result in markedly lower levels of blood sAPP and subtle CAA pathology in most AD mouse models. It is considered that a humanized Aβ sequence is necessary for amyloid plaque formation in such models (17Saito T. Matsuba Y. Mihira N. Takano J. Nilsson P. Itohara S. Iwata N. Saido T.C. Single App knock-in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis, we developed a new mouse model that specifically expresses hAPP770 with the Swedish (KM670/671NL) mutation (18Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J.

We first generated floxed hAPP770NL mice (EC-APP770−) under the cytomegalovirus early enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter (Fig. 1, C and D) and then crossed these mice with Tie2-Cre mice, which specifically express Cre recombinase in the ECs by Tie2 promoter (19Kisanuki Y.Y.

We used the brains from 15-month-old EC-APP770+ and EC-APP770− mice to isolate ECs, which were the cells positive for platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) and negative for the neuronal marker βIII-tubulin in Western blot analysis (Fig. 1E). The results showed that an increased APP signal was not detectable in total brain lysates from either type of mouse, possibly because neurons and glial cells, which are major cell populations in total brains, do not express hAPP770, and ECs are a minor cell population in the brain (20Mathys H. Davila-Velderrain J. Peng Z. Gao F. Mohammadi S. Young J.Z. Menon M. He L. Abdurrob F. Jiang X. Martorell A.J. Ransohoff R.M. Hafler B.P. Bennett D.A. Kellis M. et al.Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of Alzheimer's disease.Nature. 2019; 570: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In contrast, we could detect an increased APP signal in the lysates of brain ECs isolated from EC-APP770+ mice. Since an anti-APP antibody, APP(C), detects the carboxy-terminal region of APP that is common to both mouse and hAPP, we quantified the signal intensities of GAPDH and APP in the ECs isolated from EC-APP770+ and EC-APP770− mice and estimated the expression level of endothelial hAPP770 in EC-APP770+ mice to be about three times higher than that in EC-APP770− mice. We also isolated ECs from the lungs of two types of mice and observed an increased APP signal in EC-APP770+ mice. Moreover, ELISA successfully detected hAPP770 in the ECs derived from brains and lungs of EC-APP770+ mice (Fig. 1F), showing that endothelial hAPP770 expression is not limited to the brain. Taken together, these findings indicate that hAPP770 is specifically expressed in the ECs of EC-APP770+ mice. A considerable portion of the extracellular region of endothelial APP770 is cleaved for shedding from cultured ECs, and the cells secrete both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the culture medium (3Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Kato M. Yamaguchi Y. Honda T. Hashimoto Y. Wada Y. Saito T. Iwata N. Saido T. Taniguchi N. Brain endothelial cells produce amyloid {beta} from amyloid precursor protein 770 and preferentially secrete the O-glycosylated form.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 40097-40103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We thus anticipated that human sAPP770 and Aβ would be detectable in the serum of EC-APP770+ mice. Indeed, serum human sAPP770 levels in 12- and 24-month-old EC-APP770+ mice were 4 to 5 μg/ml, whereas they were undetectable in EC-APP770− mice (Fig. 2A). We used ELISA, specific to sAPPβ-sw, and measured sAPP770β levels in EC-APP770+ mice to be ∼300 ng/ml, whereas sAPP770β was not detectable in EC-APP770− mice. The serum sAPP770β level in EC-APP770+ mice is less than 8% of total sAPP770, which compares favorably with the case in humans, in which the sAPPα level is about 15-fold the sAPPβ level (21Ray B. Long J.M. Sokol D.K. Lahiri D.K. Increased secreted amyloid precursor protein-alpha (sAPPalpha) in severe autism: Proposal of a specific, anabolic pathway and putative biomarker.PLoS One. 2011; 6e20405Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). No age-dependent difference was detectable for serum sAPP770 or sAPP770β, and we confirmed unaltered serum sAPPα levels in 2- and 36-month-old rats. We also found that serum Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were markedly higher in EC-APP770+ mice than in EC-APP770− mice (Fig. 2B). To our knowledge, these data clearly show for the first time that endothelial APP contributes to blood Aβ levels. We did not observe an age-dependent difference in serum Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels between 12- and 24-month-old mice. We next sought to determine whether EC-APP770+ mice show increased CAA pathology with aging. We found that steady-state levels of brain Aβ40 were similar between EC-APP770− and EC-APP770+ mice (Fig. 2C). We then isolated ECs from the brains of EC-APP770+ and EC-APP770− mice, but the accumulation of Aβ40/42 in EC-APP770+ mice was hardly detectable (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analyses failed to detect apparent Aβ40/42 signals in cells positive for the endothelial marker PECAM in the brains of 15-month-old EC-APP770+ mice (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that endothelial APP expression itself does not lead to Aβ deposition in brain blood vessels. We next considered whether endothelial APP expression influences AD and/or CAA pathology and crossed EC-APP770+ mice with AD model mice, AppNL-F/NL-F. Congo red staining of the brain sections of 15-month-old EC-APP770+:AppNL-F/NL-F mice demonstrated the amyloid deposits in the cerebral leptomeningeal vessels, a pathological hallmark of CAA (22Herzig M.C.

Abeta is targeted to the vasculature in a mouse model of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), in addition to parenchymal amyloid plaques (Fig. 3A). To examine plaque formation in detail, we next used a Congo red derivative, 1-fluoro-2,5-bis(3-carboxy-4-hydroxystyryl)benzene (FSB), on 30 μm frozen sections of 15-month-old EC-APP770+, EC-APP770−, EC-APP770+:AppNL-F/NL-F, EC-APP770−:AppNL-F/NL-F, and AppNL-F/NL-F mouse brains (23Higuchi M. Iwata N. Matsuba Y. Sato K. Sasamoto K. Saido T.C. 19F and 1H MRI detection of amyloid beta plaques in vivo.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Both EC-APP770+ and EC-APP770− mouse brains exhibit negligible FSB signals, whereas AppNL-F/NL-F mouse brains exhibit FSB-positive parenchymal plaques in both cortex and hippocampus, as previously reported (Fig. 3B) (17Saito T. Matsuba Y. Mihira N. Takano J. Nilsson P. Itohara S. Iwata N. Saido T.C. Single App knock-in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). A striking feature was observed in EC-APP770+:AppNL-F/NL-F mouse brain, namely, massive amyloid plaque deposition in both cortical and hippocampal regions. Quantitative analysis showed that the percentage of FSB-positive area in the cortex was highest in EC-APP770+:AppNL-F/NL-F mice (Fig. 3C). In AppNL-F/NL-F mice, none of the FSB-positive plaques was colocalized with the signal for phalloidin-Alexa 546, a vascular smooth muscle cell marker, whereas most FSB signals were phalloidin positive in EC-APP770+:AppNL-F/NL-F mice (Fig. 3D), indicating that crossing EC-APP770+ mice with APP-KI mice results in the robust deposition of amyloid plaques in brain blood vessels. Magnified images of blood vessels showed that FSB signals were present in the luminal regions of phalloidin-Alexa 546-positive vessels. To characterize the amyloid plaques in greater detail, we performed integrated morphometric analysis in which FSB-positive amyloid plaques were counted and classified on the basis of size. Larger amyloid deposits, corresponding to plaque sizes of over 400 μm2, were prominent in EC-APP770+:AppNL-F/NL-F mice but not in AppNL-F/NL-F mice (Fig. 3D). This suggested that most parenchymal plaques were less than 400 μm2, and large FSB signals were mostly vascular amyloids.Figure 3Offspring of EC-APP770+ mice crossed with APP-KI mice exhibit marked Aβ deposition in brain blood vessels.

The number of parenchymal plaques in cortical regions of EC-APP770+:AppNL-F/NL-F mice was about two times higher than that in AppNL-F/NL-F mice (Fig. 3E). However, as a similar increase was also observed in EC-APP770−:AppNL-F/NL-F mice, we speculated that this could be due to an undesired effect arising from insertion of the floxed hAPP770 transgene. We then decided to determine the integration site of the transgene by next-generation sequencing and found that it was within the intron between exons 3 and 4 of the Ikzf3 gene in chromosome 11 (Fig. 4A). The integration site was confirmed by genomic PCR using primers against genomic DNA and the transgene (Fig. 4B). The Ikzf3 gene encodes Aiolos, a member of the Ikaros family of zinc-finger proteins, which shows restricted expression in the lymphoid system, and regulates lymphocyte differentiation (24Morgan B. Sun L. Avitahl N. Andrikopoulos K. Ikeda T. Gonzales E. Wu P. Neben S. Georgopoulos K. Aiolos, a lymphoid restricted transcription factor that interacts with Ikaros to regulate lymphocyte differentiation.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2004-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Aiolos expression was not detectable in the brains, and we then measured Ikzf3 mRNA levels in the spleens of EC-APP770+, EC-APP770−, and WT mice. Because reference sequence data suggest the presence of Ikzf3 transcript variants, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed using multiple primers and probes for different exonic regions of Ikzf3 mRNA. The mRNA level of splenic Ikzf3 in EC-APP770− mice, determined by a series of primers and probe sets, showed a tendency to be lower than those in WT and EC-APP770+ mice, whereas WT and EC-APP770+ mice showed similar Ikzf3 mRNA levels (Fig. 4C). As biochemical analyses previously showed that Aβ isoforms shorter than 42 residues form a component of the cerebrovascular amyloid from patients with AD (25Prelli F. Castano E. Glenner G.G. Frangione B. Differences between vascular and plaque core amyloid in Alzheimer's disease.J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we next performed immunohistochemical analyses on brain sections from EC-APP770+:AppNL-F/NL-F, EC-APP770−:AppNL-F/NL-F, and AppNL-F/NL-F mice to detect different Aβ species. Strong Aβ42 and weak Aβ40 signals were found in AppNL-F/NL-F mice (Fig. 5A), as has been reported previously (17Saito T. Matsuba Y. Mihira N. Takano J. Nilsson P. Itohara S. Iwata N. Saido T.C. Single App knock-in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, both EC-APP770+:AppNL-F/NL-F and EC-APP770−:AppNL-F/NL-F mice exhibited large numbers of Aβ40 and Aβ42 plaques. Quantitative analysis showed that significantly higher levels of Aβ40 were accumulated in EC-APP770+:AppNL-F/NL-F mice than in AppNL-F/NL-F mice, whereas the accumulation of Aβ42 did not differ in these mice (Fig. 5B). Notably, most of the signal of Aβ40, but not of Aβ42, was colocalized with that of PECAM, indicating that the deposition of Aβ40 is restricted to brain blood vessels, whereas Aβ42 signal was observed exclusively in the brain parenchyma; quantitative analysis supported this observation (Fig. 5C). Notably, enlarged perivascular spaces, suggestive CAA indicators (26Charidimou A. Meegahage R. Fox Z. Peeters A. Vandermeeren Y. Laloux P. Baron J.C. Jager H.R. Werring D.J. Enlarged perivascular spaces as a marker of underlying arteriopathy in intracerebral haemorrhage: A multicentre MRI cohort study.J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2013; 84: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), are observed in the brains of EC-APP770+:AppNL-F/NL-F (Figs. 5A and S1). These results also suggest that endothelial APP expression in AD model mice exacerbates CAA pathology. Particular Aβ isoforms in blood have recently been reported to be valuable biomarkers for AD diagnosis (27Nakamura A. Kaneko N. Villemagne V.L. Kato T. Doecke J. Dore V. Fowler C. Li Q.X. Martins R. Rowe C. Tomita T. Matsuzaki K. Ishii K. Ishii K. Arahata Y. et al.High performance plasma amyloid-beta biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.Nature. 2018; 554: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In our study, endothelial hAPP expression in mice led to a dramatic increase of serum Aβ levels, suggesting that blood Aβ is mostly derived from endothelial APP770. Given that the levels of cerebrospinal fluid Aβ, plasma Aβ, and brain Aβ are highly correlated in patients with AD, endothelial Aβ production could be related to not only endothelial dysfunction but also AD progression (28Greenberg S.M. Bacskai B.J. Hernandez-Guillamon M. Pruzin J. Sperling R. van Veluw S.J. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer disease - one peptide, two pathways.Nat. Rev.

Expression and processing of amyloid precursor protein in vascular endothelium.Physiology (Bethesda). 2017; 32: 20-32PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether the Aβ in accumulated plaque in cortical blood vessels is derived from the circulation, the blood vessel wall itself, or the central nervous system (30Auriel E. Greenberg S.M. The pathophysiology and clinical presentation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2012; 14: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). High levels of plasma Aβ do not cause CAA in Tg mice expressing signal peptide plus the carboxyl-terminal region of APP that contains Aβ (31Fukuchi K. Ho L. Younkin S.G. Kunkel D.D. Ogburn C.E.

Pathol. 1996; 149: 219-227PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as intraperitoneal inoculation with Aβ-rich brain extracts (possibly containing Aβ oligomers) from AD model mice can induce CAA in APP-overexpressing mice (32Eisele Y.S. Obermuller U.

The present study investigated the antibacterial efficacy of HICA against some important bacteria associated with food quality and safety and provided some insights into its possible antimicrobial mechanisms against bacteria. The results revealed that HICA was effective in inhibiting the growth of tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including a multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa strain in this study. The underlying mechanism was investigated by measuring the cell membrane integrity, membrane permeability, membrane depolarisation, and morphological and ultrastructural changes after HICA treatment in bacterial cells. The evidence supports that HICA exerts its activity via penetration of the bacterial cell membranes, thereby causing depolarisation, rupture of membranes, subsequent leakage of cellular contents and cell death. The current study suggests that HICA has potential to be used as an antibacterial agent against food spoilage and food-borne pathogenic bacteria, targeting the bacterial cell envelope."
https://openalex.org/W4225857329,"Background We reported that chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 2 (CXCR2) signaling appears to play an important role in the pathogenic signaling of gastric cancer (GC), and although CXCR2 may have a role in other solid cancers, the significance of CXCR2 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) has not been evaluated. Herein, we determined the clinicopathologic significance of CXCL1-CXCR2 signaling in CCA. Materials and methods Two human CCA cell lines, OCUG-1 and HuCCT1, were used. CXCR2 expression was examined by western blotting. We investigated the effects of CXCL1 on the proliferation (by MTT assay) and migration activity (by a wound-healing assay) of each cell line. Our immunohistochemical study of the cases of 178 CCA patients examined the expression levels of CXCR2 and CXCL1, and we analyzed the relationship between these expression levels and the patients’ clinicopathologic features. Results CXCR2 was expressed on both CCA cell lines. CXCL1 significantly inhibited both the proliferative activity and migratory activity of both cell lines. CXCL1 and CXCR2 were immunohistochemically expressed in 73% and 18% of the CCA cases, respectively. The CXCL1-positive group was significantly associated with negative lymph node metastasis (p = 0.043). The CXCR2-positive group showed significantly better survival (p = 0.042, Kaplan-Meier). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that CXCR2 expression (p = 0.031) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.004) were significantly correlated with the CCA patients’ overall survival. Conclusion CXCR2 signaling might exert a tumor-suppressive effect on CCA cells. CXCR2 might be a useful independent prognostic marker for CCA patients after surgical resection."
https://openalex.org/W4225983737,"Background The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is presently being tested to control dengue in several countries. SIT aims to cause the decline of the target insect population through the release of a sufficient number of sterilized male insects. This induces sterility in the female population, as females that mate with sterilized males produce no offspring. Male insects are sterilized through the use of ionizing irradiation. This study aimed to evaluate variable parameters that may affect irradiation in mosquito pupae. Methods An Ae . aegypti colony was maintained under standard laboratory conditions. Male and female Ae . aegypti pupae were separated using a Fay and Morlan glass sorter and exposed to different doses of gamma radiation (40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 Gy) using a Co 60 source. The effects of radiation on survival, flight ability and the reproductive capacity of Ae . aegypti were evaluated under laboratory conditions. In addition, mating competitiveness was evaluated for irradiated male Ae . aegypti mosquitoes to be used for future SIT programmes in Sri Lanka. Results Survival of irradiated pupae was reduced by irradiation in a dose-dependent manner but it was invariably greater than 90% in control, 40, 50, 60, 70 Gy in both male and female Ae . aegypti . Irradiation didn’t show any significant adverse effects on flight ability of male and female mosquitoes, which consistently exceeded 90%. A similar number of eggs per female was observed between the non-irradiated groups and the irradiated groups for both irradiated males and females. Egg hatch rates were significantly lower when an irradiation dose above 50 Gy was used as compared to 40 Gy in both males and females. Irradiation at higher doses significantly reduced male and female survival when compared to the non-irradiated Ae . aegypti mosquitoes. Competitiveness index (C) scores of sterile and non-sterile males compared with non-irradiated male mosquitoes under laboratory and semi-field conditions were 0.56 and 0.51 respectively at 50 Gy. Signification Based on the results obtained from the current study, a 50 Gy dose was selected as the optimal radiation dose for the production of sterile Ae . aegypti males for future SIT-based dengue control programmes aiming at the suppression of Ae . aegypti populations in Sri Lanka."

The strength of synaptic connections is costly to measure yet important for accurate circuit modeling. Synaptic surface area has been shown to correlate with synaptic strength, yet in the emerging field of connectomics, most studies rely instead on the counts of synaptic contacts between two neurons. Here we quantified the relationship between synaptic count and synaptic area as measured from volume electron microscopy of the larval Drosophila central nervous system. We found that the total synaptic surface area, summed across all synaptic contacts from one presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic one, can be accurately predicted solely from the number of synaptic contacts, for a variety of neurotransmitters. Our findings support the use of synaptic counts for approximating synaptic strength when modeling neural circuits."

The restoration of DYSTROPHIN is expected to be a curative therapy for DMD. Because muscle stem cells (MuSCs) can regenerate damaged myofibers with full-length DYSTROPHIN in vivo, their transplantation is being explored as such a therapy. As for the transplanted cells, primary satellite cells have been considered, but donor shortage limits their clinical application. We previously developed a protocol that differentiates induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to MuSCs (iMuSCs). To ameliorate the respiratory function of DMD patients, cell transplantation to the diaphragm is necessary but difficult, because the diaphragm is thin and rapidly moves. In the present study, we explored the transplantation of iMuSCs into the diaphragm. First, we show direct cell injection into the diaphragm of mouse was feasible. Then, to enhance the engraftment of the transplanted cells in a rapidly moving diaphragm, we mixed polymer solutions of hyaluronic acid, alginate and gelatin to the cell suspension, finding a solution of 20% dissolved hyaluronic acid and 80% dissolved gelatin improved the engraftment. Thus, we established a method for cell transplantation into mouse diaphragm and show that an injectable hyaluronic acid-gelatin solution enables the engraftment of iMuSCs in the diaphragm."
https://openalex.org/W4220691067,"The PKC family consists of several closely related kinases. These enzymes regulate the function of proteins through the phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups on serines and/or threonines. The selective activation of individual PKC isozymes has proven challenging because of a lack of specific activator molecules. Here, we developed an optogenetic blue light-activated PKC isozyme that harnesses a plant-based dimerization system between the photosensitive cryptochrome-2 (CRY2) and the N terminus of the transcription factor calcium and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB1) (N-terminal region of the CRY2-binding domain of CIB1). We show that tagging CRY2 with the catalytic domain of PKC isozymes can efficiently promote its translocation to the cell surface upon blue light exposure. We demonstrate this system using PKCε and show that this leads to robust activation of a K+ channel (G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels 1 and 4), previously shown to be activated by PKCε. We anticipate that this approach can be utilized for other PKC isoforms to provide a reliable and direct stimulus for targeted membrane protein phosphorylation by the relevant PKCs."
https://openalex.org/W4220804052,"Aquaponics is an agricultural practice incorporating aquaculture and hydroponic principles. This study assesses the current system design and production practices of the aquaponic industry, compares these metrics by stakeholder group, identifies trends, and provides recommendations for future development. An electronic survey of aquaponic stakeholders was conducted from December 2019 to June 2020 targeting hobbyists, producers, and educators from various aquaponic-focused professional associations, email and social media groups. Of 378 total responses, 84% came from the United States and were clustered in plant hardiness zones five to nine. Aquaponic systems were commonly homemade/do-it-yourself (DIY), many of which incorporated commercially available (turn-key) technology. Most growers used coupled systems that integrated recirculating aquaculture systems and either deep-water culture (DWC) or media bed hydroponic units. Common plant lighting sources were sunlight and light emitting diode (LED). Water sources were typically municipal or wells. Personal labor input was typically less than 20 hrs/wk. Funding sources were primarily personal funds, followed by government grants, and private investor funds. System sizes varied greatly, but the median area was 50 to 500 ft 2 for hobbyists and educators and 500 to 3,000 ft 2 for producers. Respondents commonly sold vegetable produce, training and education, food fish, and microgreens. Tilapia and ornamental fish were commonly grown, with 16 other species reported. Common crops were lettuce, leafy greens, basil, tomatoes, peppers, and herbs with many additional lesser-grown crops reported, including cannabis. Overall, the industry still growing, with a large portion of stakeholders having less than two years of experience. However, veteran growers have remained in operation, particularly in the producer and educator groups. The survey results suggest a shift away from outdoor systems, media beds, tomatoes, ornamental fish, and perch production, and a shift toward decoupled systems, DWC, drip irrigation, and wicking beds, larger system area, leafy greens, and trout/salmon production compared to previous industry surveys. The reduced diversity of plant species grown suggest some level of crop standardization. Commercial producers tended to sell more types of products than other stakeholders, suggesting that diversification of offerings may be key to profitability. The combined production area specified by respondents indicates the industry has grown substantially in recent years. Finally, the presence of bank loan-funded operations suggests increased knowledge and comfort with aquaponics among lenders."
https://openalex.org/W4221028456,"Abstract The IL-36 cytokines are a recently described subset of the IL-1 family of cytokines, shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of intestinal diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Given the link between IBD and colitis –associated cancer, as well as the involvement of other IL-1 family members in intestinal tumorigenesis, the aim of this work was to investigate whether IL-36 cytokines play a role in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Whilst research to date has focused on the role of IL-36 family members in augmenting the immune response to induce tumour rejection, very little remains known about IL-36R signalling in tumour cells in this context. In this study we demonstrate that expression of IL-36 family member mRNA and protein are significantly increased in colorectal cancer tissue compared to adjacent non-tumour. In vitro assays showed stimulation of colon cancer cell lines with IL-36R agonists resulted in the activation of the pro-tumorigenic phenotypes of increased cellular migration, invasion and proliferation in both 2D and 3D models. In addition, the IL-36 cytokines induced strong expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines in both human and murine cell lines. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-36Ra significantly reduced tumour burden using the subcutaneous CT26 tumour model in syngeneic Balb/mice, and this was associated with a decrease in Ki-67 expression by tumour cells in the IL-36Ra- treated group relative to untreated, suggesting the inhibition of the pro-proliferative signalling of IL-36 agonists resulted in the decreased tumour size. Moreover, colon cancer cells lacking the IL-36R also showed reduced tumour growth and reduced Ki-67 expression in vivo. Taken together, this data suggests that targeting IL-36R signalling may be a useful targeted therapy for colorectal cancer patients with IL-36R + tumour cells."
https://openalex.org/W4225693097,"People are obtaining more and more information from social media and other online sources, but the spread of misinformation can lead to social disruption. In particular, social networking services (SNSs) can easily spread information of uncertain authenticity and factuality. Although many studies have proposed methods that addressed how to suppress the spread of misinformation on SNSs, few works have examined the impact on society of diffusing both misinformation and its corrective information. This study models the effects of effort to reduce misinformation and the diffusion of corrective information on social disruption, and it clarifies these effects. With the aim of reducing the impact on social disruption, we show that not only misinformation but also corrective information can cause social disruption, and we clarify how to control the spread of the latter to limit its impact. We analyzed the misinformation about a toilet-paper shortage and its correction as well as the social disruption this event caused in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. First, (1) we analyzed the extent to which misinformation and its corrections spread on SNS, and then (2) we created a model to estimate the impact of misinformation and its corrections on the world. Finally, (3) We used our model to analyze the change in this impact when the diffusion of the misinformation and its corrections changed. Based on our analysis results in (1), the corrective information spread much more widely than the misinformation. From the model developed in (2), the corrective information caused excessive purchasing behavior. The analysis results in (3) show that the amount of corrective information required to minimize the societal impact depends on the amount of misinformation diffusion. Most previous studies concentrated on the impact of corrective information on attitudes toward misinformation. On the other hand, the most significant contribution of this study is that it focuses on the impact of corrective information on society and clarifies the appropriate amount of it."
https://openalex.org/W4225885264,"Purpose The aim of this study was to explore how adolescents accessed, understood, appraised, and applied information on pandemic preventive measures, how their lives were impacted by long-lasting regulations and how they described their quality of life. Methods A qualitative design with focus group interviews was used to elaborate on the quantitative survey results obtained and analyzed in a previous survey study from the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. Five focus groups with seventeen adolescents were conducted digitally during the second pandemic phase in November and December 2020. The interview data were analyzed with directed content analysis. Results The adolescents reported using traditional media and official websites as sources for Covid-19 information. They engaged in preventive behavior, and washing hands and keeping a distance from strangers had become a habit. However, not being physically close to friends felt strange and unpleasant. The measure most frequently discussed was limiting social contact, which was a constant struggle. No one disputed the authorities’ guidelines and rules, but the social restrictions caused boredom and despair, particularly due to interrupted schooling and missed opportunities to engage in life events, and freely socialize with friends. Conclusion The adolescents gave an overall impression of being health literate, which corresponds well with the results from our previous survey study. Their descriptions of how they translated protective measures into their everyday lives demonstrate that they took responsibility and accepted personal costs for the collective good. However, life with social restrictions decreased their quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4220834952,"Peptide-derived natural products are a large class of bioactive molecules that often contain chemically challenging modifications. In the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs), radical-SAM (rSAM) enzymes have been shown to catalyze the formation of ether, thioether, and carbon-carbon bonds on the precursor peptide. The installation of these bonds typically establishes the skeleton of the mature RiPP. To facilitate the search for unexplored rSAM-dependent RiPPs for the community, we employed a bioinformatic strategy to screen a subfamily of peptide-modifying rSAM enzymes which are known to bind up to three [4Fe-4S] clusters. A sequence similarity network was used to partition related families of rSAM enzymes into >250 clusters. Using representative sequences, genome neighborhood diagrams were generated using the Genome Neighborhood Tool. Manual inspection of bacterial genomes yielded numerous putative rSAM-dependent RiPP pathways with unique features. From this analysis, we identified and experimentally characterized the rSAM enzyme, TvgB, from the tvg gene cluster from Halomonas anticariensis. In the tvg gene cluster, the precursor peptide, TvgA, is comprised of a repeating TVGG motif. Structural characterization of the TvgB product revealed the repeated formation of cyclopropylglycine, where a new bond is formed between the γ-carbons on the precursor valine. This novel RiPP modification broadens the functional potential of rSAM enzymes and validates the proposed bioinformatic approach as a practical broad search tool for the discovery of new RiPP topologies."
https://openalex.org/W4220929279,"Worldwide, the frequency (pitch) of blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) calls has been decreasing since first recorded in the 1960s. This frequency decline occurs over annual and inter-annual timescales and has recently been documented in other baleen whale species, yet it remains unexplained. In the Northeast Pacific, blue whales produce two calls, or units, that, when regularly repeated, are referred to as song: A and B calls. In this population, frequency decline has thus far only been examined in B calls. In this work, passive acoustic data collected in the Southern California Bight from 2006 to 2019 were examined to determine if A calls are also declining in frequency and whether the call pulse rate was similarly impacted. Additionally, frequency measurements were made for B calls to determine whether the rate of frequency decline is the same as was calculated when this phenomenon was first reported in 2009. We found that A calls decreased at a rate of 0.32 Hz yr-1 during this period and that B calls were still decreasing, albeit at a slower rate (0.27 Hz yr-1) than reported previously. The A call pulse rate also declined over the course of the study, at a rate of 0.006 pulses/s yr-1. With this updated information, we consider the various theories that have been proposed to explain frequency decline in blue whales. We conclude that no current theory adequately accounts for all aspects of this phenomenon and consider the role that individual perception of song frequency may play. To understand the cause behind call frequency decline, future studies might want to explore the function of these songs and the mechanism for their synchronization. The ubiquitous nature of the frequency shift phenomenon may indicate a consistent level of vocal plasticity and fine auditory processing abilities across baleen whale species."
https://openalex.org/W4225568120,"Article-level measures of publication impact (alternative metrics or altmetrics) can help authors and other stakeholders assess engagement with their research and the success of their communication efforts. The wide variety of altmetrics can make interpretation and comparative assessment difficult; available summary tools are either narrowly focused or do not reflect the differing values of metrics from a stakeholder perspective. We created the EMPIRE (EMpirical Publication Impact and Reach Evaluation) Index, a value-based, multi-component metric framework for medical publications. Metric weighting and grouping were informed by a statistical analysis of 2891 Phase III clinical trial publications and by a panel of stakeholders who provided value assessments. The EMPIRE Index comprises three component scores (social, scholarly, and societal impact), each incorporating related altmetrics indicating a different aspect of engagement with the publication. These are averaged to provide a total impact score and benchmarked so that a score of 100 equals the mean scores of Phase III clinical trial publications in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in 2016. Predictor metrics are defined to estimate likely long-term impact. The social impact component correlated strongly with the Altmetric Attention Score and the scholarly impact component correlated modestly with CiteScore, with the societal impact component providing unique insights. Analysis of fresh metrics collected 1 year after the initial dataset, including an independent sample, showed that scholarly and societal impact scores continued to increase, whereas social impact scores did not. Analysis of NEJM 'notable articles' showed that observational studies had the highest total impact and component scores, except for societal impact, for which surgical studies had the highest score. The EMPIRE Index provides a richer assessment of publication value than standalone traditional and alternative metrics and may enable medical researchers to assess the impact of publications easily and to understand what characterizes impactful research."
https://openalex.org/W4225839339,"Background Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is inadequate to meet the physiologic needs of the human body oxygen and it is highly prevalent among individuals with metabolic syndromes as a complication in turn speed up the progression and the number of adverse outcomes unless the proper measure is undertaken. Determination of anemia may play a major role in the management and early aversion of complications in an admitted patient with metabolic syndromes. Therefore, this study aimed to determine anemia and its associated factors among patients with admitted metabolic syndromes at Worabe Comprehensive Specialized hospital, Southern Ethiopia from March 1 to May 30, 2021. Methods and materials An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was conducted on 324 adult patients admitted with metabolic syndromes. Structured questionnaires through face-to-face interviews and participants’ medical records were used to collect information on determinants related to anemia. A blood sample was collected to determine hematological parameters, biochemical profile, and blood film preparation. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 22. Binary logistic regression analyses were done to identify factors associated with anemia. The p-value was set at &lt;0.05 with a 95% confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio. Results A total of 324 admitted adult patients with metabolic syndromes were involved. The overall prevalence of anemia among study participants was 25.3% (95%CI: 20.7, 30.2), of which 52.4% had moderate anemia and 56% had microcytic types of anemia. Being alcoholic (AOR = 6.25, 95% CI: (3.05, 12.82)), obese (AOR = 3.34, 95% CI: (1.02, 11.21)), dyslipidemic (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI: (1.02, 4.17)), and diabetic (AOR = 2.61, 95%CI: (1.31, 5.21)) were significantly associated with anemia. Conclusion The prevalence of anemia among patients admitted with metabolic syndrome observed in this study was a moderate public health problem. Taking alcohol, being dyslipidemic, obese and diabetic was significantly associated with anemia. The finding of this study should be taken into consideration to implement preventive interventions on identified factors in study percipients. Taking fruit and vegetable, and promoting physical exercise, routine determination of fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin level in adult admitted metabolic syndromes patients were recommended to minimize the emergence of anemia."

We investigated the fidelity, impact, and cost-effectiveness of two parenting programs delivered within a longitudinal proportionate delivery model ('E-SEE Steps').Eligible parents with a child ≤ 8 weeks were recruited into a parallel two-arm, assessor blinded, randomized controlled, community-based, trial with embedded economic and process evaluations. Post-baseline randomization applied a 5:1 (intervention-to-control) ratio, stratified by primary (child social-emotional wellbeing (ASQ:SE-2)) and key secondary (maternal depression (PHQ-9)) outcome scores, sex, and site. All intervention parents received the Incredible Years® Baby Book (IY-B), and were offered the targeted Infant (IY-I)/Toddler (IY-T) program if eligible, based on ASQ:SE-2/PHQ-9 scores. Control families received usual services. Fidelity data were analysed descriptively. Primary analysis applied intention to treat. Effectiveness analysis fitted a marginal model to outcome scores. Cost-effectiveness analysis involved Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs).The target sample (N = 606) was not achieved; 341 mothers were randomized (285:56), 322 (94%) were retained to study end. Of those eligible for the IY-I (n = 101), and IY-T (n = 101) programs, 51 and 21 respectively, attended. Eight (of 14) groups met the 80% self-reported fidelity criteria. No significant differences between arms were found for adjusted mean difference scores; ASQ:SE-2 (3.02, 95% CI: -0.03, 6.08, p = 0.052), PHQ-9 (-0.61; 95% CI: -1.34, 0.12, p = 0.1). E-SEE Steps had higher costs, but improved mothers' Health-related Quality of Life (0.031 Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gain), ICER of £20,062 per QALY compared to control. Serious adverse events (n = 86) were unrelated to the intervention.E-SEE Steps was not effective, but was borderline cost-effective. The model was delivered with varying fidelity, with lower-than-expected IY-T uptake.

https://openalex.org/W4226124637,"As different SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge and with the continuous evolvement of sub lineages of the delta variant, it is crucial that all countries carry out sequencing of at least >1% of their infections, in order to detect emergence of variants with higher transmissibility and with ability to evade immunity. However, due to limited resources as many resource poor countries are unable to sequence adequate number of viruses, we compared to usefulness of a two-step commercially available multiplex real-time PCR assay to detect important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the variants and compared the sensitivity, accuracy and cost effectiveness of the Illumina sequencing platform and the Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) platform. 138/143 (96.5%) identified as the alpha and 36/39 (92.3%) samples identified as the delta variants due to the presence of lineage defining SNPs by the multiplex real time PCR, were assigned to the same lineage by either of the two sequencing platforms. 34/37 of the samples sequenced by ONT had <5% ambiguous bases, while 21/37 samples sequenced using Illumina generated <5%. However, the mean PHRED scores averaged at 32.35 by Illumina reads but 10.78 in ONT. This difference results in a base error probability of 1 in 10 by the ONT and 1 in 1000 for Illumina sequencing platform. Sub-consensus single nucleotide variations (SNV) are highly correlated between both platforms (R2 = 0.79) while indels appear to have a weaker correlation (R2 = 0.13). Although the ONT had a slightly higher error rate compared to the Illumina technology, it achieved higher coverage with a lower number or reads, generated less ambiguous bases and was significantly less expensive than Illumina sequencing technology."
https://openalex.org/W4226202553,"Olfactory identification disorder is regarded as an early marker of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and of similar diagnostic significance of biological or cognitive markers. Premature damage of the entorhinal olfactory cortex, the hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex characterize AD and suggest a specific impairment of olfactory identification. The use of psychophysical olfactory identification tests in clinical diagnostic practice is therefore strongly recommended, but not required. As these widespread tests are rarely used, an innovative test, adapted to this target group has been developed. It has been used and validated in a routine care protocol at different Memory Centers in France and in Quebec, Canada. A total of 157 participants were recruited: including 63 Alzheimer’s patients and 94 healthy controls. The test was composed of 14 odorants diluted into 4 different concentrations. A computer interface generated randomization of 6 odors per participant and the automatic calculation of identification scores, of perceptual thresholds and of composite scores. All participants underwent a Mini Mental Scale Examination within the previous three months or on the same day of the olfactory test. The Alzheimer’s patients had a score between 20 and 30 and healthy controls participants had a score above 28 without any loss of points on recalled items. The results show that our olfactory identification test is able to significantly differentiate Alzheimer’s patients from healthy controls (p &lt; 0.001), and to distinguish the French population tested from the Quebec population (p &lt; 0.001). This study highlights an olfactory identification disorder as a target for early diagnosis of AD. Its cultural qualities make it a potential candidate for differentiated calibration between France and Quebec."
https://openalex.org/W4225607476,"The 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic has not only created massive public health issues, it has also produced excessive psychological disorders in healthcare professionals, including radiology staff. The aim of this study is to assess the risk perception and mental health of radiology staff in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The researcher asked radiology staff to complete an online Google Forms questionnaire, between June 10, 2020 and June 17, 2020, which contained demographic data and self-designed questions related to anxiety, insomnia, depressive symptoms, and mental health services during the pandemic. A total of 168 radiology staff participated in the study. The results indicated that 53.05% and 57.14% of the participants were experiencing mild to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Moreover, 47.02% of the participants were experiencing insomnia symptoms. Among all the participants, only 16.61% had received psychological materials from their hospital during the pandemic, while 22.02% had accessed online psychological assistance techniques. The health of roughly one-third (30.95%) of the participants was worse than it had been before the pandemic. COVID-19 is a source of mental health disorders for healthcare professionals, particularly radiology staff. The findings of this study indicate that more than 70% of radiology staff in Saudi Arabia are concerned about insufficient protective measures and the risk of infection. In addition, a large percentage of them have experienced mental health disorders, such as anxiety, insomnia, and depression. Regular mental healthcare services are required to decrease the negative impact of the pandemic and enhance the overall mental health of the radiology staff."
https://openalex.org/W4225788815,"Potential association between oral levofloxacin use and hypoglycemic emergency (HE) have been established. However, a large epidemiological study is required to verify this observation. This study aimed to determine if use of oral levofloxacin increased the risk of HE. The nationwide database between 1999 and 2013, including 1.6 million patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), was used to conduct a nested case-control study. Cases and controls comprised of patients with and without HE, respectively. To avoid indication bias the control subjects were chosen through propensity score matching with cases in a 10-fold ratio. T2D severity was classified based on the adjusted diabetic complication severity index score. 26,695 and 266,950 matched patients with T2D, were finally used as cases and controls, respectively, for the analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that antibiotic use was associated with an increased risk for HE (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 6.08, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 5.79-6.38). When compared with antibiotic non-users, those who used fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides displayed the highest (aOR = 12.05, 95% CI: 10.66-13.61) and second highest (aOR = 7.20, 95% CI: 6.29-8.24) risks of HE, respectively. The associated risk for HE was significantly higher with levofloxacin than that with cephalosporins (aOR = 5.13, 95% CI: 2.28-11.52) and penicillin (aOR = 9.40, 95% CI: 2.25-39.24). In the joint effect analyses, the risk for HE increased with the combination of levofloxacin with insulin (aOR = 8.42, 95% CI: 1.91-37.00) or sulfonylurea (aOR = 3.56, 95% CI: 1.12-11.33). Use of oral levofloxacin, compared to that of other antibiotics, was found to be significantly associated with HE in T2D patients. Clinicians should exercise caution while prescribing levofloxacin, especially when combined with insulin or sulfonylurea."
https://openalex.org/W4225997929,"Identifying Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) phenotypes among middle-aged and older Hispanics/Latinos can facilitate personalized care, better inform treatment decisions, and could lead to improved clinical outcomes.We focused on middle-aged and older adults (ages ≥45-74 years at baseline) with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥5 from the HCHS/SOL (2008-2011) (unweighted n = 3,545). We used latent class analyses (LCA) to identify empirical and clinically meaningful OSA phenotypes. Sleep variables included AHI, percent sleep time SpO2<90%, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale (WHIIRS) score, self-reported average sleep duration, restless legs symptoms, napping frequency, and self-reported sleep quality. We used survey logistic and Poisson regression to test the associations between our OSA phenotypes and prevalent and incident cardiovascular measures (cardiovascular disease, heart failure, Stroke/TIA, hypertension, diabetes, and the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score).Average AHI, ESS, WHIIRS, and sleep duration were 18.1±19.5, 6.3±6.1, 7.4±6.6, and 7.8±1.7 hours, respectively, and 2.9% had zero percent time SpO2 <90%. We identified a three-class solution that clustered individuals into (1) insomnia OSA (44.3%), (2) asymptomatic mild OSA, (36.2%) and (3) symptomatic OSA (19.5%). Elevated WHIIRS and AHI scores primarily drove classification into groups one and three, respectively. In covariate adjusted models, OSA phenotypes were differentially associated with prevalence (baseline and seven years later) and incidence of cardiovascular measures.OSA subtypes in diverse U.S. Hispanic/Latino adults have different cardiovascular complications. More targeted research, that takes these variations into account, could help ameliorate Hispanic/Latino sleep and cardiovascular health disparities."

Residents, particularly, are already under undue stress due to their respective training program demands.This cross-sectional, online survey-based study from August to November 2020 collected demographic and mental health measurements from all residents at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi. The questionnaire investigated demographic variables, information regarding direct care of COVID-19 patients, prior history of mental health and mental health outcomes using the Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Impact of Event Scale-Revised Questionnaire and Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index Questionnaire.A total of 100 residents completed the survey (participation rate 77.5%). Participants were about equal in gender (women [53%]), with a median age of 31.28 years, and majority were single (66.7%). A total of 66 participants (66%) were directly engaged in COVID-19 care. Depression: 64.3%, anxiety: 51.5%, insomnia: 40.5%, distress: 35.4%, and burnout: 51.0% were reported in all participants. Statistical significance was found in median depression, professional fulfillment and interpersonal disengagement when comparing frontline resident directly involved in care of COVID-19 patient versus second line residents.Residents directly involved with caring for COVID-19 patients had statistically higher incidences of depression and interpersonal disengagement and lower professional fulfillment compared to second line residents.

https://openalex.org/W4220824650,"To assess the efficacy of Y-chromosome mini-STR-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) for non-invasive prenatal paternity testing (NIPPT).DNA was extracted from the plasma of 24 pregnant women, and cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) haplotyping was performed at 12 Y-chromosome mini-STR loci using the Illumina NextSeq 500 system. The cffDNA haplotype was validated by the paternal haplotype. Subsequentlly, the paternity testing parameters were attributed to each case quantitatively.The biological relationship between the alleged fathers and infants in all 24 family cases were confirmed by capillary electrophoresis (CE). The Y-chromosome mini-STR haplotypes of all 14 male cffDNA were obtained by NGS without any missing loci. The alleles of cffDNA and paternal genomic DNA were matched in 13 cases, and a mismatched allele was detected at the DYS393 locus in one case and considered as mutation. No allele was detected in the 10 female cffDNA. The combined paternity index (CPI) and probability of paternity calculation was based on 6 loci Y-haplotype distributions of a local population. The probability of paternity was 98.2699-99.8828% for the cases without mutation, and 14.8719% for the case harboring mutation.Our proof-of-concept study demonstrated that Y-chromosome mini-STR can be used for NGS-based NIPPT with high accuracy in real cases, and is a promising tool for familial searching, paternity exclusion and sex selection in forensic and medical applications."
https://openalex.org/W4220839309,"Phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) is a receptor-proximal enzyme that promotes signal transduction through PKC in mammalian cells. Because of the complexity of PLC-γ1 regulation, a two-state (inactive/active) model does not account for the intricacy of activation and inactivation steps at the plasma membrane. Here, we introduce a structure-based kinetic model of PLC-γ1, considering interactions of its regulatory Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and perturbation of those dynamics upon phosphorylation of Tyr783, a hallmark of activation. For PLC-γ1 phosphorylation to dramatically enhance enzyme activation as observed, we found that high intramolecular affinity of the C-terminal SH2 (cSH2) domain-pTyr783 interaction is critical, but this affinity need not outcompete the autoinhibitory interaction of the cSH2 domain. Under conditions for which steady-state PLC-γ1 activity is sensitive to the rate of Tyr783 phosphorylation, maintenance of the active state is surprisingly insensitive to the phosphorylation rate, since pTyr783 is well protected by the cSH2 domain while the enzyme is active. In contrast, maintenance of enzyme activity is sensitive to the rate of PLC-γ1 membrane (re)binding. Accordingly, we found that hypothetical PLC-γ1 mutations that either weaken autoinhibition or strengthen membrane binding influence the activation kinetics differently, which could inform the characterization of oncogenic variants. Finally, we used this newly informed kinetic scheme to refine a spatial model of PLC/PKC polarization during chemotaxis. The refined model showed improved stability of the polarized pattern while corroborating previous qualitative predictions. As demonstrated here for PLC-γ1, this approach may be adapted to model the dynamics of other receptor- and membrane-proximal enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W4220845199,"Adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR)-dependent signaling in macrophages plays a key role in the regulation of inflammation. However, the processes regulating A2AR targeting to the cell surface and degradation in macrophages are incompletely understood. For example, the C-terminal domain of the A2AR and proteins interacting with it are known to regulate receptor recycling, although it is unclear what role potential A2AR-interacting partners have in macrophages. Here, we aimed to identify A2AR-interacting partners in macrophages that may effect receptor trafficking and activity. To this end, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the C-terminal tail of A2AR as the ""bait"" and a macrophage expression library as the ""prey."" We found that the lysosomal protease cathepsin D (CtsD) was a robust hit. The A2AR-CtsD interaction was validated in vitro and in cellular models, including RAW 264.7 and mouse peritoneal macrophage (IPMΦ) cells. We also demonstrated that the A2AR is a substrate of CtsD and that the blockade of CtsD activity increases the density and cell surface targeting of A2AR in macrophages. Conversely, we demonstrate that A2AR activation prompts the maturation and enzymatic activity of CtsD in macrophages. In summary, we conclude that CtsD is a novel A2AR-interacting partner and thus describe molecular and functional interplay that may be crucial for adenosine-mediated macrophage regulation in inflammatory processes."
https://openalex.org/W4225497364,"We examined the role of eCIRP in the pathogenesis of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF).Publicly available gene expression omnibus datasets were analyzed for the expression of CIRP in lung samples from patients with PF. Wild type (WT) or CIRP-/- mice received daily injections of 10 μg/g bleomycin for 10 days. A subset of bleomycin-injected WT mice was treated with the eCIRP antagonist C23 (8 μg/g/day) from day 10 to day 19. At three weeks, transthoracic echocardiography was performed to measure the degree of pulmonary hypertension, and lung tissues were collected and analyzed for markers of fibrosis.Analysis of the mRNA data of human lung samples showed a significant positive correlation between CIRP and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), an important marker of fibrosis. Moreover, the expression of CIRP was higher in patients with acute exacerbation of PF than in patients with stable PF. CIRP-/- mice showed attenuated induction of α-SMA and collagens (Col1a1, Col3a1), reduced hydroxyproline content, decreased histological fibrosis scores, and improved pulmonary hypertension as compared to WT mice. WT mice treated with C23 also had significant attenuation of the above endpoint measure.Our study demonstrates that eCIRP plays a key role in promoting the development of PF, and blocking eCIRP with C23 can significantly attenuate this process."

https://openalex.org/W4226264060,"We performed geophysical and geoarchaeological investigations in the Wadden Sea off North Frisia (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany) to map the remains and to determine the state of preservation of the medieval settlement of Rungholt, especially its southern dyke segment, called the Niedam dyke. Based on archaeological finds and historical maps, Rungholt is assumed to be located in the wadden sea area around the island Hallig Südfall. During medieval and early modern times, extreme storm events caused major land losses, turning cultivated marshland into tidal flats. Especially the 1st Grote Mandrenke (or St. Marcellus' flood), an extreme storm surge event in 1362 AD, is addressed as the major event that flooded and destroyed most of the Rungholt cultural landscape. Cultural traces like remains of dykes, drainage ditches, tidal gates, dwelling mounds or even plough marks were randomly surveyed and mapped in the tidal flats by several authors at the beginning of the 20th century. Due to the tidal flat dynamics with frequently shifting tidal creeks and sand bars, the distribution of cultural remains visible at the surface is rapidly changing, making it hard to create a comprehensive map of the cultural landscape by surveying. Today, the Niedam dyke area is fully covered by tidal flat sediments, depriving any remains from further archaeological investigation. Since little is known about the precise location or state of preservation of these remains, our investigation aimed at the rediscovery of the medieval dyke system and associated structure with modern and accurate geophysical, geodetical and geoarchaeological methods. Magnetic gradiometry revealed a large part of the medieval dyke, confirming two tidal gates and several terps connected inland with the dyke, providing a detailed example of a Frisian medieval dyke system. Based on our results, the so far inaccurate and incomplete maps of this part of Rungholt can now be specified and completed. Beyond that, seismic reflection profiles give a first depth resolving insight in the remains of the dyke system, revealing a severe threat to the medieval remains by erosion. The site is exemplary for the entire North Frisian coast, that was influenced by multiple flood events in the middle ages to modern times."

The optimal threshold for differentiating between early and late recurrence was determined by the minimum p-value approach. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors for early recurrence.In 130 patients who developed recurrence after resection, 52 who had an initial recurrence within 12 months were defined as the early recurrence group, and the remaining 78 were defined as the late recurrence group. The incidence of hepatic recurrence was significantly higher in the early recurrence group than in the late recurrence group (39.7 vs. 15.4%). The early recurrence group had significantly lower 3-year rates of post-recurrence and overall survival than the late recurrence group (4.0 and 10.7% vs. 9.8 and 59.0%, respectively). Serum level of CA19-9 before surgery ≥56.8 U/ml was identified as an independent risk factor for early recurrence (OR:3.07, 95%CI:1.65-5.73, p<0.001) and associated with a significantly higher cumulative incidence rate of hepatic recurrence and lower rates of recurrence-free and overall survival.Serum level of CA19-9 before surgery after preoperative CRT was a strong predictive factor for early recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W4226361203,"Pediatric legislations in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) have increased medicines approved for use in the pediatric population. Despite many similarities between these frameworks, the EU Paediatric Regulation more often provides regulators with a mandate to require pediatric drug development for novel medicinal products compared to US regulators. If used, this could give rise to differences in the guidance for pediatric use provided for clinicians in the two regions. However, the level of discordance in the guidance for pediatric use between the two regions is unknown. This cross-sectional study compares guidance for pediatric use in the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and the US Prescription Information (USPI) on the level of indications granted for novel medicinal products approved after the pediatric legislations came in to force in both regions. For all indications granted as of March 2020 for novel medicinal products approved in both regions between 2010 and 2018, we compared the guidance for pediatric use in the EU SmPC and the USPI. The guidance for pediatric use differed for 18% (61/348) of the listed indications covering 21% (45/217) of the products, but without the guidance being contradictory. Where guidance differed, an equal share was observed for indications with a higher level of information for pediatric use in one region over the other (49% (30/61) in the US; 51% (31/61) in the EU). The discrepancies in pediatric information could be explained by differences in regulations for 21% (13/61) of the indications. Only a few conditions and diseases (EU n = 4; US n = 1) were observed to cover potential pediatric use outside the approved adult indication. Although the EU Paediatric Regulation more often provides regulators a mandate for requiring pediatric drug development as compared to the US PREA, this was not reflected in the prescription information approved by the two regulatory authorities."

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is a carbon source for building biomass in plants and microbes. In plants, RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), the most abundant enzyme on earth, catalyzes the first step in CO2 fixation (1Erb T.J.

Like GR, 2-KPCC is a homodimer with a redox active disulfide/FAD cofactor in each subunit. However, 2-KPCC has distinguishing features that appear to permit it to perform a carboxylation (3Clark D.D.

Specifically, typical DSORs have a conserved His-Glu catalytic dyad (4Rietveld P. Arscott L.D. Berry A. Scritton N.S. Deonarain M.P. Perham R.N. Williams Jr., C.H.

The conserved His serves as a source of protons during the catalytic cycle and stabilizes an important reaction intermediate. The conserved Glu moderates the sidechain orientation and pKa of the conserved His (4Rietveld P. Arscott L.D. Berry A. Scritton N.S. Deonarain M.P. Perham R.N. Williams Jr., C.H.

In 2-KPCC, this catalytic dyad is substituted by a Phe-His pair. Previous studies have shown that the Phe-His in 2-KPCC produces a unique reduced active form and facilitates carboxylation (8Streit B.R. Mattice J.R. Prussia G.A. Peters J.W. DuBois J.L. The reactive form of a C-S bond-cleaving, CO2-fixing flavoenzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 5137-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The reduced, reactive form of 2-KPCC reductively cleaves a thioether substrate 2-KPC (2-ketopropyl-coenzyme M). The product of this cleavage is an unstable enol-acetone anion, which as a nucleophile attacks enzyme-bound CO2 to form acetoacetate (Fig. 1B). In the absence of CO2 and in the presence of available protons, acetone forms as an undesirable side product. Therefore, 2-KPCC has a unique requirement, compared to GR, in that it must protect the enol-acetone intermediate from bulk solvent to produce the carboxylation product, acetoacetate (Fig. 1B) (1Erb T.J. Carboxylases in natural and synthetic microbial pathways.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77: 8466-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Prior work showed that the Phe of the Phe-His dyad suppresses protonation of the enol-acetone intermediate (9Prussia G.A. Gauss G.H. Mus F. Conner L. DuBois J.L. Peters J.W. Substitution of a conserved catalytic dyad into 2-KPCC causes loss of carboxylation activity.FEBS Lett. 2016; 590: 2991-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), while the His helps stabilize acetoacetate (10Prussia G.A.

The structure of 2-KPCC in the presence of substrates and intermediates reveals conformational shifts in which the substrate access channel has collapsed. This is mainly due to differences in the conformation of the aforementioned extended N and C termini and 13 amino acid insertion not present in GR. In the presence of substrates and intermediates, structures of 2-KPCC exist with a smaller hydrophobic channel that we have proposed facilitates the access of CO2 but excluding other molecules including aqueous solvent. We have hypothesized that this arrangement and implied conformation change is of key importance in protecting reaction intermediates promoting carboxylation and the formation of acetoacetate relative to protonation and the formation of the unproductive product acetone (5Nocek B. Jang S.B. Jeong M.S. Clark D.D. Ensign S.A. Peters J.W.

Experimental conditions include different ligand-bound and oxidation states of the enzyme. One condition of particular note is the oxidized enzyme and oxidized ligand complex, which was used to prevent product turnover and effectively explore the conformational changes reported in prior crystallographic work. Further, wildtype (WT) and amino acid–substituted variants of 2-KPCC in which one or both catalytic dyad residues (Phe501 and His506) are exchanged for the characteristic His-Glu pair found in GR were examined to determine whether the catalytic dyad, which promotes formation of the carboxylation product, might likewise play a role in producing conformational change. The evidence indeed indicates that 2-KPCC’s noncanonical Phe501-His506 active site dyad contributes to regulating dynamics associated with carboxylation. To begin a solution phase structural investigation of GR and 2-KPCC, NMS was conducted. In NMS, noncovalent interactions are maintained, facilitating an analysis of protein conformational changes upon ligand binding (13Tokmina-Lukaszewska M. Patterson A. Berry L. Scott L.

Soc. Rev. 2010; 39: 1633-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Solutions containing 5 μM GR or 2-KPCC with and without substrate (2 mM 2-KPC or glutathione disulfide (GSSG) intended to maximize the enzyme–substrate bound form) (15Janes W. Schulz G.E. The binding of the retro-analogue of glutathione disulfide to glutathione reductase.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10443-10445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared in 300 mM ammonium acetate and analyzed by direct infusion NMS. The charge state distributions of 2-KPCC in the presence and absence of 2-KPC indicated that 2-KPC narrowed the distribution of charge states and shifted it to a higher mass to charge (m/z) ratio (Fig. 3A). This suggests a more compact protein fold when 2-KPC is present. In contrast, GR exhibited no change in charge state distribution upon GSSG binding (Fig. 3A). IM coupled to NMS was then employed using the same experimental conditions. IM combines transfer time through an ion mobility cell and m/z to separate ions based on collisional cross section (CCS). Comparison of the observed CCS with values calculated from structural models provides information on protein conformation. Differences in protein conformation are detected as a change in CCS (13Tokmina-Lukaszewska M. Patterson A. Berry L. Scott L. Balasubramanian N. Bothner B. The role of mass spectrometry in structural studies of flavin-based electron bifurcating enzymes.Front. Microbiol. 2018; 9: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 14Uetrecht C. Rose R.J. Van Duijn E. Lorenzen K. Heck A.J.R. Ion mobility mass spectrometry of proteins and protein assemblies.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2010; 39: 1633-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). 2-KPCC in the absence of 2-KPC had a longer drift time than in its presence, corresponding to a larger CCS value for 2-KPCC in the absence of 2-KPC (Fig. 3A). Also, in the absence of substrate, 2-KPCC had a wider range of drift times, indicating a spread in the CCS which translates to a more diverse ensemble of conformations. This can be interpreted as greater conformational freedom in the absence of 2-KPC. In contrast, GR did not exhibit a shift in drift time with GSSG binding (Fig. 3A), giving strong evidence of no apparent difference in conformation. The IM-NMS data provided evidence for a substrate-dependent conformational change, but no information on its nature or location. To further our investigation, we used limited proteolysis to track the rate and location of kinetically favored sites of cleavage. The rate of proteolysis is expected to differ between dynamic and stable regions, with unstructured/dynamic regions of a protein exhibiting faster peptide bond hydrolysis (16Fontana A. Zambonin M. Polverino De Laureto P. De Filippis V. Clementi A. Scaramella E. Probing the conformational state of apomyoglobin by limited proteolysis.J. Mol.

Maturation of a tetravirus capsid alters the dynamic properties and creates a metastable complex.Virology. 2005; 334: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thermolysin was selected for this experiment because of the high frequency of potential cleavage sites in 2-KPCC (168) and GR (149) based on predicted sequence specificity (Fig. S1). Substrate binding can affect the rate and pattern of hydrolysis by changing accessibility to cleavable sites. Solutions of 2-KPCC and GR at 0.5 mg/ml were incubated with thermolysin at a 1:100 (wt:wt) ratio of protease to protein. To probe for substrate-induced conformational change, each enzyme was poised with different ligands (NADPH, 2-KPC, GSSG, and acetoacetate and NADP+). Aliquots were quenched for analysis at 0 min, 30 min, 2 h, and 5 h. The reaction was then visualized by SDS-PAGE. For WT 2-KPCC, there were significant differences in the cleavage kinetics and SDS-PAGE gel banding pattern depending on the ligand present (Fig. 4A). 2-KPCC in the absence of ligands was completely digested within 2 h: more rapidly than any of the conditions where a ligand was present. This suggests that the ligand-free state of the enzyme has the greatest conformational freedom. Further, the banding pattern on the gel suggests there are two primary sites of cleavage in the 2-KPCC 57 kDa monomer, termed sites 1 and 2. Cleavage at site 1 generates a band with an apparent molecular weight just slightly smaller than the parent protein (51 kDa), while cleavage at site 2 gives rise to a 42 kDa band (Fig. 4A). To identify the main proteolysis cleavage sites on 2-KPCC, solution phase LC-MS and in-gel digestion were employed. Both sites are found on the N terminus, site 1 was identified as amino acid A26 and site 2, which gives rise to the formation of the 42 kDa band, is F142 (Fig. 4B). The expected 9 kDa peptide accompanying the 42 kDa fragment was too small to be resolved by the SDS-PAGE experiment. In sharp contrast to the ligand-free state, the presence of 2-KPC dramatically slowed proteolysis. The intact protein was present throughout the 5 h incubation, with the 51 kDa band present after 2-h and the 42 kDa band not appearing at all. These data suggest that 2-KPC supplies substantial protection from proteolysis at both cleavage positions. Binding the products NADP+ and acetoacetate had very similar effects to 2-KPC, while in the NADPH present condition, the 42 kDa band appeared after 30 min and persisted to the 5-h time point. For GR, there was no significant change in cleavage kinetics or SDS-PAGE gel banding pattern upon substrate binding (Fig. 4C). In ligand-free, NADPH present, and GSSG present GR, the intact band was present at 5 h. GR did not exhibit change in proteolytic rate in the absence or presence of ligands, and this suggests little conformational flexibility regardless of ligand binding. Collectively, the limited proteolysis data indicate that 2-KPCC underwent ligand-induced conformational changes that restricted protease cleavage in the presence of 2-KPC, NADPH, or the acetoacetate/NADP+ products, while GR did not. The ligand-induced conformational changes seen in 2-KPCC also depend on the ligand present, suggesting that the conformational change undergone during reaction may follow an ordered change which will help protect the reaction intermediate. The limited proteolysis data revealed that substrate binding altered susceptibility to proteolysis. This inspired us to probe whether the same factors also influence global protein stability. To investigate this, we employed DSF to provide a read out of thermal stability of the proteins based on their melting profiles. A hydrophobic, fluorescent dye, which is quenched in a polar environment, is added to the protein solution. As the temperature is raised, the dye binds to hydrophobic pockets that become accessible as the protein structure denatures, producing a melting curve (18Rayaprolu V. Kruse S. Kant R.

Reaction solutions of 0.25 mg/ml 2-KPCC or GR were incubated with 50× concentration of Sypro Orange dye with or without substrate (0–5 mM). 2-KPCC has a thermal melting point (Tm) of 65.5 °C (Fig. 5A). Binding 2-KPC and NADPH shifted the Tm to 67 °C and 70.5 °C, respectively. This indicates that the ligands have a stabilizing effect on 2-KPCC. Increased thermal stability is consistent with a model in which the substrate-bound conformation can exclude solvent and a more compact structure is present. The stability and compact form arise from enhanced noncovalent interactions in the protein–ligand complex (20Niesen F.H. Berglund H. Vedadi M.

We would expect a more compact structure to have a higher Tm, like what is exhibited by binding of 2-KPC and NADPH. In contrast, binding of the reaction products acetoacetate and NADP+ lowered the Tm. This destabilization could characterize a product release form of 2-KPCC which was too small to be seen by limited proteolysis. Interestingly, GR has the highest Tm at 87 °C and exhibits no shift in Tm upon ligand binding but does exhibit a local destabilization at 72 °C (Fig. 5B). Together the IM-NMS, proteolysis, and thermal stability data reflect the crystallographic and catalytic models in which structural change is part of the catalytic cycle. The binding of different ligands produces different structural changes within 2-KPCC. These changes are not shared by GR, which has a high global thermal stability with none of the structural parameters interrogated here altered by substrate binding. To better elucidate the cause for 2-KPCC’s conformational changes compared to GRs static behavior, we wanted to explore amino acid–substituted variants of 2-KPCC in which one or both catalytic dyad residues (Phe501 and His506) are substituted by the characteristic His-Glu pair found in GR (Phe501His and/or His506Glu). Prior work showed that the Phe of the Phe-His dyad suppresses protonation of the enol-acetone intermediate (9Prussia G.A. Gauss G.H. Mus F. Conner L. DuBois J.L. Peters J.W. Substitution of a conserved catalytic dyad into 2-KPCC causes loss of carboxylation activity.FEBS Lett. 2016; 590: 2991-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), while the His helps stabilize the formation of acetoacetate (10Prussia G.A. Shisler K.A. Zadvornyy O.A. Streit B.R. DuBois J.L. Peters J.W. The unique Phe–His dyad of 2-ketopropyl coenzyme M oxidoreductase/carboxylase selectively promotes carboxylation and S–C bond cleavage.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297: 100961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). We now sought to determine if the catalytic dyad, which is essential for promoting formation of the carboxylation product, might likewise play a role in the conformational changes that are proposed to exclude solvent from the enol-acetone intermediate. To probe the structures of these variants, NMS and IM were employed in the presence and absence of 2-KPC. The charge state distributions of Phe501His, His506Glu, and Phe501His_His506Glu were lower than WT in the absence of 2-KPC, but not as low as WT in the presence of 2-KPC (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the WT enzyme, the variants did not have a shift in charge state upon addition of 2-KPC. The catalytic dyad of 2-KPCC promotes carboxylation and, when mutated, alters the product outcome (9Prussia G.A. Gauss G.H. Mus F. Conner L. DuBois J.L. Peters J.W. Substitution of a conserved catalytic dyad into 2-KPCC causes loss of carboxylation activity.FEBS Lett. 2016; 590: 2991-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 10Prussia G.A. Shisler K.A. Zadvornyy O.A. Streit B.R. DuBois J.L. Peters J.W. The unique Phe–His dyad of 2-ketopropyl coenzyme M oxidoreductase/carboxylase selectively promotes carboxylation and S–C bond cleavage.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297: 100961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Our results suggest a role for the unique catalytic dyad in carboxylation is manifested at least in part in transducing an essential conformational change. In the variants, the catalytic dyad stabilizes a more compact structure even without substrate. The 2-KPCC variants were also investigated in the presence and absence of 2-KPC (Fig. 3B). Importantly, they did not show a decrease in drift time with 2-KPC. However, they did exhibit a wider distribution of drift times. Taken with the NMS data, the variants appear to be in a conformation that closely resembles WT 2-KPCC in the presence of 2-KPC. This further implies that the Phe501His and His506Glu substitutions alter the conformational freedom of 2-KPCC. The 2-KPCC variants were also investigated by proteolysis. In the Phe501His variant, the ligand-free and NADPH present states exhibit lower proteolysis than WT (Fig. 6A), with the intact protein band persisting up to the 2 h time point. Addition of 2-KPC or NADPH extends the parent band lifetime to the 5 h mark and also stabilized the 42 kDa band so that it was likewise observable on this timescale. The His506Glu and the Phe501His_His506Glu reactions had intact protein remaining at the 2-h time point in all conditions and no observable 42 kDa species (Fig. 6, B and C). These results suggest that the His506Glu substitution stabilized the intact protein by limiting protease access to the helix that is cleaved to generate the 42 kDa form, but inhibited substrate-based protection. The active site residues Phe501 and His506 modulated protease access in 2-KPCC. When the active site was mutated to the canonical DSOR catalytic dyad residues, substrate-based protease protection was not observed in the variants with His506Glu substitution. This suggests that the protease-protective conformational changes could be the same as those needed for carboxylation. The His506Glu substitution appeared to alter conformational freedom more significantly than the Phe501His, as the substrate- and product-dependent modulation of protease access was not observed for this variant. The IM-NMS and limited proteolysis data demonstrated that the active site variants alter conformational freedom. We then employed DSF to investigate if the variants alter global protein stability. The ligand-free His506Glu variant has a decreased Tm relative to the WT and other variants, with a Tm of 57 °C (Fig. 7). The His506Glu variant exhibited small shifts to higher Tm upon binding of 2-KPC and NADPH and a slight shift to a lower Tm with acetoacetate and NADP+. This supports that the His506Glu substitution structure is possibly locked in a conformation not allowing for conformational freedom. Also, the melting temperatures of all conditions tested were similar to the acetoacetate and NADP+ condition of WT, which we interpret as the H506E substitution having a destabilizing effect on protein structure. The ligand free Phe501His and Phe501His_His506Glu variants have a similar Tm to WT with a Tm of 67 °C and 66 °C, respectively. However, the Phe501His variant did not have a large shift in Tm upon ligand binding except for with acetoacetate and NADP+ present, with a Tm of 71 °C. The Phe501His_His506Glu variant exhibited some hallmarks of both the single variants. A shoulder was present in some of the curves of Phe501His and Phe501His_His506Glu 2-KPCC. This shoulder suggests a local destabilization in the protein structure as the temperature is raised. Interestingly, GR shares this local destabilization. To further elucidate how these active site residues influence conformational change, we turned to a computational analysis using AlloSigMA (25Guarnera E. Tan Z.W. Zheng Z. Berezovsky I.N. AlloSigMA: Allosteric signaling and mutation analysis server.Bioinformatics. 2017; 33: 3996-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Guarnera E. Berezovsky I.N. Structure-based statistical mechanical model accounts for the causality and energetics of allosteric communication.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2016; 12: 1-27Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). AlloSigMA uses a structure-based statistical mechanical model of allostery to calculate the per-residue change in free energy for all possible protein configurations due to interactions with ligands or mutations (27Kurochkin I.V. Guarnera E. Wong J.H. Eisenhaber F. Berezovsky I.N. Toward allosterically increased catalytic activity of insulin-degrading enzyme against amyloid peptides.Biochemistry. 2017; 56: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Swain J.F. Gierasch L.M. The changing landscape of protein allostery.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). AlloSigMA defines the protein contact network of a protein by solving the structure-based statistical mechanical model of allostery for all possible local configurations in all available states. AlloSigMA defines mutations as either: UP-mutations, which cause over-stabilizing effects on the protein contact network, and DOWN-mutations, which cause destabilizing effects on a protein contact network (29Gunasekaran K. Ma B. Nussinov R. Is allostery an intrinsic property of all dynamic proteins?.Proteins. 2004; 57: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). To test the impact of an amino acid substitution at a specified position, the user selects the residue to be probed and the type of mutation to be modeled, UP or DOWN. This information is used to predict changes in allosteric communication across a protein model. Allostery, in its broadest sense, is the functional change at one site on a protein caused by a change at a distant site (28Swain J.F. Gierasch L.M. The changing landscape of protein allostery.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 29Gunasekaran K. Ma B. Nussinov R. Is allostery an intrinsic property of all dynamic proteins?.Proteins. 2004; 57: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 30Tee W.V. Guarnera E. Berezovsky I.N. Reversing allosteric communication: From detecting allosteric sites to inducing and tuning targeted allosteric response.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2018; 14: 1-26Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). AlloSigMA interprets allostery as a change at any site in the structure that can lead to a shift in occupancy of the conformational states in which the protein can exist. The crystal structure of 2-KPCC (PDB: 1MOK) was explored using AlloSigMA, where the Phe-His dyad was singly or doubly mutated to a DOWN-mutation (destabilizing residue). AlloSigMA then calculated the per-residue change in allosteric free energy (kcal/mol) caused by the mutation. A positive change in allosteric free energy indicates a change in force acting on the residue because of the mutation, and it can be interpreted as a possible increase in dynamics that could lead to a conformational change (31Tan Z.W. Guarnera E. Tee W.V. Berezovsky I.N. AlloSigMA 2: Paving the way to designing allosteric effectors and to exploring allosteric effects of mutations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: W116-W124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A negative change in allosteric free energy indicates a stabilization of the residue caused by the mutation and possibly preventing conformational change or a decrease in dynamics. DOWN-mutations at Phe501, His506, and Phe501_His506 revealed an increase in free energy in the active site while the rest of the protein structure had a decrease in free energy. These values were color coded positive (red) or negative (blue) and displayed on the protein sequence or the structure (Fig. 8). These results are interpreted as an increase in conformational flexibility, where the number of possible conformational states is increased in the active site and a decrease in the rest of the protein. This was exhibited by all three variants, but the most prominent changes were seen in His506. A control experiment was conducted by mutating noncatalytically active residues in the active site and surface of the protein. These mutations produced very little change in free energy (Fig. S2). GR was also explored by AlloSigMA with mutations to the His-Glu catalytic dyad (Fig. S3). Interestingly, single substitutions at either residue produced similar behavior to 2-KPCC, where the active site showed an increase in free energy while the rest of the protein had a decrease. Tandem substitutions exhibited an increase in free energy near the active site. This further supports that the active site catalytic dyad has an important role in modulating conformational change in 2-KPCC and differences between the 2-KPCC and canonical DSOR enzymes such as GR. Taken together, the DSF, limited proteolysis, IM-NMS data, and AlloSigMA analyses support a functional model of catalysis in which 2-KPCC transitions between multiple conformations, the equilibrium of which is controlled by substrate and product. The IM-NMS data showed a change in conformation of 2-KPCC when 2-KPC was present, and that active site substitutions altered the conformational ensemble of 2-KPCC. Limited proteolysis allowed us to localize conformational change upon binding of substrates and products to the N terminus. A change we believe serves to exclude solvent from the active site (see Fig. 2D). A key finding of this work is the role of the catalytic dyad (Phe-His) in the modulation of 2-KPCC’s conformational ensemble. DSF and AlloSigMA contributed significantly to this conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W4220793620,"The periodic breakdowns of stripe rust resistance due to emergence of new virulent and more aggressive pathotypes of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici have resulted in severe epidemics in India. This necessitates the search for new and more durable resistance sources against stripe rust. The three bread wheat cultivars PBW 343 (carries Yr9 and Yr27), PBW 621 (carries Yr17) and HD 2967 (gene not known) were highly popular among the farmers after their release in 2011. But presently all three cultivars are highly susceptible to stripe rust at seedling as well as at adult plant stages as their resistance has been broken down due to emergence of new pathotypes of the pathogen (110S119, 238S119). In previous study, the crosses of PBW 621 with PBW 343 and HD 2967 and evaluation of further generations (up to F4) against pathotype 78S84 resulted in resistant segregants. In the present study, the F5 and F6 RIL populations have been evaluated against new pathotypes of Pst. The RILs categorized based on the disease severity on the P (Penultimate leaf) and F (flag) leaf into three categories i.e., high, moderate and low level of APR (adult plant resistance) having 1-200, 201-400 and >400 values of AUDPC, respectively, upon infection with stripe rust. The various APR components (latent period, lesion growth rate, spore production and uredial density) were studied on each category, i.e., resistant, moderately resistant and susceptible. The values of APR parameters decreased as the level of resistance increased. Based on molecular analysis, the lines (representing different categories of cross PBW 621 X PBW 343) containing the genes Yr9 and Yr17 due to their interactive effect provide resistance. Based on BSA using 35k SNPs and KASP markers association with phenotypic data of the RIL population (PBW 621 X HD 2967) showed the presence of two QTLs (Q.Pst.pau-6B, Q.Pst.pau-5B) responsible for the residual resistance and two SNPs AX-94891670 and AX-94454107 were found to be associated with the trait of interest on chromosome 6B and 5B respectively. The present study concludes that in the population of both the crosses (PBW 621 X PBW 343 and PBW 621 X HD 2967) major defeated gene contributed towards residual resistance by interacting with minor gene/QTLs."

To date there are no consistently reliable means to accurately identify truly high versus low-risk patient subpopulations. There is hence an urgent need for more accurate prediction of prognosis to determine appropriate clinical management. Validation of a novel prognostic test based on the immunohistochemical expression of two protein biomarkers in the epidermal microenvironment of primary melanomas was undertaken; loss of these biomarkers had previously been shown to be associated with a higher risk of recurrence or metastasis. A parallel qualitative study exploring secondary care health professional and patient views of the test was undertaken and this paper reports the perceived barriers and enablers to its implementation into the melanoma care pathway.Qualitative methods were employed drawing upon the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) in the exploration and analysis. An inductive-deductive analysis was performed, with all data coded using a thematic then TDF framework.20 dermatologists, plastic surgeons, cancer nurse specialists, oncologists and histopathologists participated. Nine TDF domains were relevant to all health professional groups and the 'Skills' and 'Beliefs about Capabilities' domains were relevant only to histopathologists. 'Optimism' and 'Beliefs about consequences' were strong enablers particularly for clinicians. 'Environmental context and resources' (impact on pathology services) and 'Knowledge' (the need for robust evidence about the test reliability) were the main perceived barriers. 19 patients and one carer were interviewed. For the patients eight domains were relevant. ('Knowledge', 'Emotions', 'Beliefs about consequences', 'Social Role and identity', 'Behavioural regulation', 'Memory, attention and decision processes', 'Reinforcement' and 'Skills'). The consequences of the implementation of the test were reassurance about future risk, changes to the follow-up pathway on which there were mixed views, and the need to ensure they maintained self-surveillance (Beliefs about consequences). The test was acceptable to all patient interviewees but the resultant changes to management would need to be supported by mechanisms for fast-track back into the clinic, further information on self-surveillance and clear management plans at the time the result is conveyed (Behavioural regulation).Health professionals and patients perceived positive consequences-for patients and for health services-of adopting the test. However, its implementation would require exploration of the resource implications for pathology services, psychological support for patients with a high-risk test result and mechanisms to reassure and support patients should the test lead to reduced frequency or duration of follow-up. Exploring implementation at an early stage with health professionals presented challenges related to the provision of specific details of the test and its validation."

I illustrate that neutral mechanisms can be easily computed by the tractable set of conditions with straightforward interpretations for a class of public goods problems. I show that, unlike neutral mechanisms, ex ante incentive efficient mechanisms are not robust to a perturbation of the information structure at the time of mechanism selection. I highlight several merits of using neutral mechanisms instead of interim incentive efficient mechanisms: Neutral mechanisms yield sharp predictions, are invulnerable to the possibility of information leakage during the selection process, and have the attractive properties of both efficiency and equity. I discuss implications for the analysis of ex ante and interim incentive efficient mechanisms for public goods problems."

Claims were excluded if the patient had a prior catheterization in 2018, had any indications of CABG or valvular heart disease in the prior year of claims, or if the provider had ≤10 catheterization claims in 2017. Downstream PCI and CABG were determined by examining claims 0-30 days post-catheterization. Using multivariate mixed effects logistic regression with provider identity random effects, the association between post-catheterization procedures and provider characteristics was assessed, controlling for patient characteristics.The sample consisted of 31,920 catheterization claims pertaining to procedures performed by 964 providers. Among the catheterization claims, 8,554 (26.8%) were followed by PCI and 1,779 (5.6%) were followed by CABG. Catheterizations performed by providers with older prior year patient cohorts were associated with higher adjusted odds of PCI (1.78; CI: 1.26-2.53), even after controlling for patient age. Catheterizations performed by providers with greater historic use of FFR had significantly higher adjusted odds of being followed by PCI (1.73; CI: 1.26-2.37).Provider characteristics may impact whether patients receive a procedure post-catheterization. Further research is needed to characterize this relationship."
https://openalex.org/W4225644362,"Grassland birds in North America face many problems as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation; understanding their habitat requirements is critical for their conservation and management. The sharp-tailed grouse ( Tympanuchus phasianellus ) can be found throughout North American grasslands and is a species of economic and cultural importance, but it has experienced population declines over the last few decades. A large part of sharp-tailed grouse life history is focused on and around lekking grounds, which makes leks an essential feature for sharp-tailed grouse management. We used information from 596 leks and landcover predictors within 1-km and 5-km squares to perform Habitat Suitability Index modeling for sharp-tailed grouse on the Northern Great Plains in Saskatchewan, Canada. The proportion of grasslands at the 5-km scale and the 1-km scale were the two most important factors affecting lek occurrence (permutation importance = 34.8% and 26.9%, respectively). In every case, the 5-km scale predictors were ranked as having a more significant influence on lek occurrence than the 1-km scale. Other factors of importance included topographic roughness (9.7% permutation importance), and the proportion of human disturbance at the 5-km scale (5% permutation importance). Our study highlights the importance of large patches of grassland to support the occurrence of sharp-tailed grouse leks, and that a diverse set of habitat features are needed for sharp-tailed grouse management."

This study was designed to determine whether potato almond orange cookies increase weight, hemoglobin, and albumin) in undernourished preschool-aged children during the COVID-19 pandemic. A pre-post intervention study was conducted with 30 subjects during 8 weeks in which hemoglobin and albumin levels were recorded at the beginning and end. Education on balanced nutrition was provided to mothers using leaflets, flipcharts, and videos. The results showed increases in weight (0.4 kg), height (1.98 cm), hemoglobin level (0.1 g/dL), and albumin level (0.1 g/dL) accompanied by a significant increase in weight, height, and the Z-score index for weight for age, whereas those for Hb and albumin levels were not. Energy, carbohydrate, fat, vitamin C, vitamin E, and iron intake increased significantly. Further, there was a significant difference in mothers' knowledge of balanced nutrition and COVID-19 at the end of the study. Thus, high levels of cookie consumption increased the weight of underweight preschool-aged children. Future studies may wish to consider examining the issue using stunted, wasted, and anemic preschool-aged children as the research subjects."

However, there is a lack of CDC. This study builds a set of no-notice drill mode evaluation systems for public health emergencies that involve the CDC.The indexes for these systems were based on the performance of two no-notice drills for public health emergencies in Guangdong Province. Twenty experts were invited to screen the indicators during two rounds of the Delphi method to determine the weight of first- and second-level indexes through the analytic hierarchy process, and the weight of the third-level index was calculated using the percentage method.After two rounds of expert consultation, we obtained four first-level indicators, twenty-six second-level indicators and eighty-six third-level indicators. According to the weight calculated by analytic hierarchy process, the weights of the first-level indicators are emergency preparation (0.2775), verification and consultation regarding an epidemic situation (0.165), field investigation and control (0.3925) and summary report (0.165). Sensitivity analysis shows that the stability of the index is good.The no-notice drill mode evaluation system for public health emergencies constructed in this study can be applied to public health departments such as the CDC.

https://openalex.org/W4226338119,"Formulation of solid dispersions (SDs), in which the drug substance is dissolved or dispersed inside a polymer matrix, is one of the modern approaches to increase the solubility and dissolution rate of poorly soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), such as clopidogrel. In the form of a free base, clopidogrel is unstable under increased both high moisture and temperature, so it is most often used as its salt form, clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate (CHS).The aim of this study was the formulation, characterization, and long-term stability investigation of CHS solid dispersions, prepared with four different hydrophilic polymers (poloxamer 407, macrogol 6000, povidone, copovidone) in five API/polymer ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:5, 1:9). SDs were prepared by the solvent evaporation method, employing ethanol (96% v/v) as a solvent. Initial results of the in vitro dissolution test showed an increase in the amount of dissolved CHS from all prepared SD samples compared to pure CHS, corresponding physical mixtures (PMs), and commercial tablets. SDs, prepared with poloxamer 407, macrogol 6000, and copovidone, at CHS/polymer ratios 1:5 and 1:9, notably increased the amount of dissolved CHS (> 80%, after 60 min), thus they were selected for further characterization. To assess the SDs long-term stability, in vitro dissolution studies, clopidogrel content determination, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were performed initially and after 12 months of long-term stability studies under controlled conditions (25°C, 60% RH) meeting the ICH guideline Q1A (R2) requirements. The clopidogrel content in the selected samples was very similar at the beginning (96.13% to 99.93%) and at the end (95.98% to 99.86%) of the conducted test. DSC curves and FT-IR spectra of all SD samples after 12 months of stability study, showed the absence of CHS crystallization, which is an indication of good stability. However, the in vitro dissolution test showed a considerable reduction in CHS released from SDs with macrogol 6000. The amount of dissolved CHS from SDs with macrogol 6000 was initially 94.02% and 92.01%, and after 12 months of stability study, only 65.13% and 49.62%. In contrast, the amount of dissolved CHS from SDs prepared with poloxamer 407 and copovidone was very similar after 12 months of the stability study compared to the initial values. Results obtained indicated the great importance of the in vitro dissolution test in determining the long-term stability and quality of SDs."
