https://openalex.org/W1702559537,"Manipulating a stubborn magnet Spintronics is an alternative to conventional electronics, based on using the electron's spin rather than its charge. Spintronic devices, such as magnetic memory, have traditionally used ferromagnetic materials to encode the 1's and 0's of the binary code. A weakness of this approach—that strong magnetic fields can erase the encoded information—could be avoided by using antiferromagnets instead of ferromagnets. But manipulating the magnetic ordering of antiferromagnets is tricky. Now, Wadley et al. have found a way (see the Perspective by Marrows). Running currents along specific directions in the thin films of the antiferromagnetic compound CuMnAs reoriented the magnetic domains in the material. Science , this issue p. 587 ; see also p. 558"

The role of this R-loop structure in positioning each DNA strand for cleavage by the two Cas9 nuclease domains is unknown. We determine molecular structures of the catalytically active Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 R-loop that show the displaced DNA strand located near the RuvC nuclease domain active site. These protein-DNA interactions, in turn, position the HNH nuclease domain adjacent to the target DNA strand cleavage site in a conformation essential for concerted DNA cutting. Cas9 bends the DNA helix by 30°, providing the structural distortion needed for R-loop formation."

Substantial effort has thus been directed toward developing KRAS inhibitors. KRAS encodes an enzyme that binds the nucleotide GTP and hydrolyzes it to GDP. It had been thought that oncogenic mutations disable this hydrolytic activity, locking KRAS in the GTP-bound, active state. Surprisingly, Lito et al. found that a certain KRAS mutant (G12C) retains hydrolytic activity and continues to cycle between its active and inactive states. They describe a compound that inhibits KRAS(G12C) signaling and tumor cell growth by binding to the GDPbound form of KRAS, trapping it in its inactive state. Science , this issue p. 604"

https://openalex.org/W2267531769,"The position of Xenacoelomorpha in the tree of life remains a major unresolved question in the study of deep animal relationships. Xenacoelomorpha, comprising Acoela, Nemertodermatida, and Xenoturbella, are bilaterally symmetrical marine worms that lack several features common to most other bilaterians, for example an anus, nephridia, and a circulatory system. Two conflicting hypotheses are under debate: Xenacoelomorpha is the sister group to all remaining Bilateria (= Nephrozoa, namely protostomes and deuterostomes) or is a clade inside Deuterostomia. Thus, determining the phylogenetic position of this clade is pivotal for understanding the early evolution of bilaterian features, or as a case of drastic secondary loss of complexity. Here we show robust phylogenomic support for Xenacoelomorpha as the sister taxon of Nephrozoa. Our phylogenetic analyses, based on 11 novel xenacoelomorph transcriptomes and using different models of evolution under maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses, strongly corroborate this result. Rigorous testing of 25 experimental data sets designed to exclude data partitions and taxa potentially prone to reconstruction biases indicates that long-branch attraction, saturation, and missing data do not influence these results. The sister group relationship between Nephrozoa and Xenacoelomorpha supported by our phylogenomic analyses implies that the last common ancestor of bilaterians was probably a benthic, ciliated acoelomate worm with a single opening into an epithelial gut, and that excretory organs, coelomic cavities, and nerve cords evolved after xenacoelomorphs separated from the stem lineage of Nephrozoa."
https://openalex.org/W2269030342,"Using single-molecule fluorescence imaging of photoelectrocatalysis, the charge-carrier activities on single TiO2 nanorods and the corresponding water-oxidation photocurrent are mapped at high spatiotemporal resolution, revealing the best catalytic sites and the most effective sites for depositing an oxygen evolution catalyst. The photoelectrochemical cleavage of water into hydrogen and oxygen is a promising solar-to-fuel energy conversion technology. Attempts to make the process more efficient usually require the photoanodes to be modified with an oxygen evolution catalyst, but little information is available to inform this process. Justin Sambur et al. use in operando imaging, with unprecedented resolution, to map the photoelectrocatalytic activities on single TiO2 nanorods. The data show which photoanode sites are active, and reveal which catalyst deposition sites enhance or worsen performance and why. The methods used are applicable to a wide range of material systems, and should enable the rational, activity-based development of improved catalyst-modified photoelectrodes for solar energy conversion. The splitting of water photoelectrochemically into hydrogen and oxygen represents a promising technology for converting solar energy to fuel1,2. The main challenge is to ensure that photogenerated holes efficiently oxidize water, which generally requires modification of the photoanode with an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) to increase the photocurrent and reduce the onset potential3. However, because excess OEC material can hinder light absorption and decrease photoanode performance4, its deposition needs to be carefully controlled—yet it is unclear which semiconductor surface sites give optimal improvement if targeted for OEC deposition, and whether sites catalysing water oxidation also contribute to competing charge-carrier recombination with photogenerated electrons5. Surface heterogeneity6 exacerbates these uncertainties, especially for nanostructured photoanodes benefiting from small charge-carrier transport distances1,7,8. Here we use super-resolution imaging9,10,11,12,13, operated in a charge-carrier-selective manner and with a spatiotemporal resolution of approximately 30 nanometres and 15 milliseconds, to map both the electron- and hole-driven photoelectrocatalytic activities on single titanium oxide nanorods. We then map, with sub-particle resolution (about 390 nanometres), the photocurrent associated with water oxidation, and find that the most active sites for water oxidation are also the most important sites for charge-carrier recombination. Site-selective deposition of an OEC, guided by the activity maps, improves the overall performance of a given nanorod—even though more improvement in photocurrent efficiency correlates with less reduction in onset potential (and vice versa) at the sub-particle level. Moreover, the optimal catalyst deposition sites for photocurrent enhancement are the lower-activity sites, and for onset potential reduction the optimal sites are the sites with more positive onset potential, contrary to what is obtainable under typical deposition conditions. These findings allow us to suggest an activity-based strategy for rationally engineering catalyst-improved photoelectrodes, which should be widely applicable because our measurements can be performed for many different semiconductor and catalyst materials."
https://openalex.org/W2271221047,"Historical assessment of nectar provision in the UK from the 1930s to 2007 shows an initial dramatic fall, but more recently nectar provision has increased; the diversity of nectar sources has fallen to the point that four species now produce half of the total UK nectar. There is widespread concern about recent declines in bees, butterflies and other insect pollinators. Declines in flowers have been suggested as a key cause, but the idea has not been fully tested until now. Mathilde Baude et al. provide a UK national-level assessment of a key resource on which pollinators depend — nectar. They determine the nectar value of most common British plants, and assess nectar production in 260 plant species, combining the data with historical vegetation surveys. The results show that total nectar resources declined in England and Wales between the 1930s and 1970s before stabilizing and then increased more recently, but the diversity of species providing the nectar kept declining for a further decade after that. By 2007, just four grassland plant species accounted for more than half of the national nectar provision. These trends mirror pollinator diversity, which declined in the mid-twentieth century but stabilized more recently. Small adjustments to the management cycle of improved grasslands, allowing white clover (the dominant resource species) to flower would increase nectar availability, although only a subset of pollinator species would benefit. There is considerable concern over declines in insect pollinator communities and potential impacts on the pollination of crops and wildflowers1,2,3,4. Among the multiple pressures facing pollinators2,3,4, decreasing floral resources due to habitat loss and degradation has been suggested as a key contributing factor2,3,4,5,6,7,8. However, a lack of quantitative data has hampered testing for historical changes in floral resources. Here we show that overall floral rewards can be estimated at a national scale by combining vegetation surveys and direct nectar measurements. We find evidence for substantial losses in nectar resources in England and Wales between the 1930s and 1970s; however, total nectar provision in Great Britain as a whole had stabilized by 1978, and increased from 1998 to 2007. These findings concur with trends in pollinator diversity, which declined in the mid-twentieth century9 but stabilized more recently10. The diversity of nectar sources declined from 1978 to 1990 and thereafter in some habitats, with four plant species accounting for over 50% of national nectar provision in 2007. Calcareous grassland, broadleaved woodland and neutral grassland are the habitats that produce the greatest amount of nectar per unit area from the most diverse sources, whereas arable land is the poorest with respect to amount of nectar per unit area and diversity of nectar sources. Although agri-environment schemes add resources to arable landscapes, their national contribution is low. Owing to their large area, improved grasslands could add substantially to national nectar provision if they were managed to increase floral resource provision. This national-scale assessment of floral resource provision affords new insights into the links between plant and pollinator declines, and offers considerable opportunities for conservation."

https://openalex.org/W2257485841,"The G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4 generates signals that lead to cell migration, cell proliferation, and other survival mechanisms that result in the metastatic spread of primary tumor cells to distal organs. Numerous studies have demonstrated that CXCR4 can form homodimers or can heterodimerize with other G-protein-coupled receptors to form receptor complexes that can amplify or decrease the signaling capacity of each individual receptor. Using biophysical and biochemical approaches, we found that CXCR4 can form an induced heterodimer with cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) in human breast and prostate cancer cells. Simultaneous, agonist-dependent activation of CXCR4 and CB2 resulted in reduced CXCR4-mediated expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and ultimately reduced cancer cell functions such as calcium mobilization and cellular chemotaxis. Given that treatment with cannabinoids has been shown to reduce invasiveness of cancer cells as well as CXCR4-mediated migration of immune cells, it is plausible that CXCR4 signaling can be silenced through a physical heterodimeric association with CB2, thereby inhibiting subsequent functions of CXCR4. Taken together, the data illustrate a mechanism by which the cannabinoid system can negatively modulate CXCR4 receptor function and perhaps tumor progression.

However, as evidenced by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, simultaneous treatment with both agonists promoted the formation of CXCR4/δ-opioid receptor heterodimers that, although unable to signal, still retained the ability to bind their respective agonists (58.Pello O.M.

In the present study, we hypothesized that CXCR4-mediated functions can be abrogated by simultaneous, agonist-induced heterodimerization of CXCR4 with CB2, leading to an overall attenuation of cell metastasis and ultimately progression of tumors. To this end, we analyzed a physical heterodimeric association between CXCR4 and CB2, cellular migration, and subsequent biological functions upon simultaneous stimulation by their respective ligands. Our results complement other reported model systems in which the formation of a heterodimerized GPCR receptor complex attenuated downstream functions that would otherwise result from individually signaling receptors.

Samples were passed through a 25-gauge needle 15 times, and then equal amounts of protein were incubated with an anti-CXCR4 antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to samples for an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Alternatively, 30 μg of whole cell lysate per sample were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE to demonstrate that equal amounts of CXCR4 were immunoprecipitated from samples; this served as input. After immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were separated from the protein-bead complexes by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) and saved as supernatant; supernatant was used to demonstrate that CB2 was immunoprecipitated from samples.

https://openalex.org/W2253798252,"Understanding animal movement decisions that involve migration is critical for evaluating population connectivity, and thus persistence. Recent work on sharks has shown that often only a portion of the adult population will undertake migrations, while the rest may be resident in an area for long periods. Defining the extent to which adult sharks use specific habitats and their migratory behaviour is essential for assessing their risk of exposure to threats such as fishing and habitat degradation. The present study used acoustic telemetry to examine residency patterns and migratory behaviour of adult bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) along the East coast of Australia. Fifty-six VR2W acoustic receivers were used to monitor the movements of 33 bull sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Both males and females were detected year-round, but their abundance and residency peaked between September and December across years (2012-2014). High individual variability in reef use patterns was apparent, with some individuals leaving the array for long periods, whereas others (36%) exhibited medium (0.20-0.40) or high residency (> 0.50). A large portion of the population (51%) undertook migrations of up to 1,400 km to other coral reefs and/or inshore coastal habitats in Queensland and New South Wales. Most of these individuals (76%) were mature females, and the timing of migrations coincided with the austral summer (Dec-Feb). All migrating individuals (except one) returned to the central GBR, highlighting its importance as a potential foraging ground. Our findings suggest that adult bull sharks appear to be highly dependent on coral reef resources and provide evidence of partial migration, where only a portion of the female population undertook seasonal migrations potentially to give birth. Given that estuarine habitats face constant anthropogenic pressures, understanding partial migration and habitat connectivity of large coastal predators should be a priority for their management."
https://openalex.org/W2267652611,"Mice produce ultrasonic vocalizations featuring a variety of syllables. Vocalizations are observed during social interactions. In particular, males produce numerous syllables during courtship. Previous studies have shown that vocalizations change according to sexual behavior, suggesting that males vary their vocalizations depending on the phase of the courtship sequence. To examine this process, we recorded large sets of mouse vocalizations during male-female interactions and acoustically categorized these sounds into 12 vocal types. We found that males emitted predominantly short syllables during the first minute of interaction, more long syllables in the later phases, and mainly harmonic sounds during mounting. These context- and time-dependent changes in vocalization indicate that vocal communication during courtship in mice consists of at least three stages and imply that each vocalization type has a specific role in a phase of the courtship sequence. Our findings suggest that recording for a sufficiently long time and taking the phase of courtship into consideration could provide more insights into the role of vocalization in mouse courtship behavior in future study."

Obesity is characterized by excess adipose tissue mass, and it is associated with various chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Obesity is currently one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally. There are two different types of adipose tissues in mammals: white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue. White adipose tissue (WAT) 2The abbreviations used are: WAT, white adipose tissue(s); BAT, brown adipose tissue; CM-H2DCFDA, chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; BHA, butylated hydroxyanisole; MaTBAP, Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; OCR, oxygen consumption rate; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; ANOVA, analysis of variance; RNA-seq, RNA sequencing. serves an important role in maintaining energy homeostasis in the body by storing surplus energy as triglyceride and releasing free fatty acids to meet the needs of other organs when energy intake is less than energy expenditure. White adipocytes contain few mitochondria and are characterized by a single, large lipid droplet. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized in energy consumption through heat production in response to cold or excess calories. This response, known as adaptive thermogenesis, protects against cold exposure and plays a beneficial role in regulating energy balance in mice that have a variable diet (1.Lowell B.B.

Cellular bioenergetics as a target for obesity therapy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 465-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Brown adipocytes contain multiple small lipid droplets and are highly enriched in mitochondria. In humans, BAT is abundant in newborns, and it was originally thought to be nonexistent or nonfunctional in adults. However, recent studies have shown metabolically active BAT in adult humans through the use of PET/CT scans (positron emission tomography associated with computed tomography) (3.Cohade C. Osman M.

The thermogenic function of BAT is dependent on UCP1, a protein expressed in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown fat cells that functions to dissipate the proton gradient generated during oxidative phosphorylation. This is achieved by increasing the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane, allowing protons that have been pumped into the intermembrane space to return to the mitochondrial matrix. This proton leak, termed mitochondrial uncoupling, is physiologically relevant, accounting for 20–25% of the basal metabolic rate (12.Porter R.K.

Conversely, transgenic mice with increased Ucp1 expression in WAT are resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity (16.Kopecky J. Clarke G. Enerbäck S. Spiegelman B. Kozak L.P.

In addition, transgenic mice expressing Ucp1 in skeletal muscle showed improved glucose tolerance after being fed a high fat diet when compared with wild type mice (17.Li B. Nolte L.A. Ju J.S.

Med. 2000; 6: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In humans, it has been estimated that as little as 50 g of BAT (<0.1% of body weight) could utilize up to 20% of basal caloric needs if maximally stimulated (2.Tseng Y.H. Cypess A.M. Kahn C.R. Cellular bioenergetics as a target for obesity therapy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 465-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Because of the enormous thermogenic capacity of BAT, there has been intense interest in the determinants of BAT function and the potential for treating obesity by manipulating BAT function. In addition to brown adipose tissue, several studies have shown that brown-like adipocytes (often referred to as “brite” or “beige” adipocytes) occur in some classical white adipose depots as well as skeletal muscle and that these serve as extremely promising targets for treatment of obesity (18.Barbatelli G.

NRF2 is able to form heterodimers with other transcription factors, including sMAF (small Maf proteins), JUND, and ATF4 (activation transcription factor 4), to bind and activate gene transcription via cis-acting antioxidant response elements in the promoters of cellular defense genes (27.Giudice A.

In addition, mice lacking Nrf2 demonstrate a resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity, but the underlying mechanism is not clear (41.Pi J. Leung L. Xue P. Wang W. Hou Y. Liu D. Yehuda-Shnaidman E.

Specifically, we assessed energy expenditure, changes in adipose tissue mass, morphology, and gene expression in Nrf2−/− mice fed both a normal and high fat diet. In addition, Nrf2−/− cells were assessed for mitochondrial function and gene expression. Our studies are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress modulates mitochondrial function to control fat storage and energy expenditure in Nrf2 knock-outs. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), α-minimum essential medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, CM-H2DCFDA, MitoTracker Green FM, nanoyl-acridine orange, and Superscript III reverse transcriptase were purchased from Invitrogen.

UCP1 (ab23841) antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). α-Tubulin antibody (ab3873) was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). TRIzol RNA reagent, 2× FastStart SYBR Green Master mix, was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The RNeasy MinElute cleanup kit was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit was from Pierce. Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride (MnTBAP) was purchased from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated as described previously (41.Pi J. Leung L. Xue P. Wang W. Hou Y. Liu D. Yehuda-Shnaidman E. Lee C. Lau J. Kurtz T.W. Chan J.Y.

Oxidative stress was induced in cells by incubating with 25 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase for 6 h at 37 °C, and antioxidant treatment was accomplished by incubation with 40 μm BHA or with 10 μm MnTBAP. All experiments were carried out following guidelines of the University of California Irvine institutional animal care and use committee. Nrf2 knock-out mice have been described previously (42.Chan K. Lu R. Chang J.C. Kan Y.W. NRF2, a member of the NFE2 family of transcription factors, is not essential for murine erythropoiesis, growth, and development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13943-13948Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and were back-crossed 10 generations to C57BL/6J background to produce nearly isogenic lines. Studies were done using age-matched 12–16-week-old Nrf2−/− and wild type male mice. Mice were housed on 12-h light and dark cycles under controlled environmental settings (23 ± 1 °C), with free access to food and water. Age-matched wild type and Nrf2−/− mice were fed either a standard global rodent diet (Harland Teklad 2020x) or a high fat diet chow containing 60% kcal from fat (Harlan Teklad TD.06414). The fatty acid profile of the high fat diet as a percentage of total fat consists of 37% saturated, 47% monounsaturated, of 16% polyunsaturated fat. Indirect calorimetry to measure oxygen (O2) consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) production, activity, and food intake was done using the Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Mice were individually housed in metabolic chambers maintained at 20–22 °C in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. After the mice had adapted to the environment of the metabolic chamber for 72 h, metabolic parameters were assessed. Activity was monitored by the number of times a mouse moved through infrared beams crossing the cages. Body fat and lean mass were measured using an EchoMRI-100 (Echo Medical Systems, Houston, TX). Glucose tolerance tests were conducted in animals that were fasted overnight. Glucose was administered by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 1 mg/g body weight. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein at time 0 (prior to the glucose injection) and 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose loading for blood glucose. Blood glucose concentrations were measured using a TRUE-Test blood glucose meter (Nipro Diagnostics, Fort Lauderdale, FL). Fasting serum triglyceride levels were analyzed with a serum triglyceride kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma), and serum concentrations of insulin were determined using the Ultra Sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA Kit from Crystal Chem (Downers Grove, IL). RNA was extracted using TRIzol RNA reagent and further purified using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit. cDNA synthesis was generated with a Superscript III first-strand synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Amplification of cDNA occurred in a Step One Plus PCR machine (ABI) using the FastStart SYBR Green reagent in duplicate 10-μl reactions. The ribosomal phosphoprotein large P0 (RPLP0) gene was used as a reference control, and relative expression was calculated using the expression, 2(Ct test gene − CtRPLP0). -Fold change in expression was determined from the difference between the averaged expression levels relative to control.

Samples were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then blocked in 5% milk at room temperature for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, blots were washed, and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added and incubated for 1 h. Blots were visualized using a chemiluminescent detection system. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and imbedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were stained with H&E and visualized using a Nikon microscope equipped with a CCD camera. From WAT of mice fed a high fat diet, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol RNA reagent and further purified using RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit. Three independent replicates were used for both wild type and Nrf2−/− mice. Integrity and purity of the samples were assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer, and libraries for RNA-Seq were generated using the Illumina Truseq kit version 2 per the manufacturer's instructions. RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 next generation sequencer using single read 50-bp (SR50) chemistry with a read depth of >10 million reads/sample. Reads are processed and mapped to a reference genome (mm10, built name NCBIM37) using ELAND. Transcript abundance quantification was assigned using normalized read counts, such as FPKM, and statistical testing for differential expression was performed using Cufflinks. Differentially expressed genes were further analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. For intracellular reactive oxygen species measurements, cells were incubated with 10 μm CM-H2DCFDA in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry. Oxidative stress was induced in cells by incubating with 25 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase for 6 h at 37 °C prior to CM-H2DCFDA staining. Antioxidant treatment was accomplished by incubation with 100 μm BHA for 6 h at 37 °C. The Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer was utilized for measuring the oxygen consumption of adherent MEF cells as well as extracted adipose tissue explants. The protocol for acquisition of intra-abdominal WAT, preparation of tissue, and usage of XF24 was performed as described previously (43.Dunham-Snary K.J. Sandel M.W. Westbrook D.G. Ballinger S.W. A method for assessing mitochondrial bioenergetics in whole white adipose tissues.Redox Biol. 2014; 2: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), with minor changes. The sensor cartridge was calibrated with calibration buffer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA) at 37 °C the day before oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements. Intra-abdominal WAT was dissected into small pieces (∼5 mg) and washed extensively with XF-Basal Medium containing 25 mm HEPES and 25 mm glucose. Two pieces of isolated WAT weighing a total of 10 mg were placed into each well of a XF24 Islet Capture Microplate (Seahorse Bioscience), and each well was covered with a capture screen to hold the tissues in place while allowing for free perfusion. XF Basal Medium supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm l-glutamine (450 μl) was then added, and the OCR was measured in a XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's protocol. OCR readings were taken over time under basal conditions and after the addition of mitochondrial inhibitors, oligomycin (8 μg/ml), carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP; 8 μm), and a mixture of rotenone (3 μm) and antimycin-A (12 μm), in succession. A minimum of five wells were utilized per condition in any given experiment. Plates were saved, and tissue protein concentrations were measured by a Bradford assay. OCR was determined by Seahorse XF-24 software as a function of time and normalized by protein concentration (pmol/min/μg), respectively. Bioenergetic parameters assessed were basal, ATP-linked respiration, proton leak, maximal, and reserve capacity. The basal respiration rate was calculated by subtracting the residual OCR determined after the addition of rotenone and antimycin-A. ATP-linked respiration was determined from the difference between basal OCR and OCR following oligomycin addition. The difference in OCR between rotenone and oligomycin represented the amount of oxygen consumed that is due to proton leak. Maximal OCR was determined by subtracting the OCR after rotenone addition from the OCR induced by FCCP. Last, the reserve capacity was calculated by the difference between maximal and basal respiration. All data are expressed as a percentage of the basal OCR to allow comparison between the different genotypes. For MEF cells, 50,000 cells were plated in XF 24-well plates 1 day before analysis. This allowed for 70–90% confluence on the day of measurement. The sensor cartridge was hydrated 24 h before the run as indicated by the manufacturer's protocol. On the day of the run, cells were washed two times with Seahorse Basal Medium containing 25 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 4 mm l-glutamine and then covered with 450 μl of the same basal medium. The OCR was measured in a XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's protocol. OCR readings were taken over time under basal conditions and after the addition of mitochondrial inhibitors, oligomycin (1 μ"

In recent years, we have characterized the enzymatic activity of the PKMT SETD6 (9.Chang Y. Levy D. Horton J.R. Peng J. Zhang X. Gozani O. Cheng X.

It was recently shown that mono-methylation of H2AZ by SETD6 at lysine 7 is required for the maintenance of embryonic stem cell self-renewal (11.Binda O. Sevilla A. LeRoy G. Lemischka I.R.

Using a proteomic approach (13.Levy D. Liu C.L. Yang Z. Newman A.M. Alizadeh A.A. Utz P.J. Gozani O. A proteomic approach for the identification of novel lysine methyltransferase substrates.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2011; 4: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we identified a number of novel SETD6 substrates, one of which was PAK4 (p21-activated kinase 4). PAK4 is a member of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases and an effector of activated Cdc42. Cdc42 directly regulates PAK4 activity in mammalian cells through an auto-inhibitory domain (AID), which inhibits PAK4 catalytic activity (14.Selamat W. Tay P.L. Baskaran Y. Manser E.

PAK4 is involved in many cellular processes, playing a role in cytoskeletal organization, cell motility, and cell cycle regulation. Moreover, constitutive knock-out of PAK4 in mice is lethal during embryonic development (16.Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A.

Fram S. Jones G.E. Wells C.M. Signalling to cancer cell invasion through PAK family kinases.Front. Biosci. 2011; 16: 849-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that PAK4 regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by directly phosphorylating β-catenin at Ser-675, leading to its stabilization and to the enhancement of β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity by interaction with the TCF/LEF transcriptional complex leading, to activation of Wnt target genes (21.Li Y. Shao Y. Tong Y. Shen T. Zhang J. Gu H. Li F. Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of PAK4 modulates β-catenin intracellular translocation and signaling.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is critical for normal embryonic developmental patterning, cellular proliferation, and homeostasis, and its aberrant activity is linked to the progression of different human malignancies (22.Bikkavilli R.K. Feigin M.E. Malbon C.C. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase regulates canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling by inactivation of GSK3β.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3598-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this study we characterized SETD6 activity on PAK4 and linked this cross-talk to the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We show that SETD6 binds and methylates PAK4 both in vitro and in cells at chromatin. Depletion of SETD6 using the CRISPR/CAS9 system in various cell lines leads to a dramatic reduction in the expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes. The presence of SETD6 on chromatin enhances the physical interaction between PAK4 and β-catenin. Simultaneously, PAK4 serves as the mediator of SETD6-β-catenin association. Together, our data suggest that the functional interplay between SETD6, PAK4, and β-catenin is critical for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin target genes. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T), human lung carcinoma cells (A549) and human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma, D5671) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 2 mg/ml l-glutamine (Sigma, G7513), penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma, P0781), and non-essential amino acids (Sigma, M7145). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in humidified incubator with 5% CO2. For cell transfection, cells were plated in 5- or 10-cm plates, and transfected using Mirus transfection reagents (TransIT®-LT1 for HEK-293T cells, or TransIT®-X2 for A549 and MDA-MB-231 cells), according to the manufacturer's instructions. LRP6 ΔN plasmid was used to activate the Wnt signaling pathway, and was transfected for 24–48 h. For CRISPR/CAS9-mediated gene disruption, four different sgRNAs for SETD6 were cloned to the lentiCRISPR plasmid (Addgene, #49535). Following transduction and puromycin selection, single clones were isolated and expanded. The β-catenin coding sequence was excised from pFLAG-CMV-2 β-catenin (kindly provided by Inon Ben-Neriah) and cloned into pcDNA3.1 3×FLAG and pET-Duet plasmids for overexpression and protein purification, respectively. TOP-GFP and LRP6 ΔN plasmids were kindly provided by Amir Orian. For MBT pull-down assays, GST-3xMBT (from pGEX-3xMBT, provided by Or Gozani) was subcloned into pET-Duet. PAK4 and SETD6 sequences were amplified by PCR and were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 3×FLAG and pcDNA3.1 3×HA plasmids. For recombinant protein purification, PAK4 was cloned into pET-Duet and pET-Sumo plasmids. Escherichia coli BL21 transformed with a plasmid expressing a protein of interest were grown in LB medium. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation after IPTG induction and lysed by sonication on ice (18% amplitude, 1 min total, 10 s on/off). The GST fusion proteins were purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE) and eluted with 10 mg/ml reduced glutathione (Sigma). His-tagged purified proteins were purified on Ni-NTA beads (Pierce), eluted with 500 mm imidazole buffer followed by an overnight dialysis. Recombinant SETD6 was overexpressed and purified from insect cells as previously described at Levy et al. (10.Levy D. Kuo A.J. Chang Y. Schaefer U. Kitson C. Cheung P. Espejo A. Zee B.M. Liu C.L.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies used are: anti-PAK4 (Cell Signaling, C-3242S), anti-β-catenin (Abcam, ab32572), anti-pan-methyl (Abcam, ab23366), and anti-GFP (MBL, 598). Mouse monoclonal antibodies used are: anti-SETD6 (Genetex, GTX629891), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma, F1804), anti-HA (Millipore, 05–904), anti-actin (Abcam, ab3280), anti-tubulin (Abcam, ab44928), and anti-histone3 (H3) (Abcam, ab10799). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (111-035-144 and 115-035-062, respectively). Antibodies were diluted and prepared in TBST with 5% BSA or in PBST with 10% skim milk, according to manufacturer's recommendations. For Western blot analysis, cells were homogenized and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm DTT, and 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-FLAG M2 Affinity gel (Sigma, A2220) or A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-2003) conjugated to the antibody of interest. Briefly, ∼200 μg of proteins extracted from cells using RIPA buffer were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 15 μl of pre-washed FLAG M2 beads or A/G beads. The beads were then washed three times with RIPA buffer, heated for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C and resolved on 7–10% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western blot analysis. MBT pull-downs were performed as previously described (23.Carlson S.M. Moore K.E. Green E.M. Martin G.M. Gozani O. Proteome-wide enrichment of proteins modified by lysine methylation.Nat.

To increase the solubility of the chromatin, cells were treated with benzonase nuclease enzyme (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C prior to the pull-down procedure. RNA extraction was performed using the NucleoSpin RNA Kit (Macherey-Nagel). Extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time qPCR was carried out using the UPL probe library system (Roche). The real-time qPCR primers were the following; GAPDH: forward, 5′-AGCCACATCGCTCAGACAC-3′, reverse, 5′-GCCCAATACGACCAAATCC-3′; CCND1:forward, 5′-GCTGTGCATCTACACCGACA-3′, reverse, 5′-TTGAGCTTGTTCACCAGGAG-3′; MET: forward, 5′-TCGATCAGGACCATCAACC-3′, reverse, 5′-TCAATGGGATCTTCGTGATCT-3′; MYC: forward, 5′-CGGTTTTCGGGGCTTTAT-3′, reverse, 5′-GGCTCTTCCACCCTAGCC-3′; SOX9: forward, 5′-GTACCCGCACTTGCACAAC-3′, reverse, 5′-TCTCGCTCTCGTTCAGAAGTC-3′; YAP: forward, 5′-AATCCCACTCCCGACAGG-3′, reverse, 5′-GACTACTCCAGTGGGGGTCA-3′; CTBP1: forward, 5′-CGAGTCGGAACCCTTCAG-3′, reverse, 5′-CAGATGAGGTTGGGTGCAT-3′; JUN: forward, 5′-CCAAAGGATAGTGCGATGTTT-3′, reverse, 5′-CTGTCCCTCTCCACTGCAAC-3′; SENP2:forward, 5′-TCACTGGCTCAATGATGAAGTC-3′, reverse, 5′-AGTGCTGGATAGCCTTGCTT-3′. All samples were amplified in triplicates in a 384-well plate using the following cycling conditions: 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 10 s, 30 s at 60 °Cand 1 s at 72 °C. The reaction was performed using 0.2 μl of cDNA, 0.45 μl of each primer, and LightCycler® 480 Probes Master Mix for total volume reaction of 12 μl. Gene expression levels were analyzed relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH and controls of the experiment. For assays with recombinant proteins, the methylation assay reaction (total volume of 25 μl) contained 4 μg of a substrate protein and 4 μg of GST-SETD6, 2mCi of 3H-labeled S-adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet, Perkin-Elmer) and PKMT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2). The reaction tube was incubated overnight at 30 °C. For assays using proteins immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells, FLAG-PAK4 or empty plasmid transfections were immunoprecipitated using FLAG M2 beads, and then incubated overnight at 30 °C in a 25-μl reaction, containing 4 μg of recombinant GST-SETD6, 2 mCi 3H-labeled S-adenosyl-methionine and PKMT buffer. These reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE for Coomassie staining (Expedeon, InstantBlue) and exposed to autoradiogram. 2 μg of recombinant proteins (BSA, His-PAK4 or His-β-catenin) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were added to a “sticky surface” (Greiner Microlon) 96-well plate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 3% BSA in PBST. After three washes with PBST, the plate was covered with 0.5 μg of GST-SETD6 or GST protein (negative control) diluted in 1% BSA in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were then washed and incubated with primary antibody (anti-GST, 1:4000 dilution) followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, 1:2000 dilution) for 1 h. Finally, TMB reagent and then 1N H2SO4 were added, and the absorbance at 450 nm was detected using a Tecan Infinite M200 plate reader. Results are represented as relative absorbance fold compared with GST or BSA. Biochemical fractionation was performed as previously described (25.Méndez J. Stillman B. Chromatin association of human origin recognition complex, cdc6, and minichromosome maintenance proteins during the cell cycle: assembly of prereplication complexes in late mitosis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), with a final step added. Briefly, the chromatin pellet was resuspended for 30 min on ice in buffer C (RIPA buffer, 1 mm MgCl2 and benzonase nuclease enzyme (Sigma)), and supernatant was collected by low-speed centrifugation (5 min, 1,700 × g, 4 °C). Protein-protein ChIP was modified from a published protocol (26.Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Protocol for the fast chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) method.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). After cross-linking, cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture) for 10 min on ice. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture) for 10 min on ice, and then sonicated (Bioruptor, Diagenode) with high power settings for 3 cycles, 6 min each cycle (30 s on/off). Samples were centrifuged (17 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C), and the soluble chromatin fraction was collected. The soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated as described above, washed according to the published protocol, resolved by SDS-PAGE gel, and analyzed by Western blot. In a proteomic screen for novel SETD6 substrates, we previously identified 118 proteins that were methylated by SETD6 (13.Levy D. Liu C.L. Yang Z. Newman A.M. Alizadeh A.A. Utz P.J. Gozani O. A proteomic approach for the identification of novel lysine methyltransferase substrates.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2011; 4: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One of these newly identified SETD6 substrates was PAK4 (Fig. 1A). To validate this finding we performed an in vitro methylation assay in the presence of purified recombinant His-Sumo-PAK4 and GST-SETD6. As shown in Fig. 1B, recombinant PAK4 is methylated by GST-SETD6. BSA served as a negative control for the experiment. Consistent with these results, we found that immunoprecipitated FLAG-PAK4 from HEK-293T cells is methylated in vitro by recombinant SETD6 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, a direct interaction between the two proteins was demonstrated by ELISA experiment (Fig. 1D). From these data we concluded that SETD6 interacts with and methylates PAK4 in vitro. To determine whether SETD6 methylates PAK4 in cells, we have utilized the MBT pull-down assay (23.Carlson S.M. Moore K.E. Green E.M. Martin G.M. Gozani O.

MBT serves as an affinity reagent to perform direct pull-downs of methylated lysine residues in cells followed by Western blot analysis (23.Carlson S.M. Moore K.E. Green E.M. Martin G.M. Gozani O.

Overexpression of FLAG-PAK4 and HA-SETD6 in HEK-293T cells, followed by protein extraction and MBT pull-down, revealed that PAK4 is methylated in cells and that methylation is significantly increased in the presence of SETD6 (Fig. 2A). This was also the case for endogenous PAK4 (Fig. 2B, upper panel). In a co-immunoprecipitation we observed that overexpressed SETD6 interacts with endogenous PAK4 in cells (Fig. 2B). The interaction between SETD6 and PAK4 was also confirmed in a reciprocal experiment where we immunoprecipitated endogenous PAK4 (Fig. 2B). Based on this set of experiments, we have concluded that SETD6 methylates and binds PAK4 in cells. In biochemical fractionation experiments, that separate the cytosol from the nucleus we observed that endogenous SETD6 and PAK4 localized both to the cytosol and the chromatin fractions (Fig. 2C). Based on our previous findings that SETD6 plays a key role in regulating NF-κB transcriptional activity (10.Levy D. Kuo A.J. Chang Y. Schaefer U. Kitson C. Cheung P. Espejo A. Zee B.M. Liu C.L. Tangsombatvisit S. Tennen R.I. Kuo A.Y. Tanjing S. Cheung R. Chua K.F. Utz P.J. Shi X. Prinjha R.K. Lee K. Garcia B.A. Bedford M.T. Tarakhovsky A. Cheng X. Gozani O. Lysine methylation of the NF-κB subunit RelA by SETD6 couples activity of the histone methyltransferase GLP at chromatin to tonic repression of NF-kappaB signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and along with our new finding that SETD6 is localized to chromatin, we postulated that the interaction and the methylation of PAK4 by SETD6 takes place at chromatin. Indeed, chromatin isolation, followed by co-immunoprecipitation of overexpressed FLAG-PAK4 and HA-SETD6 from HEK-293T cells, revealed a strong interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, MBT pull-down assay on chromatin-isolated fraction revealed that PAK4 is methylated by SETD6 at chromatin (Fig. 2E). Collectively these data demonstrate that chromatin associated PAK4 is bound to and methylated by SETD6. PAK4 constitutively cycles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and modulates the dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking and signaling activity of β-catenin in the Wnt pathway (21.Li Y. Shao Y. Tong Y. Shen T. Zhang J. Gu H. Li F. Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of PAK4 modulates β-catenin intracellular translocation and signaling.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that SETD6 regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling. To investigate the relationship between SETD6 and the Wnt signaling pathway we took advantage of the TOP-GFP system which consists of multimerized TCF/LEF binding sites fused to GFP and allows the monitoring of β-catenin transcriptional activity (27.Vermeulen L. De Sousa E.M.F. van der Heijden M. Cameron K. de Jong J.H. Borovski T. Tuynman J.B. Todaro M. Merz C. Rodermond H. Sprick M.R. Kemper K. Richel D.J. Stassi G. Medema J.P.

Domen J. Scherer D.C. Willert K. Hintz L. Nusse R. Weissman I.L. A role for Wnt signalling in self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2003; 423: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). We used CRISPR/CAS9 in HEK-293T cells to generate two SETD6 knock-out cell lines (Fig. 3B). When we transfected wild-type cells and the two knock-out cell lines with the TOP-GFP plasmid, we observed a 50% reduction in the expression of GFP-positive cells in CRISPR-SETD6 cells compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 3A, microscopic images and quantification, respectively). Western blot analysis of the TOP-GFP expression in wild-type compared with CRISPR-SETD6 knock-out HEK-293T, MDA-MB-231, and A549 cells revealed the same trend (Fig. 3B). Next, RNA was extracted from MDA-MB-231 cells, and the expression of various β-catenin target genes was measured by qPCR. As shown in Fig. 3C, the basal expression levels of various β-catenin target genes were dramatically down-regulated in the CRISPR-SETD6 cells compared with the wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that SETD6 plays a role in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional program under basal conditions, and that SETD6 and β-catenin participate at the same pathway. These results led us to hypothesize that SETD6 methylates β-catenin, and therefore we were encouraged to look for a direct interaction between them. In an in vitro methylation assay (Fig. 4A), we observed that β-catenin is not methylated by SETD6. To test whether PAK4 mediates β-catenin methylation, we added PAK4 to the reaction (Fig. 4A, lane 3). We found that while PAK4 is specifically methylated by SETD6, β-catenin is not. To determine whether β-catenin is methylated by SETD6 in cells we immunoprecipitated chromatin associated FLAG-β-catenin with or without overexpression of HA-SETD6 followed by a Western blot with a pan-methyl antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, SETD6 did not methylate β-catenin also in the presence of PAK4. To test if there is a direct physical interaction between SETD6 and β-catenin, we performed an ELISA experiment using recombinant proteins (Fig. 4C). In this experiment, we confirmed the strong association between SETD6 and PAK4. Surprisingly, we could also observe a weak interaction between SETD6 and β-catenin. Taken together, these data indicate that SETD6 does not methylate β-catenin; however a weak interaction is observed between these two proteins. It was previously shown that PAK4 binds and phosphorylates β-catenin at Ser-675, contributing to its stability and promoting its transcriptional activity (29.MacDonald B.T. Tamai K. He X. Wnt/β-catenin signaling: components, mechanisms, and diseases.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 9-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). Having demonstrated that (i) SETD6 methylates and interacts with PAK4 at chromatin (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2.), (ii) SETD6 positively regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Fig. 3) and (iii) β-catenin is not methylated by SETD6 in vitro and in cells (Fig. 4), we hypothesized that a three-protein SETD6-PAK4-β-catenin complex is formed at chromatin and that PAK4 serves as a linker. To address this hypothesis we tested the interaction between SETD6 and β-catenin in the presence or absence of PAK4 (Fig. 5A). Consistent with our ELISA experiment (Fig. 4C) we could identify a very weak interaction between SETD6 and β-catenin in cells. However, a significantly stronger physical interaction between FLAG-β-catenin and HA-SETD6 was observed in the presence of HA-PAK4. We confirmed this result by ELISA (Fig. 5B). In this experiment, the plate was covered with 3 layers of different recombinant proteins as follows: (i) His-β-catenin; (ii) His-Sumo-PAK4 or His-Sumo; and (iii) GST-SETD6 or GST. We found that the interaction between His-β-catenin and GST-SETD6 was significantly elevated only upon His-Sumo-PAK4 addition. Furthermore, the interaction between PAK4 and β-catenin at chromatin in CRISPR-SETD6 knock-out HEK-293T cells was significantly elevated after overexpress"

By using data from 18 countries with at least two survey rounds with HIV testing, and dividing the countries into three regions (Western/Central, Eastern and Southern) we were able to examine cross-country and regional changes in the female: male HIV prevalence ratio over time. Logistic regression was used to estimate female: male HIV prevalence ratios in urban versus rural areas and for different categories of education and marital status. To assess changes over time, we compared the confidence intervals of the prevalence ratios.The female: male HIV prevalence ratio was above one in all countries in at least one survey round for both ages 15-24 years and 25-49 years. In 13 out of 18 countries the prevalence ratio was higher for the younger age group compared to the age group 25-49 years (3 significant) and this difference in prevalence ratios between the age groups did not change over time. Overall, there was a higher frequency of increasing than decreasing prevalence ratios. The gender disparity was greater among those who were married/living together than among the never-married, and over time, the ratio was more stable among the married/living together. The study found no clear differential changes by education.Women continue to carry the greater burden of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa and there is no clear pattern of change in the gap between men and women as the direction and magnitude of change in the prevalence ratios varied greatly."
https://openalex.org/W2270040952,"Articular cartilage has poor capability for repair following trauma or degenerative pathology due to avascular property, low cell density and migratory ability. Discovery of novel therapeutic approaches for articular cartilage repair remains a significant clinical need. Hypoxia is a hallmark for cartilage development and pathology. Hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1α) has been identified as a key mediator for chondrocytes to response to fluctuations of oxygen availability during cartilage development or repair. This suggests that HIF-1α may serve as a target for modulating chondrocyte functions. In this study, using phenotypic cellular screen assays, we identify that Icariin, an active flavonoid component from Herba Epimedii, activates HIF-1α expression in chondrocytes. We performed systemic in vitro and in vivo analysis to determine the roles of Icariin in regulation of chondrogenesis. Our results show that Icariin significantly increases hypoxia responsive element luciferase reporter activity, which is accompanied by increased accumulation and nuclear translocation of HIF-1α in murine chondrocytes. The phenotype is associated with inhibiting PHD activity through interaction between Icariin and iron ions. The upregulation of HIF-1α mRNA levels in chondrocytes persists during chondrogenic differentiation for 7 and 14 days. Icariin (10-6 M) increases the proliferation of chondrocytes or chondroprogenitors examined by MTT, BrdU incorporation or colony formation assays. Icariin enhances chondrogenic marker expression in a micromass culture including Sox9, collagen type 2 (Col2α1) and aggrecan as determined by real-time PCR and promotes extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis indicated by Alcian blue staining. ELISA assays show dramatically increased production of aggrecan and hydroxyproline in Icariin-treated cultures at day 14 of chondrogenic differentiation as compared with the controls. Meanwhile, the expression of chondrocyte catabolic marker genes including Mmp2, Mmp9, Mmp13, Adamts4 and Adamts5 was downregulated following Icariin treatment for 14 days. In a differentiation assay using bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) carrying HIF-1α floxed allele, the promotive effect of Icariin on chondrogenic differentiation is largely decreased following Cre recombinase-mediated deletion of HIF-1α in MSCs as indicated by Alcian blue staining for proteoglycan synthesis. In an alginate hydrogel 3D culture system, Icariin increases Safranin O positive (SO+) cartilage area. This phenotype is accompanied by upregulation of HIF-1α, increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive (PCNA+) cell numbers, SOX9+ chondrogenic cell numbers, and Col2 expression in the newly formed cartilage. Coincide with the micromass culture, Icariin treatment upregulates mRNA levels of Sox9, Col2α1, aggrecan and Col10α1 in the 3D cultures. We then generated alginate hydrogel 3D complexes incorporated with Icariin. The 3D complexes were transplanted in a mouse osteochondral defect model. ICRS II histological scoring at 6 and 12 weeks post-transplantation shows that 3D complexes incorporated with Icariin significantly enhance articular cartilage repair with higher scores particularly in selected parameters including SO+ cartilage area, subchondral bone and overall assessment than that of the controls. The results suggest that Icariin may inhibit PHD activity likely through competition for cellular iron ions and therefore it may serve as an HIF-1α activator to promote articular cartilage repair through regulating chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation and integration with subchondral bone formation."

https://openalex.org/W2284248080,"Purpose Irreversible electroporation (IRE) uses short duration, high-voltage electrical pulses to induce cell death via nanoscale defects resulting from altered transmembrane potential. The technique is gaining interest for ablations in unresectable pancreatic and hepatobiliary cancer. Metal stents are often used for palliative biliary drainage in these patients, but are currently seen as an absolute contraindication for IRE due to the perceived risk of direct heating of the metal and its surroundings. This study investigates the thermal and tissue viability changes due to a metal stent during IRE. Methods IRE was performed in a homogeneous tissue model (polyacrylamide gel), without and with a metal stent placed perpendicular and parallel to the electrodes, delivering 90 and 270 pulses (15–35 A, 90 μsec, 1.5 cm active tip exposure, 1.5 cm interelectrode distance, 1000–1500 V/cm, 90 pulses/min), and in-vivo in a porcine liver (4 ablations). Temperature changes were measured with an infrared thermal camera and with fiber-optic probes. Tissue viability after in-vivo IRE was investigated macroscopically using 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) vitality staining. Results In the gel, direct stent-heating was not observed. Contrarily, the presence of a stent between the electrodes caused a higher increase in median temperature near the electrodes (23.2 vs 13.3°C [90 pulses]; p = 0.021, and 33.1 vs 24.8°C [270 pulses]; p = 0.242). In-vivo, no temperature difference was observed for ablations with and without a stent. Tissue examination showed white coagulation 1mm around the electrodes only. A rim of vital tissue remained around the stent, whereas ablation without stent resulted in complete tissue avitality. Conclusion IRE in the vicinity of a metal stent does not cause notable direct heating of the metal, but results in higher temperatures around the electrodes and remnant viable tissue. Future studies should determine for which clinical indications IRE in the presence of metal stents is safe and effective."
https://openalex.org/W2331142939,"Neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 4 (Nedd4) was the first ubiquitin protein ligase identified to interact with connexin43 (Cx43), and its suppressed expression results in accumulation of gap junction plaques at the plasma membrane. Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of Cx43 is required to recruit Eps15 and target Cx43 to the endocytic pathway. Although the Cx43 residues that undergo ubiquitination are still unknown, in this study we address other unresolved questions pertaining to the molecular mechanisms mediating the direct interaction between Nedd4 (WW1–3 domains) and Cx43 (carboxyl terminus (CT)). All three WW domains display a similar three antiparallel β-strand structure and interact with the same Cx43CT 283PPXY286 sequence. Although Tyr286 is essential for the interaction, MAPK phosphorylation of the preceding serine residues (Ser(P)279 and Ser(P)282) increases the binding affinity by 2-fold for the WW domains (WW2 > WW3 ≫ WW1). The structure of the WW2·Cx43CT276–289(Ser(P)279, Ser(P)282) complex reveals that coordination of Ser(P)282 with the end of β-strand 3 enables Ser(P)279 to interact with the back face of β-strand 3 (Tyr286 is on the front face) and loop 2, forming a horseshoe-shaped arrangement. The close sequence identity of WW2 with WW1 and WW3 residues that interact with the Cx43CT PPXY motif and Ser(P)279/Ser(P)282 strongly suggests that the significantly lower binding affinity of WW1 is the result of a more rigid structure. This study presents the first structure illustrating how phosphorylation of the Cx43CT domain helps mediate the interaction with a molecular partner involved in gap junction regulation.

All three WW domains display a similar three antiparallel β-strand structure and interact with the same Cx43CT 283PPXY286 sequence. Although Tyr286 is essential for the interaction, MAPK phosphorylation of the preceding serine residues (Ser(P)279 and Ser(P)282) increases the binding affinity by 2-fold for the WW domains (WW2 > WW3 ≫ WW1). The structure of the WW2·Cx43CT276–289(Ser(P)279, Ser(P)282) complex reveals that coordination of Ser(P)282 with the end of β-strand 3 enables Ser(P)279 to interact with the back face of β-strand 3 (Tyr286 is on the front face) and loop 2, forming a horseshoe-shaped arrangement. The close sequence identity of WW2 with WW1 and WW3 residues that interact with the Cx43CT PPXY motif and Ser(P)279/Ser(P)282 strongly suggests that the significantly lower binding affinity of WW1 is the result of a more rigid structure. This study presents the first structure illustrating how phosphorylation of the Cx43CT domain helps mediate the interaction with a molecular partner involved in gap junction regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2262356327,"Severe dengue is caused by host responses to viral infection, but the pathogenesis remains unknown. This is, in part, due to the lack of suitable animal models. Here, we report a non-mouse-adapted low-passage DENV-3 clinical isolate, DV3P12/08, derived from recently infected patients. DV3P12/08 caused a lethal systemic infection in type I and II IFN receptor KO mice (IFN-α/β/γR KO mice), which have the C57/BL6 background. Infection with DV3P12/08 induced a cytokine storm, resulting in severe vascular leakage (mainly in the liver, kidney and intestine) and organ damage, leading to extensive hemorrhage and rapid death. DV3P12/08 infection triggered the release of large amounts of TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1. Treatment with a neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody (Ab) extended survival and reduced liver damage without affecting virus production. Anti-IL-6 neutralizing Ab partly prolonged mouse survival. The anti-TNF-α Ab suppressed IL-6, MCP-1, and IFN-γ levels, suggesting that the severe response to infection was triggered by TNF-α. High levels of TNF-α mRNA were expressed in the liver and kidneys, but not in the small intestine, of infected mice. Conversely, high levels of IL-6 mRNA were expressed in the intestine. Importantly, treatment with Angiopoietin-1, which is known to stabilize blood vessels, prolonged the survival of DV3P12/08-infected mice. Taken together, the results suggest that an increased level of TNF-α together with concomitant upregulation of Tie2/Angiopoietin signaling have critical roles in severe dengue infection."
https://openalex.org/W2259179159,"Chouioia cunea Yang is an endoparasitic wasp that attacks pupae of Hyphantria cunea (Drury), an invasive moth species that severely damages forests in China. Chemosensory systems of insects are used to detect volatile chemical odors such as female sex pheromones and host plant volatiles. The antennae of parasite wasps are important for host detection and other sensory-mediated behaviors. We identified and documented differential expression profiles of chemoreception genes in C. cunea antennae. A total of 25 OBPs, 80 ORs, 10 IRs, 11 CSP, 1 SNMPs, and 17 GRs were annotated from adult male and female C. cunea antennal transcriptomes. The expression profiles of 25 OBPs, 16 ORs, and 17 GRs, 5 CSP, 5 IRs and 1 SNMP were determined by RT-PCR and RT-qPCR for the antenna, head, thorax, and abdomen of male and female C. cunea. A total of 8 OBPs, 14 ORs, and 8 GRs, 1 CSP, 4 IRs and 1 SNMPs were exclusively or primarily expressed in female antennae. These female antennal-specific or dominant expression profiles may assist in locating suitable host and oviposition sites. These genes will provide useful targets for advanced study of their biological functions."

https://openalex.org/W2255036800,"The endodermal region of the digestive system in the freshwater shrimp Neocaridina heteropoda (Crustacea, Malacostraca) consists of a tube-shaped intestine and large hepatopancreas, which is formed by numerous blind-ended tubules. The precise structure and ultrastructure of these regions were presented in our previous studies, while here we focused on the cell death processes and their effect on the functioning of the midgut. We used transmission electron microscopy, light and confocal microscopes to describe and detect cell death, while a quantitative assessment of cells with depolarized mitochondria helped us to establish whether there is the relationship between cell death and the inactivation of mitochondria. Three types of the cell death were observed in the intestine and hepatopancreas-apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy. No differences were observed in the course of these processes in males and females and or in the intestine and hepatopancreas of the shrimp that were examined. Our studies revealed that apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy only involves the fully developed cells of the midgut epithelium that have contact with the midgut lumen-D-cells in the intestine and B- and F-cells in hepatopancreas, while E-cells (midgut stem cells) did not die. A distinct correlation between the accumulation of E-cells and the activation of apoptosis was detected in the anterior region of the intestine, while necrosis was an accidental process. Degenerating organelles, mainly mitochondria were neutralized and eventually, the activation of cell death was prevented in the entire epithelium due to autophagy. Therefore, we state that autophagy plays a role of the survival factor."

Information on infant feeding was collected monthly during the first 6 months of life, every two months until the child was 1 year old over and when children were between 4 and 7 years old. The associations between duration of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding and consumption of fruits and vegetables were tested by a logistic regression model.Approximately 60% and 45% of children consumed fruits and vegetables, respectively, five or more times a week. Consumption of vegetables among 4-7-year-old children was higher in children who were breastfed for 12 months or longer (OR 2.7; 95%CI 1.49-4.93); however, exclusive breastfeeding duration did not have a significant association with consumption of vegetables (OR 1.5; 95%CI 0.70-3.04). There was no association between weekly consumption of fruits and duration of breastfeeding (OR 1.3; 95%CI 0.71-2.30) or exclusive breastfeeding (OR 0.7; 95%CI 0.34-1.44).Longer duration of breastfeeding was positively associated with consumption of vegetables in children aged 4-7 years; however, there was no association with consumption of fruits. Exclusive breastfeeding duration did not have influence on consumption of fruits or vegetables."
https://openalex.org/W2262480088,"Leukotrienes (LTs) are proinflammatory lipid mediators formed from arachidonic acid in a 2-step reaction catalyzed by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) requiring the formation of 5-HPETE [5(S)-hydroperoxy-6-trans-8,11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid] and its subsequent transformation to LTA4 5-LOX is thought to receive arachidonic acid from the nuclear membrane-embedded 5-LOX-activating protein (FLAP). The crystal structure of 5-LOX revealed an active site concealed by F177 and Y181 (FY cork). We examined the influence of the FY cork on 5-LOX activity and membrane binding in HEK293 cells in the absence and presence of FLAP. Uncapping the 5-LOX active site by mutation of F177 and/or Y181 to alanine (5-LOX-F177A, 5-LOX-Y181A, 5-LOX-F177/Y181A) resulted in delayed and diminished 5-LOX membrane association in A23187-stimulated cells. For 5-LOX-F177A and 5-LOX-F177/Y181A, formation of 5-LOX products was dramatically reduced relative to 5-LOX-wild type (wt). Strikingly, coexpression of FLAP in A23187-activated HEK293 cells effectively restored formation of 5-H(p)ETE (5-hydroxy- and 5-peroxy-6-trans-8,11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid) by these same 5-LOX mutants (≈60-70% 5-LOX-wt levels) but not of LTA4 hydrolysis products. Yet 5-LOX-Y181A generated 5-H(p)ETE at levels comparable to 5-LOX-wt but reduced LTA4 hydrolysis products. Coexpression of FLAP partially restored LTA4 hydrolysis product formation by 5-LOX-Y181A. Together, the data suggest that the concealed FY cork impacts membrane association and that FLAP may help shield an uncapped active site.-Gerstmeier, J., Newcomer, M. E., Dennhardt, S., Romp, E., Fischer, J., Werz, O., Garscha, U. 5-Lipoxygenase-activating protein rescues activity of 5-lipoxygenase mutations that delay nuclear membrane association and disrupt product formation."

We identify a novel substoichiometric interactor of the complex, transcription factor ZNF131, which recruits EMSY to a large number of active, H3K4me3 marked promoters. Interestingly, using an EMSY knock-out line and subsequent rescue experiments, we show that EMSY is in most cases positively correlated with transcriptional activity of its target genes and stimulates cell proliferation.

In the eukaryotic nucleus, DNA is condensed in the form of chromatin. Chromatin is repressive to processes that require access to the DNA. Chromatin accessibility can be regulated in multiple ways, viz. by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and post-translational modifications of core histones. Furthermore, the DNA itself can also be modified. A large number of post-translational modifications on core histones have been identified and characterized, including lysine acetylation and lysine methylation. Some of these modifications are associated with active transcription, whereas others are repressive to transcription. The most studied post-translational modifications on core histones are trimethylations of lysine residues, of which several are known to occur on the N terminus of one of the four core histones, H3. Two of these (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) are linked to active promoters and gene bodies, respectively, and a third one (H3K27me3) is associated with gene silencing (1.Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8036) Google Scholar). The biology of each of these modifications is believed to be at least partially determined by proteins, so-called chromatin readers, that can specifically recognize these chromatin marks. Lysine trimethylation reader domains include the PHD finger, the chromodomain, and the Tudor domain (2.Ruthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Multivalent engagement of chromatin modifications by linked binding modules.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Previously, we used quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify a large number of chromatin readers for lysine trimethylation sites on histone H3 and H4 (3.Vermeulen M. Eberl H.C. Matarese F. Marks H. Denissov S. Butter F. Lee K.K. Olsen J.V. Hyman A.A. Stunnenberg H.G. Mann M. Quantitative interaction proteomics and genome-wide profiling of epigenetic histone marks and their readers.Cell. 2010; 142: 967-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In that study, we identified a number of previously unrelated proteins, including GATAD1, EMSY, KDM5A, and SIN3B, as readers for H3K4me3. Subsequent experiments revealed that these proteins may in fact be part of a novel protein complex. Similar observations in Drosophila were also reported by others (4.Moshkin Y.M. Kan T.W. Goodfellow H. Bezstarosti K. Maeda R.K. Pilyugin M. Karch F. Bray S.J. Demmers J.A. Verrijzer C.P.

Cell. 2009; 35: 782-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). EMSY was originally reported as a transcriptional repressor and breast cancer-associated protein that interacts with the BRCA2 protein (5.Hughes-Davies L. Huntsman D. Ruas M. Fuks F. Bye J. Chin S.F. Milner J. Brown L.A. Hsu F. Gilks B. Nielsen T. Schulzer M. Chia S. Ragaz J. Cahn A. Linger L. Ozdag H. Cattaneo E. Jordanova E.S. Schuuring E. Yu D.S. Venkitaraman A. Ponder B. Doherty A.

EMSY links the BRCA2 pathway to sporadic breast and ovarian cancer.Cell. 2003; 115: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). KDM5A is a histone lysine demethylase for H3K4me3 (6.Kooistra S.M. Helin K. Molecular mechanisms and potential functions of histone demethylases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 297-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing a PHD finger that directly binds H3K4me3 (7.Wang G.G. Song J. Wang Z. Dormann H.L. Casadio F. Li H. Luo J.L. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Haematopoietic malignancies caused by dysregulation of a chromatin-binding PHD finger.Nature. 2009; 459: 847-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). SIN3B is part of a complex containing histone deacetylase activity (8.McDonel P. Costello I. Hendrich B. Keeping things quiet: roles of NuRD and Sin3 co-repressor complexes during mammalian development.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These proteins and their associated enzymatic activities therefore suggest that the EMSY complex is a transcriptional repressor. Here, we applied state-of-the-art quantitative mass spectrometry and ChIP sequencing approaches to characterize the EMSY protein complex and its genome-wide binding profile. Our experiments revealed a striking association between EMSY and H3K4me3-marked, active promoters. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based knock-out line and rescue experiments we show that in most cases, EMSY expression is positively correlated with expression of its target genes and stimulates cell proliferation. Furthermore, we identify a novel interactor of the EMSY complex, ZNF131, which recruits EMSY to a subset of its genome-wide targets. Finally, we used immunohistochemistry on primary breast cancer tissues, which revealed a striking expression correlation between EMSY complex subunits, suggesting a functional and pathological link between these proteins in relation to breast cancer. To generate mammalian cells expressing proteins of the EMSY/KDM5A complex at near endogenous levels bacterial artificial chromosomes containing EMSY, GATAD1, PHF12, or KDM5A, respectively were obtained from the BACPAC Resources Center and a GFP cassette was inserted as a C-terminal in-frame fusion using BAC recombineering (9.Poser I.

BAC TransgeneOmics: a high-throughput method for exploration of protein function in mammals.Nature Methods. 2008; 5: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). HeLa or MCF7 cells were transfected with the recombineered BAC using Lipofectamine 2000 or PEImax (for EMSY) and selected with 400 μg/ml geneticin (G418). Expression of the recombineered ZNF131 BAC in HeLa cells proved unsuccessful hence a full-length mouse ZNF131 construct that was a gift from Juliet Daniel was cloned into the plasmid pBabePuro-C-GFP by gateway cloning that was used to generate retrovirus particles using the Phoenix ecotropic packaging cells. Finally MCF7 cells were transduced with this virus and 24 h after infection, subjected to 1 μg/ml puromycin selection. Monoclonals were isolated, and cell lines were propagated. Short hairpin knockdown of ZNF131 in the EMSY GFP expressing HeLa cells was mediated by lentiviral transduction. A set of 5 short hairpins purchased from Sigma were transfected into COS7 cells in combination with lentiviral packaging vectors using PEImax. After 24 h, virus generated into the medium was aspirated, filtered, and concentrated. The target cells (EMSY GFP HeLa) were transduced with the virus in the presence of polybrene. shRNA integrated cells were subjected to puromycin selection, 24 h after transduction. Single cells were grown into monoclonals and the knockdown status was assessed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting (Anti-ZNF131, mouse polyclonal #H0000 7690-B0IP, Abnova). The monoclonals selected for this study were shZNF131#1 (TRCN0000254328) and shZNF131#2 (TRCN0000254331). The knock-out of EMSY was created using CRISPR-Cas9 system. Ensembl transcript sequence of isoform C11orf30-001 (ENST00000529032) was used as canonical isoform. The guides were designed against an exon common to all isoforms, i.e. exon3. The oligos (Biolegio) encoding guide RNAs for inducing a double strand break (DSB) 6The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; LFQ, label-free quantitation; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. in the genome were designed using the Zhang laboratory genome engineering website CRISPR tool. Guide sequence EMSY-DSB-G2-F: AACGCCACCGTGCTGAAGTT and EMSY-DSB-G2-R: AACTTCAGCACGGTGGCGTT were used for cloning. The guides were cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) vector (10.Ran F.A. Hsu P.D. Wright J. Agarwala V. Scott D.A. Zhang F. Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8: 2281-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (6410) Google Scholar). The resulting constructs were sequence verified and used for transfection. The constructs were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine LTX&PLUS (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were grown for 2 days and subsequently selected with puromycin for a brief period of 2 days. The surviving cells were clonal diluted into 96 well plates to generate clonal populations from single cells. Genomic DNA from the clonal populations was harvested by using a genomic DNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). The DSB target region was amplified using primers EMSY-forward: GCCTGCTTGGCAGAGTTCTAT and EMSY-reverse: GACTCAGGAATCTGCTACACAA. The amplified regions were Sanger sequenced, and resulting sequences were matched to the wild type transcript. Clones with deletions were tested for knockouts using Western blots (Anti-EMSY, rabbit polyclonal, #A300-253A, Bethyl Laboratories). Re-expression of EMSY-GFP in the EMSY CRISPR knock-out lines was performed using an EMSY-GFP (EX-E2426-M29) from Genecoepia (EX-NEG-M29 was the empty control vector). Nuclear extract isolation and GFP pull-downs followed by sample preparation for mass spectrometry and data analysis was performed as described in Ref. 11.Smits A.H. Jansen P.W. Poser I. Hyman A.A. Vermeulen M. Stoichiometry of chromatin-associated protein complexes revealed by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: e28Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar. Briefly, nuclear extracts obtained from GFP-tagged protein-expressing and wild-type cells were subjected to GFP-affinity pull-downs. 1 mg of nuclear extract was used for each pull-down and incubated with GFP chromotek beads for 90 min, and then the beads were washed and subjected to on-bead trypsin digestion. The tryptic peptides were eluted and applied to online nano LC-MS/MS. Raw data were analyzed by Max Quant and t test-based statistics was applied on LFQ for interactor identification. iBAQ algorithm was used for determining the stoichiometry of the identified complexes. Four different cell lines were used for the cell proliferation assays shown in Fig. 4. WT Hela cells with empty vector control and EMSY knock-out cells (CRISPR-mediated knock-out, see Fig. 4A) were used in Fig. 4, B and C. Furthermore, EMSY knock-out cells were stably transfected (PEI transfection reagent, G418 selection) with an EMSY-GFP construct or an empty vector control (Fig. 4, D and E). The four resulting cell lines were trypsinized into single cells, counted, and 250 or 500 cells were seeded in duplicates in 24-well plates containing DMEM with 10% FBS. The cells were allowed to grow into visible colonies, and 10 days after seeding the colonies were fixed in methanol and stained with crystal violet. The wells were scanned to obtain representative images, and the number of colonies in each well was counted. This was expressed as % colonies survival over the initial number of cells seeded. DNA pull-downs were performed mainly as described in Ref. 12.Spruijt C.G. Gnerlich F. Smits A.H. Pfaffeneder T. Jansen P.W. Bauer C. Münzel M. Wagner M. Müller M. Khan F. Eberl H.C. Mensinga A.

For each DNA pull-down, 2.5 μg of biotinylated oligos containing 3 repeats of the DNA sequence with interspersed spacer (CONS1: GTCGCG, CONS2: GTCGCA, MUT: GCAGCG, SCR:GGGCCT) was immobilized on 25 μl of Dynabeads MyOne C1 (Invitrogen) by incubating for 1 h at room temperature in a total volume of 350 μl of DNA binding buffer (1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Beads containing immobilized DNA were then incubated with GST-lysates expressing the recombinant ZNF131 domains in a total volume of 600 μl of protein binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche, EDTA-free)) in the presence of 10 μg of poly-dAdT for 2 h at 4 °C. Baits were then washed three times with 0.5 ml of protein binding buffer after which protein bound to the beads was eluted and analyzed by Western blotting. For GST pull-downs, recombinant GST-ZNF131 fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and lysates were made. Soluble GST-tagged ZNF131 fusion proteins were then immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and subsequently used for binding proteins from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged EMSY. The bound proteins were eluted off the GA beads and analyzed by Western blotting by probing with a GFP antibody. HeLa Kyoto wild type (WT), HeLa EMSY GFP, and HeLa EMSY GFP with knockdown of ZNF131 were seeded in 15-cm dishes and 24 h later were formaldehyde cross-linked for 10 min. Chromatin obtained from the cells after sonication was subjected to overnight IP using GFP antibody (Abcam, ab290) followed by extensive washes and decross-linking. DNA was purified using the Qiagen PCR clean-up kit and the bound DNA was analyzed by qPCR using the desired primers. ChIP-Seq was carried out by conventional ChIP followed by end repair of 15 ng (for protein-GFP fusions) or 30 ng (for the histone modifications) enriched DNA as measured by Qubit fluorometer using the Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay Kit from (Invitrogen, Q32851). Adaptors were ligated to DNA fragments, which were subsequently size selected (∼300 base pair (bp). The adaptor-modified DNA fragments were subjected to limited PCR amplification (14 cycles) and quality control was made by qPCR (primers sequences are available upon request), as well as by running the PCR products on a Bioanalyzer (Bio-Rad). Finally, cluster generation and sequencing-by-synthesis (36 bp) was performed using the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (GAIIx) according to standard protocols of the manufacturer (Illumina). The image files generated by the Genome Analyzer were processed to extract DNA sequence data. Sequences were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19, Feb 2009) with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner1 (bwa,v0.5.9-r16) allowing one mismatch. Uniquely aligned reads were converted to BED format. The total number of sequenced fragments and mapped fragments are shown in supplemental Table S5. All ChIP and input samples were normalized randomly to the same number of reads (10543138). Furthermore, reads were directionally extended to 300 bp, and for each base pair in the genome the number of overlapping sequence reads was determined and averaged over a 10-bp window to create a Wiggle (WIG) file to visualize the data in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. Identification of the binding sites (peak calling) was performed using MACS (13.Zhang Y. Liu T. Meyer C.A. Eeckhoute J. Johnson D.S. Bernstein B.E. Nusbaum C. Myers R.M. Brown M. Li W. Liu X.S.

Genomic regions overlapping to the peaks in the negative control (GFP ChIP-Seq on wild type HeLa cells) were filtered out. Genomic annotation was carried out with Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment (HOMER, software v4.2). The tool annotatePeaks was used with parameters by default and defined in the help. A gtf file from GENCODE project based on release 15 (GRCh37/hg19) was used for annotations; the latter included whether a segment is in the TSS/promoter, TTS, exon, 5′ UTR exon, 3′ UTR exon, intron, or is intergenic. Since some annotations overlap, the following priority was assigned: TSS/promoter (from −1 kb to +100 bp), TTS (from −100 bp to +1 kb), CDS exon, 5′ UTR exon, 3′ UTR exon, intron, intergenic. The heatmaps and distribution plot representations were carried out with R package v2.14.1, SeqMiner v1.3.3e (14.Ye T. Krebs A.R. Choukrallah M.A. Keime C. Plewniak F. Davidson I.

Pathways with a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value lower than 0.1 were considered significant. The ZNF131 DNA-binding motifs were obtained from Donaldson et al. (21.Donaldson N.S. Nordgaard C.L.

To determine that the frequency observed is not random chance, we generated 100 simulations of random genomic sequences adjusted by the number and length of it for EMSY-binding sites defined with MACS (see above). For this purpose, we used the subcommands shuffle and getfasta included in bedtools v2.18.2. Further, we tested the differences with the Fisher's exact test (p value = 0.004) and generated the distribution plots in R package v2.14.1. 500 ng of RNA extracted from mammalian cells using the QIAgen RNA extraction kit was used for cDNA synthesis using random primers and Superscript II from the Invitrogen first-strand cDNA synthesis kit. mRNA expression of EMSY and the EMSY target genes was analyzed by qPCR using the primers designed for EMSY and EMSY target genes and the values obtained were normalized over actin expression. Gene expression data of 6791 tumor samples analyzed according to the RnaSeqV2′ pipeline was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal at 14-05-2014 to investigate the co-regulation of EMSY subunits across different cancers. Tissue samples of invasive breast cancer patients were collected between November 2004 and September 2009 at the Department of Pathology of the University Medical Centre in Utrecht (UMCU), The Netherlands. This study selected 103 tissue samples from this consecutive series. According to the Dutch Federation of Medical Scientific Societies (the FEDERA), use of redundant tissue for research purposes does not require informed consent, if the patients are offered the possibilities to refuse this (“opting out” system) and material has been used anonymously or coded. In the UMC Utrecht, all patients are informed that research may happen with their redundant tissue, and are offered to opt out. No material of patients that have opted out was used in the present study, and all materials were used anonymously. The research protocol for this study was approved by the Scientific Advisory Counsel of the UMC Utrecht Biobank. Grading was performed according to the Nottingham modification of Bloom-Richardson system, and mitoses were counted according to a strict protocol as before to arrive at the mitotic activity index (MAI) (23.van Diest P.J. Fleege J.C. Baak J.P. Syntactic structure analysis in invasive breast cancer: analysis of reproducibility, biologic background, and prognostic value.Hum.

After deparaffinization and rehydration, antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer for EMSY, SIN3B, and ZNF131, and EDTA buffer for GATAD1, KDM5A, at boiling temperature for 20 min. A cooling period of 30 min preceded the incubation of the slides with protein block for EMSY, GATAD1, and KDM5A (Novolink Max Polymer detection system, ready to use, Novocastra Laboratories Ltd, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK) for 5 min at room temperature. Incubation of the slides with the EMSY antibody (rabbit polyclonal, #A300-253A, Bethyl Laboratories) was done at a dilution of 1:100, for KDM5A (rabbit monoclonal, # 3876S, Cell Signaling) at a dilution of 1:50 and for GATAD1 (mouse monoclonal, # sc-81092, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:50, for 60 min at room temperature. For detection, a polymer (Novolink Max Polymer detection system, ready to use) was used. For ZNF131 (mouse polyclonal, # H0000 7690-B0IP, Abnova) and SIN3B (in-house), the slides were incubated with primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:50 for both of them for 60 min at room temperature. For detection a poly HRP anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG (Brightvision, ready to use, ImmunoLogic, Duiven, Netherlands) was used. All slides were developed with diaminobenzidine (5 min for Novolink protocol and 10 min for Brightvision) followed by hematoxylin counterstaining. Before the slides were mounted all sections were dehydrated in alcohol and xylene. Positive controls were used throughout; negative controls were obtained by omission of the primary antibodies from the staining procedure. Scoring of immunohistochemistry was performed by one observer (PJvD). For EMSY, KDM5A, SIN3B, ZNF131, GATAD1, the percentage of positively stained nuclei was estimated, furthermore cytoplasmic expression of EMSY was also scored in a scale of 0, 1, 2, and 3. In the statistical analysis we used the product of the EMSY nuclear and cytoplasmic scoring data. Associations among staining were tested by Chi-square analysis. Recently, we described protein-protein interactions between the H3K4me3 demethylase KDM5A, the protein EMSY, GATAD1, and components of the SIN3/HDAC complex in HeLa cells (3.Vermeulen M. Eberl H.C. Matarese F. Marks H. Denissov S. Butter F. Lee K.K. Olsen J.V. Hyman A.A. Stunnenberg H.G. Mann M. Quantitative interaction proteomics and genome-wide profiling of epigenetic histone marks and their readers.Cell. 2010; 142: 967-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). To further characterize these interactions, we generated BAC-GFP transgenic HeLa cell lines for EMSY, KDM5A, PHF12, and GATAD1. Nuclear extracts derived from these cells were subjected to single affinity GFP purifications coupled to label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (Fig. 1A). Similar, largely overlapping interactions were observed in each case, indicating that these proteins form a large multi-subunit protein complex (Fig. 1B, supplemental Table S1, for KDM5A data not shown). This protein complex resembles the recently characterized Drosophila Lid/Sin3 complex (4.Moshkin Y.M. Kan T.W. Goodfellow H. Bezstarosti K. Maeda R.K. Pilyugin M. Karch F. Bray S.J. Demmers J.A.

However, neither BRCA2 or HP1 that were initially reported as EMSY interactors (5.Hughes-Davies L. Huntsman D. Ruas M. Fuks F. Bye J. Chin S.F. Milner J. Brown L.A. Hsu F. Gilks B. Nielsen T.

Given the reported link between EMSY and breast cancer, we also purified EMSY-GFP from a breast cancer cell line, MCF7 (data not shown) and observed interactions almost identical to those observed in HeLa cells. Given the very low expression of the EMSY-GFP BAC in MCF7 cells, we used HeLa cells for most of our subsequent analyses. Interestingly, a DNA-binding zinc finger protein, ZNF131, was consistently identified in the affinity purifications, indicating that this protein may be a novel EMSY/KDM5A interactor. To validate this interaction between ZNF131 and EMSY/KDM5A we generated a stable MCF7 cell line expressing ZNF131-GFP at sub-endogenous levels. As shown in Fig. 1B, EMSY/KDM5A components co-purified with GFP-ZNF131, as well as some subunits of the MLL H3K4me3 methyltransferase complex (MLL, DPY-30). We did not, however detect the previously reported ZNF131 interactor Kaiso (21.Donaldson N.S. Nordgaard C.L. Pierre C.C. Kelly K.F. Robinson S.C. Swystun L. Henriquez R. Graham M. Daniel J.M. Kaiso regulates Znf131-mediated transcriptional activation.Exp. Cell Res. 2010; 316: 1692-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a number of other putative DNA-binding proteins were identified as interactors, including ZMYM1, ZBTB3, and ZNF281. Some of these observed interactions were also validated using Western blotting (Fig. 1C). ZNF131 contains a number of domains, including an N-terminal POZ domain and five C-terminal zinc fingers (21.Donaldson N.S. Nordgaard C.L. Pierre C.C. Kelly K.F. Robinson S.C. Swystun L. Henriquez R.

The cAMP-activated Cl(-) channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a major prosecretory channel at the ocular surface. We investigated whether compounds that target CFTR can correct the abnormal tear film in dry eye. Small-molecule activators of human wild-type CFTR identified by high-throughput screening were evaluated in cell culture and in vivo assays, to select compounds that stimulate Cl(-)-driven fluid secretion across the ocular surface in mice. An aminophenyl-1,3,5-triazine, CFTRact-K089, fully activated CFTR in cell cultures with EC50 ∼250 nM and produced an ∼8.5 mV hyperpolarization in ocular surface potential difference. When delivered topically, CFTRact-K089 doubled basal tear volume for 4 h and had no effect in CF mice. CFTRact-K089 showed sustained tear film bioavailability without detectable systemic absorption. In a mouse model of aqueous-deficient dry eye produced by lacrimal ablation, topical administration of 0.1 nmol CFTRact-K089 3 times daily restored tear volume to basal levels, preventing corneal epithelial disruption when initiated at the time of surgery and reversing it when started after development of dry eye. Our results support the potential utility of CFTR-targeted activators as a novel prosecretory treatment for dry eye.-Flores, A. M., Casey, S. D., Felix, C. M., Phuan, P. W., Verkman, A. S., Levin, M.

Juss., commonly known as neem plant in India. Since only a few reports are available regarding epigenetic modulations of microbial entities, S. coelicolor was treated with different concentrations of 5-azacytidine for this purpose and evaluated for its antibacterial potential against five human pathogenic bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila IMS/GN11, Enterococcus faecalis IMS/GN7, Salmonella typhi MTCC 3216, Shigella flexneri ATCC 12022 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923). The crude extract obtained from cultures treated with 25 μM concentration of 5-azacytidine, was found effective against all five pathogenic bacteria tested while the untreated control was only active against 3 pathogenic bacteria. HPLC analysis of crude compounds from treated cultures showed a greater number of compounds than that of the control. Extraction of whole cell protein and its SDS PAGE analysis showed an additional major protein band in 25 μM 5-azacytidine treated culture and MALDI TOF MS/MS analysis revealed that this protein belongs to the porin family."
https://openalex.org/W2269775529,"Gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas are major global cancer burdens. These cancer forms are characterized by a poor prognosis and a modest response to chemo- radio- and targeted treatment. Hence there is an obvious need for further enhanced diagnostic and treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to examine the expression and prognostic impact of human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (HER1/EGFR) and 3 (HER3), as well as the occurrence of EGFR and KRAS mutations in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinoma.Immunohistochemical expression of EGFR and HER3 was analysed in all primary tumours and a subset of lymph node metastases in a consecutive cohort of 174 patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach, cardia and esophagus. The anti-HER3 antibody used was validated by siRNA-mediated knockdown, immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR. EGFR and KRAS mutation status was analysed by pyrosequencing tecchnology.High EGFR expression was an independent risk factor for shorter overall survival (OS), whereas high HER3 expression was associated with a borderline significant trend towards a longer OS. KRAS mutations were present in only 4% of the tumours and had no prognostic impact. All tumours were EGFR wild-type. These findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to decide on the potential clinical value of different HERs and druggable mutations in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas, and attention is drawn to the need for more standardised investigational methods."

However, B1 cell-associated antibodies often cross-react with self-antigens, which leads to autoimmunity, and B1 cells have been implicated in cancer. How B1 cell activity is regulated remains unclear. We show that the Ikaros transcription factor is a major negative regulator of B1 cell development and function. Using conditional knock-out mouse models to delete Ikaros at different locations, we show that Ikaros-deficient mice exhibit specific and significant increases in splenic and bone marrow B1 cell numbers, and that the B1 progenitor cell pool is increased ∼10-fold in the bone marrow. Ikaros-null B1 cells resemble WT B1 cells at the molecular and cellular levels, but show a down-regulation of signaling components important for inhibiting proliferation and immunoglobulin production. Ikaros-null B1 cells hyper-react to TLR4 stimulation and secrete high amounts of IgM autoantibodies. These results indicate that Ikaros is required to limit B1 cell homeostasis in the adult.

Ikaros-null B1 cells hyper-react to TLR4 stimulation and secrete high amounts of IgM autoantibodies. These results indicate that Ikaros is required to limit B1 cell homeostasis in the adult. B1 B cells are an important part of the innate immune response because they spontaneously secrete natural, polyreactive IgM antibodies in the absence of infection (1.Manohar V. Brown E. Leiserson W.M. Chused T.M. Expression of Lyt-1 by a subset of B lymphocytes.J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 532-538PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Hayakawa K. Hardy R.R. Parks D.R. Herzenberg L.A.

In the mouse, they differ from conventional B2 B cells (follicular and marginal zone) in that they do not express CD21 and CD23, and express only low levels of B220 and IgD but high levels of IgM. B1 cells are abundant in the peritoneal and pleural cavities where they can be further divided into B1a (CD19+CD5+CD11b+) and B1b (CD19+CD5−CD11b+) cells. Splenic B1 cells are CD19+CD43+CD5+. The majority of B1 cells develop early in utero from fetal liver progenitor cells, and they are maintained over time in the adult through self-renewal. However, Lin−CD93+CD19+B220lo bone marrow B1 progenitor cells have been identified (3.Montecino-Rodriguez E. Leathers H. Dorshkind K. Identification of a B-1 B cell-specified progenitor.Nat.

Because natural antibodies are polyreactive, they also bind to self-antigens and contribute to autoimmunity, suggesting that B1 cells must be tightly regulated during homeostasis. In addition, because they comprise the first wave of B cell development, B1 cells may be linked to childhood leukemias. Work in recent years have begun to reveal a network of transcriptional regulators important for B1 cell development and function. Among them, members of the classical NFκB pathway (e.g. p50, Malt1, Carma1, Ikk complex), downstream of the BCR, have been shown to be essential for B1 cell development (6.Pedersen G.K. Adori M. Karlsson Hedestam G.B. NF-κB signaling in B-1 cell development.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2015; 1362: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The RNA-binding protein Lin28b, and its downstream effectors Let-7 and Arid3a, were revealed to promote fetal B1 cell lymphopoiesis (7.Yuan J. Nguyen C.K. Liu X. Kanellopoulou C. Muljo S.A.

Nechanitzky R. Mandel E. Pott S. Liu E. Grosschedl R.

Ermakova O. Graf T. PU.1 is not strictly required for B cell development and its absence induces a B-2 to B-1 cell switch.J. Exp.

Blimp1 (encoded by Prmd1) and Xbp1 are required for B1 (and B2) cell immunoglobulin secretion (14.Savitsky D. Calame K. B-1 B lymphocytes require Blimp-1 for immunoglobulin secretion.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), while Irf4 is required for IgM secretion by splenic B1 cells (15.Holodick N.E. Tumang J.R. Rothstein T.L.

Interestingly, NFκB, Lin28b/Let-7/Arid3a, Ebf1, Blimp1, and Xbp1 all work to positively regulate B1 cell development and function. Regulators that limit B1 cell activity are still poorly understood. Ikaros, encoded by the Ikzf1 gene, is a zinc finger DNA-binding protein, that is a key transcriptional regulator and tumor suppressor in B cells.

Ikaros was deleted in adult Ikf/f R26-CreERT2+ mice after daily intraperitoneal injections of tamoxifen (50 mg/kg weight of mouse, dissolved in sunflower oil) for 3 days. Female MRL/lpr mice were purchased from Harlan. FO B cells were sorted (B220+CD23hiCD21lo; >98% purity) on a FACSVantage S.E. option DiVa (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or a FACSAria II SORP (BD Biosciences), or enriched by depletion of CD43+ cells followed by positive selection of CD23+ cells with MACS beads (>90% purity; Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Both methods gave similar results. B1 B cells were sorted (CD19+CD43+) on a FACSAria II SORP (BD Biosciences). For BM cultures, 1 × 106 CD19+ BM B cells were co-cultured on S17 stromal cells in Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1× non-essential amino acids, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), 1% antibiotics plus cytokines IL-7 (7% of supernatant from mIL-7 cDNA-transfected J558L cells), SCF (10 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and Flt-3 ligand (2.5% of supernatant from mFlt3L cDNA-transfected B16 cells). For proliferation assays, cells were labeled with CFSE (5 μg/ml; Sigma) and 2.5–3 × 104 cells were cultured in complete medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1× non-essential amino acids, 50 μm 2-ME, 1% antibiotics). Cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgM F(ab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), 2–10 μg/ml mouse anti-CD40 (eBiosience, San Diego, CA), 10 ng/ml IL-4 (Peprotech), and 25 μg/ml LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4; Sigma). For intracellular staining cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and permeabilized with methanol. For cell viability assays, DiOC6 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added at 50 nm. For cell cycle staining, PFA fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin, and stained with anti-Ki67-AF700 (BD Biosciences) and DAPI (2 μg/ml). The following reagents were used: anti-B220-PE-Cy7, anti-CD19-PerCP-Cy5.5, anti-CD21-APC or -FITC, anti-CD23-PE-Cy7, anti-CD43-FITC, -PECy7 or -PE, anti-IgD-FITC, anti-CD11b-APC, anti-TCRαβ-biotin, anti-TCRγδ-biotin, and streptavidin (SA)-APC-Cy7 from BD Biosciences; anti-CD16/32, anti-CD23-biotin, anti-CD3ϵ-biotin, anti-CD71-biotin, anti-Gr-1-biotin, anti-NK1.1-biotin, anti-CD8-biotin, anti-CD5-biotin, anti-CD5-FITC, and anti-CD93-APC from eBioscience; anti-CD59-biotin from BMA Biomedical (Augst, Switzerland); anti-IgM-PE, -FITC or -APC, and SA-PE from Jackson ImmunoResearch; anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-biotin from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA); SA-Alexa Fluor 405 and anti-rat IgG-Qdot 605 from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Lin− cells were defined by staining with a mixture of antibodies for mature hematopoietic lineage marker including CD3ϵ, CD11b, CD59, CD71, Gr-1, NK1.1, TCRαβ, TCRγδ, CD8, and IgM. Cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur and FACS LSR II (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). ELISAs of sera were performed as described (33.Lacotte S. Dumortier H. Décossas M.

Briefly, polystyrene plates (MaxiSorb; Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated ON at 37 °C with the following antigens: dsDNA (100 ng/ml in 25 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.4; Sigma) and mouse chromatin extracted and purified from mouse lymphocytic leukemia cells L1210 (200 ng/ml expressed as dsDNA concentration in PBS, pH 7.2). Mouse sera (diluted 1:250 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (T) and 1% BSA) were added for 1 h, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:2 × 104 in PBS-T; Fcγ specific; Jackson ImmunoResearch) supplemented with goat anti-mouse IgG3 (diluted 1:7,500; Fcγ specific; Nordic Immunology, Tilburg, Netherlands) or by goat anti-mouse IgM (diluted 1:2 × 104; μ chain specific F(ab′)2; Jackson ImmunoResearch) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, H2O2 and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine were added as substrate and chromogen, respectively, for 15 min. The reaction was stopped, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. For ELISAs of cell culture supernatants, polystyrene plates (MaxiSorb; Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with the following antigens: salmon dsDNA (100 μg/ml in PBS, pH 7.2; Sigma) or mouse chromatin (15 μg/ml) extracted and purified from total mouse splenocytes as described (34.Huang J.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Plates were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 1h at 37 °C. Supernatants (undiluted) or mouse sera (diluted 1:250 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% BSA) were added for 2 h at room temperature followed by goat anti-mouse IgM (diluted 1:2 × 104; μ chain specific F(ab′)2; Jackson ImmunoResearch) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added as substrate for 20 min and the absorbance measured at 405 nm. Assays were performed by indirect immunofluorescence with HEp-2 cells (HEp-2 substrate slides; Zeus Scientific, Raritan, NJ). HEp-2 cell-coated slides were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with diluted sera, washed 2× in PBS and visualized by fluorescence microscopy with FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG or IgM (1:100). Controls included negative and positive sera from BALB/c and MRL/lpr mice, respectively. Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The following antibodies were used: anti-Ikaros (rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against the C terminus of Ikaros; in-house), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse HRP (Jackson Immunoresearch). Blots were revealed with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). RNA was reverse described with Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). RT-qPCR was performed with 1 cycle at 95 °C for 15 min, then 50 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C or 63 °C for 10 s and 72 °C for 15 s with SYBR Green PCR MasterMix (Sigma or Roche) on an LC480 light cycler (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).

RNA quality was verified with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Biotinylated single strand cDNA targets were prepared from 150 ng of total RNA with the Ambion WT Expression Kit and the Affymetrix GeneChip® WT Terminal Labeling Kit. After fragmentation and end-labeling, 1.9 μg of cDNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays using standard procedures. Raw data were processed with the Robust Multiarray Average (RMA) algorithm. Microarray data are available in the GEO Data Bank (GSE 75827). The ChIP protocol was adapted from the Millipore ChIP Assay Kit (17–295) with minor modifications and described (25.Oravecz A. Apostolov A. Polak K. Jost B. Le Gras S. Chan S. Kastner P.

After crosslinking, the chromatin was sonicated to 300–500 bp using a Bioruptor 200 (Diagenode, Denville, NJ) and cleared by centrifugation. After pre-cleaning with protein A-Sepharose, the lysate was incubated overnight with the anti-Ikaros antibody. Precipitation was carried out using protein A-magnetic beads. De-crosslinked DNA was purified using the iPure Kit (Diagenode). ChIP-sequencing was performed as described (25.Oravecz A. Apostolov A. Polak K. Jost B. Le Gras S. Chan S. Kastner P.

To evaluate mature B cell populations in vivo, we first analyzed IkL/L mice carrying a germline hypomorphic Ikzf1 mutation. IkL/L cells express functional Ikaros proteins at ∼10% of levels detected in WT cells (18.Kirstetter P. Thomas M. Dierich A. Kastner P. Chan S.

Although IkL/L mice die from T cell-acute lymphoblastic lymphomas/leukemias (T-ALL) at 4–6 months of age, the animals used here (6–8 weeks old) showed no signs of transformation in the thymus, as defined by CD4 and CD8 profiling, T cell receptor Vα and Vβ chain usage, and the absence of a deregulated Notch pathway (39.Dumortier A.

Deletion of the floxed Ikzf1 alleles at these stages did not grossly affect B cell differentiation in the BM, although Ikf/f CD19-Cre+ (CD19 cKO) mice showed an increase in pro- and large pre-B cells and a corresponding decrease in B220+CD43− cells, suggesting a bottleneck in differentiation, in line with the requirement for Ikaros in pre-B cell development (Fig. 1A) (22.Heizmann B. Kastner P. Chan S. Ikaros is absolutely required for pre-B cell differentiation by attenuating IL-7 signals.J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210: 2823-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the spleen, Ikaros proteins were detected in WT B cell populations (Fig. 1B) (22.Heizmann B. Kastner P. Chan S. Ikaros is absolutely required for pre-B cell differentiation by attenuating IL-7 signals.J. Exp.

Splenic B cell populations were analyzed in the different mutant mice by flow cytometry. While total splenocyte numbers were reduced in IkL/L mice, as previously described (18.Kirstetter P. Thomas M.

CD19+ B cells were also reduced in the IkL/L spleens but not in the cKO organs, suggesting that mature B cell numbers in general are not directly affected by Ikaros loss (Fig. 1D). Nonetheless, some B cell subsets were altered (Fig. 1, E and F). IkL/L spleens contained less CD19+CD21loCD23hi follicular (FO) but more CD19+CD21hiCD23lo marginal zone (MZ) B cells, while cKO spleens contained"
https://openalex.org/W2254259578,"In Candida albicans-infected resident peritoneal macrophages, activation of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2α) by calcium- and mitogen-activated protein kinases triggers the rapid production of prostaglandins I2 and E2 through cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and regulates gene expression by increasing cAMP. InC. albicans-infected cPLA2α(-/-)or COX-1(-/-)macrophages, expression ofI l10,Nr4a2, and Ptgs2 was lower, and expression ofTnfα was higher, than in wild type macrophages. Expression was reconstituted with 8-bromo-cAMP, the PKA activator 6-benzoyl-cAMP, and agonists for prostaglandin receptors IP, EP2, and EP4 in infected but not uninfected cPLA2α(-/-)or COX-1(-/-)macrophages. InC. albicans-infected cPLA2α(+/+)macrophages, COX-2 expression was blocked by IP, EP2, and EP4 receptor antagonists, indicating a role for both prostaglandin I2 and E2 Activation of ERKs and p38, but not JNKs, by C. albicansacted synergistically with prostaglandins to induce expression of Il10,Nr4a2, and Ptgs2. Tnfα expression required activation of ERKs and p38 but was suppressed by cAMP. Results using cAMP analogues that activate PKA or Epacs suggested that cAMP regulates gene expression through PKA. However, phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), the cAMP-regulated transcription factor involved inIl10,Nr4a2,Ptgs2, andTnfα expression, was not mediated by cAMP/PKA because it was similar inC. albicans-infected wild type and cPLA2α(-/-)or COX-1(-/-)macrophages. CREB phosphorylation was blocked by p38 inhibitors and induced by the p38 activator anisomycin but not by the PKA activator 6-benzoyl-cAMP. Therefore, MAPK activation inC. albicans-infected macrophages plays a dual role by promoting the cPLA2α/prostaglandin/cAMP/PKA pathway and CREB phosphorylation that coordinately regulate immediate early gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2264076065,"We present a new type of local image descriptor which yields binary patterns from small image patches. For the application to fingerprint liveness detection, we achieve rotation invariant image patches by taking the fingerprint segmentation and orientation field into account. We compute the discrete cosine transform (DCT) for these rotation invariant patches and attain binary patterns by comparing pairs of two DCT coefficients. These patterns are summarized into one or more histograms per image. Each histogram comprises the relative frequencies of pattern occurrences. Multiple histograms are concatenated and the resulting feature vector is used for image classification. We name this novel type of descriptor convolution comparison pattern (CCP). Experimental results show the usefulness of the proposed CCP descriptor for fingerprint liveness detection. CCP outperforms other local image descriptors such as LBP, LPQ and WLD on the LivDet 2013 benchmark. The CCP descriptor is a general type of local image descriptor which we expect to prove useful in areas beyond fingerprint liveness detection such as biological and medical image processing, texture recognition, face recognition and iris recognition, liveness detection for face and iris images, and machine vision for surface inspection and material classification."
https://openalex.org/W2256545277,"The successful reintroduction and restocking of the European Bison demands a reliable knowledge of the biology of this species. Yet little is known to date about the European bison, and empirical data remains insufficient to set up a reliable plan ensuring the reintroduction, maintenance and survival of populations in habitats that have been largely modified by human activity. Studies of the ecology, social behaviour and management of bison are therefore crucial to the conservation of this species and its cohabitation with humans. To meet these challenges, we focused on movement patterns and space use in a semi-free-ranging herd of European bison living in the Réserve Biologique des Monts-d'Azur (France). Bison spend over 80% of their time foraging and resting; foraging mainly occurs around the artificial feeding sites (i.e., hay racks) or in meadows. The time of day and the presence of snow have no influence on the time budget allocated to each activity. Animals, however, spend more time at the food racks in winter. Bison also spend most of their time in small groups of individuals, confirming the occurrence of both fission-fusion dynamics and sexual segregation in this species. Bison seem to follow a Lévy walk pattern of movement, which is probably related to the geographical distribution and size of food patches in the reserve. The conclusions of this study provide a better understanding of the sociality, life habits and habitat use of bison, and also describe how the provision of hay affects all these behaviours. These results could be useful in the development of tools to select the most suitable habitats for the reintroduction, management and conservation of bison populations."
https://openalex.org/W2258972840,"CD200:CD200 receptor (CD200R) interactions lead to potent immunosuppression and inhibition of autoimmune inflammation. We investigated the effect of ""knockout""of CD200 or CD200R, or over-expression of CD200, on susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Acute or chronic colitis was induced by administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in four groups of age-matched C57BL/6 female mice: (1) CD200-transgenic mice (CD200tg); (2) wild-type (WT) mice; (3) CD200 receptor 1-deficient (CD200R1KO) mice; and (4) CD200-deficient (CD200KO) mice. The extent of colitis was determined using a histological scoring system. Colon tissues were collected for quantitative RT-PCR and Immunohistochemical staining. Supernatants from colonic explant cultures and mononuclear cells isolated from colonic tissue were used for ELISA.CD200KO and CD200R1KO mice showed greater sensitivity to acute colitis than WT mice, with accelerated loss of body weight, significantly higher histological scores, more severe infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and CD3+ cells, and greater expression of macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokines, whose production was inhibited in vitro (in WT/CD200KO mouse cells) by CD200. In contrast, CD200tg mice showed less sensitivity to DSS compared with WT mice, with attenuation of all of the features seen in other groups. In a chronic colitis model, greater infiltration of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells was seen in the colon of CD200tg mice compared to WT mice, and anti-CD25 mAb given to these mice attenuated protection.The CD200:CD200R axis plays an immunoregulatory role in control of DSS induced colitis in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2252358884,"The common toad (Bufo bufo) is of increasing conservation concern in the United Kingdom (UK) due to dramatic population declines occurring in the past century. Many of these population declines coincided with reductions in both terrestrial and aquatic habitat availability and quality and have been primarily attributed to the effect of agricultural land conversion (of natural and semi-natural habitats to arable and pasture fields) and pond drainage. However, there is little evidence available to link habitat availability with common toad population declines, especially when examined at a broad landscape scale. Assessing such patterns of population declines at the landscape scale, for instance, require an understanding of how this species uses terrestrial habitat.We intensively studied the terrestrial resource selection of a large population of common toads in Oxfordshire, England, UK. Adult common toads were fitted with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to allow detection in the terrestrial environment using a portable PIT antenna once toads left the pond and before going into hibernation (April/May-October 2012 and 2013). We developed a population-level resource selection function (RSF) to assess the relative probability of toad occurrence in the terrestrial environment by collecting location data for 90 recaptured toads.The predicted relative probability of toad occurrence for this population was greatest in wooded habitat near to water bodies; relative probability of occurrence declined dramatically > 50 m from these habitats. Toads also tended to select habitat near to their breeding pond and toad occurrence was negatively related to urban environments."
https://openalex.org/W2256382122,"Flagellin has been tested as a protein-based vaccine adjuvant, with the majority of studies focused on antibody responses. Here, we evaluated the adjuvant activity of flagellin for both cellular and humoral immune responses in BALB/c mice in the setting of gene-based immunization, and have made several novel observations. DNA vaccines and adenovirus (Ad) vectors were engineered to encode mycobacterial protein Ag85B, with or without flagellin of Salmonella typhimurium (FliC). DNA-encoded flagellin given IM enhanced splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to co-expressed vaccine antigen, including memory responses. Boosting either IM or intranasally with Ad vectors expressing Ag85B without flagellin led to durable enhancement of Ag85B-specific antibody and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both spleen and pulmonary tissues, correlating with significantly improved protection against challenge with pathogenic aerosolized M. tuberculosis. However, inclusion of flagellin in both DNA prime and Ad booster vaccines induced localized pulmonary inflammation and transient weight loss, with route-dependent effects on vaccine-induced T cell immunity. The latter included marked reductions in levels of mucosal CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses following IM DNA/IN Ad mucosal prime-boosting, although antibody responses were not diminished. These findings indicate that flagellin has differential and route-dependent adjuvant activity when included as a component of systemic or mucosally-delivered gene-based prime-boost immunization. Clear adjuvant activity for both T and B cell responses was observed when flagellin was included in the DNA priming vaccine, but side effects occurred when given in an Ad boosting vector, particularly via the pulmonary route."

We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988–2010 with linked mortality files from 1988–2011. We employed weighted Cox models to test and adjust for these two selection biases. We also used complementary log-log models, adjusted for a normal distribution of frailty, to test for mortality selection effects; accelerated failure-time models to mitigate the mortality selection effect; and ordinary least squares regression to test for healthy participant effects. The link between class II/III obesity and mortality weakens at older ages. We did not find evidence for significant mortality selection or healthy participant effects. Also, even if the healthy participant effects were stronger among obese adults, they are not strong enough to produce a weakening association between obesity and morbidity at higher ages at the time of the survey. Therefore, neither of these selection biases explains the diminishing effect of class II/III obesity on mortality over the life course."
https://openalex.org/W2259789039,"The E3 transcription unit of human species C adenoviruses (Ads) encodes immunomodulatory proteins that mediate direct protection of infected cells. Recently, we described a novel immunomodulatory function for E3/49K, an E3 protein uniquely expressed by species D Ads. E3/49K of Ad19a/Ad64, a serotype that causes epidemic keratokonjunctivitis, is synthesized as a highly glycosylated type I transmembrane protein that is subsequently cleaved, resulting in secretion of its large ectodomain (sec49K). sec49K binds to CD45 on leukocytes, impairing activation and functions of natural killer cells and T cells. E3/49K is localized in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN), in the early endosomes, and on the plasma membrane, yet the cellular compartment where E3/49K is cleaved and the protease involved remained elusive. Here we show that TGN-localized E3/49K comprises both newly synthesized and recycled molecules. Full-length E3/49K was not detected in late endosomes/lysosomes, but the C-terminal fragment accumulated in this compartment at late times of infection. Inhibitor studies showed that cleavage occurs in a post-TGN compartment and that lysosomotropic agents enhance secretion. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic tail of E3/49K contains two potential sorting motifs, YXXΦ (where Φ represents a bulky hydrophobic amino acid) and LL, that are important for binding the clathrin adaptor proteins AP-1 and AP-2in vitro Surprisingly, mutating the LL motif, either alone or together with YXXΦ, did not prevent proteolytic processing but increased cell surface expression and secretion. Upon brefeldin A treatment, cell surface expression was rapidly lost, even for mutants lacking all known endocytosis motifs. Together with immunofluorescence data, we propose a model for intracellular E3/49K transport whereby cleavage takes place on the cell surface by matrix metalloproteases."
https://openalex.org/W2263296707,"Early diagnosis of low grade glioma has been a challenge to clinicians. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using 18F-FDG as a radio-tracer has limited utility in this area because of the high background in normal brain tissue. Other radiotracers such as 18F-Fluorocholine (18F-FCH) could provide better contrast between tumor and normal brain tissue but with high incidence of false positives. In this study, the potential application of a dual tracer 18F-FCH/18F-FDG-PET is investigated in order to improve the sensitivity of PET imaging for low grade glioma diagnosis based on a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. BALB/c nude mice with and without orthotopic glioma xenografts from U87 MG-luc2 glioma cell line are used for the study. The animals are subjected to 18F-FCH and 18F-FDG PET imaging, and images acquired from two separate scans are superimposed for analysis. The 18F-FCH counts are subtracted from the merged images to identify the tumor. Micro-CT, bioluminescence imaging (BLI), histology and measurement of the tumor diameter are also conducted for comparison. Results show that there is a significant contrast in 18F-FCH uptake between tumor and normal brain tissue (2.65 ± 0.98), but with a high false positive rate of 28.6%. The difficulty of identifying the tumor by 18F-FDG only is also proved in this study. All the tumors can be detected based on the dual tracer technique of 18F-FCH/18F-FDG-PET imaging in this study, while the false-positive caused by 18F-FCH can be eliminated. Dual tracer 18F-FCH/18F-FDG PET imaging has the potential to improve the visualization of low grade glioma. 18F-FCH delineates tumor areas and the tumor can be identified by subtracting the 18F-FCH counts. The sensitivity was over 95%. Further studies are required to evaluate the possibility of applying this technique in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2255237541,"Cerebral Malaria (CM) is associated with a pathogenic T cell response. Mice infected by P. berghei ANKA clone 1.49 (PbA) developing CM (CM+) present an altered PBL TCR repertoire, partly due to recurrently expanded T cell clones, as compared to non-infected and CM- infected mice. To analyse the relationship between repertoire alteration and CM, we performed a kinetic analysis of the TRBV repertoire during the course of the infection until CM-related death in PbA-infected mice. The repertoires of PBL, splenocytes and brain lymphocytes were compared between infected and non-infected mice using a high-throughput CDR3 spectratyping method. We observed a modification of the whole TCR repertoire in the spleen and blood of infected mice, from the fifth and the sixth day post-infection, respectively, while only three TRBV were significantly perturbed in the brain of infected mice. Using multivariate analysis and statistical modelling, we identified a unique TCRβ signature discriminating CM+ from CTR mice, enriched during the course of the infection in the spleen and the blood and predicting CM onset. These results highlight a dynamic modification and compartmentalization of the TCR diversity during the course of PbA infection, and provide a novel method to identify disease-associated TCRβ signature as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2256959858,"The bradykinin (BK) B1 receptor (B1R) is a peculiar G protein coupled receptor that is strongly regulated to the point of being inducible in immunopathology. Limited clinical evidence suggests that its expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is a biomarker of active inflammatory states. In an effort to develop a novel imaging/diagnostic tool, we report the rational design and testing of a fusion protein that is a ligand of the human B1R but not likely to label peptidases. This ligand is composed of a fluorescent protein (FP) (enhanced green FP [EGFP] or mCherry) prolonged at its N-terminus by a spacer peptide and a classical peptide agonist or antagonist (des-Arg9-BK, [Leu8]des-Arg9-BK, respectively). The design of the spacer-ligand joint peptide was validated by a competition assay for [3H]Lys-des-Arg9-BK binding to the human B1R applied to 4 synthetic peptides of 18 or 19 residues. The labeling of B1R-expressing cells with EGFP or mCherry fused with 7 of such peptides was performed in parallel (microscopy). Both assays indicated that the best design was FP-(Asn-Gly)n-Lys-des-Arg9-BK; n = 15 was superior to n = 5, suggesting benefits from minimizing steric hindrance between the FP and the receptor. Cell labeling concerned mostly plasma membranes and was inhibited by a B1R antagonist. EGFP-(Asn-Gly)15-Lys-des-Arg9-BK competed for the binding of [3H]Lys-des-Arg9-BK to human recombinant B1R, being only 10-fold less potent than the unlabeled form of Lys-des-Arg9-BK to do so. The fusion protein did not label HEK 293a cells expressing recombinant human BK B2 receptors or angiotensin converting enzyme. This study identifies a modular C-terminal sequence that can be adapted to protein cargoes, conferring high affinity for the BK B1R, with possible applications in diagnostic cytofluorometry, histology and drug delivery (e.g., in oncology)."
https://openalex.org/W2259197398,"Objective The study investigates the effect on cooperation in multiplayer games, when the population from which all individuals are drawn is structured—i.e. when a given individual is only competing with a small subset of the entire population. Method To optimize the focus on multiplayer effects, a class of games were chosen for which the payoff depends nonlinearly on the number of cooperators—this ensures that the game cannot be represented as a sum of pair-wise interactions, and increases the likelihood of observing behaviour different from that seen in two-player games. The chosen class of games are named “threshold games”, and are defined by a threshold, M > 0, which describes the minimal number of cooperators in a given match required for all the participants to receive a benefit. The model was studied primarily through numerical simulations of large populations of individuals, each with interaction neighbourhoods described by various classes of networks. Results When comparing the level of cooperation in a structured population to the mean-field model, we find that most types of structure lead to a decrease in cooperation. This is both interesting and novel, simply due to the generality and breadth of relevance of the model—it is likely that any model with similar payoff structure exhibits related behaviour. More importantly, we find that the details of the behaviour depends to a large extent on the size of the immediate neighbourhoods of the individuals, as dictated by the network structure. In effect, the players behave as if they are part of a much smaller, fully mixed, population, which we suggest an expression for."
https://openalex.org/W2259634173,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are two clinically distinct neurodevelopmental disorders caused by absence of paternally or maternally expressed imprinted genes on chr15q11.2-q13.3. Three mechanisms are known to be involved in the pathogenesis: microdeletions, uniparental disomy (UPD) and imprinting defects. Both disorders are difficult to be definitely diagnosed at early age if no available molecular cytogenetic tests. In this study, we identified 5 AS patients with the maternal deletion and 26 PWS patients with paternal deletion on chr15q11-q13 by using an innovative multiplex-fluorescent-labeled short tandem repeats (STRs) assay based on linkage analysis, and validated by the methylation-specific PCR and array comparative genomic hybridization techniques. More interesting, one of these PWS patients was confirmed as maternal uniparental isodisomy by the STR linkage analysis. The phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of these individuals were also presented. Our results indicate that the new linkage analysis is much faster and easier for large-scale screening deletion and uniparental disomy, thus providing a valuable method for early diagnosis of PWS/AS patients, which is critical for genetic diagnosis, management and improvement of prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2252302924,"Layer 4 (L4) of primary visual cortex (V1) is the main recipient of thalamocortical fibers from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd). Thus, it is considered the main entry point of visual information into the neocortex and the first anatomical opportunity for intracortical visual processing before information leaves L4 and reaches supra- and infragranular cortical layers. The strength of monosynaptic connections from individual L4 excitatory cells onto adjacent L4 cells (unitary connections) is highly malleable, demonstrating that the initial stage of intracortical synaptic transmission of thalamocortical information can be altered by previous activity. However, the inhibitory network within L4 of V1 may act as an internal gate for induction of excitatory synaptic plasticity, thus providing either high fidelity throughput to supragranular layers or transmittal of a modified signal subject to recent activity-dependent plasticity. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the induction of synaptic plasticity using classical extracellular stimulation protocols that recruit a combination of excitatory and inhibitory synapses with stimulation of a single excitatory neuron onto a L4 cell. In order to induce plasticity, we paired pre- and postsynaptic activity (with the onset of postsynaptic spiking leading the presynaptic activation by 10ms) using extracellular stimulation (ECS) in acute slices of primary visual cortex and comparing the outcomes with our previously published results in which an identical protocol was used to induce synaptic plasticity between individual pre- and postsynaptic L4 excitatory neurons. Our results indicate that pairing of ECS with spiking in a L4 neuron fails to induce plasticity in L4-L4 connections if synaptic inhibition is intact. However, application of a similar pairing protocol under GABAARs inhibition by bath application of 2μM bicuculline does induce robust synaptic plasticity, long term potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD), similar to our results with pairing of pre- and postsynaptic activation between individual excitatory L4 neurons in which inhibitory connections are not activated. These results are consistent with the well-established observation that inhibition limits the capacity for induction of plasticity at excitatory synapses and that pre- and postsynaptic activation at a fixed time interval can result in a variable range of plasticity outcomes. However, in the current study by virtue of having two sets of experimental data, we have provided a new insight into these processes. By randomly mixing the assorting of individual L4 neurons according to the frequency distribution of the experimentally determined plasticity outcome distribution based on the calculated convergence of multiple individual L4 neurons onto a single postsynaptic L4 neuron, we were able to compare then actual ECS plasticity outcomes to those predicted by randomly mixing individual pairs of neurons. Interestingly, the observed plasticity profiles with ECS cannot account for the random assortment of plasticity behaviors of synaptic connections between individual cell pairs. These results suggest that connections impinging onto a single postsynaptic cell may be grouped according to plasticity states."
https://openalex.org/W2253023467,"Background/Objective RAC1 gene could influence susceptibility to renal failure by altering the activity and expression of Rac1, which is a member of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins. In clinical practice, renal transplantation provides the optimal treatment for people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The objective of this present study was to determine whether the RAC1 gene polymorphisms were associated with primary ESRD susceptibility in Chinese renal recipients. Methods Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of RAC1 gene, including rs836488 T>C, rs702482 A>T, rs10951982 G>A, rs702483 A>G, rs6954996 G>A, and rs9374 G>A, were genotyped in 300 renal transplant recipients (cases) and 998 healthy Chinese subjects (controls) by using TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies of the six SNPs were compared between cases and controls. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated in logistic regression models to evaluate the associations of the six SNPs with ESRD risk. Results The genotype distributions for the six SNPs in controls were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). Association analysis revealed that three SNPs were significantly associated with ESRD risk. Positive associations with ESRD risk were found for the rs836488, rs702482, and rs702483 in the co-dominant model (minor allele homozygotes versus major allele homozygotes); specifically, the frequencies of the minor allele homozygotes and the minor allele for the three SNPs were higher in the cases than in the controls. In addition, these three SNPs also had associations with increased ESRD risk under the additive model (P < 0.05), and positive associations were also found for the rs836488 in the dominant model (P < 0.05) and for the rs702483 in the recessive model (P < 0.05). All these associations were independent of confounding factors. The other three SNPs (rs10951982, rs6954996, and rs9374), in all comparison models, were not associated with ESRD risk (P > 0.05). In haplotype analysis, carriers with ""C-T-G-G-G-G"" haplotype had a significantly higher risk of ESRD compared with the most common haplotype ""T-A-G-A-G-G"" (P = 0.011, OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.09–1.94). Conclusion This study suggested that polymorphisms of RAC1 gene might influence the susceptibility to ESRD in Chinese Han population. Further studies are necessary to confirm our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2262635909,"Gonadal maturation is an extremely energy consuming process for batch spawners and it is associated with a significant decrease in growth and seasonal deterioration in flesh quality. Our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms linking sexual maturation and muscle growth is still limited. In the present study, we performed RNA-Seq using 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing in fast skeletal muscle sampled from two-year-old Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) at representative time points throughout the reproductive cycle (August, March and May). In total, 126,937 good quality reads were obtained, with 546 nucleotide length and 52% GC content on average. RNA-Seq analysis using the CLC Genomics Workbench with the Atlantic cod reference UniGene cDNA data revealed 59,581 (46.9%) uniquely annotated reads. Pairwise comparison for expression levels identified 153 differentially expressed UniGenes between time points. Notably, we found a significant suppression of myh13 and myofibrillar gene isoforms in fast skeletal muscle during the spawning season. This study uncovered a large number of differentially expressed genes that may be influenced by gonadal maturation, thus representing a significant contribution to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating muscle wasting and regeneration in batch spawners during their reproductive cycle."
