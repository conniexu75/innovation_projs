https://openalex.org/W1556616823,"Abstract Casein kinase II, a cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase from rabbit reticulocytes, was shown to be inhibited by heparin. Heparin specifically inhibited the enzyme and had no effect on other protein kinases, including casein kinase I, the type I and II cAMP-dependent protein kinases, protease-activated kinase I, and the hemin-controlled repressor. Heparan sulfate was found to be 40-fold less effective than heparin towards casein kinase II; other acid mucopolysaccharides had little or no effect on the enzymatic activity. Steady state studies revealed that heparin acted as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the substrate, casein. A value of 20 ng/ml or about 1.4 nM was obtained for the apparent Ki. The inhibition was not reversed by ATP and varying the ATP and heparin concentrations in the assay only altered the maximum velocity."
https://openalex.org/W1524312435,"The kinetics of inhibition of four hemostatic system enzymes by antithrombin were examined as a function of heparin concentration. Plots of the initial velocity of factor Xa-antithrombin or plasmin-antithrombin interaction versus the level of added mucopolysaccharide exhibit an ascending limb and subsequent plateau regions. In each case, the kinetic profile is closely correlated with the concentration of the heparin . antithrombin complex formed within the reaction mixture. A decrease in the velocity of inhibition is not observed at high levels of added mucopolysaccharide despite the generation of significant quantities of heparin-enzyme interaction products. The second-order rate constants for the neutralization of factor Xa or plasmin by the mucopolysaccharide . inhibitor complex are 2.4 x 10(8) M-1 min-1 and 4.0 x 10(6) M-1 min-1, respectively. These parameters must be contrasted with the similarly designated constants obtained in the absence of heparin which are 1.88 x 10(5) M-1 min-1 and 4.0 x 10(4) M-1 min-1, respectively. Plots of the initial velocity of the factor IXa-antithrombin or the thrombin-antithrombin interaction versus the level of added mucopolysaccharide exhibit an ascending limb, pseudoplateau, descending limb, and final plateau regions. In each case, the ascending limb and pseudoplateau are closely correlated with the concentration of heparin c antithrombin complex formed within the reaction mixture. Furthermore, the descending limb and final plateau of these two processes coincide with the generation of increasing amounts of the respective mucopolysaccharide-enzyme interaction products. The second-order rate constants for the neutralization of factor IXa or thrombin by the heparin . antithrombin complex are 3.0 x 10(8) M-1 min-1 and 1.7 x 10(9) M-1 min-1, respectively. The second-order rate constants for the inhibition of mucopolysaccharide-factor IXa or mucopolysaccharide-thrombin interaction products by the heparin . antithrombin complex are 2.0 x 10(7) M-1 min-1 and 3.0 x 10(8) M-1 min-1, respectively. These kinetic parameters must be contrasted with similarly designated constants obtained in the absence of mucopolysaccharide which are 2.94 x 10(4) M-1 min-1 and 4.25 x 10(5) M-1 min-1, respectively. Thus, our data demonstrate that binding of heparin to antithrombin is required for the mucopolysaccharide-dependent enhancement in the rates of neutralization of thrombin, factor IXa, factor Xa, or plasmin by the protease inhibitor. Furthermore, a careful comparison of the various constants suggests that the direct interaction between heparin and antithrombin may be largely responsible for the kinetic effect of this mucopolysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1977036272,"Synthesis and secretion of beta-lactamase were studied in Salmonella typhimurium infected with P22 phage carrying the structural gene for beta-lactamase (the bla gene) in mutant or wild-type form. The wild-type gene was shown to specify two forms of beta-lactamase which differ in molecular weight by about 2500 daltons. This difference is consistent with removal, predicted on other grounds, of 23 amino-terminal residues (the ""signal"" sequence). All bla- mutants, including chain-terminating mutants lacking as much as 50% or as little as 10% of the protein, were apparently unaffected in this processing step. Pulse-chase experiments showed that more than 85% of the wild-type (as well as mutant) proteins are synthesized as complete overlength precursors before being processed to their mature forms. Virtually all the mature wild-type protein appears in the periplasmic space whereas a large fraction of the precursor appears in the cytoplasm. In contrast, both the precursor and processed forms of beta-lactamase proteins synthesized by chain-terminating mutants (including one which lacks only 10% of its residues from the carboxy end) are not secreted and apparently remain soluble in the cytoplasm. These results show that the carboxy-terminal amino acid sequence (at least) of beta-lactamase is essential to successful transport across the cytoplasmic membrane, and suggest that the presence (and probably also the act of removal) of the signal sequence does not suffice to ensure secretion."

https://openalex.org/W1731782390,"An acid slab gel electrophoresis method of high-resolving power allows detection of a phosphorylated form in the purified ATPase of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and identification of this catalytic intermediate among the different phosphopeptides of a plasma membrane preparation. At a maximum steady state rate of MgATP hydrolysis by the membrane-bound ATPase, 20 to 40% of the ATPase subunits of 100,000 daltons are in a phosphorylated form, while only 0.8% of the subunits of the purified ATPase are phosphorylated under the same conditions. The phosphorylated intermediate reaches the steady state level in less than 2 s and rapidly turns over. The phosphorylated substance is cleaved by hydroxylamine and is relatively stable in acids but is readily hydrolyzed in alkaline or in acid alcoholic media. These results suggest that the intermediate is an acylphosphate. The phosphorylation reaction has an apparent Km value of 3.0 mM MgATP for the plasma membrane-bound ATPase and 0.6 mM MgATP for the purified ATPase. Plasma membranes contain several other minor phosphorylated components whose kinetic behavior is typical of phosphorylation by protein kinase. Artifactual production of two forms of the ATPase by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride-sensitive proteases liberated during cell disruption is also demonstrated."

https://openalex.org/W1573412678,"Incubation of rabbit skeletal myosin with an extract of light chain kinase plus ATP phosphorylated the L2 light chain and modified the steady state kinetics of the actomyosin ATPase. With regulated actin, the ATPase activity of phosphorylated myosin (P-myosin) was 35 to 181% greater than that of unphosphorylated myosin when assayed with 0.05 to 5 micro M Ca2+. Phosphorylation had no effect on the Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal activity, but it did increase the ATPase activity at low Ca2+. With pure actin, the percentage of increase in the actomyosin ATPase activity correlated with the percentage of phosphorylation of myosin. Steady state kinetic analyses of the actomyosin system indicated that 50 to 82% phosphorylation of myosin decreased significantly the Kapp of actin for myosin with no significant effect on the Vmax. Phosphorylaton of heavy meromyosin similarly modified the steady state kinetics of the acto-heavy meromyosin system. Both the K+/EDTA- and Mg-ATPase activities of P-myosin and phosphorylated heavy meromyosin were within normal limits indicating that phosphorylaiion had not altered significantly the hydrolytic site. Phosphatase treatment of P-myosin decreased both the level of phosphorylation of L2 and the actomyosin ATPase activity to control levels for unphosphorylated myosin. It is concluded levels for unphosphorylated myosin. It is concluded from these results that the ability of P-myosin to modify the steady state kinetics of the actomyosin ATPase was: 1) specific for phosphorylation; 2) independent of the thin filament regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1540954091,"Experiments were undertaken to examine the fate and composition of polypeptides synthesized on cytoplasmic polysomes associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mitochondria with their associated cytoplasmic polysomes were isolated from growing yeast spheroplasts and placed in a polypeptide chain completion system together with [35S]methionine. Of the total products synthesized in the readout system, 80 to 85% remain associated with the mitochondria after sucrose gradient centrifugation. Most of the labeled products are resistant to papain digestion unless the membranes are disrupted by treatment with detergent or shaking with glass beads. When free cytoplasmic polysomes were translated in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with mitochondria, only about 20% of the labeled polypeptides remain associated with the mitochondria; furthermore, most of these products are equally sensitive to papain digestion in the presence or absence of detergent. These results support the view that the cytoplasmic polysomes associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane of yeast facilitate the segregation of newly synthesized proteins into the organelle. The proportion of the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of the F1-ATPase was determined among the products synthesized by mitochondria-bound and free cytoplasmic polysomes. By double antibody precipitation and immunoreplicate electrophoresis, we find that the proportion of the subunits of F1-ATPase is much greater among the products of the mitochondria-bound polysomes than those synthesized on free polysomes."
https://openalex.org/W1608119064,"A low molecular weight preparation of porcine heparin (specific anticoagulation activity = 125 units/mg) was fractionated to obtain a mucopolysaccharide product of 6500 daltons (specific anticoagulant activity = 373 units/mg) that is homogeneous with respect to its interaction with antithrombin. This material was treated with fluorescamine in order to introduce a fluorescent tag into the mucopolysaccharide. Initially, we showed that the fluorescamine-heparin conjugate and the unlabeled mucopolysaccharide interacted with antithrombin in a virtually identical fashion. Subsequently, we demonstrated that labeled heparin could be utilized in conjunction with fluorescence polarization spectroscopy to monitor the binding of mucopolysaccharide to thrombin, factor IXa, factor Xa, and plasmin. The interaction of this complex carbohydrate with thrombin exhibited a stoichiometry of 2:1 with KH1T DISS = KH2T DISS = 8 x 10(-7) M. The formation of mucopolysaccharide . factor IXa complex is characterized by a stoichiometry of 1:1 with KHIXa DISS = 2.58 x 10(-7) M. The binding of heparin to factor Xa or plasmin occurred with low avidity. Therefore, the stoichiometries of these processes could not be established. However, our experimental data were compatible with a single-site binding residue with KHXa DISS = 8.73 x 10(-6) M and KHPL DISS = approximately 1 x 10(-4) M, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2139719160,"The plasma membrane ATPase of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe solubilized by lysolecithin and purified by centrifugation through a sucrose gradient is essentially inactive. The phospholipid distribution in the sucrose gradient indicates that inactivation of the ATPase may result from the partial delipidation occurring during purification. Taking into account the 100,000 daltons of the ATPase polypeptide, it is concluded that 74 mol of phospholipids are bound per mol of purified ATP monomer. The ATPase so purified is reactivated simply by mixing the enzyme with preformed lipid micelles or vesicles. Lysolecithins reactivate the enzyme at concentrations around the critical micellar concentration. Gel exclusion chromatography indicates that the enzyme binds reversibly to the lysolecithin micelles. On the other hand, lecithins of varying chain length and unsaturation reactivate the enzyme to different extents and with different efficiencies. In addition, from binding studies, it is observed that each saturated lecithin combines equally well with the ATPase. Using other diacylphospholipids no specificity for the polar head group is observed. Moreover, cardiolipin microvesicles is shown to bind all the protein but not to restore the enzyme activity. From lipid-reactivation titration curves. Arrhenius plots, and physical data of the phospholipids, it is concluded that the major parameter which governs the optimal reactivation of ATPase is the ability of the phospholipids to form amphipathic structures (micelles or vesicles) of sufficient fluidity and hydrophobicity. From these results, a coherent description can be provided for the protein-lipid interactions occurring during solubilization, purification, and the lipid reactivation of the yeast plasma membrane ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1561636118,"Abstract The accuracy with which Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Pol I) copies natural DNA in vitro has been determined. When phi X174 viral DNA containing an amber mutation (am3) is primed with a single restriction endonuclease fragment, copied in vitro with Pol I and then expressed in E. coli spheroplasts (Weymout, L. A., and Loeb, L. A. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 1924), the reversion frequency of this DNA is greater than that of uncopied DNA. This change in reversion frequency can be increased by selectively increasing the concentration of either dATP or dCTP relative to the other deoxyribonucleotide substrates. DNA sequence analyses of revertants obtained from substrate pool bias experiments demonstrates that the revertants contain the selectively biased nucleotide as an incorrect substitution at position 587 of the am3 codon. We have analyzed the product of the in vitro Pol I reaction using neutral and alkaline sucrose gradients. Fifty per cent of the input phi X174 DNA template molecules are copied past the am3 site. The phenotypic expression of the product (revertant) strand in the spheroplast assay was estimated using a model heteroduplex molecule similar in structure to the product of the reaction and containing a single base mismatch (A:A or A:C) at position 587. Using these data, and by extrapolation from pool bias experiments, we estimate the error rate of Pol I in Mg2+-activated reactions using equimolar concentrations of the four deoxynucleotide substrates is 1/680,000 for an A:C mispair and < 1/6,300,000 for an A:A mispair at position 587 of the am3 codon in phi X174 DNA."

Proton-conducting activity was monitored by fluorometry with 9-aminoacridine as an indicator of delta pH in K+-loaded liposomes suspended in a K+-free medium. Addition of valinomycin served to create a membrane potential. Proton mediation was further followed potentiometrically with a pH electrode. Reconstituted chloroplast DCCD-binding proteolipid rapidly catalyzed passive proton movement as measured by the quenching of 9-aminoacridine fluorescence upon addition of valinomycin to K+-loaded vesicles. Proton translocation was inhibited to approximately 80% by hydrophobic dicyclohexylcarbodiimide but not its water-soluble analog (1-ethyl-3[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide). Maximal inhibition by DCCD occurred after 60 min of incubation with 20 to 40 nmol of DCCD/20 nmol of proteolipid/10 mumol of lipid. The velocity of proton conduction increased when the external proton concentration in the medium was increased. Similar data were obtained using a pH electrode to follow proton movement. Subjection of proteolipid liposomes to tetranitromethane, resulting in nitration of tyrosine, markedly reduced proton conduction (62% inhibition). In a similar fashion preincubation of reconstituted vesicles with hydrophobic phenylisothiocyanate at neutral pH resulted in a decreased rate of proton movement (50% inhibition) while hydrophilic p-sulfophenylisothiocyanate appeared to have no effect."
https://openalex.org/W2090742272,"Abstract The mutation int -h3 maps in the int gene of coliphage λ and results in the synthesis of an integrase with enhanced activity, which is manifested by an ability to support λ site-specific recombination relatively efficiently under conditions where the wild-type integrase functions inefficiently. The level of site-specific recombination seen in the presence of the int + integrase in him A − hosts is greatly reduced, as measured by lysogen formation, intramolecular site-specific integration and excision, and excision of a cryptic λ prophage. In contrast, the int -h3 integrase shows relatively high levels of activities under these conditions. Int -h3 is also more active in other host mutants ( him B and hip ) that reduce λ site-specific recombination. In the absence of the normal att B site, the frequency of lysogen formation (at secondary sites) by λ int + is reduced 200 fold. Although λ int -h3 will integrate preferentially at the att B site if it is present, the mutant phage forms lysogens at a high frequency in att B-deleted hosts. λ int -h3 requires him A function for integration at secondary sites. The fact that the int -h3 integrase uses the same att sites as well as the same host functions as the int + integrase suggests that the mutation results in a quantitative rather than a qualitative change in integrase activity; that is, the int -h3 integrase is more active. The mutant integrase supports site-specific recombination with att sites that carry the att 24 mutation. We propose that the int -h3 integrase is endowed with an enhanced ability to recognize att sequences, including some that are not effectively recognized by wild-type integrase."

The configuration of this product showed that the hydrolysis proceeds with inversion at the transferred phosphoric residue. This result suggests a direct, in-line hydrolysis mechanism for the ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1659808216,"Abstract By double isotope pulse-labeling of yeast cells, we determined the kinetics of labeling at 9 degrees C of total mitochondrial membrane, mitochondrial matrix, and cytosolic proteins, the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of F1 ATPase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. We find that none of the mitochondrial proteins show a lag in the incorporation of label compared to cytosolic proteins. These results argue against the existence in the cytosol of large pools of mitochondrial proteins awaiting transport into the organelle. Cycloheximide addition during the pulse stops [35S]methionine incorporation into mitochondrial membrane and cytosolic proteins rapidly (approximately 1 min) and with identical kinetics. Compared to cytosolic protein, however, there is a persistent incorporation of label into mitochondria after a chase with cold methionine (t1/2 approximately 1.5 min at 9 degrees C) which cannot be accounted for solely by chain completion. We conclude that this continued incorporation reflects some transport process in addition to a completion of a round of translation. When cells are labeled during a synchronous restart of protein synthesis, where ribosome run-off from mRNA was first induced either by incubating cells for 4 h at 0 degrees C or by treatment with 5 mM aurintricarboxylic acid, the initial rate of incorporation of label into mitochondrial protein now lags behind that of cytosolic proteins. From these results and those in the accompanying report (Ades, I.Z., and Butow, R.A. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9918-9924) we propose that the translation of mRNA specific for mitochondrial proteins takes place in the cytoplasm and that at least a portion of the polysomes are then transported and bind to the outer mitochondrial membrane, followed by completion of translation and transfer of the newly synthesized polypeptides into the mitochondria. From a consideration of all of the available data on protein transport into mitochondria in yeast, we conclude that cytoplasmic polysomes bound to the outer mitochondrial membrane function in the transport of proteins into mitochondria by a process not necessarily mutually exclusive of post-translational transport."

https://openalex.org/W1577661369,"The influence of polyethylene glycols on the kinetics of purified rat liver phosphofructokinase was examined because polyethylene glycol often has an associative influence on proteins without specifically interacting with them. Polyethylene glycol was found to prevent or slow the spontaneous inactivation, due to subunit dissociation, of rat liver phosphofructokinase which occurs at low protein concentration (10 microgram/ml) in an isotonic, pH 7 buffer in the absence of substrates. This protection is favored by increasing size and concentration of polyethylene glycol. Inclusion of polyethylene glycol in kinetic assays of rat liver phosphofructokinase had little effect on maximal velocity determined under optimal conditions at pH 8. However, the Km value for fructose 6-phosphate measured at pH 7 and 3 mM MgATP was dramatically lowered with increasing polyethylene glycol concentration. The results support the proposal that more aggregated forms of rat liver phosphofructokinase have a decreased Km value for fructose 6-phosphate when assayed with inhibiting concentrations of MgATP."

It is shown, in contrast to previous observations with aggregated and insoluble myosin, that the kinetic behavior of actomyosin is similar to that of acto-heavy meromyosin. Owing to their size, solubility, and stability under conditions of the actin-activated ATPase measurements, the minifilaments provide a well defined experimental system.

https://openalex.org/W1547762530,"Yeast phosphofructokinase contains 83 +/- 2 cysteinyl residues/enzyme oligomer. On the basis of their reactivity toward 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), the accessible cysteinyl residues of the native enzyme may be classified into three groups. For titrations performed with N-ethylmaleimide, subdivisional classes of reactivity are evidenced. In each case, the 6 to 8 most reactive cysteines are not protected by fructose 6-phosphate from chemical labeling and do not seem involved in subsequent enzyme inactivation. Differential labeling studies as well as direct protection experiments in the presence of fructose 6-phosphate, indicate that 12 -SH groups/enzyme oligomer (i.e. three -SH groups per binding site) are protected by the allosteric substrate from the chemical modification. Specific labeling by the differential method of the cysteinyl residues protected by fructose 6-phosphate and further separation of the two types of subunits constituting yeast phosphofructokinase, show that the substrate binding sites are localized exclusively on subunits of beta type. Thus, alpha subunits are not implicated directly in the catalytic mechanism of yeast phosphofructokinase reaction."

A comparison of myosins isolated from swine carotid arteries and mixed (leg and back) rabbit skeletal muscle was conducted in the presence and absence of rabbit skeletal actin. It was found that (i) arterial myosin, like skeletal myosin, exhibited hyperbolic kinetics for ATP hydrolysis, (ii) specific ATPase activities were significantly higher for skeletal myosin, (iii) saturating concentrations of actin appear to totally inhibit the arterial myosin ATPase activity, but only partially inhibit skeletal myosin activity, (iv) the free actin concentration required for half-maximal inhibition was significantly lower for the arterial myosin ATPase activity than for the skeletal myosin activity; (v) unlike skeletal actomyosin, arterial actomyosin exhibits tight binding characteristics in the presence of ATP, (vi) the binding stoichiometry for arterial myosin to skeletal F-actin was 2 mol of actin monomer/mol of myosin.

The kinetics of Ca2+ release and binding for both purified preparations could be described by a single exponential as has been observed for sarcoplasmic reticulum. The rate and extent of the fluorescence change for the solubilized and membrane-associated preparations are shown to be quite similar to those of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. From these results, it is concluded that all of the Ca2+-induced fluoescence change in sarcoplasmic reticulum originates from the Ca2+-ATPase. In addition, since the change in fluorescence is probably result of a conformational change in the ATPase during the Ca2+ pumping cycle, the results provide additional evidence that monomeric Ca2+-ATPase may be capable of Ca2+ transport since the delipidated preparation is monomeric under the conditions used for these experiments.

Transcription of lambda DNA at various salt concentrations was studied by three experimental methods: electrophoresis of the transcripts in polyacrylamide gels; hybridization of RNA to DNA restriction fragments transferred to nitrocellulose paper; and digestion of the transcripts with RNase T1 and analysis of the resulting 5'-end 32P-labeled oligonucleotides by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Transcription from promoters pL, pR, and p'R was maximal between 50 mM and 150 mM NaCl and diminished as the salt concentration was raised to 200 mM. RNA synthesis originating from p'R was predominant at all salt concentrations. The relative salt sensitivity of RNA synthesis was determined for these promoters and found to decrease in the order: pL > pR > p'R."
https://openalex.org/W2463976700,"When 125I-labeled H6 was incubated with trout testis nuclei under conditions of pH and ionic strength approximating those in vivo, the radioactivity bound nearly quantitatively to the chromatin. Under comparable conditions, most non-nuclear proteins do not bind. Binding was neither tissue- nor species-specific, and HMG-17, a mammalian homolog of H6, behaved similarly to H6. The labeled and the endogenous H6 molecules were equivalent by several criteria: 1) Both were released nearly quantitatively upon treatment of the chromatin with DNase I, whereas neither was released by digestion with micrococcal nuclease, suggesting that the labeled molecules, like those of endogenous H6, were bound primarily to the core particles in transcriptionally competent portions of the genome. 2) Salt extraction curves were similar for both the labeled and unlabeled proteins, although about 15% of the labeled molecules were bound to the chromatin more loosely than those of the endogenous H6. Taken together, these results suggest that chromatin contains specific, well defined sites to which H6 binds. Upon increasing the concentration of H6 in the incubation mixture, progressively greater numbers of low affinity, presumably nonspecific binding sites become occupied. This observation has important implications for studies in which nucleases are employed to probe chromatin structure, since they suggest that H6 molecules released from specific, high affinity sites by the action of the nuclease might rebind more loosely to other regions of the chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W1572787914,The methylation of newly synthesized ribosomal protein L11 has been obtained in an in vitro system using lambda rifd 18 DNA as template and S-adenosyl[3H]methionine as methyl donor. About four methyl groups are incorporated per mol of L11 synthesized and the bulk of the methyl groups are present in the protein as trimethyl-lysine. lambda rifd 18 DNA also contains the genes for rRNA and newly synthesized 16 S and 23 S RNA are also methylated in this in vitro system.

https://openalex.org/W1544744793,"The translational diffusion coefficient (D) of H-meromyosin in actin (F-actin) and ATP solution was measured under conditions wherein the actin-activated ATPase activity is close to its maximal value at a very low electrolyte concentration. The results were compared with similar data obtained with 0.1 M KCl, where H-meromyosin and actin were almost completely dissociated. With 0.1 M KCl, it was found that there was no dependence of the D of H-meromyosin on actin concentration. On the other hand, at a very low electrolyte concentration, it was found that the D of H-meromyosin did depend on actin concentration; at a rather high actin concentration (and activation of ATPase), it was slightly larger than at low or zero actin concentrations. This behavior of D at a low electrolyte concentration is interpreted on the assumption that even in solution, H-meromyosin molecules can actively slide on actin filaments due to the ATPase activity."
