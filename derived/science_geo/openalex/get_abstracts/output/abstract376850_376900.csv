https://openalex.org/W2058182560,"Huntington disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of more than 35–40 polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats in the huntingtin (htt) protein, resulting in accumulation of inclusion bodies containing fibrillar deposits of mutant htt fragments. Intriguingly, polyQ length is directly proportional to the propensity for htt to form fibrils and the severity of HD and is inversely correlated with age of onset. Although the structural basis for htt toxicity is unclear, the formation, abundance, and/or persistence of toxic conformers mediating neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in HD must also depend on polyQ length. Here we used atomic force microscopy to demonstrate mutant htt fragments and synthetic polyQ peptides form oligomers in a polyQ length-dependent manner. By time-lapse atomic force microscopy, oligomers form before fibrils, are transient in nature, and are occasionally direct precursors to fibrils. However, the vast majority of fibrils appear to form by monomer addition coinciding with the disappearance of oligomers. Thus, oligomers must undergo a major structural transition preceding fibril formation. In an immortalized striatal cell line and in brain homogenates from a mouse model of HD, a mutant htt fragment formed oligomers in a polyQ length-dependent manner that were similar in size to those formed in vitro, although these structures accumulated over time in vivo. Finally, using immunoelectron microscopy, we detected oligomeric-like structures in human HD brains. These results demonstrate that oligomer formation by a mutant htt fragment is strongly polyQ length-dependent in vitro and in vivo, consistent with a causative role for these structures, or subsets of these structures, in HD pathogenesis.

This expanded polyQ domain mediates the deposition of cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusion bodies that contain fibrillar material as determined by electron microscopy of HD brain tissues (2DiFiglia M.

PolyQ expansions are also responsible for a growing number of less common neurodegenerative disorders, such as the spinocerebellar ataxias (3Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). One of the most fascinating aspects of polyQ diseases is that the age of onset and severity of disease are tightly correlated with the length of the polyQ expansion. For example, HD repeat lengths of fewer than 35 do not result in disease, 35–39 repeats may or may not cause disease, 40–60 repeats elicits adult onset HD, and more than 60 repeats results in juvenile forms of HD (4Penney Jr., J.B.

Biochemical analyses of purified mutant htt fragments with polyQ repeats longer than 39Q demonstrated the polyQ length-dependent formation of detergent-insoluble protein aggregates characteristic of amyloid fibrils (7Scherzinger E.

Synthetic polyQ peptides with expanded polyQ repeats also form amyloid-like fibrils, but surprisingly, in contrast to studies with htt exon 1, synthetic peptides with non-disease-causing polyQ lengths readily aggregated into fibrils (9Chen S. Berthelier V. Hamilton J.B. O'Nuallain B. Wetzel R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7391-7399Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In cell culture, mutant htt fragments form intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in a polyQ length-dependent manner (10Lunkes A. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus, polyQ length directly correlates with the kinetics of aggregation into fibrils and formation of inclusion bodies. Mutant htt fragments and other expanded polyQ proteins, as demonstrated with transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), also assemble into spherical and annular oligomeric structures similar in size and morphology to those formed by Aβ, α-synuclein, and other proteins that have been implicated in neurodegeneration (13Poirier M.A. Li H.

Biol. 2004; 11: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, whether or not such structures form in a polyQ length-dependent manner has not been rigorously established. Although inclusion bodies are a major neuropathological hallmark of HD (3Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar), whether or not intraneuronal aggregates mediate HD pathogenesis is still not resolved. Considering the direct correlation between mutant htt aggregation and severity of pathogenesis with polyQ length (7Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), aggregation was thought to be causative in neurodegeneration. However, how the misfolded/aggregated form(s) mediates pathogenesis is unclear. Although, the onset of symptoms trails inclusion body formation in a transgenic mouse model of HD (16Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar), it might also be a conserved cellular mechanism to protect against diffuse, soluble, toxic forms of mutant htt (11Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 17Muchowski P.J. Ning K. D'Souza-Schorey C. Fields S. Proc. Natl.

Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). Indeed, such soluble aggregates that precede symptoms may exist (19Weiss A. Klein C. Woodman B. Sathasivam K. Bibel M. Régulier E. Bates G.P. Paganetti P. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 846-858PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis, a stable, toxic, monomeric β-sheet conformation of a thioredoxin-polyQ fusion protein was recently reported (20Nagai Y. Inui T. Popiel H.A. Fujikake N. Hasegawa K. Urade Y. Goto Y. Naiki H. Toda T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), suggesting that polyQ adopts multiple, distinct conformations that may have toxic consequences even in the absence of higher order aggregation. However, a mutant htt fragment may also misfold into distinct amyloid conformations and, depending on whether the polyQ domain was exposed or buried in a β-sheet, the amyloids can be either toxic or nontoxic, respectively (21Nekooki-Machida Y. Kurosawa M. Nukina N. Ito K. Oda T. Tanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9679-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Our recent studies used AFM and other techniques to show that an expanded polyQ domain in a mutant htt fragment adopts a stable multitude of monomeric (22Legleiter J. Lotz G.P. Miller J. Ko J. Ng C.

Chem. 2009; 284: 21647-21658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).4 Because polyQ length only above a critical threshold (35–40Q) causes HD and is correlated to the onset and severity of the disease, the formation, abundance, and/or persistence of toxic conformers that mediate neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in HD must also be polyQ length-dependent. Here, we sought to systematically quantify the effects of polyQ length on the kinetics, morphologies, and abundance of aggregates formed by a mutant htt fragment in comparison to those formed by synthetic peptides. Because traditional light and electron microscopic approaches have important limitations for studying heterogeneous mixtures of htt aggregates, we used AFM to characterize the morphology of the assembly states. AFM is uniquely well suited to study amyloidogenic proteins. It yields three-dimensional surface maps with nanometer resolution in solution in the absence of artifacts from sample processing. Our aim was to determine the precise relationship between aggregate morphology, kinetics of formation, and polyQ length. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HD fusion proteins were purified as described (24Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the GST moiety by a PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) initiates aggregation. Fresh, unfrozen GST-HD fusion protein was used for each experiment. Solutions with all fusion proteins were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove any preexisting aggregates before the addition of the PreScission protease. All peptides were custom synthesized and obtained from 21st Century Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA). The flanking lysines were included to ensure solubility. Disaggregation and solubilization of polyQ peptides were performed as described (25Chen S. Berthelier V. Yang W. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were dissolved in a 50:50 mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and hexafluoroisopropanol. After vortexing, the solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with agitation. The solvent was then evaporated off. The remaining peptide residue was resuspended in water adjusted to pH 3 with trifluoroacetic acid and to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. This was in turn diluted into Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl). For experiments on monomeric preparations of mutant htt proteins, GST-HD fusion proteins were incubated at 30 and 2 μm with 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) or at 60 μm without DTT in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl). PreScission protease (4 units of 100 μg of fusion protein) was added at time 0 to initiate GST cleavage and aggregation. Samples were incubated at 37 °C and 1400 rpm for the duration of the experiment. At 1, 3, 5, 8, and 24 h after cleavage of the GST, a sample (5 μl) of each incubation solution was deposited on freshly cleaved mica (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) and allowed to sit for 30 s. Then the substrate was washed with 200 μl of ultrapure water and dried under a gentle steam of air. For experiments on preformed fibrils, 40 μm solutions of HD53Q were incubated without DTT for 5–6 h after the removal of the GST tag to allow the formation of fibrils. Each sample was imaged ex situ using a MFP3D scanning probe microscope (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA). Images were taken with silicon cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 40 newtons/m and resonance frequency of ∼ 300 kHz. Typical imaging parameters were drive amplitude, 150–500 kHz with set points of 0.7–0.8 V, scan frequencies of 2–4 Hz, image resolution 512 by 512 points, and scan size of 5 μm. All experiments were performed in triplicate. For in situ AFM experiments tracking aggregation of monomeric preparations of HD53Q or synthetic peptide, bare substrate was imaged in buffer A, and the sample was injected directly into the fluid cell to reach the final concentration for the experiment. For in situ AFM experiments of preformed HD53Q fibrils, solutions containing preformed fibrils of HD53Q were allowed to rest on mica until several fibrils were present on the surface. Then the substrate was washed with buffer A to remove proteins remaining in solution, and then fresh monomeric preparations of HD53Q that had been incubated with protease on ice for 1 h was injected directly into the fluid cell. All in situ AFM images were taken with V-shaped oxide-sharpened silicon nitride cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 0.5 newtons/m. Scan rates were set at 1–2 Hz with cantilever drive frequencies ranging from ∼8 to 12 kHz. Images were taken with an image resolution of 1024 by 1024 points with scan sizes ranging from 10 to 20 μm. Image analysis of all AFM images was performed with Matlab with the image processing toolbox (Mathworks, Natick, MA) (for more details, see the supplemental material). Volume measurements were partially corrected for error associated with the finite size of the AFM probe based on geometric models (26Legleiter J. DeMattos R.B. Holtzman D.M. Kowalewski T. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2004; 278: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The analysis of mutant htt fragments by SDS-AGE with Western analysis was performed as described (19Weiss A. Klein C. Woodman B. Sathasivam K. Bibel M. Régulier E. Bates G.P. Paganetti P. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 846-858PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant htt oligomers were resolved by immunoreactions with the EM48 antibody (Chemicon, MAB5374). HD20Q and HD53Q proteins were purified as described (15Wacker J.L. Zareie M.H. Fong H. Sarikaya M. Muchowski P.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 24Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Fresh, unfrozen HD53Q and HD20Q proteins were used for all experiments. Before each experiment, HD20Q or HD53Q was centrifuged (20,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C to remove pre-existing aggregates. HD20Q or HD53Q were incubated at 12 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT at 37 °C with shaking at 800 rpm. Solutions of PreScission Protease (4 units/100 μg of fusion protein, Amersham Biosciences) were added at time 0 to initiate the aggregation of HD53Q. At the indicated time points after GST cleavage, equal amounts of protein (15 μg) were removed from the 12 μm aggregation reactions, diluted 1:1 into non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 33% glycerol, 1.2% SDS, and bromphenol blue), and analyzed by SDS-AGE and Western analysis with EM48 (1:1000). Molecular mass standards used in SDS-AGE were ferritin (400 kDa), thyroglobulin (660 kDa), and IgM (1000 kDa). Complete Httex1p plasmids encoding either a normal range (25Q), intermediate (46Q), or expanded (97Q) polyQ tract with alternating CAG/CAA amino acid repeats were fused in-frame to GFP at the C terminus and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as described (27Steffan J.S. Agrawal N. Pallos J. Rockabrand E. Trotman L.C. Slepko N. Illes K. Lukacsovich T. Zhu Y.Z. Cattaneo E. Pandolfi P.P. Thompson L.M. Marsh J.L.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 11404-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by sequencing and transient transfection into ST14A cells to observe expression using light microscopy (Zeiss AxioObserver.Z1). Immortalized rat striatal neurons (ST14A cells) were grown in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with Httex1p plasmids (1 μg) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). ST14A cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum at 33 °C (all reagents from Invitrogen). Each plasmid was transfected in duplicate per experiment, and three independent experiments were performed. At 24 and 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (from a concentrated stock at pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS) containing Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). A DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) was performed to determine protein concentration. Lysate (30 μg) was added in a 1:1 ratio to loading buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 33% glycerol, 1.2% SDS) and loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing 0.1% SDS and run until the dye front had migrated at least 12 cm to allow for maximum resolution of aggregates from the dye front. The proteins were then semidry-blotted (Owl HEP-1) onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in transfer buffer (192 mm glycine, 2 5 mm Tris-base, 0.1% SDS, 15% MeOH). This blot was blocked for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature. The blot was then probed with either EM48 (Millipore, 1:1000) or anti-GFP antibody (Clontech, 1:1000). Peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used at 1:50,000 for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were detected using PICO detection reagent (Pierce). The same lysates used in the SDS-AGE assays were analyzed by cellulose acetate filter-retardation assays. Lysate (30 μg) was diluted to 200 μl with 2% SDS and filtered through cellulose acetate membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, 0.2-μm pore size) with a Bio-Rad dot blot filtration unit. The assay was performed as described (7Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). The blot was then probed with primary and secondary antibodies and developed as described above. At 4, 7, and 14 weeks of age R6/2 and wild type cortex were homogenized with 10 volumes of ice-cold sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture) by a ball-bearing homogenizer and sonification with 10 pulses/min and 15% power. Samples were either analyzed without centrifugation (total homogenates) or were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C and were then diluted 1:1 into non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 33% glycerol, 1.2% SDS, and bromphenol blue). Bradford assays were used to determine protein concentration in the homogenates before the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Total protein (50 μg) was loaded per SDS-AGE well. Mutant htt oligomers were imaged after immunoreaction with EM48 antibody as described above. Immunoelectron microscopy (EM) analysis of human HD cortex and MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with FH969–100Q were performed as described (2DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Specifically, the cortex was dissected from a HD postmortem brain and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight, immersed in 20–30% sucrose for 1 to 2 days, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −70 °C. The number of CAG repeats identified in the HD allele was 69. Immunoperoxidase labeling was performed by cutting frozen sections (40 μm thick), incubated in 5% normal goat serum (NGS), 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with a primary antibody specific to htt1–17 at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in 5% NGS and 1% bovine serum albumin for 40 h at 4 °C. Control experiments included omission of the primary antibody and preadsorption with 50 μg of N-terminal peptide. Both of these controls resulted in the absence of staining. For analysis of ultrastructure, some immunoperoxidase-labeled sections were embedded in Epon, and thin sections were cut on an ultramicrotome and mounted on Formvar-coated slot grids. MCF-7 cells were cultured onto poly-l-lysine-coated microslips and transfected with FH969–100. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline 3 days after transfection. Cells were incubated with antibody M5 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. The htt bodies were visualized with diaminobenzidine. Cells were postfixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, incubated in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in increasing grades of alcohol, and embedded in an ethanol-soluble resin (LX112, LADD). Embedded cells were sectioned (Ultracut E; Reichert-Jung). Both cortex and MCF-7 cells were examined with a JEOL 100CX electron microscope. In these experiments we used mutant htt fragments with various polyQ repeat lengths (HD20Q, HD35Q, HD46Q, and HD53Q) that were purified from Escherichia coli as a fusion to GST (Fig. 1A) (24Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). After purification and centrifugation to remove small aggregates that might serve as seeds, GST-HD fusion proteins appeared to be non-aggregated by AFM (data not shown). Cleavage of the GST moiety with a site-specific protease (PreScission protease) released the intact mutant htt fragments, initiating aggregation in a time-dependent manner as reported (8Scherzinger E. Sittler A. Schweiger K. Heiser V. Lurz R. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 15Wacker J.L.

To determine the effects of polyQ length on the kinetics and morphologies of aggregates formed by a mutant htt fragment, preparations of soluble HD20Q, HD35Q, HD46Q, or HD53Q were incubated at concentrations of 2 and 30 μm and sampled for ex situ AFM analysis at 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 24 h after the addition of protease (Fig. 2). To quantify the relationship between oligomers, fibrils, and amorphous aggregates, the number of each aggregate type per μm2 was measured as a function of time at both concentrations (Fig. 3). Oligomers were defined as 2–10 nm in height with an aspect ratio (longest distance across to shortest distance across) less than 2.5, indicating a globular structure. Fibrils were defined as aggregates greater than 4 nm in height that had an aspect ratio greater than 2.5. Amorphous aggregates were defined as any aggregate greater than 10 nm in height that did not have any obvious fibrillar morphology. These criteria were based on measured characteristics of representative examples of each respective aggregate type (Fig. 1, C–E). The number of fibrils in a bundle was estimated by counting the number of fibrils visible in the bundle.FIGURE 3Aggregate species of mutant htt fragments change temporally in a polyQ length- and concentration-dependent manner. Quantification of aggregate types observed in AFM images for incubations HD20Q, HD35Q, HD46Q, and HD53Q at 2 μm and 30 μm. The numbers of oligomers (A), fibrils (B), and amorphous (C) aggregates per μm2 were calculated for all images in Fig. 2. The appearance of fibrils occurred earlier for longer polyQ repeat lengths. Although HD20Q formed oligomers at both concentrations, fibrils were not observed. For HD35Q, a peak population of oligomers preceded the formation of amorphous aggregates (2 μm) or fibrils (30 μm). A peak population of oligomers also preceded the appearance of fibrils of HD46Q at both concentrations. As fibrils of HD53Q appeared early in the experiment, a peak oligomer population preceding the appearance of fibrils was only observed if the kinetics of aggregation reactions were decreased (see supplemental Fig. 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oligomeric aggregates were observed for all htt fragments studied, including HD20Q.

Quantification of distinct aggregate types per unit area (Fig. 3) demonstrated that aggregation results in a complex mixture of aggregate types at any given time for mutant htt fragments. Oligomers were detected at both concentrations of HD20Q but gradually dissipated (2 μm) or remained relatively stable (30 μm) in number, depending on concentration. Importantly, fibrils were not observed for HD20Q at any time, unlike those observed with longer polyQ lengths (see below). For both concentrations of HD20Q, low amounts (< 0.3 aggregates/μm2) of amorphous aggregates were observed relative to other aggregate types. For HD35Q, a significant number of large amorphous aggregates (>1.0 aggregates/μm2) and very few (<0.1 fibrils/μm2) short putative fibrils formed at 2 μm after 8–24 h of incubation (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Short fibrillar species became the predominant aggregate type for HD35Q incubated at 30 μm after 8 h. The appea"

Subsequent condensation and bending of FtsZ filaments are important for the formation and constriction of the cytokinetic ring. PC190723 is an effective bactericidal cell division inhibitor that targets FtsZ in the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis and does not affect Escherichia coli cells, which apparently binds to a zone equivalent to the binding site of the antitumor drug taxol in tubulin (Haydon, D. J., Stokes, N. R., Ure, R., Galbraith, G., Bennett, J. M., Brown, D. R., Baker, P. J., Barynin, V. V., Rice, D. W., Sedelnikova, S. E., Heal, J. R., Sheridan, J. M., Aiwale, S. T., Chauhan, P. K., Srivastava, A., Taneja, A., Collins, I., Errington, J., and Czaplewski, L. G. (2008) Science 312, 1673–1675). We have found that the benzamide derivative PC190723 is an FtsZ polymer-stabilizing agent. PC190723 induced nucleated assembly of Bs-FtsZ into single-stranded coiled protofilaments and polymorphic condensates, including bundles, coils, and toroids, whose formation could be modulated with different solution conditions. Under conditions for reversible assembly of Bs-FtsZ, PC190723 binding reduced the GTPase activity and induced the formation of straight bundles and ribbons, which was also observed with Sa-FtsZ but not with nonsusceptible Ec-FtsZ. The fragment 2,6-difluoro-3-methoxybenzamide also induced Bs-FtsZ bundling. We propose that polymer stabilization by PC190723 suppresses in vivo FtsZ polymer dynamics and bacterial division. The biochemical action of PC190723 on FtsZ parallels that of the microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol on the eukaryotic structural homologue tubulin. Both taxol and PC190723 stabilize polymers against disassembly by preferential binding to each assembled protein.

Essential cell division protein FtsZ assembles into filaments that form the cytokinetic ring at the division site (1Bi E.F. Lutkenhaus J. Nature. 1991; 354: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar) and recruits the accessory proteins of the bacterial divisome (2Margolin W. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). FtsZ, with an added membrane anchor, can form constricting rings in liposomes (5Osawa M. Anderson D.E. Erickson H.P. Science. 2008; 320: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). FtsZ is a member of the tubulin family of cytoskeletal GTPases, also including αβ-tubulin, γ-tubulin, bacterial tubulin BtubA/B (3Michie K.A. Löwe J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 467-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 6Buey R.M. Díaz J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5933-5938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and divergent TubZs (7Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1340-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). FtsZ and tubulin use the same structural fold and similar head-to-tail protofilaments with GTP bound at the intersubunit association interface (8Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), yet they have evolved to form different assemblies with specialized functions. Their GTPase sites are completed upon contact of the apical GTP-binding domain of one subunit with the basal GTPase activation domain of the next subunit. GTP hydrolysis renders the polymers metastable and ready for disassembly. There is evidence that unassembled tubulin, unlike other GTPases, is predominantly in an inactive (curved) conformation regardless of which nucleotide is bound and switches into the active (straight) conformation mainly through the assembly contacts and that GTP binding lowers the free energy barrier between both conformations (6Buey R.M.

Binding of the successful antitumor drug taxol overrides the GTP/GDP regulation, inducing microtubule assembly even with GDP (12Díaz J.F. Menéndez M. Andreu J.M.

Biol. 2007; 17: 1765-1770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Tubulin promiscuously interacts with small molecules of natural origin that induce or inhibit its assembly. However, there are fewer functional inhibitors for FtsZ. FtsZ is a relatively simple assembly machine capable of nucleated linear polymerization. Such cooperative behavior of a linear polymer was anticipated by the self-switching assembly concept (14Caspar D.L. Biophys. J. 1980; 32: 103-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and suggested to be possible for FtsZ if dimerization caused a conformational change that increases the affinity of the next monomer to bind (3Michie K.A. Löwe J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 467-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Dajkovic A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 11: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cryoelectron microscopy of unsupported samples has shown that FtsZ from Escherichia coli can form semiflexible single-stranded filaments (16Huecas S. Llorca O. Boskovic J. Martín-Benito J. Valpuesta J.M. Andreu J.M. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 1796-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Their cooperative behavior is explained by an unfavorable monomer isomerization (activation switch) between an inactive, assembly incompetent, and active conformation, which is coupled to assembly, creating a nucleation barrier (16Huecas S.

On the other hand, FtsZ from Methanococcus jannaschii forms characteristic double-stranded filaments (20Löwe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 21Oliva M.A. Huecas S. Palacios J.M. Martín-Benito J. Valpuesta J.M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33562-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A number of crystal structures of FtsZ did not reveal a nucleotide-induced activation switch (22Oliva M.A. Trambaiolo D. Löwe J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 1229-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The structural flexibility changes coupled to assembly are unknown, requiring determination of an FtsZ filament structure. A cryoelectron tomography study of the Caulobacter crescentus cytoskeleton revealed a putative FtsZ ring, consisting of a few short (100 nm) apparently single-stranded FtsZ filaments (5-nm wide) below the plasma membrane near the division site, and suggested that these FtsZ polymers generate the force that constricts the membrane for division through iterative cycles of GTP hydrolysis, depolymerization, and repolymerization (23Li Z. Trimble M.J. Brun Y.V. Jensen G.J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4694-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Lateral FtsZ filament association is also important for Z-ring formation and constriction. Several proteins are known to bundle FtsZ filaments, including ZipA, ZapA, and SepF (4Adams D.W. Errington J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Helical FtsZ structures remodel by lateral association into the Z-ring in Bacillus subtilis (24Monahan L.G. Robinson A. Harry E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 74: 1004-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and artificial FtsZ rings coalesce into brighter rings (5Osawa M. Anderson D.E. Erickson H.P. Science. 2008; 320: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Several theoretical models for the Z-ring have proposed different roles for FtsZ filament condensation and bending (reviewed in Ref. 25Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). FtsZ filaments are dynamic, with a subunit half-life of ∼10 s, depending on the GTPase rate (26Stricker J. Maddox P. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3171-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although FtsZ polymers can exchange nucleotides, GDP dissociation may be slow enough for polymer disassembly to take place first, resulting in the subunits of FtsZ polymers recycling with GTP hydrolysis (27Huecas S. Schaffner-Barbero C. García W. Yébenes H. Palacios J.M. Díaz J.F. Menéndez M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37515-37528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Chen Y. Erickson H.P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6664-6673Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The length dynamics of the small individual FtsZ filaments have not been determined. Impairing FtsZ filament dynamics should block bacterial division. FtsZ has been recognized as an attractive target for new antibiotics (29Vollmer W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 73: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) for emerging resistant pathogens. Expression of ftsZ is more stringently required for bacterial growth than the established antibacterial targets murA and fabl (30Goh S. Boberek J.M. Nakashima N. Stach J. Good L. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Potentially druggable cavities in FtsZ structures (22Oliva M.A. Trambaiolo D. Löwe J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 1229-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) are the apical nucleotide-binding site and a lateral channel between the N- and C-terminal domains. The latter overlaps the binding site of the microtubule-stabilizing antitumor drug taxol in eukaryotic tubulin. Several GTP analogues substituted at C-8 selectively inhibit FtsZ polymerization but support tubulin assembly into microtubules (31Läppchen T. Pinas V.A. Hartog A.F. Koomen G.J. Schaffner-Barbero C. Andreu J.M. Trambaiolo D. Löwe J. Juhem A. Popov A.V. den Blaauwen T. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), indicating differences in nucleotide binding by each protein that may be exploited to selectively inhibit bacterial FtsZ without poisoning eukaryotic tubulin. FtsZ recently has been validated as the target of an effective antibacterial compound developed as a cell division inhibitor in B. subtilis and the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, PC190723. Its putative binding site, mapped with resistance mutations, corresponds to the taxol-binding site in tubulin (32Haydon D.J. Stokes N.R. Ure R. Galbraith G. Bennett J.M. Brown D.R. Baker P.J. Barynin V.V. Rice D.W. Sedelnikova S.E. Heal J.R. Sheridan J.M. Aiwale S.T. Chauhan P.K. Srivastava A. Taneja A. Collins I. Errington J. Czaplewski L.G. Science. 2008; 321: 1673-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We aimed to determine the mechanism of functional inhibition of FtsZ by the small antibacterial molecule PC190723, 3-[(6-chloro[1,3]thiazolo[5,4-b]pyridin-2-yl)methoxy]-2,6-difluorobenzamide (abbreviated here as PC). 3The abbreviations used are: PC3-[(6-chloro[1,3]thiazolo[5,4-b]pyridin-2-yl)methoxy]-2,6-difluorobenzamideMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidDFMBA2,6-difluoro-3-methoxybenzamideCTPM(6-chloro[1,3]thiazolo[5.4-b] prydin-2-yl)methanolBs-FtsZFtsZ from B. subtilisSa-FtsZFtsZ from S. aureusEc-FtsZFtsZ from Escherichia coliCrcritical protein concentration for polymerizationHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyGMPCPPguanosine-5′-[(2,β)-methylene]triphosphate. We have found that PC enhances the cooperative assembly of Bs-FtsZ into filaments, bundles, and other condensates. PC also is a Sa-FtsZ polymer stabilizer. Stabilizing FtsZ polymers should reduce their dynamics, which explains why PC blocks cell division in bacteria analogously to the action of taxol on tubulin. 3-[(6-chloro[1,3]thiazolo[5,4-b]pyridin-2-yl)methoxy]-2,6-difluorobenzamide 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 2,6-difluoro-3-methoxybenzamide (6-chloro[1,3]thiazolo[5.4-b] prydin-2-yl)methanol FtsZ from B. subtilis FtsZ from S. aureus FtsZ from Escherichia coli critical protein concentration for polymerization high pressure liquid chromatography guanosine-5′-[(2,β)-methylene]triphosphate. Methods for Bs-FtsZ, Ec-FtsZ, Sa-FtsZ, and tubulin purification, monitoring assembly with light scattering, electron microscopy, polymer pelleting, binding measurements, GTPase, and a screen of solution conditions for assembly are described under the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” PC190723 was provided by Prolysis (32Haydon D.J. Stokes N.R. Ure R. Galbraith G. Bennett J.M. Brown D.R. Baker P.J. Barynin V.V. Rice D.W. Sedelnikova S.E. Heal J.R. Sheridan J.M. Aiwale S.T. Chauhan P.K. Srivastava A. Taneja A. Collins I. Errington J. Czaplewski L.G. Science. 2008; 321: 1673-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Stock solutions (1 mm) in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (Merck Uvasol) were kept frozen and dry. They were diluted directly into the experimental samples. Residual dimethyl sulfoxide was 2% (v/v) unless indicated. DFMBA, 2,6-difluoro-3-hydroxybenzamide, and CTPM were synthesized in this work (supplemental data). Buffers employed were as follows: Hepes50 (50 mm Hepes/KOH, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8), Hepes250 (50 mm Hepes/KOH, 250 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8) (where indicated, these buffers were made at pH 7.5), and Mes50 (50 mm Mes/KOH, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5). PC190723 induced Bs-FtsZ assembly into bundles and isolated filaments. These processes could be dissected and analyzed, employing different solution conditions, as described below. To characterize the effects of PC on FtsZ assembly, full-length, untagged FtsZ from B. subtilis was first expressed and purified, and its reversible assembly was induced by 10 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm GTP in Hepes50, 25 °C (see “Experimental Procedures”) without other additives, which were chosen for convenience as reference conditions. Addition of PC induced a dramatic increase in FtsZ light scattering and stabilized polymers against disassembly induced by GDP (Fig. 1A). Many large PC-induced bundles and ribbons, in addition to FtsZ filaments, were observed by negative stain electron microscopy (Fig. 1B). These bundles and ribbons were several microns long, had a variable ∼30 to ∼60 nm width, and were apparently made of associated FtsZ filaments. Computed diffraction patterns indicated an axial spacing of 4.5 ± 0.5 nm between subunits (Fig. 1, C and D), which is compatible with the 4.3-nm spacing of FtsZ monomers associated head-to-tail in tubulin-like protofilaments (20Löwe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 21Oliva M.A. Huecas S. Palacios J.M. Martín-Benito J. Valpuesta J.M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33562-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and a shorter lateral spacing of 3.8 ± 0.3 nm, suggesting a lateral association of Bs-FtsZ molecules (Protein Data Bank code 2VXY; 32Haydon D.J. Stokes N.R. Ure R. Galbraith G. Bennett J.M. Brown D.R. Baker P.J. Barynin V.V. Rice D.W. Sedelnikova S.E. Heal J.R. Sheridan J.M. Aiwale S.T. Chauhan P.K. Srivastava A. Taneja A. Collins I. Errington J. Czaplewski L.G. Science. 2008; 321: 1673-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) in contact along their shortest dimension (that is, rotated ∼90° on the longitudinal axis with respect to tubulin protofilaments in a microtubule) (33Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). PC-induced bundles and ribbons also formed with the slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue GMPCPP (0.1 mm). Most FtsZ above a small ∼0.3 μm critical concentration (Cr) pelleted upon 20 min of centrifugation at 386,000 × g (Fig. 1E). In the absence of PC, relatively short, ∼4-nm wide filaments were observed (Fig. 1F), which sedimented above a larger Cr ∼5 μm FtsZ. These results indicated that the small molecule PC stabilized Bs-FtsZ filament bundles but did not distinguish whether PC primarily enhances filament formation or bundling. To elucidate the mechanism of PC-induced assembly and to characterize the effects of PC under more physiological conditions, pH was increased to 7.5, or ionic strength increased to 250 mm KCl, which reduced the extent of spontaneous Bs-FtsZ assembly with nucleotide and Mg2+. Assembly was efficiently induced by PC in these cases (Fig. 1E), although bundle formation was reduced. Assembly was markedly sensitive to the buffer anion (supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). Disassembly could be monitored by light scattering following assembly of 10 μm Bs-FtsZ with 25 μm GMPCPP (expected to stabilize polymers) and 10 mm MgCl2 in 250 mm KCl (scattering with GTP was very small). This was attributed to GMPCPP hydrolysis and was not observed in the presence of PC. GTP or GMPCPP was required for PC-enhanced assembly. Mg2+ without nucleotide was ineffective. Interestingly, GTP or GMPCPP without Mg2+ induced assembly of Bs-FtsZ filaments, which were not formed with GDP or GMPCP. Mg2+ plus GDP or GMPCP and PC gave a weak polymer formation. These results confirmed that PC stabilizes Bs-FtsZ polymers and showed the requirement of the nucleotide γ-phosphate. It was possible to separate PC-induced filament assembly from bundle formation by using 250 mm KCl and GMPCPP. Bs-FtsZ assembly was only incipient without Mg2+ (Fig. 2A). Adding only PC induced characteristic filament coils (Fig. 2B), whereas Mg2+ alone induced the formation of filaments (Fig. 2C). Both were inhibited with GMPCP. PC and Mg2+ together induced the formation of filaments and bundles (Fig. 2D). Similar results were obtained with GTP, but with PC and Mg2+, dense coils and no bundles were observed (supplemental Fig. S1). Mg2+-less Hepes250 buffer permitted PC-induced nucleated assembly of single-stranded Bs-FtsZ filaments. Our divalent cation-free solutions typically contain ∼1 μm residual Mg2+ (34Rivas G. López A. Mingorance J. Ferrándiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) that with 1 mm EDTA in buffer results in ∼4 nm free Mg2+. Incipient assembly of Bs-FtsZ was observed with nucleotide in the absence of PC (no nucleotide-induced light scattering increase or pelleting). However, addition of PC under these conditions resulted in Bs-FtsZ polymerization. There was a small light scattering increase with PC and GMPCPP (Fig. 3A). These PC-induced FtsZ filaments sedimented in 80 min at 386,000 × g, which allowed their quantification. Practically all Bs-FtsZ was pelleted with PC and GTP or GMPCPP above a Cr ∼1 μm (Fig. 3B; GTP, 0.8 ± 0.1 μm; GMPCPP, 1.3 ± 0.3 μm). Insignificant GTP hydrolysis was detected under these conditions. These results indicated a nucleated polymerization mechanism for the PC-induced assembly of Bs-FtsZ filaments, with an apparent free energy change for polymer elongation ΔGapp0 = RTlnCr = −8.2 kcal mol−1 (16Huecas S. Llorca O. Boskovic J. Martín-Benito J. Valpuesta J.M. Andreu J.M. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 1796-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). With GTP or GMPCPP and no PC, a background similar to that of PC and GDP or GMPCP was observed (Fig. 3B). Cr decreased to insignificant values in experiments made in parallel with 10 mm MgCl2 (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating a larger effective elongation affinity, although the system was not at chemical equilibrium due to nucleotide hydrolysis. Interestingly, the PC-induced Bs-FtsZ filaments without Mg2+ typically had an ∼100-nm curvature radius and appeared single-stranded. To confirm that these filaments are single-stranded, we performed cryoelectron microscopy under these conditions, using holey carbon film. The sample trapped within the small holes was quickly vitrified and kept under liquid nitrogen temperatures to rule out any effect of the staining agent or the adsorption to a support film (Fig. 3C). Filament width measurements from the cryomicrographs had a distribution with an average 3.5 ± 0.7 nm (Fig. 3D), indicating that these filaments are one Bs-FtsZ molecule wide. Titrations of Bs-FtsZ polymer formation with PC showed an increasing fraction of sedimented FtsZ, which saturated between 0.5 and 1 PC per FtsZ (Fig. 4A), compatible with PC inducing polymerization by binding to one site in FtsZ. For a ligand to induce protein association, it has to bind more to the protein polymer than the monomer. As a first approach, PC binding to Bs-FtsZ polymers was determined by extraction of the ligand from the pellets and supernatants followed by HPLC. PC cosedimented with the polymers and inhibition of polymerization with GDP also inhibited the PC pulldown. The results were 0.5 PC bound per FtsZ at ∼10 μm free PC, irrespective of ionic strength and magnesium level (0.46 ± 0.14 in Hepes50 with 10 mm MgCl2, 0.40 ± 0.10 in Hepes250 without MgCl2, and 0.54 ± 0.10 in Hepes250 with 10 mm MgCl2). FtsZ was active in polymer formation (Fig. 3B), and saturating the binding to an expected 1 PC per FtsZ was precluded by the free ligand solubility (∼10 μm in our buffers). The simplest interpretation of these results is one PC binding site per polymer FtsZ molecule with an apparent affinity ∼105 m−1. Interestingly, the PC fragment DFMBA (1–4 mm; Fig. 5, A and C), 2,6-difluoro-3-hydroxybenzamide(1–4 mm) and to a lesser extent 3-methoxybenzamide (20 mm), were found to induce large Bs-FtsZ bundles similar to those obtained with PC (20 μm), thus following their relative antibacterial activities (35Czaplewski L.G. Collins I. Boyd E.A. Brown D. East S.P. Gardiner M. Fletcher R. Haydon D.J. Henstock V. Ingram P. Jones C. Noula C. Kennison L. Rockley C. Rose V. Thomaides-Brears H.B. Ure R. Whittaker M. Stokes N.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2009; 19: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The other fragment of the PC molecule, CTPM (1 mm) did not induce Bs-FtsZ bundling (Fig. 5, B and C). These results suggested specific but weak binding of DFMBA to Bs-FtsZ polymers, which could not be accurately measured by pelleting HPLC. DFMBA has an ∼102-fold higher effective concentration than PC, suggesting a two order of magnitude lower affinity. Note that if PC were a nonself-associating ideal bifunctional ligand (36Andreu J.M. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the rest of the molecule, if isolated, would be expected to bind more weakly than DFMBA and be inactive below ∼0.5 m. The effects of PC on the GTPase activity of polymerizing Bs-FtsZ solutions was examined with 10 mm MgCl2 in three buffers that give quite different degrees of PC-induced bundling (see above). Control GTPase without PC was dependent on the KCl concentration: 0.61 ± 0.09 min−1 in Hepes250, 0.22 ± 0.02 min−1 in Hepes50, 0.15 ± 0.08 min−1 in Mes50. A partial inhibition of the GTPase rate was observed with PC, to a similar extent (Fig. 6) irrespective of the buffer. The inhibition between ∼1 and ∼10 μm PC roughly paralleled the formation of pelletable polymer (Fig. 4A). Low PC concentrations variably enhanced the relative GTPase activity in Hepes250. This may be a simple consequence of a large increase in FtsZ GTPase upon polymerization relative to the weakly polymerizing control without PC (Fig. 1E) (since the rate measured is per total FtsZ, not per assembled FtsZ). Control measurements showed that 3H[GTP] binding to Bs-FtsZ and to Ec-FtsZ was not modified by PC (supplemental Fig. S3). Bs-FtsZ filaments frequently adopted bow shapes and easily coalesced into coils or associated into straight bundles (see above). Other Bs-FtsZ filament condensates also observed include toroids and helical bundles (see supplemental Table S1 for a list of polymorphs and conditions). Briefly, along with filaments formed with GTP and PC (Fig. 7A) and filament coils (similar to Fig. 2B), toroids ∼300 nm in diameter were observed on the same grids (Fig. 7B). Large helical bundles were observed at pH 7.5 with PC, GTP, and Mg2+ (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, Bs-FtsZ condensates could also form in the absence of PC with GMPCPP and Mg2+ as coils, and smaller toroids ∼150 nm in diameter were observed (Fig. 7D). We next compared the effects of PC on the assembly of FtsZ from susceptible (B. subtilis and S. aureus) and nonsusceptible (E. coli) bacteria in Hepes50 (Fig. 8A). The weak formation of pelletable polymer by Sa-FtsZ was markedly enhanced by PC, at concentrations higher than with Bs-FtsZ. A large PC-induced increase in Sa-FtsZ light scattering was observed with nucleotide and Mg2+ (supplemental Fig. S4). Electron micrographs showed a transformation of Sa-FtsZ oligomers (Fig. 8B) into coils, toroids, and straight bundles with PC (Fig. 8, C and D). DFMBA had similar effects at higher concentrations. On the other hand, PC induced bundling was not observed with Ec-FtsZ. Filament morphology was not modified (Fig. 8E), and changes in polymerization were insignificant when employing a GTP-regenerating system (Fig. 8A). Unexpectedly, PC induced a faster disassembly without a GTP regenerating system (supplemental Fig. S4C) and a 2-fold enhancement of Ec-FtsZ GTPase (Fig. 6). HPLC measurements (with 10 μm Ec-FtsZ and 20 μm PC) indicated binding of 0.4 PC per polymerized Ec-FtsZ, although it did not induce bundling. Finally, PC (20 μm) or DFMBA (4 mm) did not affect the assembly of the more distant eukaryotic homologue αβ-tubulin (15 μm) in light scattering tests, or the gross morphology (in electron microscopy) of the microtubular polymers formed (not shown). We have shown in this study that binding of the small antibacterial molecule PC190723 enhances the assembly of purified cell division protein Bs-FtsZ into filaments and bundles. Preventing disassembly of FtsZ polymers should inhibit their functional dynamics in vivo, which we propose explains cytokinesis inhibition. This is supported by the observation of FtsZ foci along PC-treated bacilli instead of Z-rings (32Haydon D.J. Stokes N.R. Ure R. Galbraith G. Bennett J.M. Brown D.R. Baker P.J. Barynin V.V. Rice D.W.

Our results also give insight into the mechanisms of FtsZ assembly and facilitate the use of PC as a tool to investigate the biological role of FtsZ. PC binding induces Bs-FtsZ filament formation under incipient assembly conditions (250 mm KCl, no Mg2+). These filaments are single stranded, yet they assemble with a cooperative critical concentration behavior, typical of multi-str"

Their number is modulated by learning, suggesting that they could play a role in plastic changes of the bulbar network associated with olfactory memory. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were trained in an associative olfactory task, and we analyzed long-term retention of the task 5, 30, and 90 d post-training. In parallel, we assessed the fate of these newborn cells, mapped their distribution in the olfactory bulb and measured their functional implication using the immediate early gene Zif268. In a second set of experiments, we pharmacologically modulated glutamatergic transmission and using the same behavioral task assessed the consequences on memory retention and neurogenesis. Finally, by local infusion of an antimitotic drug, we selectively blocked neurogenesis during acquisition of the task and looked at the effects on memory retention. First we demonstrated that retrieval of an associative olfactory task recruits the newborn neurons in odor-specific areas of the olfactory bulb selected to survive during acquisition of the task and that it does this in a manner that depends on the strength of learning. We then demonstrated that acquisition is not dependent on neurogenesis if long-term retention of the task is abolished by blocking neurogenesis. Adult-born neurons are thus involved in changes in the neural representation of an odor; this underlies long-term olfactory memory as the strength of learning is linked to the duration of this memory. Neurogenesis thus plays a crucial role in long-term olfactory memory.—Sultan, S., Mandairon, N., Kermen, F., Garcia, S., Sacquet, J., Didier, A.

A double mutant (F126A/W127A), designed to disrupt dimerization at the predicted CD1-CD1 dimer interface, predominantly converts Apo3G to a monomer that binds single-stranded DNA, Alu RNA, and catalyzes processive C→U deaminations with 3′→5′ deamination polarity, similar to native Apo3G. The CD1 domain is essential for both processivity and polarity. We propose a structure-based model to explain the scanning and catalytic behavior of Apo3G.

Following release from the HIV virion into T cells, Apo3G generates large numbers of deaminations, typically 5′-CCC→CCU, in viral (−) single-stranded cDNA during reverse transcription (16Yu Q.

It restricts retrotransposition by binding Alu RNA transcripts in the cytoplasm, thereby blocking the transposition cycle (19Chiu Y.L. Witkowska H.E. Hall S.C. Santiago M. Soros V.B. Esnault C.

In this study, we address the relationship of Apo3G structure to biochemical function. An Apo3G monomer has two homologous deaminase domains, an active C-terminal domain (CD2) required for catalysis and motif specificity and a catalytically inactive N-terminal domain (CD1) needed for DNA and RNA binding (20Haché G. Liddament M.T. Harris R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Navarro F. Bollman B. Chen H. König R. Yu Q. Chiles K. Landau N.R. Virology. 2005; 333: 374-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The CD1 domain is believed to be required for the incorporation of Apo3G into virions (21Navarro F. Bollman B. Chen H. König R. Yu Q. Chiles K. Landau N.R. Virology. 2005; 333: 374-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Apo3G deaminates ssDNA processively, with a strongly polar 3′→5′ deamination bias (22Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Therefore, the processive sliding and jumping/hopping motions must be random, yet the deaminations are decidedly non-random (22Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol.

The question is: “What is the biochemical/structural mechanism?” There was an overriding serious impediment in the way of addressing the mechanism because highly purified native Apo3G is composed of monomers, dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher order oligomers in the absence of DNA (23Chelico L.

Apo3G may be present as an oligomer bound to RNA when released from the HIV virion into a T cell (7Burnett A. Spearman P. J.

PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), but most, if not all, of the RNA must be degraded to activate Apo3G for catalysis (25Soros V.B. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C.

Does Apo3G work solely as a dimer, as is currently thought (24Salter J.D. Krucinska J. Raina J. Smith H.C. Wedekind J.E.

This mutant was designed to disrupt dimerization based on structures of APOBEC2 (Apo2) (28Prochnow C. Bransteitter R. Klein M.G. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S.

We analyze the ssDNA scanning and C-deamination properties of the monomer and the Apo3G-CD2 catalytic domain (in the absence of CD1) relative to those of the naturally occurring heterogeneous assortment of Apo3G monomers and oligomers (23Chelico L.

We propose a model to account for the processive and polar characteristics of Apo3G-catalyzed deamination on ssDNA based on biochemical comparisons of the native and Apo3G monomer, in conjunction with structural studies on Apo2 (28Prochnow C.

The predicted model of Apo3G CD1 was obtained by using the interactive SWISS-MODEL program using the homologous Apo2 (Protein Data Bank (PDB): 2nyt) structure as a template (see Fig. 1B). For the Apo3G dimer head-head configuration (see Fig. 1D), the Apo3G-CD1 model was aligned with each Apo2 monomer in the Apo2 tetrameric interface. For the Apo3G dimer tail-tail configuration (see Fig. 1E), the Apo3G-CD2 (PDB: 3e1u) structures were aligned with each Apo2 monomer in the tetrameric interface. All figures were made using PyMOL. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 3400 DNA/RNA synthesizer and are listed in supplemental Table S1. Fluorescein-dT was purchased from Glen Research. Fluorescently labeled RNA was produced by transcribing the DNA sequence, cloned into the pSP72 vector (Promega) using XhoI and HindIII sites, with SP6 RNA polymerase with a pool of nucleotides containing fluorescein-12-UTP (Roche Applied Science).

Apo3G (50–100 μg in 30 μl) was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using a silica-based column (8-nm diameter, 300-mm length, KW-803 Shodex). A solution containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.7, and 200 mm NaSO4 was used as the eluent buffer. Chromatography was performed at 0.5 ml min−1, and the column effluent was passed directly on-line into a MALS detector (Dawn Heleos, Wyatt Technology) and refractometer (Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technology). Data analysis to determine molecular masses was performed with ASTRA software. Experiments were conducted at the University of Southern California (USC) NanoBiophysics Core Facility. Apo3G imaging buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) and sample were prepared as described previously (23Chelico L. Sacho E.J. Erie D.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

For experiments done in the presence of DNA substrate, 400 nm (final concentration) of ssDNA substrate was added to the Apo3G sample (100 nm final concentration) before depositing as for the protein alone. All AFM images were captured in air using a Nanoscope IIIa (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) microscope in tapping mode. Experiments were conducted at the USC NanoBiophysics Core Facility. Pointprobe Plus tapping mode silicon probes (Agilent, Tempe, AZ) with resonance frequencies of ∼170 kHz were used for imaging. Images were collected at a speed of 2–3 Hz with an image size of 1 × 1 μm at 512 × 512-pixel resolution. Volume analysis was done as described previously (32Ratcliff G.C. Erie D.A. J. Am. Chem.

Apo3G activity on ssDNA substrates was measured in reactions containing 50 nm 32P-labeled DNA, 5 or 1000 nm Apo3G in buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated for 2.5–30 min at 37 °C. ssDNA substrates (0.5 μm) with an internal fluorescein label were incubated with Apo3G (15–1000 nm), and deaminations were carried out as described above. Reactions were terminated by an extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and deaminations were detected by the uracil DNA glycosylase assay, as described previously (22Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Gel band intensities were visualized by phosphorimaging or with an FX fluorescence scanner (Bio-Rad) and then measured with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Pre-steady state reactions were mechanically sampled and quenched using a KinTek quench-flow instrument as described previously (23Chelico L. Sacho E.J. Erie D.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13780-13791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Samples were then treated as described above. Apo3G-RNA or -DNA binding was monitored by changes in steady state fluorescence depolarization (rotational anisotropy). Reaction mixtures (70 μl), containing fluorescein-labeled RNA or DNA (50 nm) in buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and varying concentrations of 0–2400 nm Apo3G, were incubated at 37 °C. Rotational anisotropy was measured using a QuantaMaster QM-1 fluorometer (Photon Technology International) with a single emission channel. Samples were excited with vertically polarized light at 494 nm, and both vertical and horizontal emission was monitored at 520 nm (4 nm band pass). The fractions of RNA or DNA bound to protein were determined as described previously (34Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33047-33050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Reactions were at 21 °C in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Stopped-flow anisotropy measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics Π*180 spectrofluorometer equipped for anisotropy as described previously (23Chelico L. Sacho E.J. Erie D.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13780-13791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Apo3G exists as a combination of monomers, dimers, tetramers, and higher oligomeric forms (23Chelico L. Sacho E.J. Erie D.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13780-13791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Salter J.D. Krucinska J. Raina J. Smith H.C. Wedekind J.E.

Oligomerization appears to be essential for cellular functions such as virion incorporation (7Burnett A. Spearman P. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5000-5013Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Alu retrotransposon restriction (9Bach D. Peddi S. Mangeat B. Lakkaraju A. Strub K. Trono D. Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 54Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Huthoff H. Autore F. Gallois-Montbrun S. Fraternali F. Malim M.H. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000330Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); however, the molecular interactions responsible for forming the different oligomers are poorly defined. Our principal objectives are: to determine the scanning, substrate binding, and deamination properties of monomeric Apo3G; to compare the biochemical mechanisms of monomeric Apo3G with CD2 and with native Apo3G; and to determine the role of CD1 in the scanning mechanism. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the amino acids responsible for oligomerization and introduce strategic mutations that interfere with oligomer assembly and to verify the composition of Apo3G native and mutant forms. We performed comparative homology modeling and structure-guided mutagenesis, based on the previously determined crystal structures of the homologous Apo2 tetramer (28Prochnow C. Bransteitter R. Klein M.G. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2007; 445: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and the Apo3G CD2 domain (29Holden L.G. Prochnow C. Chang Y.P. Bransteitter R. Chelico L. Sen U. Stevens R.C. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2008; 456: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), to design Apo3G mutants that are predicted to disrupt oligomerization. The double-domain Apo3G monomer is equivalent to the single-domain Apo2 dimer. Furthermore, the dimerization interface of Apo3G is predicted to be equivalent to the Apo2 tetramer interface. Apo2 tetramer oligomerization occurs through a head-head (i.e. N-N) dimer that forms a hydrophobic dimer-dimer interface created by residues found on loop 7 of each dimer (28Prochnow C. Bransteitter R. Klein M.G. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2007; 445: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Through sequence alignment of Apo2, Apo3G CD1 domain (head), and Apo3G CD2 domain (tail), the loop 7 cluster of residues was used to identify homologous residues on the equivalent loop 7 of the Apo3G CD1 domain and Apo3G CD2 domain (supplemental Fig. S1). We mutated these residues to alanine to determine whether we could disrupt oligomerization at the CD1 domain (Y124A/Y125A; F126A/W127A; Fig. 1B) or CD2 domain (R313A/D316A/D317A/Q318A;I314A/Y315A; Fig. 1C). Apo3G dimerization could presumably occur in a head-head (CD1-CD1, Fig. 1D), tail-tail (CD2-CD2, Fig. 1E), or head-tail (CD1-CD2, not shown) orientation. The hydrophobic residues located on loop 7 of Apo2 are highly conserved in the Apo3G CD1 domain (Fig. 1, A and D, supplemental Fig. S1). This homology is in contrast to the Apo3G CD2 domain loop 72, which contains mainly charged residues that were previously shown to be involved in DNA binding and specificity (29Holden L.G. Prochnow C. Chang Y.P. Bransteitter R. Chelico L. Sen U. Stevens R.C. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2008; 456: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E, supplemental Fig. S1). Based on these observations, we predicted that Apo3G dimerization occurs in a CD1-CD1 head-head orientation (Fig. 1D). The oligomerization state of Apo3G in native and mutant forms was determined using MALS (Fig. 2). Purified protein is injected into a high pressure liquid chromatography size-exclusion column followed in series by detectors that measure UV absorbance, MALS, and refractive index (35Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The light-scattering chromatogram (Fig. 2A, Raleigh ratio, right y axis) in combination with the molecular mass line plot (Fig. 2A, left y axis) shows that native Apo3G (predicted molecular mass 46.4 kDa) is present primarily as a dimer (∼80%, molecular mass 113 kDa) along with a small but significant population of monomers (∼18%) and ∼2% higher order oligomers with an average molecular mass of ∼650 kDa (Fig. 2A) (35Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). The molecular mass line plots, which plot the mass throughout the peak, each have a steep slope, demonstrating that native Apo3G is polydisperse in aqueous solution in the presence of salt (200 mm Na2SO4). There appear to be unresolved monomers, trimers, and tetramers contained in the dimer peak (Fig. 2A, line plot, left y axis). This result is in contrast to the constant mass plotted throughout the peak of a monodisperse protein, i.e. bovine serum albumin (supplemental Fig. S2). Similar results for native Apo3G were found over a 4-fold concentration range, suggesting that dilution of the protein during gel filtration is unlikely to be causing dissociation of multisubunit structures (data not shown). We performed a MALS analysis on four Apo3G mutants predicted to interfere with oligomerization, based on crystal contacts in the Apo2 tetramer structure (28Prochnow C. Bransteitter R. Klein M.G. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2007; 445: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Two mutants are located in the N-terminal CD1 domain (F126A/W127A and Y124A/Y125A) and two are in the C-terminal CD2 domain (R313A/D316A/D317A/Q318A and I314A/Y315A). Mutant F126A/W127A causes a severe disruption in oligomer formation resulting in about 92% monomers and 8% dimers, with no larger oligomer forms detected (Fig. 2B, N-mutant F/W). The small population of dimers may result from residual CD1-CD1 interactions, perhaps from relatively weak tail-tail CD2-CD2 or head-tail CD1-CD2 interactions. It appears that the oligomer forms of Apo3G are stabilized in the presence of salt via hydrophobic interactions involving CD1, with just the two adjacent residues, Phe-126 and Trp-127, playing a dominant role. In contrast, the CD1 residues Tyr-124 and Tyr-125 have a far less significant role in oligomer formation. The mutant Y124A/Y125A is composed of roughly 47% monomers, 42% dimers, 10% tetramers, and 1% much larger molecular mass species (∼650 kDa) (Fig. 2C, N-mutant Y/Y). The absorbance chromatogram is used in place of the Rayleigh light-scattering ratio (35Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) to depict the forms for the Apo3G N-mutant Y124A/Y125A (Fig. 2C, chromatogram, right y axis) because of a stronger signal, but the two profiles are similar (data not shown). The molecular mass values associated with each absorbance peak are obtained from an analysis of MALS (35Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, line plot, left y axis). The quadruple mutant, R313A/D316A/D317A/Q318A, in the CD2 domain of Apo3G (Fig. 2D, C-mutant), corresponds to the region at the Apo2 tetrameric interface and predicted CD1 oligomerization region (residues 124–127), based on sequence alignment (supplemental Fig. S1). However, the CD2 domain does not contain the hydrophobic residues conserved in CD1 and Apo2; these residues have previously been shown to be involved in substrate specificity (29Holden L.G. Prochnow C. Chang Y.P. Bransteitter R. Chelico L. Sen U. Stevens R.C. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2008; 456: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 36Chen K.M. Harjes E. Gross P.J.

Yokoyama S. Takaku H. Katahira M. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 440-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Apo3G C-mutant (23% monomer, 65% dimer, Fig. 2D) and native Apo3G (18% monomer, 80% dimer, (Fig. 2A) are roughly comparable. However, the C-mutant contains about 12% tetramers with no larger oligomeric forms (Fig. 2D), whereas the native protein contains some tetramers (molecular mass ∼190 kDa), but they cannot be resolved in the dimer peak (Fig. 2A). Native Apo3G contains a small amount (∼2%) of 14 subunit oligomers, molecular mass ∼ 650 kDa (compare Fig. 2D with Fig. 2A). Apparently, these C-terminal residues are needed to form large oligomers, but because there is no substantial effect on dimer formation, perhaps these amino acids are restricted to tail-tail interactions (Fig. 1E). If this supposition is valid, then because the effects of mutating these C-terminal residues are relatively minor, it suggests that tail-tail interactions do not establish a major dimer interface, whereas the N-terminal CD1 residues do establish a major dimer interface via head-head interactions. Similar results were found with the C-terminal mutant I314A/Y315A (supplemental Fig. S3). The MALS analysis provides a characterization of native and mutant forms of Apo3G in solution in the absence of ssDNA (Fig. 2). The oligomeric forms of native Apo3G change significantly in the presence of ssDNA (23Chelico L. Sacho E.J. Erie D.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13780-13791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We used AFM to image the native and monomer N-mutant F/W forms of Apo3G with and without DNA (Fig. 3, supplemental Fig. S4). The volume of the deposited protein determined from the AFM images can be used to examine the distribution of oligomeric states because the AFM volume of proteins exhibits a linear relationship with molecular weight (32Ratcliff G.C.

Recent studies have shown that MOV10 plays an active role in the RNA interference pathway. Here, we report that MOV10 inhibits retrovirus replication. When it was overexpressed in viral producer cells, MOV10 was able to reduce the infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), simian immunodeficiency virus, and murine leukemia virus. Conversely, when MOV10 expression was reduced by small interfering RNAs, HIV-1 infectivity was increased. Consistently, silencing of MOV10 expression in a human T cell line enhanced HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, we found that MOV10 interacts with HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein in an RNA-dependent manner and is packaged into virions. It blocks HIV-1 replication at a postentry step. In addition, we also found that HIV-1 could suppress MOV10 protein expression to counteract this cellular resistance. All of these results indicate that MOV10 has a broad antiretroviral activity that can target a wide range of retroviruses, and it could be actively involved in host defense against retroviral infection.

IntroductionHelicases share seven conserved motifs (I, Ia, II, III, IV, V, and VI), and are classified into three superfamilies (SF-1 to SF-3) and two smaller families (F4 and F5) (1Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 2Jeang K.T. Yedavalli V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4198-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Most helicases belong to SF-2 and are known as DExH/D (DEAD, DEAH, DExH) box proteins that are named for a sequence fingerprint in the motif II.The MOV10 gene was discovered from the MOV-10 mouse strain. The MOV mouse strains were derived from preimplantation embryos infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV). 2The abbreviations used are: MLVmurine leukemia virusMOV10Moloney leukemia virus 10 proteinRNAiRNA interferencemiRNAmicroRNARISCRNA-induced silencing complexAgoArgonauteHIV-1human immunodeficiency virus type 1TRBPTAR RNA-binding proteinA3GAPOBEC3GA3FAPOBEC3FLucluciferaseVSVvesicular stomatitis virusGSTglutathione S-transferasemacrhesus macaquePBMCperipheral blood mononuclear cellSIVsimian immunodeficiency virusBlaMβ-lactamaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseVLPvirus-like particleNCnucleocapsid. A total of nine strains that carry a single copy of the provirus at different chromosomal positions were created and designated MOV-5 to MOV-13. Unlike most of the other strains, no viremia was developed in the MOV-10 mice, which indicated the provirus was inactive (3Jaenisch R. Jähner D. Nobis P. Simon I. Löhler J. Harbers K. Grotkopp D. Cell. 1981; 24: 519-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Later, it was found that this provirus is integrated into a gene locus that codes for a 110-kDa GTP-binding protein, which was named MOV10 (4Mooslehner K. Müller U. Karls U. Hamann L. Harbers K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MOV10 was classified as a SF-1 RNA helicase because of its DEAG fingerprint (5Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is expressed in a variety of cell types, including embryonic stem cells, and high levels of MOV10 transcripts are found at different stages of development in different organs such as testes and thymus (4Mooslehner K. Müller U. Karls U. Hamann L. Harbers K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of MOV10 remained unknown until its orthologs SDE3 in Arabidopsis (6Dalmay T. Horsefield R. Braunstein T.H. Baulcombe D.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2069-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and Armitage in Drosophila (7Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Wu J. Theurkauf W.E. Cell. 2004; 116: 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were found to play a critical role in the RNAi pathway.Originally discovered from transgenic plants, RNAi is a highly conserved gene regulation mechanism that silences genes in a sequence-specific manner, mainly via microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (8Lindbo J.A. Dougherty W.G. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2005; 43: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). miRNAs are from endogenous RNAs transcribed in the nucleus and are sequentially processed by the RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer. Small interfering RNAs are from exogenous double strand RNAs that are directly processed by Dicer in the cytoplasm. These small RNAs serve as guide RNAs and direct RISC to sequence-complementary mRNAs (9Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28978) Google Scholar). RISC, which either cleaves mRNAs or inhibits their translation to cause gene silencing, is a large molecular mass complex containing one of four Argonaute (Ago) proteins and several other proteins (10Meister G. Cell. 2007; 131: 25-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 11Peters L. Meister G. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Notably, miRNA-mediated silencing normally does not require perfect sequence complementary to the target mRNA, and one miRNA could potentially target 100 discrete mRNAs (12Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A. Schelter J.M. Castle J. Bartel D.P. Linsley P.S. Johnson J.M. Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3949) Google Scholar).SDE3 was isolated as the first non-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase factor in plants that amplifies RNAi by increasing the production of double strand RNA (6Dalmay T. Horsefield R. Braunstein T.H. Baulcombe D.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2069-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), whereas Armitage was found to be required for RISC assembly (7Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Wu J. Theurkauf W.E. Cell. 2004; 116: 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The role of MOV10 in RNAi was further highlighted in human. It was found that MOV10 not only interacts with Ago2 (13Meister G. Landthaler M. Peters L. Chen P.Y. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), but MOV10 also is associated with a multiprotein complex containing the HIV-1 TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) and eIF6, which are two additional important components of RISC (14Chendrimada T.P. Finn K.J. Ji X. Baillat D. Gregory R.I. Liebhaber S.A. Pasquinelli A.E. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2007; 447: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). A depletion of MOV10 from cells seriously compromised the activity of the RNAi pathway (13Meister G. Landthaler M. Peters L. Chen P.Y. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 14Chendrimada T.P. Finn K.J. Ji X. Baillat D. Gregory R.I. Liebhaber S.A. Pasquinelli A.E. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2007; 447: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In addition, MOV10 has been found to co-localize with Ago1 and Ago2 in mRNA processing (P) bodies and stress granules (13Meister G. Landthaler M. Peters L. Chen P.Y. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MOV10 also interacts with APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) in these cellular compartments (15Gallois-Montbrun S. Holmes R.K. Swanson C.M. Fernández-Ocaña M. Byers H.L. Ward M.A. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Gallois-Montbrun S. Kramer B. Swanson C.M. Byers H. Lynham S. Ward M. Malim M.H. J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 29105-29119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, although the precise role is still unclear, MOV10 is an important player in the RNAi pathway. Here, we demonstrate that MOV10 inhibits retrovirus replication.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have outlined several lines of evidence to show that MOV10 has antiretroviral activity: (i) overexpression of MOV10 reduced viral infectivity, and this activity required functional helicase motifs; (ii) reduction of MOV10 expression increased viral infectivity and enhanced viral replication; (iii) MOV10 was specifically encapsidated by the virus; (iv) MOV10 expression was suppressed when the virus established a productive infection. The fact that MOV10 from different species inhibited the replication of HIV-1, SIVs, and MLV indicates that this protein targets a wide range of retroviruses.Moreover, we have shown that MOV10 blocks virus replication at a postentry step. It specifically interacts with the NC domain of Gag in an RNA-dependent manner and is packaged into virions during assembly. MOV10 does not change viral RNA expression in viral producer cells. This is in sharp contrast to ZAP, which inhibits MLV replication by degrading viral mRNAs in the cytoplasm of viral producer cells. Interestingly, the action of ZAP is dependent on a DEAD box RNA helicase p72 (29Chen G. Guo X. Lv F. Xu Y. Gao G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4352-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is thought that p72 helps recruit the RNA-processing exosome for degradation. In addition, another helicase, RHA, that increases viral production, was also found to bind to NC, and it was speculated that RHA may increase viral RNA packaging by restructuring these RNAs (23Roy B.B. Hu J. Guo X. Russell R.S. Guo F. Kleiman L. Liang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12625-12635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have found that MOV10 does not affect viral RNA packaging or viral RNA dimerization, nor does it change the thermostability of the virion RNA dimers (supplemental Fig. S4). Thus, the specific mechanism by which MOV10 inhibits viral replication after entry into a target cell is still unclear. Also, it should be noted that the inactivation of MLV provirus in the MOV-10 mice should not have a direct link to MOV10 antiretroviral activity because later it was found that the provirus in these mice carries a mutation that prevents synthesis of infectious viruses (30Harbers K. Schnieke A. Stuhlmann H. Jaenisch R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2521-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Although MOV10 inhibits HIV-1 replication, the virus is able to counteract the effects of this host protein by suppressing its protein expression. The anti-HIV activity of MOV10 is reminiscent of that from A3G/A3F (31Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar, 32Wiegand H.L. Doehle B.P. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R.

Virol. 2004; 78: 6073-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and Tetherin (34Neil S.J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. Nature. 2008; 451: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). A3G and A3F are two cellular cytidine deaminases that restrict viral replication at the step of reverse transcription. Tetherin is an integral membrane protein that restricts viral replication at the step of viral release. However, HIV-1 produces two accessory proteins, Vif and Vpu, to counteract the effects of these antiviral proteins. Both Vif and Vpu can function as adaptor proteins that interact with a Cullin-5-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (35Yu X. Yu Y. Liu B. Luo K. Kong W. Mao P. Yu X.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), or a β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (36Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), respectively. Subsequently, Vif and Vpu target the A3G/A3F and BST-2 proteins to the proteasomal pathway for degradation. In the case of MOV10, HIV-1 was able to suppress its protein expression, and thereby its antiviral activity, via an unknown mechanism that does not seem to involve the proteasomal pathway. Thus, the antiviral activity of MOV10 and the suppression of MOV10 by HIV-1 are another arm wrestling match between host and virus, and over the course of evolution the virus again appear to have established a winning balance, which allows it to productively infect its host. Without using ΔVif and ΔVpu mutant viruses, the discovery of A3G/A3F and Tetherin activities would not have been possible. Similarly, without overexpressing MOV10 in viral producer cells to disrupt the established balance between HIV-1 and MOV10, it would have been impossible to detect the antiretroviral activity of MOV10. Thus, therapeutic approaches that increase MOV10 expression or inhibit HIV-1 suppression of MOV10 may become useful strategies to amplify this innate intracellular antiretroviral immunity and fight HIV infection. IntroductionHelicases share seven conserved motifs (I, Ia, II, III, IV, V, and VI), and are classified into three superfamilies (SF-1 to SF-3) and two smaller families (F4 and F5) (1Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 2Jeang K.T. Yedavalli V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4198-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Most helicases belong to SF-2 and are known as DExH/D (DEAD, DEAH, DExH) box proteins that are named for a sequence fingerprint in the motif II.The MOV10 gene was discovered from the MOV-10 mouse strain. The MOV mouse strains were derived from preimplantation embryos infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV). 2The abbreviations used are: MLVmurine leukemia virusMOV10Moloney leukemia virus 10 proteinRNAiRNA interferencemiRNAmicroRNARISCRNA-induced silencing complexAgoArgonauteHIV-1human immunodeficiency virus type 1TRBPTAR RNA-binding proteinA3GAPOBEC3GA3FAPOBEC3FLucluciferaseVSVvesicular stomatitis virusGSTglutathione S-transferasemacrhesus macaquePBMCperipheral blood mononuclear cellSIVsimian immunodeficiency virusBlaMβ-lactamaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseVLPvirus-like particleNCnucleocapsid. A total of nine strains that carry a single copy of the provirus at different chromosomal positions were created and designated MOV-5 to MOV-13. Unlike most of the other strains, no viremia was developed in the MOV-10 mice, which indicated the provirus was inactive (3Jaenisch R. Jähner D. Nobis P. Simon I. Löhler J. Harbers K. Grotkopp D. Cell. 1981; 24: 519-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Later, it was found that this provirus is integrated into a gene locus that codes for a 110-kDa GTP-binding protein, which was named MOV10 (4Mooslehner K. Müller U. Karls U. Hamann L. Harbers K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MOV10 was classified as a SF-1 RNA helicase because of its DEAG fingerprint (5Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is expressed in a variety of cell types, including embryonic stem cells, and high levels of MOV10 transcripts are found at different stages of development in different organs such as testes and thymus (4Mooslehner K. Müller U. Karls U. Hamann L. Harbers K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of MOV10 remained unknown until its orthologs SDE3 in Arabidopsis (6Dalmay T. Horsefield R. Braunstein T.H. Baulcombe D.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2069-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and Armitage in Drosophila (7Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Wu J. Theurkauf W.E. Cell. 2004; 116: 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were found to play a critical role in the RNAi pathway.Originally discovered from transgenic plants, RNAi is a highly conserved gene regulation mechanism that silences genes in a sequence-specific manner, mainly via microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (8Lindbo J.A. Dougherty W.G. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2005; 43: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). miRNAs are from endogenous RNAs transcribed in the nucleus and are sequentially processed by the RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer. Small interfering RNAs are from exogenous double strand RNAs that are directly processed by Dicer in the cytoplasm. These small RNAs serve as guide RNAs and direct RISC to sequence-complementary mRNAs (9Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28978) Google Scholar). RISC, which either cleaves mRNAs or inhibits their translation to cause gene silencing, is a large molecular mass complex containing one of four Argonaute (Ago) proteins and several other proteins (10Meister G. Cell. 2007; 131: 25-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 11Peters L. Meister G. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Notably, miRNA-mediated silencing normally does not require perfect sequence complementary to the target mRNA, and one miRNA could potentially target 100 discrete mRNAs (12Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A. Schelter J.M. Castle J. Bartel D.P. Linsley P.S. Johnson J.M. Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3949) Google Scholar).SDE3 was isolated as the first non-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase factor in plants that amplifies RNAi by increasing the production of double strand RNA (6Dalmay T. Horsefield R. Braunstein T.H. Baulcombe D.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2069-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), whereas Armitage was found to be required for RISC assembly (7Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Wu J. Theurkauf W.E. Cell. 2004; 116: 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The role of MOV10 in RNAi was further highlighted in human. It was found that MOV10 not only interacts with Ago2 (13Meister G. Landthaler M. Peters L. Chen P.Y. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), but MOV10 also is associated with a multiprotein complex containing the HIV-1 TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) and eIF6, which are two additional important components of RISC (14Chendrimada T.P. Finn K.J. Ji X. Baillat D. Gregory R.I. Liebhaber S.A. Pasquinelli A.E. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2007; 447: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). A depletion of MOV10 from cells seriously compromised the activity of the RNAi pathway (13Meister G. Landthaler M. Peters L. Chen P.Y. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 14Chendrimada T.P. Finn K.J. Ji X. Baillat D. Gregory R.I. Liebhaber S.A. Pasquinelli A.E. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2007; 447: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In addition, MOV10 has been found to co-localize with Ago1 and Ago2 in mRNA processing (P) bodies and stress granules (13Meister G. Landthaler M. Peters L. Chen P.Y. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MOV10 also interacts with APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) in these cellular compartments (15Gallois-Montbrun S. Holmes R.K. Swanson C.M. Fernández-Ocaña M. Byers H.L. Ward M.A. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Gallois-Montbrun S. Kramer B. Swanson C.M. Byers H. Lynham S. Ward M. Malim M.H. J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 29105-29119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, although the precise role is still unclear, MOV10 is an important player in the RNAi pathway. Here, we demonstrate that MOV10 inhibits retrovirus replication."

Recent studies have shown that WT1 negatively regulates WNT/β-catenin signaling, but the molecular mechanisms by which WT1 inhibits WNT/β-catenin signaling are not completely understood. In this study, we identified a gene, CXXC5, which we have renamed WID (WT1-induced Inhibitor of Dishevelled), as a novel WT1 transcriptional target that negatively regulates WNT/β-catenin signaling. WT1 activates WID transcription through the upstream enhancer region. In the developing kidney, Wid and Wt1 are coexpressed in podocytes of maturing nephrons. Structure-function analysis demonstrated that WID interacts with Dishevelled via its C-terminal CXXC zinc finger and Dishevelled binding domains and potently inhibits WNT/β-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo. WID is evolutionarily conserved, and ablation of wid in zebrafish embryos with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides perturbs embryonic kidney development. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the WT1 negatively regulates WNT/β-catenin pathway via its target gene WID and further suggest a role for WID in nephrogenesis.

Cancer. 2005; 5: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). About 10–15% of Wilms tumors have loss of function mutations in the Wilms tumor gene (WT1) encoding a zinc finger transcription factor indispensable during multiple stages of kidney development (2Schedl A.

Interestingly, activating mutations in CTNNB1 have been found more frequently in the tumors harboring WT1 mutations (6Li C.M. Kim C.E. Margolin A.A. Guo M. Zhu J. Mason J.M. Hensle T.W. Murty V.V.

Multiple isoforms of WT1 are produced as a result of different promoter usage, alternative splicing, internal translation, and alternative translational start (4Lee S.B. Haber D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 74-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These isoforms can be largely classified into two major isoforms, WT1(+KTS) and WT1(−KTS), distinguished by the presence or absence of three amino acids (lysine, threonine, and serine (KTS)) between zinc fingers 3 and 4 (15Haber D.A.

WT1(−KTS) functions as a transcription factor, whereas WT1(+KTS) has been implicated in post-transcriptional regulation (1Rivera M.N. Haber D.A. Nat. Rev.

The cytomegalovirus-driven full-length human WID (pCMVSport6-WID; GenBankTM accession number BC050046) and the human AXIN1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number BC044648) were purchased from ATCC. AXIN1 was subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). WID deletion mutants were generated by PCR (see supplemental material for primer sequence). Human IDAX cDNA was PCR-amplified and subcloned into pCMVSport6. All PCR-generated cDNAs were verified by sequencing.

Purified GST-Wid was used to obtain affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Strategic Biosolutions, Newark, DE). Total RNAs isolated from UB27 and UD29 cells (+ or − tet) were reverse-transcribed, and the expression levels of WID and GAPDH were analyzed by real time PCR using TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Data were analyzed by comparative Ct method using GAPDH as an endogenous control and expressed as fold differences to a reference value of WID in the presence of tet. For the quantification of the zebrafish β-catenin target gene (dkk-1), 1 μl of zebrafish cDNA from MO-injected embryos was used employing the QuantiTect SYBR Green real time PCR kit (Qiagen). All samples were measured as triplicates and normalized to the corresponding amounts of Danio rerio elongation factor-1α cDNA measured within the same plate. Relative expression levels were calculated using the Ct method. UB27 cells were cultured without tet for 16 h to induce WT1 expression, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as described previously (21Kim H.S. Kim M.S. Hancock A.L. Harper J.C.

NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of pcDNA3-WT1(−KTS) or the empty vector along with 0.1 μg of the enhancer-reporter and 0.01 μg of Renilla luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega). Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize transfection efficiency. To measure WNT-dependent T cell factor/β-catenin activity, 0.4 μg of pCMVSport6-WID, IDAX, or the empty vector was transfected into HEK293 cells together with 0.1 μg of Super8XTOPFlash and 0.01 μg of Renilla luciferase plasmids. After 46 h, cells were serum-starved for 6 h, stimulated with either control L or Wnt-3a CM for 6 h, and luciferase activities were measured. To examine the effects of WT1 on the WNT/β-catenin pathway, UB27 cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of Super8XTOPFlash and 0.01 μg of Renilla luciferase plasmids, and the following day, tet was removed to induce WT1 expression for 24 h. Cells were serum-starved for 6 h and stimulated with either control or Wnt3a CM for 6 h, and luciferase activity was measured as described. For the siRNA knockdown of WID in UB27 cells, cells were transfected twice with human WID siRNAs (see supplemental material) or control scrambled siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) along with Super8XTOPFlash and Renilla luciferase plasmids. After 24 h post-transfection, tet was removed to induce WT1 expression for 24 h. Cells were stimulated with either control or Wnt3a CM for 6 h, and luciferase activity was measured. Mouse L fibroblasts were transfected with two different Wid siRNAs (see supplemental material) or control scrambled siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) along with Super8XTOPFlash and Renilla luciferase plasmids. After 46 h, cells were serum-starved for 6 h and stimulated with either control or Wnt-3a CM for 6 h, and luciferase activity was measured. For the analysis of β-catenin, L cells were transfected with siRNA against Wid or control scrambled siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 48 h, cells were serum-starved for 6 h and treated with Wnt3a or control CM for 1 h, and total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), WID, and actin (Sigma). To visualize nuclear localization of β-catenin, L cells cultured on chambered coverglass (Nunc, Rochester, NY) were transfected with siRNA against Wid or control siRNA and treated with Wnt3a CM as described. Cells were fixed, immunostained with antibodies to WID and β-catenin (BD Biosciences), and visualized with Alexa 594 anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 488 anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Confocal images were captured with the Axio Observer Z1 inverted laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with LSM 5 Live confocal scanner (Zeiss). HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3-AXIN1, FLAG-Dvl2, and pCMVSport6-WID were lysed in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with either α-WID or α-FLAG antibodies (M2, Sigma) and immunoblotted with α-AXIN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-FLAG, or α-WID antibodies. For detecting the endogenous WID-DVL2 interaction, HEK293 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with α-WID antibody followed by immunoblotting with α-Dvl2 antibody (kindly provided by Mikhail V. Semenov, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston). Myc-DVL3, wild type WID, and the WID deletion mutants (WID-ΔDBD, WID-ΔCXXC, and WID-ΔCXXC-DBD) were synthesized in vitro using [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega). Similar amounts of 35S-labeled wild type WID or the deletion mutants and Myc-DVL3 were mixed in binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and the complex was immunoprecipitated with α-Myc antibody (Sigma) and analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. Mouse embryonic kidneys at 14.5 days post-coitum were isolated, fixed, and embedded in paraffin. After tissue sectioning, slides were heated in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, using a microwave oven after deparaffinization and rehydration. Serial sections were incubated anti-WT1 (BD Biosciences) or anti-WID antibodies and developed with Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For the analysis of headless phenotypes, ∼50–100 pg of each DNA, zebrafish Wnt8a expression plasmid (pCS2P+ wnt8 ORF1) and pCMVSport6-WID or pCMVSport6-IDAX, was injected through the chorion into the blastomere of one-cell wild type zebrafish embryos. For coinjection of two DNA, plasmids were mixed (1:1) prior to injection and injected into the 1-cell stage at 50 ng/μl (50–100 pg/embryo). After 5 days postfertilization, injected embryos were observed and scored for the headless, small eye, or rescued (wild type) phenotypes. The experiment was repeated three to four times. For the analysis of zebrafish kidney, we used the wt1b::GFP transgenic zebrafish line with pronephros-specific green fluorescent protein expression (22Perner B. Englert C. Bollig F. Dev. Biol. 2007; 309: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Embryos were raised at 28.5 °C and staged according to Kimmel et al. (23Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8862) Google Scholar). Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (see supplemental material for sequence) against either the first splice acceptor site (intron 1 to exon 2) of zebrafish wid pre-mRNA (called splice MO) or the wid start codon (called ATG MO) were dissolved in water (1 mm) and injected into the yolk of embryos in the 1–4-cell stage. A gradient of different injection volumes was tested for each morpholino to find the lowest morpholino amount, which leads to a consistent and reproducible phenotype (∼0.6 nl (0.6 pmol) for the wid splice and 0.3 nl (0.3 pmol) for the wid ATG morpholino, respectively). Embryos treated with 1-phenyl-2-thiourea and anesthetized with Tricaine (0.016%) were embedded in 1% low melting point agarose (Biozym, Hessisch Oldendorf, Germany) with their back facing the bottom of a μ-dish (ibidi GmbH, München, Germany) and photographed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss). We previously performed kinetic expression profiling analysis to identify WT1-regulated genes that might play important roles in kidney development (21Kim H.S. Kim M.S. Hancock A.L. Harper J.C. Park J.Y. Poy G. Perantoni A.O. Cam M. Malik K. Lee S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16278-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This analysis led us to identify a number of genes and novel ESTs induced by WT1(−KTS). Among them, three ESTs (GenBankTM accession numbers AK001782, BC006428, and BC002490) were derived from a single gene encoding a novel transcript termed CXXC5 in the data base (herein designated WID, see below for detail), which belongs to a recently identified gene family characterized by a CXXC motif (X is any amino acid) (24Katoh M. Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 25: 1193-1199PubMed Google Scholar). We first confirmed that WID is a direct transcriptional target of WT1 by examining the expression of endogenous WID upon induction of WT1(−KTS) or WT1(+KTS) using tet-repressible WT1-expressing cell lines (21Kim H.S. Kim M.S. Hancock A.L. Harper J.C. Park J.Y. Poy G. Perantoni A.O. Cam M. Malik K. Lee S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16278-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Following WT1(−KTS) expression, levels of the endogenous WID transcript increased rapidly and gradually decreased over time (Fig. 1A). Upon WT1(+KTS) expression, however, only a marginal increase in WID transcript levels was observed at 4 h. We also observed a concomitant increase in the levels of the endogenous WID protein shortly after the induction of WT1(−KTS) using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against WID (Fig. 1B). Next, we examined the WID proximal promoter region (∼5 kb upstream from exon 1) to determine whether WT1 might directly activate its transcription, but we found no evidence for WT1-mediated transactivation of the proximal WID promoter in a reporter assay (data not shown). Thus, we searched for conserved regulatory regions by comparing the genomic sequences of WID from human, rat, and mouse and identified three highly conserved regions, designated E1–E3, each containing multiple potential GC-rich WT1-binding sites (25Roberts S.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) located ∼10 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1). To determine whether WT1 was recruited to these sites, ChIP analysis was performed. The results demonstrated that WT1(−KTS) was present in the putative enhancer regions E1 and E3 but not at E2 nor in the adjacent regions designated N1 and N2 (Fig. 1C). An independent quantitative ChIP analysis confirmed this finding (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Each putative enhancer region was then inserted upstream of a minimal promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid and tested in the reporter assay. The E1 region, positioned in either direction, was activated 5–6-fold by WT1(−KTS), whereas the E2 and E3 regions were only modestly activated (Fig. 1E). To further examine WT1-mediated transactivation of the enhancers, we deleted at least three to four putative WT1-binding sites from each of the enhancer regions and tested in the reporter assay. Deletion of multiple potential WT1 sites in the E1 had no effect on the ability of WT1 to activate the reporter, suggesting the existence of other WT1-binding sites (supplemental Fig. S2). This is not surprising given the presence of high GC-rich sequences throughout the enhancer (supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, deletion of four putative binding sites in the E3 region resulted in 40% reduction in the WT1-mediated activation, demonstrating that WT1, at least partially, activates E3 enhancer through one or more of the deleted WT1 sites (supplemental Fig. S2). Because WT1 was not recruited to the E2 region by ChIP (Fig. 1, C and D), a modest activation from the E2 region by WT1(−KTS) might be due to an indirect mechanism in a manner similar to the WT1-SF1-mediated activation of the Müllerian-inhibiting substance promoter, which is independent of WT1 binding to the DNA (26Nachtigal M.W. Hirokawa Y. Enyeart-VanHouten D.L. Flanagan J.N. Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Thus, deletion of three putative WT1-binding sites in E2 had no effect on the reporter activity (supplemental Fig. S2). Collectively, these results suggest that WT1(−KTS) activates the transcription of WID through the upstream enhancer region. Sequence analysis of WID by a BLASTP search identified another CXXC family protein, CXXC4, also known as IDAX (Inhibitor of Dishevelled and Axin) (27Hino S. Kishida S. Michiue T. Fukui A. Sakamoto I. Takada S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 330-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), with a high degree of homology to the C terminus of WID (supplemental Fig. S3). The C-terminal regions of WID and IDAX contain the CXXC domain as well as highly conserved sequences flanking the CXXC motif. The N-terminal half of WID does not share significant homology with any other protein and contains an unusually high number of serine, alanine, and glycine residues (comprising 51.6% of the first 167 residues). Because IDAX has been shown to inhibit WNT/β-catenin signaling (27Hino S. Kishida S. Michiue T. Fukui A. Sakamoto I. Takada S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 330-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we tested whether WID might also function as a negative regulator of the WNT pathway by using a Super8XTOPFlash luciferase reporter assay to measure the activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway (28Veeman M.T. Slusarski D.C. Kaykas A. Louie S.H. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 680-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Upon transfection of the reporter plasmid into HEK293 cells and treatment with Wnt3a CM, a 10-fold induction of the luciferase activity was observed as compared with the control CM (Fig. 2A). In contrast, cotransfection of WID with the luciferase reporter led to a severe repression (∼5-fold reduction) of Wnt3a-mediated reporter activity. As expected, coexpression of IDAX also led to the inhibition of WNT/β-catenin signaling. We observed a similar inhibition of Wnt3a signaling by WID in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast, mouse L-fibroblast, and U2OS human osteosarcoma cell lines (data not shown). We next examined the effects of Wid depletion on the activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway using the Super8XTOPFlash reporter assay. Suppression of endogenous Wid in mouse L fibroblasts using two different small interfering RNAs (siRNA) resulted in a significantly higher level of the Wnt3a-mediated luciferase activity than the control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). To further study the inhibitory effect of WID on the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, we examined the level of β-catenin after reducing endogenous Wid levels by siRNAs. In the absence of Wnt3a, suppression of Wid led to a slight increase in β-catenin levels compared with the control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2C, compare lane 1 with lanes 3 and 5). In the presence of Wnt3a, depletion of Wid resulted in a greater accumulation of β-catenin compared with the control (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 2, 4, and 6). This was further confirmed by confocal microscopy, which showed about 2-fold increase in the nuclear localization of β-catenin in Wnt3a-treated Wid depleted cells compared with the control (Fig. 2D). Together, these observations clearly demonstrate the role of WID as the negative regulator of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. Next, we examined whether WID inhibits WNT signaling in vivo. To this end, we used a previously described zebrafish model in which ectopic expression of zebrafish Wnt8 cDNA driven from a constitutive promoter causes either a headless or a small eye phenotype (29Kelly G.M. Greenstein P. Erezyilmaz D.F. Moon R.T. Development. 1995; 121: 1787-1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When zebrafish Wnt8 cDNA was injected into fish embryos, approximately two-thirds of the injected embryos displayed either the headless (∼60%) or the small eye (∼17%) phenotype (Fig. 2E). Coinjection of Wnt8 and WID cDNAs, however, resulted in less than 5% of the embryos with the headless phenotype, and ∼70% of the embryos displayed normal head development, demonstrating that WID functions as a negative regulator of the WNT pathway in zebrafish. As expected, coinjection of IDAX also reversed the Wnt8-induced headless phenotype but less efficiently than WID (Fig. 2E). Because WT1(−KTS) activates endogenous WID expression (Fig. 1), a potent inhibitor of WNT/β-catenin signaling, we tested whether WT1(−KTS) expression alone can inhibit WNT/β-catenin signaling. To this end, we transfected the Super8XTOPFlash plasmid into the WT1(−KTS)-inducible cell line and examined the reporter activity with or without WT1 expression. In the absence of WT1(−KTS) expression (+tet), Wnt3a activated the luciferase reporter to ∼5-fold (Fig. 3A). In contrast, expression of WT1(−KTS) (−tet) resulted in a marked decrease (∼2-fold) in the Wnt3a-mediated reporter activity, demonstrating that WT1(−KTS) can negatively regulate the WNT/β-catenin signaling. Reduction of WID by siRNA following WT1(−KTS) expression resulted in a partial loss of the WT1-mediated inhibition of WNT/β-catenin signaling as compared with the control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that WT1-induced repression of WNT/β-catenin signaling is at least partially mediated through WID. Western blot analysis confirmed the induction of WT1 and reduction of WID expression (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). Activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling is mediated by the direct binding of Dishevelled (DVL) to a complex containing AXIN-APC-GSK3β (30Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. De Ferrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that IDAX might inhibit WNT/β-catenin signaling by directly interacting with DVL (27Hino S. Kishida S. Michiue T. Fukui A. Sakamoto I. Takada S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 330-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine whether WID can physically interact with DVL, we introduced FLAG-tagged DVL2, and WID into HEK293 cells followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-WID antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, WID readily formed a complex with DVL2 but not with AXIN. A reciprocal immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody also demonstrated the interaction of DVL2 and WID. We further confirmed the interaction between endogenous WID and DVL2 in HEK293 cells by immunoprecipitating the endogenous WID, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-DVL2 antibody (Fig. 4B).

These functions are regulated by intrinsic seven transmembrane-spanning receptors, the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R) and frizzled (FZD), through their respective ligands, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and Wnt. FZD activation of canonical β-catenin signaling requires the adapter protein Dishevelled (Dvl). We identified a Dvl-binding motif in the PTH1R. Here, we report that the PTH1R activates the β-catenin pathway by directly recruiting Dvl, independent of Wnt or LRP5/6. PTH1R coimmunoprecipitated with Dvl. Deleting the carboxyl-terminal PTH1R PDZ-recognition domain did not abrogate PTH1R-Dvl interactions; nor did truncating the receptor at position 480. However, further deletion eliminating the putative Dvl recognition domain abolished PTH1R interactions with Dvl. PTH activated β-catenin in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and translocated β-catenin to the nucleus. β-Catenin activation was inhibited by Dvl2 dominant negatives and by short hairpin RNA sequences targeted against Dvl2. PTH-induced osteoclastogenesis was also inhibited by Dvl2 dominant negative mutants. These findings demonstrate that G protein-coupled receptors other than FZD directly activate β-catenin signaling, thereby mimicking many of the functions of the canonical Wnt-FZD pathway.

MAPKs are commonly divided into three subgroups: extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs), p38s, and JNKs. Notably, JNKs phosphorylate key regulatory proteins that control the cellular response to cytokine stimulation, stress factors, and cytotoxic and genotoxic agents that ultimately dictate cell fate -survival or death. Three major JNK isoforms have been characterized in mammals (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3) that might have distinct physiological functions (1Weston C.R. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar).The ability of a cell to divide, which translates into its capacity to undergo a regulated cell cycle, is mostly controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (2Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 630-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In particular, Cdk1 has emerged as the master regulator of progression through mitosis. Cdk1 activation is a highly regulated event that involves binding to the regulatory/activatory subunit cyclin B together with the removal of inhibitory phosphorylation events occurring in the activation loop of Cdk1 (threonine 14 and tyrosine 15) that are mediated by the Wee1-Myt1 family of kinases. Thus, dephosphorylation of Cdk1 is essential for its activation, and it is accomplished by the family of Cdc25 phosphatases composed of three members: Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C (3Boutros R. Dozier C. Ducommun B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 4Boutros R. Lobjois V. Ducommun B. Nat. Rev.

Biophys. 2005; 43: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For instance, ERK1/2 were recently found to regulate the activation of Cdc25C during the G2/M transition both in mammals and in Xenopus laevis (6Wang R. He G. Nelman-Gonzalez M. Ashorn C.L.

Cross J.V. Ma K. Qian Y. Mola P.W. Templeton D.J. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of this event remained unclear. Here, we show that phosphorylation of Cdc25C at Ser-168 occurs during both unperturbed cell cycle progression and induction of the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint. Moreover, our data reveal that this phosphorylation is required for proper entry into mitosis and efficient checkpoint arrest after UV irradiation.DISCUSSIONMounting evidence links cell cycle regulation with JNK activity. The present study offers a mechanistic insight into important cell cycle components that are regulated by JNK. Here we demonstrate that JNK phosphorylation of Cdc25C at Ser-168 during G2 phase and early mitosis negatively regulates its phosphatase activity and thereby Cdk1 activation, enabling a timely control of mitosis onset.Our findings were uncovered in part through the use of the JNK-ΔKEN mutant, a cell cycle-stabilized form of JNK that elicits a gain-of-function phenotype through accumulation of elevated levels of activatable JNK. We show that JNK-ΔKEN preferentially targets a larger population of Cdc25C (and presumably other Cdc25 family members) than the endogenous JNK. This increased regulation might also be explained by the localization of the JNK-ΔKEN mutant that seems to selectively accumulate in the nucleus, 4G. J. Gutierrez and Z. A. Ronai, unpublished results. where activated Cdc25C has been reported to be localized during the G2/M transition (37Perry J.A. Kornbluth S. Cell Div. 2007; 2: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Regulation of other members of the Cdc25 family by JNK and other stress-related kinases clearly will become an area for future investigation (42Uchida S. Yoshioka K. Kizu R. Nakagama H. Matsunaga T. Ishizaka Y. Poon R.Y. Yamashita K. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 6438-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The unrestrained phosphorylation by JNK, as obtained by its cell cycle-stabilized form, mimics a constitutive activation of JNK, as often seen in human tumors. Consistent with this idea are the findings that glioblastoma and melanoma tumor cell lines harboring high levels of JNK activity also display increased phosphorylation of Cdc25C at Ser-168. However, JNK hyperactivation is also required for the viability and the (abnormal) proliferation of these tumor cells. These findings suggest that constitutively active JNK, as observed in these tumors, is likely to elicit a gain-of-function phenotype that participates in the cancer-associated aberrant cell cycle and genomic instability features. Therefore, identification of relevant targets for JNK related to cell cycle control will be of exquisite interest for cancer research.Finally, our data reveal that induction of the G2/M checkpoint after DNA damage, such as under UV irradiation, requires inactivation of Cdc25C by JNK phosphorylation. Consistent with the notion that JNK activity is important for cell cycle progression are the findings that inhibition of JNK activity, either by pharmacological inhibitors, RNAi, or genetic deletions, impairs the G2/M transition and cell cycle progression (12Potapova O.

Of note, histone H3 and aurora B were recently suggested as cell cycle regulatory proteins that could be affected by either JNK or the JNK-c-Jun axis, respectively, during the cell cycle (31Lee K. Song K. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32Oktay K. Buyuk E. Oktem O. Oktay M. Giancotti F.G. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that JNK may also affect substrates other than members of the Cdc25 family of phosphatases. Overall, the finding that JNK phosphorylation of Cdc25C is required for this important checkpoint offers new insight into the underlying direct mechanisms linking stress signals to cell cycle control. IntroductionMitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 3The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseERKextracellular-regulated kinaseCDKcyclin-dependent kinaseHEKhuman embryonic kidneyMEFmurine embryonic fibroblastDKOdouble-knock-outPBSphosphate-buffered salineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorter. are implicated in proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. MAPKs are commonly divided into three subgroups: extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs), p38s, and JNKs. Notably, JNKs phosphorylate key regulatory proteins that control the cellular response to cytokine stimulation, stress factors, and cytotoxic and genotoxic agents that ultimately dictate cell fate -survival or death. Three major JNK isoforms have been characterized in mammals (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3) that might have distinct physiological functions (1Weston C.R. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar).The ability of a cell to divide, which translates into its capacity to undergo a regulated cell cycle, is mostly controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (2Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 630-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In particular, Cdk1 has emerged as the master regulator of progression through mitosis. Cdk1 activation is a highly regulated event that involves binding to the regulatory/activatory subunit cyclin B together with the removal of inhibitory phosphorylation events occurring in the activation loop of Cdk1 (threonine 14 and tyrosine 15) that are mediated by the Wee1-Myt1 family of kinases. Thus, dephosphorylation of Cdk1 is essential for its activation, and it is accomplished by the family of Cdc25 phosphatases composed of three members: Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C (3Boutros R. Dozier C. Ducommun B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 4Boutros R. Lobjois V. Ducommun B. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar).Growing evidence points to fine-tuning of cell cycle by MAPKs (5MacCorkle R.A. Tan T.H. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 43: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For instance, ERK1/2 were recently found to regulate the activation of Cdc25C during the G2/M transition both in mammals and in Xenopus laevis (6Wang R. He G. Nelman-Gonzalez M. Ashorn C.L.

Moreover, activation of p38α was recently reported during the G2/M transition of the unperturbed cell cycle when it negatively targets Cdc25B (7Cha H. Wang X. Li H. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22984-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, JNKs (and in particular JNK2) have been found to be essential for the proliferation and survival of several cell lines obtained from gastrointestinal and prostate tumors, leukemia, melanoma, and glioblastoma (8Xia H.H.

Finally, initial studies in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from JNK knock-out mice suggested that JNK1 is a negative and JNK2 a positive cell cycle regulator (17Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D.

First, UV-induced G2/M checkpoint activation induces the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Cdc25A (21Busino L. Donzelli M. Chiesa M. Guardavaccaro D. Ganoth D. Dorrello N.V. Hershko A.

Moreover, Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylates Cdc25B/C and negatively regulates their activity via cytoplasmic sequestration instigated by 14-3-3 proteins (23Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S.

Finally, other kinases, such as p38s and MAPKAPK2, are also known to regulate Cdc25B/C localization and action by regulating, via phosphorylation, their interaction with 14-3-3s (25Bulavin D.V.

IL-10 inhibits inflammation by suppressing HuR-mediated mRNA stabilization of proinflammatory cytokines. Here we report that following MI, IL-10−/− mice showed exaggerated LV dysfunction, fibrosis, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of HuR in the myocardium significantly reversed MI-induced LV dysfunctions and LV remodeling. HuR knockdown significantly reduced MI-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis concomitant with reduced p53 expression. Moreover, HuR knockdown significantly reduced infarct size and fibrosis area, which in turn was associated with decreased TGF-ß expression. In vitro, stable knockdown of HuR in mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 corroborated in vivo data and revealed reduced mRNA expression of TNF-α, TGF-ß, and p53 following LPS challenge, which was associated with a marked reduction in the mRNA stability of these genes. Taken together, our studies suggest that HuR is a direct target of IL-10, and HuR knockdown mimics anti-inflammatory effects of IL10.—Krishnamurthy, P., Lambers, E., Verma, S., Thorne, T., Qin, G., Losordo, D.

https://openalex.org/W2156661766,"Dishevelled (Dvl) is a multifunctional effector of different Wnt cascades. Both canonical Wnt3a and noncanonical Wnt5a stimulate casein-kinase-1 (CK1) -mediated phosphorylation of Dvl, visualized as electrophoretic mobility shift [phosphorylated and shifted Dvl (ps-Dvl)]. However, the role of this phosphorylation remains obscure. Here we report the functional interaction of ps-Dvl with the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2, which is an alternative Wnt receptor and is able to inhibit canonical Wnt signaling. We demonstrate interaction between Ror2 and ps-Dvl at the cell membrane after Wnt3a or Wnt5a stimulus dependent on CK1. Ps-Dvl interacts with the C-terminal proline-serine-threonine-rich domain of Ror2, which is required for efficient inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling. We further show that the Dvl C terminus, which seems to be exposed in ps-Dvl and efficiently binds Ror2, is an intrinsic negative regulator of the canonical Wnt pathway downstream of ß-catenin. The Dvl C terminus is necessary and sufficient to inhibit canonical Wnt/ß-catenin signaling, which is dependent on the presence of Ror2. Furthermore, both the Dvl C terminus and CK1E can inhibit the Wnt5a/Ror2/ATF2 pathway in mammalian cells and Xenopus explant cultures. This suggests that phosphorylation of Dvl triggers negative feedback regulation for different branches of Wnt signaling in a Ror2-dependent manner.—Witte, F., Bernatik, O., Kirchner, K., Masek, J., Mahl, A., Krejci, P., Mundlos, S., Schambony, A, Bryja, V., Stricker, S.

Unfortunately few pharmaceutical agents have proven to be efficacious in treating cognitive impairment. As such, the medical need for new therapeutic approaches for improving cognitive deficits has emerged as an important frontier in treating central nervous system diseases. Glutamate mediates the vast majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the CNS with post-synaptic signaling regulated by either ligand-gated cation channels (ionotropic) or G-protein-coupled receptors (metabotropic). Ionotropic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors are tetrameric aggregates composed of combinations of one or more of four subunits (GluR1–4) that can each bind a glutamate neurotransmitter molecule. Upon binding of glutamate, the associated ion channel pore opens, allowing cations to cross the membrane and depolarize the postsynaptic cell. Termination of the postsynaptic signal is driven primarily by the removal of glutamate from the synaptic cleft, reducing the occupancy of the glutamate binding site and subsequent channel closure (deactivation). Additionally, the conduction pathway will close in the continued presence of bound agonist as a result of conformational changes secondary to glutamate binding (desensitization).AMPA receptor pharmacology has identified agonists, competitive and non-competitive antagonists, and positive allosteric modulators (3Kew J.N. Kemp J.A. Psychopharmacology. 2005; 179: 4-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). This latter class of pharmacologic agent, the positive allosteric modulator or AMPA potentiator, enhances agonist-evoked currents by slowing deactivation and/or desensitization but does not evoke a response when applied in the absence of agonist. These AMPA-potentiators demonstrate modulation of the excitatory post-synaptic currents in vitro and in vivo and are efficacious in animal cognition models such as novel object recognition (4Silvers J.M. Harrod S.B. Mactutus C.F. Booze R.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2007; 166: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and radial arm maze (5Olton D.S. Physiol. Behav. 1987; 40: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Levin E.D. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1988; 12: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). AMPA potentiators are believed to increase cognition by enhancing synaptic transmission and plasticity and by stimulating release of neurotrophins (7Lynch G. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2006; 6: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).The nootropic agents such as aniracetam and piracetam have been used clinically to treat cognitive impairment and have also been shown to enhance AMPA receptor function. However, the marginal efficacy of these first generation compounds has led to interest in developing agents that are more potent and selective enhancers of AMPA receptor function. Although several novel AMPA receptor potentiators meeting these criteria have advanced to clinical testing, none is yet approved, and there remains opportunity for new molecules of this general class (8Lynch G. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 9Black M.D. Psychopharmacology. 2005; 179: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Francotte P. de Tullio P.

IDrugs. 2007; 10: 185-192PubMed Google Scholar).Typically primary, transformed, or genetically engineered cell lines are used for developing cell-based assays in drug discovery. Stem cells offer distinct advantages because of their ability to differentiate into genetically and functionally normal cells (12McNeish J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For AMPA receptors, this is particularly relevant due to the multitude of distinct AMPA receptor subtypes formed as mixtures of four subunits, each having flip and flop splice isoforms. Adding to this complexity are striking GluR subunit editing by double-stranded RNA, developmentally regulated alternative splicing, and transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) that modulate desensitization and pharmacology (1Schoft V.K. Schopoff S. Jantsch M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2Kato A.S. Siuda E.R. Nisenbaum E.S. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 2008; 59: 986-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).From the perspective of developing a novel therapeutic agent, it is not clear that any one or more combinations of subunits and associated proteins is more or less desirable than the others. Therefore, mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells were differentiated into neuronal precursor cells that consistently expressed functional AMPA receptors. It was speculated that this approach would offer the potential to interrogate an array of AMPA receptors comprising different and possibly naturally occurring subunit combinations with the goal of casting a broad net in the HTS.Herein we report the development and application of an mES cell-derived neuronal HTS that was used to assay more than 2.4 million small molecules. From this effort, small drug-like molecules were discovered and subjected to further evaluation to assess their functional and binding properties. In addition, selected molecules were tested in human ES cell-derived neurons to assess translation from mouse to human receptors. To our knowledge this is the first report of any stem cell-based HTS being employed to identify biologically active lead molecules for a pharmacologically relevant target. Importantly, this approach can potentially be used for other central nervous system drug targets that are not easily reconstituted using traditional expression systems.DISCUSSIONThe overriding goal of drug discovery is to rapidly identify novel compounds with the potential for superior clinical efficacy and safety. Typically, in vitro and in vivo models are identified and optimized to ensure that targets are validated, lead molecules are rapidly identified, and potential candidates are selected for characterization in human clinical trials. Stem cells have a more innate cellular background than typical exogenous expression systems that may provide a more predictive cell-based screening strategy for small molecule lead identification. Herein, we have described a mouse ES cell-based approach to primary screening that resulted in the identification of novel small molecule AMPA-type glutamate receptor potentiators. Although AMPA potentiators are of interest in enhancing cognition for several CNS disorders, this stem cell-based screening strategy could be used in the identification of substrates for other CNS targets. Currently, artificially engineered cells or primary cells from fetal rat brains are used for CNS assays, and although many successful cell-based HTS have been developed, many have not been optimal. In the case of G-protein-coupled receptors, for instance, a number of important variables may exist with these systems including stoichiometry of the target receptors versus the endogenous cell populations and proper signaling within the engineered cells. The mES cell-derived neurons provide a novel alternative for identifying AMPA potentiators that exploits endogenously expressed glutamate receptors that potentially represent the range and stoichiometry of subunit combinations and splice isoforms. The HTS identified two novel chemical structures with positive AMPA activity that were confirmed in secondary assays and in human ES cell-derived neuron FLiPR assay. Further evaluation of these newly identified structures and related analogs as leads in the development of new therapies for cognition enhancement continues and will be reported in due course.One concern of stem cell based screen was that the cells would express multiple receptors and signaling pathways that could elicit a Ca2+ signal in the FLiPR assay. This could produce an unmanageable number of false positives in a single addition assay. However, the criteria used for selecting compounds that were inactive when added alone, but demonstrated enhanced Ca2+ flux when evoked by AMPA, appeared to eliminate the vast majority of compounds that acted as either direct agonist of AMPA receptors or on receptors that also couple to Ca2+. Therefore, stem cell-based screening assays are likely to be useful for target mechanisms that can be isolated from other systems in the stem cell derivatives, such as the case of allosteric modulators. Advances in automation and miniaturization have resulted in HTS of chemical libraries, often exceeding a million individual molecules, and is the major lead-generating technology employed in the pharmaceutical industry. In this work we coupled the advantages of stem cell biology and HTS to identify new lead molecules in an important area of unmet medical need. Specifically, a murine embryonic stem cell-derived assay has been developed to screen a compound file containing more than two million compounds. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that heretofore no stem cell-based assay has been employed in a HTS on the order of 106 compounds or more.

IntroductionCognitive impairment is a fundamental trademark of many CNS 2The abbreviations used are: CNScentral nervous systemAMPAα-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionateHTShigh-throughput screen(ing)ESembryonic stemmESmouse ESiPSinduced pluripotent stemFLiPRfluorimetric imaging plate readerCTZcyclothiazideDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEBembryoid bodyKSRknock-out serum replacementGABAergicaminobutyric acid-ergicFGFfibroblast growth factorPBSphosphate-buffered salineTHtyrosine hydroxylaseGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinChATcholinesterol acelyltransferaseGABAγ-aminobutyric acid. diseases such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Unfortunately few pharmaceutical agents have proven to be efficacious in treating cognitive impairment. As such, the medical need for new therapeutic approaches for improving cognitive deficits has emerged as an important frontier in treating central nervous system diseases. Glutamate mediates the vast majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the CNS with post-synaptic signaling regulated by either ligand-gated cation channels (ionotropic) or G-protein-coupled receptors (metabotropic). Ionotropic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors are tetrameric aggregates composed of combinations of one or more of four subunits (GluR1–4) that can each bind a glutamate neurotransmitter molecule. Upon binding of glutamate, the associated ion channel pore opens, allowing cations to cross the membrane and depolarize the postsynaptic cell. Termination of the postsynaptic signal is driven primarily by the removal of glutamate from the synaptic cleft, reducing the occupancy of the glutamate binding site and subsequent channel closure (deactivation). Additionally, the conduction pathway will close in the continued presence of bound agonist as a result of conformational changes secondary to glutamate binding (desensitization).AMPA receptor pharmacology has identified agonists, competitive and non-competitive antagonists, and positive allosteric modulators (3Kew J.N. Kemp J.A. Psychopharmacology. 2005; 179: 4-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). This latter class of pharmacologic agent, the positive allosteric modulator or AMPA potentiator, enhances agonist-evoked currents by slowing deactivation and/or desensitization but does not evoke a response when applied in the absence of agonist. These AMPA-potentiators demonstrate modulation of the excitatory post-synaptic currents in vitro and in vivo and are efficacious in animal cognition models such as novel object recognition (4Silvers J.M. Harrod S.B. Mactutus C.F. Booze R.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2007; 166: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and radial arm maze (5Olton D.S. Physiol. Behav. 1987; 40: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Levin E.D. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1988; 12: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). AMPA potentiators are believed to increase cognition by enhancing synaptic transmission and plasticity and by stimulating release of neurotrophins (7Lynch G. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2006; 6: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).The nootropic agents such as aniracetam and piracetam have been used clinically to treat cognitive impairment and have also been shown to enhance AMPA receptor function. However, the marginal efficacy of these first generation compounds has led to interest in developing agents that are more potent and selective enhancers of AMPA receptor function. Although several novel AMPA receptor potentiators meeting these criteria have advanced to clinical testing, none is yet approved, and there remains opportunity for new molecules of this general class (8Lynch G. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 9Black M.D. Psychopharmacology. 2005; 179: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Francotte P. de Tullio P.

IDrugs. 2007; 10: 185-192PubMed Google Scholar).Typically primary, transformed, or genetically engineered cell lines are used for developing cell-based assays in drug discovery. Stem cells offer distinct advantages because of their ability to differentiate into genetically and functionally normal cells (12McNeish J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For AMPA receptors, this is particularly relevant due to the multitude of distinct AMPA receptor subtypes formed as mixtures of four subunits, each having flip and flop splice isoforms. Adding to this complexity are striking GluR subunit editing by double-stranded RNA, developmentally regulated alternative splicing, and transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) that modulate desensitization and pharmacology (1Schoft V.K. Schopoff S. Jantsch M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2Kato A.S. Siuda E.R. Nisenbaum E.S. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 2008; 59: 986-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).From the perspective of developing a novel therapeutic agent, it is not clear that any one or more combinations of subunits and associated proteins is more or less desirable than the others. Therefore, mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells were differentiated into neuronal precursor cells that consistently expressed functional AMPA receptors. It was speculated that this approach would offer the potential to interrogate an array of AMPA receptors comprising different and possibly naturally occurring subunit combinations with the goal of casting a broad net in the HTS.Herein we report the development and application of an mES cell-derived neuronal HTS that was used to assay more than 2.4 million small molecules. From this effort, small drug-like molecules were discovered and subjected to further evaluation to assess their functional and binding properties. In addition, selected molecules were tested in human ES cell-derived neurons to assess translation from mouse to human receptors. To our knowledge this is the first report of any stem cell-based HTS being employed to identify biologically active lead molecules for a pharmacologically relevant target. Importantly, this approach can potentially be used for other central nervous system drug targets that are not easily reconstituted using traditional expression systems.

DISCUSSIONThe overriding goal of drug discovery is to rapidly identify novel compounds with the potential for superior clinical efficacy and safety. Typically, in vitro and in vivo models are identified and optimized to ensure that targets are validated, lead molecules are rapidly identified, and potential candidates are selected for characterization in human clinical trials. Stem cells have a more innate cellular background than typical exogenous expression systems that may provide a more predictive cell-based screening strategy for small molecule lead identification. Herein, we have described a mouse ES cell-based approach to primary screening that resulted in the identification of novel small molecule AMPA-type glutamate receptor potentiators. Although AMPA potentiators are of interest in enhancing cognition for several CNS disorders, this stem cell-based screening strategy could be used in the identification of substrates for other CNS targets. Currently, artificially engineered cells or primary cells from fetal rat brains are used for CNS assays, and although many successful cell-based HTS have been developed, many have not been optimal. In the case of G-protein-coupled receptors, for instance, a number of important variables may exist with these systems including stoichiometry of the target receptors versus the endogenous cell populations and proper signaling within the engineered cells. The mES cell-derived neurons provide a novel alternative for identifying AMPA potentiators that exploits endogenously expressed glutamate receptors that potentially represent the range and stoichiometry of subunit combinations and splice isoforms. The HTS identified two novel chemical structures with positive AMPA activity that were confirmed in secondary assays and in human ES cell-derived neuron FLiPR assay. Further evaluation of these newly identified structures and related analogs as leads in the development of new therapies for cognition enhancement continues and will be reported in due course.One concern of stem cell based screen was that the cells would express multiple receptors and signaling pathways that could elicit a Ca2+ signal in the FLiPR assay. This could produce an unmanageable number of false positives in a single addition assay. However, the criteria used for selecting compounds that were inactive when added alone, but demonstrated enhanced Ca2+ flux when evoked by AMPA, appeared to eliminate the vast majority of compounds that acted as either direct agonist of AMPA receptors or on receptors that also couple to Ca2+. Therefore, stem cell-based screening assays are likely to be useful for target mechanisms that can be isolated from other systems in the stem cell derivatives, such as the case of allosteric modulators. Advances in automation and miniaturization have resulted in HTS of chemical libraries, often exceeding a million individual molecules, and is the major lead-generating technology employed in the pharmaceutical industry. In this work we coupled the advantages of stem cell biology and HTS to identify new lead molecules in an important area of unmet medical need. Specifically, a murine embryonic stem cell-derived assay has been developed to screen a compound file containing more than two million compounds. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that heretofore no stem cell-based assay has been employed in a HTS on the order of 106 compounds or more. The work described here was accomplished using mouse ES cells; however, recent advances suggest that hES cell-derived neurons can be reproducibly scaled and quality-controlled during differentiation to consider moving directly to primary HTS in human cells (26Shin S.

IntroductionThe ion channel repertoire of neurons contributes critically to the regulation of neuronal activity. The response of a neuron to an incoming input depends (among other factors) on the molecular composition of its ion channels, their relative abundance, their subcellular location, and the fine tuning of their biophysical properties (1Zhang W. Linden D.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 885-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 2Beck H. Yaari Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Mechanisms that control the function, expression levels, and/or subcellular localization of ion channels can influence neuronal function in many ways and at different time scales (1Zhang W. Linden D.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 885-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 2Beck H. Yaari Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). During the past decade, dynamic regulations of ion channel trafficking and surface expression have emerged as pivotal mechanisms in many forms of neuronal plasticity. However, whereas substantial advances have been made in uncovering the cellular dynamics of synaptic ion channel trafficking (3Kennedy M.J. Ehlers M.D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 325-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), less is known about the transport of extrasynaptic dendritic channels that contribute to intrinsic excitability.Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 2The abbreviations used are: HCNhyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cationGFPgreen fluorescent proteinNMDAN-methyl-d-aspartic acidAMPAα-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionateDIVday(s) in vitroHAhemagglutininMAP2microtobule-associated protein 2GAD-65glutamic acid decarboxylase 65Pnpostnatal day n. channels are a family of voltage-gated ion channels that mediate a non-selective cationic current named Ih. Unlike other voltage-gated ion channels, members of the HCN family are activated upon hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, and this unusual feature endows them with unique and versatile roles in the regulation of neuronal excitability (4Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 453-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The subcellular distribution of HCN channels varies in different cell types and brain regions and is important for determining the effects that these channels exert on neuronal excitability (5Santoro B. Baram T.Z. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 550-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For example, in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, HCN1 channels are concentrated in the apical dendrites, and channel density is much higher in the distal compared with the proximal dendritic span (6Lörincz A. Notomi T. Tamás G. Shigemoto R. Nusser Z. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This gradient has been shown to contribute to normalizing dendritic inputs arriving at different locations along the dendrite (7Magee J.C. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In another region of the hippocampal formation, the entorhinal cortex, HCN1 channels are enriched in axon terminals during development, and this localization is developmentally regulated, diminishing in the adult (8Bender R.A. Kirschstein T. Kretz O. Brewster A.L. Richichi C. Rüschenschmidt C. Shigemoto R. Beck H. Frotscher M. Baram T.Z. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4697-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, patterns of distribution of HCN1 channels have been recently shown to depend on neuronal network activity. Elimination of synchronized neuronal input to the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons abolished the gradient of HCN1 channel distribution (9Shin M. Chetkovich D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33168-33180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and manipulation of activity levels modified the axonal presynaptic expression of HCN1 in entorhinal cortex neurons (8Bender R.A. Kirschstein T. Kretz O. Brewster A.L. Richichi C. Rüschenschmidt C. Shigemoto R. Beck H. Frotscher M. Baram T.Z. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4697-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These forms of activity-dependent regulation of HCN channel distribution take place at time scales of days. However, it is unknown if HCN channel transport to subcellular compartments and modulation of surface expression of the channels may take place more rapidly, at the time scale of minutes. These alterations in channel distribution, in turn, might provide the basis for rapid changes in Ih that contribute to types of neuronal plasticity that take place within minutes (10van Welie I. van Hooft J.A. Wadman W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 5123-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 11Fan Y. Fricker D. Brager D.H. Chen X. Lu H.C. Chitwood R.A. Johnston D. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1542-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).In this study, we sought to examine directly the dynamics of HCN channel trafficking and surface expression and their rapid regulation by neuronal activity. Although heterologous expression systems provide valuable information regarding basic cellular processes, the complexity of neuronal systems imposed by the polarized morphology of neurons and their unique electrical activity cannot be reproduced in heterologous models. Therefore, we expressed GFP-fused HCN channels in cultured hippocampal neurons and employed time lapse imaging to study the kinetics of the trafficking of these channels. We found that HCN1-GFP channel proteins were expressed on the cell membrane of hippocampal neurons, where they exhibited biophysical properties similar to wild-type channels. Time-lapse live imaging revealed that HCN1-GFP channel protein was present in vesicle-like organelles that moved bidirectionally along dendrites, and these distribution patterns and mobility differed from those of the HCN2 channel isoform. Trafficking of HCN1-GFP puncta required actin and microtubules and was drastically inhibited by exposure to the excitatory amino acid glutamate, via a process that involved calcium and both NMDA- and AMPA-type glutamate receptors. The rapid glutamate-induced arrest of HCN1 channel movement was associated with a reversible increase of HCN1 channel surface expression and with augmented Ih. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of HCN1 channel trafficking and suggest a novel mechanism by which neuronal activity can up-regulate Ih within minutes via alterations of HCN1 channel trafficking and surface expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHippocampal Cell CultureDissociated hippocampal primary cultures were prepared from postnatal day 0 (P0) Sprague-Dawley rats. Hippocampi were quickly dissected, removed from adherent meninges, and incubated for 30 min in buffered salt solution containing 10 units/ml papain (Worthington). After removal of the papain, cells were mechanically triturated and plated at a density of 400–600 cells/mm2 on 12-mm coverslips that were precoated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma). Cultures were initially maintained in Neurobasal Medium with B-27 supplement (Invitrogen) at 36 °C and 5% CO2. 3–4 h after plating, half of the culture medium was replaced with a Neurobasal Medium/B-27-based medium that was preconditioned for 24 h by 1–2-week old non-neuronal cell culture prepared from P3-P4 rat cortices. Cultures were subsequently refreshed every 3–4 days with the conditioned medium. On the third day in vitro (DIV), 1 μm cytosine-arabinoside (Sigma) was added to the culture medium to inhibit glial proliferation. All experiments complied with National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) and University of California, Irvine (Irvine, CA) animal care regulations.Plasmid DNA ConstructscDNA constructs containing the GFP sequence in the C terminus of the mouse HCN1 cDNA (inserted between amino acid residues 885 and 886) or the hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the HCN1 extracellular domain between transmembrane domains S3 and S4 (residues 231–232) were generated as described previously (12Lewis A.S. Schwartz E. Chan C.S. Noam Y. Shin M. Wadman W.J. Surmeier D.J. Baram T.Z. Macdonald R.L. Chetkovich D.M. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6250-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The N terminus GFP-conjugated mHCN1 (HCN1-GFPn) and mHCN2 (HCN2-GFP) constructs were a gift from Dr. Santoro (Columbia University); previous studies found that the two constructs yielded functional Ih with biophysical properties typical for the respective isoform expressed in heterologous systems (13Santoro B. Wainger B.J. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10750-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). mCherry-HCN1 was created by inserting the cDNA encoding mCherry from pRSET-B-mCherry (generously provided by Dr. Roger Tsien, University of California, San Diego) instead of the GFP in the AgeI/XhoI site of the HCN1-GFPn construct.Neuronal Transfection of Plasmid DNAPrimary neuronal cultures were transfected with plasmid DNA constructs on DIV 7–10, using the Lipofectamine 2000 method (Invitrogen). Transfection mixtures that included 100 μl of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen), 2 μg of Lipofectamine, and 0.5–1 μg of plasmid DNA were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then added to each coverslip. To reduce potential toxicity of the lipocationic transfection reagent, the transfection mixture was removed entirely at 1.5–2 h post-transfection, and cultures were refreshed with Neurobasal Medium plus B-27 medium that was CO2- and temperature-equilibrated prior to transfection, as described in a previously published protocol (14Misonou H. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; 144: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The membrane capacitance of transfected neurons as measured by whole-cell voltage clamp recording (32.2 ± 2.5 picofarad; n = 19) was not different from that of age-matched, naive, non-transfected neurons (33.8 ± 6.4 picofarads; n = 9; p > 0.05) or of non-transfected neurons that were exposed to the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent for a similar duration of time (33.0 ± 5.0 picofarad; n = 6; p > 0.05). GFP signal was detected in transfected neurons as early as 6 h after transfection, was stable during the 24–48 h time window, and persisted for a minimum of 72 h post-transfection. Therefore, all experiments were performed 24–48 h post-transfection. Pilot experiments demonstrated that transfection efficiency was 2–6% when using 0.5–1 μg of plasmid DNA per coverslip. Increasing DNA concentrations did not result in higher transfection efficiency, and reducing DNA amounts below 0.5 μg resulted in a significant reduction in transfection efficiency (<1%).Disruption of Microtubules and ActinTo test the involvement of cytoskeletal elements in HCN trafficking, jasplakinolide (Invitrogen) or nocodazole (Sigma) was freshly diluted from frozen stock aliquots to a final concentration of 0.5 and 10 μm, respectively, in 0.06% DMSO (vehicle control).Time Lapse Live Imaging and AnalysisLive cultured neurons expressing HCN1-GFP or HCN2-GFP were either kept in bath solution (see below) or subjected to increased synaptic excitation via the application of glutamate (10 μm for 10 min). In experiments testing the involvement of ionotropic glutamate receptors, the specific NMDA receptor blocker amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (100 μm; Sigma) or the AMPA receptor blocker 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (50 μm; Sigma) was added to the bath solution 10 min prior to imaging. Neurons were imaged using a Nikon TE-2000U inverted microscope, using a ×40 objective (numerical aperture 0.60). Coverslips were placed in a bath chamber containing HEPES-buffered bath solution: 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.40. The bath solution was adjusted with sucrose to 290–300 mosm and kept at 34–36 °C throughout the experiment. In experiments testing the role of extracellular calcium, calcium was excluded from the HEPES-buffered solution described above, and 5 mm EGTA was added. Cells with a healthy appearance and relatively low HCN1-GFP or HCN2-GFP expression levels were selected for imaging and analysis. Only one cell was chosen from each coverslip, to minimize interdependence of observations. In most time lapse sessions, 39 images were acquired at intervals of 5 s (total time, 190 s), with an exposure time of 500 ms/image. In experiments involving more than two imaging sessions (e.g. studies of the reversibility of the glutamate effect on HCN1-GFP trafficking), only 20 or 25 images were taken per session, to limit photobleaching. Images were captured using a CCD monochrome 12-bit camera (Retiga 2000R; Qimaging), acquired with NIS-Elements-D software (Nikon), and colorized for presentation.For the analysis of puncta mobility, a custom-written program in MATLAB (Mathworks) was used, which enabled manual tracking of single puncta and storage of relevant information for each punctum (such as the kinetic properties of the movement, location, size, and light intensity). To be classified as “mobile,” puncta had to move >0.36 μm (equivalent to >2 pixels) at least twice during the sampling period. Analyses of velocity, pause time, and directionality (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4) were based on mobile puncta only, which comprised 27.7% of the total HCN1-GFP puncta population (based on >1500 puncta from 11 neurons) and 6.1% of HCN2-GFP (based on 498 puncta from 6 neurons; see Fig. 4). The directionality index presented in Fig. 3F was calculated for each punctum using the following formula,Directionality=∑Ddistal−∑Dproximal∑Dtotal(Eq. 1) where Ddistal represents the distance traveled by a punctum away from the soma during the sampling period, Dproximal represents the distance traveled toward the soma, and Dtotal represents the total distance traveled in both directions. If a punctum moved exactly the same distance toward and away from the soma, its directionality index would be 0 (representing a bidirectional punctum), whereas a movement solely in one direction would yield a value of −1 for a pure centripetal movement and +1 for a pure centrifugal movement. The absolute value of directionality (Fig. 3G) represents the degree to which a puncta was uni- or bidirectional.FIGURE 4Isoform specificity of the expression and trafficking patterns of the HCN1 and HCN2 channel isoforms. A, an image of the GFP signal emitted by a live neuron (9 DIV), 26 h after transfection with the HCN2-GFP channel construct. Whereas, similar to HCN1-GFP, HCN2-GFP expression was apparent in soma and dendrites, the distribution pattern of HCN2-GFP was more diffuse, with fewer identifiable puncta (for a comparison, see live neuron expressing HCN1-GFP in Fig. 3A). B, analysis of 498 dendritic HCN2-GFP puncta from six cells (derived from three independent experiments with separate cultures) revealed that only a small subpopulation of HCN2-GFP puncta was mobile (6.1% ± 2.1%), significantly less than for HCN1-GFP (27.7% ± 6.1%). C–E, the small subpopulation of mobile HCN2-GFP puncta traveled smaller distances compared with HCN1-GFP, as quantified by the mean total distance traveled during the 190-s imaging period (C). The reduced mobility of HCN2-GFP puncta coincided with their longer stationary periods (D), whereas mean velocity corrected for immobile periods did not differ between HCN1- and HCN2-GFP puncta (E). F, the isoform-specific distribution of HCN1- and HCN2-GFP channels persisted when they were co-transfected in the same neurons; in a live neuron co-transfected with mCherry-fused HCN1 and GFP-fused HCN2 at a 1:1 cDNA ratio, HCN1 molecules were distributed in a more punctate pattern when compared with HCN2. G, an enlarged image of a dendritic segment taken from the cell in F. Puncta are indicated by arrows.

Scale bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The time course of the glutamate-induced arrest shown in Fig. 6B was calculated by quantifying the fraction of mobile puncta (normalized to the total puncta population for each cell) throughout the sampling period and then binning it into 30-s time frames (the first 10 s of the 190-s imaging period were not included in the analysis to enable equally binned periods of 30 s). Pooled, quantitative analysis of HCN1-GFP mobility under different conditions (Fig. 6E) was performed as follows. The fraction of mobile puncta was calculated for each cell during the 3-min imaging epoch prior to treatment and during the 3-min epoch starting 7 min following treatment. The post-treatment value was then expressed as a percentage of the pretreatment value for each cell. Statistical significance was determined using a paired t test (two-tailed). Kymographs were generated in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), using the “multiple kymograph” plug-in (J. Rietdorf and A. Seitz). All analyses were performed without knowledge of the experimental condition.FIGURE 6HCN1 channel trafficking is reversibly arrested by activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors by an extracellular calcium dependent mechanism. A, kymographs representing HCN1-GFP puncta movement in dendrites and its inhibition by 10 μm glutamate. B, time course of glutamate-induced arrest of HCN1 channels; quantitative analysis of puncta movements in two representative neurons (vehicle and glutamate-treated) before as well as during the 1–4 min epoch and the 7–10 min epochs after treatment. Drastic suppression of puncta mobility was apparent already at 1 min post-glutamate and persisted for at least 10 min, whereas no reduction of movement occurred in vehicle-treated neurons. C, quantitative analysis of the number of mobile puncta in neurons exposed to 10 μm glutamate or to vehicle treatment for 10 min. Paired data points represent the number of mobile puncta in the same neuron before and after treatment. D, the reduction in the fraction of mobile puncta at 10 min post-glutamate (gray column in the left column pair) was reversed after an additional recovery period of 30 min. At that time point, the fraction of mobile puncta (gray column in the right pair of columns) did not differ significantly from the pretreatment value (blank column). There was no significant change in puncta mobility in vehicle-treated neurons throughout the duration of the experiment. E, in the presence of either the AMPA receptor blocker 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) or the NMDA receptor blocker amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), glutamate (glut.) no longer arrested puncta mobility (p > 0.05). In addition, application of glutamate in a calcium-free solution failed to suppress HCN1-puncta mobility. Puncta were tracked in 4–9 neurons/group (>7000 puncta in total).

Antibodies used included rabbit anti-HCN1 (1:4000; Chemicon; Lot number 0605029427), guinea pig anti-HCN1 (1:4000) (9Shin M. Chetkovich D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33168-33180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), or monoclonal mouse anti-HCN1 (1:4000; NeuroMab; clone N70/2); mouse anti-GAD-65 (1:1000; Roche Applied Science); mouse anti-MAP-2 (1:16000; Sigma); and monoclonal mouse anti-α-tubulin (1:1000 Sigma). Immunolabeling of endogenous HCN1 (Fig. 3A) was accomplished using tyramide signal amplification according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Labeling of F-actin was accomplished by incubating neurons with 165 nm Alexa-Fluor 568-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 30 min, followed by rigorous washes.Differential Labeling of Internal and Surface HCN1 Channel ProteinLabeling of surface HA-HCN1 channels was performed on live neurons without detergents (to avoid cell permeabilization). First, HA-HCN1-transfected cultures were incubated with either glutamate or bath solution (vehicle) at 36 °C in a manner similar to that described for the time lapse imaging experiments. After a 10-min incubation, cultures were transferred to 4 °C (to arrest trafficking processes) and incubated with mouse monoclonal HA antibody (1:100; Covance; clone 16B12) for 40 min, followed by a 15-min incubation with Alexa-488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:600; Invitrogen). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and blocked, followed by overnight incubation with monoclonal rat anti-HA (1:500; Roche Applied Science; clone 3F10) at 4 °C, to label the remaining (intracellular) HA-HCN1 channels. Antibody displacement was unlikely in this experimental set-up because fixation of the cells after surface labeling with the first primary antibody stabilized the antibody-antigen complex. Images were captured using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus IX-70), with a LaserSharp 2000 (Bio-Rad) acquisition software. Images were acquired with a ×60 objective (numerical aperture 1.40), except for the image in Fig. 1D, which was obtained with a ×20 objective. Imaging of surface HA-HCN1 channels was performed with equal exposure parameters for all neurons of the same experiment, and neurons from three independent experiments (2–4 coverslips/condition/experiment) were imaged and analyzed. Three apical dendritic segments, located 50–200 μm away from the soma, were selected per neuron. For each dendritic segment, background intensity levels were measured, and only pixels that had intensity values significantly higher (p < 0.05) than background were included in the analyses. Using the histogram function in the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health), pixels with significant signal intensity in the green or red color channels (representing surface and intracellular HA-HCN1 channels, respectively) were counted, and a surface/total ratio was derived. In total, 33 dendritic segments from 11 cells were analyzed per condition.FIGURE 1Expression pattern of HCN1-GFP channel protein in hippocampal neurons.

Similar results were generated using a commercial anti-HCN1 serum (supplemental Fig. 2). Insets, higher magnification of a segment of a dendrite. C, labeling with an antibody against MAP-2, a dendritic marker, revealed that HCN1-GFP channel protein was expressed along dendrites. D, HCN1-GFP was expressed in principal neurons, as indicated by the lack of its co-localization with a GAD-65 antibody. Note the GAD-65-positive bipolar shaped neuron adjacent to the HCN1-GFP transfected, GAD-65-negative cell. Scale bars, 10 μm. The similarity between the expression pattern of HCN1-GFP and native HCN1 channels is apparent when comparing this figure to supplemental Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ElectrophysiologyIh was recorded from visually identified pyramidal-like neurons in dissociated hippocampal cell cultures using standard whole-cell patch clamp techniques. The bath solution contained 125 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm dextrose. The bath solution was bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and continuously superfused at a rate of 1–1.5 ml/min. In initial experiments aimed to characterize Ih in cultured hippocampal neurons, BaCl2 (0.5 mm) was added to block inward rectifier potassium currents (Ik(ir)), and NiCl2 (0.1 mm) was added to block low threshold calcium currents. Tetrodotoxin (0.5–1 mm) was added to suppress action potentials, and amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (20 μm), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (10 μm), and bicuculline (5 μm) were added to block spontaneous synaptic events. When modulation of Ih by activity was examined, none of the blockers mentioned above were added. Recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter Instruments). The pipette was filled with 120 mm potassium gluconate, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES, 4.0 mm Na2-ATP, 0.3 mm Na2-GTP, adjusted to pH 7.3 with Tris-Cl and adjusted to 295 mosm. Pipette resistance as measured in the bath solution was 4–6 megaohms. Data were collected using an Axopatch 700A amplifier, a Digidata 1322A 16-bit data acquisition system, and pClamp software version 9.2 (Molecular Devices). Voltage and current traces were filtered at 1 and 5 kHz and digitized at 10 and 20 kHz, respectively. Measurements of membrane input resistance (Rm) and capacitance (Cm) were performed by applying a 10-mV test pulse from a holding potential of −70 to −60 mV for a duration of 10 ms. Calculation of final Cm and Rm values followed the method first described by Lindau and Neher (15Lindau M. Neher E. Pflugers Arch. 1988; 411: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Ih was evoked by 5-s-long hyperpolarizing pulses starting from a holding potential of −50 mV and carried out in increments of −10 mV (maximal step = −120 mV). At the end of the hyperpolarizing pulse, the membrane potential was stepped to −65 mV to record tail currents. To measure the effect of neuronal activation on Ih, a base line was first obtained by recording Ih 7–10 min after reaching the whole-cell configuration; glutamate (10 μm) was then applied to the bath solution for 10–15 s, followed by recordings of Ih (voltage steps were applied from resting holding potential to −100 mV) in intervals of 5 min. Recordings were made at 30–32 °C.The amplitude and kinetic properties of Ih were analyzed using Clampfit 9.2, Origin 6 (OriginLab), and GraphPad PRISM 2.0 (GraphPad). Final graphs were produced in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). Current amplitude was determined by subtracting the instantaneous current at the beginning of the voltage step from the susta"

Because metallothionein (MT) has a role in prevention of oxidative and ER stress, we examined the effects of MT on the development of obesity induced by 27 wk of a high-fat diet (HFD) in female MT-I- and MT-II-null (MT−/−) and wild-type (MT+/+) mice. Body weight, fat mass, and plasma cholesterol increased at a greater rate in MT−/− mice fed an HFD than in MT −/− mice fed a control diet (CD) and MT+/+ mice fed an HFD, indicating that MT−/− mice fed an HFD became obese and hypercholesterolemic and that MT could prevent HFD-induced obesity. The observed increases in the levels of plasma leptin and leptin mRNA in the white adipose tissue of MT−/− mice fed the HFD suggested a leptin-resistant state. Enhanced expression of a mesoderm-specific transcript, which regulates the enlargement of fat cells, was accompanied by enlarged adipocytes in the white adipose tissue of young MT −/− mice before obesity developed after 3 and 8 wk of feeding the HFD. Thus, MT may have a preventive role against HFD-induced obesity by regulating adipocyte enlargement and leptin signaling.—Sato, M., Kawakami, T., Kondoh, M., Takiguchi, M., Kadota, Y., Himeno, S., Suzuki, S.

Modified proteins were immunogenic, and a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 27Q4 that cross-reacted with the protein covalently modified with 2-nonenal was raised from mouse. To verify the presence of the protein-bound 2-nonenal in vivo, the mAb 27Q4 against the 2-nonenal-modified keyhole limpet hemocyanin was raised. It was found that a novel 2-nonenal-lysine adduct, cis- and trans-Nϵ-3-[(hept-1-enyl)-4-hexylpyridinium]lysine (HHP-lysine), constitutes an epitope of the antibody. The immunoreactive materials with mAb 27Q4 were detected in the kidney of rats exposed to ferric nitrilotriacetate, an iron chelate that induces free radical-mediated oxidative tissue damage. Using high performance liquid chromatography with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, we also established a highly sensitive method for detection of the cis- and trans-HHP-lysine and confirmed that the 2-nonenal-lysine adducts were indeed formed during the lipid peroxidation-mediated modification of protein in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we examined the involvement of the scavenger receptor lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1 in the recognition of 2-nonenal-modified proteins and established that the receptor recognized the HHP-lysine adducts as a ligand. trans-2-Nonenal is an unsaturated aldehyde with an unpleasant greasy and grassy odor endogenously generated during the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. 2-Nonenal covalently modified human serum albumin through a reaction in which the aldehyde preferentially reacted with the lysine residues.

Lipid peroxidation in tissue and in tissue fractions represents a degradative process, which is the consequence of the production and propagation of free radical reactions primarily involving membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as in drug-associated toxicity, postischemic reoxygenation injury, and aging (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). The peroxidative breakdown of polyunsaturated fatty acids has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of many types of liver injuries and especially in the hepatic damage induced by several toxic substances. The lipid peroxidation leads to the formation of a broad array of different products with diverse and powerful biological activities. Among them are a variety of different aldehydes (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5902) Google Scholar). The primary products of lipid peroxidation, lipid hydroperoxides, can undergo carbon-carbon bond cleavage via alkoxyl radicals in the presence of transition metals giving rise to the formation of short-chain, unesterified aldehydes or a second class of aldehydes still esterified to the parent lipid. These reactive aldehydic intermediates readily form covalent adducts with cellular macromolecules, including protein, leading to the disruption of important cellular functions. The important agents that give rise to the modification of protein may be represented by α,β-unsaturated aldehydic intermediates, such as 2-alkenals, 4-hydroxy-2- alkenals, and 4-oxo-2-alkenals (3Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 4Marnett L.J. Riggins J.N. West J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). 2-Alkenals represent a group of highly reactive aldehydes containing two electrophilic reaction centers. A partially positive carbon 1 or 3 in such molecules can attack nucleophiles, such as protein. It has been suggested that these aldehydes primarily react with the sulfhydryl group of cysteine, the ϵ-amino group of lysine, and the imidazole group of histidine in the proteins (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5902) Google Scholar, 3Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Among the 2-alkenals, 2-nonenal (Fig. 1A) has a characteristically unpleasant greasy and grassy odor. It is also a major contributor to the unpleasant cardboard flavor in aged beer. It was previously shown that 2-nonenal could be formed through lipid peroxidation as a minor product in peroxide- mediated oxidation of high concentrations of linoleic acid hydroperoxide or from liver microsomes treated with ADP/iron in vitro (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5902) Google Scholar). Toyokuni et al. (5Toyokuni S. Luo X.P. Tanaka T. Uchida K. Hiai H. Lehotay D.C.

More recently, Haze et al. (6Haze S. Gozu Y. Nakamura S. Kohno Y. Sawano K. Ohta H. Yamazaki K. J. Invest.

They have also suggested that cis-2-nonenal and trans-2-nonenal are formed from the oxidative degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as palmitoleic acid. However, it is still not clear how 2-nonenal could be formed in vivo. Because of its insolubility in water, 2-nonenal is less reactive with proteins than other 2-alkenals, such as acrolein and crotonaldehyde, and therefore has received relatively little attention as a causative agent for modification of proteins. Only inhibition of enzymes, such as platelet membrane-bound phosphotyrosine phosphatase (7Hernández-Hernández A. Sánchez-Yagüe J. Martín-Valmaseda E.M. Llanillo M. Free Radic. Biol.

A structurally diverse protein supergroup called scavenger receptors mediates the cellular uptake of modified lipoproteins. Scavenger receptors are expressed by endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells and mediate recognition, internalization, and physiological responses to a wide range of ligands, including phospholipids, lipoprotein particles, apoptotic cells, and pathogens. Several oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors have been identified so far, including SR-A I/II, CD36, SR-BI, FcγRII, lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor (LOX-1), macrosialin, SR expressed by endothelial cells, etc. Among them, LOX-1 is characterized as the major receptor for oxidized LDL in the endothelial cells of large arteries. Its inducible expression (9Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar) might be involved in the oxidized LDL-mediated endothelial dysfunction. LOX-1 exhibits a binding activity for multiple ligands. LOX-1 is capable of interacting with a variety of structurally and functionally distinct ligands, including oxidized LDL, platelets, aged red blood cells, apoptotic cells, advanced glycation end products, heat shock protein 70, bacteria, and phosphatidylserine (10Chen X.P. Zhang T.T. Du G.H. Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 2007; 25: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). LOX-1 binds and internalizes a diverse array of macromolecules, although their structures are not always related to each other. In this study, to understand the mechanism underlying the formation of a covalently modified protein with 2-nonenal in vivo, we raised a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against protein-bound 2-nonenal and identified a novel 2-nonenal-lysine adduct as the epitope. Our immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the localization of the immunoreactive materials in the kidney of rats exposed to Fe3+-NTA, an iron chelate that induces acute renal proximal tubular necrosis, a consequence of free radical-mediated oxidative tissue damage, eventually leading to a high incidence of renal adenocarcinoma in rodents. Importantly, using high performance liquid chromatography with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS/MS), we also showed evidence that the 2-nonenal-lysine adduct is indeed accumulated during the lipid peroxidation-mediated modification of protein in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, to evaluate the biological implication of the 2-nonenal modification of protein, we examined the involvement of LOX-1, a member of the scavenger receptor family, in the recognition of the 2-nonenal-lysine adducts. trans-2-Nonenal (2-nonenal), Nα-acetyl-l-lysine, and human serum albumin (HSA) were obtained from the Sigma. Acrolein was obtained from Tokyokasei (Tokyo, Japan). Nα-[U-13C6,15N2]Fmoc-Nϵ-boc-lysine (where boc is t-butoxycarbonyl) was obtained from the Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). The keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was obtained from Pierce. Ferric nitrate nonahydrate, sodium carbonate, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from Wako (Osaka, Japan), and the nitrilotriacetic acid disodium salt was from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). The Fe3+-NTA solution was prepared immediately before use by the method described in a previous study (11Toyokuni S. Uchida K. Okamoto K. Hattori-Nakakuki Y. Hiai H. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The stock solutions of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal were prepared by the acid treatment (1 mm HCl) of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal dimethyl acetal, which was synthesized according to the procedure of De Montarby et al. (12De Montarby L. Mosset P. Gree R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 3937-3940Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 4-Oxo-2-nonenal was synthesized by the oxidation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal dimethyl acetal with pyridinium dichlorochromate, followed by HCl hydrolysis (13Rindgen D. Nakajima M. Wehrli S. Xu K. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The sodium salt of malondialdehyde was prepared by the Dowex hydrolysis of malondialdehyde bis(diethyl acetal) (14Marnett L.J. Tuttle M.A. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 276-282PubMed Google Scholar). Other aldehydes were purchased from Wako. Modification of the protein by 2-nonenal and its related short-chain aldehydes was performed by incubating HSA (1.0 mg/ml) with 0–10 mm 2-nonenal in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 37 °C for 24 h. The Fe2+-catalyzed oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in the presence of HSA was performed by incubating HSA (1 mg/ml) with 2 mm unsaturated fatty acids in the presence of 50 μm Fe2+ and 1 mm ascorbic acid in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, in atmospheric oxygen at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mm butylated hydroxytoluene and 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. LDL (1.019–1.063 g/ml) was prepared from the plasma of healthy humans by sequential ultracentrifugation and then extensively dialyzed three times against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.01% EDTA at 4 °C. LDL used for the oxidative modification by Cu2+ was dialyzed five times against a 1000-fold volume of PBS at 4 °C. The oxidation of LDL was performed by incubating 0.5 mg of LDL with CuSO4 (5 μm) in 1 ml of PBS for 24 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mm EDTA and then stored at 4 °C. An aliquot (0.2 ml) of the protein samples (1 mg/ml) incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 2-nonenal was treated with 10 mm EDTA (20 μl), 1 n NaOH (20 μl), and 100 mm sodium borohydride (20 μl). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, 20 μl of 2 n HCl was added to the mixture to stop the reaction, and the mixture was then incubated for 60 min at room temperature after adding 280 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the proteins were hydrolyzed in vacuo with 2 ml of 6 n HCl for 24 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysates were then dried and dissolved in sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.15. The amino acid analysis was performed using a JEOL JLC-500 amino acid analyzer equipped with a JEOL LC30-DK20 data analyzing system. The immunogen was prepared by incubating the KLH (1.0 mg/ml) with 10 mm 2-nonenal in 3 ml of PBS at 37 °C for 24 h. We immunized the female BALB/c mice (Chubu Kagaku Shizai Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan) on day 1 with complete Freund adjuvant and 0.06 mg of immunogen (2-nonenal-modified KLH) and boosted on days 11, 21, and 31 with incomplete Freund adjuvant and 0.02 mg of immunogen by emulsifying and intraperitoneal injection. Titers to 2-nonenal-modified BSA in the immunized mice sera were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (15Toyoda K. Nagae R. Akagawa M. Ishino K. Shibata T. Ito S. Shibata N. Yamamoto T. Kobayashi M. Takasaki Y. Matsuda T. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25769-25778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two months after the initial immunization, the immunized mice were given an intraperitoneal boost of 0.06 mg/ml 2-nonenal-modified KLH. Three days later, the spleen cells from the immunized mice were fused with P3/U1 murine myeloma cells in the presence of polyethylene glycol and cultured in hypoxanthine/amethopterin/thymidine selection medium. The culture supernatants of the hybridoma were screened using an ELISA, employing pairs of wells of microtiter plates on which were absorbed 2-nonenal-treated BSA as the antigen (0.5 μg of protein/well). After incubation with 100 μl of the hybridoma supernatants, and with intervening washes with PBS/Tween, the wells were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, followed by a substrate solution containing 0.5 mg/ml 1,2-phenylenediamine. Hybridoma cells corresponding to the supernatants that were positive on the 2-nonenal-modified BSA and negative on the native BSA were then cloned by limited dilution. After repeated screening, four clones were obtained. Among them, clone 27Q4 showed the most significant recognition of the 2-nonenal-modified BSA. Competitors were prepared by incubating 50 mm amino acid derivatives, Nα-acetyl-l-lysine, Nα-acetylhistidine, or Nα-acetylcysteine, in the presence or absence of 2-nonenal (50 mm), in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 24 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture (6 ml) contained 200 mm trans-2-nonenal and 200 mm Nα-acetyl-l-lysine in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. After incubation for 72 h at 37 °C, a portion of the reaction mixture was analyzed by a reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Nomura Chemicals) equilibrated in a solution of 5% acetonitrile in 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid. The chromatographic separation was performed by a gradient elution as follows (solvent A was water and solvent B was acetonitrile, both containing 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid): 0–10 min, linear gradient to 40% B; 10–40 min, 40% B; 40–41 min, linear gradient to 100% B; 41–45 min, hold; flow rate = 0.8 ml/min. The isolation and purification of the antigenic adducts (P-1 and P-2) were carried out under the same HPLC conditions and finally obtained 2.3 and 2.9 mg of P-1 and P-2, respectively. Their structures were characterized by LC/MS and 1H and 13C NMR. The LC/MS was measured by a Jasco PlatformII-LC instrument. The LC/MS analysis was performed using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm) eluted with a linear gradient from 100% water containing 0.1% acetic acid to 100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid for 60 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 239 nm. The NMR analyses were performed using a Bruker AMX400 (400 MHz) instrument. For P-1, 1H NMR (400 MHz, MeOD): δ 0.85–0.92 (6H, m), 1.25–1.50 (22H, m), 1.66 (2H, m), 1.70–2.08 (7H, m), 2.13 (2H, q), 2.87 (2H, t), 4.36 (1H, q), 4.55 (2H, t), 6.16 (1H, m), 6.51 (1H, d, J = 11.6 Hz), 7.93 (1H, d, J = 6.4 Hz), 8.66 (1H, s), and 8.70 (1H, d, J = 5.4 Hz). For P-2, 1H NMR (MeOD, 600 MHz): δ 0.89–0.94 (6H, m), 1.30–1.52 (11H, m), 1.40–1.52 (2H, m), 1.56 (2H, m), 1.66 (2H, m), 1.70–1.92 (2H, m), 1.96 (3H, s), 2.01–2.06 (2H, m), 2.36 (2H, q), 2.93 (2H, t), 4.39 (1H, q), 4.53 (2H, q), 6.54 (1H, m), 6.66 (1H, d, J = 16.2 Hz), 7.84 (1H, d, J = 6.0 Hz), 8.61 (1H, d, J = 6.0 Hz), 8.91 (1H, s); 13C NMR (150 MHz, MeOD): δ 14.3 (2C), 22.4, 23.4, 23.5 (2C), 29.5, 30.0, 30.2, 31.6, 32.1, 32.5, 32.6, 34.0, 34.2, 53.0, 62.0, 122.4, 129.2, 139.4, 142.2 (2C), 142.5, 160.7, 173.3, and 175.1. Male Wistar rats (Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center, Shizuoka, Japan), weighing 130–150 g (6 weeks old), were used. The animals received a single intraperitoneal injection of Fe3+-NTA (15 mg of iron/kg of body weight) or repeated administration as described previously (5Toyokuni S. Luo X.P. Tanaka T. Uchida K. Hiai H. Lehotay D.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). They were sacrificed by decapitation at 0, 1, 6, 24, and 48 h after a single injection or 3 weeks after the repeated administration. Both kidneys of each animal were immediately removed. One of them was fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin, cut in 3-mm thick slices, and used for the immunohistochemical analyses by an avidin-biotin complex method with alkaline phosphatase. Briefly, after deparaffinization with xylene and ethanol, normal rabbit serum (Dako; diluted to 1:75) for the inhibition of the nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody, a primary antibody (20 μg/ml), biotin-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG serum (Vector Laboratories; diluted to 1:300), and avidin-biotin complex (Vector; diluted to 1:100) were sequentially used. Procedures, using PBS or the IgG fraction (0.5 mg/ml) of the normal mouse serum instead of mAb 27Q4, showed no response or negligible positive responses. To prepare the [U-13C6,15N2]HHP-lysine, 1 mm Nα-[U-13C6,15N2]Fmoc-Nϵ-Boc-lysine was treated with 1 ml of trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at room temperature, applied to a C-18 Sep-Pak column, and eluted with 5 ml of methanol. The eluate was evaporated and redissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The obtained Nα-[U-13C6,15N2]Fmoc-lysine was modified with 1 mm 2-nonenal for 24 h at 37 °C and subsequently treated with 20% piperidine for 2 h at room temperature to remove the Fmoc moiety. The resulting mixture was purified by HPLC, carried out under the same HPLC conditions as already described. LC/ESI/MS/MS analysis with MRM mode of the isotope-labeled HPH-lysines showed that that the standards contained no endogenous (nonlabeled) adducts (supplemental Fig. S1). Mass spectrometric analyzes were performed using a Quattro Ultima triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters-Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with an ESI probe and interfaced with a Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The sample injection volumes of 20 μl each were separated on a Shim-pack VP-ODS 2.0 × 150 mm, 5-μm column (Shimadzu) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. A discontinuous gradient was used by solvent A (H2O containing 0.1% formic acid) with solvent B (acetonitrile) as follows: isocratic elution with 20% solvent B from 0 to 5 min; increasing to 50% solvent B from 5 to 20 min; increasing to 70% solvent B from 20 to 25 min; and then isocratic elution with 70% solvent B from 25 to 30 min. Mass spectrometric analyzes were performed on line using ESI/MS/MS in the positive ion mode with MRM mode (cone potential 35 eV/collision energy 24 eV). The MRM transitions monitored were as follows: [U-13C6,15N2]HHP-lysine, m/z 397 → 261; cis- and trans-HHP-lysine, m/z 389 → 260. l-Glutamate upon reaction with 2-nonenal gave similar MRM transitions but MRM transitions (360 → 260) were detected in the reaction mixture of 2-nonenal/glutamate; however, their elution times were completely different from those of standard HHP-lysines (supplemental Fig. S2). The amount of each HHP-lysine adduct was quantified by the ratio of the peak area of the target adducts and of the HHP-lysine-stable isotope. The HHP-lysine standard concentration was determined by assay of the amino groups using a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid assay (16Habeeb A.F. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 14: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). Briefly, to 30 μl of hydrolyzed HHP-lysine solution was added 30 μl of 4% NaHCO3 and 30 μl of 0.1% 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. The solution was allowed to react at 37 °C for 2 h, and 30 μl of 1% SDS and 15 μl of 1 n HCl were then added. The absorbance of the solution was read at 340 nm. The standard curve (using valine as a standard) was linear in the range 0–3.3 nmol of NH2. QuanLynx (version 4.0) software (Waters-Micromass) was used to create standard curves (supplemental Fig. S3) and to calculate the adduct concentrations. For the LC/ESI/MS/MS analysis of the HHP-lysines in vitro, the protein samples were treated with an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the proteins were hydrolyzed in vacuo with 2 ml of 6 n HCl for 24 h at 110 °C. The internal standard, [U-13C6,15N2]HHP-lysine, was added to the samples prior to the acid hydrolysis. After the acid hydrolysis, the samples were partially separated with Oasis hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA). After the sample loading, the HLB cartridges were washed with 2 ml of 50% methanol, and the HHP-lysines were eluted with 2 ml of 80% methanol. The samples were then dried, dissolved in methanol, and subjected to LC/ESI/MS/MS analysis. For the LC/ESI/MS/MS analyses of the HHP-lysines in vivo, male ddY mice (Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center, Shizuoka), weighing 25–35 g (6 weeks of age), were used. Animals received a single intraperitoneal injection of Fe3+-NTA (5 mg of iron/kg of body weight). They were sacrificed at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after the administration. Both kidneys of each animal were immediately removed. The kidneys were homogenized in a Teflon homogenizer in 10 volumes of PBS containing butylated hydroxytoluene (1 mm). The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min, and the precipitates were hydrolyzed in vacuo with 6 n HCl (2 ml) and [U-13C6,15N2]HHP-lysine for 24 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysates were then dried and dissolved in methanol. After the acid hydrolysis, the samples were partially separated with HLB cartridges and subjected to LC/ESI/MS/MS analysis. DiD (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate)-labeled AcLDL was prepared from human LDL according to the methods previously described for 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3, 3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate labeling (17Stephan Z.F. Yurachek E.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 325-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells that stably expressed CFP-tagged LOX-1 (18Matsunaga S. Xie Q. Kumano M. Niimi S. Sekizawa K. Sakakibara Y. Komba S. Machida S. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 1203-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were grown on coverslips. For the cells transiently expressing CFP, CHO cells suspended at a density of 1 × 104 cells/ml were plated on a coverslip 24 h prior to transfection. The cells (40% confluent) were transfected with pECFP-N1 (Clontech) using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol and then incubated for 48 h. Cells were treated with each concentration of adducts prepared in F-12 medium without fetal calf serum for 10 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, followed by incubation with DiD-AcLDL (0.4 μg/coverslip) for another 15 min. The cells were then fixed with 2% formaldehyde. Each coverslip was inverted onto a glass slide with a spacer, and the cells were examined using a Leica DM IRE2 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzler, Germany) equipped with a ×100, NA 1.4 objective and a Cool SNAP-HG digitalized cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) driven by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). The expression level of LOX-1 was examined by the CFP fluorescence intensity using an E4 filter with excitation at 436 nm (7-nm bandpass) and a 470-nm long pass emission filter. Images were acquired at 0.2 s exposure time. The DiD-AcLDL uptake was analyzed by the amount of the DiD-derived fluorescence intensity using a Y5 filter, with excitation using a 620 nm (50-nm bandpass) and 700 nm (75-nm bandpass) emission filters. The images were acquired at a 2-s exposure. Images of over 100 cells from three independent experiments were acquired. After subtracting the background emission level with respect to 436 and 620 nm from the fluorescence image, the fluorescence intensity of each cell was determined from the average pixel value of the whole cell. The expression level of LOX-1 was calculated from the CFP intensity, and the level of uptake of AcLDL was calculated from the DiD intensity (18Matsunaga S. Xie Q. Kumano M. Niimi S. Sekizawa K. Sakakibara Y. Komba S. Machida S. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 1203-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For each experimental condition, the level of AcLDL uptake was averaged per expression level of LOX-1. To assess the reactivity of 2-nonenal to proteins, HSA (1 mg/ml) was exposed to 2-nonenal (0–10 mm) under physiological conditions in vitro, and changes in the amino acid composition of the protein were examined by an amino acid analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, 2-nonenal preferentially reacted with the lysine residues, indicating that 2-nonenal can covalently modify protein spontaneously, and the likely mechanism is a nucleophilic attack by the protein. To determine whether modification of proteins by 2-nonenal occurs in vivo, we attempted to develop a mAb against 2-nonenal-modified protein. To this end, the keyhole limpet hemocyanin that had been exposed to 2-nonenal was administered to mice at 10-day intervals. During the preparation of the mAb, hybridomas were selected by comparing the reactivities of the culture supernatant to the 2-nonenal-modified BSA. Among the four obtained clones, the clone 27Q4 showed the most distinctive recognition of the 2-nonenal-modified BSA. The specificity of the obtained antibody was characterized. As shown in Fig. 1C, the monoclonal antibody showed a strong immunoreactivity not only with 2-nonenal but also with 2-octenal and 2-heptenal, whereas the unmodified BSA was not recognized by the antibody.

The activities lost by W26A-HNP1 were restored progressively by replacing W26 with non-coded, straight-chain aliphatic amino acids of increasing chain length. The hydrophobicity of residue 26 also correlated with the ability of the analogs to bind immobilized wild type HNP1 and to undergo further self-association. Thus, the hydrophobicity of residue 26 is not only a key determinant of the direct interactions of HNP1 with target molecules, but it also governs the ability of this peptide to form dimers and more complex quaternary structures at micromolar concentrations.

https://openalex.org/W2070407927,"FeoB is a prokaryotic membrane protein responsible for the import of ferrous iron (Fe2+). A defining feature of FeoB is that it includes an N-terminal 30-kDa soluble domain with GTPase activity, which is required for iron transport. However, the low intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of this domain appears to be too slow for FeoB either to function as a channel or to possess an active Fe2+ membrane transport mechanism. Here, we present crystal structures of the soluble domain of FeoB from Streptococcus thermophilus in complex with GDP and with the GTP analogue derivative 2′-(or -3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-β,γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate (mant-GMPPNP). Unlike recent structures of the G protein domain, the mant-GMPPNP-bound structure shows clearly resolved, active conformations of the critical Switch motifs. Importantly, biochemical analyses demonstrate that the GTPase activity of FeoB is activated by K+, which leads to a 20-fold acceleration in its hydrolysis rate. Analysis of the structure identified a conserved asparagine residue likely to be involved in K+ coordination, and mutation of this residue abolished K+-dependent activation. We suggest that this, together with a second asparagine residue that we show is critical for the structure of the Switch I loop, allows the prediction of K+-dependent activation in G proteins.

In addition, the accelerated hydrolysis rate opens up the possibility that FeoB might indeed function as an active transporter. Small regulatory GTPase proteins (G proteins) are key binary switches in cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and cell motility (1Cachero T.G. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G.

As such, their aberrant functions result in a number of pathophysiological disorders, such as asthma and cancer (3Schaafsma D. Roscioni S.S. Meurs H. Schmidt M.

G proteins cycle between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state. When bound to GTP, they interact with effector proteins through active conformations of certain polypeptide segments designated Switch I and Switch II (5Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). The active GTP-bound conformations of the Switch segments are stabilized by their interactions with the nucleotide γ-phosphate and a Mg2+ ion at the nucleotide-binding site. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP releases the γ-phosphate and the Mg2+ ion, leading to the relaxation of the Switch I and II segments to their inactive conformations (5Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). The prokaryotic G protein-coupled ferrous iron (Fe2+) transporter B (FeoB) is unique in that its cytoplasmic G protein domain is directly tethered to a polytopic membrane domain (6Marlovits T.C. Haase W. Herrmann C. Aller S.G. Unger V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16243-16248Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The G protein domain belongs to the TrmE-Era-EngA-YihA-Septin-like (TEES) 4The abbreviations used are: TEESTrmE-Era-EngA-YihA-Septin-likeGAPGTPase-activating proteinmant-GMPPNP2′-(or -3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-β,γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate. superfamily of bacterial GTPases, which are recognized by sequence conservation between the G1 and G2 motifs.

GTP binding to the G protein domain (FeoGP) initiates the transport of Fe2+ across the membrane, which is halted by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Previous studies have shown that FeoGP has slow GTPase activity (Escherichia coli kcat = 0.0015 s−1, equivalent to the hydrolysis of one GTP molecule in 11 min) (6Marlovits T.C. Haase W. Herrmann C.

EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2677-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A slow intrinsic GTPase rate is not uncommon for G proteins, because their activity can be accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which can stimulate GTP hydrolysis by several orders of magnitude (10Bos J.L. Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2007; 129: 865-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). One mode of activation by many GAPs is through the insertion of an arginine residue (arginine finger) into the active site of the G protein, which neutralizes the developing negative charge on the nucleotide during hydrolysis (11Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Nurmahomed K. Owen D. Laue E. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 1997; 388: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 12Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W.

Such GAPs are an essential aspect of the function and regulation of G protein-coupled processes, yet despite extensive efforts, no such GAP or other activating factor has been identified for FeoB. The slow intrinsic hydrolysis rate of FeoB has thus remained somewhat puzzling, being too slow to support an active Fe2+ transport mechanism (8Eng E.T. Jalilian A.R. Spasov K.A. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 1086-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Yet should it rather function as a G protein-coupled channel, the channel would remain in an “open” state for an unfeasible period of time after GTP binding.

To gain further insight into the mechanism of FeoB, we and other groups have recently structurally characterized the soluble G protein domain from four different organisms: E. coli, Methanococcus jannaschii, Thermotoga maritima, and Legionella pneumophilia (9Guilfoyle A. Maher M.J. Rapp M. Clarke R. Harrop S. Jormakka M. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2677-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Hattori M. Jin Y. Nishimasu H. Tanaka Y. Mochizuki M. Uchiumi T.

The structures revealed a canonical G protein similar to Ras, followed by a helical domain with a proposed effector (9Guilfoyle A. Maher M.J. Rapp M. Clarke R. Harrop S. Jormakka M.

However, in all FeoB structures of the G protein complexed with GTP analogues, the crucial Switch I loop was either disordered (9Guilfoyle A. Maher M.J. Rapp M. Clarke R. Harrop S. Jormakka M. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2677-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Köster S. Wehner M. Herrmann C. Kühlbrandt W. Yildiz O. J. Mol.

Ito K. Nureki O. Structure. 2009; 17: 1345-1355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This indicated that the Switch I region was not essential for nucleotide or Mg2+ binding, consistent with mutational analysis of conserved residues in Switch I of E. coli FeoB, which did not significantly affect its GTPase activity (8Eng E.T. Jalilian A.R. Spasov K.A. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 1086-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Conversely, studies upon full-length FeoB harboring the same mutations in Switch I were unable to restore Fe2+ uptake in a feoB-deficient background (6Marlovits T.C. Haase W. Herrmann C. Aller S.G. Unger V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16243-16248Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This apparent disparity has left the role played by the Switch I region in FeoB open. To probe the function of Switch I in FeoB and to extend the current structural information, we have determined the structure of the 30-kDa soluble domain of FeoB from Streptococcus thermophilus (NFeoBSt, residues 1–270) complexed with GDP and with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue (5′[β,γ-imido]triposphate) derivative, mant-GMPPNP. The latter structure reveals an ordered Switch I motif in the canonical, active conformation, in which the loop hydrogen bonds with the nucleotide γ-phosphate and coordinates the Mg2+ ion. Hydrolysis measurements conducted in the presence of K+ show FeoB to be a potassium-activated G protein, with the cation increasing the rate of GTP hydrolysis by up to 20-fold. Furthermore, from structural comparison and mutational analysis, we propose that two conserved asparagine residues (Asn11 and Asn19) facilitate the activation by potassium and that these residues confer the general characteristic of potassium-dependent activation in the TEES superfamily of G proteins. DNA encoding residues 1–270 from FeoB was amplified from S. thermophilus genomic DNA (strain LMG 18311) and cloned into a pGEX-4T-1 glutathione S-transferase fusion vector (GE Healthcare). NFeoBSt was expressed and purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as described for E. coli NFeoB (9Guilfoyle A. Maher M.J. Rapp M. Clarke R. Harrop S. Jormakka M. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2677-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, NFeoBSt was purified by glutathione S-transferase affinity chromatography in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. Thrombin cleavage to remove the glutathione S-transferase tag was performed for 24 h at 25 °C. NFeoBSt was then applied to a Superdex 75 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), and the eluted protein concentrated to ∼12 mg/ml as determined by the BCA assay method. The concentrated protein was stored at −80 °C until further use. The plasmid pGEX-4T1/NFeoBSt was used to generate an expression vector with a single amino acid mutation (N11A) by using a Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mutant was expressed and purified as for the wild-type protein, with the addition of 5% glycerol in all purification buffers. For crystallization of mant-GMPPNP-bound NFeoBSt, protein (7 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 0.5 mm mant-GMPPNP. GDP-bound NFeoBSt was crystallized from a solution containing protein (3 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl), which was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.2 mm GDP, 2 mm NaF, and 0.2 mm AlCl3. Crystallization conditions were screened at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with Qiagen JCSG+ and PACT screens. All crystallization drops were set up in 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) using a Mosquito nanolitre liquid handling robot (Molecular Dimensions) and contained equal volumes of reservoir solution (150 nl) and protein solution. For mant-GMPPNP-bound NFeoBSt, a large crystal plate appeared after 1 week in PACT screen condition D5 (0.1 m MMT buffer, pH 8.0, 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500), which had the approximate dimensions 350 × 100 × 20 μm. GDP-bound NFeoBSt crystallized after 3 days in the JCSG+ condition H8 (0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m bis-Tris, pH 5.5, 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350). The crystal had the approximate dimensions 100 × 100 × 10 μm. Single crystals were flash frozen directly into a cold N2 gas stream (100 K) using 20% (v/v) glycerol in reservoir solution as cryoprotectant. Diffraction data for each crystal were recorded on a Mar345 image plate detector using copper Kα X-rays from either a Rigaku RU-200 (mant-GMPPNP-bound NFeoBSt), or a Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF (GDP-bound NFeoBSt) rotating anode generator. The data were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Charles W. Carter J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). The structure of NFeoBSt complexed with mant-GMPPNP was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the G domain of E. coli NFeoB as a search model (Protein Data Bank accession code 3HYR, residues 1–168). The waters were removed prior to molecular replacement, and all of the selenomethionine residues were mutated to methionine. CHAINSAW (17Stein N. J. Appl. Cryst. 2008; 41: 641-643Crossref Scopus (451) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 program suite (18Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar) was used to truncate nonconserved side chains to the gamma atom. Molecular replacement was performed using the program PHASER (19McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14552) Google Scholar), using diffraction data to 2.5 Å. The G domain was unambiguously positioned with a single unique solution, which had a log likelihood gain of 84 and a Z-score of 7.4. Molecular replacement was then attempted using the helical domain of E. coli FeoB (residues 171–260); however, no clear solution could be found. Refinement thus commenced with the G domain only, which represented ∼60% of the NFeoBSt structure. Refinement of all structures was carried out using REFMAC5.5 (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A.

After several rounds of refinement of mant-GMPPNP-bound NFeoBSt, the electron density was of sufficient quality to manually position the C-terminal helix of the helical domain (residues 242–259), and iterative rounds of manual building and refinement produced a model of 199 residues. Model phases were then input into ARP/warp (23Cohen S.X. Morris R.J. Fernandez F.J. Ben Jelloul M. Kakaris M. Parthasarathy V. Lamzin V.S. Kleywegt G.J. Perrakis A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which built a further 59 residues. The final model contains protein residues 2–161 and 167–265. The structure of GDP-bound NFeoBSt was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER, with the coordinates of mant-GMPPNP-bound NFeoBSt as a search model. Molecular replacement identified a single solution with a log likelihood gain of 174 and a Z-score of 16.5. The final model consists of protein residues 1–258. A Malachite Green phosphate assay kit (BioAssay Systems) was used to measure the GTPase activity of wild-type and mutant NFeoBSt in the presence of various monovalent cations. NFeoBSt (0.3 μm) was incubated with 250 μm GTP and 5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and 100 or 200 mm salt (either LiCl, NaCl, KCl, NH4Cl, RbCl, or CsCl). After the addition of protein, aliquots were removed at frequent intervals for up to 3 h and mixed in a 1:4 ratio with the Malachite Green reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each aliquot, color was allowed to develop for 30 min at room temperature before measuring the absorbance at 620 nm in a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One) on a POLARstar Omega microplate reader (BMG LABTECH). The turnover number (kcat), was calculated from the slope of each time course. All of the hydrolysis assays were performed in triplicate. The rate of GTP hydrolysis by wild-type and mutant NFeoBSt in NaCl and KCl were determined by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in single-turnover experiments. All of the experiments contained 70 μm NFeoBSt and 30 μm GTP and were conducted on a POLARstar Omega microplate reader (BMG LABTECH) in black flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One). A 280 ± 5-nm filter was used for excitation, and fluorescence was measured using a 355 ± 5-nm emission filter. NFeoBSt was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and either NaCl (100 or 200 mm) or KCl (50–200 mm). This solution was used to set the relative gain of the plate reader, which was adjusted to give a fluorescence signal of 90% of the maximum possible value. GTP was then added to the mixture, and the fluorescence was monitored for 1 min. The GTPase reaction was initiated with the addition of 1 mm MgCl2 using the POLARstar reagent injection apparatus. After the addition of MgCl2, hydrolysis was monitored every 5 s for 4 min or every 20 s for 30 min for reactions performed in KCl and NaCl, respectively. The data were fit to a single-exponential association function using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), where the rate constant is equal to kcat. Because of the presence of a 60-s lag phase in the NaCl reactions, these data were excluded in the calculation of kcat in NaCl. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was also used to determine the binding affinity of wild-type and mutant NFeoBSt for GTP. Different concentrations of GTP (0.02–0.8 mm) were added to protein (15 μm) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, with either 100 mm NaCl or 100 mm KCl at 23 °C. The gain of each sample in the POLARstar plate reader was adjusted to give a signal of 90% of the maximum value. The fluorescence was monitored every 10 s for 1 min, after which time nucleotide binding was initiated by the addition of 3 mm MgCl2 using the POLARstar reagent injectors. For wild-type measurements conducted in NaCl and for mutant measurements, the slow rate of nucleotide hydrolysis precluded any hydrolysis-related increase in fluorescence on the time scale of the experiment. Therefore, the fluorescence of the samples after MgCl2 addition was recorded every 10 s for a further minute, and the steady-state fluorescence values (both before and after nucleotide binding) were individually averaged. The relative change in fluorescence for each nucleotide concentration was used to plot a binding isotherm. For wild-type measurements in the presence of KCl, the data were collected every 5 s for 3 min after the addition of MgCl2. At lower nucleotide concentrations, rapid hydrolysis caused a significant increase in fluorescence after MgCl2 addition. Therefore, the data were fit to an exponential association function, and the calculated fluorescence at 0 s was used to determine the change in fluorescence upon nucleotide binding. Binding curves were fit to a rectangular hyperbola using GraphPad Prism 5.0, and all of the experiments were performed in triplicate. The rates of mant-GMPPNP and mant-GTP binding to mutant and wild-type NFeoBSt were measured using a stopped flow apparatus (SF-61; Hi-Tech Scientific Ltd., Salisbury, UK) as previously described (6Marlovits T.C.

Briefly, protein (10 μm in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm MgCl2, and either 100 mm NaCl or KCl) was rapidly mixed with 500 μm mant-GMPPNP or mant-GTP (in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 100 mm of the corresponding salt). To measure the rate of mant-GDP release, protein (10 μm in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and either 100 mm NaCl or KCl) was incubated for 10 min with 0.5 μm mant-GDP and then rapidly mixed with 500 μm GTP in the corresponding buffer. All of the measurements were conducted at 25 °C. The mant fluorophore was excited at 355 nm using a mercury lamp (Osram, Berlin, Germany), and the fluorescence was collected at wavelengths of ≥400 nm using a GG400 glass cut-off filter (Schott, Mainz, Germany). All of the experiments were performed 7–10 times, and the data were averaged before calculating the final kobs or koff values. NFeoBSt (residues 1–270) co-crystallized with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue mant-GMPPNP in space group C2221, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The crystal diffracted to 1.9 Å, and refinement converged with residuals Rwork = 0.197 and Rfree = 0.241. The final model contains residues 2–161 and 167–265, a mant-GMPPNP molecule, a Mg2+ ion, and a glycerol molecule. The mant group from the nucleotide is disordered in the structure and makes no contacts with the protein (supplemental Fig. S1). The GDP-bound form of NFeoBSt crystallized in space group P41212, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined and refined to 2.9-Å resolution with Rwork = 0.239 and Rfree = 0.298. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited under Protein Data Bank codes 3LX5 and 3LX8 for the mant-GMPPNP- and GDP-bound forms, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Both structures of NFeoBSt show the G protein domain (residues 1–170) followed by the helical domain (residues 171–270) (Fig. 1B). The GTPase domain forms the archetypical G protein fold, which consists of a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices. The helical domain is composed of a five-helix bundle (h1–h5), which contacts the G domain via helices h2, h3, and h5. Previous structures of the soluble domain of FeoB have indicated putative biological dimer (13Hattori M. Jin Y. Nishimasu H. Tanaka Y. Mochizuki M. Uchiumi T. Ishitani R. Ito K. Nureki O.

EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2677-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) configurations, whereas gel filtration indicates NFeoBSt is monomeric in solution. In the crystal of mant-GMPPNP-bound NFeoBSt, a symmetric dimer (generated by symmetry operation −x, y, −z + 1/2) lies across a crystallographic 2-fold axis. The dimer interface is formed from the Switch I loop, yet its low total buried surface area (409 Å2/protomer) suggests that it is most likely a product of crystal packing (24Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). For GDP-bound NFeoBSt, there are likewise no significant contacts within the crystal that are suggestive of any biologically relevant higher order oligomer, with the largest buried interface area being 376 Å2/protomer. GDP-bound NFeoBSt was crystallized from a solution containing the components necessary for formation of the transition-state analogue of GTP (25Bigay J. Deterre P. Pfister C. Chabre M. FEBS Lett. 1985; 191: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Despite intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence indicating that the transition state was successfully formed in solution (supplemental Fig. S2), the resultant crystals contained only GDP-bound protein. The GDP molecule is contacted by a number of residues at the nucleotide-binding site, including Asn113, Asn116, Ser16, and the backbone amides of Asn11–Gly13. The Switch I loop (residues 24–36) does not interact with the GDP and is instead oriented away from the nucleotide-binding site in its inactive conformation. The loop forms an additional anti-parallel β-strand against the β-sheet core of the protein (Fig. 1B), as has been observed for the GDP-bound forms of NFeoB from other organisms (13Hattori M. Jin Y.

Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 374: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (27Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), where the additional β-strand in Switch I has also been observed, we refer to this strand as β2E. The core structures of GDP-NFeoBSt and mant-GMPPNP-NFeoBSt are highly similar, and superposition of the two structures, excluding the Switch regions, gives a root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å in 218 Cα positions. However, three principal regions have undergone structural rearrangement between the two forms: the Switch I motif, the Switch II motif, and the helical domain. The most dramatic of these changes is in Switch I, where the β2E strand has been broken and the loop has been shifted almost 30 Å toward the nucleotide-binding site (Fig. 1B). Now in its GTP-bound orientation, Switch I forms a lid over the nucleotide, the apex of which is comprised of residues 29–33. This lid leaves the nucleotide base and ribose solvent-exposed yet completely buries all three of its phosphate groups (supplemental Fig. S3). There is a distinctive bend in the Switch I backbone near residue 26, which lies at the base of the loop. This bend is caused by two hydrogen bonds between both side chain groups of a conserved asparagine residue, Asn19, and the backbone amide and carbonyl groups of Asn26 from the Switch I"

Previously, we found that MIF was significantly elevated in multiple long-lived mouse models, including calorie restriction (CR), which led us to hypothesize that MIF might be important in the control of mammalian life span and be necessary for the life-extending effects of CR. To test this hypothesis, we examined the life span of mice with a targeted deletion of the Mif gene on a segregating B6 × 129/Sv background (MIF-KO) under ad libitum (AL) feeding and CR conditions. Control mice were generated by mating C57BL/6J females with 129/SvJ males to make an F1 hybrid, and crossing F1 males to F1 females to produce segregating F2 mice homozygous for the normal MIF allele. Not only did MIF-KO mice show a life span extension in response to CR, they were, unexpectedly, longer lived than controls under standard AL conditions. MIF-KO mice were significantly protected against lethal hemangiosarcoma, but more likely than controls to die of disseminated amyloid, an age-related inflammatory syndrome. Overall, these data refute the suggestion that MIF is required for the CR effect on life span, but raise the possibility that MIF may limit life span in normal mice.—Harper, J. M., Wilkinson, J.

https://openalex.org/W1998120603,"Decrease in fat catabolic rate on consuming a high-fat diet contributes to diet-induced obesity. This study used group 1B phospholipase A2 (Pla2g1b)-deficient mice, which are resistant to hyperglycemia, to test the hypothesis that Pla2g1b and its lipolytic product lysophospholipid suppress hepatic fat utilization and energy metabolism in promoting dietinduced obesity. The metabolic consequences of hypercaloric diet, including body weight gain, energy expenditure, and fatty acid oxidation, were compared between Pla2g1b+/+ and Pla2g1b−/− mice. The Pla2g1b−/− mice displayed normal energy balance when fed chow, but were resistant to obesity when challenged with a hypercaloric diet. Obesity resistance in Pla2g1b mice is due to their ability to maintain elevated energy expenditure and core body temperature when subjected to hypercaloric diet, which was not observed in Pla2g1b+/+ mice. The Pla2g1b mice also displayed increased postprandial hepatic fat utilization due to increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, PPAR-δ, PPAR-γ, cd36/Fat, and Ucp2, which coincided with reduced postprandial plasma lysophospholipid levels. Lysophospholipids produced by Pla2g1b hydrolysis suppress hepatic fat utilization and down-regulate energy expenditure, thereby preventing metabolically beneficial adaptation to a high-fat diet exposure in promoting diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes.—Labonté, E.

Both spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) aortas and SHR-derived VSMCs exhibited reduced PPAR-γ expression and excessive VSMC phenotypic modulation identified by reduced contractile proteins, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and smooth muscle 22α (SM22α), and enhanced proliferation and migration.

Naiki T. J. Mech. Behav. Biomed. Mater. 2009; 2: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Unlike other muscle cells, VSMCs do not terminally differentiate. They can switch from a differentiated phenotype (also known as contractile or quiescent phenotype) to a dedifferentiated phenotype (also known as synthetic or activated phenotype) in response to vascular injury. In this process, VSMCs regain their proliferative and migratory capacities, secrete matrix proteins, and down-regulate smooth muscle contractile proteins, such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), smooth muscle 22α (SM22α), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, and calponin (2Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2535) Google Scholar). Although this phenotypic modulation is undoubtedly required for vascular repair, inappropriate modulation is associated with increased vascular resistance and aggravates vascular injury. However, despite intensive research efforts, the precise mechanisms underlying VSMC phenotypic modulation during hypertension remain unclear.The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ is a ligand-activated transcription factor (3Kliewer S.A. Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 239-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). It regulates various genes involved in glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and adipocyte differentiation via binding to the PPAR response elements in target genes, and therefore participates in modulation of several diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis (4Marx N. Duez H. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1168-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 5Hsueh W.A. Bruemmer D. Hypertension. 2004; 43: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Convincing evidence indicates the role of PPAR-γ in hypertension. For example, individuals with a dominant-negative PPAR-γ mutation present with early onset hypertension and elements of metabolic syndrome (6Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 1999; 402: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar).PPAR-γ is expressed in VSMCs in vivo and in vitro (7Law R.E. Goetze S. Xi X.P. Jackson S. Kawano Y. Demer L. Fishbein M.C.

In spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR)-derived VSMCs, PPAR-γ overexpression or treatment with the PPAR-γ agonist thiazolidinedione retards VSMC growth to the level of non-hypertensive rat VSMCs (8Xiong C.

In addition, PPAR-γ inhibits the VSMC proliferation induced by platelet-derived growth factor and angiotensin II (7Law R.E. Goetze S. Xi X.P. Jackson S. Kawano Y. Demer L. Fishbein M.C. Meehan W.P.

Lazar M.A. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Considering that phenotypic modulation is a prerequisite for VSMCs to regain the proliferative and migratory capacity (14Sung H.J. Eskin S.G. Sakurai Y. Yee A. Kataoka N. McIntire L.V. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2005; 33: 1546-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we postulate that PPAR-γ can negatively regulate the phenotypic modulation of VSMCs.Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular growth, apoptosis, and metabolism (15Kondapaka S.B.

Activated PI3K phosphorylates Akt and induces the expression of transcriptional factors involved in multiple processes. The PI3K/Akt signaling is reportedly required for VSMC migration and proliferation, absence of Akt impairs VSMC proliferation and migration (17Fernández-Hernando C. József L. Jenkins D. Di Lorenzo A. Sessa W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A previous study (18Goetze S. Eilers F. Bungenstock A. Kintscher U. Stawowy P. Blaschke F. Graf K. Law R.E. Fleck E. Gräfe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) indicated the link between PI3K/Akt signaling and PPAR-γ. PPAR-γ activation can inhibit the Akt phosphorylation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor in endothelial cells (18Goetze S. Eilers F. Bungenstock A. Kintscher U. Stawowy P. Blaschke F. Graf K. Law R.E. Fleck E. Gräfe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, neither the role of PPAR-γ and PI3K/Akt signaling nor their exact interaction in VSMC phenotypic modulation during hypertension is fully understood. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that PPAR-γ plays an important role in inhibiting VSMC phenotypic modulation through negatively regulating the activity of PI3K/Akt signaling and thus participates in VSMC phenotypic modulation during hypertension.DISCUSSIONHere we found that during hypertension, VSMCs exhibit impaired PPAR-γ expression, which is related to excessive phenotypic modulation. PPAR-γ overexpression can inhibit the phenotypic modulation by rescuing the contractile proteins and inhibiting proliferation and migration in SHR-derived VSMCs. Activation of PPAR-γ with rosiglitazone can ameliorate the hypertension-induced aortic remodeling. PI3K/Akt signaling is negatively modulated by PPAR-γ. Impaired PPAR-γ expression in VSMCs accounts for enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling activity, and contributes to the excessive phenotypic modulation during hypertension.Hypertension can significantly impact the vascular system. VSMCs are susceptible to hypertensive stress, and undergo phenotypic switch from contractile to synthetic phenotype. Reportedly, SHR-derived VSMCs display an exaggerated growth rate, abnormal contact inhibition, and accelerated entry into the cell cycle S phase (8Xiong C. Mou Y. Zhang J. Fu M. Chen Y.E. Akinbami M.A. Cui T. Life Sci. 2005; 77: 3037-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed impaired α-SMA and SM22α expression, and enhanced proliferative and migratory capacity in SHR-derived VSMCs, which indicated the VSMC phenotypic modulation during hypertension. Although even normal cultured VSMCs are reported to undergo phenotypic changes by expressing fewer contractile markers and more synthetic phenotype (30Sobue K. Hayashi K. Nishida W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 105-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we indeed revealed more obvious phenotypic changes in SHR-derived VSMCs than in WKY-derived VSMCs, which indicated the excessive VSMC phenotypic modulation in hypertension.Activated VSMCs contribute to thickened vessel wall and vascular remodeling through accumulation in intima and medium (1Hayashi K. Naiki T. J. Mech. Behav. Biomed. Mater. 2009; 2: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 31Wang Z. Rao P.J. Shillcutt S.D. Newman W.H. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 373: 38-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As expected, we observed aortic hypertrophic remodeling during hypertension, characterized by intima-media thickening and lumen loss. This finding confirmed the involvement of VSMC phenotypic modulation in hypertension-induced vascular remodeling.It is well established that PPAR-γ participates in the modulation of multiple diseases including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and hypertension, and plays a critical role in VSMC viability (6Barroso I.

Here we hypothesize that PPAR-γ participates in the regulation of VSMC phenotypic modulation, and therefore is associated with increased VSMC phenotypic modulation during hypertension. There are controversies surrounding the specifics of PPAR-γ expression during hypertension. Diep and Schiffrin (25Diep Q.N. Schiffrin E.L. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported higher PPAR-γ levels in SHR mesenteric arteries compared with WKYs, but no difference between SHR and WKY aortas. In contrast, Xiong et al. (8Xiong C. Mou Y. Zhang J. Fu M. Chen Y.E. Akinbami M.A. Cui T. Life Sci. 2005; 77: 3037-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) observed reduced PPAR-γ protein levels in the SHR aorta, mesenteric arteries, and SHR-derived VSMCs, despite a high mRNA level. The explanation for these conflicting results is unclear. Given that Diep and Schiffrin (25Diep Q.N. Schiffrin E.L. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) detected PPAR-γ protein in whole vessels instead of VSMCs, the results might not reflect the exact level of PPAR-γ in VSMCs. In the present study, we observed a significant reduction in PPAR-γ expression in the SHR aorta and SHR-derived VSMCs compared with non-hypertensive rats. We speculated that this impaired PPAR-γ expression was associated with the increased phenotypic modulation of VSMCs in hypertension.To address this, we manipulated PPAR-γ expression and evaluated the phenotypic modulation of cultured VSMCs. It was found that PPAR-γ overexpression inhibited the proliferation and migration, and rescued the impaired expression of α-SMA and SM22α in SHR-derived VSMCs, whereas PPAR-γ silencing exerted the opposite effect. Furthermore, PPAR-γ silencing in WKY-derived VSMCs led to reduced α-SMA and SM22α expression, and enhanced proliferation and migration. In vivo experiments revealed that PPAR-γ activator rosiglitazone improved the impaired expression of α-SMA and SM22α in SHR aortas. Here we provide the first evidence that PPAR-γ negatively regulates VSMC phenotypic modulation through inhibiting proliferation and migration, and preserving the contractile proteins in cultured VSMCs. The impaired PPAR-γ expression in VSMCs is, at least partly, responsible for the enhanced VSMC phenotypic modulation during hypertension, which in turn contributes to morphological vascular remodeling. As expected, up-regulating PPAR-γ expression with rosiglitazone in vivo ameliorated aortic remodeling by increasing the internal diameter and reducing IMT, which was in line with previous studies (32Ogihara T. Rakugi H. Ikegami H. Mikami H. Masuo K. Am. J. Hypertens. 1995; 8: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).Rosiglitazone treatment also reduced the SBP in SHRs, indicating its potential therapeutic effect on hypertension. It is reported that the decreased endothelin-1 level and amelioration of endothelial function are associated with the effect of rosiglitazone on blood pressure (28Potenza M.A. Marasciulo F.L. Tarquinio M. Quon M.J. Montagnani M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3594-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, due to the lack of direct manipulation of PPAR-γ expression in vivo in the present study, the exact role of PPAR-γ in rosiglitazone-mediated SBP regulation is still not clarified. Rosiglitazone did not show any effects on reducing body weight in SHRs.To explore the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of PPAR-γ on VSMCs phenotypic modulation, we tested the role of PI3K/Akt signaling in this process. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is required in multiple cellular processes, including migration and proliferation of numerous cell types (33Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton D. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 34Dimmeler S. Dernbach E. Zeiher A.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Recently, Hegner et al. (35Hegner B. Lange M. Kusch A. Essin K. Sezer O. Schulze-Lohoff E. Luft F.C. Gollasch M. Dragun D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) found that Akt phosphorylation down-regulated VSMC markers in dedifferentiated mesenchymal progenitor cells, whereas inhibition of PI3K induced the VSMC contractile phenotype, with simultaneous calponin, α-SMA, and SM22α expression. In the present study, we observed enhanced PI3K activity and phosphorylation of Akt in SHR-derived VSMCs compared with cells from WKYs. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced the capacity of proliferation and migration, and rescued the expression of α-SMA and SM22α in SHR-derived VSMCs. In contrast, the active PI3K mutant exerted the opposite effect. Moreover, the active PI3K mutant promoted a synthetic phenotype in WKY-derived VSMCs identified by impaired α-SMA and SM22α expression and elevated proliferation and migration. These findings provide the evidence that enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling is an important contributor to VSMC phenotypic modulation during hypertension.Growing evidence supports the link between PPAR-γ and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. For example, inhibition of PI3K blocks the PPAR-γ-dependent phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) 1 Ser-298, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation, and the epithelial to mesenchymal modulation (29Chen L. Necela B.M. Su W. Yanagisawa M. Anastasiadis P.Z. Fields A.P. Thompson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24575-24587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PPAR-γ ligand can markedly inhibit the enhancement of PI3K activity induced by lipopolysaccharide/interferon-γ in astrocytes (36Giri S. Rattan R. Singh A.K. Singh I. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5196-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, PPAR-γ activation inhibits Akt phosphorylation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (8Xiong C. Mou Y. Zhang J. Fu M. Chen Y.E. Akinbami M.A. Cui T. Life Sci. 2005; 77: 3037-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PI3K is required for the effects of the PPAR-γ agonist pioglitazone on H2O2-induced endothelial progenitor cell apoptosis (37Gensch C. Clever Y.P. Werner C. Hanhoun M. Böhm M. Laufs U. Atherosclerosis. 2007; 192: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Based on previous studies, we proposed that down-regulation of PI3K/Akt activity may be an important mechanism for PPAR-γ to inhibit VSMC phenotypic modulation. Our results showed that PPAR-γ overexpression reduced, whereas PPAR-γ silencing enhanced the PI3K activity and p-Akt expression in both WKY and SHR-derived VSMCs, indicating the inhibitory effect of PPAR-γ on PI3K/Akt signaling activity. We next observed the proliferation and migration in SHR-derived VSMCs with manipulation of both PPAR-γ and PI3K. Our results showed that LY294002 impeded the elevated proliferation and migration induced by PPAR-γ silencing, whereas the active PI3K mutant had the opposite effect. In contrast, reduced proliferation and migration by PPAR-γ overexpression were reversed by the active PI3K mutant, and further inhibited by LY294002. These findings indicate that PI3K/Akt signaling is inhibited by PPAR-γ, which might be an important mechanism for PPAR-γ to inhibit the VSMC phenotypic modulation. Impaired PPAR-γ in SHR-derived VSMCs is, at least partly, responsible for the elevated PI3K/Akt activity observed in hypertension, and therefore accounts for the increased VSMC modulation from contractile to synthetic phenotype.There are some limitations to our study. First, multiple mechanisms are reportedly involved in PPAR-γ-mediated regulation of VSMC action. PPAR-γ can inhibit VSMC proliferation through down-regulating inflammatory genes (38Takata Y. Kitami Y. Yang Z.H. Nakamura M. Okura T. Hiwada K. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), preventing G1/S phase transition (39Wakino S. Kintscher U. Kim S. Yin F. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22435-22441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and inhibiting telomerase activity (40Ogawa D. Nomiyama T. Nakamachi T. Heywood E.B. Stone J.F. Berger J.P. Law R.E. Bruemmer D. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: e50-e59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Obviously, the suppression of PI3K/Akt is one of these mechanisms. However, we provide convincing evidence that the suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling mediates the PPAR-γ-induced inhibition of VSMC phenotypic modulation, which indicates the important role of PI3K/Akt signaling in the effect of PPAR-γ during hypertension. Second, we realize that some effects of PPAR-γ agonists on VSMCs are PPAR-γ independent. For example, troglitazone can suppress angiotensin II-induced VSMC activation through a PPAR-γ-independent pathway (10Hattori Y. Akimoto K. Kasai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a genetic approach in vitro as a complementation of rosiglitazone to identify the effect of PPAR-γ on VSMC phenotypic modulation. Third, given that PPAR-γ can also exert a protective effect on VSMCs by improving insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, we propose that the inhibition of phenotypic modulation is one important mechanism for PPAR-γ to protect VSMCs against hypertensive injury.Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that PPAR-γ inhibits VSMC phenotypic modulation by suppressing PI3K/Akt signaling. During hypertension, impaired PPAR-γ expression in VSMCs accounts for the enhanced activity of PI3K/Akt signaling, and ultimately contributes to excessive VSMC switching from the contractile to synthetic phenotype. These novel findings provide further insight into the mechanism of VSMC phenotypic modulation during hypertension, and offer PPAR-γ as a new target for the prevention and treatment of hypertension-associated vascular disorders. IntroductionHypertension and hypertension-induced vascular remodeling underlie numerous cardiovascular disorders. Activated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) 2The abbreviations used are: VSMCvascular smooth muscle cellα-SMAα-smooth muscle actinSM22αsmooth muscle 22αWKYWistar-KyotoSHRspontaneously hypertensive ratSBPsystolic blood pressureIMTintima-media thickeningPI3Kphosphoinositide 3-kinasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAPPAR-γperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidePtdIns-4,5-P2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-phosphatescrscrambled sequenceovoverexpressionkdknockdown. are essential contributors to this vascular remodeling (1Hayashi K. Naiki T. J. Mech. Behav. Biomed. Mater. 2009; 2: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Unlike other muscle cells, VSMCs do not terminally differentiate. They can switch from a differentiated phenotype (also known as contractile or quiescent phenotype) to a dedifferentiated phenotype (also known as synthetic or activated phenotype) in response to vascular injury. In this process, VSMCs regain their proliferative and migratory capacities, secrete matrix proteins, and down-regulate smooth muscle contractile proteins, such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), smooth muscle 22α (SM22α), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, and calponin (2Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2535) Google Scholar). Although this phenotypic modulation is undoubtedly required for vascular repair, inappropriate modulation is associated with increased vascular resistance and aggravates vascular injury. However, despite intensive research efforts, the precise mechanisms underlying VSMC phenotypic modulation during hypertension remain unclear.The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ is a ligand-activated transcription factor (3Kliewer S.A. Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 239-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). It regulates various genes involved in glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and adipocyte differentiation via binding to the PPAR response elements in target genes, and therefore participates in modulation of several diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis (4Marx N. Duez H. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1168-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 5Hsueh W.A. Bruemmer D. Hypertension. 2004; 43: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Convincing evidence indicates the role of PPAR-γ in hypertension. For example, individuals with a dominant-negative PPAR-γ mutation present with early onset hypertension and elements of metabolic syndrome (6Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 1999; 402: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar).PPAR-γ is expressed in VSMCs in vivo and in vitro (7Law R.E. Goetze S. Xi X.P. Jackson S. Kawano Y. Demer L. Fishbein M.C. Meehan W.P. Hsueh W.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and exerts an important role in the regulation of VSMC viability. In spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR)-derived VSMCs, PPAR-γ overexpression or treatment with the PPAR-γ agonist thiazolidinedione retards VSMC growth to the level of non-hypertensive rat VSMCs (8Xiong C. Mou Y. Zhang J. Fu M. Chen Y.E. Akinbami M.A. Cui T. Life Sci. 2005; 77: 3037-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9Bruemmer D. Law R.E. Am. J. Med. 2003; 115: 87S-92SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, PPAR-γ inhibits the VSMC proliferation induced by platelet-derived growth factor and angiotensin II (7Law R.E. Goetze S. Xi X.P. Jackson S. Kawano Y. Demer L. Fishbein M.C. Meehan W.P.

Commun. 2000; 273: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is also reported that PPAR-γ can suppress the VSMC invasion (11Goetze S. Kintscher U. Kim S. Meehan W.P. Kaneshiro K.

Lazar M.A. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Considering that phenotypic modulation is a prerequisite for VSMCs to regain the proliferative and migratory capacity (14Sung H.J. Eskin S.G. Sakurai Y. Yee A. Kataoka N. McIntire L.V. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2005; 33: 1546-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we postulate that PPAR-γ can negatively regulate the phenotypic modulation of VSMCs.Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular growth, apoptosis, and metabolism (15Kondapaka S.B.

Activated PI3K phosphorylates Akt and induces the expression of transcriptional factors involved in multiple processes. The PI3K/Akt signaling is reportedly required for VSMC migration and proliferation, absence of Akt impairs VSMC proliferation and migration (17Fernández-Hernando C. József L. Jenkins D. Di Lorenzo A.

In striking contrast, overexpression of MSMEG_4247 resulted in the accumulation of dwarfed LM/LAM, although monomannose branching was restored. The dwarfed LAM carried a mannan chain less than half the length of wild-type LAM and was elaborated by an arabinan that was about 4 times smaller. Induced overexpression of an elongating α1,6-mannosyltransferase competed with the overexpressed branching enzyme, alleviating the dwarfing effect of the branching enzyme.

DAPK functions as a positive mediator of apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli, including interferon γ, transforming growth factor β, ceramide, and the oncogenes c-myc and p53 (for a review see Ref. 1Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and as negative mediator of apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor α (3Jin Y. Blue E.K. Gallagher P.J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 16792-16802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Forced expression of DAPK results in morphological changes, including cell rounding, shrinking, detachment, and anoikis in multiple cell types (4Kuo J.C. Wang W.J. Yao C.C. Wu P.R. Chen R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Wang W.J. Kuo J.C. Yao C.C. Chen R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In animal studies, the expression level of DAPK was inversely correlated with the metastatic potential of tumors and reintroduction of DAPK into the metastatic tumor-initiated anoikis (7Inbal B. Cohen O. Polak-Charcon S. Kopolovic J. Vadai E. Eisenbach L. Kimchi A. Nature. 1997; 390: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). DAPK has also been suggested to be a tumor suppressor, and in human cancers, DNA methylation within the promoter of DAPK is a frequent event and strongly correlates with the rates of recurrence and metastasis (1Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Loss or reduced expression of DAPK underlies the cases of heritable predisposition to chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the majority of sporadic chronic lymphocytic leukemia (8Raval A. Tanner S.M. Byrd J.C. Angerman E.B. Perko J.D. Chen S.S. Hackanson B. Grever M.R. Lucas D.M. Matkovic J.J. Lin T.S. Kipps T.J. Murray F. Weisenburger D. Sanger W. Lynch J. Watson P. Jansen M. Yoshinaga Y.

Recent studies focusing on the post-transcriptional control of DAPK have identified a complex network regulating the protein levels of DAPK. Translation repression of DAPK occurs by the interferon-γ-activated inhibitor of translation complex (9Mukhopadhyay R. Ray P.S. Arif A. Brady A.K. Kinter M. Fox P.L. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 371-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Post-translational control of DAPK protein levels is regulated by at least two distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, C-terminal HSC70-interacting protein E3 ubiquitin ligase (CHIP) (10Zhang L. Nephew K.P. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11795-11804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and Mind bomb1 (Mib1) (11Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46980-46986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which polyubiquitinate DAPK resulting in proteasomal degradation. In addition, the lysosomal protease cathepsin B (6Lin Y. Stevens C. Hupp T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16792-16802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) negatively regulates protein levels of DAPK. Finally, a small alternatively spliced form of DAPK was shown to cause decreased stability of full-length DAPK independent of the proteasome or lysosome (12Lin Y. Stevens C. Harrison B. Pathuri S. Amin E. Hupp T.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 328: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). death-associated protein kinase protein phosphatase 2A calcium/calmodulin poly-ADP-ribose polymerase carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid short interfering RNA short hairpin RNA empty vector okadaic acid human embryonic kidney wild type. The catalytic activity of DAPK is regulated by Ca2+/CaM and by autophosphorylation of Ser-308, which resides within the calmodulin-binding domain (3Jin Y. Blue E.K. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39033-39040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Shohat G. Spivak-Kroizman T. Cohen O. Bialik S. Shani G. Berrisi H. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47460-47467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of Ser-308 prevents calmodulin binding, which is necessary for the kinase activity of DAPK; thus, Ser-308 phosphorylation negatively regulates DAPK activity (3Jin Y. Blue E.K. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39033-39040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Shohat G. Spivak-Kroizman T. Cohen O. Bialik S. Shani G. Berrisi H. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47460-47467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Despite the obvious importance associated with dephosphorylation of Ser-308, the phosphatase that dephosphorylates this site has not been extensively characterized. The unphosphorylated, active form of DAPK is rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (3Jin Y. Blue E.K. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39033-39040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), thereby providing an additional mechanism to limit DAPK activity. Thus, the Ser-308 phosphatase not only controls DAPK activation but also DAPK levels. Recent evidence has suggested that a PP2A-like phosphatase may control Ser-308 phosphorylation; however, the specific holoenzyme form(s) of PP2A involved in this event is unknown (14Gozuacik D. Bialik S. Raveh T. Mitou G. Shohat G. Sabanay H. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Kimchi A. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1875-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). PP2A is a major Ser/Thr protein phosphatase that regulates numerous cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (15Eichhorn P.J. Creyghton M.P. Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1795: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The predominant form of PP2A is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme consisting of a scaffolding/structural subunit (A), a regulatory subunit (B), and a catalytic subunit (C). The regulatory B subunit is the substrate targeting subunit for PP2A and is categorized into four distinct families B, B′, B″, and B‴ (16Adams D.G. Coffee Jr., R.L. Zhang H. Pelech S. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42644-42654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Multiple isoforms exist within each family, and they share significant amino acid homology as well as some of the same substrates, whereas regulatory B subunits in different families lack amino acid homology and have distinct functions (for a review see Ref. 15Eichhorn P.J. Creyghton M.P. Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1795: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The diversity of holoenzymes enables PP2A to have selectivity and a wide range of functions within the cell. Ceramide is a potent activator of DAPK, and this kinase is necessary for ceramide-induced cell death in multiple cell types, but the cellular mechanism leading to death is unclear (3Jin Y. Blue E.K. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39033-39040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Pelled D. Raveh T. Riebeling C. Fridkin M. Berissi H. Futerman A.H. Kimchi A.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The activation of DAPK by ceramide is thought to be mediated by a ceramide-activated phosphatase; however, the identity of this phosphatase remains uncertain (14Gozuacik D. Bialik S. Raveh T. Mitou G. Shohat G. Sabanay H. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Kimchi A. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1875-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Once active, DAPK phosphorylates substrates, including myosin regulatory light chain at Ser-19, to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, and migration (3Jin Y. Blue E.K. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39033-39040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Kuo J.C. Wang W.J. Yao C.C. Wu P.R. Chen R.H. J.

Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of DAPK has been shown to suppress β-integrin-mediated cell adhesion through disrupting the association of Talin and CDC42 (4Kuo J.C. Wang W.J. Yao C.C. Wu P.R. Chen R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although a PP2A-like enzyme was recently identified as the putative phosphatase that dephosphorylates Ser(P)-308 in DAPK (14Gozuacik D. Bialik S. Raveh T. Mitou G. Shohat G. Sabanay H. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Kimchi A. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1875-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), additional studies are needed to determine whether PP2A is indeed responsible for dephosphorylation of Ser(P)-308 and, if so, to identify the unique holoenzyme(s) involved. In a screen to identify potential DAPK-binding partners, we identified the PP2A regulatory Bα subunit as a candidate DAPK-binding partner. Additional experiments indicated that the highly homologous Bδ regulatory subunit also associates with DAPK. Furthermore, we determined that Bα- and Bδ-containing holoenzymes control both the stability and activity of DAPK via their interaction with DAPK and their dephosphorylation of Ser(P)-308. Overexpression of a DAPK mutant that cannot be phosphorylated, DAPK S308A, induced cell detachment, whereas overexpression of the phosphomimetic, DAPK S308E, completely abolished the ability of DAPK to promote loss of adhesion. Finally, we show that ceramide-treated HeLa cells required activation of DAPK by PP2A to undergo anoikis. Collectively, these data indicate a complex regulation of the kinase activity and protein turnover of DAPK by PP2A holoenzymes, ABαC and ABδC.

TrueBlotTM anti-mouse secondary antibody was from eBioscience (San Diego). The expression vector for human DAPK, pcDNA3-DAPK, was kindly provided by Dr. Adi Kimchi (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel). Ser-308 mutant constructs were generated using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) with mutated oligonucleotide primers corresponding to mutation sites. Domain expression plasmids of DAPK containing either the ankyrin repeats (amino acids 372–628), cytoskeletal (amino acids 628–1215), or death domain tail (amino acid 1216–1457) were generated by PCR and ligation into the pcDNA3.1/His expression vector. Doxycycline-inducible expression plasmids for the regulatory B subunits, Bα-, Bδ-, and B′β-pcDNA5/TO, and empty vector (EV) (pcDNA5/TO) were described previously (16Adams D.G. Coffee Jr., R.L.

HEK T-Rex, HeLa, and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection of HeLa and HEK293 cells was carried out using equal plasmid DNA (adjusted with the corresponding empty vectors) together with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for Bα were obtained from Dharmacon (target sequence 5′-UGUAGUAGGAUCUCUAUAC-3′) as well as a SMARTpool for Bδ. Nontargeting siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon and used as negative control. Lipofectamine 2000 was used for the siRNA transfection. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (21Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures, including microcystin LR, cantharidin, (−)-p-bromotetramisole, and OA (Sigma phosphatase inhibitor mixture-1), where appropriate. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate and protease inhibitors). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was precleared by incubation with Trueblot IgG (eBioscience) beads. For each immunoprecipitation, 1-ml aliquots of lysates (1 mg of protein) were incubated with 4–8 μg of DAP-3 antibody at 4 °C for 3 h. The immune complexes were then isolated by the addition of 40 μl of protein G beads and incubation for 2 h. FLAG-tagged proteins were isolated by incubating 1-ml aliquots of lysates (1 mg of protein) with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-FLAG-agarose at 4 °C for 3 h. Immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer to reduce nonspecific binding. The immune complexes were resolved by electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting. Isolation of endogenous forms of PP2A with microcystin-agarose was performed as described previously (22Westphal R.S. Coffee Jr., R.L. Marotta A. Pelech S.L. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 687-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cell lines were lysed in buffer containing (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture). Soluble lysates (2 mg) were preincubated with DMSO or 5 μm microcystin-LR for 1 h at 4C. Microcystin-agarose (25 μl of 1:1 slurry) was added to lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed six times with lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. RNA was extracted from HEK T-Rex and HeLa cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 0.5 μg of RNA was used as template for reverse transcription using Superscript first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNAs were resuspended in 20 μl of H2O. The cDNA levels of specific genes were measured by quantitative real time PCR using Absolute quantitative PCR mixtures (ABgene) and an ABI 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The gene-specific primers used for quantitative PCR mixtures were as follows: sense hHPRT1, 5′-CCT TGG TCA GGC AGT ATA ATC CA-3′, and antisense hHPRT1, 5′-GGT CCT TTT CAC CAG CAA GCT-3′; sense hDAPK1, 5′-CCC GGA AAA AAA TGG AAA CAA-3′, and antisense, hDAPK1 5′-TGG ACA GGA ATG ACC TGG ATA AT-3′; sense hPPP2R2A (Bα), 5′-AGC AGG GTC ACC ATT TGC-3′, and antisense hPPP2R2A (Bα), 5′-ACC TGA GAA AAA CAC CAC TGA AT-3′; and sense hPPP2R2D (Bδ), 5′-TGG CAC TTA GAA ATC ACA GAT AGA A-3′, and antisense hPPP2R2D (Bδ), 5′-AAC TCG GCT GCA GTG ATG A-3′. All samples were amplified in duplicate, and every experiment was repeated independently at least two times. Relative gene expression was converted using the 2−ΔΔCt method against the internal control HPRT1 housekeeping gene as described previously (23Zhou J. Zhang M. Fang H. El-Mounayri O. Rodenberg J.M. Imbalzano A.N. Herring B.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Full-length human DAPK was cloned into tandem affinity purification (TAP) vector (Stratagene) using a standard PCR-based cloning strategy. HEK293 cells were seeded in 15-cm plates and then transiently transfected with DAPK-TAP (15 μg of plasmid/plate). The TAP protocol was essential as described by the manufacturer. The final eluted bound samples were concentrated and submitted to the Indiana Center for Applied Proteomics for analysis, including tryptic digestion, high performance liquid chromatography separation, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to determine peptide sequences. PP2A ABαC and ABδC holoenzymes were prepared as described previously (24Adams D.G. Wadzinski B.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 101-111PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK T-Rex cell lines harboring pcDNA5-TO (EV), Bα-FLAG-pcDNA5-TO, or Bδ-FLAG-pcDNA5-TO were treated with 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 48 h to induce protein expression. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. The clarified cell lysates were incubated with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-FLAG-agarose for 4 h. Bound proteins were washed twice with PAN buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 17 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 mm NaCl) containing 0.5% Igepal CA-630, once with PAN buffer, and once in phosphatase assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Bound proteins were eluted by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in 100 μl of phosphatase assay buffer containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The amount of PP2A catalytic subunit in the purified PP2A holoenzymes was determined by SDS-PAGE and silver staining using serial dilutions of bovine serum albumin as standards as described previously (24Adams D.G. Wadzinski B.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 101-111PubMed Google Scholar). These values were used to calculate the protein concentration of purified PP2A holoenzymes based upon stoichiometric levels of the A, B, and C subunits in each preparation. Aliquots of the purified holoenzymes were either assayed for phosphatase activity or subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver stain or immunoblot analysis. Protein phosphatase assays were performed essentially as described previously (16Adams D.G. Coffee Jr., R.L. Zhang H. Pelech S. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42644-42654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-DAPK for 48 h, and DAPK was immunoprecipitated from clarified cell lysates (1 mg of protein) using 40 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose for 4 h in lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures). The FLAG-DAPK immune complexes were washed once in lysis buffer containing both protease and phosphatase inhibitors and twice in phosphatase assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and then resuspended in 40 μl of the same buffer. The washed immune complexes were incubated with purified ABαC and ABδC holoenzymes (∼100 ng); FLAG peptide eluates for EV-expressing cells were used as a control. Following a 30-min incubation (with agitation) at 37 °C, the phosphatase reactions were terminated by washing twice in phosphatase assay buffer containing 100 nm okadaic acid and subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies recognizing. For the experiments coupled to an in vitro kinase assay, 20% of the reaction products from the phosphatase assay were analyzed by immunoblotting, and the remaining 80% was used in a kinase assay. For the kinase assay, the beads were washed extensively in kinase assay buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 μm calmodulin, and 100 nm okadaic acid). The kinase reactions were carried out as described previously (25Ma J. Arnold H.K. Lilly M.B. Sears R.C. Kraft A.S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5145-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Kinase assays (40 μl) contained kinase assay buffer, 100 μm DAPK peptide substrate (Tocris), and [γ-32P]ATP (200 cpm/pmol) diluted in 1 mm cold ATP. Incubation was carried out for 30 °C for up to 22.5 min with agitation, collecting 10 μl of the reaction at each time point. The amount of [γ-32P]ATP incorporation into the synthetic DAPK peptide substrate was analyzed as described previously using a scintillation counter (9Mukhopadhyay R. Ray P.S. Arif A. Brady A.K. Kinter M. Fox P.L. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 371-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The calmodulin overlay assay was performed as described previously (3Jin Y. Blue E.K. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39033-39040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated DAPK was treated with PP2A holoenzymes in an in vitro phosphatase assay. Following SDS-PAGE, DAPK was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with 100 nm biotinylated CaM (Sigma) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Ca2+, and 5% nonfat dry milk. Calmodulin was detected with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (The Jackson Laboratory). HeLa cells were transduced with recombinant adenovirus directing expression of either DAPK (Ad-DAPK), green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP), a control scrambled shRNA (Ad-shScr), or an shRNA for depletion of endogenous DAPK (AD-shDAPK) for 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and collected in 1% paraformaldehyde for analysis using a Beckman Coulter cell counter or in RIPA lysis buffer for SDS-PAGE. Cell detachment was quantified by counting only adherent cells. Briefly, cells were washed twice in PBS to remove detached cells. Adherent cells were then trypsinized and counted with a Beckman Coulter cell counter. The extent of cell detachment is defined as (the number of control cells − the number of treated cells)/(the number of control cells). For the HEK293 detachment assay, control cells were transiently transfected with EV. Treated cells were transfected with WT-DAPK, S308A, or S308E. In the ceramide-induced anoikis experiments, HeLa cells were transduced with adenovirus for 48 h and then incubated in the presence of DMSO (control) or C6-ceramide (treated) for 16 h. All experiments were carried out using independent cell transfections, in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, and graphs were created using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego). Western blotting images are representative of (n ≥ 3) repeated experiments. All densitometry analyses of Western data were normalized to vinculin levels. To identify novel DAPK-interacting proteins in HEK293 cells, we exploited a TAP approach that consists of two specific binding and elution steps that are designed to minimize nonspecific interactions. The affinity-purified proteins were identified using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (data not shown). Of the several proteins identified using this TAP screen, the regulatory Bα subunit of PP2A was selected for further study. To validate the TAP results, we examined the ability of DAPK to co-immunoprecipitate with Bα and the highly homologous (90% identity) Bδ subunit of PP2A. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using HEK T-REX stable cell lines expressing either EV, FLAG-Bα (Bα), or FLAG-Bδ (Bδ) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Western analysis of the FLAG immune complexes confirmed endogenous DAPK immunoprecipitates with Bα and the closely related Bδ isoform; no DAPK was detected in the control immune complexes (Fig. 1A). Additionally, both the structural (A) and catalytic (C) subunits of PP2A were detected in the FLAG-B subunit eluates, whereas no PP2A subunits were observed in FLAG immune complexes isolated from lysates of control cells. Similarly, Western analysis of FLAG-DAPK immune complexes revealed that endog"

We have previously described a presynaptic mechanism for synaptic homeostasis and plasticity that involves scaling the level of vesicular glutamate (VGLUT1) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (VGAT) transporter biosynthesis. These molecular determinants of vesicle filling and quantal size are regulated by neuronal activity in an opposite manner and bi-directionally. Here, we report that a striking induction of VGLUT2 mRNA and synaptic protein is triggered by a prolonged increase in glutamatergic synaptic activity in mature neocortical neuronal networks in vitro together with two determinants of inhibitory synaptic strength, the neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin (Narp), and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65). Activity-dependent induction of VGLUT2 and Narp exhibits a similar intermediate-early gene response that is blocked by actinomycin D and tetrodotoxin, by inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and is dependent on downstream signaling via calmodulin, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). The co-induction of VGLUT2 and Narp triggered by prolonged γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor blockade is independent of brain-derived nerve growth factor and TrkB receptor signaling. VGLUT2 protein induction occurs on a subset of cortically derived synaptic vesicles in excitatory synapses on somata and dendritic processes of multipolar GABAergic interneurons, recognized sites for the clustering of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate glutamate receptors by Narp. We propose that VGLUT2 and Narp induction by excitation-transcription coupling leads to increased glutamatergic transmission at synapses on GABAergic inhibitory feedback neurons as part of a coordinated program of Ca2+-signal transcription involved in mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity after prolonged hyperactivity.

However, recent evidence has established that in mature neurons, homeostatic plasticity also includes the presynaptic scaling of quantal size; i.e. the amount of glutamate and GABA released from individual synaptic vesicles (11Wilson N.R.

Variations in the quantal size of glutamate released at mammalian excitatory synapses in vivo is due to differences in the concentration of glutamate within vesicles (Ref. 16Wu X.S. Xue L. Mohan R.

Indeed, activity-dependent scaling the level of gene transcription for the vesicular glutamate and GABA transporters (VGLUT1 and VGAT) is an endogenous mechanism used to regulate the number of these transporters on individual vesicles in synaptic terminals and, hence, the amount of glutamate and GABA that is available for exocytotic release (18Erickson J.D.

Whereas decreased synaptic strength occurs at most excitatory synapses after prolonged neuronal hyperactivity (5Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar), increased glutamatergic synaptic strength has been reported at GABAergic bipolar interneurons (19Rutherford L.C. DeWan A.

Neurosci. 2004; 5: 97-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin (Narp) polypeptide appears to play a key role in regulating AMPA glutamate receptor clustering at excitatory synapses found on hippocampal inhibitory interneurons (22O'Brien R.J. Xu D. Petralia R.S. Steward O. Huganir R.L. Worley P. Neuron. 1999; 23: 309-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 23Mi R. Tang X. Sutter R. Xu D. Worley P. O'Brien R.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7606-7616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sustained increases in Narp released from excitatory neurons may, therefore, contribute to increases in inhibitory feedback induced by chronic neuronal stimulation (24Reti I.M. Baraban J.M. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000; 23: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Increased GABAergic transmission can also occur by increased vesicular filling with GABA by altering the biosynthesis, degradation, or re-uptake of GABA to control cytoplasmic GABA levels (25Engel D.

A reduction in GAD65, GAD67, and GABA expression is observed by prolonged neuronal inactivity in vitro and in vivo (7Kilman V. van Rossum M.C. Turrigiano G.G. J.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for scaling vesicular glutamate and GABA transporter biosynthesis during postnatal development and in mature cortical synapses by neuronal activity are not known. The functional implications for differential VGLUT gene regulation and trafficking of VGLUT isoforms to distinct axonal terminals distinguishes mammalian cortical excitatory synapses from glutamatergic synapses in simpler organisms like Drosophila, which only expresses a single VGLUT homologue (30Daniels R.W.

In addition, recent work indicates that intrinsic VGLUT2-encoded excitatory transmission is retained in the adult neocortex, and it appears to be involved in certain aspects of cognitive, emotional, and social behavior (39Wallén-Mackenzie A. Nordenankar K. Fejgin K. Lagerström M.C. Emilsson L. Fredriksson R. Wass C. Andersson D. Egecioglu E. Andersson M. Strandberg J. Lindhe O. Schiöth H.B. Chergui K. Hanse E. Långström B. Fredriksson A.

Here, we describe an activity-dependent mechanism of VGLUT2 and Narp gene induction in mature neocortical neurons that involves excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling, a process initiated by Ca2+ signal transcription that results in early, intermediate-early, and long term changes in gene expression (41Tsuda M. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 42Bading H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5280-5283Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 43Dolmetsch R. Sci.

Safa P. Tsien R.W. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 849-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). E-T coupling in central cortical neurons can be initiated by Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) and includes calmodulin-signaling and phosphorylation via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (45Wheeler D.G.

Ronjat M. De Waard M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 1096-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that VGLUT2 and Narp co-induction is an intermediate-early gene response to prolonged hyperactivity that includes Ca2+ calmodulin, CaMK, and ERK1/2 signaling. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB signaling also activates Narp expression alone. We conclude that E-T coupling triggered by a prolonged increase in glutamatergic synaptic activity in neocortical neurons in vitro is a mechanism used to activate Ca2+ signal transcription of VGLUT2 and Narp to scale the strength of glutamatergic synapses on inhibitory interneurons in long term activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.

Dissected cortical tissue from E18 embryos was placed in Neurobasal medium containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% papain, and 5 mm l-cysteine and incubated with gentle shaking at 37 °C for 20 min. The tissue pieces were then removed, rinsed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin and dissociated by gentle trituration using fire polished Pasteur pipettes in complete Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mm Glutamax (Invitrogen). Cell viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion to be >95%. Cells were plated at 7.5 × 105 cells per well in poly-d-lysine-coated (50 μg/ml; Sigma) 6-well clusters. Cells were initially plated in the presence of glutamate (25 μm), but thereafter complete medium without glutamate was used to refresh the cultures. For the first week the medium was changed twice (50% replacement), but thereafter the medium was changed 3 times per week (25% replacement). PC12 cells (PC12A123.7) were cultured and transfected with cDNA plasmids containing VGLUT1 and/or VGLUT2 by Lipofectamine as described (50Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol.

Disinhibition results in the increase in endogenous synaptic excitatory activity that includes the release of glutamate and other excitatory molecules. We generally pretreat cultures (15–30 min) with drugs before the addition of gabazine (20 μm). Tetrodotoxin was obtained from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole, recombinant TrkB/Fc chimera, and gabazine (SR-95531) were obtained from Sigma. KN-93 and K-252a were obtained from EMD Chemicals (Newark, NJ). All other drugs were obtained from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). DMSO concentrations, when required to dissolve compounds, did not exceed 0.05% and did not affect our results. Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy MINI kit (Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells in each well were harvested in a volume of 350 μl and then disrupted using three 1-s pulses with a probe sonicator.

The reactions were setup in duplicate in a 25-μl total volume with 5 pmol of each primer, 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 200 ng of template. The PCR cycle was 95 °C for 3 min, 42 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. A melt curve analysis performed for each primer pair was used to verify that a single product was amplified. Furthermore, the sizes of the amplified DNA fragments using the various primers sets were verified by gel electrophoresis and restriction analysis. The PCR amplification of each product is initially assessed using 10-fold dilution of a rat cDNA library prepared from dissociated neocortical neuronal cultures (DIV18) as a template and found to be linear over 5 orders of magnitude and greater than 95% efficient. The amplification and analysis were performed using an iCycler iQ Multicolor Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Samples were compared using the relative CT method as described (12De Gois S.

Data were normalized to the β-actin housekeeping gene. Group means are presented with their S.E. Statistical differences were determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min on ice. Cells were rinsed 3 times for 10 min with PBS, post-fixed on ice with −20 °C methanol for 10 min, and followed by the same rinse in PBS. Cells were incubated with blocking buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 and 6% normal goat serum) in PBS for at least 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The antibodies against VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 were characterized previously (56Schäfer M.K. Varoqui H. Defamie N. Weihe E. Erickson J.D. J. Biol.

Other antibodies used were commercially available: mouse anti-synaptophysin (1:1000, SVP38; Sigma), mouse anti-GAD67 (1:100, Chemicon), rabbit anti-GABA (1:500, Sigma), mouse anti-MAP2 (1:250, Chemicon). Primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer were incubated with cells overnight at 4 °C. After 3 washes for 10 min with PBS, species-specific and highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 488, 594, or 647 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer were applied for 1 h at room temperature and followed by three PBS washes. In some samples nuclear staining was performed after the final wash by 10 min of incubation with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml) in PBS. Cells were mounted with Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and viewed. All images were obtained from a Leica DMRXA automated upright epifluorescent microscope (Nussloch, Germany), a Sensicam QE charge-coupled devise digital camera (Cooke Corp., Romulus, MI), and suitable filter sets (Chroma sets 41001, 31004, and 41008/41022; Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). Some images were deconvolved using Slidebook 4.0 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). For puncta quantification, control and gabazine images were acquired using equal exposure times in stacks of 15–25 planes at 0.2 μm depth intervals and deconvolved with a constrained iterative algorithm, which preserves the original image intensity scale as described (12De Gois S. Schäfer M.K. Defamie N. Chen C. Ricci A. Weihe E. Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7121-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Analysis involved the creation of a digital binary mask by segmenting areas over threshold from each fluorescence channels within all captured planes and Slidebook-driven mathematical object statistics (size and mean intensity in red and green channels) calculations. Objects were pruned by size, and analysis with a pixel correlation algorithm identified colocalized objects as described (12De Gois S. Schäfer M.K. Defamie N. Chen C. Ricci A. Weihe E. Varoqui H.

Synaptic vesicles were prepared from differentiated neocortical cultures treated with gabazine and from transfected PC12 cells. Confluent cells (10 cm2) were rinsed with PBS, scraped in 1 ml of cold PBS containing 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and “cracked” in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using 11 stokes in a ball-bearing device. Homogenates of PC12 cells were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min. Homogenates from neocortical neuronal cultures were centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants containing vesicles were directly used for immunoprecipitation or immunoisolation experiments. For analysis of the time-course of VGLUT2 expression after gabazine treatment, vesicle membranes from post-35,000 × g supernatants were pelleted by high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min) and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting. Immobilized protein A-agarose beads (Roche Diagnostics) were washed three times with PBS. Then, 20 μg of affinity-purified rabbit antibody against VGLUT1, VGLUT2, or synaptophysin was coupled to 25 μl of beads by incubation for 2 h at room temperature. Coupled beads were washed 5 times in PBS and blocked for 10 min with PBS containing 2% glycine, 2% lysine (w/v) followed by a final PBS wash. For immunoisolation, the immunobeads were gently rotated with sample (∼400 μg of protein) overnight at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, vesicle suspensions were solubilized with nonionic detergent by the addition of Nonidet-P40 to 1% and EDTA/EGTA to 1 mm and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The solubilized samples were clarified by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min. Immunobeads were gently rotated with the sample overnight at 4 °C. Control beads were beads coupled with nonspecific rabbit IgGs. Beads were separated from unbound proteins in the supernatant by brief centrifugation (30 s) and washed 5 times with cold PBS with or without 1% Nonidet P-40. Protein samples were dissolved in Laemmli SDS sample buffer, size-fractionated on 10% precise Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using standard protocols. VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and synaptophysin were detected using their respective primary antibodies (guinea pig anti-VGLUT1 or VGLUT2, 1/4000, and mouse anti-p38 from Sigma, 1/5000) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-guinea pig or mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Sigma, 1/8000) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (West Pico, Pierce) and exposure to film (Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham Biosciences).

https://openalex.org/W1980276310,"Inflammation is often accompanied by robust angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) express erbB receptors and their ligand, neuregulin-1, and can respond to neuregulin by proliferation and angiogenesis. We hypothesized that some growth factor-like responses of ECs to inflammatory cytokines can be explained by cleavage of transmembrane neuregulin with subsequent release of its extracellular epidermal growth factor-like-containing domain and autocrine activation. Using a model of cultured human ECs, we found that interleukin-6 or interferon-gamma causes rapid cleavage and release of transmembrane neuregulin. Inhibitors of metalloproteinases abolish this effect. The addition of an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) blocks cytokine-induced neuregulin release. Silencing of TACE expression increases the amount of basal proneuregulin present in ECs but does not block neuregulin release in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), suggesting that other proteinases are responsible for mediating protein kinase C-dependent cleavage. Cytokines capable of inducing neuregulin cleavage stimulated ERK activation and in vitro angiogenesis (Matrigel cord formation). This effect is blocked by inhibitors that block neuregulin cleavage, erbB protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or antineuregulin-neutralizing antibodies. Cytokine-activated metalloproteinase cleavage of neuregulin may play an important role in autocrine activation of EC signaling pathways, contributing to key biological effects, perhaps including inflammation-associated angiogenesis."

IntroductionNeutrophil invasion at sites of inflammation as well as lymphocyte recirculation from blood into secondary lymphoid tissue require that free-flowing leukocytes become activated and subsequently exit the bloodstream. At the molecular level, the cells undergo a closely orchestrated cascade of interactions with the endothelium, each step consisting of a characteristic pattern of receptors, their ligands, cytokines, and chemoattractants (1Springer T.A.

While surveying the vascular bed, rapidly flowing leukocytes face the challenge to establish contact to static ligands of the endothelial layer at high velocities. Presentation of adhesion receptors on microvilli as the very distal aspects of the cell may be a functional adaptation to facilitate adhesion under high shear stress. Indeed, L-selectin transfectants in murine pre-B cells showed impaired tethering capability under flow when expressed on the cell body using a chimera consisting of the ectodomain of L-selectin linked to CD44 (4von Andrian U.H. Hasslen S.R. Nelson R.D. Erlandsen S.L. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 989-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This concept was further confirmed by adhesion assays using the same transfectants in lymphoid tissue in vivo (17Stein J.V. Cheng G. Stockton B.M. Fors B.P. Butcher E.C. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These studies established a close relationship between receptor surface topography and function, thus attaching great importance to the microvillus compartment in the context of leukocyte recruitment.Although leukocyte surface structures including microvilli, ruffles, filopodia, and lamellipodia are well described (18Chhabra E.S. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1110-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), a detailed biochemical understanding of their receptor composition is still largely missing. To date, it is well recognized that cytoplasmic interactions can regulate protein sorting (19Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). L-selectin distribution on microvilli is abolished upon mutation of its intracellular ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) binding site (20Ivetic A. Florey O. Deka J. Haskard D.O. Ager A. Ridley A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33263-33272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The tail-truncated L-selectin mutant LΔcyto containing only the membrane-proximal ERM binding site of the intracellular (IC) domain still localizes to microvilli (21Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As a consequence, cytoskeletal linkage to ERM is commonly believed to be a main determinant of surface localization. However, CD44 links to ERM proteins, too (22Legg J.W. Isacke C.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 705-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), yet shows an inverse surface expression pattern on nonprotrusive sections. Hence, definitive roles for protein domains in trafficking receptors to or away from microvilli have not been established. To investigate the process and implications of receptor segregation on leukocytes, we conducted domain swapping studies between L-selectin (microvilli) and CD44 (cell body) and evaluated the separate contributions of their extracellular (EC), transmembrane (TM), and IC domains on ultrastructural receptor localization and receptor functionality. Surprisingly, we found that the membrane-spanning domain contains the entire recognition pattern for specific receptor surface segregation on microvilli or the cell body, which in turn crucially affected the efficiency of leukocyte adhesion under flow.DISCUSSIONIn this study, the impact of the EC, TM, and IC domain of L-selectin and CD44 on adhesion receptor surface positioning and functionality was evaluated to clarify puzzling data concerning the contribution of the cytoplasmic anchorage of L-selectin and CD44. Using electron microscopy, no significant impact of the IC tail could be detected for both molecules, suggesting that receptor surface pattern is not determined by cytoplasmic interactions. However, mutations of ERM-binding residues within the proximal IC domain of L-selectin are known to abolish expression on microvilli (20Ivetic A. Florey O. Deka J. Haskard D.O. Ager A. Ridley A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33263-33272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but deleting its distal cytoplasmic tail does not (21Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), consistent with both L-selectin and CD44 being constitutively ERM-associated (22Legg J.W. Isacke C.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 705-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, ERM linkage of compartmentalized cell surface receptors seems to be necessary but not sufficient for defining their sorting to microvilli or the cell body. Further domain swapping revealed the TM domain to be a key determinant of receptor surface compartmentalization irrespective of the EC and IC domains.In polarized cells, selective targeting and intracellular stabilization at the basolateral and apical cell surface are two putative mechanisms responsible for cell polarization enabling biochemically and functionally distinct plasma membrane domains (31Matter K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R39-R42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells are microvilli-bearing on their apical site whereas the basolateral compartment remains rather flat, resembling the protrusive and flat subdomains on leukocytes. Receptors of blood-borne nonpolarized cells may be compartmentalized by a cognate sorting machinery (32Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Given our findings, it seems that leukocyte receptor compartmentalization involves two functionally separate processes: selective targeting via the TM domain and perhaps stabilization through ERM linkage present in both CD44 and L-selectin. The ERM-binding residues and TM domains are highly conserved in mammals, supporting a close functional link (Fig. 6).As a precondition for functional flow assays, the ability of the constructs to bind ligand was compared in a static environment. Neither receptor surface topology nor domain swapping influenced the adhesive function of L-selectin or CD44 (Fig. 3). Under flow, however, a significant effect on adhesion could be detected at all tested shear levels. At 0.7 and 1.8 dynes/cm2, the rolling flux of LLC was approximately 45% of that of LLL. LCC supported about 20% of the rolling flux of LLL at 0.7 dynes/cm2 and about 12% at higher shear stress (Fig. 4B), suggesting that differential attachment rates favored by microvillus-expressed receptors become more obvious at increasing shear. However, rolling velocity is not a function of either the topographic distribution (17Stein J.V. Cheng G. Stockton B.M. Fors B.P. Butcher E.C. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or of specific cytoplasmic anchorage. This is consistent with the hypothesis that receptor off-rate, determined by the EC domain, determines rolling velocity (33Krasik E.F. Hammer D.A. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2919-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Defective tethering may be caused by the missing cytoplasmic α-actinin binding site that was shown to play a central role in leukocyte tethering under flow (21Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 34Kansas G.S. Ley K. Munro J.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Indeed, the substitution of the L-selectin IC domain (LLC) primarily evoked a dramatic loss in initiating adhesion under flow (Fig. 4) but did not change surface distribution (Fig. 2). Moreover, receptor presentation on microvilli is sufficient for increased adhesion under physiologic shear conditions as shown by LLC (on microvilli) compared with LCC (on the cell body; Fig. 4, A and B). These results are further supported by reciprocal experiments using CD44 chimeras. Both microvillus-expressed constructs containing the TM domain of L-selectin (CLC, CLL) showed superior adhesion compared with their cell body-expressed counterparts under flow (Fig. 5) but not under static conditions (Fig. 3B). Thus, the strong enhancement of CD44 adhesion under flow through the introduction of the L-selectin TM segment is likely to be a functional consequence of the receptor shift from the cell body to microvilli. Together, these findings emphasize that the TM domain is responsible for specific receptor surface positioning with direct consequences on receptor functionality.The CD44 and L-selectin TM domains are both 95–100% conserved among mammalian species (Fig. 6). Our data are the first to demonstrate that these TM helices indeed take center stage in physiologic receptor function by defining surface localization. E-selectin, another member of the selectin family, is displayed ubiquitously on the surface of pre-B cell transfectants, including flat and protrusive sections (4von Andrian U.H. Hasslen S.R. Nelson R.D. Erlandsen S.L. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 989-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Despite the close relationship to L-selectin in the EC domain, its TM domain is barely conserved in mammals. Thus, it is plausible to propose that noncompartmentalization of leukocyte surface receptors constitutes a “default pathway,” whereas TM signals lead to an active segregation to the cell body or microvilli.Research about the organization of the plasma membrane has focused on cholesterol-enriched microdomains (lipid rafts) as a main constituent of distinct subdomains. The tyrosine kinase p56Lck was shown to play a central role in trafficking the CD4 receptor to microvilli in the lymphoid cell line CEM (35Foti M. Phelouzat M.A. Holm A. Rasmusson B.J. Carpentier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2008-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Notably, lymphocyte L-selectin requires functional p56Lck for the activation of the Ras pathway (36Brenner B. Gulbins E. Schlottmann K. Koppenhoefer U. Busch G.L. Walzog B. Steinhausen M.

Moreover, a PSGL-1 mutant lacking the IC tail and thus missing a putative ERM binding domain still concentrates on microvilli of primary leukocytes (6Miner J.J. Xia L. Yago T. Kappelmayer J. Liu Z. Klopocki A.G. Shao B. McDaniel J.M. Setiadi H. Schmidtke D.W. McEver R.P. Blood. 2008; 112: 2035-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because this mutant was still able to associate with lipid rafts and promote normal rolling on P-selectin, the authors hypothesized that cytoskeletal anchorage of PSGL-1 was achieved through raft molecules that, in turn, link to actin. Similarly, the deletion of the C-terminal tail of prominin, a pentaspan TM glycoprotein associated with lipid rafts, does not perturb its accumulation on microvilli (37Corbeil D. Röper K. Hannah M.J. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings support the concept of lipid raft integrity as a precondition for microvillus receptor presentation. However, other studies seem to contradict: cell body CD44 in murine fibroblasts (38Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Hyman R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not microvillus L-selectin in human primary cells (39Dwir O. Grabovsky V. Pasvolsky R. Manevich E. Shamri R. Gutwein P.

This incongruence could be due to cell type-specific discrepancies, the existence of multiple mechanisms for protein sorting, or multiple types of rafts populating different surface subdomains.The complexity of microvillus receptor expression is illustrated by the failure of transfected K562 cells to display human wild type PSGL-1 on microvilli (40Snapp K.R. Craig R. Herron M. Nelson R.D. Stoolman L.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) unlike primary cells (7Bruehl R.E. Moore K.L. Lorant D.E.

This points to possible accessory molecules necessary for PSGL-1 but not L-selectin positioning. Similarly, the CD44 receptor localizes to the planar cell body of L1–2 pre-B cells (4von Andrian U.H. Hasslen S.R. Nelson R.D. Erlandsen S.L. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 989-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), but not of a melanoma cell line (22Legg J.W. Isacke C.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 705-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Furthermore, domain swapping experiments of α4- and β2-integrins (on microvilli and on the cell body, respectively) suggest that EC interactions may be responsible for microvillus positioning (41Abitorabi M.A. Pachynski R.K. Ferrando R.E. Tidswell M. Erle D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Taken together, despite a very similar phenotype, the underlying mechanisms for the association of different surface receptors with microvilli seem to be diverse. Cytoskeletal anchorage, EC and TM interactions, as well as lipid raft integrity appear to contribute to a microvillus expression pattern. However, the surface expression patterns of CD44 and L-selectin are determined by the TM domain.Membrane-spanning domains not only function as membrane anchors but also play a critical role in receptor functionality (42Li X. Pérez L. Pan Z. Fan H. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 985-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 43Moore D.T. Berger B.W. DeGrado W.F. Structure. 2008; 16: 991-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Through lateral membrane interactions or dynamic conformational changes, TM domains are known to regulate the formation of heterogeneous protein complexes and protein folding, yet there is to date no evidence about any particular impact on receptor localization. The biological importance is highlighted by several disease-associated mutations within single-spanning TM domains clinically leading to severe pathologies such as achondroplasia, acute myeloid leukemia, or lupus (43Moore D.T. Berger B.W. DeGrado W.F. Structure. 2008; 16: 991-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because the extent of microvilli on cancer cells is correlated with the hematogenous dissemination potential of the tumor (44Azuma H. Takahara S. Ichimaru N. Wang J.D. Itoh Y. Otsuki Y. Morimoto J. Fukui R. Hoshiga M. Ishihara T. Nonomura N. Suzuki S. Okuyama A. Katsuoka Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1410-1419PubMed Google Scholar), our findings suggest that TM domains of adhesion receptors may also play a role in metastasis. Insights about the physiology of TM interactions can therefore guide studies into new therapeutic targets in inflammation and cancer metastasis. IntroductionNeutrophil invasion at sites of inflammation as well as lymphocyte recirculation from blood into secondary lymphoid tissue require that free-flowing leukocytes become activated and subsequently exit the bloodstream. At the molecular level, the cells undergo a closely orchestrated cascade of interactions with the endothelium, each step consisting of a characteristic pattern of receptors, their ligands, cytokines, and chemoattractants (1Springer T.A.

L-selectin knock-out mice show a profound defect of lymphocyte accumulation in secondary lymphatic tissue and of neutrophils at sites of inflammation (11Arbonés M.L. Ord D.C. Ley K. Ratech H. Maynard-Curry C. Otten G. Capon D.J. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 1994; 1: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). CD44 is involved in many physiological processes, including lymphocyte activation, adhesion, and proliferation (12Siegelman M.H. DeGrendele H.C. Estess P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). There is also increasing evidence that CD44 and L-selectin contribute to tumor metastasis (13Hanley W.D. Napier S.L.

While surveying the vascular bed, rapidly flowing leukocytes face the challenge to establish contact to static ligands of the endothelial layer at high velocities. Presentation of adhesion receptors on microvilli as the very distal aspects of the cell may be a functional adaptation to facilitate adhesion under high shear stress. Indeed, L-selectin transfectants in murine pre-B cells showed impaired tethering capability under flow when expressed on the cell body using a chimera consisting of the ectodomain of L-selectin linked to CD44 (4von Andrian U.H. Hasslen S.R. Nelson R.D. Erlandsen S.L. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 989-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This concept was further confirmed by adhesion assays using the same transfectants in lymphoid tissue in vivo (17Stein J.V. Cheng G. Stockton B.M. Fors B.P. Butcher E.C. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These studies established a close relationship between receptor surface topography and function, thus attaching great importance to the microvillus compartment in the context of leukocyte recruitment.Although leukocyte surface structures including microvilli, ruffles, filopodia, and lamellipodia are well described (18Chhabra E.S. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1110-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), a detailed biochemical understanding of their receptor composition is still largely missing. To date, it is well recognized that cytoplasmic interactions can regulate protein sorting (19Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). L-selectin distribution on microvilli is abolished upon mutation of its intracellular ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) binding site (20Ivetic A. Florey O. Deka J. Haskard D.O. Ager A. Ridley A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33263-33272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The tail-truncated L-selectin mutant LΔcyto containing only the membrane-proximal ERM binding site of the intracellular (IC) domain still localizes to microvilli (21Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As a consequence, cytoskeletal linkage to ERM is commonly believed to be a main determinant of surface localization. However, CD44 links to ERM proteins, too (22Legg J.W. Isacke C.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 705-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), yet shows an inverse surface expression pattern on nonprotrusive sections. Hence, definitive roles for protein domains in trafficking receptors to or away from microvilli have not been established. To investigate the process and implications of receptor segregation on leukocytes, we conducted domain swapping studies between L-selectin (microvilli) and CD44 (cell body) and evaluated the separate contributions of their extracellular (EC), transmembrane (TM), and IC domains on ultrastructural receptor localization and receptor functionality. Surprisingly, we found that the membrane-spanning domain contains the entire recognition pattern for specific receptor surface segregation on microvilli or the cell body, which in turn crucially affected the efficiency of leukocyte adhesion under flow."
https://openalex.org/W2072194715,"The Drosophila phototransduction cascade terminates in the opening of an ion channel, designated transient receptor potential (TRP). TRP has been shown to become phosphorylated in vitro, suggesting regulation of the ion channel through posttranslational modification.

Relative quantification of phosphopeptides revealed that at least seven phosphorylation sites were predominantly phosphorylated in the light, whereas one site, Ser936, was predominantly phosphorylated in the dark.

Reversible protein phosphorylation is a well established mechanism for regulating the activity of ion channels. Typically, the pattern of phosphorylation of ion channels is complex, involving several phosphorylation sites with consensus sequences for a number of protein kinases, such as protein kinase C (PKC), 3The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CACNacetonitrileFAformic acidMSmass spectrometryLCliquid chromatographyMS/MStandem mass spectrometryTRPtransient receptor potentialTRPLtransient receptor potential-likeSer(P)936-TRPTRP phosphorylated at serine 936HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyUPLCultraperformance liquid chromatographyXICextracted ion chromatogrameye-PKCeye-enriched protein kinase CPBSphosphate-buffered saline. protein kinase A, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, or casein kinase, which phosphorylate serine and threonine residues, as well as kinases phosphorylating tyrosine residues.

Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels constitute a protein family of about 30 unique homologs that are assigned to seven subfamilies on the basis of sequence homology: canonical TRPC, vanilloid TRPV, melastatin TRPM, polycystin TRPP, mucolipin TRPML, and ankyrin transmembrane proteins TRPA and NOMPC-like TRPN (3Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re3PubMed Google Scholar, 4Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). The founding member of this protein family is the Drosophila TRP channel, which, together with its homolog TRP-like (TRPL), is located in the rhabdomeral photoreceptor membrane of the fly compound eye and represents the major light-sensitive ion channel in this phospholipase C-mediated visual transduction cascade (5Minke B. Parnas M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 649-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of several TRP channels has been described. Among the vertebrate TRPC channels, TRPC3 and TRPC6 are inhibited by phosphorylation events mediated by protein kinase C and protein kinase G (6Zhang L. Saffen D. J. Biol.

Abolition of the putative protein kinase C phosphorylation site Thr635 in the S4/S5 linker region of TRPC3 by mutation results in increased channel activity and was found to underlie the phenotype of moonwalker mice, which is caused by loss of Purkinje cells (11Becker E.B.

The regulation of the capsaicin- and heat-sensitive TRPV1 channel through phosphorylation of serine residues by protein kinase C is also well established (12Bhave G. Hu H.J. Glauner K.S. Zhu W.

Besides protein kinase C, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase and protein kinase A were implicated in phosphorylation of TRPV1 (15Jung J. Shin J.S. Lee S.Y. Hwang S.W. Koo J. Cho H. Oh U. J. Biol.

This channel is part of a signaling complex assembled by the INAD scaffold protein together with phospholipase C and an eye-enriched protein kinase C (eye-PKC) encoded by the inaC gene. It was shown initially for the larger fly Calliphora vicina and later also for Drosophila that the addition of ATP to the isolated signaling complex resulted in phosphorylation of TRP and INAD, suggesting that these two proteins of the signaling complex are targets of the associated protein kinase C (17Huber A.

Shieh B.H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8570-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) revealed a PKC target site in TRP, Ser982. This site was confirmed as a bona fide phosphorylation site in vivo by mass spectrometry. Mutation of Ser982 to Ala resulted in a defect in deactivation of the photoresponse. However, this deactivation defect was observed only upon very intense illumination with white light, whereas a deactivation defect in the eye-PKC null mutant was observed also at much lower light intensities. This difference in phenotype and the observation of multiple phosphorylation sites for different protein kinases in vertebrate TRP channels suggest that additional phosphorylation sites are involved in the regulation of Drosophila TRP. Assuming that reversible phosphorylation of Drosophila TRP should be regulated by light and darkness, which trigger activation and deactivation of this ion channel, respectively, we sought to identify light-regulated phosphorylation sites using quantitative mass spectrometry. Although seven of the identified phosphorylation sites displayed enhanced phosphorylation in the light, a single phosphorylation site, Ser936, was predominantly phosphorylated in the dark and became dephosphorylated upon illumination. We show that changes in the phosphorylation state of this site were detected within minutes after switching to another light condition. Light-triggered dephosphorylation of Ser936 required activation of the phototransduction cascade, suggesting that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ may regulate the dephosphorylation of this site.

Flies were illuminated with an 18-watt fluorescent lamp, 2400 lux, unless noted otherwise. For mass spectrometry experiments, flies were illuminated with white light or were kept in the dark overnight before they were subjected to immunoprecipitation. For analyses of the TRP phosphorylation state at Ser936 in different mutants, flies were kept in the dark for 12–18 h and were then illuminated with white light for 1 h and vice versa before they were subjected to Western blot analyses. To analyze the action spectrum of TRP dephosphorylation at Ser936, flies were kept in the dark for 12–18 h and were then illuminated with white light (2400 lux; see above), blue light (acrylic glass wide band filter transmitting light between 310 and 490 nm, 30 lux), green light (acrylic glass wide band filter transmitting light between 460 and 610 nm, 140 lux), orange light (acrylic glass cut-off filter transmitting light >560 nm, 1300 Lux), or red light (acrylic glass cut-off filter transmitting light >630 nm, 270 lux) or were kept in the dark for 1 h before they were subjected to Western blot analyses. For investigation of the time course of TRP phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Ser936, flies were kept in the dark or were illuminated with white light 12–18 h before the experiment and were then subjected to the opposite light condition for different periods of time. For immunolocalization of TRP or Ser(P)936-TRP, flies were illuminated with white light, kept in the dark for 12–18 h, or illuminated with white light plus UV (150-watt xenon high pressure lamp, 20,000 lux) for 1 h before they were subjected to immunocytochemistry. Dark-kept flies were dissected under dim red light (Schott RG 630, cold light source KL1500), whereas flies kept in white or colored light were dissected under these light conditions. Fly heads from wild type or inaCP209 flies were separated from bodies by freezing in liquid nitrogen and vigorous vortexing. Heads were passed through a 45-mesh sieve holding back the bodies and were collected on a 25-mesh sieve (Neolab). Approximately 300 wild-type or inaCP209 heads were homogenized in 0.5 ml of extraction buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 μm (4-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride monohydrate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, 10 mm benzamide, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 500 nm cantharidine, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate) using a micropestle (Roth). Head homogenates were extracted on ice for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of the INAD signaling complex from Drosophila head extracts was performed with a monoclonal α-TRP antibody (MAb83F6, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). Head extracts were incubated with 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) and 6 μg of α-TRP antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C and washed four times, with 0.5 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer. Precipitated proteins were eluted from protein G-agarose beads with 25 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1.2% (w/v) SDS, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 15% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue) at 80 °C for 10 min. The eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were visualized by colloidal Coomassie Blue staining (Roth). Proteins were in-gel digested using either trypsin or chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science) according to Shevchenko et al. (26Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7830) Google Scholar). For chymotryptic digests, a modified incubation buffer was used (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm CaCl2). After digestion, the gel pieces were extracted with 50% acetonitrile (ACN), 50% 0.1% formic acid (FA) (v/v) for 15 min. The supernatant was collected, and the gel pieces were covered with 5% FA for 15 min before the same volume of ACN was added. After incubation for 10 min, the supernatant was collected. The pooled supernatants were then dried in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at −20 °C. Dried samples were dissolved in 0.1% FA. Nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS experiments were performed on an ACQUITY nano-UPLC system (Waters) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tryptic and chymotryptic digests of TRP were concentrated and desalted on a precolumn (2 cm × 180 μm, Symmetry C18, 5-μm particle size, Waters) and separated on a 20 cm × 75 μm BEH 130 C18 reversed phase column (1.7 μm particle size, Waters). Gradient elution was performed from 1% ACN to 50% ACN in 0.1% FA within 60 min. The LTQ-Orbitrap was operated under the control of XCalibur 2.0.7 software. Survey spectra (m/z = 300–1800) were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000 at m/z = 400. Data-dependent tandem mass spectra were generated for the five most abundant peptide precursors in the linear ion trap. For all measurements using the Orbitrap detector, internal calibration was performed using lock-mass ions from ambient air as described in Ref. 27Olsen J.V. Blagoev B. Gnad F. Macek B. Kumar C. Mortensen P. Mann M. Cell. 2006; 127: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar. MascotTM 2.2 (Matrix Science) and Sequest (Thermo Fisher Scientific) search engines were used for protein identification. Spectra were searched against the Drosophila subset of the NCBI protein sequence data base downloaded as FASTA-formatted sequences from the NCBI FTP site. Search parameters specified trypsin or chymotrypsin as the cleaving enzyme, allowing four missed cleavages (including cleavage before Pro), a 3 ppm mass tolerance for peptide precursors, and 0.5 Da tolerance for fragment ions. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification, and Ser, Thr, and Tyr phosphorylation, methionine oxidation, and N-terminal acetylation of proteins were allowed as variable modifications. Phosphopeptide MS/MS spectra sequence assignments and phosphorylated residues were verified manually. Quantification of light-dependent TRP phosphorylation sites was accomplished by a label-free nano-HPLC-MS method. For each light condition (light or dark), five (tryptic digests) or three (chymotryptic digests) independent experiments and a technical replicate for each experiment were performed. The commercially available SIEVE 1.2 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for alignment of chromatographic peaks as well as detection, deisotoping, and peak area determination of MS1 features (peptides) over multiple LC-MS/MS runs. The SIEVE software uses the ChromAlign algorithm (28Sadygov R.G. Maroto F.M. Hühmer A.F. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 8207-8217Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to perform chromatographic alignment between LC-MS/MS runs (e.g. see supplemental Fig. S1). After completion of the alignment step, peptide peak areas were calculated by SIEVE based on extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) of each MS feature (peptide). Peak areas of TRP phosphopeptides were extracted from the SIEVE result table for normalization. Phosphopeptide identifications were based on (a) accurate mass and retention time and (b) assignment of phosphorylated residues in the corresponding MS/MS spectra of the Mascot and Sequest search results. Only phosphopeptides that were present in all biological and technical replicates of at least one light condition (light or dark) were considered for quantification. Normalization of peak areas in all tryptic or chymotryptic LC-MS/MS runs was achieved by using unphosphorylated TRP peptides as omnipresent internal standards as described (29Ruse C.I. Willard B. Jin J.P. Haas T. Kinter M. Bond M. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1658-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Steen H. Jebanathirajah J.A. Springer M. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3948-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Normalization peptides (reference peptides) were chosen by the following criteria: (a) peptides were present in every LC-MS/MS run, (b) they were not prone to miscleavages and oxidation, and (c) they showed peak area variations among different LC-MS/MS runs that reflected the general variations of the majority of the peptides (30Steen H. Jebanathirajah J.A. Springer M. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3948-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Four reference peptides (NNYEILK, YILAPDSEGAK, GIDPYFPR, and DIFSSLAK) were used for normalization of phosphopeptides derived from tryptic digests, and two reference peptides (QIISERADTEW and ILEEYQGTDKF) were used for the chymotryptic digests. To obtain normalization factors for each experiment, the peak area of a reference peptide was divided by the mean of the peak areas of this reference peptide in the sample set. The peak area of the phosphopeptides of each experiment was then divided by each of the four (tryptic digests) or two (chymotryptic digests) normalization factors, and the resulting values were averaged to obtain the normalized peak areas of the phosphopeptides. The mean of normalized peak areas for every phosphopeptide over all LC-MS/MS runs of one light condition (light or dark) was calculated, and the higher value was set to 100%. An unpaired t test was performed for statistical evaluation of the quantification results. A synthetic phosphopeptide, NH2-CADEVpSLADD-CONH2, including Ser(P)936, was synthesized and injected into rabbits in order to produce antisera (Pineda Antibody Service, Germany). For affinity purification, the phosphopeptide was conjugated to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (GE Healthcare) (10 mg of phosphopeptide per 0.5 g of Sepharose) overnight in 2 ml of coupling buffer (0.2 m NaHCO3/Na2CO3, pH 10). After conjugation, the resin was washed once with 2.5 ml of coupling buffer, and residual active groups were blocked with 3 ml of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0, overnight. The resin was washed five times with 2.5 ml of 1× PBS (137 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4), pH 7.0, and packed into a C10/10 column with adaptor AC 10 (GE Healthcare). Unspecifically bound protein was washed off with 15 ml of 1× PBS, pH 7.0, 10 ml of 1× PBS, pH 3.0, and 15 ml of 1× PBS, pH 7.0. 15 ml of antiserum diluted in 30 ml of 1× PBS, pH 7.0, were passed over the column for 2 h, the column was washed with 10 ml of 1× PBS, pH 7.0, and bound antibody was eluted with 1× PBS, pH 3.0. Eluted fractions were adjusted to pH 7.0. The resulting antibody recognized TRP phosphorylated at Ser936 (Ser(P)936-TRP) and hereafter is referred to as α-Ser(P)936. For Western blot analyses, fly heads were homogenized in 1× SDS-PAGE extraction buffer (4% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 75 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8), and extraction was carried out for 10 min at room temperature. The extracts were centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 22 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar), using 8% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The ECL Plus Western blotting analysis system (GE Healthcare) was used for signal detection with x-ray film. The primary antibodies used for Western blot analysis were α-Ser(P)936 and α-TRP (MAb83F6, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). When needed, the α-Ser(P)936 and α-TRP signals were quantified with ImageJ 1.41o (National Institutes of Health) by determining the integrated density (i.e. the sum of the values of the pixels in a selection) of each band. α-Ser(P)936 integrated density values were divided by α-TRP values for normalization. Immunocytochemistry was carried out as described elsewhere (32Meyer N.E. Oberegelsbacher C. Dürr T.D. Schäfer A. Huber A. Fly. 2008; 2: 384-394Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used for immunocytochemistry were α-TRP (MAb83F6, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) and α-Ser(P)936. Secondary antibodies were α-mouse Cy5 (Dianova), α-rabbit Cy5 (Dianova), α-mouse AlexaFluor 488 (MoBiTec), and AlexaFluor 546-coupled phalloidin (Invitrogen). The sections were examined with the AxioImager.Z1m microscope (objective, EC Plan-Neofluar ×40/1.3 Oil, Zeiss) with the ApoTome module (Zeiss) and documented with the AxioCam MRm (Zeiss). To identify in vivo TRP phosphorylation sites, an MS-based analysis was carried out. Drosophila head extracts were prepared from either dark- or light-adapted flies. The TRP ion channel was purified by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal α-TRP antibody and size fractionation by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue, and the TRP band at 150 kDa was excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion. A representative gel is shown in Fig. 1A. TRP peptides from tryptic or chymotryptic digests were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and identified by data base searches using the Mascot and Sequest search engines, allowing protein modifications, such as oxidation of methionines, acetylation, and specifically phosphorylation. In total, a sequence coverage of 89% of the TRP protein was obtained. This includes 66% sequence coverage from tryptic peptides and 74% sequence coverage from chymotryptic peptides (Fig. 1B). Nano-LC-MS/MS analysis revealed 20 phosphorylated serine and threonine residues that were located in the C terminus of the ion channel, including the previously identified phosphorylation site Ser982 (1Popescu D.C. Ham A.J. Shieh B.H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8570-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A single phosphorylated serine residue (Ser15) was identified in the N terminus of TRP (Fig. 1, B and D). The phosphorylation sites were unambiguously identified on the basis of fragmentation spectra (LC-MS/MS analysis). A representative fragmentation spectrum (MS/MS spectrum) for the identification of phosphorylated Ser936 is shown in Fig. 1C. Fragmentation spectra for the other phosphorylation sites are included in the supplement (supplemental Fig. S2). To investigate a possible physiological function of the identified TRP phosphorylation sites, we analyzed their light dependence. In order to obtain conclusive data on the light dependence of TRP phosphorylation sites, we quantified the amount of phosphopeptides present in samples isolated from flies kept in the dark or under white light illumination using a label-free mass spectrometry approach. Only phosphopeptides that were detected in all nano-LC-MS/MS runs of at least one light condition with a signal intensity of at least 10,000 counts were subjected to quantification. 17 of the 21 identified phosphorylation sites were located on phosphopeptides that met these criteria and were quantified. At least three independent nano-LC-MS/MS runs and three corresponding technical replicates were used for quantification. Alignment of nano-LC-MS/MS runs, construction of XICs, and calculation of peak areas were accomplished by SIEVE 1.2 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative XIC of a peptide comprising the Ser936 phosphorylation site is shown in Fig. 2A. Results of the relative quantification of tryptic and chymotryptic phosphopeptides are shown in Fig. 2, B and C, respectively. When possible, the most abundant peptide variant, phosphorylated at a single, unambiguously assigned site was chosen to determine the light dependence of the respective site. However, for some phosphorylation sites, the peptide variants that could be quantified reliably comprised more than one possible phosphorylation site. In most cases, these regioisomers could not be separated by nano-UPLC and were therefore quantified together. In these cases, the number of phosphorylations present on the respective peptides is given as nxP in Fig. 2, B and C, as well as in supplemental Fig. S3, A and B. Quantification revealed that there are significant light-dependent changes in the phosphorylation state of at least eight sites. Five phosphorylation sites, Thr849, Thr864, Ser872, Ser964, and Ser982, were present as unique sites on phosphopeptides that showed significant up-regulation in illuminated flies (Fig. 2, B and C). One phosphorylation site, Ser717, could only be quantified as a doubly phosphorylated chymotryptic peptide (Fig. 2C). Because the other phosphorylation site on the corresponding tryptic peptide, Ser721, showed no significant light-dependent changes (Fig. 2B), we infer that Ser717 is predominantly phosphorylated in the light. A peptide containing either phosphorylated Ser961 or Thr963 was found at a significantly higher level in the light (Fig. 2C). Although these two sites were unambiguously identified by their fragmentation spectra, they could only be quantified together, and it is not possible to tell whether the phosphorylation of Ser961 or Thr963 or of both is up-regulated in the light. Finally, a single site, Ser936, was predominantly detected in its phosphorylated state in dark-adapted flies (Fig. 2, A and B). In order to determine which phosphorylation sites are substrates of eye-PKC, we isolated TRP from the eye-PKC null mutant inaCP209 and analyzed its phosphorylation state by LC-MS/MS. Surprisingly, all phosphopeptides that were observed in TRP isolated from wild type flies were also identified in the inaC mutant, including the peptide comprising Ser982. Moreover, the light dependence of the phosphorylation of these sites observed in wild type flies was similar in the inaC mutant, as revealed by quantitative MS analysis (supplemental Fig. S2 and Fig. 2). This suggests that the phosphorylation sites identified here are not substrates of eye-PKC, or they are phosphorylated by at least one other kinase. In the following experiments, we foc"

We demonstrate that low salt conditions result in protein aggregation that may cause dissociation of oligomeric structure. The low salt sensitivity of the mitochondrial DNA helicase is mitigated by the presence of magnesium, nucleotide, and increased temperature. Electron microscopic and glutaraldehyde cross-linking analyses provide the first evidence of a heptameric oligomer and its interconversion from a hexameric form. Limited proteolysis by trypsin shows that binding of nucleoside triphosphate produces a conformational change that is distinct from the conformation observed in the presence of nucleoside diphosphate. We find that single-stranded DNA binding occurs in the absence of cofactors and renders the mitochondrial DNA helicase more susceptible to proteolytic digestion. Our studies indicate that the human mitochondrial DNA helicase shares basic properties with the SF4 replicative helicases, but also identify common features with helicases outside the superfamily, including dynamic conformations similar to other AAA+ ATPases.

This novel enzyme has been classified as an Escherichia coli (E. coli) DnaB-like replicative helicase (or SF4 replicative helicase) (1Ziebarth T.D. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Members of SF4 were first identified in bacteria and bacteriophages. Proteins within the SF4 family possess an N-terminal primase-interacting domain (in the case of E. coli DnaB) or primase domain (in the case of bacteriophage T7 gene 4 protein, T7 gp4). The human mtDNA helicase is capable of hydrolyzing nucleotides to provide energy for DNA translocation and duplex unwinding (2Korhonen J.A. Gaspari M. Falkenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48627-48632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As purified at 330 mm NaCl, its native molecular weight is consistent with that of a hexameric quaternary structure, which is believed to be its active conformation during translocation, similar to various eukaryotic and prokaryotic helicases (1Ziebarth T.D.

The bacteriophage T7 gp4 protein exists predominantly in the hexameric state, yet both a crystal structure and electron microscopic images demonstrate a heptameric oligomer either in the absence of cofactors, or in the presence of Mg2+-dTDP (3Crampton D.J. Ohi M. Qimron U. Walz T. Richardson C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 667-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4Toth E.A. Li Y. Sawaya M.R. Cheng Y. Ellenberger T. Mol.

Cell. 2006; 21: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) recently showed that the type of nucleotide present, di- or triphosphate, is detected by a phosphate sensor at histidine 465 that dictates a conformational switch from the heptameric to hexameric state, respectively. The T7 enzyme is not unique in this aspect as the Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum minichromosomal maintenance protein (mtMCM) and the Thermus thermophilus HB8 RuvB protein also exist as heptamers, both of which are members of the SF6 family (6Miyata T. Yamada K. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Mayanagi K. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Yu X. VanLoock M.S. Poplawski A. Kelman Z. Xiang T. Tye B.K. Egelman E.H. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The SF6 helicase family comprises a divergent group of proteins that contain an N-terminal DNA-interacting domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, which are not present in proteins from SF4 (8Costa A. Onesti S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role for the heptameric conformation has yet to be established, it is clear that the state is regulated by environmental conditions. Increasing temperature has been shown to stabilize the E. coli DnaB protein (9Arai K. Yasuda S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5247-5252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Liu et al. demonstrated that the presence of nucleotide drives the bacteriophage T4 gene 41 protein dimer to a higher oligomeric state (10Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic studies of E. coli DnaB reveal that the presence of Mg2+, nucleotide or increasing salt induces the dimerization of trimers into a hexameric form, whereas electron microscopic images suggest a trimerization of dimers (11Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12San Martin M.C. Stamford N.P. Dammerova N. Dixon N.E. Carazo J.M. J. Struct.

T7 gp4 has been shown to exist as a dimer and trimer that oligomerize into hexamers in the presence of dTTP, but in the absence of Mg2+ (14Bird L.E. Hâkansson K. Pan H. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2620-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27315-27319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although all of these proteins are members of the same superfamily, different nucleotide requirements for achieving an active oligomeric state most likely serve a regulatory role that is specific to the given organism. The binding of cofactors to helicases not only induces oligomerization of the enzymes into a stable, active state, it also brings about a conformational change that is necessary for its function during replication. Limited proteolysis of E. coli DnaB protein shows a conformational change upon nucleotide binding (17Nakayama N. Arai N. Kaziro Y. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 88-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar findings reported by Romano et al. (18Yong Y. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24509-24517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) illustrate numerous conformations of T7 gp4 in the presence of various nucleotides and DNA. These conformations are presumed to facilitate nucleotide hydrolysis and the mechanism of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) translocation that leads to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) unwinding. A fundamental property required of all replicative helicases is the ability to bind to ssDNA. A crystal structure of T7 gp4 confirmed electron microscopic studies by showing that C-terminal domain loops projecting into the center of the ring are responsible for ssDNA binding (19Egelman E.H.

The ability of T7 gp4 to bind to DNA is dependent on its hexameric form and the binding of nucleotides as shown for E. coli DnaB (16Picha K.M. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27315-27319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Arai K. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

MtMCM, on the other hand, binds DNA in the absence of nucleotide as a double hexamer (24Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We explored some basic characteristics of the human mtDNA helicase by investigating aspects common to E. coli DnaB-like helicases and helicases that lie outside of this family of enzymes. We examined factors stabilizing the human mtDNA helicase under physiological ionic conditions, and found that nucleotide is required for the retention of a soluble, stable protein in a low ionic environment. We also examined oligomeric state and conformational changes under the stabilizing conditions, using hydrodynamic, electron microscopic and biochemical methods. Our study reveals dynamic features of the human mtDNA helicase that suggest the possibility of multiple levels of regulated interactions in its role in mtDNA replication. Trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and ATPγS were purchased from Sigma. Calf thymus DNA (highly polymerized Type I) was purchased from Sigma and was activated by partial digestion with DNase I (Roche Applied Science). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was from Pierce. Nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from DOT Scientific, Inc. Rabbit antisera raised against recombinant human mtDNA helicase was prepared as described by Wang et al. (25Wang Y. Farr C.L.

N- and C-terminally hexahistidine (His)-tagged human mtDNA helicase was produced by overexpression in Spodoptera frugiperda cells and purified to homogeneity, as described in Ziebarth et al.

Both N-and C-terminally tagged helicase were tested in all of the experiments shown in this report (stability, glutaraldehyde cross-linking, sedimentation, gel filtration, electron microscopy, and proteolysis), and we found no differences in the results based on the placement of the tag. Furthermore, we demonstrated in Ziebarth et al. (1Ziebarth T.D. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that the placement of the tag at either end affects neither the oligomerization properties nor the ATPase activity of the human mtDNA helicase. Reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and N-terminally His-tagged human mtDNA helicase (Fr IV; 1.25 μg, 0.12 μm as hexamer) in the absence or presence of 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ADP, 2 mm ATP, or 2 mm ATPγS as indicated. Incubation was for 1 h at 4, 24 or 37 °C followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Soluble and insoluble fractions were made 1% in SDS, heated for 2 min at 100 °C and electrophoresed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by silver staining. The data were photographed and quantitated using Kodak 1D software. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml of N-terminally His-tagged human mtDNA helicase (Fr IV; 2.5 μg, 0.12 μm as hexamer). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of four cofactors: 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ADP, 2 mm ATP, or 2 mm ATPγS and heated DNA oligomer (75 mer) as indicated. Following the incubation, cross-linking with 0.02% glutaraldehyde was performed for 20 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched with 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA followed by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid using 2 μg of cytochrome c as a carrier. Cross-linked products were separated by SDS-PAGE in a 3.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed by immunoblotting. N- and C-terminally His-tagged human mtDNA helicase (FrIV; 40 μg, 0.12 μm as hexamer) was layered onto preformed 12–30% glycerol gradients (10 ml) containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 330 or 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium metabisulfite, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Helicase was incubated for 30 min at 24 °C in the absence or presence of 4 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm ATPγS. Protein standards of known S values run in parallel were: jack bean urease, 18.6 S; bovine liver catalase, 11.3 S; rabbit muscle l-lactate dehydrogenase, 7.3 S. Centrifugation was at 37,000 rpm for 15 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 41 rotor. Fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. C-terminally His-tagged human mtDNA helicase (180 μg, 0.35 mg/ml) was chromatographed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (10 mm × 300–310 mm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 330 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.02% (v/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min at 4 °C. The column was calibrated with chymotrypsinogen A (Rs = 28 Å), hen egg ovalbumin (Rs = 30 Å), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (Rs = 46 Å), bovine liver catalase (Rs = 52 Å) and bovine thyroid thyroglobulin (Rs = 85 Å), where Rs is the Stoke's radius. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected, and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining to confirm ultraviolet trace recordings. C-terminally His-tagged human mtDNA helicase was diluted in a buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, ATPγS, MgCl2 and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside to achieve final concentrations of 2 mm ATPγS, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.02% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, and 100 mm NaCl. The sample was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, chilled to 0 °C, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant fraction (180 μg, 0.18 mg/ml) was chromatographed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with buffer containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, 2 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.02% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min at 4 °C. Fractions (0.25 ml) were analyzed as described above. Protein samples were adsorbed directly onto carbon/collodion-coated copper grids that had been glow discharged. Following negative staining with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate, the samples were visualized in a JEOL JEM-1011 electron microscope. Micrographs were taken at a magnification of 50,000× and scanned in a Zeiss scanner resulting in a final pixel size of 4.2 A/pixels in the object scale. Image processing analysis was carried out using the XMIPP package (27Sorzano C.O. Marabini R. Velázquez-Muriel J. Bilbao-Castro J.R. Scheres S.H.W. Carazo J.M. Pascual-Montano A. J. Struct.

The algorithm refine2d.py from the EMAN package was used for the 330 mm NaCl samples (31Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were preincubated for 1 h in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST), and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk. The membranes were probed with human mtDNA helicase antibody (1:100 in TBST and 1% nonfat milk), for 2 h and then washed three times for 5 min each with TBST. After the washes were complete, incubation for 1 h was performed with goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:1500 (v/v) in TBST with 1% nonfat milk), and then the membranes were washed three times for 5 min with TBST, and once for 5 min in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2 (alkaline phosphatase buffer). The membranes were developed by incubation in alkaline phosphatase buffer containing nitro blue tetrazolium (330 μg/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (165 μg/ml). Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and N-terminally His-tagged human mtDNA helicase (FrIV; 1.5 μg, 0.12 μm as hexamer). The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 24 °C in the absence or presence of 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ADP, 2 mm ATP, or 2 mm ATPγS as indicated. In the experiment shown in Fig. 7, reactions contained 0.25 μm heat-denatured, DNaseI-activated calf thymus DNA. In the experiment shown in Fig. 8, reactions contained 0.1, 0.4, and 2 μm heat-denatured, DNaseI-activated calf thymus DNA as indicated. Trypsin was added to reactions at a helicase: trypsin ratio of 1:1 unless indicated otherwise, followed by incubation for 10 min at 24 °C. Digestions were stopped by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor at a trypsin:soybean trypsin inhibitor ratio of 1:2. Digestion products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by silver staining.FIGURE 8Trypsin digestion of the human mtDNA helicase bound to DNA reveals a proteolytically sensitive conformation. Human mtDNA helicase was proteolyzed with trypsin at 100 mm NaCl at 24 °C using molar ratios of hexamer: DNA of 1:1, 1:3, and 1:16. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining.

(25Wang Y. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The recombinant human mtDNA helicase is a soluble, stable enzyme at 330 mm NaCl (1Ziebarth T.D. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, solubility is decreased dramatically when the salt concentration is reduced to the physiological range, either by simple dilution or dialysis. To identify factors that might stabilize the enzyme at moderate (150 mm NaCl) and low (100 mm NaCl) salt concentrations, we incubated the protein at different temperatures under various conditions, and examined its stability by evaluating recovery in the soluble fraction following centrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the absence of Mg2+ or nucleotide at moderate salt, increased temperatures in the range of 4−37 °C enhance the recovery of soluble protein whereas at low salt, we observe complete insolubility (Fig. 1, A–C). With increased temperatures, the presence of Mg2+ increases the solubility of the enzyme at both salt concentrations, and stability is increased further with the addition of ATP. ADP appears to have no significant effect. At low ionic strength, we found the greatest effect of temperature on solubility in the presence of Mg2+ and the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, ATPγS. Together the results indicate that in a physiological ionic environment, the human mtDNA helicase is most stable when nucleoside triphosphate is bound but not hydrolyzed. To investigate the oligomeric state of the human mtDNA helicase in the presence or absence of cofactors and DNA under low salt conditions, we used glutaraldehyde cross-linking followed by SDS-PAGE (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 2). In the absence of glutaraldehyde and cofactors (lane 1), we observed predominantly monomers but also a stable dimeric form of the protein that is resistant to denaturing conditions. The addition of glutaraldehyde in the absence of cofactors also yields only soluble monomers and dimers, but results in an increase in aggregation that promotes protein loss, which is consistent with the results we obtained in the solubility assay. In contrast, the inclusion of both Mg2+ and ATP or ATPγS prior to cross-linking results in a decrease in aggregation and an increase in protein recovery, again consistent with the solubility assay. Here we observe oligomeric species ranging from dimers to hexamers, and demonstrate for the first time a heptameric form of the human protein (lane 2). Based on our earlier hydrodynamic studies, the starting material is expected to be hexameric (not distinguishing hexamers/heptamers, (1Ziebarth T.D. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)), so it is likely that the smaller species observed in this analysis result from incompletely cross-linked hexamers/heptamers. The presence of DNA in glutaraldehyde cross-linking, either in the presence or absence of cofactors under the various reactions described in Fig. 1, shows no effect on the oligomeric state of the enzyme (lane 3). We examined further the effects of cofactors using velocity sedimentation. As we observed previously (1Ziebarth T.D. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the mtDNA helicase sediments in high yield in a single peak in the presence of 330 mm NaCl, with a sedimentation coefficient of 13.7 S (Fig. 3). Sedimentation of the enzyme under low salt conditions (100 mm NaCl) in the absence of cofactors resulted in very poor yields, with insoluble, aggregated material found in the gradient pellet (data not shown). However, inclusion of Mg2+ and ATPγS reproducibly results in the appearance of a single peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 16.1 S. Similarly, gel filtration of the enzyme at 330 mm NaCl produces a single peak with a Stokes radius of 80 Å. Gel filtration at 100 mm NaCl and in the presence of Mg2+ and ATPγS results in a single peak with a Stokes radius of 84 Å (Fig. 3). Combining the sedimentation coefficient with the Stokes radius for the enzyme at 330 mm NaCl yields a native molecular mass of 427,000 daltons that is similar to the value previously reported (1Ziebarth T.D. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The same calculation performed for the mtDNA helicase in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, Mg2+, and ATPγS gives a native molecular mass of 528,000 daltons. The combined increases in sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radius suggest that the protein exists in a different oligomeric state when bound to ATPγS. This estimated native molecular weight corresponds to that of a heptamer.FIGURE 3Velocity sedimentation and gel filtration of the human mtDNA helicase in the absence and presence of cofactors. Left, N- and C-terminally His-tagged human mtDNA helicase were sedimented in a 12–30% glycerol gradient as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein standards run in parallel gradients were: jack bean urease (URE, 18.6 S), bovine liver catalase (CAT, 11.3 S), and rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 7.3 S). 330 mm NaCl (open circles); 100 mm NaCl in the presence of Mg2+-ATPγS (closed circles).

A total of 4,900 front view particles were extracted from electron micrographs of negatively stained material prepared in 100 mm NaC1 in the presence of 4 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm ATPγS. This set of images was aligned and classified using the maximum-likelihood two-dimensional method (ML2D, (29Scheres S.H. Valle M. Nuñez R. Sorzano C.O. Marabini R. Herman G.T. Carazo J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar)) designed to analyze structural heterogeneity of macromolecular complexes. All the classes obtained showed images with a clear 7-fold-symmetry, indicating that this was the predominant form in the image population. A representative averaged image is shown in Fig. 4. The same result was obtained using another classification algorithm based on self-organizing maps of image rotational spectra (SOM, Refs. 30Pascual-Montano A. Donate L.E. Valle M. Bárcena M.

J. 1994; 66: 1804-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), (supplemental Fig. S1). These two-dimensional analyses indicated that the human mtDNA helicase at 100 mm NaCl in the presence of ATPγS is very homogeneous in structural terms. The most characteristic view (also referred to in this work as the “top view”) clearly presents a closed ring with a very pronounced 7-fold symmetry. The ring has an outer ring diameter of 12 nm and an inner channel of ∼1 nm inner diameter that is accessible to the negative staining agent. 4,144 top views were used in the analysis of the human mtDNA helicase at 150 mm in the presence of 4 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm ATPγS. Both ML2D (Fig. 5) and SOM classification (supplemental Fig. S2) showed a mixture of 7- and 6-fold particles with seven and six density lobes, respectively, organized in a ring. These results indicate that at 150 mm NaCl in the presence of cofactors, the human mtDNA helicase exists as a mixture of two conformations with 6- and 7-fold symmetry. Both methods detected a significant population of tilted or rocking particles, those without defined monomers in ML2D and those with a main component in the harmonic one or two of the rotational spectra. For these particles, it is not possible to determine the exact number of monomers, and for that reason, we cannot quantify precisely the percentage of each of the two classes present in the sample. A set of 4,317 images was utilized to analyze the structure of the human mtDNA helicase at 330 mm NaCl. The classification of these images using ML2D (Fig. 6A) and SOM (supplemental Fig. S3) clearly indicated that the sample exhibited a much larger degree of structural flexibility than the samples analyzed under the low salt conditions. Because of the high degree of structural heterogeneity, the quality of the averaged image obtained"

Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and the mitochondrial localized fraction of CuZn-superoxide dismutase (Sod1) use copper as an essential cofactor.

Biol. 2008; 28: 4354-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A recent systematic analysis of the twin Cx9C protein family identified a total of 14 mitochondrial proteins, which absence produce heterogeneous effects not only in cytochrome c oxidase activity but also in cytochrome c reductase activity (20Longen S. Bien M. Bihlmaier K. Kloeppel C. Kauff F. Hammermeister M. Westermann B. Herrmann J.M. Riemer J. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although no physical interactions among these proteins have been detected to date, several pieces of information obtained in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest that at least some of them could be part of a copper transfer pathway toward COX. The respiratory deficiency of a cox23 null mutant is rescued by copper supplementation, albeit only with concomitant overexpression of COX17 (21Barros M.H. Johnson A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31943-31947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recombinant Cox19 binds copper (17Rigby K. Zhang L. Cobine P.A. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10233-10242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but the COX assembly defect of a cox19 null mutant strain is not rescued by copper supplementation (22Nobrega M.P. Bandeira S.C. Beers J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40206-40211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cox19 was proposed to participate in a different part of the Cox23-Cox17 pathway (21Barros M.H. Johnson A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31943-31947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown whether Pet191 binds copper but the respiratory defect of Δpet191 cells is not rescued by exogenous copper and therefore Pet191 has not been linked to a role in mitochondrial copper metabolism (18Khalimonchuk O. Rigby K. Bestwick M. Pierrel F. Cobine P.A. Winge D.R. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Concerning Cmc1, we have recently shown that the recombinant form has the ability to bind copper (19Horn D. Al-Ali H. Barrientos A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4354-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Differently from Δcox17, Δcox23, Δcox19, and Δpet191 cells, which display a complete absence of COX, Δcmc1 cells retain ∼40% of COX wild-type levels. The Δcmc1 respiratory defect is rescued by copper supplementation (19Horn D. Al-Ali H. Barrientos A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4354-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have proposed that Cmc1 could be acting in the same pathway as Cox19 and Cox23 (3Horn D. Barrientos A. IUBMB Life. 2008; 60: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). How copper distribution from the matrix pool toward COX and Sod1 is regulated also remains largely unexplored. We have reported that Cmc1 levels modulate copper delivery to mitochondrial Sod1 (19Horn D. Al-Ali H. Barrientos A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4354-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which support a model of Cmc1 as a gatekeeper allocating copper to the two pathways leading to the metallation of COX and Sod1. Because Δcmc1 cells retain a significant amount of COX activity we had speculated that Cmc1 function could either be redundant or to modulate the function of another protein(s). Therefore, to better understand the role of Cmc1 as a COX biogenetic factor and as a copper gatekeeper within the mitochondrial IMS, we aimed to identify close homologues and functional partners of this protein. Here, we describe the characterization of Cmc2, a conserved Cx9C protein, the BLAST reciprocal best match of Cmc1. In S. cerevisiae, Cmc2 is encoded by open reading frame YBL059C-A, whose deletion leads to a complete loss of COX and an increase in activated Sod1. Cmc2 physically interacts with Cmc1 and both proteins have non-overlapping cooperative functions. Data obtained in C. elegans and cultured human cell lines support the functional conservation of Cmc2 during evolution. We propose that Cmc2, acting together with Cmc1, regulates copper distribution toward COX, which affects the level of active mitochondrial Sod1. Most S. cerevisiae strains used were all in the W303 background and included the wild-type W303-1A (MATa ade2-1 his3-1,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1) and the previously reported mutant Δcox14 (23Barrientos A. Zambrano A. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3472-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Mutant Δcmc2 cells were created by inserting a URA3 cassette in the gene YBL059C-A locus in yeast chromosome II. The URA3 gene and flanking sequences of the CMC2 gene were PCR amplified using primers: 5′-CTGTTTGGACTTCATCAATGCACTCGATAAATGCCATCAAAAGGAATATTACAAGAGAATATTTGGCCTAAATTTGTAGAGGACTCAG-3′ and 5′-GCGTACTGTCTATCTAAGATAGTCTTTAATATAGCGTCCTCGCCATATTCTTCTTCCTTAGTTTTGCTGGCCGCATC-3′. The amplicon was transformed into a W303-1A wild-type strain to create W303Δcmc2. The Δcmc2Δcox14 double mutant was obtained from crosses of the respective single mutants. A Δcmc1 mutant in the BY4741 background was previously reported (19Horn D. Al-Ali H. Barrientos A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4354-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The growth medium compositions have been described elsewhere (24Myers A.M. Pape L.K. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Endogenous cell respiration was assayed in whole cells in the presence of galactose at 24 °C using a Clark-type polarographic oxygen electrode from Hansatech Instruments (Norfolk, United Kingdom) (25Barrientos A. Korr D. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The specific activities reported were corrected for KCN-insensitive respiration. Mitochondria were prepared from strains grown in medium containing 2% galactose, according to the method of Faye et al. (26Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) except that zymolyase 20T (ICN Biochemicals Inc., Aurora, OH) instead of glusulase was used for the conversion of cells to spheroplasts. Mitochondria prepared from the different strains were used for spectrophotometric assays carried out at 24 °C to measure KCN-sensitive COX activity and antimycin A-sensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase (NCCR), succinate cytochrome c reductase, and ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase activities were measured as described (25Barrientos A. Korr D. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). NADH dehydrogenase was measured by monitoring the diphenyliodonium chloride (0.5 mm)-sensitive oxidation of NADH at 340 nm. Total mitochondrial cytochromes spectra were obtained as reported (27Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sedimentation properties of Cmc2 and Cmc2–3HA in sucrose gradients were analyzed as described (23Barrientos A. Zambrano A. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3472-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We have used the services of Open Biosystems/Thermo Scientific (Huntsville, AL) to generate affinity purified rabbit polyclonal peptide antibodies against Cmc1 (peptide, DEKYLDGERDKIVLEKINK) and Cmc2 (peptide, EEYGEDAILKTILDRQYAKK). Intronless CMC2 sequence was obtained using the RT-PCR Introductory System kit (Promega). The sequence containing the CMC2 gene was cloned using SacII and KpnI restriction enzymes into the pET41b protein expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), which provided an N-terminal GST affinity tag. A PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) cleavage site was introduced between the GST tag and CMC2 for removal of the tag. The protein expression vector was transformed into the BL21 Star protein expression strain of E. coli (Invitrogen). Cells were initially grown overnight in 5 ml of Luria broth (LB) containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Starter cultures were then diluted into 500 ml of minimal phosphate medium with antibiotic and grown with shaking (250 rpm) at 37 °C until OD of 0.8, then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 20 min and subsequently lysed by resuspension in 10 ml of lysis buffer/g of cells (20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) containing additional DNase I (0.1 mg/ml). The cells were lysed using a EmulsiFlex®-C3 high pressure homogenizer (Avestin, Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada), and particulates were removed from the lysate by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 × g in an SS-34 Sorvall rotor. The soluble E. coli lysate containing the GST-Cmc2 recombinant fusion construct was directly loaded by fast protein liquid chromatography (1 ml/min) onto a 10-ml GSTrap FF affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated at 4 °C in 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol. The column was subsequently washed until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to baseline. The GST-Cmc2 protein was eluted with GST elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm GSH, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Chromatographic fractions (1 ml) containing the designated fusion protein were detected by absorbance at 280 nm and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing recombinant protein were pooled and subjected to a desalting column for buffer exchange into 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine. The desalted protein was incubated with 1 unit/mg of PreScission Protease overnight at 4 °C to cleave off the GST tag. After incubation with the protease, separation of cleaved and non-cleaved recombinant protein was performed by passing the sample on a 10-ml GSTrap FF affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) and collecting the flow-through, and the sample was subsequently concentrated and loaded onto a Hiload Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) gel-filtration column, equilibrated in the same buffer. High purity Cmc2 was subsequently collected from the appropriate fractions and concentrated as needed. To quantify Sod1 activity in whole cells and isolated mitochondria, we used an in-gel assay as described (28Flohé L. Otting F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). To quantify the SOD activity staining gel, the images were digitalized and densitometric analyses was performed using the histogram function of the Adobe Photoshop program. Standard nematode culturing techniques were employed (29the Community of C. elegans Researchers Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The N2 (wild type) and NL2099 (rrf-3(pk1426) II) were used. The cmc-2 (C35D10.17) bacterial feeding RNAi construct was generated ab initio (corresponding to the spliced coding region of genomic fragment III: 4867025–4867432 bp). A full-length cDNA fragment (333 bp long), homologue to the yeast gene CMC2, was amplified by reverse transcription from wild-type N2 total RNA with specific primers carrying the PstI and ApaI restriction sites (forward, 5′-cttctctgcagatgcttccggatttgtct-3′ and reverse, 5′-cttctgggcccttctaaattttacatcctt-3′) and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pL4440 (FireLab, Addgene). The construct was verified by direct sequencing. The pL4440 vector was used as a negative control and pLT61.1 (FireLab, Addgene), a pL4440-derived plasmid carrying the unc-22 gene, was employed as control of proper double-stranded RNA expression as its silencing produces a visible phenotype. RNAi was carried out by feeding as described previously (30Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Gene. 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 31Kamath R.S. Martinez-Campos M. Zipperlen P. Fraser A.G. Ahringer J. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (RESEARCH0002)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures of HT115(DE3) containing the empty vector (pL4440), pLT61.1, or the gene of interest were prepared in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 13 μg/ml of tetracycline and grown overnight at 37 °C. Bacteria lawns were prepared by adding 300 μl of a stationary overnight culture to a 10-cm RNAi plate (NMG agar supplemented with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 100 μg/ml of ampicillin, and 13 μg/ml of tetracycline) and growing overnight at 37 °C. One-day-old gravid adult rrf-3(pk1426) hermaphrodites were transferred from standard OP50 culture plates to each type of RNAi plate and allowed to lay eggs at 20 °C. Animals were grown on RNAi plates for three consecutive generations as described previously (32Rea S.L. Ventura N. Johnson T.E. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e259Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). For COX histochemistry, synchronized silenced worms were harvested and cuticles were permeabilized for histochemical staining as described (33Xie G. Jia Y. Aamodt E. Genet. Anal. 1995; 12: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). COX staining was performed as reported by Grad et al. (34Grad L.I. Sayles L.C. Lemire B.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Control reactions were incubated in the presence of 10 mm KCN to inhibit complex IV activity. Stained worms were centrifuged for 10 s (360 × g) and the supernatant was removed. The worm pellet was washed three times for 5 min in phosphate buffer. Stained animals were mounted and photographed with an automated Leica microscope. Standard procedures were used for the preparation and ligation of DNA fragments, and for transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA from E. coli (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast were transformed by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (36Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). The one-step gene insertion method (37Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) was used to integrate linear plasmids at the URA3 or LEU2 locus of yeast nuclear DNA. Protein concentration was measured with Folin phenol reagent (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using the buffer system of Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar), and Western blots were treated with antibodies against the appropriate proteins followed by a second reaction with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). The SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) was used for the final detection. All experiments (enzymatic and respiratory assays) were done at least in triplicate. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of absolute values or percent of control. The values obtained for wild-type and cmc2 mutant strain for the different parameters studied were compared by Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. The open reading frame YBL059C-A in yeast chromosome II codes for the BLAST reciprocal best match of Cmc1 (Fig. 1A). For this reason the gene encoded by YBL059C-A was named CMC2. Cmc2 contains a twin Cx9C motif and shares 23% of identical residues and 50% similarity with Cmc1 (Fig. 1A). We have constructed a W303-1A strain carrying a null cmc2 allele by substituting the entire YBL059C-A reading frame with an URA3 cassette. This strain (W303Δcmc2) is unable to utilize respiratory substrates for growth (Fig. 1B) due to a virtually complete abolishment of the cells capacity to respire as shown by a polarographic measurement of KCN-sensitive endogenous cell respiration (Fig. 1C). The ability of the mutant cells to respire was restored by reinsertion of recombinant CMC2 but not by overexpression of CMC1 (Fig. 1B) suggesting that the two proteins perform different functions. To ascertain whether the origin of the respiratory defect stemmed from a defect in the respiratory chain enzymes, we analyzed the oxidized minus reduced total mitochondrial cytochrome spectra. Comparison of the wild-type and mutant spectra revealed slight differences in the levels of cytochromes b, c, or c1. More importantly, cytochromes a and a3 were absent in the Δcmc2 mutant compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 2A) indicating a complete COX impairment. The enzymatic defect was confirmed by measuring COX activity in isolated mitochondria, which indicated a complete absence of functional COX in the mutant as compared with the isogenic wild-type (Fig. 2B). Steady-state levels of Cox1 and Cox2 were not detected in the mutant and those of Cox3 were significantly reduced. This is most likely due to the rapid turnover of the COX catalytic core subunits when the assembly process is hindered. A less significant difference was detected in the more stable nuclear-encoded subunits, such as Cox4 (Fig. 2C). In addition to abolishing COX biogenesis, the Δcmc2 mutation produces several pleiotropic effects in other segments of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (see below), whereas the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity in the mutant was similar to the wild-type (not shown). Cytochrome spectra showed that the amount of cytochrome b appeared decreased and the amount of cytochrome c increased. To distinguish between cytochromes c and c1, mitochondria were treated with high salt to remove cytochrome c. Spectra of the salt extracts (Fig. 2A) showed an increase in cytochrome c in Δcmc2 cells. Steady-state levels of cytochrome c were found slightly increased consistent with the spectra data (Fig. 2C). A similar increase has been observed in other COX assembly mutants including Δshy1 (40Mashkevich G. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14356-14364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Additionally, the Δcmc2 mutant showed decreased steady-state levels of some bc1 complex subunits (Fig. 2C) and a consistent decrease of ∼20–45% in several enzymatic assays involving the bc1 complex (Fig. 2B). A similar pleiotropic effect has been previously reported for strains carrying null alleles of cox10 (35% decreased NCCR activity (41Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cox20 (20% decreased NCCR activity (42Hell K. Tzagoloff A. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 2008; 28: 4354-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), NCCR activity was found 2-fold increased. The heterogeneous effects on COX and NCCR activities resulting from the absence of 14 mitochondrial Cx9C proteins were also recently reported (20Longen S. Bien M. Bihlmaier K. Kloeppel C. Kauff F. Hammermeister M. Westermann B. Herrmann J.M. Riemer J. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying these pleiotropic effects remains uncharacterized and is currently being investigated in our laboratory. An initial experiment to discern the primary target of Cmc2 is reported in Fig. 2D. We and others have recently reported that antioxidant treatment enhances mitochondrial biogenesis (43Soto I.C.

We have found that suppression of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) in human microvascular endothelial cells increases CD14 gene expression compared to untreated or siControl (siCtrl)-treated conditions. Following LPS treatment, GPx-1 deficiency augmented LPS-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, CD14 expression, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNA and protein expression compared to LPS-treated control cells. GPx-1 deficiency also transiently augmented LPS-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression. Adenoviral overexpression of GPx-1 significantly diminished LPS-mediated responses in adhesion molecule expression. Consistent with these findings, LPS responses were also greater in endothelial cells derived from GPx-1-knockout mice, whereas adhesion molecule expression was decreased in cells from GPx-1-overexpressing transgenic mice. Knockdown of CD14 attenuated LPS-mediated up-regulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA and protein, and it mitigated the effects of GPx-1 deficiency on LPS-induced adhesion molecule expression. Taken together, these data suggest that GPx-1 modulates the endothelial cell response to LPS, in part, by altering CD14-mediated effects."
https://openalex.org/W2116516435,"The N-terminal part of the calcium-regulated and phospholipid-binding protein annexin AI contains peptide sequences with pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. We have earlier shown that a proinflammatory signal triggered by one of these peptides, Gln9–Lys25, is mediated by FPR1, a member of the formyl peptide receptor family expressed in human neutrophils. To determine the core structure in Gln9–Lys25, smaller peptides were generated, and their capacity to activate neutrophils was determined. A peptide spanning from amino acid Glu14 to Lys25 was inactive, whereas the activity was retained in the Gln9–Tyr20 peptide. Removal of amino acids from the C and N terminus of Gln9–Tyr20 revealed that the first amino acid (Gln9) was of the utmost importance for activity. The core structure that activated the neutrophil NADPH oxidase to release superoxide anions was Gln9-Ala10-Trp11-Phe12. This peptide also inhibited the activity induced by N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe and WKYMVM. A structural model of the peptide agonist-FPR1 complex suggests that the transmembrane part of the binding pocket of the receptor binds optimally to a tetrapeptide. According to the model and the results presented, the N-terminal amino acid glutamine in Gln9–Phe12 is located close to the bottom of the binding cleft, leaving for steric reasons insufficient space to extend the peptide at the N terminus.

The most studied human neutrophil GPCR is FPR1 (formyl peptide receptor 1), a chemoattractant receptor that binds several peptide agonists that are either endogenous or derived from microbial pathogens. The biological effects induced by these agonists can be mimicked by synthetic peptides (1Ye R.D. Boulay F. Wang J.M. Dahlgren C. Gerard C. Parmentier M. Serhan C.N. Murphy P.M. Pharmacol.

One of the important differences between FPR1 and a closely related receptor, FPR2, belonging to the same receptor family, is that the latter is a low affinity receptor for fMLF, and this affinity difference has been exploited to identify which amino acid residues are involved in binding of formylated peptides (6Miettinen H.M. Mills J.S. Gripentrog J.M. Dratz E.A. Granger B.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4045-4054PubMed Google Scholar). FPR1 is a promiscuous receptor, and non-formylated proteins and peptides that are structurally distinct from fMLF have been shown to trigger phagocyte function via FPR1 (1Ye R.D. Boulay F. Wang J.M.

Biochimie. 2007; 89: 1089-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Several peptides derived from the N-terminal domain of human annexin I are ligands for FPR1 and for FPR2 and FPR3, the two other members of the FPR family in myeloid cells (7Karlsson J. Fu H.

The C-terminal domain of the annexins is highly conserved and mediates the calcium-regulated binding of the protein to membranes, whereas the unique N-terminal part defines the precise function of the protein. In annexin I, the N terminus is sensitive to cleavage by endogenous proteases (12Movitz C. Dahlgren C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1468: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 13Vong L. D'Acquisto F. Pederzoli-Ribeil M. Lavagno L. Flower R.J. Witko-Sarsat V. Perretti M. J. Biol.

Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 574-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An N-terminally acetylated annexin I peptide corresponding to the sequence Gln9–Lys25 has been shown to mediate both activating and inhibitory effects on neutrophil function (7Karlsson J. Fu H. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. Hellstrand K. Movitz C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2005; 78: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Walther A. Riehemann K. Gerke V. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 831-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This study aimed at identifying the core structure within the Gln9–Lys25 annexin I peptide that activates FPR1. Our results suggest that neutrophil activation is strictly mediated by the acetylated Gln9-Ala10-Trp11-Phe12 (Gln9–Phe12) sequence. In addition, we have generated a computational homology model of this peptide in complex with FPR1, based on the rhodopsin crystal structure, to interpret the biological outcome and to suggest new peptide variants for testing. Dextran was from Amersham Biosciences, and Ficoll-Paque was from GE Healthcare. The annexin AI-derived peptides were synthesized and HPLC-purified by Ross-Petersen ApS (Holte, Denmark), dissolved in alkaline phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −70 °C. The hexapeptide Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-Met-NH2 (WKYMVM) was synthesized and HPLC-purified by Alta Bioscience (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK). The formylated peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF), phorbol myristate acetate, and N-t-butoxycarbonyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (Boc-MLF) were from Sigma. The FPR2 antagonist WRWWWW (15Bae Y.S.

These agonists/antagonists were dissolved in DMSO to 10−2 m and stored at −70 °C until used. Cyclosporin H was kindly provided by Novartis Pharma (Basel, Switzerland) and diluted in DMSO to 10−3 m and stored at −70 °C. Horseradish peroxidase was from Roche Applied Science. Luminol was purchased from Sigma. Structure models of FPR1 were created using the crystal structure of the bovine rhodopsin receptor (Protein Data Bank code 1u19) (16Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). A multiple sequence alignment containing structure-determined GPCRs and selected amine receptors was manually adjusted, and pairwise sequence alignments for the modeling target and structure templates were extracted (supplemental Fig. 1). A homology model was built using the standard tool of the program ICM (17Abagyan R. Totrov M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) (Molsoft LLC, La Jolla, CA), which includes loop modeling by a library template search, followed by geometry optimization of the loop. The side chains of non-conserved residues were optimized using Monte Carlo sampling. The Ac-AQWF peptide (Gln9–Phe12) was built and merged with the homology model, with the acetylated N terminus positioned near the bottom of the binding pocket. The extracellular loop between helices 4 and 5 was removed (residues Arg163–Ile191) to avoid steric clashes with the peptide while maintaining the majority of the proposed binding site residues. A number of complex structures were generated by means of torsion space biased probability Monte Carlo structure optimization (17Abagyan R. Totrov M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) of the peptide, with the all-atom receptor model replaced by potential energy maps representing van der Waals, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions (ICM version 3.5 manual). This method is aimed at broad sampling of conformational space, meaning that many different binding modes are explored. Therefore, we biased the optimizations by the introduction of a weak harmonic constraint between the N-terminal α-carbons of the simulated and manually docked ligands to increase sampling efficiency. Several alternative low energy solutions were inspected, and those that best matched available binding data were selected for further analysis. Neutrophil granulocytes were isolated from buffy coats obtained from healthy adults by dextran sedimentation at 1 × g, centrifugation in a Ficoll-Paque gradient, and hypotonic lysis of remaining erythrocytes (18Böyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 1968; 97: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). The neutrophils were washed twice and resuspended (1 × 107 cells/ml) in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing glucose (10 mm), Ca2+ (1 mm), and Mg2+ (1.5 mm) (KRG; pH 7.3) and stored on melting ice until used. The stable expression of FPR1 and FPR2 in undifferentiated HL-60 cells has been described elsewhere (19Dahlgren C. Christophe T. Boulay F. Madianos P.N. Rabiet M.J. Karlsson A. Blood. 2000; 95: 1810-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Christophe T. Karlsson A. Dugave C. Rabiet M.J. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium/glutaMax I, and the maximal density was maintained below 2 × 106 cells/ml. The control experiments with the specific agonists (fMLF for FPR1 and WKYMVM for FPR2) were performed at each experimental event and turned out positive. Neutrophil production and release of superoxide anions was measured by a luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence assay (21Lundqvist H. Dahlgren C. Free Radic Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The chemiluminescence activity was measured in a six-channel Biolumat LB 9505 apparatus (Berthold Co., Wildbad, Germany), using disposable 4-ml polypropylene tubes with a 500-μl reaction mixture containing neutrophils (5 × 105 cells), horseradish peroxidase (4 units), and luminol (20 μm). A volume of 50 μl of cyclosporin H (10 μm) or WRWWWW (5 μm) was added as indicated under “Results.” The measuring tubes were equilibrated for 5 min at 37 °C, and the cells were activated by the addition of one or two agonists at different time points. The concentration of fMLF and WKYMVM was 1 × 10−7 M. In some experiments the concentration for fMLF and WKYMVM was titrated to give the same peak response as 50 μm Gln9–Tyr20 (Ac-QAWFIENEEQEY). The light emission was recorded continuously. Cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the instructions given by the manufacturer. Calcium measurements were carried out as described earlier (20Christophe T. Karlsson A. Dugave C. Rabiet M.J. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) using a LC50 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences model LS50B). Intracellular calcium concentrations were calculated using the formula, [Ca2+]i = Kd(F − Fmin)/(Fmax − F) with a Kd for Fura-2 of 224 nm, where Fmax is the fluorescence in the presence of 0.04% Triton X-100 and Fmin is the fluorescence after the addition of 5 mm EGTA and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. A two-tailed paired Student's t test was performed to determine statistical significance. A p value of <0.05 was regarded as significant. The peptide Gln9–Lys25 (Ac-QAWFIENEEQEYVQTVK), corresponding to amino acids 9–25 in the N terminus of annexin AI, activates the neutrophil NADPH oxidase primarily by interaction with FPR1 (7Karlsson J. Fu H. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. Hellstrand K. Movitz C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2005; 78: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two truncated peptides were synthesized from this sequence and assessed for neutrophil-activating properties. A peptide spanning amino acids Glu14–Lys25 (Ac-ENEEQEYVQTVK) showed no activating or inhibitory effect on neutrophil superoxide anion production (data not shown). A peptide from amino acid Gln9 to Tyr20 (Ac-QAWFIENEEQEY) induced a rapid and pronounced release of superoxide with peak activation at 1 min, after which the response rapidly declined (Fig. 1A); the kinetics of this response thus was similar to that induced by the annexin I peptide Gln9–Lys25 and other chemotactic peptides, such as fMLF (7Karlsson J. Fu H. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. Hellstrand K. Movitz C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2005; 78: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The activity of Gln9–Tyr20 was concentration-dependent with maximal activity at around 50 μm. The receptor involved was identified using transfected HL60 cells selectively expressing FPR1 or FPR2. The Gln9–Tyr20 peptide induced a distinct increase in intracellular calcium in FPR1-expressing cells (Fig. 1B), whereas only a minimal response was induced in FPR2-expressing cells (Fig. 1C), thus implying that the Gln9–Tyr20 peptide activates neutrophils preferentially via FPR1. This was confirmed using receptor-specific antagonists; the FPR1 antagonist Boc-MLF inhibited the Gln9–Tyr20-induced response (Fig. 2A, first arrow, dotted and gray lines), whereas the FPR2-specific antagonist WRWWWW (W5) was ineffective (Fig. 2B, first arrow, dotted and gray lines). The receptor specificity was also determined in desensitization experiments using the FPR1 agonist fMLF and the FPR2 agonist WKYMVM together with receptor-specific antagonists. The neutrophil response to fMLF (Fig. 2, B (second arrow, black and dotted lines) and C) and WKYMVM (Fig. 2, A (second arrow, black and dotted lines) and C) was strongly reduced when the cells had first been challenged with Gln9–Tyr20. The FPR2-specific antagonist WRWWWW (W5) could not reverse the inhibitory effects of Gln9–Tyr20 on the fMLF-induced response (Fig. 2, B (gray and dotted lines) and D), suggesting that the receptor is down-regulated by homologous desensitization. In contrast, the state of desensitization to WKYMVM was reversed by the FPR1 antagonist Boc-MLF (Fig. 2, A and D), indicating that the binding of Gln9–Tyr20 to FPR1 also induces a heterologous desensitization of FPR2 that can be blocked by an FPR1 antagonist. The FPR1 agonist activity of the Gln9-Tyr20 peptide, in contrast to the Glu14–Lys25 peptide, suggests that the N terminus is critical for receptor interaction. This was verified using shorter peptides generated by a stepwise removal of amino acids. The 4-amino acid peptide Gln9–Phe12 (Ac-QAWF) was the shortest peptide that retained both the capacity to trigger a neutrophil NADPH oxidase response and to inhibit the activity induced by another FPR1 agonist (i.e. fMLF) or an FPR2 agonist (i.e. WKYMVM) (Fig. 3, A and B). Variants of this peptide were used for further characterization of the ligand-receptor interaction. Five GPCRs have been crystallized to date: bovine (22Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A.

Their ligand binding sites for retinal and catecholamines are located near the extracellular side of the transmembrane (TM) region and engage mainly residues in helices 3, 5, and 6. The same region has been proposed to be critical for peptide binding, and additional binding regions are plausible, considering that tetrameric peptides are substantially larger. Miettinen et al. (6Miettinen H.M. Mills J.S. Gripentrog J.M. Dratz E.A. Granger B.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4045-4054PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested 10 amino acids of FPR1 to be important for high affinity binding of fMLF. These authors also presented a model in which these residues were located in positions below the second extracellular loop (ECL2), which coincides with the bottom of the binding pocket for retinal rhodopsin (22Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar) as well as for several ligands that bind aminergic receptors (27Cherezov V. Rosenbaum D.M. Hanson M.A. Rasmussen S.G. Thian F.S. Kobilka T.S. Choi H.J. Kuhn P. Weis W.I. Kobilka B.K. Stevens R.C. Science. 2007; 318: 1258-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (2787) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the region below the ECL2 is of importance for the contact between peptide ligands and the receptor. We generated several models of FPR1 with docked peptides and used these to interpret our experimental data. Homology models of FPR1 were based on the bovine rhodopsin crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1u19) (16Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), which has a sequence identity of 20% for 348 aligned residues corresponding to the full transmembrane domain. The ECL2 blocks to a large extent the binding pocket of the receptor. This loop and the N-terminal region preceding helix TM1 were excluded in the model in order to allow docking of the peptide into the binding pocket. The fact that there are large sequence variations and a structural variability in ECL2 among the different GPCRs suggests that it is difficult to predict the conformation of this region. This is also illustrated by the fact that the ECL2 region in bovine rhodopsin forms two β-strands that are part of a β-sheet and that the corresponding segment in amine receptors forms a single helix located on top of the helix bundle. Due to these difficulties, the ECL2 region was not modeled. The peptide model for the acetylated core annexin I peptide, Gln9–Phe12, was docked to potential maps that represented van der Waals, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic properties of FPR1 (lacking the ECL2). We assumed that the acetylated N terminus of the annexin peptide was bound in the most buried part of the binding pocket near Asp106 in the receptor, based on the observation that modifications of the peptide N terminus had obvious effects on peptide binding in our functional studies. Glutamine Gln9 was restrained to this region by means of a harmonic restraint. Only limited structure optimization was employed because the model was expected to be of lower resolution due to low sequence identity with the template, the clear difference in ligand properties, and the lack of detailed structural information for peptide receptors. In the ensemble of energetically most favored solutions, Gln9 interacts with a cavity near Asp106 in TM3 and forms an extended structure that points toward Arg201 in TM5 and the extracellular ends of helices TM3 and TM4 (Fig. 4, C and B). This places the peptide C terminus near the extracellular side of the transmembrane region. Because cross-linking data indicated the proximity of the peptide to Lys85 in TM2 (28Quehenberger O. Prossnitz E.R. Cavanagh S.L. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18167-18175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mills J.S. Miettinen H.M. Barnidge D. Vlases M.J. Wimer-Mackin S. Dratz E.A. Sunner J. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10428-10435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we reviewed the Monte Carlo geometry optimization data and found solutions of slightly higher energy that did include interactions between Lys85 and the C-terminal carboxylic acid (Fig. 4A). The direction of the extended peptide was more tilted toward the membrane plane than the other solution, allowing for the ECL2 to fold down onto regions close to TM3 and TM4 that are occupied by the peptide in the other solution. Several residues that affect ligand binding upon mutation were in contact with the peptide. Although the exact location of the peptide could not be predicted, the model suggests that the tetrapeptide length matches the distance from Asp106 to the extracellular termini of transmembrane helices, meaning that this is the optimal length for interaction with the transmembrane domain and that few interactions occur with the extracellular loop regions. As mentioned, the Gln9–Phe12 (Ac-QAWF) peptide was the shortest peptide possessing the capacity both to trigger a neutrophil NADPH oxidase response and to inhibit the activity induced by other FPR agonists (Fig. 3, A and B). According to earlier published data on ligand interaction with FPR1, the annexin I peptide most probably interacts with the amino acids near the extracellular side of the transmembrane domain that have been proposed to form a binding pocket in FPR1 (6Miettinen H.M. Mills J.S. Gripentrog J.M. Dratz E.A. Granger B.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4045-4054PubMed Google Scholar). According to the model presented, the N-terminal amino acid glutamine in Gln9–Phe12 is located close to the bottom of the binding cleft, leaving no extra space for an additional amino acid (Fig. 4A). If this assumption is correct, it should not be possible to extend the peptide at the N-terminal end for steric reasons. This was supported by results obtained from experiments showing that a peptide containing an additional amino acid, alanine, linked to the Gln9 (Ac-AQAWF), has lost most of the capacity to activate the neutrophil NADPH oxidase (see Table 2). The results suggest that the location of Gln9 in the binding cleft of FPR1 is of pivotal importance for activation of the receptor. Interestingly, the alanine-elongated peptide retained some of the inhibitory activity, illustrated by the fact that the fMLF as well as the WKYMVM responses were reduced in cells pretreated with the peptide (Table 2). The significance of the initial Gln9 was further illustrated by the fact that the peptide Ac-AAWF in which an alanine has replaced the Gln9 had a markedly reduced activity compared with the original peptide. The inhibitory effect of Ac-AAWF was more specific in that the affect on the fMLF-induced response was retained (Fig. 3C and Table 2), whereas cells were fully responsive when triggered with the FPR2 activating peptide WKYMVM (Fig. 3D and Table 2). The N-terminal Gln9 in the synthetic annexin I peptides used was acetylated. Removal of the N-terminal acetyl group did not result in any change in the biological activity of the Gln9–Phe12 peptide (data not shown), indicating that a single perfect complementary receptor/ligand structure is not required or that receptor dynamics and/or structure rearrangements occur that are expected, considering the large variation of FPR1 ligands.TABLE 2The effect of modified annexin AI peptides on fMLF- and WKYMVM-induced respiratory burst as compared with Gln9–Phe12*ROS, reactive oxygen species.

The Ac-QWF peptide, in which the second amino acid, Ala10, had been removed, had lost the capacity to activate neutrophils but retained around 35% of its inhibitory effect on an fMLF-triggered response. This effect was also receptor-selective in that neutrophils pretreated with Ac-QWF were fully responsive to the FPR2-specific agonist WKYMVM (Table 2). The dipeptide Ac-WF, in which both the Gln9 and the Ala10 had been removed, lacked the activating properties but retained the selective inhibitory effect on the fMLF-induced respiratory burst (Fig. 3, E and F, and Table 1). The significance of the third amino acid, Trp11, in Gln9–Phe12 was investigated by deleting the amino acid or replacing it with alanine. The Ac-QAF and Ac-QAAF (as well as Ac-QA) peptides were inactive with respect to their ability to trigger a neutrophil NADPH oxidase response but also in their capacity to block activity induced by the other FPR1/FPR2 agonists (Table 2). The activity was similarly lost when the fourth amino acid, Phe12, was removed from the tetrapeptide (generating Ac-QAW), but some of the inhibitory activity was retained (Table 1). Taken together, these results indicate that all four amino acids in the Gln9–Phe12 peptide are of importance for activating FPR1 but not for blocking the receptor from binding other ligands. This supports the model where the core interactions occur via the peptide N terminus located deep in the binding pocket.TABLE 1The effect of peptides derived from annexin AI on fMLF- and WKYMVM-induced respiratory burst*ROS, reactive oxygen species.

https://openalex.org/W2156587901,"<i>Conus</i> snail (<i>Conus</i>) venoms are a valuable source of pharmacologically active compounds; some of the peptide toxin families from the snail venoms are known to interact with potassium channels. We report the purification, synthesis, and characterization of κM-conotoxin RIIIJ from the venom of a fish-hunting species, <i>Conus radiatus</i>. This conopeptide, like a previously characterized peptide in the same family, κM-RIIIK, inhibits the homotetrameric human Kv1.2 channels. When tested in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes, κM-RIIIJ has an order of magnitude higher affinity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 33 nm) to Kv1.2 than κM-RIIIK (IC<sub>50</sub> = 352 nm). Chimeras of RIIIK and RIIIJ tested on the human Kv1.2 channels revealed that Lys-9 from κM-RIIIJ is a determinant of its higher potency against hKv1.2. However, when compared in a model of ischemia/reperfusion, κM-RIIIK (100 μg/kg of body weight), administered just before reperfusion, significantly reduces the infarct size in rat hearts <i>in vivo</i> without influencing hemodynamics, providing a potential compound for cardioprotective therapeutics. In contrast, κM-RIIIJ does not exert any detectable cardioprotective effect. κM-RIIIJ shows more potency for Kv1.2-Kv1.5 and Kv1.2-Kv1.6 heterodimers than κM-RIIIK, whereas the affinity of κM-RIIIK to Kv1.2-Kv1.7 heterodimeric channels is higher (IC<sub>50</sub> = 680 nm) than that of κM-RIIIJ (IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.15 μm). Thus, the cardioprotection seems to correlate to antagonism to heteromultimeric channels, involving the Kv1.2 α-subunit rather than antagonism to Kv1.2 homotetramers. Furthermore, κM-RIIIK and κM-RIIIJ provide a valuable set of probes for understanding the underlying mechanism of cardioprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2045192469,"Tumor cells, including SW480 carcinoma cells that carry a mutant p53, are addicted to the mutant for their survival and resistance to growth suppression by chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we investigated whether various classes of p53 mutants share a common property and functional domains necessary for mutant p53 gain of function. To test this, we generated SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant R273H/P309S can be inducibly or stably knocked down, whereas a small interfering RNA-resistant mutant p53 along with a mutated functional domain can be inducibly or stably expressed. We found that both contact-site (R248W and R273H) and conformation (G245S and R249S) mutants are able to maintain the transformed phenotypes of SW480 cells conferred by endogenous mutant p53. We also found that activation domains 1–2 and the proline-rich domain are required for mutant p53 gain of function. Interestingly, we showed that the C-terminal basic domain, which is required for wild-type p53 activity, is an inhibitory domain for mutant p53. Furthermore, we showed that deletion of the basic domain enhances, whereas a mutation in activation domains 1–2 and deletion of the proline-rich domain abolish mutant p53 to regulate Gro1 and Id2, both of which are regulated by and mediate endogenous mutant p53 gain of function. These results indicate that both conformation and contact-site mutants share a property for cell transformation, and the domains critical for wild-type p53 tumor suppression are also required for mutant p53 tumor promotion. Thus, the inhibitory basic domain and the common property for p53 mutants can be explored for targeting tumors with mutant p53.

We found that both contact-site (R248W and R273H) and conformation (G245S and R249S) mutants are able to maintain the transformed phenotypes of SW480 cells conferred by endogenous mutant p53. We also found that activation domains 1–2 and the proline-rich domain are required for mutant p53 gain of function. Interestingly, we showed that the C-terminal basic domain, which is required for wild-type p53 activity, is an inhibitory domain for mutant p53. Furthermore, we showed that deletion of the basic domain enhances, whereas a mutation in activation domains 1–2 and deletion of the proline-rich domain abolish mutant p53 to regulate Gro1 and Id2, both of which are regulated by and mediate endogenous mutant p53 gain of function. These results indicate that both conformation and contact-site mutants share a property for cell transformation, and the domains critical for wild-type p53 tumor suppression are also required for mutant p53 tumor promotion. Thus, the inhibitory basic domain and the common property for p53 mutants can be explored for targeting tumors with mutant p53. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in human cancer (1Levine A.J. Oren M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The majority of tumor-derived p53 mutations is missense point mutation and clustered within the central DNA-binding domain. Mutant p53 is defective in sequence-specific DNA binding and growth inhibition (2Brosh R. Rotter V. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 3Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar), which defines the classical loss of function mutation for a tumor suppressor. In addition, p53 mutants with an intact domain for tetramerization are dominant negative because the mutants can form a heterotetramer with wild-type p53 (4Milner J. Medcalf E.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 765-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 5Willis A. Jung E.J. Wakefield T. Chen X. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2330-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a growing number of studies have provided compelling evidence that p53 mutants have acquired additional functions independent of wild-type p53, called gain of function (2Brosh R. Rotter V. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). For example, knock-in mice that carry one null allele and one mutant allele of the p53 gene (R172H or R270H) developed novel tumors when compared with p53-null mice (6Lang G.A. Iwakuma T. Suh Y.A. Liu G. Rao V.A. Parant J.M. Valentin-Vega Y.A. Terzian T. Caldwell L.C. Strong L.C. El-Naggar A.K. Lozano G.

Furthermore, mouse embryo fibroblasts from mutant mice homozygous in R172H displayed enhanced cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and transformation potential (6Lang G.A. Iwakuma T. Suh Y.A. Liu G. Rao V.A. Parant J.M. Valentin-Vega Y.A. Terzian T. Caldwell L.C. Strong L.C. El-Naggar A.K. Lozano G. Cell. 2004; 119: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it appears that gain of function is dependent on the ability of mutant p53 to transactivate or repress specific target genes, such as c-Myc, Fas, and NF-κB2 genes (8Frazier M.W. He X.

Oren M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5667-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Indeed, the spectrum of genes regulated by mutant p53 is quite distinct from that regulated by wild-type p53 (2Brosh R. Rotter V. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify target genes in a physiologically relevant context, we found that inducible knockdown of mutant p53 in SW480 and MIA PaCa-2 cells leads to increased expression of Id2 (11Yan W. Liu G. Scoumanne A. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) but decreased expression of Gro1 (12Yan W. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12178-12187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Structural and functional analyses have shown that wild-type p53 contains several functional domains (13Harms K.L. Chen X. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These are N-terminal activation domain 1 (AD1) 2The abbreviations used are: ADactivation domain 1BDbasic domainPRDproline-rich domainKDknockdownHAhemagglutininsiRNAsmall interfering RNART-PCRreverse transcription-PCRCPTcamptothecin. within residues 1–42 and activation domain 2 (AD2) within residues 43–61, the proline-rich domain (PRD) within residues 62–91, the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain within residues 102–292, and the extreme C-terminal basic domain (BD) within residues 364–393. The functional domains in wild-type p53 have been subject to extensive analysis (13Harms K.L. Chen X. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Brooks C.L.

Teresky A.K. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2387-2390PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we and others identified AD2, which is required for p53-dependent apoptosis (17Candau R. Scolnick D.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, we and others showed that the PRD is necessary for induction of apoptosis and contributes to growth suppression (19Venot C. Maratrat M. Dureuil C. Conseiller E. Bracco L. Debussche L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4668-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 20Zhu J. Zhang S. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The BD is found to be extensively modified and fine-tunes p53 transcriptional activity (15Vousden K.H. Prives C. Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar). For example, the DNA binding activity of p53 is increased by phosphorylation of multiple serine residues, acetylation of multiple lysine residues, and binding of a specific antibody or peptide to this domain (3Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar, 14Brooks C.L. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Thus, the tumor suppression and transcriptional activity of p53 are tightly controlled by its functional domains. activation domain 1 basic domain proline-rich domain knockdown hemagglutinin small interfering RNA reverse transcription-PCR camptothecin. Despite the wealth of information about the functional domains in wild-type p53, there are only a few reports on mutant p53 functional domains. Previous studies showed that the integrity of activation domain 1 is required for mutant p53 gain of function in p53-null cells (9Scian M.J. Stagliano K.E. Anderson M.A. Hassan S. Bowman M. Miles M.F. Deb S.P. Deb S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10097-10110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Lin J. Teresky A.K. Levine A.J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4163-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of residues 360–393 impairs mutant p53(D281G) to regulate the c-Myc promoter (8Frazier M.W. He X. Wang J. Gu Z. Cleveland J.L. Zambetti G.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3735-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism, and more importantly, the physiological significance of the functional domains are still unclear. Here, to determine whether various classes of p53 mutants differ in their capability to maintain the transformed phenotypes of tumor cells and functional domains necessary for mutant p53 gain of function, we generated a series of SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant p53 can be knocked down inducibly or stably by small interfering RNA (siRNA), whereas an siRNA-resistant mutant p53 along with a mutated functional domain can be stably or inducibly expressed. We found that both contact-site (R248W and R273H) and conformation (G245S and R249S) mutants are able to maintain the transformed phenotypes conferred by endogenous mutant p53 in SW480 cells. We found that AD1, AD2, and PRD are necessary for mutant p53 to maintain the transformed phenotypes and resistance toward chemotherapeutic drugs, whereas BD suppresses this effect. Thus, a strategy to target the inhibitory basic domain and the common property can be explored for tumors with mutant p53. Colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line SW480, harboring mutant p53 R273H/P309S, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). SW480-p53-KD cell line, in which siRNA targeting p53 can be inducibly expressed under the control of the tetracycline-regulated promoter, was used as described (23Yan W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9117-9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The control cell line SW480-LacZ-KD, in which siRNA targeting bacterial β-galactosidase mRNA (LacZ) can be inducibly expressed, was generated as described (23Yan W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9117-9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To generate SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant p53 can be inducibly knocked down, whereas an siRNA-resistant mutant p53 is stably expressed, mutant p53 in pcDNA3 was transfected into p53-KD SW480 cells. The resulting cell lines were selected with G418 and then confirmed by Western blot analysis. To generate SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant p53 is inducibly knocked down, whereas an siRNA-resistant mutant p53 is inducibly expressed, mutant p53 in pcDNA4 was transfected into p53-KD SW480 cells. The resulting cell lines were selected with Zeocin and then confirmed by Western blot analysis. To generate SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant p53 is stably knocked down, whereas an siRNA-resistant mutant p53 is inducibly expressed, p53 siRNA-expressing pBabe-U6 and mutant p53 in pcDNA4 were co-transfected into SW480 cells, in which a tetracycline repressor is expressed by pcDNA6. The resulting cell lines were selected with puromycin and Zeocin and then confirmed by Western blot analysis. Antibodies against p53 (FL-393 and PAb421), HA tag, and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Sigma. The constructs that stably or inducibly express siRNA against p53 were used as described (24Liu G. Chen X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 1398-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To generate a construct that inducibly expresses siRNA against LacZ, one pair of oligonucleotides was synthesized and cloned into pBabe-H1 at HindIII and BglII sites, and the resulting construct was designated as pBabe-H1-LacZ siRNA. The siRNA oligonucleotides are sense, 5′-GATCCCCTTTAACCGCCAGTCAGGCTTTCAAGAGAAGCCTGACTGGCGGTTAAATTTTTGGAAA-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAATTTAACCGCCAGTCAGGCTTCTCTTGAAAGCCTGACTGGCGGTTAAAGGG-3′, with the siRNA targeting region underlined. To generate a construct expressing LacZ protein, an 1,163-bp DNA fragment encoding HA-tagged C-terminal 375-amino acid (GenBankTM NC_008563) was amplified with forward primer, 5′-AAGCTTACCATGTACCCATACGACGTACCAGATTACGCTGAGTTCCTGCACTGGATGG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CTCGAGTTATTTTTGACACCAGACCAAC-3′. The fragment was confirmed by sequencing and then cloned into pcDNA3 at HindIII and XhoI sites, and the resulting plasmid was designated as pcDNA3-HA-LacZ. To generate a construct expressing siRNA-resistant mutant p53, an 1,182-bp DNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame of mutant p53, in which CAG (underlined) within siRNA targeting region (5′-GACTCCAGTGGTAATCTAC-3′) was replaced with ATC, was amplified with forward primer, 5′-AAGCTTACCATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CTCGAGTCAGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTTC-3′. The fragment was confirmed by sequencing and then cloned into pcDNA3 or pcDNA4 at HindIII and XhoI sites, and the resulting plasmid was designated as pcDNA3- or pcDNA4-mutant p53. To generate a construct expressing siRNA-resistant mutant p53 (ΔBD), an 1,104-bp DNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–363 was amplified with forward primer, 5′-AAGCTTACCATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CTCGAGTCACCTGCTCCCCCCTGGCTCCT-3′. The fragment was confirmed by sequencing and then cloned into pcDNA4. To generate a construct expressing siRNA-resistant mutant p53(ΔPRD), which lacks residues 62–91, p53(Gln-22/Ser-23), or p53(Gln-53/Ser-54), a two-step PCR-based method was used. For p53(ΔPRD), fragment 1 was amplified with forward primer P1, 5′-AAGCTTACCATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCC-3′, and reverse primer P2, 5′-GACAGAAGATGACAGGGGATCTGGACCTGGGTCTTC-3′; fragment 2 was amplified with forward primer P3, 5′-GAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATCCCCTGTCATCTTCTGTC-3′, and reverse primer P4, 5′-CTCGAGtCAGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTTC-3′. For p53(Gln-22/Ser-23), fragment 1 was amplified with forward primer P1, and reverse primer, 5′-CGTTG TTTTCAGGAAGTAGTTTGGATTGGTCTGAAAATGTTTCCTGAC-3′; fragment 2 was amplified with forward primer, 5′-GTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCAATCCAAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACG-3′, and reverse primer P4. For p53(Gln-53/Ser-54), fragment 1 was amplified with forward primer P1 and reverse primer, 5′-GGACCTGGGTCTTCAGTGGACTGTTGTTCAATATCGTCCG-3′; fragment 2 was amplified with forward primer, 5′-CGGACGATATTGAACAACAGTCCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCC-3′, and reverse primer P4. Then, fragments 1–2 were mixed together as a template and amplified with primers P1 and P4. The resulting fragments encoding p53(ΔPRD), p53(Gln-22/Ser-23), and p53(Gln-53/Ser-54) were confirmed by sequencing and cloned into pcDNA4. Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using an IscriptTM cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). To measure Id2 mRNA, RT-PCR was done with forward primer 5′-ATGAAAGCCTTCAGTCCCGTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCAGCCACACAGTGCTTTGC-3′. To measure Gro1 mRNA, RT-PCR was done with forward primer 5′-ATGGCCCGCGCTGCTCTCTCCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCAGTTGGATTTGTCACTGTTCAG-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified with forward primer 5′-CATCTTCTTTTGCGTCGCCAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCGC-3′. SW480 cells (1,000 per well) in a six-well plate were cultured in the absence or presence of tetracycline (1.0 μg/ml) for 72 h and then untreated or treated with 50 nm camptothecin for 4 h followed by one wash with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to remove camptothecin. The cells were maintained in fresh medium for the next 15–17 days and then fixed with methanol/glacial acetic acid (7:1) and stained with 0.1% of crystal violet. Two-tailed Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance. p < 0.05 was considered significant. We and others showed that tumor cell lines, including SW480 cells, which carry a mutant p53, are addicted to the mutant for cell survival and proliferation (11Yan W. Liu G. Scoumanne A. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Irwin M.S. Kondo K. Marin M.C. Cheng L.S. Hahn W.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether in the same genetic background both contact-site and conformation mutants are capable of maintaining the transformed phenotypes of tumor cells. Thus, the SW480 cell line, which carries mutant R273H/P309S, was chosen to address this. Previously, we generated multiple inducible p53 knockdown SW480 cell lines and showed that mutant p53 is required for the colony-forming ability of SW480 cells (11Yan W. Liu G. Scoumanne A. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similar to our previous observation (11Yan W. Liu G. Scoumanne A. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), here we showed that upon induction of siRNA against p53, the level of mutant p53 protein was reduced (Fig. 1A), which inhibited SW480 cells to form colonies (Fig. 1B). In addition, knockdown of mutant p53 sensitized SW480 cells to treatment with camptothecin, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I and a chemotherapeutic drug (Fig. 1B). We also generated SW480 cell lines in which siRNA against LacZ transcript can be inducibly expressed under the control of the tetracycline-regulated promoter. We showed that upon induction of LacZ siRNA, the level of LacZ protein was decreased, whereas the level of mutant p53 protein was not affected in SW480 cells transiently transfected with LacZ-expressing vector (Fig. 1C). In addition, inducible expression of LacZ siRNA in SW480 cells had little if any effect on cell proliferation regardless of treatment with camptothecin (Fig. 1D). Next, we generated a series of SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant p53 can be inducibly knocked down, whereas an siRNA-resistant tumor-derived hot spot mutant, including contact-site mutants (R248W and R273H) and conformation mutants (G245S and R249S), was stably expressed. We would like to note that codon 72 in endogenous mutant p53 encodes an arginine, whereas that in exogenous mutant p53 encodes a proline. As a result, exogenous mutant p53 can be separated from endogenous mutant p53 in an SDS-PAGE gel. Upon induction of siRNA against p53, endogenous mutant p53 was knocked down (Fig. 2, A, C, E, and G, compare lanes 1 and 3 with lanes 2 and 4, respectively). In addition, exogenous mutant p53 was stably expressed (Fig. 2, A, C, E, and G). Except for G245S-producing clone 9 and R249S-producing clone 2 in which exogenous mutant was expressed at an extremely low level, all other clones expressed mutant p53 at a level equivalent to that for endogenous mutant p53. To test whether these mutants are capable of substituting endogenous R273H/P309S for colony formation, one clone was chosen for further analysis. We showed that in the presence of an exogenous mutant p53, knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 had no effect on the number of colonies formed by SW480 cells regardless of treatment with camptothecin (Fig. 2, B, D, F, and H). This suggests that stable replacement with G245S, R248W, R249S, and R273H was capable of rescuing the proliferative defect in SW480 cells induced by knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 and conferring resistance to growth suppression by treatment with camptothecin. To further expand the above observations, we generated SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant p53 was stably knocked down by siRNA, whereas an siRNA-resistant mutant, including G245S, R248W, R249S, and R273H, can be inducibly expressed. As shown in Fig. 3, mutant p53 was expressed upon induction, whereas endogenous mutant p53 was nearly undetectable (Fig. 3, A, E, and G) or expressed at a low level (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, we showed that inducible expression of an exogenous mutant p53 was able to promote the colony-forming ability of SW480 cells along with reduced sensitivity to treatment with camptothecin when endogenous mutant p53 was stably knocked down (Fig. 3, B, D, F, and H). Here, we would like note that colony quantification and statistical analyses were not performed for R273H-producing SW480 cells in the absence of camptothecin treatment due to the large number of colonies (Fig. 3H, right panel). The gain of function in colony-forming activity for each of the four p53 mutants appears to be stronger in SW480 cells in which endogenous mutant p53 was stably knocked down than that in which endogenous mutant p53 was inducibly knocked down. This may be due to multiple factors, including the extent of knockdown for endogenous mutant p53 by stable and inducible approaches and the length of time for which SW480 cells were cultured without endogenous mutant p53. To address this, we generated SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant p53 can be inducibly knocked down and at the same time an siRNA-resistant mutant p53 can be inducibly expressed. We showed that upon induction, endogenous mutant p53 was markedly knocked down, whereas exogenous p53 mutants, G245S and R248W, were expressed (Fig. 4, A and C). We would like to note that only a minute amount of exogenous mutant p53 was expressed in SW480-producing line 11 (Fig. 4C). Next, a colony formation assay was performed and showed that G245S and R248W were able to rescue the colony-forming defect caused by inducible knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 and to confer resistance to growth suppression by treatment with camptothecin (Fig. 4, B and D). We would also like to note that the colony-forming activity of SW480 cells was slightly enhanced by R248W, which may be due to a slightly higher expression level of the mutant. Nevertheless, three separate approaches led to the similar conclusion that the loss of the transformed phenotypes (cell proliferation and survival) upon knockdown of endogenous mutant R273H/P309S can be restored by an exogenous mutant p53 in SW480 cells. In addition to the DNA-binding domain, AD1, AD2, PRD, and BD are known to regulate wild-type p53 activity for tumor suppression (13Harms K.L. Chen X. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Vousden K.H. Prives C. Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar), but the requirement of these domains for mutant p53 in a physiologically relevant setting is still not certain. Thus, we generated siRNA-resistant G245S and R248W mutants along with a mutation in AD1 that carries a double-point mutation (Gln-22/Ser-23), in AD2 that carries a double-point mutation (Gln-53/Ser-54), in PRD that lacks residues 62–91, or in BD that lacks residues 364–393. To determine the requirement of AD1 for mutant p53 gain of function, we generated multiple SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant p53 can be inducibly knocked down, whereas AD1-deficient G245S or R248W can be inducibly expressed (Fig. 5, A and C). Next, a colony formation assay was performed and showed that some colonies were formed upon expression of G245S(Gln-22/Ser-23) and R248W(Gln-22/Ser-23), even with treatment of camptothecin (Fig. 5, B and D). However, the extent of the rescue was much less by G245S(Gln-22/Ser-23) and R248W(Gln-22/Ser-23) than that by G245S and R248W (Fig. 4, B and D). Similarly, several SW480 cell lines were generated in which endogenous mutant p53 can be inducibly knocked down, whereas G245S or R248W along with a mutation in AD2 (Gln-53/Ser-54) or a deletion of PRD (ΔPRD) can be inducibly expressed (Fig. 6, A and C; Fig. 7, A and C). We showed that AD2 mutation and PRD deletion made G245S and R248W less efficient in rescuing the colony-forming ability and in conferring resistance to growth suppression by treatment of camptothecin in SW480 cells upon knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 (Fig. 6, B and D; Fig. 7, B and D).FIGURE 7Mutant G245S or R248W without the proline-rich domain (Δ62–91) is deficient in rescuing the proliferation defect of SW480 cells induced by knockdown of endogenous mutant p53.

Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion of the BD impairs mutant p53 D281G to activate the c-Myc promoter (8Frazier M.W. He X. Wang J. Gu Z. Cleveland J.L. Zambetti G.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3735-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To further define the activity of BD for mutant p53 gain of function, we generated multiple SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant p53 can be inducibly knocked down, whereas siRNA-resistant G245S(ΔBD) or R248W(ΔBD) can be inducibly expressed. Western blot analysis showed that upon induction, endogenous mutant p53 was knocked down, whereas exogenous G245S(ΔBD) or R248W(ΔBD) was expressed (Fig. 8, A and C, top panel). We would like to note that due to an abnormal migration pattern, G245S(ΔBD) and R248W(ΔBD), migrated at the same position as endogenous full-length mutant p53 in SDS-PAGE gels. This phenomenon was also observed previously (28Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). To address this, Pab421 antibody, which recognizes an epitope within residues 371–380 and thus would not recognize BD-deleted p53, was used for Western blot analysis. We showed that upon induction, endogenous full-length mutant p53 was inducibly knocked down, whereas exogenous G245S(ΔBD) and R248W(ΔBD) were not detected (Fig. 8, A and C, middle panel). Next, colony formation assay was performed and showed that upon induction of G245S(ΔBD) or R248W(ΔBD), the colony-forming ability of SW480 cells was markedly enhanced at both the mock-treated and the camptothecin-treated conditions (Fig. 8, B and D). We would like to note that colony quantification and statistical analyses were not performed for R248W(ΔBD)-producing SW480 cells in the absence of camptothecin treatment due to the large number of colonies (Fig. 8D, right panel). To further confirm this, we generated SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant p53 was stably knocked down, whereas siRNA-resistant G245S(ΔBD) or R248W(ΔBD) can be inducibly expressed (Fig. 8, E and G). Similarly, we showed that G245S(ΔBD) and R248W(ΔBD) promoted the colony-forming activity of SW480 cells at both the mock-treated and the camptothecin-treated conditions (Fig. 8, F and H). To determine the underlying mechanism by which mutations in AD1, AD2, or PRD inhibit, whereas deletion of BD enhances, the gain of function for mutant p53, we examined the expression pattern of Id2 and Gro1 in SW480 cells. Previously, we showed that upon knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 in SW480 and MIA PaCa-2 cells, Id2 expression is induced, whereas Gro1 expression is inhibited (11Yan W. Liu G. Scoumanne A. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Yan W. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12178-12187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that knockdown of Id2 and ectopic expression of Gro1 are able to rescue the proliferative defect in SW480 and MIA PaCa-2 cells induced by knockdown of mutant p53 (11Yan W. Liu G. Scoumanne A. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Yan W. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12178-12187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, Id2 and Gro1 expression was examined by RT-PCR in SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant p53 can be inducibly knocked down, whereas an siRNA-resistant mutant p53 can be inducibly expressed. We showed that upon knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 but not expression of siRNA against LacZ, Gro1 expression was inhibited, whereas Id2 expression was increased (Fig. 9A), consistent with our previous reports (11Yan W. Liu G. Scoumanne A. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Yan W. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12178-12187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We also showed that inducible replacement with G245S or R248W in SW480 cells upon inducible knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 restored the expression pattern of Gro1 to a level similar to that at the control condition (Fig. 9B, Gro1 panel, compare lanes 1 and 3 with lanes 2 and 4, respectively). Furthermore, the expression of Id2 was repressed by G245S and R248W to a level slightly lower than that at the control condition (Fig. 9B, Id2 panel, compare lanes 1 and 3 with lanes 2 and 4, respectively). However, the altered expression pattern of Gro1 and Id2 in SW480 cells due to knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 was not fully restored to the basal level by mutant p53 with a double-point mutation in AD1 (Fig. 9C) and in AD2 (Fig. 9D) or with a deletion of PRD (Fig. 9E). In contrast, we showed that deletion of the BD made mutant G245S and R248W efficiently restore the normal expression pattern of Gro1 and Id2 in SW480 cells altered by knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 (Fig. 9F). In fact, the level of Gro1 was slightly increased upon inducible expression of R248W(ΔBD) in p53 knockdown SW480 cells (Fig. 9F), which may be responsible for the enhanced colony-forming ability of SW480 cells with knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 (Fig. 8). Molecular oncogenic properties for mutant p53 have been extensively investigated, mostly via ectopic expression in p53-null cells to examine gain of function. Although many properties for mutant p53 have been identified, such as mutant p53 having a transcriptional activity distinct from wild-type p53, these approaches have limitations (2Brosh R. Rotter V. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The most challenging one is that most tumor cells carrying no p53, such as the H1299 cell line, may have already been transformed and do not require mutant p53 for maintaining their transformed phenotypes (11Yan W. Liu G. Scoumanne A. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the ideal approach to investigate mutant p53 is to use tumor cells in which endogenous mutant p53 is required for keeping their transformed phenotypes. Previously, we and others showed that endogenous mutant R273H/P309S is required for SW480 cell proliferation and survival (11Yan W. Liu G. Scoumanne A. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Yan W. Chen X. J. Biol.

Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). With such a system, we demonstrated that both conformation (G245S and R249S) and contact-site (R248W and R273H) mutants share a common property in rescuing the colony-forming defect in SW480 cells induced by knockdown of endogenous mutant p53. In addition, we found that activation domains 1–2 and the proline-rich domain are necessary for mutant p53 transcriptional activity, whereas the C-terminal basic domain is an inhibitory domain. Therefore, the inhibitory basic domain and the common property for both classes of mutants can be explored for cancer therapeutic development. Wild-type p53 deficient in activation domain 1 (Gln-22/Ser-23) is defective in inducing cell cycle arrest but retains limited activity in inducing apoptosis (28Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 29Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K.H. Oren M.

This is likely due to compromised transcriptional activity for p53(Gln-22/Ser-23), which has a limited activity in regulating a subset of p53 target genes (18Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Johnson T.M. Attardi L.D.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1937-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As a result, thymus-specific knock-in of mouse p53(Gln-25/Ser-26) makes mice prone to thymus lymphomas, suggesting that transcriptional activity conferred by activation domain 1 is required for p53-dependent tumor suppression (32Gaidarenko O. Xu Y. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 4397-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For mutant p53, several studies showed that Gln-22/Ser-23 mutation inactivates mutant p53 to regulate the promoters of putative mutant p53 target genes, such as MDR1 and c-Myc (8Frazier M.W. He X. Wang J. Gu Z. Cleveland J.L. Zambetti G.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3735-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Lin J. Teresky A.K. Levine A.J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4163-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, knock-in mice with mutant p53(A135V) deficient in activation domain 1 are prone to tumors in a manner similar to p53-null mice (33Nistér M. Tang M. Zhang X.Q. Yin C. Beeche M. Hu X. Enblad G. van Dyke T. Wahl G.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3563-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) instead of being similar to that of mutant R172H and R270H knock-in mice, which are prone to metastatic tumors (6Lang G.A. Iwakuma T. Suh Y.A. Liu G. Rao V.A. Parant J.M. Valentin-Vega Y.A. Terzian T. Caldwell L.C. Strong L.C. El-Naggar A.K. Lozano G.

Consistent with the above studies, here we showed that inducible expression of G245S(Gln-22/Ser-23) and R248W(Gln-22/Ser-23) is not able to rescue the colony-forming defect and proper expression of Gro1 and Id2 in SW480 cells induced by knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9). Wild-type p53 deficient in activation domain 2 (Gln-53/Ser-54) is defective in inducing apoptosis but retains an activity in inducing cell cycle arrest (18Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Zhu J. Zhang S. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39927-39934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This is probably due to compromised activity for p53(Gln-53/Ser-54) to regulate proapoptotic p53 target genes, such as Bax and PIG3 (18Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Zhu J. Zhang S. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol.

Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 3492-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the role of activation domain 2 in mutant p53 has not been examined. Here, we showed that inducible expression of G245S(Gln-53/Ser-54) and R248W(Gln-53/Ser-54) is not able to rescue the colony-forming defect and proper expression of Gro1 and Id2 in SW480 cells induced by knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9). Thus, like activation domain 1, activation domain 2 is also necessary for mutant p53 gain of function. PRD is required for wild-type p53 to suppress colony formation (21Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and lack of PRD makes wild-type p53 deficient in inducing proapoptotic target genes, and to a lesser extent, growth-arrest genes (35Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Zhu K. Chen X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2149-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). p53(ΔPRD) knock-in mice are prone to B-cell lymphoma instead of T cell lymphoma in p53-null mouse (36Slatter T.L. Ganesan P. Holzhauer C. Mehta R. Rubio C. Williams G. Wilson M. Royds J.A. Baird M.A. Braithwaite A.W. Cell Death Differ. 2010; 17: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, mice with a mutation in PRD are able to rescue lethality by loss of Mdm4 but not Mdm2 (37Toledo F. Krummel K.A. Lee C.J. Liu C.W. Rodewald L.W. Tang M. Wahl G.M. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 273-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This suggests that PRD is required for proper function of wild-type p53. Here, we showed that inducible expression of G245S(ΔPRD) and R248W(ΔPRD) is not able to rescue the colony-forming defect and proper expression of Gro1 and Id2 in SW480 cells induced by knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 (FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9). Thus, like wild-type p53, mutant p53 is also dependent on PRD for its gain of function. The BD and its modifications fine-tune p53-dependent transcriptional activity and tumor suppression in vitro and in vivo (14Brooks C.L. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 15Vousden K.H. Prives C.

Cancer. 2009; 9: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The BD is also found to be an inhibitory domain for p53 to activate IGFBP3, an effector of apoptosis (27Harms K.L. Chen X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2014-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For mutant p53, the BD is necessary for mutant D281G to regulate the c-Myc promoter (8Frazier M.W. He X. Wang J. Gu Z. Cleveland J.L. Zambetti G.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3735-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and Ser-392 nonphosphorylatable p53 mutants, His-175/Ala-392 and Trp-248/Ala-392, are more potent in transforming rat embryo fibroblasts in cooperation with the ras oncogene than His-175/Ser-392 and Trp-248/Ser-392 (39Yap D.B. Hsieh J.K. Zhong S. Heath V. Gusterson B. Crook T. Lu X. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4749-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here, we found that the colony-forming ability for SW480 cells is markedly enhanced at both the mock-treated and the camptothecin-treated conditions by G245S(ΔBD) and R248W(ΔBD) (Fig. 8). Furthermore, we showed that in SW480 cells upon knockdown of endogenous mutant p53, G245S(ΔBD) is capable of restoring normal expression pattern of Gro1 and Id2, whereas R248W(ΔBD) efficiently represses Id2 expression and further enhances Gro1 expression (Fig. 9). Because ectopic expression of Gro1 is able to rescue the proliferative defect in SW480 cells induced by knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 (12Yan W. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12178-12187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the enhanced expression of Gro1 by R248W(ΔBD) is at least in part responsible for the enhanced colony-forming activity for the mutant. Nevertheless, it is also possible that other novel pro-growth target genes may be highly induced or that other antigrowth target genes may be highly repressed by mutant p53 without the inhibitory basic domain. Thus, future studies are warranted to identify such mutant p53 target genes and the mechanism by which the BD regulates mutant p53 transcriptional activity."

The calcium signal robustly activates the channel via calcineurin, whereas the anchoring of 14-3-3 interferes with the return of the current to the resting state after the activation in Xenopus oocytes. In the present study, we report that the phosphorylation of TRESK at two distinct regulatory regions, the 14-3-3 binding site (Ser-264) and the cluster of three adjacent serine residues (Ser-274, Ser-276, and Ser-279), are responsible for channel inhibition. The phosphorylation of Ser-264 by protein kinase A accelerated the return of the current of S276E mutant TRESK to the resting state after the calcineurin-dependent activation. In the presence of 14-3-3, the basal current of the S276E mutant was reduced, and its calcineurin-dependent activation was augmented, suggesting that the direct binding of the adaptor protein to TRESK contributed to the basal inhibition of the channel under resting conditions. Unexpectedly, we found that 14-3-3 impeded the recovery of the current of S264E mutant TRESK to the resting state after the calcineurin-dependent activation, despite of the mutated 14-3-3 binding site. This suggests that 14-3-3 inhibited the kinase phosphorylating the regulatory cluster of Ser-274, Ser-276, and Ser-279, independently of the direct interaction between TRESK and 14-3-3. In conclusion, two distinct inhibitory kinase pathways converge on TRESK, and their effect on the calcineurin-dependent regulation is differentially modulated by the functional availability of 14-3-3.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, was responsible for the activation (5Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We have shown that calcineurin directly interacts with a Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT)-like docking motif of TRESK (18Czirják G. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14677-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This interaction with calcineurin via the NFAT-like motif is unique for TRESK among the ion channels. In addition to the enzymatic activation of the phosphatase, the calcium/calmodulin complex also stimulated the docking of calcineurin to the NFAT-like motif of TRESK (18Czirják G. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14677-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A surface of the phosphatase distinct from the active site of the enzyme is involved in the interaction (19Li H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1659-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the affinity of TRESK for calcineurin is the highest among the known protein ligands containing an NFAT-like motif (20Li H. Zhang L. Rao A. Harrison S.C. Hogan P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 1296-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). TRESK activation in response to the stimulation of Gq protein-coupled receptors has also been reported in DRG neurons (3Kang D. Kim G.T. Kim E.J. La J.H. Lee J.S. Lee E.S. Park J.Y. Hong S.G. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 367: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cell-attached patches containing TRESK channels were selected, and the application of acetylcholine, glutamate, or histamine to the bath increased the single channel average current by about 30–100% (3Kang D. Kim G.T. Kim E.J. La J.H. Lee J.S. Lee E.S. Park J.Y. Hong S.G. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 367: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of activation has not been examined in this painstaking experimental setup, the efficiency of the agonist applied outside the examined membrane patch also suggested the involvement of a diffusible cytoplasmic messenger in DRG neurons, in accordance with the possible contribution of calcium and calcineurin (3Kang D. Kim G.T. Kim E.J. La J.H. Lee J.S. Lee E.S. Park J.Y. Hong S.G. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 367: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have recently identified another interacting partner of TRESK, 14-3-3 adaptor protein (21Czirják G. Vuity D. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15672-15680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 binds to the RSNSCPE motif (a typical mode 1 site) in the intracellular loop of the channel, if the second (underlined) serine (Ser-264 in mouse TRESK) is phosphorylated (21Czirják G. Vuity D. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15672-15680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The interaction between TRESK and 14-3-3 has a functional consequence different from that of the previously described association of TASK-1 or TASK-3 K2P channels with the adaptor protein. TASK channels (containing an atypical C-terminal mode 3 binding site) are redirected to the cell surface as the binding of 14-3-3 overrides endoplasmic reticulum retention signal(s), i.e. the expression of the channels is enhanced (22O'Kelly I.

According to a recent study, N-glycosylation modulates the surface expression of TRESK (26Egenberger B. Polleichtner G. Wischmeyer E. Döring F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 391: 1262-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and we have shown that 14-3-3 regulates TRESK channel activity (21Czirják G. Vuity D. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15672-15680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After the calcineurin-dependent activation, return of TRESK current to the resting state is impeded by 14-3-3 (21Czirják G. Vuity D. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15672-15680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Originally, we proposed that the binding of 14-3-3 to the phosphorylated Ser-264 obstructed the rephosphorylation of Ser-276 after its calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation, and thus 14-3-3 interfered with the recovery (21Czirják G. Vuity D. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15672-15680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the effect of 14-3-3 on TRESK channels mutated at distinct regulatory serine residues indicated a more complex mechanism of action of the adaptor protein. The picture, emerging from the detailed analysis of the mutants, unraveled two distinct types of inhibitory phosphorylation with different relations to 14-3-3. The cloning of human and mouse TRESK cDNAs and their subcloning to the plasmid suitable for in vitro cRNA synthesis and expression in Xenopus oocytes was previously described (5Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Different mutant versions of these plasmids were produced with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primer sequences for the S264A, S264E, S274E, S276E, and S279A mutations of mouse TRESK were previously reported (5Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of all the 13 intracellular serines and 4 threonines of mouse TRESK was previously performed for the identification of putative phosphorylation sites participating in the calcineurin-dependent regulation (5Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Czirják G. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14677-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Serine 264, 274, and 276 were identified as probable regulatory residues. The average of calcineurin-dependent activation of the S279A mutant was also smaller by about 30% than that of the wild type, although this difference was not statistically significant in that study (5Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To verify the importance of the residues identified by alanine-scanning mutagenesis and examine the ensemble contribution of other serines/threonines of TRESK to the calcineurin-dependent regulation, we combined mutations of Ser-264, Ser-274, Ser-276, and Ser-279. Phosphoserine, in the respect of its negative charge, is more similar to glutamate than to alanine, and we previously found that substitution of Ser-276 with alanine induced a more drastic effect than the substitution with glutamate. (Calcium activated S276A or S276E mutant TRESK by about 10% or 2-fold, respectively (5Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)). Therefore, glutamate substitutions were used in the experiments of combined mutations (with the exception of S279A, which altered the regulation moderately by itself (5Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)). The sequence of the sense primer for the S252A mutation of human TRESK was 5′-GGAGAGGAGTAACGCATGCCCCGAACTGGTGTTGG-3′, also including a silent mutation coding for a novel SphI restriction enzyme site in addition to the desired mutation. The construction of the TRESKloop-H8 protein from the intracellular loop of mouse TRESK, the production of the substrate protein containing only three serines (274, 276, and 279) by repeated site-directed mutagenesis, and its expression in Escherichia coli was previously described (21Czirják G. Vuity D. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15672-15680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cloning of mouse 14-3-3γ, and its conversion to the R57,61A mutant, dominant negative form was also reported in our recent study (21Czirják G. Vuity D. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15672-15680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ionomycin (calcium salt, Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO as a 5 mm stock solution and diluted to 0.5 μm before measurement in all experiments. Benzocaine and forskolin were dissolved in ethanol, IBMX in DMSO. The pS-Raf259 phosphopeptide, LSQRQRSTpSTPNVHA, was purchased from Sigma as a custom-synthesized peptide (99% purity). Chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Sigma, Fluka, or Merck. Enzymes and kits of molecular biology applications were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX), Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania), New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Mouse brain for cytosol preparation derived from the NMRI mouse strain (Toxicop, Hungary). The oocytes were prepared, the cRNA was synthesized and microinjected, and two-electrode voltage clamp measurements were performed as previously described (5Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18550-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Czirják G. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5426-5432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected 1 day after defolliculation. Fifty nanoliters of the appropriate RNA solution were delivered with the Nanoliter Injector (World Precision Instruments, Saratosa, FL). Electrophysiological experiments were performed three or 4 days after the injection. Low [K+] solution contained (in mm): NaCl 95.4, KCl 2, CaCl2 1.8, HEPES 5 (pH 7.5 adjusted with NaOH). High [K+] solution contained 80 mm K+ (78 mm Na+ of the low [K+] solution was replaced with K+). TRESK background K+ current was measured at the ends of 250- or 300-ms voltage steps to −100 mV applied every 3 or 4 s in all experiments. All treatments of animals were conducted in accordance with state laws and institutional regulations. The experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of Semmelweis University. For the preparation of mouse brain cytosol, one brain of a female mouse was homogenized in 1.2 ml of a solution containing (in mm): phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 2, benzamidine 0.5, β-mercaptoethanol 9, Tris-Cl 40, pH 7.6. The lysate was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 20 min, supplemented with NaCl (to a final concentration of 100 mm) and centrifuged again at 35,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 column (1.5-cm diameter, 23-cm height) equilibrated with solution A containing (in mm): phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.5, benzamidine 0.5, β-mercaptoethanol 2, Tris-Cl 40, pH 7.6. The fractions of high optical density at 280 nm and low conductance (containing the ATP-, and salt-free proteins of the cytosol) were pooled. The gel-filtrated cytosol was diluted 8-fold with solution A, and 10 μl was added to the mutant TRESKloop-H8 protein (containing only serines 274, 276, and 279) immobilized on 10 μl of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and resuspended in 40 μl of solution containing (in mm): KCl 50, MgCl2 10, imidazole 75, β-glycerolphosphate 20, β-mercaptoethanol 4, sodium orthovanadate 0.2, HEPES 60 (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 20 μm Na2ATP, and 50 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP. The immobilized protein was phosphorylated at 37 °C for 1 h. The protein was run on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel; the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and its radioactivity was detected with a phosphorimager (GS-525, Bio-Rad). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was estimated by Student's t test for independent samples, with the exception of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffé posthoc test for multiple comparisons (as indicated under “Results”). The Statistica 8.0 program package (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK) was used for the analysis. The difference was considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Combined mutations, S264E/S274E, S264E/S276E, and S264E/S279A completely eliminated the calcineurin-dependent activation of TRESK (Fig. 1A). The response of all three double mutants was statistically different from the activation of S264E mutant channel (p < 0.01, ANOVA, Scheffé posthoc test). This indicates that the cluster of adjacent serines 274, 276, and 279 (hereafter called the S276 cluster) constitutes an important regulatory focal point in addition to Ser-264. The mutation of any single serine in the S276 cluster was sufficient to completely abrogate the regulatory function of the entire locus, probably because of the close proximity of the serines in the cluster. Because the combined mutation of the two identified regulatory regions (S264 and the S276 cluster) abolished the calcineurin-dependent activation, the phosphorylation of other serines/threonines of TRESK was not likely involved in the regulation. In vitro phosphorylation of Ser-264 by protein kinase A was previously demonstrated (21Czirják G. Vuity D. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15672-15680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, under identical conditions, the substrate protein (corresponding to a part of the intracellular loop region, amino acids 185–292 of mouse TRESK, extended with a His tag for purification from E. coli), containing serines 274, 276, and 279, and alanines instead of all the other serines, has not been phosphorylated (21Czirják G. Vuity D. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15672-15680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested the phosphorylation of this substrate protein with mouse brain cytosol. The cytosol was gel-filtrated on a Sephadex G-25 column to remove ATP, and incubated with the substrate protein immobilized on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The cytosol phosphorylated the substrate protein (Fig. 1B), indicating that the S276 cluster was indeed the target of a kinase activity different from protein kinase A. The return of the current of wild-type TRESK to the resting state after the calcineurin-dependent activation (hereafter called recovery) is inhibited by 14-3-3 (21Czirják G. Vuity D. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15672-15680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). If 14-3-3 inhibits recovery via its direct interaction with the channel then the loss-of-function mutation (S264A) of the interaction site should accelerate recovery. (We previously demonstrated that S264A mutation eliminated the binding of 14-3-3 (21Czirják G. Vuity D. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15672-15680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), as it was expected for a mode 1 motif.) Therefore we examined the kinetics of calcium-dependent regulation of S264A mutant TRESK (Fig. 2). In accordance with the permanently missing phosphorylation at one of the major regulatory sites, the S264A mutant was partially activated under resting conditions. Benzocaine sensitivity is a property discriminating activated wild-type TRESK channels from those showing basal activity in Xenopus oocytes (18Czirják G. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14677-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The benzocaine sensitivity of the basal current of S264A mutant was higher than that of the wild-type channel (22 ± 1% (n = 8) versus 10 ± 1% (n = 14) inhibition, respectively, by 1 mm at 105 s, p < 10−5, Fig. 2A). The partial activation under resting conditions also resulted in an apparently reduced calcineurin-dependent stimulation (2.5 ± 0.05-fold, in contrast to the 9.2 ± 1.0-fold activation in the wild-type group, p < 10−4, Fig. 2B). Interestingly, however, the recovery of S264A mutant TRESK was not accelerated at all. The current even increased during the washout period (−27 ± 5% recovery, Fig. 2C), in contrast to the control cells expressing the wild-type channel (32 ± 4% recovery, p < 10−8). The recovery of the S264E mutant was also slower than that of the wild-type TRESK (data not shown; see the blue curve in Fig. 3A). These results indicated that the direct interaction between TRESK and 14-3-3 did not exclusively determine the kinetics of recovery. The slow recovery of Ser-264 mutants urged us to examine how the functional availability of 14-3-3 influenced the calcium-dependent regulation of these mutants unable to directly interact with the adaptor protein. In the following experiments, the current kinetics of mutant channels was analyzed by estimating the basal current measured under resting conditions, the normalized activation evoked by the elevation of cytoplasmic calcium concentration and the recovery to the resting state during the washout period. A brief introduction to the basic theory of background K+ current regulation by single phosphorylation and the integrated evaluation of these three parameters can be found in supplemental materials S1. Because the phosphorylation of Ser-264 and also the binding of 14-3-3 to the channel were abrogated in S264E mutant TRESK, the regulation via the S276 cluster was clearly manifested in these experiments. To manipulate functional 14-3-3 levels, wild-type or dominant negative (R57,61A mutant) mouse 14-3-3γ was coexpressed with S264E mutant TRESK. (As a control group, cells expressing only the mutant channel were also measured. The results of these control cells represented the effect of endogenous 14-3-3 and have not been included in the statistical evaluation.) Three important differences were observed between the groups with elevated or diminished functional 14-3-3 levels. First, the resting K+ current of S264E mutant TRESK was 1.1 ± 0.2 μA (n = 12) when 14-3-3 was suppressed with the coexpression of dominant negative 14-3-3γ (dn14-3-3). This value was significantly smaller than the basal current of the cells coexpressing wild-type 14-3-3 (wt14-3-3) with the S264E mutant TRESK (2.0 ± 0.2 μA (n = 10), p < 0.01). Second, the calcineurin-dependent activation was augmented in the dn14-3-3 group (5.2 ± 0.6-fold at 356 s, red curve in Fig. 3A), compared with the wt14-3-3 group (1.8 ± 0.1-fold, green curve in Fig. 3A, p < 10−4). Third, the recovery was accelerated in the dn14-3-3 group (49 ± 7% at 876 s, red curve in Fig. 3B), but it was slow in the wt14-3-3 group (−8 ± 8%, green curve in Fig. 3B, p < 10−4). The reduced basal current and the augmented activation together with a modest acceleration of recovery indicated that the kinase phosphorylating the S264E mutant TRESK was activated in the cells coexpressing dn14-3-3 with the channel. Because Ser-264 was not present (and thus evidently could not be phosphorylated), 14-3-3 inhibited the kinase phosphorylating the functional S276 cluster of the S264E mutant. As the 14-3-3 binding site of TRESK was disintegrated, the adaptor protein evoked this effect independently of its direct interaction with the channel. Dominant negative 14-3-3 accelerated the recovery by alleviating the inhibitory effect of 14-3-3 on the kinase phosphorylating the S276 cluster. Because the above mechanism may mask it, the functional significance of the direct interaction between TRESK and 14-3-3 cannot be simply deduced from the measurement of the effect of 14-3-3 on wild-type TRESK. Therefore, the question was raised whether the direct interaction between TRESK and 14-3-3 modified channel activity and/or the calcineurin-dependent regulation. To address this question, we examined the effect of 14-3-3 on the S276E mutant, in which the S276 cluster (and its 14-3-3-dependent regulatory phosphorylation) was disabled. In this case, the basal K+ current was smaller in the cells coexpressing wt14-3-3 (1.3 ± 0.1 μA, n = 12) than in the cells coexpressing dn14-3-3 (2.9 ± 0.5 μA, n = 12, p < 0.01). The calcineurin-dependent activation was augmented in the wt14-3-3 group (4.3 ± 0.4-fold at 356 s, green curve in Fig. 3C), compared with the dn14-3-3 group (2.7 ± 0.2-fold, red curve in Fig. 3C, p < 0.01). Most importantly, however, the recovery was not changed by the different 14-3-3 levels (the green, blue, and red curves practically overlap in Fig. 3D). The unaltered recovery indicated that 14-3-3 did not influence the kinase phosphorylating Ser-264. With respect to the direct interaction between the channel and 14-3-3, this was anticipated. The activated fraction of S276E mutant channels are dephosphorylated at Ser-264. These dephosphorylated channels are the substrate of the kinase and determine the kinetics of recovery; however, they cannot bind 14-3-3, because the binding of 14-3-3"
https://openalex.org/W2093538176,"The effects of UV irradiation on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) gene expression and DNA replication were examined in cell lines containing mutations inactivating the XPA gene product required for nucleotide-excision repair, the DNA polymerase η responsible for translesion synthesis, or the Cockayne syndrome A and B (CSA and CSB) gene products required for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. In the absence of XPA and CSA and CSB gene products, virus replication was reduced 106-, 400-, and 100-fold, respectively. In DNA polymerase η mutant cells HSV-1 plaque efficiency was reduced 104-fold. Furthermore, DNA polymerase η was strictly required for virus replication at low multiplicities of infection but dispensable at high multiplicities of infection. Knock down of Rad 51, Rad 52, and Rad 54 levels by RNA interference reduced replication of UV-irradiated HSV-1 150-, 100-, and 50-fold, respectively. We find that transcription-coupled repair efficiently supports expression of immediate early and early genes from UV-irradiated HSV-1 DNA. In contrast, the progression of the replication fork appears to be impaired, causing a severe reduction of late gene expression. Since the HSV-1 replisome does not make use of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, we attribute the replication defect to an inability to perform proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent translesion synthesis by polymerase switching at the fork.

It appears that the overall replication fidelity is high, and existing genetic variability may be created by recombination between a limited number of strains rather than random replication errors (12Cavanaugh N.A.

It has been noted that several cellular repair proteins co-localize with viral replication proteins in a limited number of replication foci (19Wilcock D. Lane D.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 429-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20Taylor T.J. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5856-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21Wilkinson D.E. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4783-4796Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In cells, genomic stability is maintained by an intricate interplay among the replication machinery, repair proteins, and factors controlling the cell cycle (22Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 23Jackson S.P. Bartek J. Nature. 2009; 461: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). Viruses are known to interact and interfere with these mechanisms to promote their own replication (24Chaurushiya M.S. Weitzman M.D. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1166-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Such interactions may depend on specific molecular interactions with the viral replication machinery, and the outcome may thus vary considerably. Lytic replication of herpes simplex virus DNA has several distinguishing features. First, the viral replisome is structurally different from its cellular counterpart. Second, herpesvirus replication is independent of cell cycle. Third, the herpes simplex virus chromosome has no regular chromatin structure during replication (25Knipe D.M. Cliffe A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Together, these considerations might indicate that not all repair pathways are readily available to the virus and, conversely, that not all repair proteins are required for repair and recombination to be carried out. Furthermore, because the virus genome is being continuously rereplicated, there will be little time for repair between successive rounds of replication. It is, therefore, possible that the virus may be more vulnerable to certain types of DNA damage and that rapid successive rounds of replication may increase the probability for replication forks to encounter unrepaired lesions and generate an error catastrophe. To counteract such consequences, the virus must adapt to existing cellular mechanisms for repair and recombination to ensure survival. proliferating cell nuclear antigen multiplicity of infection herpes simplex virus type 1 xeroderma pigmentosum plaque-forming unit small interfering RNA CSB, Cockayne syndrome A and B, respectively. As a first step toward clarifying the role of cellular repair systems during herpesvirus replication, we have looked at repair of UV-induced lesions in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA and how they affect the progression of the viral replication cycle. The herpes simplex virus genome does not encode enzymes suitable for handling UV-damaged DNA. In the eukaryotic cell, however, several mechanisms contribute to repair of UV-damaged DNA (26Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar). Nucleotide excision repair in both the global genome and the transcription-coupled repair modes plays the predominant role as witnessed by the diseases xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome. In addition, translesion synthesis by DNA polymerase η has been shown to be significant (27Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Yuasa M. Araki M. Nogimori T. Yokoi M. Eki T. Iwai S. Hanaoka F.

In the latter instance, DNA polymerase η may either act at the replication fork as part of a tool belt provided by the PCNA trimer, or it may fulfill its role during gap-filling postreplicative repair (30Waters L.S.

Finally, unrepaired single-stranded breaks, occurring as a consequence of disrupted replication or incomplete repair, may be converted to double-stranded breaks that will require homologous recombination for repair (32San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Here, we have analyzed the contribution of these repair pathways to replication of UV-damaged HSV-1 DNA. We find that both global genome and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair has the essential role. Interestingly, DNA polymerase η is strictly required for replication of UV-damaged HSV-1 at low multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.). On the other hand, at high m.o.i., homologous recombination involving Rad51, Rad52, and Rad54 proteins plays a significant role. The latter observation suggests that viable genomes can be reconstructed from defective genomes. These studies provide the first functional insights into cellular mechanisms contributing to genomic stability of herpesviruses and demonstrate that HSV-1 may serve as a readily accessible model system for mechanistic studies of DNA repair and recombination. MRC5, XP12 (XPA), XP30 (XPV), and XP30eGFPη, which is stably transfected with a plasmid encoding the wild type DNA polymerase η, were kindly provided by Alan R. Lehmann (University of Sussex, UK) and propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) (33Kannouche P. Broughton B.C. Volker M. Hanaoka F. Mullenders L.H.F. Lehmann A.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). 600 μg/ml G418 was added to XP30eGFPη growth medium for selective pressure. Cockayne syndrome A and B mutant cell lines, GM16094 and GM16095, were from Coriell Cell Repositories and propagated as above. BHK-21 cells were cultured in Glasgow minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HSV-1 (Glasgow strain 17 syn+), UV-irradiated HSV-1 (UV/HSV-1), and calicheamicin-treated HSV-1 (calicheamicin/HSV-1) titers were determined by plaque assay on the indicated cell line, as previously described (2Muylaert I. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10865-10872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 100 μl of HSV-1 virus on a 35-mm dish was mock-irradiated or irradiated (UV/HSV-1) with 1600 J/m2 UV for 6 s at 254 nm using an UV Cross-linker CL-1000 (UVP, Upland, CA). For production of calicheamicin/HSV-1, HSV-1 viruses were mock-treated or treated with 0.1 and 1 μm calicheamicin (kindly provided by Ola Hammarsten, University of Gothenburg, Sweden) for 1 h on ice, followed by overnight incubation with 1 mm dithiothreitol on ice. MRC5 and XP30 monolayers were infected with HSV-1 and UV/HSV-1 at a m.o.i. of 5 or 0.1 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell at 37 °C. After 1 h, the inocula were removed, and the cells were washed extensively with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, followed by incubation with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. High and low m.o.i. supernatants were harvested at the indicated time points, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at −80 °C. Titers were determined by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. Validated siRNAs Hs_RAD51_7 and Hs_RAD54_7, and FlexiTube siRNAs Hs_RAD52_5, Hs_RAD52_6, Hs_RAD52_7, and Hs_RAD52_8 were purchased from Qiagen. MRC5 monolayers at 30% confluence on 24-well plates were transfected with 150 pmol of Rad51, Rad52 (a pool containing 37.5 pmol of each flexitube siRNA), or Rad54 siRNAs by using Oligofectamine as described before (2Muylaert I. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10865-10872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At 72 h after transfection, the cells were infected with HSV-1 or UV/HSV-1 at an m.o.i. of 5 pfu/cell for 24 h. Titers were determined by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. At 72 h after transfection, MRC5 monolayers were treated with SDS lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and Complete protease inhibitors mix (Roche Applied Science)) and immunoprecipitated, as described previously (2Muylaert I. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10865-10872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), using mouse monoclonal antibodies to human Rad51 (ab213) or Rad54 (ab11055) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human Rad52 (ab18264). The immunoprecipitates as well as β-actin were visualized by Western blotting using the antibodies above and an antibody against a synthetically produced β-cytoplasmic actin N-terminal peptide (ab6276). All antibodies were purchased from Abcam. For detection of ICP8 and glycoprotein C, the indicated cell monolayers were infected with HSV-1 or UV/HSV-1 at an m.o.i. of 5 pfu/cell for 12 h followed by Laemmli lysis buffer treatment and Western blot analysis, using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to HSV-1 ICP8 and mouse monoclonal antibodies to HSV-1 glycoprotein C (kindly provided by Tomas Bergström, University of Gothenburg, Sweden). All protein bands were detected with the Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). MRC5, XP12, and XP30 cells were infected with HSV-1 or UV/HSV-1 at an m.o.i. of 5 pfu/cell for 1 h, 3 h, or 6 h, and, at each time point, total DNA was isolated by using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen). All samples were denatured by boiling for 10 min, followed by incubation with an equal volume of 1 m NaOH at room temperature for 20 min. The DNA samples were next dot-blotted onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (GE Healthcare) by using the Bio-Dot apparatus (Bio-Rad) and according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was then blocked in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% milk at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with a primary anti-thymine dimer monoclonal antibody (1:5000 in PBST; MC-062, Kamiya Biomedical Company), at room temperature for 2 h. After washing, the membrane was incubated with a secondary goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 in PBST) at room temperature for 1 h. Signals were detected as above. To monitor repair of UV-damaged HSV-1, we used unirradiated cell lines mutated in essential repair proteins. In those instances where suitable mutant cell lines were not available, we have treated cells with siRNA to knock down the levels of Rad51, Rad52, and Rad54 proteins. Our standardized conditions for UV treatment of virus caused an ∼10-fold reduction in plaque number on wild type MRC5 cells. To study effects of UV irradiation on virus replication in mutant cells, we first serially diluted and plated UV-irradiated HSV-1 on normal and mutant human cell lines (Fig. 1). Nonirradiated virus replicated equally well on wild type MRC5 cells, XP12, mutated in the XPA protein, an essential component of nucleotide excision repair, and XP30 cells, mutated in DNA polymerase η (Fig. 1A). The variation in plaque size for unirradiated virus, seen in Fig. 1A, reflects differences in cell morphology rather than kinetics of virus replication. In stark contrast, we found that the plaque efficiency of UV-irradiated virus was reduced 104-fold on XP30 cells and at least 106-fold on XP12 cells (Fig. 1B). UV irradiation also caused reduced plaque size on XP30 cells. The replication-defect seen in XP30 cells could be restored by stable expression of eGFP-DNA polymerase η in XP30 cells (Fig. 1B) (33Kannouche P. Broughton B.C. Volker M. Hanaoka F. Mullenders L.H.F. Lehmann A.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We also examined virus treated with calicheamicin, a drug capable of inducing a high proportion of double-stranded breaks in DNA (34Elmroth K. Nygren J. Mårtensson S. Ismail I.H. Hammarsten O. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). MRC5, XP12, and XP30 cells all supported replication to the same extent, thus confirming that the replication defects in the mutant cell lines were specifically due to the exposure of virus to UV irradiation. To study the replication defects further, we next examined the production of infectious virus particles at low and high m.o.i. on XP30 cells. This analysis was not performed on XP12 cells because UV-irradiated virus did not grow on this cell line. We found that the yield of virus on XP30 cells after low m.o.i. infection was reduced 105-fold by UV irradiation. Possibly, lesions persisting in single-stranded regions of DNA remain unrepaired and prevent further synthesis of viable progeny. It is also likely that, in the absence of DNA polymerase η, the surviving viruses become heavily mutagenized, resulting in reduced replication efficiency. This indicates that DNA polymerase η is essential for replication of UV-damaged HSV-1 at low m.o.i. (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, the replication defect was almost abolished at high m.o.i., suggesting that a mechanism requiring multiple independent viral genomes was able to rescue viable progeny (Fig. 2B). We, therefore, surmised that the most plausible mechanism capable of restoring viable genomes at high m.o.i. would be homologous recombination. Because the enzymes required in this instance are likely to be of cellular origin, we made use of siRNA against mRNA encoding Rad51, Rad52, and Rad54 proteins. We found that siRNA had little if any effect on replication of nonirradiated HSV-1 in MRC5 cells (Fig. 3, top panel). However, when UV-irradiated virus was used, we observed 150-, 100-, and 50-fold reductions on virus yields from cells treated with siRNA against Rad51, Rad52, and Rad 54, respectively (Fig. 3, middle panel). We also verified an efficient knockdown of Rad51, Rad52, and Rad54 protein levels in siRNA-treated cells prior to virus infection (Fig. 3, bottom panel). The exact mechanism by which these proteins contribute to replication of UV-irradiated DNA is unknown, but it is plausible that viable virus genomes may be reconstructed from fragments produced during repeated rounds of DNA replication. To evaluate the physiological effects of UV-induced lesion in DNA on the viral life cycle, we have first monitored the kinetics of DNA repair. We made use of antibodies directed toward thymine dimers. The antibodies do not bind nonirradiated DNA immobilized on membranes, but readily detect lesions in UV-irradiated DNA (Fig. 4). DNA from infected cells was isolated and subjected to a dot blot analysis. We found that, in all cells, high levels of UV-damaged DNA was detected already at 1 h after infection, reflecting rapid uptake and transport of viral DNA to the nucleus. We also found that, in MRC5 cells, DNA repair was activated very early, leading to a 60% decrease of thymine dimers at 3 h after infection (Fig. 4). In XP12 cells, devoid of nucleotide excision repair, damaged DNA persisted for at least 6 h (Fig. 4). Our results suggest that nucleotide excision repair has almost immediate access to viral DNA once it has been delivered into the nucleus. Surprisingly, lesions remained to a large extent unrepaired also in XP30 cells (Fig. 4). This observation suggests that DNA polymerase η acts very early, already at 3 h after infection, during the replication cycle. It also indicates that replication of damaged DNA, in the absence of DNA polymerase η, generates intermediates that are inaccessible for nucleotide excision repair. We next wanted to investigate whether or not the reduction in virus replication could be explained by inhibition of gene expression or DNA replication. The infectious cycle of HSV-1 is characterized by tight coordination of controlled gene expression and DNA replication (1Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Lippincot Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2007: 2501-2601Google Scholar, 35Honess R.W. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1974; 14: 8-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The powerful transcription activator VP16 activates a limited number of immediate early α genes. ICP4, one of the proteins encoded by these genes, is strictly required for transcription of the early β genes which, in turn, encode the enzymes required for DNA synthesis. Finally, true late γ genes are only transcribed once DNA replication has been initiated and allowed to proceed unperturbed. Thus, these properties of the HSV-1 replication cycle allow us to distinguish effects of UV irradiation on gene expression from effects on DNA replication by looking at expression, for example, of the early gene encoding ICP8 and the late gene encoding glycoprotein C. We first found that at high m.o.i., in wild type MRC5 cells, early gene expression was equally efficient at 12 h after infection with either irradiated or nonirradiated virus (Fig. 5A). In contrast, replication-dependent expression of glycoprotein C was severely impaired in cells infected with irradiated virus, which correlates well with the low production of virus particles observed at this time point (Fig. 2B). In XP12 cells, lacking nucleotide excision repair, neither early nor late gene expression occurred at 12 h after infection with irradiated virus (Fig. 5A). The role of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair was then examined by looking at expression of ICP8 in cells containing mutations responsible for Cockayne syndromes A and B (36Cleaver J.E. Lam E.T. Revet I. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 756-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The CSA protein is associated with a cullin4a containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the CSB protein is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors (37Groisman R. Kuraoka I. Chevallier O. Gaye N. Magnaldo T. Tanaka K. Kisselev A.F. Harel-Bellan A. Nakatami Y. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1429-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We first looked at the plaque efficiency of irradiated and nonirradiated HSV-1 on these cell lines. The results showed that UV-irradiated virus produced about 400- and 100-fold fewer plaques on CSA and CSB cells, respectively, compared with nonirradiated HSV-1 (results not shown). Analysis of ICP8 expression revealed that although it was unaffected by UV irradiation in wild type MRC5 cells, it was significantly reduced in CSA and CSB cells (Fig. 5B). This suggests that transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair promotes expression of immediate early and early genes very efficiently during replication of UV-irradiated HSV-1. The results also indirectly infer that the major reason for reduced production of virus particles is reduced DNA replication in wild type cells. To examine the significance of DNA polymerase η on replication of UV-irradiated HSV-1 at high m.o.i., we looked at replication-dependent expression of the late gene encoding glycoprotein C in XP30 cells lacking functional DNA polymerase η. We found that, in contrast to robust expression of the early gene product ICP8, the expression of both the precursor protein, pgC, and the mature glycosylated processed form of glycoprotein C, gC, was abolished (38Compton T. Courtney R.J. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 594-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Because glycoprotein C expression can be detected in wild type MRC5 cells infected with UV-irradiated virus, our results suggest that DNA polymerase η contributes to DNA replication and subsequent late gene expression. It is worth noting that, although translesion synthesis by DNA polymerase η is essential for replication of UV-irradiated HSV-1 DNA at low m.o.i., it does not seem to be a very efficient process, as reflected by the low levels of glycoprotein C expression in wild type cells at high m.o.i.. As further discussed below, replication of UV-irradiated virus DNA may generate aberrant replication intermediates that might be difficult to handle. The studies presented in this report demonstrate an intimate functional relationship between cellular proteins involved in repair and recombination of viral DNA exposed to UV-irradiation and the herpes simplex virus replication cycle. In brief, our results suggest that transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair promotes expression of immediate early and early genes (Fig. 6A). Once early replication proteins are produced, the replication cycle progresses into the DNA synthesis phase. Our studies indicate that DNA polymerase η must be active on replicating virus genomes already at 3 h after infection and that it is essential for copying UV-damaged template DNA. In wild type cells infected with irradiated virus, DNA replication appears inefficient inasmuch as late gene expression is impaired. Probably, the progression of replisome is impaired once it hits a lesion. In eukaryotic cells, translesion synthesis coupled to polymerase switching, and template switching may assist replisome progression (39Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Both mechanisms rely on Rad6-Rad18-dependent monoubiquitination of PCNA. However, the herpesvirus replisome is fully functional in the absence of PCNA (5Falkenberg M. Lehman I.R. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3896-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Instead, the viral encoded UL42 protein, which has a three-dimensional structure resembling a PCNA protomer but no sequence similarity, serves a similar role by increasing the processivity of the HSV-1 DNA polymerase (4Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 40Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11227-11232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, HSV-1 UL42 acts as a monomer as opposed to PCNA, which is a trimer (10Zuccola H.J. Filman D.J. Coen D.M. Hogle J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 267-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the proper interactions between DNA polymerase η and the viral replication fork cannot be established. However, DNA polymerase η may still be active in postreplication gap-filling repair (Fig. 6B). These considerations may help to explain why the products of DNA replication made in the complete absence of DNA polymerase η appear to be inaccessible for nucleotide excision repair. In this instance, one might imagine that once a viral replisome hits a lesion it falls apart; DNA polymerase is left at the site of the lesion, and the UL5/8/52 helicase is allowed to proceed, generating extensive stretches of single-stranded DNA. The observations that the UL5/8/52 helicase-primase assisted by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein ICP8 can efficiently bypass a 1-2-intrastrand d(GpG) cross-link but the UL30 DNA polymerase would stall at the same lesion lend credibility to this suggestion (41Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13801-13807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 42Arana M.E. Song L. Tanguy Le Gac N. Parris D.S. Villani G. Boehmer P.E. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In wild type cells, however, postreplication gap filling may provide nucleotide excision repair with the appropriate substrates, allowing the replication cycle to continue (Fig. 6B). With these considerations in mind, we would like to suggest that the herpesvirus replisome and the cellular replication machinery may be affected in different ways by DNA damage. Homologous recombination serves to promote virus replication at high m.o.i., conditions under which DNA polymerase η appears to become dispensable. We favor the idea that an increased number of single-stranded gaps may give rise to double-stranded breaks upon reinitiated DNA synthesis (Fig. 6C). Homologous recombination may not only restore the physical integrity of the virus chromosome but also restore the genetic integrity by bringing together a complete set of fully functional genes, a result that would only be possible under conditions in which the cell has been infected with several virus particles. It is worth noting that although homologous recombination in cells is allowed only between sister chromatids, no such limitations appear to exist for virus chromosomes. It has long been known that HSV-1 DNA, and probably all other productively replicating herpesviruses, participate in homologous recombination stimulated by double-stranded breaks (43Sarisky R.T. Weber P.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 34-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different mechanisms have been proposed. For example, HSV-1 proteins, such as the single-stranded DNA-binding protein ICP8, may be active in recombination (44Makhov A.M. Sen A. Yu X. Simon M.N. Griffith J.D. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 386: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In fact, an in vitro system for recombination-dependent DNA synthesis requiring ICP8, HSV-1 helicase-primase, and HSV-1 DNA polymerase has been described (45Nimonkar A.V. Boehmer P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10201-10206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using a different approach, we have demonstrated that linear plasmids transfected into cultured cells may undergo homologous recombination and subsequently become replicated by the HSV-1 DNA replisome (46Yao X.-D. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2905-2913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The latter study suggested that homologous recombination was independent of viral gene functions and that it was likely to be carried out by cellular proteins. We also previously noted that expression of an ATPase-defective version of Rad51 acts as a transdominant inhibitor of recombination between HSV-1 tsS and tsK mutant viruses, resulting in reduced yield of virus with a wild type genotype (47Yao X.-D. Replication and Recombination in Cells Infected with Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1. University of Gothenburg, 1999Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently observed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rad51 caused an approximate 5-fold reduction in Epstein-Barr virus lytic replication (48Kudoh A. Iwahori S. Sato Y. Nakayama S. Isomura H. Murata T. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 6641-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, we find that replication of UV-damaged HSV-1 DNA is reduced 50–150-fold by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rad54, Rad52, and Rad51 proteins demonstrating a direct role in HSV-1 recombination repair. We conclude that the cellular apparatus for homologous recombination may act efficiently on HSV-1 DNA and promote recombination. However, our results do not exclude a direct role for HSV-1 replication proteins in similar reactions. It is apparent that the herpes simplex virus replication cycle and the cellular mechanisms for controlling and executing the DNA damage response are coordinated, causing HSV-1 to make use of, and even depend on, certain repair pathways while down-regulating other branches of the DNA damage response. For example, the DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 complex is required for circularization of linear genomes (2Muylaert I. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10865-10872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ATM kinase is also activated during HSV-1 replication (49Lilley C.E. Carson C.T. Muotri A.R. Gage F.H. Weitzman M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 5844-5849Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 50Shirata N. Kudoh A. Daikoku T. Tatsumi Y. Fujita M. Kiyono T. Sugaya Y. Isomura H. Ishizaki K. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30336-30341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is dependent on viral gene expression because UV-inactivated virus and HSV-1 amplicons fail to activate the ATM kinase. Whether or not viral DNA synthesis is required for activation remains an open question because treatment of infected cells with inhibitors of DNA synthesis only has modest effects on activation of ATM. HSV-1 may also down-regulate repair pathways. ICP0-dependent degradation of DNA-PKcs has been observed in some cell lines (51Lees-Miller S.P. Long M.C. Kilvert M.A. Lam V. Rice S.A. Spencer C.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7471-7477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HSV-1 also seems to disarm the ATR-dependent DNA-damage response and exclude γH2AX and hyperphosphorylated RPA from viral replication compartments. As a consequence, hyperphosphorylated RPA and the ATR partner ATRIP become relocated to intranuclear VICE domains (52Wilkinson D.E. Weller S.K. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2695-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Also, Mre11 is lost during HSV-1 replication (53Gregory D.A. Bachenheimer S.L. Virology. 2008; 373: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It now seems possible to make use of HSV-1 as a model system to study molecular mechanisms involved in DNA damage sensing and repair independently from cell cycle regulation and chromatin structure. Because an active HSV-1 replication fork can be reconstituted in vitro with purified components (5Falkenberg M. Lehman I.R. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3896-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the possibility of studying coupling of DNA replication with repair and recombination using purified enzymes is within reach. In addition, interactions between virus replication and cellular repair systems may influence the efficiency of antiviral treatments and also contribute to the emergence of resistance to antiviral compounds.

https://openalex.org/W2079128240,"Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key signaling event that promotes cells to move and cover wounds in many epithelia. We have previously shown that wounding activates the EGFR through activation of the Src family kinases (SFKs), which induce proteolytic shedding of epidermal growth factor-like ligands from the cell surface. A major goal in wound healing research is to identify early signals that promote motility, and here we examined the hypothesis that members of the focal adhesion kinase family are upstream activators of the SFKs after wounding. We found that focal adhesion kinase is not activated by wounding but that a different family member, Pyk2 (PTK2B/RAFTK/CAKβ), is activated rapidly and potently. Pyk2 interaction with c-Src is increased after wounding, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Disruption of Pyk2 signaling either by small interfering RNA or by expression of a dominant negative mutant led to inhibition of wound-induced activation of the SFKs and the EGFR, and conversely, overexpression of wild-type Pyk2 stimulated SFK and EGFR kinase activities in cells. In wound healing studies, Pyk2 small interfering RNA or dominant negative inhibited cell migration. These results show that activation of Pyk2 is an early signal that promotes wound healing by stimulating the SFK/EGFR signaling pathway.

The proximal event for activation of the EGFR is proteolytic release of transmembrane ligands, such as heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, by a mechanism that resembles transactivation of the EGFR by G-protein coupled receptors (15Block E.R.

Growth Factors. 2006; 24: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that the Src family kinases (SFKs) control EGFR ligand shedding after wounding (5Block E.R. Klarlund J.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4909-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Xu K.P. Yin J. Yu F.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 2832-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The SFKs are ubiquitously expressed non-receptor tyrosine kinases that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics, cell/matrix interactions, and transduction of extracellular signals (22Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). The SFKs contain Src homology 2 and 3 domains that bind to consensus phosphotyrosine and proline-rich domains, respectively, which can lead to activation by loss of inhibitory intramolecular interactions (23Roskoski Jr., R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We have recently found that SFKs and the EGFR are activated rapidly in cells within 250 μm of the wound edge (5Block E.R. Klarlund J.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4909-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, extracellular ATP is released from cells and can induce activation of the EGFR further from the wounds. However, extracellular ATP signaling is not necessary for full induction of movement of the epithelial cell sheet after wounding (5Block E.R. Klarlund J.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4909-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Farooqui R. Fenteany G. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Understanding the early events in the signaling pathway that leads to EGFR activation remains a significant challenge, and the purpose of this work was to identify the immediate activator of the SFKs. The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases includes FAK and Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) (also known as RAFTK (related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase) and CAKβ (cell adhesion kinase β)). They can be activated by a variety of stimuli that are likely to occur at wound edges, such as mechanical stretching, integrin/extracellular matrix interactions, and Ca2+ signaling (24Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar, 25Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell.

Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Here we examined the possible role of the FAK family in activating the SFKs and subsequently the EGFR. Antibodies against the EGFR, the EGFR phosphorylated on tyrosine 1173, Pyk2 phosphorylated on tyrosine 402, FAK phosphorylated on tyrosine 397, and c-Src (mouse monoclonal antibody used for immunoprecipitation) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; antibodies against SFK phosphorylated on tyrosine 416, SFK non-phosphorylated on tyrosine 416, and c-Src (rabbit polyclonal used for immunoblotting) were from Cell Signaling Technology; antibodies against Pyk2 and Fyn were from BD Biosciences; antibodies against myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate phosphorylated on serines 152 and 156 were from EMD Biosciences; antibodies against paxillin were from Invitrogen; antibodies against β-actin and FLAG were from Sigma. Tyrphostin AG 1478 and Src kinase inhibitor-I were from EMD Biosciences. ATP and grade VII potato apyrase were from Sigma. Cell culture reagents were from MediaTech, and all other supplies and reagents were from ISC BioExpress or ThermoFisher unless otherwise noted. Human corneal limbal epithelial (HCLE) cells have been immortalized by abrogation of p16INK4A/Rb and p53 functions and overexpression of the catalytic subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme (27Gipson I.K. Spurr-Michaud S. Argüeso P. Tisdale A. Ng T.F. Russo C.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 2496-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). HCLE cells were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.3 mm CaCl2, 25 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.1 ng/ml human recombinant EGF, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. At least 16 h prior to experiments, cells were washed and cultured in the same medium without pituitary extract and EGF. For wound signaling experiments, we employed a model for stimulating cell sheets by the acute exposure to free space that has been previously described (15Block E.R. Matela A.R. SundarRaj N. Iszkula E.R. Klarlund J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24307-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells are cultured around agarose droplets until they form confluent lanes 1–5 cells wide and are then acutely stimulated or “wounded” by the removal of the agarose droplets. This wounding model minimizes signaling from cell damage and allows biochemical isolation of wound edge cells (5Block E.R. Klarlund J.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4909-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For wound healing assays, cells were cultured to confluence around a single agarose strip (15Block E.R. Matela A.R. SundarRaj N.

After two (adenovirus experiments) or three (siRNA experiments) days, the agarose strip was removed, and cultures were allowed to heal for 18 h before fixation and staining with either Gentian violet or immunofluorescence reagents (see below). Micrographs of cultures were obtained before and after wounding, and wound areas were quantified using the region tracing utility in MetaMorph® software (Universal Imaging). Following stimulation, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (171 mm NaCl, 10.1 mm Na2HPO4, 3.35 mm KCl, and 1.84 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2) and lysed in either SDS (1% in H2O) or immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 260 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 tablet per 10 ml of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 5 μm pepstatin A, pH 7.5). Protein contents of extracts, determined with the BCA assay (ThermoFisher), were normalized prior to SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation, ∼250 μg of cellular protein was incubated with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry and 1 μg of antibody on an end-over-end rotator at 4 °C overnight. Bead pellets were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer and three times with immunoprecipitation buffer with Triton X-100 reduced to 0.1% before the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Multiple exposures of Western blots were collected, and densitometry of appropriate images was performed using QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). 10 nm siRNA duplexes targeting Pyk2 were transfected using siPORTTM NeoFXTM transfection reagent (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then reseeded after 2 days at experimental densities and used 4 days after transfection. Multiple Pyk2 siRNA oligonucleotides were used: CACAUGAAGUCCGAUGAGAdTdT (Sigma) and a Pyk2 SMARTpool that contains at least four duplexes of undisclosed sequence (Millipore). As a control siRNA, we used MISSION® siRNA Universal Negative Control 1 (Sigma). FLAG-tagged Pyk2 and FLAG-tagged PRNK cloned into adenovirus vectors were from Dr. Joseph C. Loftus (Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ). Adenovirus encoding tet-OFF (used as adenovirus control) was from Dr. Ora A. Weisz (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA), and adenovirus encoding green fluorescent protein was from Dr. Michael P. Czech (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). Preliminary experiments using green fluorescent protein-encoding virus helped to determine the multiplicity of infection necessary for achieving expression in 90–100% of cells. For signaling studies, cells were infected at a multiplicity of 10 for 1 h and were used the following day. For wound healing studies, cells were infected at a multiplicity of 20 in a small volume (1 × 105 cells/μl) for 1 h with gentle agitation every 15 min. After washing and centrifugation, cells were seeded and used 2 days later. The cells were fixed for 30 min by adding one-tenth volume of 37% formaldehyde to the cells. Cells were then processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described previously (15Block E.R. Matela A.R. SundarRaj N. Iszkula E.R. Klarlund J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24307-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). F-actin was visualized with Alexa Fluor® 633 phalloidin. Images were captured with a Nikon TE2000E microscope with a ×20 oil objective (numerical aperture 0.75) or an Olympus IX81 confocal microscope equipped with a ×60 oil objective (numerical aperture 1.4). Images were generated and analyzed using Fluoview® software (Olympus). All experiments reported were performed a minimum of three times with similar results. For some figures, representative Western blots are shown below densitometry from at least four replicates. Quantitative data were plotted (means ± S.D.) and analyzed by t test or one-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test using Prism (GraphPad Software). The EGFR is activated within minutes after wounding sheets of HCLE cells in a process that is triggered by SFK activation (5Block E.R. Klarlund J.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4909-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Xu K.P. Yin J. Yu F.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 2832-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the FAK family, we first tested whether FAK or Pyk2 is activated after wounding, using a wounding model that detects signaling in cells near wound edges (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 15Block E.R. Matela A.R. SundarRaj N. Iszkula E.R. Klarlund J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24307-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Pyk2 was activated 5 min after wounding as determined by Western blotting for its major autophosphorylation site on Tyr-402 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, activation of FAK was not detected. Pyk2 and FAK activation were observed after treatment of cells with a 100 nm concentration of the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (Fig. 1B), indicating that the blotting procedure was capable of detecting both kinases when autophosphorylated. Because FAK was not activated detectably after wounding, we concluded that FAK signaling is not likely to regulate SFK activity in this context, and we therefore focused on Pyk2. To eliminate effects of extracellular ATP, which can cause activation of the SFKs and the EGFR (5Block E.R. Klarlund J.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4909-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), 25 units/ml apyrase was included in the medium (Fig. 1C) to hydrolyze extracellular ATP to undetectable levels (5Block E.R. Klarlund J.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4909-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As a further test of the efficacy of the treatment, we noted that inclusion of apyrase blocked activation of protein kinase C (Fig. 1D), which is induced by ATP released from cells after wounding (28Schwiebert E.M. Zsembery A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1615: 7-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 29Stumpo D.J. Graff J.M. Albert K.A. Greengard P. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In the following experiments, apyrase was included in the incubations to eliminate signaling by ATP. In some systems, Pyk2 is activated downstream of the EGFR (31Schauwienold D. Sastre A.P. Genzel N. Schaefer M. Reusch H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27748-27756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Park S.Y. Li H. Avraham S. Cell.

However, activation of Pyk2 was not reduced in the presence of a 100 nm concentration of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG 1478, which effectively blocked EGFR autophosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Pyk2 contains tyrosines that can be phosphorylated by the SFKs, and some studies indicate that SFK-mediated phosphorylation regulates Pyk2 activity (34Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I.

Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, wound-induced Pyk2 autophosphorylation was unaffected by treatment with a 1 μm concentration of the SFK inhibitor Src kinase inhibitor-I (SKI) (Fig. 1E). The SFK inhibitor blocked EGFR phosphorylation of Tyr-845, which is catalyzed by the SFKs, demonstrating the efficacy of the inhibitor (Fig. 1E). Together, these results indicate that Pyk2 is activated independently of the EGFR and the SFKs. We were able to immunoprecipitate the major SFK isoforms c-Src and Fyn from our cells and analyze their activation states with an antibody that recognizes activated forms of the SFKs. Both c-Src (Fig. 2A) and Fyn (supplemental Fig. 1) were activated within 5 min after wounding. The SFKs may be activated downstream of the EGFR (37Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar); however, the presence of 100 nm tyrphostin AG 1478, which effectively blocked EGFR activity (not shown), had no effect on c-Src or Fyn activation, indicating that c-Src and Fyn are activated upstream of the EGFR. The SFKs can be activated by binding to Pyk2 after it is autophosphorylated (26Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Analysis of immunoprecipitates of c-Src showed the presence of increased levels of Pyk2 after wounding, suggesting an increased level of association of the two molecules (Fig. 2B). The specificities of the signals were confirmed by performing mock precipitations with non-immune IgG (Fig. 2C). The interaction did not depend on EGFR activation because co-immunoprecipitation was not blocked by the presence of tyrphostin AG 1478 (Fig. 2B). A similar analysis with c-Fyn was not possible because the signals were too faint. We initially examined the effects of reducing Pyk2 expression with siRNA prior to wounding. Cells were transfected with a 10 nm concentration of a pool of Pyk2-targeted siRNA oligonucleotides before wounding. Pyk2 siRNA transfection caused 70% reduction in Pyk2 expression compared with controls and resulted in inhibition of wound-induced SFK and EGFR activation (supplemental Fig. 2). As a confirmation and to better control for off-target effects (38Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we repeated these studies using a 10 nm concentration of a single Pyk2-targeted siRNA oligonucleotide. The Pyk2 siRNA caused ∼75% reduction in Pyk2 expression (Fig. 3A) and significantly inhibited SFK (Fig. 3B) and EGFR (Fig. 3C) activation after wounding. Treatment of Pyk2 siRNA-transfected cells with EGF yielded EGFR activation equivalent to that yielded by treatment of control-transfected cells (Fig. 3D), indicating that the siRNA did not interfere with the normal function of the EGFR. As a complement to these studies, we tested whether Pyk2 is necessary for wound-induced SFK and EGFR activation by wounding sheets of cells that express Pyk2-related non-kinase (PRNK), which is a truncated version of Pyk2 that consists of the C-terminal 228 amino acids and lacks the kinase domain. It can act in a dominant negative fashion to inhibit endogenous Pyk2 activation and signaling (39Xiong W.C. Macklem M. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PRNK (∼30 kDa) was clearly expressed in HCLE cells infected with an adenovirus coding for PRNK, and its presence blocked Pyk2 activation after wounding as expected (Fig. 4A). Importantly, activation of SFKs (Fig. 4B) and the EGFR (Fig. 4C) were also significantly inhibited by the presence of PRNK. Inhibition of Pyk2 signaling by either siRNA (Fig. 3B) or PRNK (Fig. 4B) reduced SFK activities in the unwounded condition. This indicates the presence of a basal level of stimulation of signaling by Pyk2, similar to that seen previously (40Xie J. Allen K.H. Marguet A. Berghorn K.A. Bliss S.P. Navratil A.M. Guan J.L. Roberson M.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 2322-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 41Sun C.K. Man K. Ng K.T. Ho J.W. Lim Z.X. Cheng Q. Lo C.M. Poon R.T. Fan S.T. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 2096-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). EGF-induced EGFR activation was not inhibited by PRNK expression (Fig. 4D), indicating that PRNK did not affect the EGFR directly. We also examined the effects of blocking Pyk2 signaling on the individual SFK isoforms. C-Src activation was inhibited when Pyk2 signaling was disrupted by either siRNA (Fig. 5A) or PRNK (Fig. 5B). Similarly, activation of the Fyn isoform was inhibited by either Pyk2 siRNA (Fig. 5C) or PRNK (Fig. 5D). Therefore, although we could not determine the degree to which Fyn and Pyk2 interact after wounding, Pyk2 signaling does appear to be necessary for Fyn activation. Together, the results from the studies with siRNA and PRNK indicate that Pyk2 mediates activation of the SFKs and the EGFR after wounding. After wounding, EGFR activation is induced by the SFK-mediated proteolytic shedding of transmembrane ligands, such as heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor or amphiregulin (15Block E.R. Matela A.R.

Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 4277-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To test whether increasing Pyk2 signaling promotes SFK and EGFR activation, we infected cells with adenovirus encoding wild-type Pyk2, which caused highly increased levels of activated, phosphorylated Pyk2 and, as expected, highly increased levels of activated SFKs (Fig. 6A). Importantly, Pyk2 overexpression also induced significant increases in the levels of activated EGFR (Fig. 6B), in agreement with a role for Pyk2 as an upstream activator. To address the mechanism of EGFR activation induced by Pyk2 overexpression, we first incubated cells with the general matrix metalloprotease inhibitor GM 6001. Treatment with GM 6001 but not a structurally similar control compound inhibited EGFR activation (Fig. 6B). GM 6001 did not inhibit activation by exogenous ligand (15Block E.R. Matela A.R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 24307-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the result is consistent with the notion that EGFR activation is the result of a proteolytic event. Also, the anti-EGFR antibody LA1, which blocks activation of the EGFR by ligands, inhibited EGFR activation, whereas control antibodies did not. These data indicate that Pyk2 regulates EGFR activation by triggering the proteolytic release of transmembrane ligands. Knockdown of Pyk2 by siRNA inhibited wound-induced EGFR activation (Fig. 3C). As a control, we found that EGFR activation after wounding was enhanced in siRNA-transfected cells after overexpression of Pyk2 (Fig. 6C, compare with Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data indicate that Pyk2 signaling promotes SFK and EGFR activation after wounding. We subsequently examined whether reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are produced rapidly after wounding epithelial cell sheets (42Nikolić D.L. Boettiger A.N. Bar-Sagi D. Carbeck J.D. Shvartsman S.Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 291: C68-C75Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), are upstream of Pyk2 activation. We observed that incubation of cells with the ROS inhibitors N-acetyl cysteine or butylated hydroxyanisole did not abrogate Pyk2 activation after wounding, although they inhibited activation by H2O2, which generates ROS (supplemental Fig. 4). This suggests that ROS do not stimulate wound-induced Pyk2 activation. Because Pyk2 regulates SFK and EGFR activation, we expected that modulation of Pyk2 signaling would alter healing rates in our cell culture wound healing assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Transfection with a single oligonucleotide resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of healing with a maximal 60% reduction of healing (Fig. 7A). The effect of Pyk2 siRNA on healing was not due to differences in cell division or death because similar cell densities were observed in control and Pyk2 siRNA-transfected cultures (supplemental Fig. 3A). Importantly, treatment with 10 ng/ml EGF during healing resulted in similar healing rates in control and Pyk2 siRNA-transfected conditions (Fig. 7A). This shows that the effects of the siRNA are not due to effects on downstream signaling by the EGFR or on the basic motility machinery. Infection of cells with PRNK-expressing adenovirus reduced wound healing by 60% compared with infection with control virus (Fig. 7A). The effect of PRNK expression on healing was not due to differences in cell division or death because similar cell densities were observed in control and PRNK-infected cultures (supplemental Fig. 3B). The PRNK mutant used was tagged with the FLAG epitope; in areas that contained a few uninfected cells, the FLAG-negative cells had migrated further than the FLAG-positive cells (Fig. 7B). The major part of the reduction of motility caused by PRNK was recovered by the addition of exogenous EGF, but motility was still 20% below controls under these conditions. This is probably due to the numerous protein/protein interactions that are expected to be disrupted by the dominant negative approach. Pyk2 and PRNK interact with paxillin (43Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14341-14348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), a component of focal adhesions, and we monitored localization of paxillin by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. In both FLAG-negative and FLAG-positive cells, paxillin was observed in small puncta near the base of the cell that co-localized with termini of actin fibers (supplemental Fig. 3C), indicating that PRNK expression does not cause any major perturbation of focal adhesions. Because inhibition of Pyk2 signaling both by siRNA and the dominant negative PRNK resulted in inhibition of healing, we con"

Pegg A.E. Tainer J.A. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 1100-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Human AGT, also called MGMT, interferes with alkylating chemotherapies making it a target for anticancer drug design (1Tubbs J.L. Pegg A.E. Tainer J.A.

Bull. 2008; 85: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). AGTs are ubiquitous suicide enzymes that mediate the irreversible transfer of the alkyl group to a reactive cysteine within a highly conserved PCHRV active site sequence motif by a direct reversal mechanism, featuring sequence-independent minor-groove binding to a helix-turn-helix motif and flipping of the damaged nucleotide (3Daniels D.S.

The vpAtl protein shares 47% sequence identity with spAtl1 and features a PWFRV active site sequence motif (Fig. 1A). We demonstrate that the structure of vpAtl is highly analogous to the AGT fold and that this bacterial protein is capable of tightly binding to O6-mG-containing DNA and disrupting its repair by human AGT. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrate the importance of highly conserved residues Tyr23 and Arg37 for binding to alkylated DNA. In addition, the NMR data further suggest that the O6-mG recognition cavity of bacterial ATLs exhibits some conformational flexibility, which may confer broader specificity for various alkyl guanine lesions. To our knowledge, this work represents the first structural characterization of a bacterial ATL.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESComplete details of the methods used in this work are provided in the supplemental material.Sample PreparationThe cloning, expression, and purification of isotopically enriched protein samples of a 100-residue construct from the A79_1377 gene of V. parahaemolyticus AQ3810 (Northeast Structural Genomics code, VpR247; vpAtl) plus C-terminal affinity tag (LEHHHHHH) was performed following standard protocols of the Northeast Structural Genomics consortium (12Acton T.B.

Samples of [U-13C,15N]- and [U(5%)-13C, (100%)-15N]vpAtl for NMR spectroscopy were concentrated by ultracentrifugation to 0.90 to 0.94 mm in 95% H2O, 5% 2H2O solution containing 20 mm MES, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm CaCl2 (pH 6.5). Analytical gel filtration chromatography, static light scattering (supplemental Fig. S1), and one-dimensional 15N T1 and T2 relaxation data (supplemental Fig. S2) demonstrate that the protein is monomeric in solution under the conditions used in the NMR studies. Single residue mutations of vpAtl (Y23A, Y23F, R37A, and W54A) were cloned using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and expressed and purified following the same protocols used for the wild type protein.NMR Spectroscopy and Resonance AssignmentAll NMR spectra were collected at 25 °C on Bruker AVANCE 600- and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with 1.7-mm TCI and 5-mm TXI cryoprobes, respectively, and a Varian INOVA 600-MHz instrument with a 5-mm HCN cold probe, and referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid. Complete 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments for vpAtl were determined using conventional triple resonance NMR methods. Backbone assignments were made by combined use of AutoAssign 2.4.0 (13Moseley H.N. Monleon D. Montelione G.T.

Histidine tautomeric states were elucidated by two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence spectroscopy (15Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Meadow N.D. Roseman S.

The global goodness-of-fit of the final structure ensembles with the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) peak list data were determined using the RPF analysis program (23Huang Y.J.

The final refined ensemble of 20 structures (excluding the C-terminal His6) was deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 2KIF). All structure figures were made using PyMOL.15N Relaxation MeasurementsResidue-specific longitudinal and transverse 15N relaxation rates (R1 and R2) as well as 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE values were obtained on [U(5%)-13C, (100%)-15N]vpAtl at a 15N Larmor frequency of 60.8 MHz using standard two-dimensional gradient experiments (24Farrow N.A.

Pegg A.E. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2001; 38: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (1.0 ml), incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg of hemocyanin, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 μg of 3H-methylated calf thymus DNA, and different amounts of purified ATLs. Ten microliters of purified hAGT (0.5 pmol) were added to the above reaction mixture, and incubation was continued for 60 min at 37 °C and assayed for alkyltransferase activity.DISCUSSIONThe results on vpAtl presented here demonstrate a high degree of structural conservation between bacterial and yeast ATLs and demonstrate that vpAtl exhibits the hallmark biochemical behavior of ATLs. Furthermore, mutation of highly conserved residues Tyr23 or Arg37 to alanine abolishes the ability of vpAtl to block methylated DNA repair by human AGT, and the affinity of the Y23F mutant for methylated DNA demonstrates the necessity of a bulky aromatic residue in this position. To our knowledge, this is the first mutagenesis study examining these critical residues in ATLs and their roles in binding to O6-mG DNA and blocking human AGT activity. Taken together, our structural and mutagenesis results provide strong evidence for a conserved mechanism of ATL binding to alkylated DNA mediated by critical tyrosine and arginine residues and involving the flipping out of the damaged base (10Tubbs J.L. Latypov V. Kanugula S. Butt A. Melikishvili M. Kraehenbuehl R. Fleck O. Marriott A. Watson A.J. Verbeek B. McGown G. Thorncroft M. Santibanez-Koref M.F. Millington C. Arvai A.S. Kroeger M.D. Peterson L.A. Williams D.M. Fried M.G. Margison G.P. Pegg A.E. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2009; 459: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Like several other organisms, including E. coli, V. parahaemolyticus possesses genes for both ATL and AGT. It was recently shown that repair of O6-alkylguanine lesions in E. coli is segregated between the direct repair (AGT) and ATL-coupled NER pathways on the basis of the size of the alkyl group, with the latter repairing O6-alkylguanine adducts larger in size than a methyl group, which are poor substrates for bacterial AGTs (11Mazon G. Philippin G. Cadet J. Gasparutto D. Fuchs R.P. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, the high structural similarity between free vpAtl and free and bound spAtl1 suggests that vpAtl also mediates O6-alkylguanine repair by recruitment of proteins involved in NER. Hence, we postulate that vpAtl is also capable of interacting with a broad range of O6-alkylguanine substrates and likely mediates an analogous cross-talk between alkyltransferase and NER repair pathways. In this scenario, vpAtl would function to channel bulkier O6-alkylguanine lesions into the NER pathway. Conformational dynamics within the recognition cavity of apo-ATL, revealed for the first time by this structural NMR study, confer functional plasticity that may be essential for providing its wider range of guanine lesion specificity.In light of the recent structural and biochemical characterization of S. pombe Atl1 and the predicted occurrence of ATLs in archaea (10Tubbs J.L. Latypov V. Kanugula S. Butt A. Melikishvili M. Kraehenbuehl R. Fleck O. Marriott A. Watson A.J. Verbeek B. McGown G. Thorncroft M. Santibanez-Koref M.F. Millington C. Arvai A.S.

Nature. 2009; 459: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), our results for vpAtl also provide further support for the hypothesis that ATLs are an ancient class of nonenzymatic proteins at the interface of the base and nucleotide excision repair pathways for DNA repair. These results thus help provide a unified understanding of DNA damage responses, which has been a major goal for the structural biology of DNA repair since the discovery of base and nucleotide excision repair pathways (39Huffman J.L.

Sumoylation does not affect localization of TCERG1 to the splicing factor-rich nuclear speckles or the alternative splicing function of TCERG1. However, mutation of the SUMO acceptor lysine residues enhanced TCERG1 transcriptional activity, indicating that SUMO modification negatively regulates TCERG1 transcriptional activity.

The finger domain contributes to the pH-dependent gating and is linked via this contact zone to the rest of the protein. We found that mutation to Cys of residues in this region led to decreased channel expression and current amplitudes.

This current inhibition was not due to changes in acid-sensing ion channel pH dependence or unitary conductance and was likely due to a decrease of the probability of channel opening.

Although protons are the only ASIC activators identified so far, ASIC activity is known to be modulated by many different mechanisms. A study on ASIC2a showed that Zn2+ shifts the pH dependence of activation to less acidic values and that for this effect two His residues are critical, His-162 and His-339 (15Baron A. Schaefer L.

His-162 of ASIC2a corresponds to His-163 in human ASIC1a (hASIC1a) and is conserved in all ASICs but not in other epithelial Na+ channel/degenerin family members. Analysis of the ASIC structure (4Gonzales E.B. Kawate T. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 460: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 5Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) shows that His-163 is located at a point that connects three structural domains of the ASIC extracellular loop, the finger, the β-ball, and the upper part of the palm. Fig. 1, A and B, are based on a human ASIC1a homology model derived from the 2QTS chicken ASIC1 structure (see “Experimental Procedures”; stereo views of Fig. 1, A and B are shown in supplemental Fig. S1) (5Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A also indicates the names of the different ASIC domains, as they were introduced in the initial ASIC structure paper (5Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). The palm (yellow in Fig. 1A) stretches vertically from the membrane up to the knuckle (turquoise) along the central vertical axis of the channel and contains a lower β-sheet and an upper β-sheet that interacts with the β-ball (orange). The β-ball is a sphere formed by several crossing β-strands and loops and is located at the same distance from the membrane as the upper palm, between the upper palm, the thumb, and the finger. The main part of the finger (Fig. 1A, purple) consists of residues 100–165 and includes the α-helices α1–α3 and is connected covalently to the rest of the protein in the zone around His-163 that we name in this study “finger-ball interaction zone” via a first loop to the β-ball (black in Fig. 1B) and via a second loop, which contains His-163, to the upper palm (gray in Fig. 1B). A second part of the finger is formed by a stretch of a loop between the palm and the β-ball that points toward the thumb region (the thumb is green in Fig. 1A) and corresponds to residues 229–244. Residues 223–229, which are at the interface between the upper palm and this loop of the finger, form the third loop in the finger-ball interaction zone (brown in Fig. 1B). Thus, three peptide chains contribute to the finger-ball interaction zone, which is shown in a close-up in Fig. 1B. His-163, which is part of the second chain, forms hydrogen bonds with both Asn-96 of the first and Gln-225 of the third peptide chains. Fig. 1C shows sequence alignments of these three segments, illustrating their high degree of conservation. Because the finger domain contributes to pH-dependent gating (16Paukert M. Chen X.

To understand the function of His-163 and its immediate surroundings, we introduced Cys residues by site-directed mutagenesis, probed them with Cd2+, which can bind to Cys, and with methane thiosulfonate sulfhydryl reagents and analyzed the effects on channel expression and function.

Oocytes were surgically removed from the ovarian tissue of female X. laevis, which had been anesthetized by immersion in MS-222 (2 g liter−1; Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland). The oocytes were defolliculated, and healthy stage V and VI Xenopus oocytes were isolated and pressure-injected with 10 ng of cRNA or as indicated, and oocytes were kept in modified Barth solution during the expression phase. In a first series of experiments, several mutants had shown substantially lower acid-induced currents than ASIC wild type (WT). To allow a sufficiently high expression level of the mutants for functional analysis, we subcloned all mutant constructs in a vector for transcription that contained 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of Xenopus β-globin, which is known to increase expression. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2, the use of the vector containing the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of Xenopus β-globin induced for both hASIC1a and a tested mutant (H163C) an increase in total and cell surface expression and increased the maximal current amplitude. 45 oocytes per condition were used, and the complete protocol was performed on ice. Oocytes were washed three times with modified Barth solution and then incubated in biotinylation buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH adjusted to 9.5) containing 1 μg/ml EZ-link sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) for 15 min. The oocytes were then washed twice and incubated for 5 min in quench buffer (0.192 m glycine, 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in modified Barth solution) to stop the biotinylation reaction. Oocytes were then lysed in 20 μl of lysis buffer per oocyte (1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. During the centrifugation step, 50 μl of ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) per condition were washed with the lysis buffer, and the supernatant from centrifugation was added to the washed beads. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and 40 μl of supernatant (corresponding to ∼5% of the volume of the supernatant, representing the intracellular protein fraction) per condition were mixed with protein sample buffer, whereas the beads (containing biotinylated membrane protein fraction) were washed three times with the lysis buffer and then mixed with protein sample buffer. After boiling at 95 °C for 5 min, the samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The polypeptides were exposed to rabbit anti-ASIC1 primary antibody (MTY19, 1:1000) that recognizes a C-terminal epitope of hASIC1 (11Wemmie J.A. Askwith C.C. Lamani E. Cassell M.D. Freeman Jr., J.H. Welsh M.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5496-5502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:20,000, Amersham Biosciences) as secondary antibody and visualized using SuperSignal® West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Electrophysiological measurements were performed 1–2 days after cRNA injection. Macroscopic currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique at a holding potential of −60 mV with a Dagan TEV-200 amplifier (Minneapolis, MN) equipped with two bath electrodes. Acidic (stimulation) solutions were applied once every minute for 5 s, and in-between the recording chamber was perfused with the conditioning solution. The standard bath solution contained in mm, 110 NaCl, 2.0 CaCl2, 10 Hepes-NaOH (or MES-NaOH for pH < 6.8), and pH was adjusted with NaOH to the indicated values. Oocytes were placed in a recording chamber (300 μl) and perfused by gravity at 8 ml/min. The pipette solution contained 1 m KCl. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Kimble Glass Inc., Germany). Kaleidagraph (Synergy software) was used to fit the pH activation curves to the Hill equation: I = Imax/(1 + (10−pH 50/10−pH)nH), where Imax is the maximal current, pH 50 is the pH that induces half-maximal current, and nH is the Hill coefficient. Steady-state inactivation curves were fitted by an analogous equation. The Cd2+ inhibition curves were fitted to the Hill equation: I = I0/(1 + ([Cd2+]/IC50)nH), where I0 is the current in the absence of Cd2+, IC50 is the Cd2+ concentration that induces 50% inhibition, and nH is the Hill coefficient. The outside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to obtain single-channel data. Before recording, the vitelline layer of the oocyte was removed. The extracellular solution for outside-out patches contained in mm, 110 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 10 Hepes-NaOH, and 10 MES-NaOH, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 or to the stimulating pH values. Changes of external solutions of outside-out patches were made using the Rapid Solution Changer RSC-200 (Biologic, Grenoble, France). The pipette solution contained in mm, 75 CsF, 17 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 EGTA, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.35. Pipettes for patch clamp experiments were pulled from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Stevenage, UK). In patch clamp experiments, currents were recorded with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Electronic, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) and filtered at 100 Hz for analysis. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences between WT and mutant forms of ASIC1a and between different treatments were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett post hoc test, using Kaleidagraph (Synergy software). Methanethiosulfonate reagents were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Canada), and other reagents were from Sigma, Fluka, or Applichem. For the planning of the experiments and the interpretation of the data, a homology model of human ASIC1a was created based on the first chicken ASIC1 structure with Protein Data Bank code 2QTS (5Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) using the program Modeler 9 version 5 (19Martí-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sánchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). Five models were generated and analyzed with Dope (20Shen M.Y. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2507-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar) and Anolea (21Melo F. Feytmans E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and the model with the best overall score was selected. The homology model of human ASIC1a is very similar to the experimentally determined structure of chicken ASIC1a, due to very high sequence identity (90%). After superimposition on the Cα atoms, the root mean square deviation between the template crystal structure and the homology model was 0.5 Å. An analysis of the model by the program PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that 92.4% of its residues are in the favorable regions, 7.5% in the generously and additionally allowed regions, and only 0.2% (2 residues) are in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The modeling was performed within the Protein Modeling Facility of the University of Lausanne. Both published chicken ASIC1 structures share a high similarity in the region around His-163 (4Gonzales E.B. Kawate T. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 460: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 5Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). His-163 and residues in its immediate environment in the finger-ball interaction zone were mutated to Cys. Among the mutated residues, we distinguished two categories based on their localization in the model of the ASIC structure (Fig. 1B; for model generation and testing see “Experimental Procedures”). Residues of category I are oriented toward the center of the finger-ball interaction zone (Asn-94, Asn-96, Gly-162, His-163, Gln-225, and Tyr-229) or form a contact between two of the strands (Ser-101 and Glu-228). These residues are shown as “ball and stick” in Fig. 1B. Except for Gly-162, they interact with other residues by H-bonds (blue lines in Fig. 1B). The other residues, constituting category II, are oriented toward the outside of this domain (Leu-95, Glu-97, Asp-164, Ile-224, and Gln-226; shown in “stick” representation in Fig. 1B). WT or mutant ASIC1a was expressed in X. laevis oocytes. The expression of WT and mutant ASIC1a after injection of the same amount of cRNA was analyzed by Western blot. Before cell lysis, cell surface-expressed proteins were marked by biotinylation to allow their isolation. Fig. 2A shows Western blots of the intracellular pool and of the surface-expressed ASIC protein for ASIC1a WT and the different mutations. The ASIC1-specific antibody labeled a double band of an apparent molecular mass close to 70 kDa, corresponding to the single subunit. The existence of ASIC1a double bands has been reported previously and has been attributed to heterogeneous glycosylation (23Kadurin I. Golubovic A. Leisle L. Schindelin H. Gründer S. Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The intensity of the bands indicates that many mutants had expression levels that were comparable with that of WT except for the mutants N96C, S101C, and E228C, which showed strongly decreased protein expression. Fig. 2B shows the peak current amplitude induced by acidification to pH 4.5 as black bars for category I mutants and gray bars for category II mutants. The peak current amplitude of all mutant ASICs except for L95C and Q226C was decreased at least 3-fold with respect to WT (Fig. 2B), indicating that these mutations decreased channel expression or function. For most mutants, peak current amplitude correlated with the cell surface expression level (Fig. 2). Exceptions were H163C and Y229C, which had low current amplitudes despite a WT-comparable level of cell surface expression, indicating that these mutations reduced the current amplitude per channel number at the cell surface. Comparison of the unbound and the bound fractions demonstrated that mutants with low cell surface expression levels also had low intracellular expressions levels, indicating that the low cell surface expression was not due to an impaired insertion of the protein in the plasma membrane but rather due to an impaired protein synthesis or stability. This analysis shows that an intact finger-ball interaction zone is required for normal expression of the ASIC1a protein. We exposed ASIC1a WT and Cys mutant-expressing oocytes to Cd2+ or to the sulfhydryl reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) to test whether these residues were accessible and whether the binding of Cd2+ or the chemical modification affected channel function. Cadmium inhibited at micromolar concentrations some of the mutants completely, although at 10 mm it inhibited only ∼30% of the ASIC1a WT current, as illustrated by the inhibition curves in Fig. 3A. The inhibition by Cd2+ was rapidly reversible upon washout of Cd2+ (data not shown). Because Cd2+ shifted the pH dependence of activation of some mutants (see below, Fig. 6B), we measured Cd2+ inhibition as the inhibition of the pH 4.5-induced peak current amplitude. Acidification to pH 4.5 induced maximal current responses in all mutants. The observed current inhibition by Cd2+ (Fig. 3, A and B) therefore represents the inhibition of the maximal peak current amplitude and is not due to possible shifts in the pH dependence of activation induced by Cd2+. Concentrations of half-maximal inhibition (IC50) obtained from this analysis are shown in Fig. 3B. In Fig. 3B, mutations of category I and II residues are shown as black and gray symbols, respectively. The IC50 values were lower as compared with WT for all mutants except for L95C, E97C, D164C, and I224C, indicating that except for these four residues the engineered Cys residues interacted with Cd2+. Category I mutants generally had a higher apparent affinity for Cd2+ than category II mutants. Most of the category I residues point toward His-163 and may, when mutated to Cys, form a Cd2+-binding site together with His-163. We hypothesized that for this reason several category I residue mutations had a higher apparent Cd2+ affinity than H163C. We tested this hypothesis for two residues, Asn-96 and Gln-225 by mutating His-163 to Asn and combining this mutation with the mutation N96C or Q225C. We had chosen the conservative mutation H163N because this mutant was reported as expressing WT-comparable currents and pH dependence (16Paukert M. Chen X. Polleichtner G. Schindelin H. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 572-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and therefore should allow the construction of functional double mutants. The H163N mutation reduced the Cd2+ affinity by ∼5-fold as compared with the H163C mutant, but it still showed 10-fold higher Cd2+ affinity than the WT (filled squares in Fig. 3B). The IC50 of Cd2+ inhibition of the double mutant H163N/N96C was not different from the single N96C mutant (Fig. 3B); however, the combination of the Q225C mutation with the H163N mutation increased the IC50 by ∼30-fold. This indicates that the high apparent affinity for Cd2+ inhibition of Q225C depends on the presence of His-163. These two control experiments show that at least for some, but clearly not all category I residues, the high apparent Cd2+ affinity was due to a chelation of Cd2+ between the engineered Cys and His-163. S101C and E228C displayed the lowest apparent Cd2+ affinity of category I mutants. They form an H-bond connecting loop 1 and 3 and are too far from His-163 to chelate Cd2+ together with His-163. Gln-226 points away from this domain and interacts with the knuckle domain of the adjacent subunit. It may form a Cd2+-chelating site together with residues from the neighboring knuckle, which might be the cause of its relatively high apparent affinity for Cd2+.FIGURE 6Effects of Cd2+ and MTSET on ASIC pH dependence.

MTSET fits into a cylinder with a radius of 3 Å and a height of 10 Å and is much larger than Cd2+, whose Pauling radius is 0.65 Å. MTSET forms a disulfide bond with Cys residues, thereby adding the trimethylammonium-ethyl group. Fig. 3C shows current traces of responses to acidic stimulation of different pH values of an oocyte expressing ASIC1a H163C, before and after a 5-min exposure to 1 mm MTSET. In the H163C mutant, MTSET modification strongly inhibited the peak current amplitudes (note the difference in scale of the traces in Fig. 3C), demonstrating that the residue is accessible and that its modification impaired channel function. Fig. 3D summarizes the effects of MTSET on the maximal peak current amplitude of different mutants. Category II mutants showed less than 30% inhibition except for E97C, which was inhibited by ∼50%. In contrast, all category I residue mutants were inhibited by more than 40%. We determined the kinetics of the decrease of the pH 5.5-induced current amplitude for most category I mutants. For this, we induced channel activation every 60 s by a 5-s acidification to pH 5.5, and we added MTSET between these acidification steps at a concentration <1 mm (e.g. 0.15 mm for Q225C) that allowed resolution of the kinetics of the MTSET-induced current decrease. Typical current traces of such an experiment are shown in supplemental Fig. S3A, and the kinetics of the pH 5.5-induced current decrease of three mutants are shown in supplemental Fig. S3B. From the fit to the kinetics, we calculated the rate of MTSET-induced current decrease in units of min−1 m−1 to allow quantitative comparison of the kinetics measured at different MTSET concentrations. This analysis yielded reaction rates of ∼1500–3000 min−1 m−1 for most mutants, a slightly higher rate for E228C, and an ∼10-fold higher rate for N96C (supplemental Fig. S3C). For the mutant with the lowest observed rate, H163C, 1540 ± 154 min−1 m−1, exposure to 1 mm MTSET results in 95% of maximal modification after 2 min and 100% after 5 min, as calculated based on a mono-exponential time course. This indicates that for these mutants modification was complete after 5 min of exposure to 1 mm MTSET. The 10-fold higher rate of current decrease in N96C is either due to better accessibility or to higher reactivity of the Cys at position 96. To test whether His-163 and close residues were also accessible to reagents larger than MTSET, we exposed the His-163 and Gln-225 mutants to 2-(triethylammonium)-ethyl methanethiosulfonate and 2-(tributylammonium)-ethyl methanethiosulfonate, which contain a triethylammonium and tributylammonium group, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 4A. These reagents decreased the maximal peak current amplitude to a similar degree as did MTSET (Fig. 4B), indicating that these reagents can equally well reach H163C and Q225C as does MTSET. The rate of current decrease due to MTSET exposure depends on the accessibility of the engineered Cys residue and may differ at different functional states of the chan"
https://openalex.org/W2040633327,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) was discovered in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes in the 1960s (Friedberg et al., 2005). The process corrects a wide spectrum of damage to DNA bases that results in distortions in the native conformation of DNA, including damage induced by ultraviolet (UV) light and by a plethora of chemicals. NER comprises two distinct subpathways. Global genome repair (GGR) repairs lesions in regions of the genome that are transcriptionally silent, and transcription-coupled repair (TCR) repairs lesions in regions of the genome that are transcriptionally active. A key difference between these two NER pathways is the molecular mechanism used to recognize the damaged base (designated by a red star in the SnapShot figure)."
