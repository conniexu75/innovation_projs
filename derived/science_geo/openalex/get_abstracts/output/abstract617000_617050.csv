Young children are also particularly susceptible to infections, warranting more analyses of immune system development early in life. Such analyses mostly have been performed in mouse models or human cord blood samples, but these cannot account for the complex environmental exposures influencing human newborns after birth. Here, we performed longitudinal analyses in 100 newborn children, sampled up to 4 times during their first 3 months of life. From 100 μL of blood, we analyze the development of 58 immune cell populations by mass cytometry and 267 plasma proteins by immunoassays, uncovering drastic changes not predictable from cord blood measurements but following a stereotypic pattern. Preterm and term children differ at birth but converge onto a shared trajectory, seemingly driven by microbial interactions and hampered by early gut bacterial dysbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2888200508,"How transcription affects genome 3D organization is not well understood. We found that during influenza A (IAV) infection, rampant transcription rapidly reorganizes host cell chromatin interactions. These changes occur at the ends of highly transcribed genes, where global inhibition of transcription termination by IAV NS1 protein causes readthrough transcription for hundreds of kilobases. In these readthrough regions, elongating RNA polymerase II disrupts chromatin interactions by inducing cohesin displacement from CTCF sites, leading to locus decompaction. Readthrough transcription into heterochromatin regions switches them from the inert (B) to the permissive (A) chromatin compartment and enables transcription factor binding. Data from non-viral transcription stimuli show that transcription similarly affects cohesin-mediated chromatin contacts within gene bodies. Conversely, inhibition of transcription elongation allows cohesin to accumulate at previously transcribed intragenic CTCF sites and to mediate chromatin looping and compaction. Our data indicate that transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II remodels genome 3D architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2888515069,"Aging is a major risk factor for both genetic and sporadic neurodegenerative disorders. However, it is unclear how aging interacts with genetic predispositions to promote neurodegeneration. Here, we investigate how partial loss of function of TBK1, a major genetic cause for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) comorbidity, leads to age-dependent neurodegeneration. We show that TBK1 is an endogenous inhibitor of RIPK1 and the embryonic lethality of Tbk1-/- mice is dependent on RIPK1 kinase activity. In aging human brains, another endogenous RIPK1 inhibitor, TAK1, exhibits a marked decrease in expression. We show that in Tbk1+/- mice, the reduced myeloid TAK1 expression promotes all the key hallmarks of ALS/FTD, including neuroinflammation, TDP-43 aggregation, axonal degeneration, neuronal loss, and behavior deficits, which are blocked upon inhibition of RIPK1. Thus, aging facilitates RIPK1 activation by reducing TAK1 expression, which cooperates with genetic risk factors to promote the onset of ALS/FTD."

Organism viability requires faithful chromosome segregation among germline and somatic cells. Chromosome segregation errors can lead to chromosome damage and aneuploidy. Aneuploidy is usually associated with impaired cellular fitness, and indeed when present throughout an organism typically results in embryonic lethality (Hassold and Jacobs, 1984Hassold T.J. Jacobs P.A. Trisomy in man.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 69-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, Williams et al., 2008Williams B.R. Prabhu V.R. Hunter K.E. Glazier C.M. Whittaker C.A. Housman D.E. Amon A. Aneuploidy affects proliferation and spontaneous immortalization in mammalian cells.Science. 2008; 322: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). However, chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy are also prevalent in cancer, in which aneuploidy is suspected to enhance cellular fitness (Knouse et al., 2017Knouse K.A. Davoli T. Elledge S.J. Amon A. Aneuploidy in cancer: Seq-ing answers to old questions.Annu. Rev. Cancer Biol. 2017; 1: 335-354Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although these consequences of aneuploidy are paradoxical at the cellular level, they are uniformly adverse for the organism. As such, chromosome segregation is subject to meticulous execution and stringent regulation. The central mediators of chromosome segregation are the microtubules of the mitotic spindle and the kinetochores of sister chromatids. Interactions between microtubules and kinetochores drive the partitioning of sister chromatids into separate daughter cells. In order for sister chromatids to segregate properly, their kinetochores must attach to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles. However, microtubules capture kinetochores randomly, making it possible for a given kinetochore to attach to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole as the sister kinetochore, both spindle poles, or neither spindle pole. In contrast to proper attachments, which produce tension across sister kinetochores, most improper attachments fail to produce such tension. In order to eliminate aberrant attachments, the cell relies on the cooperative functions of error correction and the spindle assembly checkpoint. The error correction pathway severs microtubule-kinetochore attachments that are not under tension while the spindle assembly checkpoint prevents anaphase onset until all kinetochores are stably bound to microtubules (Cheeseman et al., 2002Cheeseman I.M.

The most common chromosome segregation error occurs when a merotelic attachment, in which a kinetochore is bound by microtubules emanating from both spindle poles, persists into anaphase (Cimini et al., 2001Cimini D. Howell B. Maddox P. Khodjakov A. Degrassi F. Salmon E.D. Merotelic kinetochore orientation is a major mechanism of aneuploidy in mitotic mammalian tissue cells.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Although merotelic attachments can be a natural consequence of unbiased microtubule-kinetochore capture, they form more frequently when spindle formation is impaired, such as when centrosome separation is delayed or when a cell enters mitosis with supernumerary centrosomes (Ganem et al., 2009Ganem N.J.

Cell. 2012; 23: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Some merotelic attachments can be detected and corrected by the error correction pathway as mitosis progresses (Cimini et al., 2003Cimini D. Moree B. Canman J.C. Salmon E.D.

Aurora kinase promotes turnover of kinetochore microtubules to reduce chromosome segregation errors.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, because a merotelically attached kinetochore is bound by microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles, it is possible for the kinetochore to be stretched sufficiently to escape error correction. As a result, these merotelic attachments can persist into anaphase. Depending on the ratio of microtubules from each spindle pole bound to a persistent merotelic attachment, the affected chromosome may lag behind the two main masses of segregating chromosomes during anaphase and potentially segregate into the wrong daughter cell (Cimini et al., 2004Cimini D.

Biol. 2004; 14: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). If the lagging chromosome is separated sufficiently from the other segregating chromosomes, it will not be incorporated into the main nucleus but instead form a separate micronucleus during telophase. Regardless of whether or not the lagging chromosome segregates into the correct daughter cell, it can experience extensive DNA damage during cytokinesis or once entrapped in a micronucleus (Crasta et al., 2012Crasta K.

Although lagging chromosomes and micronuclei are observed in less than 1% of mitoses in untransformed cell lines, their frequency can exceed 50% in many cancer cell lines (Cimini et al., 2001Cimini D.

Given that the key mediators of chromosome segregation all act within the cell, one might assume that this process is independent of the external environment. However, factors acting at the cell cortex and beyond are known to influence various aspects of chromosome segregation. For example, the pattern by which cells adhere to the extracellular matrix, transduced intracellularly via integrins, is known to influence the orientation of the mitotic spindle and the cell division axis in both cultured cells and tissues (Lechler and Fuchs, 2005Lechler T. Fuchs E. Asymmetric cell divisions promote stratification and differentiation of mammalian skin.Nature. 2005; 437: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, Théry et al., 2005Théry M.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Additionally, many cultured cells round during mitosis (Stewart et al., 2011Stewart M.P. Helenius J. Toyoda Y. Ramanathan S.P. Muller D.J. Hyman A.A. Hydrostatic pressure and the actomyosin cortex drive mitotic cell rounding.Nature. 2011; 469: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Preventing this process through mechanical confinement or cytoskeletal perturbations can interfere with various aspects of chromosome segregation (Itabashi et al., 2012Itabashi T. Terada Y. Kuwana K. Kan T. Shimoyama I. Ishiwata S. Mechanical impulses can control metaphase progression in a mammalian cell.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Baum B. Mitotic rounding alters cell geometry to ensure efficient bipolar spindle formation.Dev. Cell. 2013; 25: 270-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). There is also evidence to suggest that chromosome segregation fidelity is subject to higher regulation from the tissue environment. Hepatocytes are polyploid and harbor supernumerary centrosomes. Consistent with the established correlation between supernumerary centrosomes and chromosome missegregation in cultured cells, studies of hepatocytes in culture have shown high levels of chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy (Duncan et al., 2010Duncan A.W. Taylor M.H. Hickey R.D. Hanlon Newell A.E. Lenzi M.L. Olson S.B. Finegold M.J. Grompe M.

Frequent aneuploidy among normal human hepatocytes.Gastroenterology. 2012; 142: 25-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, single-cell sequencing of hepatocytes in the adult liver has revealed only low levels of aneuploidy (Knouse et al., 2014Knouse K.A. Wu J. Whittaker C.A. Amon A. Single cell sequencing reveals low levels of aneuploidy across mammalian tissues.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 13409-13414Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In a similar vein, although many cancer cells have high levels of chromosome missegregation—a condition known as chromosome instability—there is no universal explanation for its presence. Indeed, many chromosomally unstable cancer cells have functional spindle assembly checkpoints (Haruki et al., 2001Haruki N. Saito H. Harano T. Nomoto S. Takahashi T. Osada H. Fujii Y. Takahashi T.

Johnson V.L. Albertella M. Taylor S.S. Aneuploid colon cancer cells have a robust spindle checkpoint.EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These observations warrant investigating chromosome segregation fidelity directly in tissues. Here, we examine chromosome segregation fidelity across multiple mammalian cell types within their native tissues and as cultured cells. We find that epithelial cells have high chromosome segregation fidelity in tissues but that this is lost when tissue structure is disrupted. Using organoid culture systems, we show that tissue architecture, specifically integrin function, is required for chromosome segregation fidelity in epithelia. We find that tissue architecture enhances the correction of merotelic attachments, and that this is especially important for accurate chromosome segregation in the polyploid liver. Our results highlight the importance of external factors in governing chromosome segregation fidelity in epithelia, suggest that disruption of tissue architecture could underlie chromosome instability in cancer, and reveal the limitations of cell culture systems for faithful recapitulation of fundamental cellular processes. To evaluate chromosome segregation in primary cells, we isolated five proliferative tissues from mouse: mammary gland during pregnancy, embryonic skin, neonatal liver, embryonic brain, and lymph nodes during an immune response. We then analyzed the mitoses of mammary epithelial cells, keratinocytes, hepatocytes, neural progenitor cells, and T cells in their native tissues and after the cells had been dissociated and expanded in culture for up to 48 hr (Figure 1A). We quantified chromosomes missegregation in two different ways: (1) lagging chromosomes in anaphase and (2) micronuclei in telophase (Figure 1B). For mammary gland, skin, and neonatal liver, we never observed lagging chromosomes and micronuclei in the tissue. However, we observed significant increases in these defects when epithelial cells from these tissues were dissociated and expanded in culture (Figures 1B and 1C). For embryonic brain and lymph node, we observed a low frequency of chromosome segregation defects in the tissues, and these defects increased slightly but not significantly when the cells were dissociated and expanded in culture (Figure 1B, note that we never observed micronuclei in lymphocytes, which could be due to these cells having short anaphase spindles that favor the incorporation of lagging chromosomes into the main nuclei during telophase). Importantly, the increase in chromosome missegregation in dissociated cells was not secondary to polyploidization or supernumerary centrosomes, as there was little to no increase in the number of mitotic cells harboring supernumerary centrosomes within the first 48 hr of culture (Figure S1A). These results lead to the surprising conclusion that chromosome segregation fidelity depends on the tissue environment for several cell types.Figure S1Centrosome Number in Mitotic Epithelial Cells in the Presence and Absence of Tissue Architecture, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Quantification of centrosome number (ϒtubulin foci) in prometaphase cells in tissue and dissociated cells from mammary gland, skin, neonatal liver, embryonic brain, and lymph node. n = 1 biological replicate with 50 prometaphase cells per condition.(B) Quantification of centrosome number (ϒtubulin foci) in prometaphase mammary epithelial cells in immature and mature spheroids. n = 1 biological replicate with 50 prometaphase cells per condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Quantification of centrosome number (ϒtubulin foci) in prometaphase cells in tissue and dissociated cells from mammary gland, skin, neonatal liver, embryonic brain, and lymph node. n = 1 biological replicate with 50 prometaphase cells per condition.

The tissue and cell culture environments differ in many ways. When cells are dissociated from their tissues and expanded in culture, they lose their canonical adhesions to other cells and the extracellular matrix, and consequently may lose their native shape and polarity. Beyond these structural changes, cells in culture are exposed to different extracellular signals and atmosphere compared to cells in tissues. Any or all of these alterations could in principle influence chromosome segregation. However, the observation that the tissue environment was important for chromosome segregation fidelity in some but not all cell types provided insight into the tissue dependence. The cell types that experienced increased chromosome missegregation upon dissociation—mammary epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and neonatal hepatocytes—naturally divide within an epithelium and maintain adhesions to neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix when doing so (Ragkousi and Gibson, 2014Ragkousi K. Gibson M.C. Cell division and the maintenance of epithelial order.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 207: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). In contrast, cell types for which the tissue environment contributed little to chromosomes segregation fidelity—neural progenitor cells and T cells—normally migrate to less structured areas, the ventricular zone and lymph node, respectively, to divide (Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009Kriegstein A. Alvarez-Buylla A. The glial nature of embryonic and adult neural stem cells.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 149-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar, Neumann et al., 1992Neumann C.M.

Immunopharmacol. 1992; 14: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). We hypothesized that disruption of epithelial architecture causes chromosome missegregation in cells that naturally divide within an epithelium. To test this, we cultured mammary epithelial cells in Matrigel as this produces spheroids that resemble the acini of the mammary epithelium (Jechlinger et al., 2009Jechlinger M. Podsypanina K. Varmus H. Regulation of transgenes in three-dimensional cultures of primary mouse mammary cells demonstrates oncogene dependence and identifies cells that survive deinduction.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After 48 hr in Matrigel, cells formed small clusters that had neither a central lumen nor defined apicobasal polarity (henceforth immature spheroids, Figure 1D). However, after 96 hr in Matrigel the majority of cells formed spheroids with a single-cell layer surrounding a central lumen (henceforth mature spheroids, Figure 1D). These cells had apicobasal polarity as evidenced by the basal localization of the cell-matrix adhesion protein α6 integrin and the apical ribbon of the tight junction protein ZO-1 (Figure 1D). The immature and mature spheroids thus provided conditions that were equivalent in all respects except for the duration of culture in Matrigel and the absence or presence of epithelial architecture. Notably, cells in immature spheroids had similar levels of chromosome missegregation as dissociated cells (Figures 1E and 1B). In contrast, chromosome segregation fidelity was significantly improved in mature spheroids (Figure 1E). As was true for dissociated cells, the increased chromosome missegregation in immature spheroids was not secondary to polyploidization or supernumerary centrosomes (Figure S1B). We conclude that tissue architecture is required for accurate chromosome segregation in epithelia. We next sought to determine which element of tissue architecture was important for chromosome segregation fidelity. Each epithelium is defined by distinct patterns of adhesions between adjacent cells and between cells and the extracellular matrix. These adhesions in turn impart shape and polarity to individual cells (Lee and Streuli, 2014Lee J.L. Streuli C.H. Integrins and epithelial cell polarity.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 3217-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We tested whether changes in cell shape or polarity were responsible for chromosome missegregation upon tissue architecture disruption. To evaluate cell shape, we measured three orthogonal dimensions of interphase and mitotic cells in tissues, dissociated cells, and spheroids. We then calculated the centroid for a given group of cells and performed permutation tests to determine whether different groups of cells had significantly different dimensions. This analysis led to several conclusions. First, in tissues, we observed variable differences in the dimensions of interphase and mitotic cells. In the mammary gland and lymph node, interphase and mitotic cells did not have significantly different dimensions, whereas for skin, neonatal liver, and embryonic brain, the centroids of interphase and mitotic cells differed by approximately 3 μm (Figures 2A and S2A–S2D). Second, dramatic shape changes occurred when cells from all tissues except lymph node transitioned from the tissue to culture (Figures 2A and S2A–S2D). In these cases, the cells spread out and flattened, expanding in the x and y dimensions and decreasing in the z dimension. Once in culture, there was never a significant difference in the shape of interphase and mitotic cells across all cell types (Figures 2A and S2A–S2D). This is in contrast to commonly cultured cell lines, which round up during mitosis (Lancaster et al., 2013Lancaster O.M. Le Berre M. Dimitracopoulos A. Bonazzi D. Zlotek-Zlotkiewicz E. Picone R.

However, the high prevalence of Ent-producing commensal bacteria in the human gut raises the intriguing question regarding a potential host mechanism to beneficially use Ent. We discovered an unexpected and striking role of Ent in supporting growth and the labile iron pool in C. elegans. We show that Ent promotes mitochondrial iron uptake and does so, surprisingly, by binding to the ATP synthase α subunit, which acts inside of mitochondria and independently of ATP synthase.

Extensive studies in recent years, mostly by innovative high-throughput approaches, have revealed the complexity and diversity of the microbes that populate the human gastrointestinal tract, as well as their profound impacts on a broad range of physiological functions in the host (Blanton et al., 2016Blanton L.V.

However, in vivo functional analysis of specific microbial metabolites in host animals, which is important to thoroughly understand the mechanisms underlying the evolution of such relationships and develop therapeutic interventions to microbiota-related human health problems, is challenging and highly desirable. Establishing good animal models is critical for scientists to analyze the functions of individual microbial molecules from a complex milieu (Donia and Fischbach, 2015Donia M.S.

We have previously developed a unique assay system to evaluate the impact of microbiota-produced metabolites on animal development and behaviors, which led to the identification of an intestinal pathway that regulates animal food behaviors in response to deficiency of bacteria-produced vitamin B2 (Qi et al., 2017Qi B. Kniazeva M. Han M. A vitamin-B2-sensing mechanism that regulates gut protease activity to impact animal’s food behavior and growth.eLife. 2017; 6 (Published online June 1, 2017)https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26243Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Enterobactin (Ent) is a catecholate siderophore produced almost exclusively by enterobacteria to scavenge iron from the environment (Wilson et al., 2016Wilson B.R. Bogdan A.R. Miyazawa M. Hashimoto K. Tsuji Y. Siderophores in iron metabolism: From mechanism to therapy potential.Trends Mol. Med. 2016; 22: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The scavenging role of Ent is expected to have a negative impact on iron homeostasis and certain cellular processes in the host, given that siderophores are known to be key virulence mediators of pathogens (Cassat and Skaar, 2013Cassat J.E.

In order to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria that rely on Ent to scavenge iron from host cells, the mammalian immune system produces the Ent-binding protein Lipocalin 2 that sequesters Ent (Bäumler and Sperandio, 2016Bäumler A.J.

Such a defense system may have negative effects on the host iron pool and animal functions (Ellermann and Arthur, 2017Ellermann M. Arthur J.C.

More importantly, this mechanism does not explain how host animals would cope with abundant Ent from non-infectious gut microbiota, of which enterobacteria are the most prevalent commensal microbes in both human and C. elegans (Berg et al., 2016Berg M. Stenuit B. Ho J. Wang A. Parke C. Knight M. Alvarez-Cohen L. Shapira M.

Skurnik D. Picard B. Denamur E. The population genetics of commensal Escherichia coli.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Given the symbiotic relationship between commensal E. coli and the host, one may speculate that an unknown beneficial mechanism has evolved in animals to use bacterial Ent for host iron homeostasis. In this study, by developing a unique and sensitive assay in C. elegans, we discovered an unexpected but logical role of bacterial Ent in supporting animal growth and iron level. We present biochemical and genetic data for a surprising mechanism by which an interaction between Ent and the ATP synthase α subunit facilitates mitochondrial iron uptake both in C. elegans and mammals. We created a unique assay to facilitate the identification of microbial metabolites that benefit growth and development of host animals. Our previous studies revealed that heat-killed (HK) E. coli lacks certain molecules that are collectively required for C. elegans larval growth (Qi et al., 2017Qi B. Kniazeva M. Han M. A vitamin-B2-sensing mechanism that regulates gut protease activity to impact animal’s food behavior and growth.eLife. 2017; 6 (Published online June 1, 2017)https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26243Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Larval growth was recovered when the heat-killed E. coli plate was supplemented with a trace amount of live E. coli, which alone could not support worm growth (Figure 1A), suggesting that the trace amount of live bacteria generated metabolites that rendered the heat-killed food usable. This unique feeding condition was used to search for E. coli mutants that fail to support normal worm growth, potentially due to their inability to provide specific metabolites to benefit host animals. After screening an E. coli single-gene knockout library (Keio collection), we found that worms fed a trace amount of any of the five E. coli mutants with disrupted Ent biosynthesis grew significantly slower (Figures 1B and 1C). Strikingly, the worm growth defects were completely overcome by dietary supplementation of Ent (Figures 1D and S1A). In addition, supplementing with the metabolic intermediate 2,3-DHBA rescued worm growth on entA– but not entF– E. coli (Figures 1C and 1E), confirming that only the final product Ent can provide this benefit to the worm.Figure S1Bacterial Ent Promotes C. elegans Development, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Cartoon diagram of feeding condition, and microscope images showing that worms fed heat-killed E. coli combined with either entA- or entF- mutant E. coli grew slower, and this defect was fully suppressed by Ent supplementation.

Data are represented as mean ± SEM. ∗∗∗p < 0.0001. We then showed that this beneficial role of Ent for worm growth is likely independent of the bacterial usage of Ent as a siderophore. Specifically, disrupting FepA, which is an E. coli outer membrane receptor for ferric Ent (Liu et al., 1993Liu J. Rutz J.M. Feix J.B. Klebba P.E. Permeability properties of a large gated channel within the ferric enterobactin receptor, FepA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 10653-10657Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Figure S1B), did not affect worm development (Figures 1F and S1C). We also found that the entA– and entF– mutant bacteria exhibited no obvious defects in growth under our culture condition or in worm gut colonization (Figures S1D and S1E). Supplementation of two other siderophores (pyoverdine and ferrichrome) failed to generate a similar impact on worm growth (Figures 1G and S1F), indicating the specificity of the observed Ent role. A previous study showed that pyoverdine, a siderophore produced by P. aeruginosa, is toxic to C. elegans by damaging the host mitochondria in liquid culture (Kirienko et al., 2015Kirienko N.V. Ausubel F.M. Ruvkun G. Mitophagy confers resistance to siderophore-mediated killing by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether our negative results with pyoverdine or ferrichrome were mainly due to the toxicity of these siderophores. We thus tested and observed, under our culturing condition with solid medium, no obvious defects in growth (Figure S1F) or mitochondrial morphology (Figure S1G) in C. elegans fed wild-type E. coli and supplemented with pyoverdine or ferrichrome. In addition, we found that Ent supplementation did not disrupt mitochondrial morphology even in liquid culture (Figure S1H), which is distinct from the effect of pyoverdine. An established assay (Schwyn and Neilands, 1987Schwyn B. Neilands J.B. Universal chemical assay for the detection and determination of siderophores.Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4441) Google Scholar) was modified to evaluate the siderophore level in whole worms, and we found that worms fed wild-type E. coli contained a significantly higher level of siderophore than worms fed entF– mutant E. coli (Figure 1H). The production of Ent from E. coli under the culture condition is consistent with a relatively low iron culture media in our experiments, given that high iron level is known to repress Ent biosynthesis (Kwon et al., 1996Kwon O. Hudspeth M.E. Meganathan R. Anaerobic biosynthesis of enterobactin Escherichia coli: Regulation of entC gene expression and evidence against its involvement in menaquinone (vitamin K2) biosynthesis.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3252-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ent supplementation alone did not result in any appreciable effect on the development of worms fed only heat-killed bacteria (Figure S1I), which indicates that heat-killed bacteria lack more than just Ent or any one specific metabolite (Qi et al., 2017Qi B. Kniazeva M. Han M. A vitamin-B2-sensing mechanism that regulates gut protease activity to impact animal’s food behavior and growth.eLife. 2017; 6 (Published online June 1, 2017)https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26243Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Conversely, worms fed abundant live entA– or entF– mutant bacteria continued to grow at slower rates (Figure 1I), which confirmed the significant benefit of Ent to host development that was prominently detected by our sensitive assay system (Figures 1B–1D). Such a benefit of Ent on animal growth may also be pronounced in certain natural environments. Since Ent has a high affinity for Fe3+ (Hider and Kong, 2010Hider R.C. Kong X. Chemistry and biology of siderophores.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2010; 27: 637-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, Wilson et al., 2016Wilson B.R. Bogdan A.R. Miyazawa M. Hashimoto K. Tsuji Y.

We employed the commonly used fluorescent cell-permeable dye, calcein-AM, of which emission is quenched by iron binding (Devireddy et al., 2005Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R.

Hare D.J. de Jonge M.D. Birchall I.E. Jenkins N.L. Cherny R.A. Bush A.I. McColl G. Direct in vivo imaging of ferrous iron dyshomeostasis in ageing Caenorhabditis elegans.Chem. Sci. (Camb.). 2015; 6: 2952-2962Crossref Google Scholar) to estimate the overall iron level in the host. Worms fed entA– or entF– mutant bacteria had much lower iron levels, as evidenced by drastically increased fluorescence intensity, and the iron levels were recovered by Ent supplementation (Figure 2A). We also examined the expression of the iron responsive gene ftn-2 that encodes a C. elegans homolog of the iron-storage protein ferritin (Romney et al., 2011Romney S.J. Newman B.S. Thacker C. Leibold E.A. HIF-1 regulates iron homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans by activation and inhibition of genes involved in iron uptake and storage.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002394Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The expression of a pftn-2::GFP reporter was dramatically reduced in worms fed entA– or entF– mutant bacteria (Figure 2B). Therefore, bacterial Ent boosts the iron level in the host C. elegans. To exclude an effect of worm growth status on the Ent-promoted iron level increase, we showed, using both iron markers, that worms fed heat-killed E. coli displayed a lower iron level and such a defect was suppressed by Ent supplementation (Figures 2C and 2D), while the worms remained arrested under both conditions. Conversely, the iron level was low in worms fed abundant live entA– or entF– mutant bacteria alone (Figure 2E), where worms continued to grow, albeit at a lower rate (Figure 1H). Therefore, the Ent impact on the host iron level is independent of other feeding conditions and worm growth. The results from feeding only heat-killed food (Figures 2C and 2D) provided additional evidence that the beneficial Ent effect is not due to a secondary effect of bacterial usage of Ent. The typical worm growth media (NGM agar) seeded with E. coli as food appears to present a low iron environment based on the recipe (Stiernagle, 2006Stiernagle T. Maintenance of C. elegans.WormBook. 2006; 11: 1-11Google Scholar) as well as the fact that Ent biosynthesis in bacteria would be repressed under iron replete conditions (Kwon et al., 1996Kwon O. Hudspeth M.E. Meganathan R. Anaerobic biosynthesis of enterobactin Escherichia coli: Regulation of entC gene expression and evidence against its involvement in menaquinone (vitamin K2) biosynthesis.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3252-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Adding more Fe3+ (FeCl3) to food neither suppressed the growth defect (Figure S2A) nor raised cellular iron level (Figure S2B) in animals fed Ent-deficient food. Addition of hemin also did not impact animal growth (Figure S2C). Therefore, Ent may promote optimal iron uptake and growth of C. elegans regardless of the iron level in food. If Ent is required for optimal C. elegans development, adding more ferric chloride to wild-type E. coli in our assay system (Figure 2F) would be expected to inhibit Ent production in the live E. coli source and consequently slow down worm growth. Indeed, we observed the worm growth defect with the addition of ferric chloride to live E. coli, and this growth defect was suppressed by Ent supplementation (Figures 2F and S2D). This supports a requirement for Ent even in iron-rich environment, which may in turn suggest that iron level in the gut of C. elegans does not usually reach the height leading to a full repression of Ent production from the gut microbiota. Moreover, a previous study showed that, under an iron-poor condition where worms were treated with CaEDTA, the iron level and growth rate were decreased in worms (Klang et al., 2014Klang I.M. Schilling B. Sorensen D.J. Sahu A.K. Kapahi P. Andersen J.K. Swoboda P. Killilea D.W. Gibson B.W. Lithgow G.J. Iron promotes protein insolubility and aging in C. elegans.Aging (Albany N.Y.). 2014; 6: 975-991PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 2G). However, both defects were suppressed by either adding more FeCl3 or Ent supplementation (Figure 2G). Strikingly, 10× FeCl3 supplementation recovered the iron level in worms fed CaEDTA to the level observed in worms fed CaEDTA plus additional Ent (Figure 2G), which indirectly suggests that Ent-mediated iron uptake may be responsible for at least a 10-fold iron level increase in worms under this condition. This result indicates the profound impact of Ent on host iron homeostasis under iron-poor conditions. To understand the mechanism underlying the Ent effect on worm iron homeostasis, we employed affinity chromatography using an immobilized Ent (Zheng et al., 2012Zheng T. Bullock J.L. Nolan E.M. Siderophore-mediated cargo delivery to the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Syntheses of monofunctionalized enterobactin scaffolds and evaluation of enterobactin-cargo conjugate uptake.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012; 134: 18388-18400Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis to identify Ent-binding proteins in worms (Figure 3A). Only two candidate proteins, CTL-2 and ATP-1, were captured in both of two independent experiments (Figures 3A and Table S1). CTL-2 is a homolog of catalases that are known to bind iron (Chelikani et al., 2004Chelikani P. Fita I. Loewen P.C. Diversity of structures and properties among catalases.Cell. Mol.

A body of recent work has shown that childhood SES is positively related to EF, but it is not known whether this disparity grows, diminishes or holds steady over development, from childhood through adulthood. We examined the association between childhood SES and EF in a sample ranging from 9–25 years of age, with six canonical EF tasks. Analyzing all of the tasks together and in functionally defined groups, we found positive relations between SES and EF, and the relations did not vary by age. Analyzing the tasks separately, SES was positively associated with performance in some but not all EF measures, depending on the covariates used, again without varying by age. These results add to a growing body of evidence that childhood SES is associated with EF abilities, and contribute novel evidence concerning the persistence of this association into early adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2888415936,"CKIα ablation induces p53 activation, and CKIα degradation underlies the therapeutic effect of lenalidomide in a pre-leukemia syndrome. Here we describe the development of CKIα inhibitors, which co-target the transcriptional kinases CDK7 and CDK9, thereby augmenting CKIα-induced p53 activation and its anti-leukemic activity. Oncogene-driving super-enhancers (SEs) are highly sensitive to CDK7/9 inhibition. We identified multiple newly gained SEs in primary mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and demonstrate that the inhibitors abolish many SEs and preferentially suppress the transcription elongation of SE-driven oncogenes. We show that blocking CKIα together with CDK7 and/or CDK9 synergistically stabilize p53, deprive leukemia cells of survival and proliferation-maintaining SE-driven oncogenes, and induce apoptosis. Leukemia progenitors are selectively eliminated by the inhibitors, explaining their therapeutic efficacy with preserved hematopoiesis and leukemia cure potential; they eradicate leukemia in MLL-AF9 and Tet2-/-;Flt3ITD AML mouse models and in several patient-derived AML xenograft models, supporting their potential efficacy in curing human leukemia."

However, the method of delivering guide RNA (gRNA) remains a bottleneck in performing CRISPR mutagenesis in Aspergillus species. Here we report a gRNA transcription driven by endogenous tRNA promoters which include a tRNA gene plus 100 base pairs of upstream sequence. Co-transformation of a cas9-expressing plasmid with a linear DNA coding for gRNA demonstrated that 36 of the 37 tRNA promoters tested were able to generate the intended mutation in A. niger. When gRNA and cas9 were expressed in a single extra-chromosomal plasmid, the efficiency of gene mutation was as high as 97%. Co-transformation with DNA template for homologous recombination, the CRISPR/Cas9 system resulted ~42% efficiency of gene replacement in a strain with a functioning non-homologous end joining machinery (kusA+), and an efficiency of >90% gene replacement in a kusA- background. Our results demonstrate that tRNA promoter-mediated gRNA expressions are reliable and efficient in genome editing in A. niger."

https://openalex.org/W2888467384,"Nonenzymatic glycation of collagen has long been associated with the progressive secondary complications of diabetes. How exactly such random glycations result in impaired tissues is still poorly understood. Because of the slow turnover rate of most fibrillar collagens, they are more susceptible to accumulate time-dependent glycations and subsequent advanced glycation end-products. The latter are believed to include cross-links that stiffen host tissues. However, diabetic animal models have also displayed weakened tendons with reduced stiffness. Strikingly, not a single experimentally identified specific molecular site of glycation in a collagen has been reported. Here, using targeted MS, we have identified partial fructosyl-hydroxylysine glycations at each of the helical domain cross-linking sites of type I collagen that are elevated in tissues from a diabetic mouse model. Glycation was not found at any other collagen lysine residues. Type I collagen in mouse tendons is cross-linked intermolecularly by acid-labile aldimine bonds formed by the addition of telopeptide lysine aldehydes to hydroxylysine residues at positions α1(I)Lys87, α1(I)Lys930, α2(I)Lys87, and α2(I)Lys933 of the triple helix. Our data reveal that site-specific glycations of these specific lysines may significantly impair normal lysyl oxidase–controlled cross-linking in diabetic tendons. We propose that such N-linked glycations can hinder the normal cross-linking process, thus altering the content and/or placement of mature cross-links with the potential to modify tissue material properties."
https://openalex.org/W2888235185,"In 2015, there was a large outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil. Despite its relatively mild impact on healthy adults, ZIKV infection during pregnancy has been associated with severe birth defects. Currently, there is no ZIKV vaccine available, but several vaccine candidates based on the ZIKV membrane (M) and envelope (Env) structural proteins showed promising results in preclinical and clinical studies. Here, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a non-replicating adenoviral vector type 26 (Ad26) that encodes the ZIKV M-Env antigens (Ad26.ZIKV.M-Env) was evaluated in mice and non-human primates (NHP). Ad26.ZIKV.M-Env induced strong and durable cellular and humoral immune responses in preclinical models. Humoral responses were characterized by Env-binding and ZIKV neutralizing antibody responses while cellular responses were characterized by ZIKV reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Importantly, a single immunization with a very low dose of 4x107 vp of Ad26.ZIKV.M-Env protected mice from ZIKV challenge. In NHP, a single immunization with a typical human dose of 1x1011 vp of Ad26.ZIKV.M-Env also induced Env-binding and ZIKV neutralizing antibodies and Env and M specific cellular immune responses that associated with complete protection against viremia from ZIKV challenge as measured in plasma and other body fluids. Together these data provide the rationale to progress the Ad26.ZIKV.M-Env candidate vaccine to clinical testing."
https://openalex.org/W2888635442,"Background Urine poses an attractive non-invasive means for obtaining liquid biopsies for oncological diagnostics. Especially molecular analysis on urinary DNA is a rapid growing field. However, optimal and practical storage conditions that result in preservation of urinary DNA, and in particular hypermethylated DNA (hmDNA), are yet to be determined. Aim To determine the most optimal and practical conditions for urine storage that result in adequate preservation of DNA for hmDNA analysis. Methods DNA yield for use in methylation analysis was determined by quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) targeting the ACTB and RASSF1A genes on bisulfite modified DNA. First, DNA yield (ACTB qMSP) was determined in a pilot study on urine samples of healthy volunteers using two preservatives (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and Urine Conditioning Buffer, Zymo Research) at four different temperatures (room temperature (RT), 4°C, -20°C, -80°C) for four time periods (1, 2, 7, 28 days). Next, hmDNA levels (RASSF1A qMSP) in stored urine samples of patients suffering from bladder cancer (n = 10) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n = 10) were measured at day 0 and 7 upon storage with and without the addition of 40mM EDTA and/or 20 μl/ml Penicillin Streptomycin (PenStrep) at RT and 4°C. Results In the pilot study, DNA for methylation analysis was only maintained at RT upon addition of preserving agents. In urine stored at 4°C for a period of 7 days or more, the addition of either preserving agent yielded a slightly better preservation of DNA. When urine was stored at -20 °C or -80 °C for up to 28 days, DNA was retained irrespective of the addition of preserving agents. In bladder cancer and NSCLC samples stored at RT loss of DNA was significantly less if EDTA was added compared to no preserving agents (p<0.001). Addition of PenStrep did not affect DNA preservation (p>0.99). Upon storage at 4°C, no difference in DNA preservation was found after the addition of preserving agents (p = 0.18). The preservation of methylated DNA (RASSF1A) was strongly correlated to that of unmethylated DNA (ACTB) in most cases, except when PCR values became inaccurate. Conclusions Addition of EDTA offers an inexpensive preserving agent for urine storage at RT up to seven days allowing for reliable hmDNA analysis. To avoid bacterial overgrowth PenStrep can be added without negatively affecting DNA preservation."
https://openalex.org/W2888766754,"Objective The mechanism of liver injury with low-dose methotrexate (MTX) is incompletely understood. This study was designed to evaluate the association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver injury during MTX treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Between October 2014 and May 2015, we enrolled all MTX users for RA and monitored participant serum hepatic transaminase levels for 1 year. All patients had normal transaminase levels before the first MTX prescription. Using diagnostic criteria for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), we performed histological analyses for patients presenting persistent transaminitis, defined as elevations of hepatic transaminases in four of six determinations during the follow-up period. Possible risk factors for persistent transaminitis were also examined. Results We followed 846 RA patients with a mean cumulative MTX dose of 2.48 g and identified 51 patients presenting persistent transaminitis. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, obesity (odds ratio [OR] 3.23, p < 0.001), type 2 diabetes (OR 3.52, p = 0.001), hypercholesterolemia (OR 2.56, p = 0.004), and hyperuricemia (OR 3.52, p = 0.019), which are recognized as risk factors for NAFLD, were independently associated with a risk of persistent transaminitis. Among patients with persistent transaminitis, 42 showed fatty liver at ultrasonography. These patients had no evidence of alcoholic fatty liver, chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver diseases, or hereditary liver diseases. Biopsy specimens were obtained from 32 patients, and we found that a NASH-like pattern was the most prevalent histological abnormality. There was no significant impact of MTX dose and duration on the histological severity. Conclusion Risk factors and histological findings are similar between NAFLD/NASH and liver injury during low-dose MTX treatment for RA, which suggests a strong association between both entities. NAFLD/NASH may be an underlying condition causing persistent transaminitis in MTX-treated RA patients. The results of this study illustrate the need for monitoring liver injury in RA patients with NAFLD risk factors during MTX treatment."

However, the risk of psoriasis in patients with hypertension is not clear. Therefore, we investigated the risk of psoriasis in patients with hypertension. A total of 256,356 adults (42,726 in the hypertension group and 213,630 in the control group) were followed from 2003 to 2013 in a nationwide population-based cohort study. During the follow-up, 9,254 participants (3.6%) were found to have psoriasis (2,152 [5.0%] in the hypertension group and 7,102 [3.3%] in the control group). The hypertension group had a higher risk of psoriasis incidence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.47–1.61, P < 0.001), and the association remained significant after adjusting for comorbidities of diabetes and dyslipidemia, antihypertensive medication and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and sociodemographic factors (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08–1.28, P < 0.001). In conclusion, hypertension was significantly associated with an increased risk of psoriasis incidence. Further studies are needed to confirm whether hypertension is associated with the incidence of psoriasis."

Given the ongoing criminalization of HIV non-disclosure and prevalence of gender-based violence, there is a critical need to better understand the dynamics of negotiating sexual relationships and HIV disclosure among WLWH. We conducted 64 qualitative interviews with cis and trans WLWH in Vancouver, Canada between 2015 and 2017. The interviews were conducted by three experienced researchers, including a cis and a trans WLWH using a semi-structured interview guide. Drawing on a feminist analytical framework and concepts of structural violence, the analysis sought to characterize the negotiation of sexual relationships and HIV disclosure among WLWH in a criminalized setting. For many participants their HIV diagnosis initially symbolized the end of their sexuality due to fear of rejection and potential legal consequences. WLWH recounted that disclosing their HIV status shifted the power dynamics in sexual relationships and many feared rejection, violence, and being outed as living with HIV. Participants’ narratives also highlighted that male condom refusal was common and WLWH were not only subjected to the gendered interpersonal violence of male condom refusal but also to the structural violence of legislation that requires condom use but fails to account for the gendered power imbalance that shapes condom negotiation. Despite frequently being represented as a law that ‘protects’ women, our findings indicate that the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure constitutes a form of gendered structural violence that exacerbates risk for interpersonal violence among WLWH. In line with recommendations by, the WHO and UNAIDS these findings demonstrate the negative impacts of regulating HIV prevention through the use of criminal law for WLWH."
https://openalex.org/W2888260178,"Synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins are required for synaptogenesis. The molecular mechanisms for coordinated synthesis of these proteins are not understood. Using forward genetic screens, we identified the conserved THO nuclear export complex (THOC) as an important regulator of presynapse development in C. elegans dopaminergic neurons. In THOC mutants, synaptic messenger RNAs are retained in the nucleus, resulting in dramatic decrease of synaptic protein expression, near complete loss of synapses, and compromised dopamine function. CRE binding protein (CREB) interacts with THOC to mark synaptic transcripts for efficient nuclear export. Deletion of Thoc5, a THOC subunit, in mouse dopaminergic neurons causes severe defects in synapse maintenance and subsequent neuronal death in the substantia nigra compacta. These cellular defects lead to abrogated dopamine release, ataxia, and animal death. Together, our results argue that nuclear export mechanisms can select specific mRNAs and be a rate-limiting step for neuronal differentiation and survival."

In co-cultivation assays, the five FLA species were either bacteriostatic or bactericidal to X. oryzae pv. oryzae and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. Despite these effects, bacteria were rarely detected inside amoebal cells. Furthermore, amoebae did not disrupt X. oryzae biofilms. The bactericidal effects persisted when bacteria were added to a cell-free supernatant from amoebal cultures, suggesting some amoebae produce an extracellular bactericidal compound.This work establishes novel, basal dynamics between important plant pathogenic bacteria and diverse amoebae, and lays the framework for future mechanistic studies."

However, it is unclear whether the HookA–dynein–dynactin interaction requires p27, another pointed-end protein forming heterodimers with p25 within vertebrate dynactin. Here, live-cell imaging and biochemical pulldown experiments revealed that although p27 is a component of the dynactin complex in A. nidulans, it is dispensable for dynein–dynactin to interact with ΔC-HookA (cytosolic HookA lacking its early endosome–binding C terminus) and is not critical for dynein-mediated early endosome transport. Using mutagenesis, imaging, and biochemical approaches, we found that several p25 regions are required for the ΔC-HookA–dynein–dynactin interaction, with the N terminus and loop1 being the most critical regions. Interestingly, p25 was also important for the microtubule (MT) plus-end accumulation of dynactin. This p25 function in dynactin localization also involved p25's N terminus and the loop1 critical for the ΔC-HookA–dynein–dynactin interaction. Given that dynactin's MT plus-end localization does not require HookA and that the kinesin-1–dependent plus-end accumulation of dynactin is unnecessary for the ΔC-HookA–dynein–dynactin interaction, our results indicate that p25 plays a dual role in cargo binding and dynactin regulation. As cargo adapters are implicated in dynein activation via binding to dynactin's pointed end to switch the conformation of p150, a major dynactin component, our results suggest p25 as a critical pointed-end protein involved in this process.

In the EM structure of the BICD2–dynein–dynactin supercomplex, BICD2 directly contacts the Arp1 filament as well as its pointed end where p150's CC1A (the first part of CC1) domain also seems to contact when p150 is in its folded or “locked” conformation (3Cianfrocco M.A. DeSantis M.E.

These observations led to an interesting hypothesis that cargo adapters may compete with p150's CC1A domain for binding to the pointed end, thereby causing p150 to assume its open or “unlocked” conformation, which in turn activates dynein (3Cianfrocco M.A. DeSantis M.E.

However, the identity of pointed-end proteins involved in this process remains unknown. Although p25 is involved in the HookA–dynein–dynactin interaction, we have never tested the role of p27, the binding partner of p25, in this interaction. Because p25 and p27 are required for the stability of each other in mammalian cells (18Yeh T.Y. Quintyne N.J. Scipioni B.R. Eckley D.M. Schroer T.A. Dynactin's pointed-end complex is a cargo-targeting module.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23 (22918948): 3827-383710.1091/mbc.e12-07-0496Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it has not been clear whether p27 mediates the function of p25. In this work, we obtained evidence that p27 in A. nidulans is not critical for the HookA–dynein–dynactin interaction. Thus, within the p25–p27 heterodimer, only p25 is critical for the HookA–dynactin–dynein interaction. We identified several regions of p25 important for this interaction, including the two most critical regions, the N terminus and loop1. Importantly, we found that loss of p25 significantly decreases the MT plus-end accumulation of dynactin in live cells, and the two regions of p25 critical for HookA binding, namely the N terminus and the loop1 region, are also critical for dynactin's MT plus-end accumulation. In conjunction with published structural data (12Urnavicius L. Zhang K. Diamant A.G. Motz C. Schlager M.A. Yu M. Patel N.A. Robinson C.V. Carter A.P.

Although p25 is known to be critical for early endosome transport (17Zhang J. Yao X. Fischer L. Abenza J.F. Peñalva M.A. Xiang X.

A previous sequence analysis indicates that both p25 and p27 adopt the left-handed parallel β-helix (LβH) fold (31Parisi G. Fornasari M.S. Echave J.

Although the Δp25 mutant defective in dynein-mediated early endosome transport exhibits a dramatic accumulation of early endosome in 100% of the hyphal tips, only about 38% of the Δp27 hyphal tips (n = 203) showed a very mild accumulation of early endosomes (Fig. 1B). Representative kymographs show that whereas early endosomes are mostly nonmobile and accumulated at the hyphal tip region in the Δp25 mutant, they move bi-directionally in the Δp27 mutant and WT cells (Fig. 1C). The overall frequency of dynein-mediated transport of early endosomes away from the hyphal tip is significantly decreased in the Δp25 mutant but not in the Δp27 mutant (Fig. 1D).

The practices of such sectors have seldom been described and analyzed to better understand their implication in the introduction and spread of infectious pig diseases. Moreover, the Georgian pig sector was badly hit by an epidemic of African swine fever in 2007 that quickly spread throughout the region. Materials and methods We interviewed 487 pig farmers and 116 butchers using closed questionnaires on socioeconomic issues related to pig production, husbandry practices, biosecurity, marketing and movements, and disease awareness. Surveys were conducted in four regions of Georgia and descriptive statistics were computed. Factorial analyses of mixed data and hierarchical clustering on principal components were applied to study the relationship among collected variables for both farmers and butchers. Results Results show that pig farming in Georgia is a non-professional sector, highly heterogeneous by region, characterized by smallholdings of few animals, with low inputs, outdated technologies, and poor biosecurity, which all translates into low outputs and productivity. The hierarchical clustering on principal components confirmed that there are five major production and husbandry strategies, which match the four regions where the study was conducted. Conclusions Our results are the first step to quantify biosecurity gaps and risky behaviours, develop risk profiles, and identify critical control points across the market chain where to implement mitigation measures. This study provides the baseline information needed to design realistic and sustainable prevention, surveillance and control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2889543660,"In the last decade, intramembrane proteases have gained increasing attention because of their many links to various diseases. Nevertheless, our understanding as to how they function or how they are regulated is still limited, especially when it comes to human homologues. In this regard, here we sought to unravel mechanisms of regulation of the protease rhomboid-like protein-4 (RHBDL4), one of five active human serine intramembrane proteases. In view of our recent finding that human RHBDL4 efficiently cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key protein in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, we used established reagents to modulate the cellular cholesterol content and analyzed the effects of this modulation on RHBDL4-mediated processing of endogenous APP. We discovered that lowering membrane cholesterol levels increased the levels of RHBDL4-specific endogenous APP fragments, whereas high cholesterol levels had the opposite effect. Direct binding of cholesterol to APP did not mediate these modulating effects of cholesterol. Instead, using homology modeling, we identified two potential cholesterol-binding motifs in the transmembrane helices 3 and 6 of RHBDL4. Substitution of the essential tyrosine residues of the potential cholesterol-binding motifs to alanine increased the levels of endogenous APP C-terminal fragments, reflecting enhanced RHBDL4 activity. In summary, we provide evidence that the activity of RHBDL4 is regulated by cholesterol likely through a direct binding of cholesterol to the enzyme.

In view of our recent finding that human RHBDL4 efficiently cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key protein in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, we used established reagents to modulate the cellular cholesterol content and analyzed the effects of this modulation on RHBDL4-mediated processing of endogenous APP. We discovered that lowering membrane cholesterol levels increased the levels of RHBDL4-specific endogenous APP fragments, whereas high cholesterol levels had the opposite effect. Direct binding of cholesterol to APP did not mediate these modulating effects of cholesterol. Instead, using homology modeling, we identified two potential cholesterol-binding motifs in the transmembrane helices 3 and 6 of RHBDL4. Substitution of the essential tyrosine residues of the potential cholesterol-binding motifs to alanine increased the levels of endogenous APP C-terminal fragments, reflecting enhanced RHBDL4 activity. In summary, we provide evidence that the activity of RHBDL4 is regulated by cholesterol likely through a direct binding of cholesterol to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2888010562,"Background Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is associated with remodelling of the extracellular matrix and invasion in various cancers. Identifying proteins connected to high MMP-9 expression is important in explaining its mechanisms. Our study aims to shed light on genes associated with high MMP-9 expression and to discuss their clinical impact in breast cancer. Methods We evaluated 173 breast cancer cases from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, with 1964 cases from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium database serving as a validation cohort. We investigated relationships between MMP-9 expression and clinicopathological characteristics. We then used gene set enrichment analyses to detect the association of genes with MMP-9 overexpression, and performed survival analyses to determine the significance of the gene in three independent cohorts. Results High MMP-9 expression correlated with poor prognosis in univariate and multivariate analyses. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we found that tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 12A (TNFRSF12A) was linked to high MMP-9 expression. In the survival analysis of three published data sets (METABRIC, GSE1456, GSE20685), high TNFRSF12A was relevant to a poor survival rate. Conclusions High levels of TNFRSF12A associated with MMP-9 overexpression may be important to explain the progression of breast cancer, and survival could be improved using therapy targeting TNFRSF12A."
https://openalex.org/W2888445175,"In Kenya, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for 27% of all deaths. Adult Kenyans have an 18% chance of dying prematurely from cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or chronic respiratory diseases. A Novartis Access Initiative is making medicines available to treat cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and breast cancer in 30 countries, including Kenya. Little is known about patients’ perceptions of access to medicines for NCDs in Kenya. The study objective was to understand patients’ perceptions of access to medicines; as well as barriers and facilitators at the household, community, and healthcare system level. A baseline qualitative study was conducted in eight of 47 counties as part of an evaluation of the Novartis Access Initiative in Kenya. The 84 patients interviewed through a household survey had been diagnosed and treated for an NCD. Although medicines at government facilities were free or cheaper than those sold in private pharmacies, the availability of medicines presented a constant challenge. Patients often resorted to private pharmacies, where NCD medicines cost more than at public facilities. Participants with an NCD took their health seriously and strove to get the medicines, even under difficult circumstances. Buying NCD medicines put a strain on the household budget, especially for the lower-income participants. Some actions to overcome affordability barriers included: borrowing money, selling assets, seeking help from relatives, taking on extra work, buying partial dosages, leaving without the medicines, or resorting to non-medical alternatives. In conclusion, access to NCD medicines is a major challenge for most adults in Kenya. As a result, they engage in complex interactions between public, private facilities and pharmacies to overcome the barriers. The government should ensure well-stocked public sector pharmacies and subsidize prices of medicines for lower-income patients. Integration of industry-led access to medicine programs may help governments to obtain low cost supplies."
https://openalex.org/W2888497110,"An early manifestation of coronary artery disease in advanced age is the development of microvascular dysfunction leading to deficits in diastolic function. Our lab has previously shown that epicardial treatment with adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) preserves microvascular function following coronary ischemia in a young rodent model. Follow-up studies showed intravenous (i.v.) delivery of SVF allows the cells to migrate to the walls of small vessels and reset vasomotor tone. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that the i.v. cell injection of SVF would reverse the coronary microvascular dysfunction associated with aging in a rodent model. Fischer 344 rats were divided into 4 groups: young control (YC), old control (OC), old + rat aortic endothelial cells (O+EC) and old + GFP+ SVF cells (O+SVF). After four weeks, cardiac function and coronary flow reserve (CFR) were measured via echocardiography, and hearts were explanted either for histology or isolation of coronary arterioles for vessel reactivity studies. In a subgroup of animals, microspheres were injected during resting and dobutamine-stimulated conditions to measure coronary blood flow. GFP+ SVF cells engrafted and persisted in the myocardium and coronary vasculature four weeks following i.v. injection. Echocardiography showed age-related diastolic dysfunction without accompanying systolic dysfunction; diastolic function was improved in old rats after SVF treatment. Ultrasound and microsphere data both showed increased stimulated coronary blood flow in O+SVF rats compared to OC and O+EC, while isolated vessel reactivity was mostly unchanged. I.v.-injected SVF cells were capable of incorporating into the vasculature of the aging heart and are shown in this study to improve CFR and diastolic function in a model of advanced age. Importantly, SVF injection did not lead to arrhythmias or increased mortality in aged rats. SVF cells provide an autologous cell therapy option for treatment of microvascular and cardiac dysfunction in aged populations."
https://openalex.org/W2888545709,"Aim Little is known about whether and how local-level resources regarding home care are associated with the prevalence of home deaths. We aimed to investigate whether geographic patterns of the resources for home care were associated with the prevalence of home deaths, taking spatial variation into consideration. Methods We conducted an ecological cross-sectional study in Japan using nationwide data in 2014. The areal unit was the municipality, the smallest administrative unit in Japan. We investigated the association between the percentage of home deaths and the resources of home care support clinics with available 24-hour-a-day functions, considering the geographic effect of neighboring municipalities by applying a geographically weighted regression model. Results The mean and standard deviation of the percentages of home deaths were 11.4% (5.0%), and those of the number of home care support clinics per 10,000 elderly population were 3.4 (3.7). The percentages of home deaths in neighboring municipalities tended to be significantly correlated (Moran’s I 0.34, p<0.001). Adjusting for the number of hospital beds, total population, and the socio-economic status of municipality, the results of an ordinary least squares regression model showed a positive correlation between the percentage of home deaths and the local resources for home care support clinics per 10,000 elderly population (regression coefficient 0.15, 95% confidence interval 0.07, 0.22), while the existence of spatial autocorrelation of the residual was suggested (Moran’s I of the residual 0.227, p<0.001). The geographically weighted regression model showed local regression coefficients varying across municipalities with a better model fit over the analogous ordinary least squares model (adjusted R2 0.414 vs. 0.131). Conclusion Home deaths were more prevalent in municipalities with greater home care resources. This association was geographically varied and further strengthened in some areas."
https://openalex.org/W2888078923,"Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are exploratory methods that can be applied to construct networks of food intake. Such networks were constructed for meal-structured data, elucidating how foods are consumed in relation to each other at meal level. Meal-specific networks were compared with habitual dietary networks using data from an EPIC-Potsdam sub-cohort study. Three 24-hour dietary recalls were collected cross-sectionally from 815 adults in 2010-2012. Food intake was averaged to obtain the habitual intake. GGMs were applied to four main meals and habitual intakes of 39 food groups to generate meal-specific and habitual dietary networks, respectively. Communities and centrality were detected in the dietary networks to facilitate interpretation. The breakfast network revealed five communities of food groups with other vegetables, sauces, bread, margarine, and sugar & confectionery as central food groups. The lunch and afternoon snacks networks showed higher variability in food consumption and six communities were detected in each of these meal networks. Among the central food groups detected in both of these meal networks were potatoes, red meat, other vegetables, and bread. Two dinner networks were identified with five communities and other vegetables as a central food group. Partial correlations at meals were stronger than on the habitual level. The meal-specific dietary networks were only partly reflected in the habitual dietary network with a decreasing percentage: 64.3% for dinner, 50.0% for breakfast, 36.2% for lunch, and 33.3% for afternoon snack. The method of GGM yielded dietary networks that describe combinations of foods at the respective meals. Analysing food consumption on the habitual level did not exactly reflect meal level intake. Therefore, interpretation of habitual networks should be done carefully. Meal networks can help understand dietary habits, however, GGMs warrant validation in other populations."
https://openalex.org/W2888141046,"Drought and vegetation conditions within the Damqu River Basin, part of the Yangtze River Source Region (YRSR), are assessed here using the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the leaf area index (LAI). We utilized Sen's method, least squares regression method, linear regression and Pearson's correlation analysis to study variations in drought and vegetation indices and the drought effect on vegetation between 1988 and 2015. Results reveal that droughts occurred at a 25% frequency over this period; SPI and SPEI analyses show that 1994, 1999, 2005, and 2010 were change points and that the basin was characterized by varying drought and humidity trends. Subsequent to 2010, both SPI and SPEI decreased within the basin, while 1995, 2000, 2004, and 2010 were change points for NDVI and LAI while the watershed exhibited variable trends in vegetation reduction and increase. The NDVI-annual values of 63.36% regions and the LAI-summer values of 68.39% areas within the basin were decreased during 1988-2015 and 2000-2015, respectively. Subsequent to 2010, both NDVI and LAI decreased within the basin and significant positive correlations at inter-annual and inter-summer time scales were seen in both drought and vegetation indices; drought has exerted a lag effect on vegetation as shown by significant positive correlations between annual SPI/SPEI values and following year NDVI/LAI values."
https://openalex.org/W2888308391,"PolyQ-expanded huntingtin (mHtt) variants form aggregates, termed inclusion bodies (IBs), in individuals with and models of Huntington's disease (HD). The role of IB versus diffusible mHtt in neurotoxicity remains unclear. Using a ponasterone (PA)-inducible cell model of HD, here we evaluated the effects of heat shock on the appearance and functional outcome of Htt103QExon1-EGFP expression. Quantitative image analysis indicated that 80-90% of this mHtt protein initially appears as signals in the cytosol, with IBs forming at high mHtt expression. A 2-h heat shock during the PA induction reduced the diffuse signal, but greatly increased mHtt IB formation in both cytosol and nucleus. Dose- and time-dependent mHtt expression suggested that nucleated polymerization drives IB formation. RNA-mediated knockdown of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and heat shock cognate 70 protein (HSC70) provided evidence for their involvement in promoting diffuse mHtt to form IBs. Reporter gene assays assessing the impacts of diffuse versus IB mHtt showed concordance of diffuse mHtt expression with the repression of heat shock factor 1, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), and NF-κB activity. CREB repression was reversed by heat shock coinciding with mHtt IB formation. In an embryonic striatal neuron-derived HD model, the chemical chaperone sorbitol similarly promoted the structuring of diffuse mHtt into IBs and supported cell survival under stress. Our results provide evidence that mHtt IB formation is a chaperone-supported cellular coping mechanism that depletes diffusible mHtt conformers, alleviates transcription factor dysfunction, and promotes neuron survival."
https://openalex.org/W2888250792,"The number of discovered natural miRNA sponges in plants, viruses, and mammals is increasing steadily. Some sponges like ciRS-7 for miR-7 contain multiple nearby miRNA binding sites. We hypothesize that such clusters of miRNA binding sites on the genome can function together as a sponge. No systematic effort has been made in search for clusters of miRNA targets. Here, we, to our knowledge, make the first genome-wide target site predictions for clusters of mature human miRNAs. For each miRNA, we predict the target sites on a genome-wide scale, build a graph with edge weights based on the pairwise distances between sites, and apply Markov clustering to identify genomic regions with high binding site density. Significant clusters are then extracted based on cluster size difference between real and shuffled genomes preserving local properties such as the GC content. We then use conservation and binding energy to filter a final set of miRNA target site clusters or sponge candidates. Our pipeline predicts 3673 sponge candidates for 1250 miRNAs, including the experimentally verified miR-7 sponge ciRS-7. In addition, we point explicitly to 19 high-confidence candidates overlapping annotated genomic sequence. The full list of candidates is freely available at http://rth.dk/resources/mirnasponge, where detailed properties for individual candidates can be explored, such as alignment details, conservation, accessibility and target profiles, which facilitates selection of sponge candidates for further context specific analysis."

To identify the optimal long-term seed storage conditions for these species, we evaluated the viability of seeds with different seed water contents (SWCs) at various storage temperatures and time periods. P. davidiana seeds with <6% SWC could be stored at room temperature (RT) for 4 weeks, while P. koreana seeds showed no storability at RT. P. davidiana seeds with 3% SWC showed 74% viability after 36 months of storage at 4°C, while those with 9–18% SWC showed >89% viability after 48 months of storage at -18°C. Long-term storage at -80°C was best for P. davidiana seeds with a wide range of SWCs (3–24%), with 91–98% of normal germination after 48 months of storage. However, the normal germination of P. koreana seeds with 3–24% SWC declined to <20% after 36 months of storage, even at -18°C and -80°C. No significant difference was observed between seeds immersed vs. not immersed in liquid nitrogen for both species. Our findings increase the possibility for long-term seed conservation for both Populus species."

https://openalex.org/W2888064284,"The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a negative regulator of mTOR complex 1, a signaling node promoting cellular growth in response to various nutrients and growth factors. However, several regulators in TSC signaling still await discovery and characterization. Using pulldown and MS approaches, here we identified the TSC complex member, TBC1 domain family member 7 (TBC1D7), as a binding partner for PH domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1), a negative regulator of Akt kinase signaling. Most TBC domain–containing proteins function as Rab GTPase–activating proteins (RabGAPs), but the crystal structure of TBC1D7 revealed that it lacks residues critical for RabGAP activity. Sequence analysis identified a putative site for both Akt-mediated phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding at Ser-124, and we found that Akt phosphorylates TBC1D7 at Ser-124. However, this phosphorylation had no effect on the binding of TBC1D7 to TSC1, but stabilized TBC1D7. Moreover, 14-3-3 protein both bound and stabilized TBC1D7 in a growth factor–dependent manner, and a phospho-deficient substitution, S124A, prevented this interaction. The crystal structure of 14-3-3ζ in complex with a phospho-Ser-124 TBC1D7 peptide confirmed the direct interaction between 14-3-3 and TBC1D7. The sequence immediately upstream of Ser-124 aligned with a canonical β-TrCP degron, and we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP2 ubiquitinates TBC1D7 and decreases its stability. Our findings reveal that Akt activity determines the phosphorylation status of TBC1D7 at the phospho-switch Ser-124, which governs binding to either 14-3-3 or β-TrCP2, resulting in increased or decreased stability of TBC1D7, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2888545293,"Background Lower vitamin D levels are found in people with schizophrenia and depressive disorders, and also associated with neuroimaging abnormalities such as reduced brain volume in both animals and humans. Reduced whole brain and increased ventricular volume are also systematically reported in schizophrenia. Even though vitamin D deficiency has been proposed as a risk mechanism for schizophrenia there exist no studies to date of the association between vitamin D levels and brain volume in this population. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between vitamin D levels and brain phenotypes in psychotic disorders, and assessed possible interactions with genetic variants in vitamin D receptor (VDR) and other genetic variants that play a role in vitamin D levels in the body. Methods Our sample consisted of 83 psychosis patients and 101 healthy controls. We measured vitamin D levels as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. All participants were genotyped and neuroimaging conducted by structural magnetic resonance imaging. Results Vitamin D levels were significantly positively associated with peripheral grey matter volume in patients (β 860.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 333.4–1466, p < .003). A significant interaction effect of BSML marker (rs1544410) was observed to mediate the association between patient status and both white matter volume (β 23603.3; 95% CI 2732.8–48708.6, p < .05) and whole brain volume (β 46670.6, 95% CI 8817.8–93888.3, p < .04). Vitamin D did not predict ventricular volume, which rather was associated with patient status (β 4423.3, 95% CI 1583.2–7267.8p < .002) and CYP24A1 marker (rs6013897) (β 2491.5, 95% CI 269.7–4978.5, p < .04). Conclusions This is the first study of the association between vitamin D levels and brain volume in patients with psychotic disorders that takes into account possible interaction with genetic polymorphisms. The present findings warrant replication in independent samples."

This work reveals the potential of Wikipedia mining for geopolitical study. Actually, Wikipedia offers solid knowledge and strong correlations among countries by linking web pages together for different types of information (e.g. economical, historical, political, and many others). The major finding of this paper is to show that meaningful results on the influence of country ties can be extracted from the hyperlinked structure of Wikipedia. We leverage a novel stochastic matrix representation of Markov chains of complex directed networks called the reduced Google matrix theory. For a selected small size set of nodes, the reduced Google matrix concentrates direct and indirect links of the million-node sized Wikipedia network into a small Perron-Frobenius matrix keeping the PageRank probabilities of the global Wikipedia network. We perform a novel sensitivity analysis that leverages this reduced Google matrix to characterize the influence of relationships between countries from the global network. We apply this analysis to two chosen sets of countries (i.e. the set of 27 European Union countries and a set of 40 top worldwide countries). We show that with our sensitivity analysis we can exhibit easily very meaningful information on geopolitics from five different Wikipedia editions (English, Arabic, Russian, French and German)."
https://openalex.org/W2888278291,"Previous research points to two major hypotheses regarding the mechanisms by which touch can be experienced as erotogenic. The first concerns the body part to which touch is applied (erogenous zones) and the second the modality of touch (sensual touch optimal in activating C Tactile afferents). In this study, we explored for the first time the relation between those two mechanisms in actual and imagined social touch. In a first experiment, we randomly assigned ""Giver"" and ""Receiver"" roles within 19 romantic couples (20 females, 18 males, age 32.34 ± 8.71SD years) and asked the ""Giver"" to apply CT-optimal (3 cm/s) vs. CT-suboptimal (18 cm/s) touch on an erogenous (neck) vs. non-erogenous zone (forehead) of their partner. We then obtained ratings of pleasantness and sexual arousal from both ""Receivers"" and ""Givers"". In a second experiment, 32 healthy females (age 25.16 ± 5.91SD years) were asked to imagine CT-optimal vs. CT-suboptimal stimulation (stroking vs. patting) and velocity (3 cm/s vs. 18 cm/s) on different erogenous vs. non-erogenous zones and rate pleasantness. While both erogenous body part and CT-optimal, sensual touch were found to increase pleasant and erotic sensations, the results showed a lack of an interaction. Furthermore, pleasantness was induced by mere imagination of touch without any tactile stimulation, and touch that was sexually arousing for the receiver was rated as more sexually arousing for the giver as well, pointing to top-down, learned expectations of sensory pleasure and erogeneity. Taken together, these studies provide the first direct evidence that while both the body location to which touch is applied and the mode of touch contribute to pleasant and erotic sensations, these two factors appear to mediate subjective pleasantness and erogeneity by, at least partly, independent mechanisms."

We sought to determine whether blood pressure variability (BPV) estimated by average real variability (ARV) is one of the predictors of poor outcome at 90 days. Four hundred fifty-one consecutive patients with ischemic stroke treated within 7 days after onset were enrolled prospectively. Baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on all subjects. Blood pressure was measured for all recruited patients every 2 hours in the first 24 hours after admission, followed by measurements collected every 4 hours from day 2 to day 7 after admission. ARV was used to estimate BPV. A total of 192 patients with minor ischemic stroke were enrolled, and 11 of them (5.7%) had poor outcomes. Univariate regression analysis showed that early neurological deterioration (X2 = 21.44, P = 0.000), severe symptomatic large artery stenosis or occlusion (X2 = 9.260, P = 0.000), large artery atherosclerotic stroke (X2 = 7.14, P = 0.002), total cholesterol (TC), and D2-7 SBP-ARV (t = 5.449, P = 0.001) of the poor outcome group were significantly higher than those of the good outcome group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that early neurological deterioration (OR 4.369, 95% CI 3.54, 15.65; P = 0.001), severe symptomatic large artery stenosis or occlusion (OR 5.56, 95% CI 3.56, 13.65; P = 0.000), large artery atherosclerotic stroke (OR 3.56, 95% CI 1.45, 7.48; P = 0.004), and D2-7 SBP-ARV (OR 3.96, 95% CI 1.90, 20.18, P = 0.008) were significantly related to poor outcomes. In conclusion, approximately 5.7% of minor ischemic stroke patients had poor outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W2888642855,"Purpose To analyze changes in corneal topographic measurements and higher-order aberrations (HOAs) after horizontal muscle surgery for exotropia. Design Retrospective, observational study. Methods A total of 131 eyes of 121 patients who had undergone surgery for exotropia were included. The eyes with unilateral lateral rectus (ULR) or bilateral lateral rectus (BLR) recession(s) were assigned to group A, and those with unilateral lateral rectus recession & medial rectus resection (R&R) to group B. Corneal topographic measurements and HOAs were compared between the preoperative and postoperative periods using a Placido-dual Scheimpflug analyzer (Galilei 2TM, Ziemer, Port., Switzerland) for each group. Results In group A, simulated keratometery (sim K) was significantly changed until 3 months postoperatively relative to the preoperative value (postoperative 1 week, p = 0.017; 1 month, p = 0.037; and 3 months, p = 0.023, respectively). All steep K (steep sim K, steep-Kpost, and TCP-steep K) parameters also were significantly changed at postoperative 1 month (p<0.001, p = 0.015, p<0.001, respectively), but not at 3 months. Among the higher-order aberrations, spherical aberration (Z40) and secondary horizontal astigmatism (Z42) at postoperative 1 week had significantly changed from the preoperative values, as had horizontal quadrafoil (Z44) at 1 month. However, in group B, only vertical quadrafoil (Z4-4) showed statistically significant changes, at postoperative 1 and 3 months. None of the other postoperative parameters was significantly different from the corresponding preoperative value. Conclusion Lateral rectus recession induced changes in both corneal topographic measurements and HOAs, whereas R&R did so only in HOAs. These changes might explain some patients' complaints about poor quality of vision."
https://openalex.org/W2888772162,"To assess the effects of exposure to a food-choice task (appetizing versus healthy food) on risky decision-making by excess versus normal weight adolescents. We also analyzed the influence of food visualization on hunger levels, as well as group differences in food choices and impulsivity.Fifty-six adolescents (aged 13-18 years) classified as excess (n = 27) or normal (n = 29) weight participated in the study. Risky-decision-making was assessed through the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, which was administered before and after a food-choice task. We also evaluated impulsivity traits through the UPPS-P Scale, and subjective hunger levels with a visual analogue scale.Adolescents with excess weight showed enhanced risky decision-making after the food-choice task compared to normal weight adolescents, as well as increased hunger levels. Furthermore, excess weight adolescents made more appetizing choices, and showed greater scores for Positive Urgency and Sensation Seeking. Reward-related impulsivity measures were positively associated with the number of appetizing choices in the food-choice task. Several associations were found between impulsivity measures, hunger levels and risk-taking variables.Excess weight adolescents increased their risky-decision-making after food exposure and this augmentation was associated with the increase in hunger levels. Increased hunger levels and risk-taking after food exposure could lead to overeating. Alterations in decision-making caused by food signals may be a long-term risk factor for the development of obesity in adulthood. In modern societies, with the high availability and continuous exposure to food cues, decision-making may be a crucial factor in maintain healthy eating habits in adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2888342420,"Because overall cranial morphology-biomechanics linkage in carnivorans is significantly influenced by both feeding and non-feeding ecological variables, whole-skull mechanical performance measures may be less sensitive to feeding ecology than regional characteristics within the skull. The temporomandibular joint could be one regional characteristic that is highly sensitive to feeding ecology considering that this joint is used in prey capture, food processing, and experiences compressive loading during mastication. Through 3D model construction, 3D printing, and compression tests, morphological and mechanical performance measures were determined for the temporomandibular joint trabecular bone structure of 40 species representative of the phylogenetic and ecology diversity of Carnivora. Remarkably, the results indicate that relative fill volume, relative structural complexity, elastic modulus, and relative maximum compressive strength of trabecular bone structure are not significantly related to phylogeny or ecology. The results reveal that morphological and mechanical performance attributes of trabecular bone structure are primarily influenced by body size, and that positive centroid size allometry and positive body mass allometry are present for structural complexity. The lack of feeding ecological signal in dorso-ventral compressive loading of temporomandibular joint models indicates that carnivoran temporomandibular joint trabecular structures may not undergo significant differential remodeling as an evolutionary response to different mechanically demanding feeding tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2888525247,"The stick insect is a well-established experimental animal to study the neural basis of walking. Here, we introduce a preparation that allows combining calcium imaging in efferent neurons with electrophysiological recordings of motor neuron activity in the stick insect thoracic nerve cord. The intracellular free calcium concentration in middle leg retractor coxae motor neurons and modulatory octopaminergic DUM neurons was monitored after backfilling lateral nerve nl5 that contains the axons of these neurons with the calcium indicator Oregon Green BAPTA-1. Rhythmic spike activity in retractor and protractor motor neurons was evoked by pharmacological activation of central pattern generating neuronal networks and recorded extracellularly from lateral nerves. A primary goal of this study was to investigate whether changes in the intracellular free calcium concentration observed in motor neurons during oscillatory activity depend on action potentials. We show that rhythmic spike activity in leg motor neurons induced either pharmacologically or by tactile stimulation of the animal is accompanied by a synchronous modulation in the intracellular free calcium concentration. Calcium oscillations in motor neurons do not appear to depend on calcium influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels that are gated by action potentials because Calcium oscillations persist after pharmacologically blocking action potentials in the motor neurons. Calcium oscillations were also apparent in the modulatory DUM neurons innervating the same leg muscle. However, the timing of calcium oscillations varied not only between DUM neurons and motor neurons, but also among different DUM neurons. Therefore, we conclude that the motor neurons and the different DUM neurons receive independent central drive."
https://openalex.org/W2888354572,"During the atmospheric correction of remote sensing data in inland waters, the original Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum-Vector version (6SV) model does not eliminate the specular reflection of downward skylight radiance at the air-water interface. Thus, we propose a modified version of the 6SV model (M6SV) that does remove reflected skylight at the air-water interface. We apply the new model to the atmospheric correction of a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image over Taihu Lake, China, where the aerosol optical depth is known. In situ reflectance measurements acquired concurrently with the L8/OLI image are used to validate the performance of the new M6SV algorithm. To further analyze the merits and demerits of M6SV, the model is compared with two short-wave infrared (SWIR)-based atmospheric correction models: the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor Data Analysis System short-wave infrared (SD-SWIR) model and the Vanhellemont & Ruddick short-wave infrared with a per scene fixed aerosol type (VR-SWIR-F) model. Comparisons of results from all three L8/OLI image atmospheric corrections with the in situ remote sensing reflectance data show that M6SV produces reliable atmospheric corrections in the green and red spectral bands and is an effective alternative for Landsat 8 OLI atmospheric correction in inland waters."
https://openalex.org/W2888513927,"Just 5 years after its first demonstration as a genome editing tool, CRISPR is pretty much a household name. From its humble beginnings as a way for bacteria to chop up invading viral DNA, CRISPR has taken over our discussions of animal models, high-throughput screens, GMOs, and gene therapy—even biomedical ethics and scientific patent law—all at breakneck speed. While CRISPR is not without its drawbacks, it has major advantages in that it is programmable and applicable to countless organisms, cell types, and research questions. With over 2,500 CRISPR papers published already in 2018, it’s easy to wonder whether there is anything truly new left under the sun. With CRISPR-mediated genome editing, the CRISPR enzyme makes a cut at the site specified by its guide RNA, and cellular repair processes take over to fix the DNA lesion, often introducing small insertions and deletions or stimulating homologous recombination at the site. This process leads to editing of the DNA sequence, allowing scientists to create point mutations; engineer nucleotide substitutions in regulatory regions; insert tags or reporter genes; or delete exons, genes, or sets of genes, for example. Now, two studies from the labs of Zhongjun Qin and Jef Boeke push the technology to its limits by using CRISPR to fuse entire yeast chromosomes together. Qin and colleagues took advantage of yeast’s superior homologous recombination efficiency to create one single, fused chromosome out of the native 16. Remarkably, the single-chromosome yeast cells had very similar cell growth and transcriptome to wild-type yeast (Shao et al., 2018Shao Y. Lu N. Wu Z. Cai C. Wang S. Zhang L.-L. Zhou F. Xiao S. Liu L. Zeng X. et al.Creating a functional single-chromosome yeast.Nature. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0382-xCrossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the study by Boeke and colleagues, the authors fused yeast chromosomes to create a two-chromosome yeast strain that is reproductively isolated from wild-type yeast, opening up the question of whether it can be classified as a separate species. Similar to the related paper, they also observed that the yeast cells with this drastically altered karyotype were viable with only slightly reduced growth rate (Luo et al., 2018Luo J. Sun X. Cormack B.P. Boeke J.D. Karyotype engineering by chromosome fusion leads to reproductive isolation in yeast.Nature. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0374-xCrossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moving CRISPR technology from gene editing to karyotype engineering holds promise to investigate fundamental questions in telomere and centromere biology, meiosis, speciation, and aneuploidy. Many of the technological innovations we’ve seen in the CRISPR world stem from its use as a sequence-specific DNA binding protein in the absence of cutting. A couple amino acid substitutions in the catalytic centers of the CRISPR enzyme and all of a sudden you have a module to recruit essentially anything you want to a particular location in the genome. Early work establishing this platform led to widely used technologies like CRISPRi and CRISPRa and, more recently, base editing. Turning up or down gene expression, changing epigenetic marks, recruiting transcription factors or fluorescent markers . . . it’s hard to imagine what hasn’t yet been done with CRISPR—until someone does it. A new paper by John Dueber and colleagues presents EvolvR, a CRISPR-based technology for targeted hypermutation and experimental evolution studies. The technique uses CRISPR-guided nickases to localize an error-prone DNA polymerase to specific endogenous or exogenous loci of interest. This approach led to nearly seven orders of magnitude increased mutation frequency in CRISPR-specified genomic windows of up to 350 base pairs, which can also be multiplexed to simultaneously mutate more than one region in the genome (Halperin et al., 2018Halperin S.O. Tou C.J. Wong E.B. Modavi C. Schaffer D.V. Dueber J.E. CRISPR-guided DNA polymerases enable diversification of all nucleotides in a tunable window.Nature. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0384-8Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Continuous sequence diversification of targeted loci is a major advance that paves the way for evolving new enzymatic activities, mapping drug targets and protein-protein interaction interfaces, and providing a barcode or “clock” for cellular lineage tracing. While we may think of CRISPR as primarily a cut-and-paste tool for the genome, several groups have recently developed its utility as a search tool. These new applications in CRISPR-based diagnostics stem from fundamental biochemical discoveries about the properties of some more recently discovered CRISPR effector enzymes, Cas12 and Cas13. Unlike the more famous Cas9, both of these enzymes are activated by a target sequence matching their guide RNA to then unleash a potent, non-specific, and multi-turnover nucleic acid cleavage activity. Cas12a recognizes a double-stranded DNA target and displays “collateral” cleavage against single-stranded DNA, whereas Cas13a acts on single-stranded RNA for both target- and non-specific activities. While this collateral activity may seem like a disadvantage for programmable editing applications with these effectors, it turns out that it can be harnessed as a powerful tool to report on nucleic acid detection. Based on principles first described by the labs of Feng Zhang and Jennifer Doudna, these diagnostic tools rely on activation of the CRISPR effector in the presence of a guide RNA-specified sequence, coupled with robust collateral cleavage activity against a reporter oligonucleotide that can be detected through fluorescence or other means when cut. Building on their previous work with Cas13-based RNA detection, Doudna and colleagues recently reported the development of Cas12a for DNA sequence detection, developing a sensitive system for attomolar detection of human papillomavirus in patient samples (Chen et al., 2018Chen J.S. Ma E. Harrington L.B. Da Costa M. Tian X. Palefsky J.M. Doudna J.A. CRISPR-Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity.Science. 2018; 360: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). Recent work from the Zhang lab achieved multiplexed, orthogonal detection of up to four target sequences simultaneously, including Dengue and Zika virus, also at attomolar concentrations. Looking forward to the potential for broad utility outside of the laboratory setting, the group modified their design from a fluorescent reporter to a colorimetric reporter that can be detected on a lateral flow strip (think: pregnancy test) (Gootenberg et al., 2018Gootenberg J.S. Abudayyeh O.O. Kellner M.J. Joung J. Collins J.J. Zhang F. Multiplexed and portable nucleic acid detection platform with Cas13, Cas12a, and Csm6.Science. 2018; 360: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Pardis Sabeti and colleagues reported the rapid development and use of lateral flow strip-based diagnostics to detect dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viral RNA directly from human urine, blood, serum, or saliva. The platform is also able to identify virus variants, potentially providing a means to quickly diagnose virulence-associated or drug resistance mutations in an outbreak (Myhrvold et al., 2018Myhrvold C. Freije C.A. Gootenberg J.S. Abudayyeh O.O. Metsky H.C. Durbin A.F. Kellner M.J. Tan A.L. Paul L.M. Parham L.A. et al.Field-deployable viral diagnostics using CRISPR-Cas13.Science. 2018; 360: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). These exciting innovations provide extremely fast and sensitive diagnostics that can be rapidly developed for virtually any new RNA- or DNA-based pathogen that arises and deployed in the field without the need for laboratory equipment. CRISPR-based diagnostics may also replace existing slow and cumbersome hospital tests for common genetic variants, such as cancer liquid biopsies (Gootenberg et al., 2018Gootenberg J.S. Abudayyeh O.O. Kellner M.J. Joung J. Collins J.J. Zhang F. Multiplexed and portable nucleic acid detection platform with Cas13, Cas12a, and Csm6.Science. 2018; 360: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), expanding their utility far beyond infectious disease. With innovative minds from so many fields and disciplines diving into the CRISPR world, the sky is the limit for dreaming up new and inventive CRISPR-based technologies. There is no doubt that these advances will continue accelerating the pace of discovery, expanding CRISPR’s reach to new frontiers and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in biology, agriculture, engineering, and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2888121192,"Trainings in emergency medicine are well structured, but examinations are rarely validated. We are evaluating the impact of pre-hospital emergency trainings on participants and patient care and developed and validated a checklist to assess emergency trainings.We used videos recorded at the time points directly before (t0), directly after (t1), and one year after (t2) training to develop the PERFECT checklist (Performance Assessment of Emergency Teams and Communication in Trauma Care). The videos were assessed using semi-qualitative/linguistic analysis as well as expert panel appraisal and recommendations using the Delphi method. The checklist was tested for validity and reliability.The inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.99) and internal consistency (α = 0.99) were high. Concurrent validity was moderate to high (r = 0.65 -r = 0.93 (p<0.001)). We included scales for procedures, non-technical skills, technical skills and global performance. The procedures were done faster in the mean over the timeline (t0: 2:29, 95%CI 1:54-3:03 min., t1: 1:11, 95%C 0:53-1:30 min, t2: 1:14, 95%CI 0:56-1:31 min.). All experts rated the recorded scenarios at t0 with the lowest sum score (mean 31±8), with a significantly better performance of the teams at t1 (mean 69±7). The performance at t2 (mean 66 ± 13) was slightly lower than at t1, but still better than at t0. At t1 and t2, linguistic analysis showed a change in the team leaders communication behaviour, which can be interpreted as a surrogate parameter for reduced stress.The PERFECT checklist has a good validity and high reliability for assessing trauma procedures and teamwork."
https://openalex.org/W2888442227,"The human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 differentiate into monocytes following treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). However, the mechanism underlying the differentiation of these cells in response to TPA has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we performed ChIP-seq profiling of RNA Pol II, HDAC2, Acetyl H3 (AcH3), and H3K27me3 and analyzed differential chromatin state changes during TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. We focused on atypically active genes, which showed enhanced H3 acetylation despite increased HDAC2 recruitment. We found that HDAC2 positively regulates the expression of these genes in a histone deacetylase activity-independent manner. HDAC2 interacted with and recruited paired box 5 (PAX5) to the promoters of the target genes and regulated HL-60 cell differentiation by PAX5-mediated gene activation. Taken together, these data elucidated the specific-chromatin status during HL-60 cell differentiation following TPA exposure and suggested that HDAC2 can activate transcription of certain genes through interactions with PAX5 in a deacetylase activity-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2888215562,"Recent microarray and RNAseq experiments provided evidence that glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) levels were decreased in extraocular muscles from human strabismic subjects compared to age-matched controls. We assessed the effect of sustained GDNF treatment of the superior rectus muscles of rabbits on their physiological and morphological characteristics, and these were compared to naïve control muscles. Superior rectus muscles of rabbits were implanted with a sustained release pellet of GDNF to deliver 2μg/day, with the contralateral side receiving a placebo pellet. After one month, the muscles were assessed using in vitro physiological methods. The muscles were examined histologically for alteration in fiber size, myosin expression patterns, neuromuscular junction size, and stem cell numbers and compared to age-matched naïve control muscles. GDNF resulted in decreased force generation, which was also seen on the untreated contralateral superior rectus muscles. Muscle relaxation times were increased in the GDNF treated muscles. Myofiber mean cross-sectional areas were increased after the GDNF treatment, but there was a compensatory increase in expression of developmental, neonatal, and slow tonic myosin heavy chain isoforms. In addition, in the GDNF treated muscles there was a large increase in Pitx2-positive myogenic precursor cells. One month of GDNF resulted in significant extraocular muscle adaptation. These changes are interesting relative to the decreased levels of GDNF in the muscles from subjects with strabismus and preliminary data in infant non-human primates where sustained GDNF treatment produced a strabismus. These data support the view that GDNF has the potential for improving eye alignment in subjects with strabismus."
https://openalex.org/W2888347779,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of fluvastatin on the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) into osteoblasts in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 6 (SAMP6) compared with that in the normal senescence-accelerated-resistant mouse (SAMR1) model. SAMP strains arose spontaneously from the AKR/J background and display shortened life span and an array of signs of accelerated aging, compared with control SAMR strains. The dose effects of fluvastatin were also evaluated. BMSCs were cultured with/without fluvastatin (0 μM, 0.1 μM, 0.5 μM, and 1.0 μM). WST-1-based colorimetry was performed to evaluate cell proliferation. To evaluate cell differentiation, gene expression levels of bmp2 and runx2 were determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and protein expression levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BMP2) and immunofluorescence staining (BMP2 and Runx2). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay and histochemical detection were determined; the effect of noggin, a BMP-specific antagonist, was examined using ALP histochemical detection. To assess for mature osteogenic marker, gene expression levels of bglap2 were determined by qRT-PCR and mineralization was determined by alizarin red staining. RhoA activity was also examined by Western blotting. In SAMP6, BMP2, Runx2 and Bglap2 mRNA and protein expressions were significantly increased by fluvastatin, and ALP activity was increased by BMP2 action. RhoA activity was also inhibited by fluvastatin. The concentration of fluvastatin sufficient to increase BMP2 and Runx2 expression and ALP activity was 0.5 μM in SAMP6 and 0.1 μM in SAMR1. In conclusion, the present study revealed that fluvastatin promoted BMSC differentiation into osteoblasts by RhoA-BMP2 pathway in SAMP6. BMSCs of SAMP6 are less sensitive to the osteogenic effects of fluvastatin than SAMR1."
https://openalex.org/W2888465140,"Fungi from the widely distributed genus Trichoderma are of great biotechnological interest, being currently used in a vast range of applications. Here, we report that high-molecular weight fraction (HWF) derived from Trichoderma asperelloides ethanolic extract exhibits antibiotic activity against staphylococcal biofilms. The antibacterial and anti-biofilm properties of T. asperelloides extracts were evaluated by well-established assays in Staphylococcus aureus ATCC strains (29213 and 6538) and in one clinical isolate from bovine mastitis. The HWF from T. asperelloides eradicated S. aureus by causing substantial matrix de-structuring and biomass reduction (p < 10-5) at concentrations as low as 2.3 μg mL-1. Additionally, we present ultra-structure analysis by the use of scanning electron microscopy as well as transmission microscopy, which showed that T. asperelloides killed cells through cell wall and membrane disturbance. Remarkably, the HWF from T. asperelloides killed S. aureus and eradicated its biofilms in a greater performance than gentamicin (p < 10-5), a known potent antibiotic against S. aureus. Our results indicate that extract from T. asperelloides may represent a promising candidate for the development of new antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2888539261,"Successful inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS) by pemetrexed, a TS inhibitor, results in a reproducible transient burst or ""flare"" in thymidine salvage pathway activity at 2 hrs. of therapy which can be measurable with FLT-PET ([18F]fluorothymidine-positron emission tomography) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Routine administration of dexamethasone with pemetrexed-based therapy could potentially confound this imaging approach since dexamethasone is known to inhibit expression of thymidine kinase 1, a key enzyme in the thymidine salvage pathway. Here we examine the potential impact of dexamethasone on the TS inhibition-mediated thymidine salvage pathway ""flare"" in NSCLC.In order to determine NSCLC cell line sensitivity to dexamethasone and pemetrexed, IC50 studies were performed on NSCLC cell lines H23, H1975, H460, H1299. TS inhibition-mediated ""flare"" in thymidine salvage pathway activity was then measured at 2hrs. of exposure to pemetrexed and cisplatin in NSCLC cells lines following using 3H-thymidine incorporation assays under the following conditions: control (no chemotherapy or dexamethasone), or treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin without dexamethasone, with 24 hrs. pre-treatment of dexamethasone or with dexamethasone administered together with chemotherapy. These conditions were chosen to model the delivery of pemetrexed-based therapy in the clinic.The IC50 of H23, H1975, H460, H1299 for dexamethasone and pemetrexed were 40, 5.9, 718, 362 μM and 0.22, 0.73, 0.14 and 0.66 μM respectively. Significant blunting of the thymidine salvage pathway ""flare"" is observed at 2hrs. of pemetrexed-based therapy when dexamethasone sensitive cell lines H23 and H1975 were pretreated with dexamethasone but not when dexamethasone was given together with pemetrexed therapy or in the setting of dexamethasone resistance (H460 and H1299).24 hr. pretreatment with dexamethasone, but not same day co-administration of dexamethasone with therapy, impairs the TS inhibition-mediated ""flare"" in thymidine salvage pathway activity in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2888153354,"Few studies have investigated the distribution of sexual orientation among Chinese university students and identified the socio-demographic factors associated with sexual orientation. For the present study, we administered a paper-based, 5-point, self-report, sexual orientation scale to a stratified, random sample of 9071 undergraduates across all 10 universities in Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou, China. Multivariable ordinal regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between demographic factors and sexual orientation. A total of 8320 respondents completed the survey. Of 8182 valid respondents, 80.6% self-reported as exclusively heterosexual, 12.6% self-reported as mostly heterosexual, 5.4% self-reported as bisexual, 0.7% self-reported as mostly homosexual, and 0.8% self-reported as exclusively homosexual. About one fifth of male students and one fourth of female students reported some degree of divergence from exclusive heterosexuality. This indicates that in China there are a large number of university students who are potentially involved in same-sex sexual attraction."
https://openalex.org/W2747549761,"Several case reports suggest that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use is associated with development of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). We conducted a matched population-based case-control study using linked administrative healthcare data in Ontario, Canada to assess the relationship between TMA hospitalization and recent exposure to prescription NSAIDs versus acetaminophen (acetaminophen was chosen as the referent drug because it has no known association with TMA). Cases and controls were drawn from a source population of adults who filled a prescription for either NSAIDs or acetaminophen between 1991 and 2015 (restricted to adults with prescription drug benefits [n = 3.6 million]). We identified 44 eligible cases with a hospital admission for incident TMA and a recent prescription for NSAIDs or acetaminophen. We successfully matched 38 cases (1:4) to 152 controls without TMA on demographics, risk factors for TMA, and indications for NSAID use. Cases and controls were similar with respect to age (71 years) and sex (63% women); however, on average, cases had more comorbidities than controls (12 vs. 14; p<0.05) and more primary care visits in the year before the index date (19 vs. 12; p<0.05). Cases were significantly less likely than controls to have received a recent prescription for NSAIDs (19/38 [50%] vs. 115/152 [76%], respectively; adjusted odds ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.16 to 0.84). Results were similar in several sensitivity analyses. Overall, the results of this study do not support a harmful association between NSAID use and the development of TMA."
https://openalex.org/W2888661714,"Expanding populations of North American midcontinent lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) have potential to alter ecosystems throughout the Arctic and subarctic where they breed. Efforts to understand origins of harvested lesser snow geese to better inform management decisions have traditionally required mark-recapture approaches, while aerial photographic surveys have typically been used to identify breeding distributions. As a potential alternative, isotopic patterns that are metabolically fixed within newly grown flight feathers following summer molting could provide inferences regarding geographic breeding origin of individuals, without the need for prior capture. Our objective was to assess potential to use four stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N, δ34S, δ2H) from feather material to determine breeding origins. We obtained newly grown flight feathers from individuals during summer banding at three Arctic and two subarctic breeding colonies in 2014 (n = 56) and 2016 (n = 45). We used linear discriminant analyses to predict breeding origins from models using combinations of stable isotopes as predictors and evaluated model accuracy when predicting colony, subregion, or subpopulation levels. We found a strong inverse relationship between δ2H values and increasing latitude (R2 = 0.83), resulting in differences (F4, 51 = 90.41, P < 0.0001) among sampled colonies. No differences in δ13C or δ15N were detected among colonies, although δ34S in Akimiski Island, Baffin Island, and Karrak Lake were more enriched (F4, 51 = 11.25, P < 0.0001). Using δ2H values as a predictor, discriminant analyses improved accuracy in classification level as precision decreased [model accuracy = 67% (colony), 88% (subregion), 94% (subpopulation)]. Application of the isotopic methods we describe could be used to provide an alternative monitoring method of population metrics, such as overall breeding population distribution, region-specific productivity and migratory connectivity that are informative to management decision makers and provide insight into cross-seasonal effects that may influence migratory behavior."
