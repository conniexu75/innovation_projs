https://openalex.org/W2083269383,"ON March 3, I made a prediction of the coronal structure of the March 7, 1970, eclipse of the Sun. The model employed is similar to that used for the prediction of the coronal structure at the eclipse of September 22, 1968, and details of the method are described in ref. 1. Observations of this eclipse seem to support2 the model: “there is a general similarity between the two drawings” (prediction and observation)3, and a sketch of the observations “agrees well with the prediction; had Schatten drawn his streamers more nearly radial, the agreement would have been almost perfect”4."

https://openalex.org/W2081107621,"DETAILED anatomical investigations have confirmed the presence on the Lancashire coast of Juncus hybrids with the parentage J. balticus × J. effusus, and J. balticus × J. inflexus. These hybrids are believed to be unique: neither has been found elsewhere in the world, despite the frequent co-habitation of the parents in parts of northern Europe. The programme of nature conservation being carried out in Lancashire, especially the creation of the National Nature Reserve at Ainsdale, is therefore particularly significant."

https://openalex.org/W4246191493,"BALL lightning is a rare phenomenen, which, because of its nature, is virtually impossible to record objectively. Carefully documented reports such as the one by Jennison1 are therefore valuable."
https://openalex.org/W4246452780,"JENNISON'S1 most unusual ball lightning observation brings several questions to mind: (a) Was the ball observed by the crew and other passengers, and if so, what were their reactions? (b) Did the crew in the pilot's cabin report any damage to or unusual behaviour of the electrical equipment ? (c) Where and how did the flight of the ball terminate ? (d) Was the airplane interior pressurized, and at what approximate altitude was the plane flying ? (e) Why did the observer wait more than six years to report on such an interesting phenomenon ?"
https://openalex.org/W2027434534,"FRYE et al.1 have reported evidence for a point source of γ-rays, Sgr γ-1, with an intensity Isgrγ–1 (> 50 MeV) = (3 ± 1) × 10−5 photons cm−2 s−1. It was seen in two separate balloon flights in February 1969 at a significance level of about three standard deviations of the background rate. Frye et al. give the coordinates of the source as right ascension = 19 h 12 m ± 12 m and declination = −35° ± 2°."
