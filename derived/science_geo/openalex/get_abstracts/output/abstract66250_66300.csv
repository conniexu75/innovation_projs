https://openalex.org/W1507243792,"Abstract Glycoprotein, glycolipid, protein, and lipid synthesis was measured in isolated sterile synaptosomes and sterile intraneural mitochondria by the incorporation of radioactive precursors into endogenous macromolecules. The purity of two synaptosomal preparations and three intraneural mitochondria preparations from male guinea pig cortices was assayed by marker enzymes. The preparation of intraneural mitochondria used in the experiments was free of nonmitochondrial (contaminating) enzymes and showed a high specific activity of the mitochondrial enzymes monoamine oxidase and succinic dehydrogenase. Leucine and glycine and, to a lesser extent, aspartic acid were incorporated into protein by both synaptosomes and intraneural mitochondria. Monosaccharides from UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, GDP-mannose, and glucosamine were incorporated into both glycoprotein and glycolipid by the isolated synaptosomes and intraneural mitochondria but no incorporation of UDP-xylose or UDP-arabinose occurred. Chloramphenicol at levels of 83 µg per ml of incubation mixture inhibited protein synthesis in the intraneural mitochondria to 60% of normal activity; higher levels caused even greater inhibition. Cycloheximide at 0.83 mg per ml inhibited protein synthesis in the intraneural mitochondria to about 70% of normal activity; 6.66 mg per ml caused inhibition to 40% normal activity. Glycoprotein synthesis was inhibited in the intraneural mitochondria by both antibiotics but to a lesser extent than protein synthesis. Glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis in the intraneural mitochondria showed a marked requirement for divalent cations, with Mn++ being the best activator; some ions substituted for Mn++ but others were inhibitory to incorporation. Neither glycoprotein nor protein synthesis was adversely affected by RNase in either synaptosomes or the intraneural mitochondria. Identification of the radioactive products indicated some epimerization of the sugars before incorporation into the macromolecules. The reactions for glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis showed broad temperature dependence with optimum temperatures of about 37°. The reactions were linear with respect to time for only 15 to 45 min."

https://openalex.org/W1546954318,"Abstract The pH profile obtained for enzymes in rat liver homogenate which hydrolyze glycerol esters of decanoic acid shows two distinct peaks of activity, one at pH 5 to 5.2 and the other at pH 8.6 to 9. The activity at acid pH is associated with lysosomes, and that at alkaline pH with microsomes. Glycerol tri-, 1,2-di-, and 1-monodecanoate are hydrolyzed by lysosomes in decreasing order of activity, and by microsomes in increasing order of activity. When soluble lysosomal lipase hydrolyzed glycerol tri(oleate-1-14C), the percentage of radioactivity recovered in the products was as follows: oleic acid, 40%; glycerol 1,2-dioleate, 52%; glycerol 1,3-dioleate, 8%; and glycerol monooleate, 0%. Complete solubilization of lysosomal lipase is achieved by suspending the lysosomal pellet in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Lysosomal lipase is strongly inhibited by certain sulfhydryl reagents. A comparison of lipase activity in liver lysosomes with that in Triton WR 1339-filled liver lysosomes, as well as the limitations imposed by the use of Triton-filled lysosomes, is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2044049243,"CRYSTALS of amino-acids may exhibit the property of piezoelectricity1–4 and, like other crystals, may belong to one of the twenty-one so-called piezoelectric crystalline classes5. Our particular interest in investigating piezoelectric resonances in amino-acids was in connexion with our current study of nuclear quadrupole resonances (NQR). For this purpose, it is preferable to choose non-piezoelectric amino-acids so that there is no interference in the detection of the quadrupole spectra6,7."

https://openalex.org/W1998709361,Polyinosinic acid ⋅ polycytidylic acid (poly I ⋅ poly C) inhibits isoproterenol-stimulated DNA synthesis in salivary glands of mice. A single intraperitoneal injection of 250 micrograms of poly I ⋅ poly C inhibits the stimulation of DNA synthesis when given 10 minutes before isoproterenol or at any time during the 20-hour lag period between the injection of isoproterenol and the subsequent DNA synthesis. The inhibition caused by poly I ⋅ poly C is not due to a generalized toxic action but seems to be exerted through a relatively selective mechanism. Polyuridylic acid and diethylaminoethyl dextran are less effective in inhibiting isoproterenol-stimulated DNA synthesis.

The differences between chromosome complements are mainly due to translocations between autosomes, and to translocations between autosomes and sex chromosomes. The geographic pattern of chromosome variation and the characteristics of hybrids implicate chromosomal rearrangements in mechanisms of speciation."

https://openalex.org/W2055718029,"Ipomoea muricata Jacq. (Calonyction muricatum G. Don) has now been confirmed as the biological origin of the Ipomoea seed mentioned in a previous communication1. Seeds of Indian origin (obtained by courtesy of Dr O. Fervidi, Simes Servizi Scientifici, Milan), identical to those from Pakistan, showed on germination in Beirut the typical shape and size of the cotyledonary and first leaves of Ipomoea muricata Jacq. described by Kassner2. The identity was further confirmed by the characteristically tubercled stem3 and the aristate sepals4. Kaladana seeds, obtained from Pakistan (Gohar and Co., Karachi) in 1965 and 1967, differed from the original seeds (and those from India) in being hairy and greyish-black but otherwise identical to the original seeds in size and shape. All the seeds, however, had identical alkaloid chromatograms. A few of the 1967 seeds were grown in Lafayette, in 1968 (by courtesy of Dr J. E. Robbers, Purdue University, Lafayette). Seeds obtained from these plants and grown in Beirut produced plants identical to those obtained from the Indian seeds. Strangely enough, the seeds obtained from Lafayette were devoid of alkaloids. In this connexion it is interesting to note that Der Marderossian5 reports no indole alkaloids from “I. Muricata”. Besides lysergol and chanoclavine-I, reported1 as present in Kaladana seed, other alkaloids were also found but in much smaller amounts6."

This could be counterbalanced by a unilateral change of the signal intensity. Further unilateral lengthening of the stimulus did not affect the sound localization, but it revealed a masking aftereffect (4 to 10 milliseconds) of the binaural signal. The data define the temporal characteristics of binaural effect influenced the binaural interaction."
