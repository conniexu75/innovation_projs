Consequently, copper transport at the cell surface and the delivery of copper to intracellular proteins are critical events in normal physiology. Little is known about the molecules and biochemical mechanisms responsible for copper uptake at the plasma membrane in mammals. Here, we demonstrate that human Ctr1 (hCtr1) is a component of the copper transport machinery at the plasma membrane. hCtr1 transports copper with high affinity in a time-dependent and saturable manner and is metal-specific. hCtr1-mediated 64Cu transport is an energy-independent process and is stimulated by extracellular acidic pH and high K+ concentrations. hCtr1 exists as a homomultimer at the plasma membrane in mammalian cells. This is the first report on the biochemical characterization of the human copper transporter hCtr1, which is important for understanding mechanisms for mammalian copper transport at the plasma membrane.

Dietary copper limitation studies in animals, as well as the existence of human genetic diseases of copper homeostasis such as Menkes and Wilson disease, underscore critical roles for proper copper absorption in the intestine and distribution to the organs and tissues to serve as an essential biochemical co-factor for these enzymatic activities and other important biological processes (3Danks D.M.

At the cellular level, copper is transported at the plasma membrane and distributed to cellular proteins and compartments for the incorporation of copper into copper-dependent proteins. Studies in yeast cells first identified genes encoding high affinity copper ion transport proteins in the plasma membrane. Either prior to or concomitant with high affinity uptake, Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) by one or more metalloreductases encoded by the FRE1through FRE7 genes (7Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol.

Recently, candidates for human and murine copper transporters have been isolated by complementation of yeast Ctr mutants and by data base homology searches (19Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 20Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Mammalian Ctr1 mRNA is expressed in all tissues examined, with relatively high expression levels in liver and kidney and lower levels in the brain and spleen (19Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 20Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Murine Ctr1 displays 92% sequence identity to human Ctr1 and maps to a syntenic locus in the mouse genome (20Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). While mammalian Ctr1 functionally complements several growth phenotypes associated with yeast cells lacking the Ctr1 and Ctr3 high affinity copper transporters, and there are structural similarities among known copper transporters in yeast and putative copper transporters in mammals, little is known about the function and biochemical characteristics of human Ctr1 in copper uptake in mammalian cells. We have examined the kinetics of copper transport, metal specificity, localization, oligomerization, and roles for energy and an electrochemical gradient at the plasma membrane in copper uptake by the functional expression of hCtr11 in a human embryonic kidney (Hek293) cell line. Our studies demonstrate that hCtr1 is a component of a plasma membrane copper transporter system. hCtr1 oligomerizes and transports copper with specificity and in a time-, concentration-, and extracellular pH- and K+-dependent manner. Given the known importance of mouse Ctr1 in copper homeostasis and embryonic development, as demonstrated by the characterization of Ctr1 gene knock-out mice (21Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar,22Kuo Y.M. Zhou B. Cosco D. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6836-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), the biochemical properties established here are consistent with mammalian Ctr1 playing a key role in copper acquisition across the plasma membrane and provide fundamental information for understanding copper transport mechanisms by hCtr1 protein. The human Ctr1 open reading frame, with Kozak translation initiation sequences in the 5′-untranslated region (23Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), was PCR-amplified from the hCtr1 cDNA clone (20Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) using human hCtr1-specific primer sets. For amino-terminal epitope-tagging of hCtr1, a NotI restriction enzyme site was generated in the upstream PCR primer just after the translation initiation codon. PCR products were inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI sites in the pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and p413-GPD (24Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) vectors for the expression of hCtr1 in human embryonic kidney cells (Hek293) and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. A DNA fragment encoding one c-Myc epitope was inserted into the NotI restriction enzyme site within the hCtr1 open reading frame. The function of the c-Myc-tagged hCtr1 allele was compared with the wild type allele by complementation studies in the S. cerevisiae strain MPY17 (25Peña M.M.O. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2514-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), harboring deletions of the CTR1 and CTR3 genes, in which copper transport-competent cells are able to utilize nonfermentable carbon sources for growth and by 64Cu uptake assays in transfected Hek293 cells. Hek293 cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) under 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1 expressing the human Ctr1 cDNA under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Transfections were performed using FuGENETM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We observed a range of transfection from 50 to 70% in Hek293 cells. 24 h after transfection, cells were collected from transfected dishes and evenly divided for copper uptake assays. Radioactive copper (64Cu) was purchased from the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University (Saint Louis, MO). The average specific activity of 64Cu was 16 mCi/μg of copper in the form of CuCl2 in 0.1 m HCl. 64Cu was added to Hek293 cell culture medium 2 days after transfection with empty vector or the hCtr1 expression vector. Stimulation of copper uptake in Hek293 cells by the expression of hCtr1 was measured by incubating the cells with 2 μm64Cu in DMEM with or without 10% FBS, Hepes-buffered salt solution (HBSS) (pH 7.5), or HBSS with 0.2% bovine serum albumin or 50 μmhistidine. HBSS (pH 7.5) contains 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes. For time course studies, cells cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS were incubated for 2–60 min with 5 μm64Cu. For dose-response assays, cells were incubated with 0.25–25 μm64Cu for 5 min. For metal competition assays, 10- or 50-fold molar excess concentrations of nonradioactive metals (CuCl2, FeCl2, ZnCl2, MnCl2, AgNO3, or CdSO4) (Sigma) were added to cell growth medium with 64Cu for 5 min. To study the effects of reductant on hCtr1-stimulated 64Cu uptake, ascorbate (1 mm final concentration) was added to copper uptake medium simultaneously with the 64Cu addition. After incubations, the uptake medium was aspirated, and copper uptake was quenched by adding ice-cold EDTA (10 mm in PBS). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, PBS buffer for cell lysis. Aliquots of cell lysate were counted using a γ-counter (Packard Cobra II). Parallel experiments were conducted at 4 °C for cell surface64Cu binding, which was subtracted from the values at 37 °C to obtain net copper uptake values. Copper uptake was calculated using a standard curve and normalized to protein concentrations of cell lysates. Vmax andKm were determined via extrapolation to zero in the reciprocal plot for velocity versus substrate concentration using GraphPad PRISMTM software. Hek293 cells with or without hCtr1 expression plasmid transfection were preincubated for 60 min with metabolic inhibitors before 64Cu uptake assays were performed. Stock solutions of antimycin A, oligomycin, or ouabain (Sigma) in 95% ethanol or sodium azide in water were prepared. Antimycin A (3.6 μm), oligomycin (4.7 μm), sodium azide (0.1 mm) or ouabain (1 mm) was added into culture medium in a volume of less that 0.5% of culture medium for a 60-min preincubation before 64Cu transport was measured. The concentration of and length of preincubation with metabolic inhibitors were based on previous studies (26Schmitt R.C. Darwish H.M. Cheney J.C. Ettinger M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: G183-G191PubMed Google Scholar), and the efficacy of treatment was confirmed by the energy-dependent [3H]taurocholate transport assay (see below). To test the effect of pH on copper uptake, cells were preincubated for 15 min in HBSS (pH 7.5) with or without 0.2% bovine serum albumin, Pipes-buffered salt solution (PBSS; substitution of Pipes for Hepes of HBSS, pH 6.5), or MES-buffered salt solution (MBSS; substitution of MES for Hepes of HBSS, pH 5.5), and then 2 μm64Cu was added to the buffer for 5 min. To investigate the effects of sodium or potassium content of the buffer on64Cu uptake, NaCl in HBSS was replaced by KCl or choline chloride, and 64Cu uptake assays were performed. Valinomycin (1.4 μm), a K+-selective ionophore, was dissolved in glacial acetate, diluted in water, and added in uptake buffer in a volume of less than 0.5% of culture medium for 30 min before 64Cu uptake measurements. All control experiments were performed with the addition of the same amount of solvents used for dissolving chemicals. The ileal bile acid transporter expression plasmid (27Saeki T. Matoba K. Furukawa H. Kirifuji K. Kanamoto R. Iwami K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or empty vector was transfected into Hek293 cells by the method as described for hCtr1 expression. Two days after transfection, cells were incubated with oligomycin (4.7 μm) or ouabain (1 mm) in cell culture medium (DMEM with 10% FBS) for 1 h, and then [3H]taurocholate was added to a final concentration of 250 μm for 5 min. After incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm cold taurocholate (Sigma). Cells were solubilized, and aliquots were taken to determine radioactivity and protein concentration. [3H]Taurocholate (74 GBq/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Total protein was extracted from Hek293 cells 2 days after transfection with the Myc epitope-tagged hCtr1 expression plasmid. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mmsucrose, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cells were then homogenized by 15 passages through a 23-gauge needle and 40 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected for total protein extract. Total protein extract was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was collected, and the pellet (membrane fraction) was resuspended in buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4)/2 mm EDTA), 0.2m sodium carbonate (pH 11), or 1% Triton X-100 at a final concentration of less than 1 mg of protein/ml. The suspensions were incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant containing remaining soluble and detached peripheral membrane proteins was precipitated in trichloroacetic acid (10%), washed twice with acetone, and resuspended in SDS buffer. After incubation at 37 °C, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to detect hCtr1-Myc protein. G protein β subunit antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was used as a control to demonstrate that peripheral membrane proteins are released by treatment of the membranes with 0.2 m sodium carbonate, pH 11. Hek293 cells were harvested 2 days after transfection with the c-Myc epitope-tagged hCtr1 expression vector and seeded onto a polylysine-coated cover glass. Cells were cultured for 24 h, washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized by treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were treated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclear DNA staining and anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L)-conjugated fluorescein (Oregon Green) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) to detect hCtr1-Myc. Cover glasses were mounted on slides with mounting medium (Molecular Probes) and fluorescence signals were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-2 cooled CCD camera. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 software. Total protein extracts were obtained from Hek293 cells expressing c-Myc epitope-tagged hCtr1 harvested 2 days after transfection, washed two times with PBS, and lysed with buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). 30 μg of protein were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with increasing concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mm) of ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) from stock solutions in Me2SO. The volume of Me2SO in each reaction was no more than 10% of the total reaction volume. Cross-linking reactions were quenched with 45 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by incubation at room temperature for an additional 30 min. The cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody. Previously, we and others isolated a human cDNA that encodes a protein which functionally complements phenotypes associated with S. cerevisiae cells defective in high affinity copper transport (19Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 20Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Based on these functional observations, the similar predicted topological arrangements and primary structural homology to the S. cerevisiae high affinity copper transport proteins Ctr1 and Ctr3 and the S. pombe copper transporters Ctr4 and Ctr5, human Ctr1 has been postulated to encode a mammalian high affinity copper transporter (19Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 20Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J.

To ascertain whether hCtr1 plays a role in copper transport in human cells, hCtr1 protein was expressed in Hek293 cells by transient transfection of an expression plasmid carrying the hCtr1 open reading frame under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The initial rate of copper uptake was measured in Hek293 cells expressing hCtr1 by incubation of the cells with 2 μm64Cu for 5 min, and the effects of potential copper ligands in serum, such as albumin and histidine, on hCtr1-stimulated 64Cu uptake were examined.64Cu accumulation in the vector control cells indicates the presence of a low level of copper uptake in Hek293 cells (Fig.1), consistent with low but detectable levels of hCtr1 mRNA detected in these cells by RNA blotting analysis (data not shown). hCtr1 expression stimulates the initial rate of 64Cu uptake 3–7-fold over vector-transfected control cells, depending on the transfection efficiency in each experiment (Fig. 1). Interestingly, stimulation of copper uptake by hCtr1 expression is more obvious when 64Cu uptake is measured in DMEM cell culture medium rather than HBSS (Fig. 1). It has been reported that copper in mammalian serum is bound to ligands such as albumin and histidine; thus, these serum ligands may play an important role in the copper uptake process (1Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar). We examined potential roles of serum components by measuring copper uptake in DMEM with or without 10% serum and in HBSS with or without albumin and histidine.64Cu uptake is significantly higher in HBSS compared with DMEM with or without serum, which suggests that components of DMEM and serum, such as amino acids and albumin, inhibit copper uptake (Fig. 1). Furthermore, since copper uptake in HBSS is inhibited by supplementation with albumin or histidine (Fig. 1), copper may be dissociated from these ligands for hCtr1-mediated transport. 64Cu accumulation was examined in Hek293 cells both as a function of time and copper concentration (Fig.2). copper accumulation was measured by incubating cells with 64Cu in DMEM culture medium with 10% serum, because we could clearly observe stimulation of 64Cu uptake in the Hek293 cells expressing hCtr1 under these conditions compared with other uptake buffer conditions (Fig. 1). 64Cu uptake in cells transfected with the hCtr1 expression plasmid was stimulated, in a time-dependent manner, with a greater than 30-fold stimulation over vector-transfected cells at 60 min (Fig.2A). A copper dose-response analysis demonstrated that copper uptake is concentration-dependent and saturable (Fig. 2B). Further analysis of these data (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicates an apparentKm for copper uptake in vector-transfected Hek293 cells under these experimental conditions of 2.56 ± 1.04 μm and a Vmax of 1.45 ± 0.17 pmol of Cu/min/mg of protein. Transfected cells expressing hCtr1-Myc manifests a Km of 1.71 ± 0.39 μm, similar to the endogenous system, and aVmax of 6.76 ± 0.39 pmol of Cu/mg of protein/min, as expected for increased hCtr1 expression as compared with wild type levels indicated by RNA blotting experiments (data not shown). These results demonstrate that hCtr1 stimulates high affinity copper transport when expressed in cultured human cells. We examined whether the endogenous copper uptake activity in Hek293 cells, and cells expressing transfected hCtr1, transport other metals or whether these are relatively specific copper transport activities. 10- or 50-fold molar excesses of copper or five other nonradioactive metals (iron, zinc, manganese, silver, and cadmium) were independently added to the64Cu uptake medium to test whether these metals could compete for 64Cu uptake. Co-incubation with a 10-fold molar excess of nonradioactive copper inhibited more than 90%64Cu uptake for both the endogenous (Fig.3A) and hCtr1-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Among the other metals tested, only Ag(I) displayed similar inhibitory potency as copper on 64Cu uptake, suggesting that Ag(I) may also be a substrate for transport by hCtr1 and that Cu(I) is transported by hCtr1. Consistently, supplementation of ascorbic acid (1 mm) in DMEM plus 10% FBS to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) enhances 64Cu uptake approximately 2-fold (data not shown). 50-fold molar excesses of zinc, iron, or cadmium also significantly inhibited 64Cu uptake, and we could not observe a significant effect of ascorbate on the competition by these metals (data not shown). Therefore, iron, zinc, and cadmium either may be low affinity substrates for the copper transport system or may simply inactivate the endogenous and hCtr1-mediated copper transport activities at very high concentrations. To investigate these possibilities, we treated cells for 5 min with 50-fold molar excesses of competitor metals, washed cells to remove competitor, and then measured 64Cu uptake, but we observed no effect of iron, zinc, manganese, or cadmium pretreatment on64Cu uptake (data not shown). We did, however, observe an ∼10–15% inhibition of 64Cu uptake by pretreatment with copper or silver (data not shown), suggesting that these metals were either incompletely washed away or that there was some as yet uncharacterized form of regulation by these specific metals. The lack of strong competition by metals except copper and silver at a 10-fold molar excess is probably not due to chelation of these metals by components of the culture medium, since we observe the same pattern of metal-specific competition for 64Cu uptake in HBSS (data not shown). Therefore, we suggest that zinc, iron, and cadmium may be either reversible inhibitors or low affinity substrates of hCtr1 protein. Taken together, these results suggest that both the endogenous copper transport system and hCtr1 comprise rather metal-specific high affinity copper transport activities. Mammalian and yeast Ctr family copper transporter proteins do not possess an obvious ATP-binding domain, suggesting that copper uptake by the Ctr1 protein may not be energy-dependent. However, it is possible that ATP hydrolysis is required for high affinity copper transport and that other components of a functional copper transporter complex may hydrolyze ATP. We tested this hypothesis by pretreatment of cells with metabolic inhibitors to decrease ATP levels and carried out copper uptake experiments. Treatment of cells with antimycin A, oligomycin, or sodium azide did not inhibit 64Cu uptake in Hek293 cells by either the endogenous system or in hCtr1-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). The efficacy of metabolic inhibitor treatment under these conditions was evident by the demonstration that oligomycin inhibited the activity of the ATP-dependent bile acid transporter, expressed in Hek293 cells, while there is no inhibition of hCtr1-mediated 64Cu transport (Fig. 4B). These data strongly suggest that hCtr1-mediated copper transport is not an energy-dependent process. Previous studies have shown that a number of nutrient and ion transporters, including DCT1 (Nramp2, DMT1), a divalent metal transporter that has a broad substrate range including iron and copper, mediate active transport that is proton-coupled and dependent on cell membrane potential (29Gunshin H.

We tested whether either endogenous or hCtr1-stimulated copper transport in 293 cells may be mediated by an electrochemical gradient by conducting 64Cu transport assays in buffers of different pH. Indeed, copper accumulation in Hek293 cells was significantly increased at pH 6.5 and 5.5 compared with pH 7.5 (Fig. 5A), for hCtr1-transfected cells, although the endogenous activity was not as strongly stimulated at low pH. It is well established that some transport activities, such as the glucose transporter, are monovalent cation-dependent processes (31Wright E.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, we have tested whether the alteration of extracellular Na+ or K+ concentrations affect hCtr1-mediated copper uptake. Incubation of Hek293 cells with high K+ buffer (115 mm) significantly increased copper accumulation compared with low K+ buffer (5 mm), and the use of choline chloride indicates that this is not due to decreased Na+ concentrations (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with ouabain, a potent Na+-K+-ATPase inhibitor, to increase intracellular Na+ concentrations did not alter copper accumulation in Hek293 cell by the endogenous transporter or in hCtr1 expression vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). However, the K+ ionophore valinomycin increased copper accumulation, although, as expected, K+ inonophore treatment in a high extracellular K+ buffer did not"

The intracellular segment of TNFR1 responsible for NF-κB activation has been mapped to a discrete 70-amino acid homotypic interaction domain termed the “death domain” (DD). The DD is one of four recognized homotypic interaction motifs that form the “molecular glue” holding together components of the apoptotic machinery. The DD, caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), death effector domain, and PYRIN motifs are variants of a common death fold composed of six α-helical bundles with Greek key topology (3Weber C.H.

The DD-containing adapter molecule TRADD (TNFreceptor-associated deathdomain protein) is recruited to TNFR1, followed by the DD-containing Ser/Thr kinase RIP. RIP-deficient cells from knockout mice and a human mutant Jurkat cell line fail to activate NF-κB in response to TNF, indicating that RIP is required for TNFR1-induced NF-κB activation (6Ting A.T.

RIP kinase autophosphorylates itself at Ser/Thr residues, although the precise residues that are phosphorylated have not been identified. Surprisingly, the kinase domain is not required for activation of NF-κB.

Previously, we reported that RIP3 physically associates with RIP to inhibit RIP- and TNFR1-induced NF-κB activation (22Sun X. Lee J. Navas T. Baldwin D.T. Stewart T.A. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16871-16875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Here, we report the identification of a new homotypic interaction motif required for the association of RIP3 with RIP. Furthermore, we found that the kinase activity of RIP3 is important for inhibition of NF-κB activation. All eukaryotic expression vectors were constructed in pCMV2-FLAG (N-terminal FLAG tag), pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (C-terminal Myc tag), or pGST (N-terminal GST tag) using standard PCR techniques employing custom-designed primers containing appropriate restriction sites. Alanine cluster mutations were done using the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The presence of the introduced mutation and the fidelity of PCR replication were confirmed by sequence analysis. The pGEX-2T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used for expression of GST-tagged RIP3 and RIP truncations inEscherichia coli. Mouse anti-RIP3 monoclonal antibody was raised against a His-tagged C-terminal 218-amino acid segment of RIP3, which was then expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS cells. Anti-RIP3 polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide composed of the last C-terminal 20 amino acids of RIP3. HEK293E, human U937, and Jurkat cells were cultured as previously described (6Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 8Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Constructs expressing deletions and mutations of RIP and RIP3 were transiently transfected into HEK293E cells using FuGENE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Jurkat cells were electroporated at 270 V and 960 microfarads in a 4-mm gap cuvette using 15 μg of a mixture of DNAs containing a 3:1 ratio of RIP or RIP3 plasmid versus the SV40κB-luc reporter. CrmA was included in all transfections at a 1:1 molar ratio to suppress cell death caused by RIP and RIP3. Luciferase assays were performed using the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega). Transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1× Tris-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For Western analysis, lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), and immunoblotted. For immunoprecipitation, 107 cells were lysed in lysis buffer and precleared with nonspecific antibody and protein G-agarose (Sigma). Lysates were then incubated with the indicated antibodies, and immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose. Following extensive washing, beads were boiled in sample buffer, and the released material was subjected to Western blot analysis. For endogenous association and recruitment experiments, human U937 cells were used. A monoclonal antibody to TNFR1 (Genentech, Inc.) was used to immunoprecipitate the TNFR1 complex, which was analyzed directly or subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. The TNFR1 complex was dissociated in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% SDS, which was then diluted 10-fold with lysis buffer before it was subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation. RIP3 was cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH), transfected into COS-7 cells, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100, and stained with anti-RIP monoclonal antibody. Bound anti-RIP antibody (Pharmingen) was detected using a Cy5-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). RIP3 was visualized by green fluorescence. Cells were examined and photographed by confocal microscopy (Leica SP). Immunoprecipitated endogenous TNFR1 complex and various RIP and RIP3 proteins obtained from transfected 293E cells were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay as described previously (8Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions for the minimal binding segments of RIP and RIP3 were performed using the programs DSC (23King R.D. Sternberg M.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2298-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and PHD (24Rost B. Sander C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Threading calculations were performed using the program ProFit (ProCeryon Biosciences, Inc.). Analysis of the C terminus of RIP3 revealed a stretch of 16 amino acids that was highly homologous to a region in the intermediate domain of RIP: 8 of 16 contiguous residues were identical, and 14 of 16 were conserved. To elucidate the functional significance of this region, we generated a series of C-terminal RIP truncations. Cotransfection studies revealed that 20 amino acids encompassing the core 16 residues were required for binding of RIP to RIP3 (Fig.1 A). Only truncated forms of RIP that contained this conserved region bound RIP3 (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 5–7). Similar truncation analysis of RIP3 revealed that an equivalent stretch of 24 residues containing the 16 core residues was required for association with RIP (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1, 3, and4). To further characterize this novel homotypic interaction motif, we generated alanine cluster substitutions within the conserved and flanking regions. Alanine substitutions within the core 16 residues significantly disrupted the association between RIP and RIP3, whereas alanine substitutions outside the core region did not (Fig.1 C). Therefore, this stretch of 16 residues forms the essential core of a novel homotypic interaction motif, the RHIM. To elucidate the minimal region of RIP3 that is sufficient for homotypic binding, a series of GST-RIP3 fusion proteins were tested for their ability to bind to RIP. GST-RIP3-(411–474) retained the ability to bind RIP, indicating that this stretch of 64 amino acids is sufficient to confer RIP binding (Fig.2 B). Similar experiments were conducted using GST-RIP fusion proteins. GST-RIP-(501–588) bound RIP3, whereas a more truncated version, GST-RIP-(501–551), bound RIP3 only weakly (Fig. 2 C). To address the question of whether these two minimal binding segments can bind each other, FLAG-RIP3-(411–474) was coexpressed with GST-RIP-(501–588) or, as a negative control, GST-E10 (25Yan M. Lee J. Schilbach S. Goddard A. Dixit V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10287-10292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Only GST-RIP-(501–588) bound FLAG-RIP3-(411–474), consistent with the notion that the two RHIMs in RIP and RIP3 bind each other (Fig. 2 D). To confirm a direct association between the two RHIMs, GST-RIP3-(388–518) and GST-RIP-(496–583) were coexpressed in E. coli and were found to copurify on glutathione-Sepharose as a soluble complex. RIP3 was then cleaved from GST by thrombin and separated on a sizing column. RIP and RIP3, both containing the core RHIM, coeluted during gel filtration, indicating that these fragments of RIP and RIP3 can interact directly (Fig. 2 E). These results also indicate that residues outside the core regions are required for mutual interaction of the RHIMs. Interestingly, secondary structure predictions using two different methods suggested that the minimal binding fragments of RIP and RIP3 are predominantly coil-like. However, the RHIMs were predicted to have β-hairpin structures with turns centered around NSTG (residues 534–537) of RIP and NCSG (residues 454–457) of RIP3. These predictions were supported by “threading” analysis (data not shown). Confocal microscopy was used to ascertain the cellular localization of RIP and RIP3. Ectopically expressed green fluorescent protein-tagged RIP3 colocalized with endogenous RIP in punctate structures (Fig.3 A), distinct from labeled mitochondria (data not shown). To detect association of endogenous RIP and RIP3 within the TNFR1 signaling complex, a monoclonal antibody against RIP3 was generated. Previous studies have shown that RIP is recruited to the TNFR1 signaling complex upon TNF treatment (8Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have reported that upon overexpression, RIP3 can be recruited to the TNFR1 complex by RIP (22Sun X. Lee J. Navas T. Baldwin D.T. Stewart T.A. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16871-16875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To determine whether endogenous RIP3 is recruited to the TNFR1 complex in a TNF-dependent manner, TNFR1 was immunoprecipitated from U937 cells with or without prior exposure to TNF. Endogenous RIP complexed with TNFR1 in a TNF-dependent manner (Fig.3 B), but endogenous RIP3 could not be detected by immunoblotting due to poor reactivity of the anti-RIP3 antibody. Because RIP3 is a kinase, in vitro kinase reactions offered a more sensitive method of detection. Following immunoprecipitation with anti-TNFR1 antibody, the TNFR1 signaling complex was subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction, and the complex was disrupted and subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation using antibody against RIP or RIP3. Using this protocol, we could detect recruitment of both RIP and RIP3 to the TNFR1 complex after TNF treatment (Fig.3 C). Many other proteins in the TNFR1 complex were also phosphorylated (Fig. 3 C, lane 4), some of which likely represent components of the TNFR1 signalosome (26Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Because RIP3 binds RIP, we determined whether RIP and RIP3 could phosphorylate each other. An in vitro kinase assay showed RIP3 to be the stronger autophosphorylating kinase. Furthermore, RIP3 could phosphorylate RIP, but the converse was not observed (data not shown). To address whether the phosphorylation of RIP by RIP3 was specific, kinase-dead RIP(K45A) and the indicated RIP3 constructs were expressed in HEK293E cells, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. The use of catalytically inert RIP(K45A) in this assay eliminated interference from autophosphorylation. RIP(K45A) was phosphorylated in the presence of wild-type RIP3, but not in the presence of a kinase-dead RIP3 mutant (Fig. 3 E, lanes 2 and 3). Importantly, mutation of the RIP3 RHIM abrogated RIP phosphorylation by RIP3 (Fig. 3 E, comparelanes 4 and 5), indicating that RIP phosphorylation by RIP3 is dependent on the formation of a RIP·RIP3 complex. We have previously shown that RIP3 attenuates RIP- and TNFR1-mediated NF-κB activation (22Sun X. Lee J. Navas T. Baldwin D.T. Stewart T.A. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16871-16875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To determine whether the kinase and homotypic interaction motifs of RIP3 are required to attenuate RIP-mediated NF-κB activation, HEK293E cells expressing TNFR1 and RIP, but not RIP3 (data not shown), were transfected with wild-type and mutant RIP3, and NF-κB activation was assessed following TNF treatment. Cells expressing wild-type RIP3 showed markedly reduced NF-κB activity upon TNF treatment. Mutant RIP3 containing a disrupted RHIM did not inhibit NF-κB activation (Fig.4 B), indicating that the ability of RIP3 to inhibit TNF-induced NF-κB activation is dependent on its homotypic interaction with RIP. To confirm this finding, we used a RIP-deficient Jurkat cell line in which TNF-induced NF-κB activity is rescued by RIP (6Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant RIPs with a disrupted RHIM were able to stimulate NF-κB activation equally well in these cells. However, although the ability of wild-type RIP to stimulate NF-κB activation was attenuated by RIP3, NF-κB activation by a RIP mutant with a disrupted RHIM was not inhibited by RIP3. Disruption of the RHIM in RIP3 also prevented inhibition of RIP-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, an intact RHIM in both molecules is required for RIP3 to inhibit RIP-mediated NF-κB activation. Like the RIP3 RHIM mutant, a kinase-dead RIP3 mutant did not inhibit NF-κB activation by RIP (Fig. 4 D). This result suggests that phosphorylation of RIP by RIP3 inhibits its ability to activate NF-κB. The kinetics of attenuation of TNF-induced NF-κB activation by RIP3 were analyzed over a 24-h period (Fig. 4 E). In the presence of transfected wild-type RIP3, NF-κB activation in response to TNF was rapidly extinguished; however, RHIM-deficient mutant RIP3 did not influence NF-κB activation (Fig. 4 E). We propose that when cells are exposed to TNF, RIP is recruited to the TNFR1 signaling complex to activate NF-κB. Subsequent recruitment of RIP3 through a RHIM-mediated interaction leads to phosphorylation of RIP by RIP3, and this inhibits the ability of RIP to further engage the NF-κB pathway. Such a desensitization mechanism would limit persistent activation of the NF-κB pathway.

We determined whether mice lacking PPARα (PPARα (−/−) mice) have alterations in cardiac energy metabolism. Rates of palmitate oxidation were significantly decreased in isolated working hearts from PPARα (−/−) hearts compared with hearts from age-matched wild type mice (PPARα (+/+) mice), (62 ± 12versus 154 ± 65 nmol/g dry weight/min, respectively,p < 0.05). This was compensated for by significant increases in the rates of glucose oxidation and glycolysis. The decreased fatty acid oxidation in PPARα (−/−) hearts was associated with increased levels of cardiac malonyl-CoA compared with PPARα (+/+) hearts (15.15 ± 1.63 versus 7.37 ± 1.31 nmol/g, dry weight, respectively, p < 0.05). Since malonyl-CoA is an important regulator of cardiac fatty acid oxidation, we also determined if the enzymes that control malonyl-CoA levels in the heart are under transcriptional control of PPARα. Expression of both mRNA and protein as well as the activity of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, which degrades malonyl-CoA, were significantly decreased in the PPARα (−/−) hearts. In contrast, the expression and activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which synthesizes malonyl-CoA and 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase, which regulates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, were not altered. Glucose transporter expression (GLUT1 and GLUT4) was not different between PPARα (−/−) and PPARα (+/+) hearts, suggesting that the increase in glycolysis and glucose oxidation in the PPARα null mice was not due to direct effects on glucose uptake but rather was occurring secondary to the decrease in fatty acid oxidation. This study demonstrates that PPARα is an important regulator of fatty acid oxidation in the heart and that this regulation of fatty acid oxidation may in part occur due to the transcriptional control of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase.

Fatty acid oxidation is an important source of energy in the heart and normally provides the majority of ATP necessary to sustain contractile function (11Lopaschuk G.D. Belke D.D. Gamble J. Itoi I. Schonekess B.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 12Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In many pathological states, fatty acid oxidation can dramatically increase, providing almost all of the energy requirements of the heart (reviewed in Ref. 11Lopaschuk G.D. Belke D.D. Gamble J. Itoi I. Schonekess B.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). For instance, in uncontrolled diabetes, fatty acid oxidation can account for almost 100% of the heart's energy production (13Wall S.R. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Sakamoto J. Barr R.L. Kavanagh K.M. Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1196-H11204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This unfortunately occurs at the expense of glucose metabolism, which contributes to both the development of contractile dysfunction and an increased sensitivity of the heart to injury during an ischemic insult (for a review, see Ref. 15Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: 11A-16AAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). High rates of cardiac fatty acid oxidation are also seen in the fasting state (16Neely J.R. Morgan H.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1974; 36: 413-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Increased expression of cardiac PPARα and activities of PPARα-controlled genes in hearts from diabetic (17Kurtz D.M. Tian L. Gower B.A. Nagy T.R. Pinkert C.A. Wood P. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or fasted (18Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin.

A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) animals have been implicated in these high rates of fatty acid oxidation. However, a direct relationship between PPARα and fatty acid oxidation rates in the intact heart has not been established. An important regulator of cardiac fatty acid oxidation is malonyl-CoA, which inhibits fatty acid uptake into mitochondria due to a potent inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (20McGarry J.D. Leatherman G.F. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decreasing malonyl-CoA levels are accompanied by significant increases in fatty acid oxidation; conversely, increases in malonyl-CoA can result in substantial decreases in fatty acid oxidation (21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the importance of malonyl-CoA in regulating fatty acid oxidation, the role of PPARα in regulating the expression and activity of the enzymes involved in controlling malonyl-CoA levels has received little attention. Malonyl-CoA is synthesized in the heart by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is degraded by malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) (22Dyck J.R.B. Barr A.J. Barr R.L. Kolattukudy P.E. Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H2122-H2129PubMed Google Scholar). ACC is in turn regulated by 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key fuel-sensing kinase that can phosphorylate and inhibit ACC (23Hardie D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1301: 231-238Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also suggests that in skeletal muscle AMPK can phosphorylate and activate MCD (24Saha A.K. Schwarsin A.J. Roduit R.

A recent study has shown that treatment of rats with a PPARα agonist, Wy-14643, increases MCD mRNA expression in the heart, although the effects of this treatment on malonyl-CoA levels and fatty acid oxidation rates have not been determined (25Young M.E. Goodwin G.W. Ying J. Guthrie P. Wilson C.R. Laws F.A. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E471-E479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose metabolism in the heart consists of two main pathways, glycolysis and glucose oxidation. Although activators of PPARα improve insulin sensitivity and hyperglycemia in rodent models of insulin resistance (26Guerre-Millo M. Gervois P. Raspe E. Madsen L. Poulain P. Derudas B. Herbert J-M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9149-9157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is unclear if this is a direct effect on glucose metabolism or whether this occurs indirectly through the effects of PPARα activation on fatty acid oxidation. Long-chain fatty acids, which are activators of PPARα, have been shown to decrease mRNA levels of GLUT4 level in vitro (28Long S.D. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1138-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Whether this effect is mediated by PPARα remains to be determined. The availability of mice that lack PPARα provides a useful model to examine the role of PPARα in the regulation of fatty acid and glucose metabolism in the heart. Several studies have shown that hearts from PPARα (−/−) mice show decreased expression of a number of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation including MCAD (6Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Itritani N.

This is associated with decreased rates of fatty acid oxidation in isolated cardiac myocytes from these animals (30Watanabe K. Fujii H. Takahashi T. Kodama M. Aizawa Y. Ohta Y. Ono T. Hasegawa G.

However, direct determination of metabolism in the intact hearts of these animals is lacking. We recently developed an isolated working mouse heart model that allows us to directly measure energy metabolism in the intact heart under conditions of physiologically relevant levels of metabolic demand (31Belke D.D. Larsen T.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R1210-R1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,32Larsen T.S. Belke D.D. Sas R. Giles W.R. Severson D.L. Lopaschuk G.D. Tyberg J.V. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to use this experimental model to determine what effects PPARα has on fatty acid and glucose metabolism in the heart. We also sought to determine whether concentrations of malonyl-CoA were altered in these hearts and whether PPARα mediated control of fatty acid oxidation involves transcriptional regulation of the key genes involved in the control of malonyl-CoA levels. PPARα (−/−) mice from a Sv/129 genetic background were produced as described (19Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 29Djoudi F. Weinheimer C.J. Saffiz J.E. Pitchford C. Bastin J. Gonzalez F.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). Wild type Sv/129 mice (PPARα (+/+) mice) were used as controls. Mouse working heart perfusions were carried out using the methods and apparatus previously described (31Belke D.D. Larsen T.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R1210-R1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Larsen T.S. Belke D.D. Sas R. Giles W.R. Severson D.L. Lopaschuk G.D. Tyberg J.V. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Adult PPARα (−/−) and PPARα (+/+) controls between 25 and 40 g in body weight were heparinized (100 units intraperitoneal) 10 min prior to anesthesia with 10 mg of intraperitoneal Na+ pentobarbitol. Hearts were then excised and placed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate solution (118 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm glucose, gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 (pH 7.4)). Hearts were then cannulated as working hearts and perfused at a 7-mm Hg left atrial preload and 50-mm Hg aortic afterload with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 5 mm glucose, 0.4 mmpalmitate prebound to 3% bovine serum albumin, and 100 microunits/ml insulin. Glucose and palmitate were appropriately radiolabeled for energy metabolic measurements, as described below. Spontaneously beating hearts were perfused for a 30-min aerobic period, and heart rate pressure measurements were recorded using a pressure transducer (Harvard Apparatus). Data were collected using an MP100 system from AcqKnowledge (BIOPAC Systems, Inc.). Cardiac output and aortic flows were obtained by monitoring the flow into the left atria and from the afterload line using Transonic flow probes, respectively. Coronary flow was calculated from the difference of the cardiac output and aortic flows. Cardiac work was calculated as the product of peak systolic pressure and cardiac output. At the end of the 30-min perfusion, the ventricle from the heart was frozen immediately in liquid N2, and the mass was recorded. Hearts were then ground using a mortar and pestle cooled to the temperature of liquid N2. A portion of this powdered tissue (∼20 mg) was weighed (wet weight) and then dried at 60 °C overnight to remove all water (dry weight). The ratio of this sample (dry/wet weight) was used to calculate the total dry mass of the heart. Metabolic rates were calculated using total dry mass of the heart to correct for variations in heart size. Metabolism of glucose and palmitate in PPARα (−/−) and PPARα (+/+) mouse hearts was measured according to the methods outlined by Saddik and Lopaschuk (12Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All determinations of substrate metabolism were made in duplicate. Rates of glucose oxidation, glycolysis, and palmitate oxidation were measured in separate series of hearts. Steady state metabolic rates were calculated as the mean values when perfusate samples were removed from the working heart apparatus. Values obtained for the metabolic pathways were normalized for heart mass (dry weight). Glucose oxidation rates were determined by trapping and measuring 14CO2 released by the metabolism of [U-14C]glucose. Collection of14CO2 released during glucose oxidation was performed as described previously (31Belke D.D. Larsen T.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R1210-R1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycolytic flux was determined as previously described (31Belke D.D. Larsen T.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R1210-R1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by measuring the amount of3H2O released from the metabolism of [5-3H]glucose by the triosephosphate isomerase and enolase steps of the glycolytic pathway (12Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Palmitate oxidation rates were measured by quantitatively collecting14CO2 produced from hearts perfused with [1-14C] palmitate as described previously (12Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Belke D.D. Larsen T.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R1210-R1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detection and quantification of CoA esters were performed by extracting CoA esters from powdered tissue into 6% perchloric acid and measuring with a modified high pressure liquid chromatography procedure, as described previously (34Lopaschuk G.D. Witters L.A. Itoi T. Barr R. Barr A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25871-25878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MCD activity was measured in extracts isolated from mouse heart tissue as described previously (22Dyck J.R.B. Barr A.J. Barr R.L. Kolattukudy P.E. Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H2122-H2129PubMed Google Scholar). To measure AMPK and ACC activity, powdered heart tissue was homogenized in 0.05 m Tris, 0.25m mannitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, with the addition of Sigma protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cells. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g, and the supernatant was used to perform the ACC and AMPK assays as described previously (34Lopaschuk G.D. Witters L.A. Itoi T. Barr R. Barr A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25871-25878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Salt I. Celler J.W. Hawley S.A. Prescott A. Woods A. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Protein expression of MCD, ACC, the α1 and α2 subunits of AMPK, GLUT1, and GLUT4 were measured by Western blot analysis. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose as described (34Lopaschuk G.D. Witters L.A. Itoi T. Barr R. Barr A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25871-25878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were immunoblotted with polyclonal antibodies raised to rat liver MCD (36Dyck J.R.B. Berthiaume L.G. Panakkezhum T.D. Kantor P.F. Barr A.J. Barr R. Singh D. Hopkins T.A. Voilley N. Prentki M. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to the α1 and α2subunits of AMPK were a gift from Dr. David Carling (Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom). GLUT1 and GLUT4 polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Chemicon International, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavadin was used for detection of ACC as described (34Lopaschuk G.D. Witters L.A. Itoi T. Barr R. Barr A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25871-25878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were then developed using the Amersham Biosciences, Inc. enhanced chemiluminesence Western blotting detection system. The expression of MCD mRNA was determined by Northern blotting. RNA was extracted from mouse heart tissue with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was then subjected to Northern blotting. A probe corresponding to nucleotides 676–1073 of the rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase coding sequence was prepared by RT-PCR of mouse heart RNA using a Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit and the specific primers, 5′-AGAACATCATCATCCCTGATCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGT (reverse). A 308-base pair probe to mouse MCD (accession number NM019966) was prepared by RT-PCR of mouse heart RNA using primers 5′-GCAGAATGGGGCTGTGATAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTTCTAAGAAGGGGCCCAAG-3′ (reverse). Labeling and detection was carried out using the North2South® Direct HRP Labeling and Detection kit from Pierce, as described in the kit protocol. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between two group means were performed using the Student's t test. Where appropriate, analysis of variance followed by the Neuman-Keuls test was used to determine statistical significance when more than two group means were involved. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Various parameters of heart function in the PPARα (−/−) and PPARα (+/+) mouse hearts perfused at a 7-mm Hg preload and 50-mm Hg afterload are shown in TableI. Heart function throughout the 30-min perfusion period was stable in all hearts (data not shown). Under the perfusion conditions used, there was no difference in function between the PPARα (−/−) mouse hearts and the PPARα (+/+) mouse hearts. As a result, any differences in metabolism between these two groups could not be explained by differences in contractile function.Table IParameters of cardiac functionPerfusion conditionPPARα (+/+) (n = 15)PPARα (−/−) (n = 16)Heart rate (beats/min)245 ± 17280 ± 16Peak systolic pressure (mm Hg)69 ± 272 ± 3Coronary flow (ml/min)3.7 ± 0.62.7 ± 0.6Cardiac output (ml/min)6.8 ± 0.65.7 ± 0.5Cardiac work (ml · mm Hg/min · 102)4.6 ± 0.54.1 ± 0.4Functional parameters were measured in isolated working hearts from PPARα (−/−) and wild type (+/+) controls perfused in 7-mm Hg preload and 50-mm Hg afterload for 30 min. Open table in a new tab Functional parameters were measured in isolated working hearts from PPARα (−/−) and wild type (+/+) controls perfused in 7-mm Hg preload and 50-mm Hg afterload for 30 min. Steady state rates of palmitate oxidation, glycolysis, and glucose oxidation in PPARα (−/−) and PPARα (+/+) hearts are shown in Fig.1. Rates of palmitate oxidation, glycolysis, and glucose oxidation were linear in all hearts throughout the perfusion period (data not shown). Palmitate oxidation in PPARα (−/−) hearts was significantly lower than in PPARα (+/+) hearts. This decrease in palmitate oxidation was accompanied by a significant increase in both glucose oxidation and glycolysis. The contribution of both palmitate oxidation and glucose oxidation to tricarboxylic acid cycle acetyl-CoA production is shown in Fig.2. In PPARα (+/+) hearts, 58.5% of the tricarboxylic acid cycle acetyl-CoA was derived from glucose oxidation, whereas 41.5% originated from palmitate oxidation. These values are similar to our previously published values in mouse hearts perfused under these conditions (31Belke D.D. Larsen T.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R1210-R1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overall tricarboxylic acid cycle activity did not differ between the PPARα (−/−) and PPARα (+/+) hearts. However, the contribution of palmitate oxidation to tricarboxylic acid cycle activity in PPARα (−/−) hearts was markedly reduced compared with (+/+) hearts. This decrease was compensated by an increased production of acetyl-CoA from glucose oxidation. Glycolytic rates were also significantly increased in PPARα (−/−) hearts relative to PPARα (+/+) hearts. Malonyl-CoA levels in tissue from PPARα (−/−) and PPARα (+/+) hearts frozen following perfusion are shown in Fig.3. Malonyl-CoA levels were significantly higher in the PPARα (−/−) hearts compared with the PPARα (+/+) hearts. In contrast, there was no difference between the two groups in the levels of other CoA esters measured. Acetyl-CoA levels were 12.18 ± 3.51 and 9.40 ± 2.73 nmol/g dry weight, in PPARα (−/−) and PPARα (+/+), respectively (p not significant). Free CoA, acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and glutathione CoA levels were also not different between these two groups (data not shown). To determine the mechanism responsible for the increase in malonyl-CoA levels in the PPARα (−/−) hearts, we measured the expression and activity of enzymes known to regulate malonyl-CoA levels in the heart (ACC, AMPK, and MCD). In PPARα (−/−) hearts, a significant decrease in both MCD protein levels (Fig.4A) and activity (Fig.5A) was observed compared with PPARα (+/+) hearts. MCD mRNA levels in PPARα (−/−) were also significantly reduced compared with PPARα (+/+) hearts (Fig.6). In contrast, there was no difference in the protein expression (Fig. 4B) or activity (Fig.5B) of ACC between hearts from the two groups. The relative expression of the two isoforms of ACC in wild type and PPARα (−/−) null hearts was similar (the ratio of protein expression of ACC II compared with ACC I was 1.69 ± 0.61 and 1.66 ± 0.76, respectively, n = 4; values ± S.E.). Protein levels of both the α1 and α2 catalytic subunits of AMPK were also not different in the PPARα (−/−) and PPARα (+/+) hearts (Fig. 4C). Similarly, no difference in AMPK activity was observed between these two groups of hearts (Fig.5C).Figure 5Activities of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (A), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (B), and the α1 and α2 catalytic subunits of AMP-activated protein kinase (C) in PPARα (−/−) andPPARα (+/+) mouse hearts.

No differences in GLUT1 and GLUT4 expression were observed between these two groups. It has been well documented that PPARα controls the expression of genes important for fatty acid oxidation (3Gulick T. Cresci S. Caira T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, we demonstrate that a deficiency of PPARα results in a dramatic decrease in fatty acid oxidation in the intact working heart. Our results also suggest that PPARα regulates malonyl-CoA levels in the heart. In hearts from PPARα (−/−) mice, malonyl-CoA levels were elevated, thereby contributing to the low palmitate oxidation rates observed in these hearts. This increase in malonyl-CoA is not due to an increase in ACC expression or activity or to alterations in AMPK control of ACC activity. However, the increase in malonyl-CoA levels can be explained by the decreased expression and activity of MCD in the hearts of mice lacking PPARα, suggesting that MCD is under the transcriptional control of PPARα.

Malonyl-CoA levels in the heart rapidly change in response to changes in metabolic demand (21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Goodwin G.W. Taylor C.S. Taegtmeyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29530-29539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For instance, if glucose supply and oxidation rates are high, malonyl-CoA levels increase, resulting in a decrease in fatty acid oxidation rates (21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in the absence of glucose, malonyl-CoA levels decrease, and fatty acid oxidation rates increase (21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA levels also decrease in the presence of increased metabolic demand that occurs during increases in cardiac work (39Goodwin G.W. Taylor C.S. Taegtmeyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29530-29539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In the PPARα (−/−) hearts, a number of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation decrease, which probably contributes to the low fatty acid oxidation rates observed in these hearts. In these hearts, there are three possible scenarios as to how malonyl-CoA levels are controlled. The first scenario is that malonyl-CoA levels are not under PPARα control and that malonyl-CoA decreases in the PPARα (−/−) hearts to compensate for the decrease in fatty acid oxidation. The second scenario is that malonyl-CoA levels are not under PPARα control, but malonyl-CoA levels increase secondary to the increase in glucose oxidation (which we have shown increases malonyl-CoA levels (21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The third scenario is that like other fatty acid oxidation enzymes, PPARα also controls the enzymes involved in regulating malonyl-CoA levels and that malonyl-CoA levels would increase in the PPARα (−/−) hearts. The first scenario is unlikely since malonyl-CoA levels increased rather then decreased in the PPARα (−/−) hearts. The second scenario is also unlikely, since glucose oxidation increases malonyl-CoA by increasing the supply of acetyl-CoA available for malonyl-CoA synthesis by ACC (21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In PPARα (−/−) hearts, the increase in glucose oxidation was not accompanied by an increase in acetyl-CoA levels, suggesting that the observed increase in glucose oxidation is not responsible for the increase in malonyl-CoA levels. Our data support the third scenario and suggest that malonyl-CoA levels in the heart are under PPARα control. We also demonstrate that PPARα may control MCD expression/activity. This is supported by the recent observation that feeding rats the PPARα ligand Wy-14643 results in an increase in heart mRNA levels for MCD (25Young M.E. Goodwin G.W. Ying J. Guthrie P. Wilson C.R. Laws F.A. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E471-E479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike MCD, neither ACC expression nor activity was altered in the PPARα (−/−) hearts. Similarly, neither AMPK expression nor activity was different between PPARα (−/−) and PPARα (+/+) hearts. These data do not support a role for PPARα regulating either ACC or AMPK expression/activity in the heart. However, it cannot be ruled out that stimulating PPARα or overexpressing PPARα may alter the expression or activity of either ACC or AMPK. This possibility is presently being explored. The decreased rate of fatty acid oxidation in PPARα (−/−) mice was compensated by an increase in glucose oxidation rates such that cardiac function is unchanged in these hearts. The observation that overall tricarboxylic acid cycle activity did not change in the PPARα (−/−) hearts despite a dramatic decrease in fatty acid oxidation suggests that glucose oxidation increased in response to the decrease in fatty acid oxidation. The increase in glycolysis also probably occurred because of the decrease in fatty acid oxidation rates. However, direct effects of PPARα on glucose metabolism cannot be ruled out. To determine whether PPARα has any direct effects on glucose transport, GLUT1 and GLUT4 levels were measured in the PPARα (−/−) and PPARα (+/+) hearts. The lack of effect on glucose transporter expression suggests that PPARα effects on glucose metabolism were not direct but rather were through alterations in fatty acid oxidation. Even if PPARα were to alter glucose transporter content, this could not explain the increase in glucose oxidation observed in this PPARα (−/−) hearts, since studies with perfused mouse hearts overexpressing GLUT4 showed increased rates of glycolysis but not of glucose oxidation (40Belke D.D. Larsen T.S Gibbs E.M. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E420-E427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, the increase in glucose oxidation (and probably glycolysis) in the PPARα (−/−) hearts was most likely occurring secondary to the decrease in fatty acid oxidation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that knocking out PPARα alters fatty acid oxidation in the heart, indicating the role that this nuclear receptor plays in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. In addition to directly controlling a number of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, we show that PPARα may also control fatty acid oxidation by altering malonyl-CoA levels, secondary to controlling MCD expression and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2039263971,"The potassium channels in the two-pore domain family are widely expressed and regulate the excitability of neurons and other excitable cells. These channels have been shown to function as dimers, but heteromerization between the various channel subunits has not yet been reported. Here we demonstrate that two members of the TASK subfamily of potassium channels, TASK-1 and TASK-3, can form functional heterodimers when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. To recognize the two TASK channel types, we took advantage of the higher sensitivity of TASK-1 over TASK-3 to physiological pH changes and the discriminating sensitivity of TASK-3 to the cationic dye ruthenium red. These features were clearly observed when the channels were expressed individually. However, when TASK-1 and TASK-3 were expressed together, the resulting current showed intermediate pH sensitivity and ruthenium red insensitivity (characteristic of TASK-1), indicating the formation of TASK-1/TASK-3 heterodimers. Expression of a tandem construct in which TASK-3 and TASK-1 were linked together yielded currents with features very similar to those observed when coexpressing the two channels. The tandem construct also responded to AT1a angiotensin II receptor stimulation with an inhibition that was weaker than the inhibition of homodimeric TASK-1 and greater than that shown by TASK-3. Expression of epitope-tagged channels in mammalian cells showed their primary presence in the plasma membrane consistent with their function in this location.

Expression of a tandem construct in which TASK-3 and TASK-1 were linked together yielded currents with features very similar to those observed when coexpressing the two channels. The tandem construct also responded to AT1a angiotensin II receptor stimulation with an inhibition that was weaker than the inhibition of homodimeric TASK-1 and greater than that shown by TASK-3. Expression of epitope-tagged channels in mammalian cells showed their primary presence in the plasma membrane consistent with their function in this location. Heteromerization of two-pore domain potassium channels may provide a greater functional diversity and additional means by which they can be regulated in their native tissues. Potassium channels play a pivotal role in adjusting the excitability of neurons and endocrine cells by controlling the resting membrane potential. Two large families of K+ channels have been identified so far that can drive the resting membrane potential (E m) toward hyperpolarization. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels conduct considerable currents around the K+ equilibrium potential, but their outward current diminishes upon depolarization. Therefore, these channels stabilize the resting E m without markedly influencing depolarizing membrane potential changes. In contrast, members of the two-pore domain (2P) 1The abbreviations used are:2Ptwo-pore domainECextracellularMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidHAhemagglutininFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineRRruthenium red potassium channels provide substantial currents not only at the restingE m but also in the depolarized state. Moreover, the repolarizing current of 2P potassium channels is maintained at a given potential, because they activate instantaneously and, with the exception of TWIK-2 (1Chavez R.A. Gray A.T.

Therefore, in addition to controlling the resting E m, 2P potassium channels are also involved in the regulation of action potential duration and firing patterns in neurons (2Millar J.A. Barratt L.

Each subunit contains four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains: one located between the first and second transmembrane segments and another between the third and fourth transmembrane segments. This topology assumes that both the N and C termini of the subunits are intracellular. The selectivity filter of K+ channels being made up of four pore domains is the reason for the requirement to form dimers. In addition to these theoretical considerations, dimer formation of 2P channel subunits has been also demonstrated experimentally (8Lesage F. Lauritzen I. Duprat F. Reyes R. Fink M. Heurteaux C.

The cloned mammalian 2P channels have been classified into five subfamilies based on their primary sequences and electrophysiological and regulatory properties. The TWIK (tandem of pore domains in a weakly inwardly rectifyingK+ channel) subfamily contains TWIK-1 (11Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J.

Recent studies indicated that stimulation of certain G protein-coupled receptors inhibits TASK-1 channels (2Millar J.A. Barratt L. Southan A.P. Page K.M. Fyffe R.E. Robertson B. Mathie A. Proc. Natl.

Physiol. 2001; 281: C700-C708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all of the above-mentioned studies, 2P channels were expressed as homodimers (for review see Ref. 27Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also demonstrated that both the P1 and the P2 domains of KCNK3 (TASK-1) contribute to the pore within the homodimer (10Lopes C.M. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol.

However, these studies concluded that neither THIKs nor these KCNKs can form heterodimers, because the THIK-1 current was not influenced by overexpression of the nonfunctional THIK-2, and coexpression of KCNK6 and KCNK7 did not yield a functional K+ channel (2Millar J.A.

In the present report we demonstrate for the first time that two members of the TASK subfamily, TASK-1 and TASK-3, are capable of constituting functional heterodimers when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The pharmacological and regulatory properties of the TASK-1/TASK-3 heterodimer is clearly different from those of each of the homodimers, adding to the diversity of potassium channels that affect the function of excitable cells. Enzymes and kits of molecular biology applications were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX), Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania), New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and Promega (Madison, WI). All other chemicals of analytical grade were obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), Promega, and Sigma. The coding region of TASK-3 was amplified from total RNA prepared from rat adrenal zona glomerulosa usingPfu turbo DNA polymerase after reverse transcription. PCR primers were designed on the basis of the published rat TASK-3 sequence. The forward primer was 5′-ggcatATGAAGCGGCAGAATGTGCG-3′ (T3-s), and the reverse primer (T3end-a) was 5′-cctctctagACTTAGATGGACTTGCGACG-3′. The additional bases at the 5′ ends (indicated by lowercase letters) introduced NdeI andXbaI restriction sites to the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and cloned into the XbaI-EcoRV-digested Bluescript pKS phagemid (Stratagene). This construct was then subcloned into the pEXO vector containing the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of theXenopus globin gene. The sequence of the construct (pEXO-TASK-3) was determined from both directions by automated sequencing. Partially overlapping sense (T(3+1)LIGs: 5′-GTCCATCAAGCGGCAGAACGTGCGC-3′) and antisense (T(3+1)LIGa: 5′-CTGCCGCTTGATGGACTTGCGACGGATG-3′) oligonucleotides were designed for linking the coding sequences of TASK-3 and TASK-1. The sequence of the oligonucleotides covered the C-terminal end of the TASK-3 and the N-terminal beginning of the TASK-1 coding sequences in frame. PCR products were amplified (15 cycles) from pEXO-TASK-3 with the sense T3forw (corresponding to bases 268–290 of TASK-3) and the antisense T(3+1)LIGa primers. PCR was also performed from pEXO-TASK-1 with the sense T(3+1)LIGs and the antisense T1rev (corresponding to bases 611–631 of TASK-1). The two PCR products were then mixed, allowed to hybridize by their overlapping T(3+1)LIGs and T(3+1)LIGa primer regions, and elongated without primers. This was followed by further amplification (15 cycles) in the presence of T3forw and T1rev primers. The resulting T3forw-T1rev product was digested with Kpn2I (which cuts within the TASK-3 half of the sequence) and was ligated into the Kpn2I-SmaI digested pEXO-TASK-3. (SmaI creates a blunt end at the multiple cloning site of pEXO at the 3′ end of the TASK-3 insert). To add the missing piece of TASK-1 to this construct, the NcoI-BamHI fragment of the resulting clone was replaced with theNcoI-BamHI fragment of pEXO-TASK-1. (TheNcoI site is within the TASK-1 part of the T3forw-T1rev amplification product, and BamHI is in the pEXO cloning site downstream of the SmaI site.) The region of the two channels originating from the PCR amplification was verified by sequencing. The pEXO-TASK-(3+1) construct coded for a polypeptide chain, in which the last amino acid residue (Ile) of TASK-3 is followed by the second residue of TASK-1 (Lys). TASK-1, TASK-3, TASK-(3+1), TRAAK, TREK-1 and the angiotensin II (AT1a) receptor cRNA were synthesized in vitro according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINETM T7 in vitro transcription kit) using the XbaI linearized pEXO-TASK-1 (21Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), pEXO-TASK-3, pEXO-TASK-(3+1), pEXO-TRAAK (28Maingret F. Fosset M.

E. Bernstein). Mature female X. laevis frogs were obtained from Amrep Reptielen (Breda, Netherlands). The frogs were anesthetized by immersion into benzocaine solution (0.03%). Ovarian lobes were removed, and the tissue was dissected and treated with collagenase (1.45 mg/ml, 148 units/mg, type I; Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) and continuous mechanical agitation in Ca2+-free OR2 solution containing 82,5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for 1.5–2 h. Stage V and VI oocytes were defolliculated manually and kept at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline containing 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 20 mm HEPES buffered to pH 7.5 with NaOH and supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), sodium pyruvate (4.5 mm), and theophyllin (0.5 mm). The oocytes were injected 1 day after defolliculation. Fifty nanoliters of the appropriate RNA solution was delivered with Nanoliter Injector (World Precision Instruments, Saratosa, FL). Electrophysiological experiments were performed 3 or 4 days after the injection. Membrane currents were recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp (OC-725-C; Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) using microelectrodes made of borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, UK) with a resistance of 0.3–1 MΩ when filled with 3 m KCl. The currents were filtered at 1 kHz, digitally sampled at 1–2.5 kHz with a Digidata Interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and stored on a PC/AT computer. Recording and data analysis were performed using pCLAMP software 6.0.4 (Axon Instruments). The experiments were carried out at room temperature, and the solutions were applied by a gravity-driven perfusion system. Low [K+] solution contained 95.4 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 5 mm HEPES. High [K+] solution contained 80 mm K+ (78 mmNa+ of the low [K+] solution was replaced with K+). Unless otherwise stated, the pH of every solution was adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH. Perifusing solutions with a pH of <6.5 were buffered by including 5 mm MES. Background K+ currents were measured in high EC [K+] at the end of 300-ms-long voltage steps to −100 mV applied in every 3 s. The holding potential was 0 mV. Where possible, the inward current in high [K+] was corrected for the small nonspecific leak measured in 2 mm EC [K+]. Oligonucleotide dimers coding for themyc (residues 410–419 of human c-myc, EQKLISEEDL) and HA (residues 99–107 of human influenza virus hemagglutinin, YPYDVPDYA) epitopes were ligated in the uniqueNruI and Kpn2I restriction enzyme sites of pEXO-TASK-1 and pEXO-TASK-3, respectively. Hybridization of the sensemyc oligonucleotide (5′-GAGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCAGAGGAGGACCTG-3′) with its reverse complement created blunt ends, whereas the sense (5′-CCGGGCTACCCTTACGACGTCCCTGACTACGCC-3′) and antisense (5′-CCGGGGCGTAGTCAGGGACGTCGTAAGGGTAGC-3′) HA oligonucleotides were designed to form overhanging Kpn2I-compatible ends in the appropriate reading frame. Correct insertion of the epitope coding regions was checked by sequencing. The epitope-tagged coding sequences were subcloned also into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells. For immunocytochemistry HEK cells were grown on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and were transfected for 6 h with TASK-1-HA-pcDNA3 or TASK-3-HA-pcDNA3 constructs (1 μg) in 1.2 ml of Opti-MEM containing 2 μl of LipofectAMINE. Two days after the transfection the cells were fixed in 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and washed three times with PBS containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (PBS-FBS). The cells were then incubated for 1 h with monoclonal anti-HA epitope antibody (Covance PRB 150C, 1:1000 dilution) in the presence of 0.2% saponin in PBS-FBS, followed by three 5-min washes before incubation for 1 h with Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-mouse IgG for TASK-1 and with Alexa Fluor-594 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for TASK-3 (each at 1:1000 dilution). For simultaneous detection of TASK-1 and TASK-3, the cells were cotransfected with TASK-1-myc-pcDNA3 and TASK-3-HA-pcDNA3 constructs (1 μg each, as above). During the immunostaining procedure and the incubation with the anti-HA epitope antibody and with the secondary Alexa Fluor 594 anti-mouse antibody (as above), the cells were washed and stained with a monoclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mycantibody (Covance FITC-150L, 1:50 dilution). After three final washes (each for 5 min in PBS-FBS), the coverslips were mounted for confocal microscopy. The cells were examined by an inverted Zeiss 410 laser confocal microscope with a (100×) oil immersion lens. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Normalized dose-response curves were fitted (least squares method; Sigmaplot, Jandel Corporation) to the following Hill equation: y = 1/(1 + (c/K 12)n), where c is the concentration, K 12 is the concentration at which half-maximal inhibition occurs, and n is the Hill coefficient. Where the treatment failed to cause complete inhibition, a modified form of the equation was used: y = ϕ/(1 + (c/K 12)n) + (1 − ϕ), where ϕ is the fraction maximally inhibited by the treatment. In a recent study we found that TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels can be distinguished by their different sensitivity to the polycationic compound, ruthenium red (RR). 2G. Czirják and P. Enyedi, (2002)Mol. Endocrinol., in press With the aim of applying RR as a potential tool discriminating between different members of the 2P domain potassium channel family, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of RR on TASK-1, on TASK-3, and also on TRAAK and TREK-1 channels in more detail. The current was monitored at −100 mV in the presence of 80 mm extracellular [K+], a condition that gives a large signal of the expressed channels with only minor contamination by other endogenous currents of the oocytes (4Czirják G. Fischer T. Spät A. Lesage F. Enyedi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 863-874PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, TASK-3 and TRAAK currents were greatly reduced by RR with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.7 and 2 μm, respectively. Interestingly, the inhibition of TRAAK followed a much steeper dose-response relationship than the inhibition of TASK-3. This was also reflected in the Hill coefficients calculated for the inhibitory curves. The Hill coefficient for TASK-3 channels was found to be 1.0, indicating the binding of one RR molecule to one functional channel (dimer). In contrast, TRAAK inhibition by RR showed a Hill coefficient of 2.1, suggesting multiple RR-binding sites. The inhibitory effect of RR on both channels was found to be voltage-independent (Fig.2), indicating that the RR-binding sites on TASK-3 and TRAAK lay outside the transmembrane electrical field; accordingly a direct interference of the inhibitor with the pore of the channel is very unlikely. The rapid onset of the inhibition (not shown) suggests that RR acts from the extracellular side of the channels.Figure 2TASK-3 and TRAAK inhibition by ruthenium red is not voltage-dependent. Current-voltage relationships of an oocyte expressing TASK-3 (A) or TRAAK (B) were plotted in 2 mm EC [K+] (▪) and in 80 mm EC [K+] without (●) or with 3 μm ruthenium red (○). The currents were recorded at the end of 300-ms voltage steps from −120 mV to +20 mV in 10-mV increments from a holding potential of 0 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast to the prominent inhibition of TASK-3 and TRAAK channels by RR, their close relatives, TASK-1 and TREK-1, respectively, were not inhibited by RR even at micromolar concentration (4.5 ± 1.2% inhibition of TASK-1 by 5 μm RR (n = 14) and less than 10% inhibition of TREK-1 by 20 μm(n = 5)). Based on these results, RR has been identified as an excellent tool to differentiate between the individual members within both the TASK and TREK family of potassium channels. As reported earlier, an additional feature discriminating between TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels is their sensitivity to extracellular acidification, TASK-1 (on the contrary to TASK-3) being highly sensitive to pH changes between 7.5 and 6.5 (21Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 22Leonoudakis D. Gray A.T. Winegar B.D. Kindler C.H. Harada M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9340-9347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).2 First, we investigated the behavior of TASK-1 and TRAAK channels expressed simultaneously inXenopus oocytes in different ratios. Given the differential pH and ruthenium red sensitivities of the channels, their characteristics could be best evaluated when the degrees of inhibition by acidification (a pH step from 7.5 to 6.5) and RR (5 μm) were plotted one against the other (Fig.3). The positions of the two populations of homodimers (when only one form of the channels is expressed) is clearly separated in the extreme ends of the plot. TASK-1 homodimers that are insensitive to RR but highly sensitive to pH changes appear in the lower right, whereas TRAAK homodimers that are practically insensitive to acidification but are strongly inhibited by RR in the upper left area of the graph. When the characteristics of the coexpressed channels was plotted in the same graph, their data points all fell on the straight lineconnecting the clear TASK-1 and TRAAK populations (Fig. 3). Depending on the ratios of the two channels, the points fell closer or farther from the respective ends representing the homodimers. Such distribution of channel behavior is expected if various amounts of the two kind of homodimer channels operate independently, and therefore these data did not indicate that TASK-1 and TRAAK channels would form heterodimers. Clearly different results were obtained when TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels were coexpressed in the oocytes. TASK-1 or TASK-3 channels expressed alone are also presented with two, clearly distinguishable set of data points. The 70.4 ± 1.9 and 4.5 ± 1.2% (n = 14) inhibition of TASK-1 by acidification and RR, respectively, contrasted with the 19.3 ± 1.9 and 77.6 ± 2.3% (n = 14) inhibition by the same manipulations of TASK-3 channels. However, after coexpressions of the two channels, all the data points fell under the line connecting the TASK-1 and TASK-3 values (Fig.4 A). This result cannot be explained by formation of various proportions of simple homodimers and indicates the presence of significant amounts of heterodimer channels with new inhibitor sensitivity profiles. It is difficult to deduce the true characteristics of the heterodimer channels in terms of their pH and RR sensitivities in the above experiments because of the simultaneous presence of homodimers. To overcome this difficulty, we created a tandem version of TASK-3 and TASK-1 channels by joining the coding regions of the two channels to form one continuous protein. In this construct the C terminus of TASK-3 was fused to the N terminus of TASK-1. Such a tandem construct was expected to highly favor the assembly of the channels as heterodimers. Expressing the tandem channel in the oocytes induced large currents (13.3 ± 2.5 μA, n = 17), comparable in amplitude to the currents of TASK-1 and TASK-3. However, the pH and RR sensitivity values of the tandem channel was clearly distinct from both parent channels. It showed significant inhibition (36.4 ± 2.5%, n = 9) in response to a pH step form 7.5 to 6.5 (an intermediate pH sensitivity between TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels) and minimal inhibition (4.5 ± 1.5%,n = 9) by 5 μm RR (a feature of TASK-1 channels) (Fig. 4 B). Remarkably, the data set given by the tandem channel showed an overlapping distribution with those obtained in the coexpression experiments confirming the formation of heterodimers in the latter (Fig. 4 A). The pH sensitivity of the tandem channel was compared with that of TASK-1 and TASK-3 hom"

TP activities in buffy coats were reduced drastically in all 27 MNGIE patients compared with 19 controls. All MNGIE patients had much higher plasma levels of thymidine than normal individuals and asymptomatic TP mutation carriers. In two patients, the renal clearance of thymidine was ∼20% that of creatinine, and because hemodialysis demonstrated that thymidine is ultrafiltratable, most of the filtered thymidine is likely to be reabsorbed by the kidney. In vitro, fibroblasts from controls catabolized thymidine in medium; by contrast, MNGIE fibroblasts released thymidine. In MNGIE, severe impairment of TP enzyme activity leads to increased plasma thymidine. In patients who are suspected of having MNGIE, determination of TP activity in buffy coats and thymidine levels in plasma are diagnostic.

Bonilla E. Davidson M. Hirano M. Schon E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Because subunits of the electron transport chain are the products of two genomes, nDNA and mtDNA, mitochondrial encephalomyopathies can be caused by defects in either genome or in cross-talk between the genomes that regulate mtDNA integrity and quantity. For more than a decade, investigators have focused primarily upon mtDNA and have identified more than 100 distinct point mutations as well as large scale molecular rearrangement (2Servidei S. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2001; 11: 230-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since 1995, a growing number of nDNA mutations have been identified as causes of respiratory chain monoenzymopathies (3Bourgeron T. Rustin P. Chretien D. Birch-Machin M. Bourgeois M.

By contrast, mutations in nDNA causing defects of intergenomic signals, mtDNA depletion or multiple deletions, are just beginning to be defined.

Clinically, MNGIE presents between the 1st and the 5th decades with ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, or both; skeletal myopathy; peripheral neuropathy; gastrointestinal dysmotility, manifesting as diarrhea and pseudo-obstruction; and cachexia (7Nishino I.

Clinical diagnostic tests typically reveal leukodystrophy on brain magnetic resonance imaging scans, lactic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy with demyelination, axonal degeneration, or both. Skeletal muscle biopsies show neurogenic changes together with mitochondrial abnormalities such as ragged red fibers, ultrastructurally abnormal mitochondria, and decreased cytochromec oxidase activity, either in isolation or in association with multiple respiratory chain enzyme defects. We identified mutations in the thymidine phosphorylase (TP) gene, located on chromosome 22q13.32-qter, as the cause of MNGIE (8Hirano M. Yebenes J. Jones A.C. Nishino I. DiMauro S. Carlo J.R.

We report enzymatic TP activity and plasma thymidine levels from MNGIE patients and urine thymidine excretion in two patients studied at our center. We studied 27 probands with MNGIE, 29 asymptomatic relatives, and 23 normal controls. The clinical diagnosis of MNGIE required the presence of six features as follows: 1) severe gastrointestinal dysmotility; 2) cachexia; 3) ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, or both; 4) peripheral neuropathy; 5) leukodystrophy on brain magnetic resonance imaging scan; and 6) laboratory evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. As reported previously, we identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the TP gene in all 27 probands and heterozygous mutations in 22 relatives (7Nishino I. Spinazzola A. Papadimitriou A. Hammans S. Steiner I. Hahn C.D. Connolly A.M. Verloes A. Guimarães J. Maillard I. Hamano H. Donati M.A. Semrad C.E. Russell J.A. Andreu A.L. Hadjigeorgiou G.M. Vu T.H. Tadesse S.

Samples from three patients with diagnosis of autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia, another disorder associated with multiple deletions of mtDNA, were also studied. Two MNGIE patients underwent hemodialysis. Patient A underwent a single hemodialysis, and patient B underwent three consecutive weekly treatments. For each hemodialysis treatment, blood samples were collected immediately before the dialysis, pre-filtered and post-filtered blood 15 min after initiation of the treatment, immediately after completion, and 3 h, 19 h, 1, 2, and 3 days after dialysis. We measured thymidine concentration in these samples. The study was performed under a protocol approved by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board. The rate of conversion of thymidine to thymine was measured spectrophotometrically using modifications of methods described previously (11Friedkin M. Roberts D. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 207: 245-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Marsh J.C. Perry S. J. Clin. Invest. 1964; 43: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Gallo R.C. Perry S.

Buffy coats were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% 2-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to brief sonication. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for the enzyme assay. The protein content was determined through the bicinchoninic acid method (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). From each supernatant, 100–250 μg of protein was incubated with 0.1m Tris arsenate buffer, pH 6.5, and 10 mmthymidine in a total volume of 0.1 ml. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1 ml of 0.3m NaOH. Absorbance at 300 nm was measured, and the amount of thymine formed was determined using the 3.4 × 103liter/mol/cm difference in the molar extinction coefficient between thymidine and thymine at alkaline pH. Enzyme activity was expressed as the amount of thymine (nanomoles) generated per h per mg of protein. Results were obtained from two independent experiments performed in duplicate. Plasma, cell culture medium, and urine thymidine concentration was measured by an isocratic HPLC method. Anticoagulated blood samples were centrifuged and plasma removed and processed for HPLC analysis. In two patients, urine samples were collected for 24 h. Aliquots of urine were used to measure thymidine and creatinine levels. Simultaneous serum creatinine and plasma thymidine levels were measured. Urine samples were diluted 1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline prior to thymidine measurement. Plasma, cell culture medium, and diluted urine were treated with perchloric acid (0.5 m, final concentration) and centrifuged to remove the precipitated protein. Fifty μl of the supernatant were injected in an Alliance HPLC apparatus from Waters Associates, using an Alltima C18 NUC 100-Å, 5-μm, 250 × 4.6-mm, Alltech reverse phase column from Alltech, (Deerfield, IL). Injected samples were eluted with 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 10% methanol at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The absorption of the eluted materials was measured at 267 nm. Quantitation of thymidine was based on external standards. Definitive identification of the thymidine peak was based upon retention time and by treatment of a 2nd aliquot of the sample with a large excess of purified thymidine phosphorylase (from Sigma) to eliminate the thymidine. We analyzed the thymidine contents of cell culture medium over 10 days of culture of fibroblasts from three MNGIE patients and three controls. We plated 105fibroblasts from every patient or control in 10 35 × 10-mm Petri dishes (day 0) with 3 ml of minimum Eagle's medium from Invitrogen, plus 15% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 100 μm non-essential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1× minimum Eagle's medium vitamin solution from Invitrogen. We grew the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2. We trypsinized three plates of each cell line on the 2nd day, two plates on the 4th, 6th, and 8th day, and one plate on the 10th day, and we counted the number of cells in every plate. Prior to trypsinization, we saved 1 aliquot of medium from all of the plates, as well as from one plate of medium without cells as a blank to assess thymidine concentration by HPLC. Statistical analysis of the data was performed with SPSS 10.0 software. Distributions of values were tested for normality, and we used Student's t test to find differences between groups of normal distributions. We used nonparametric tests for non-normal distributions or whenn ≤ 10. TP activities in buffy coats were severely reduced in all 27 patients (2 ± 5 nmol/h/mg) compared with 19 controls (667 ± 205 nmol/h/mg) (p < 0.001) (Fig.1). Enzymatic activities in all patients were <5% of the normal control mean, and they were partially reduced in heterozygotes (236 ± 75 nmol/h/mg) compared with those of the controls (p < 0.001). The difference between patients and heterozygotes was also statistically significant (p< 0.001). There was no relationship between TP mutations and severity of the enzymatic defect or between enzymatic activity and clinical phenotype. Thymidine levels were dramatically increased in plasma from MNGIE patients (8.68 ± 5.23 μm) (range 3.5–24.7;n = 16), compared with normal controls or heterozygous TP mutation carriers, who did not show detectable levels of thymidine (n = 23 and 14, respectively). The detection limit of our method (0.05 μm) was established by repeating measurements (n = 10) of control plasma samples with decreasing concentrations of thymidine. We defined the detection limit as the lowest concentration that we were able to determine with a coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by average and expressed as percentage) ≤20% (data not shown). Table I shows plasma and urinary concentrations of thymidine in two patients and control subjects. Thymidine was undetectable in the urine of the controls, whereas it was high in the two patients. Both patients showed normal renal clearances of creatinine, whereas their clearances of thymidine were ∼20% that of creatinine.Table IUrinary excretion of thymidine in MNGIEnPl thdU thdU thdThd renal Clμmμmol Thd/mg Creat% Creat ClMNGIE (I)14.8960.1818.9MNGIE (II)110.34120.4919.1Controls6<0.05<1The abbreviations used are: Thd, thymidine; Creat, creatinine; Pl thd, concentration of thymidine in plasma; U thd, concentration of thymidine in urine; Cl, clearance.

Hemodialysis reduced circulating concentrations of thymidine in two patients; patient A underwent one dialysis, and patient B underwent three consecutive weekly dialysis treatments. Fig.2 shows the concentrations of plasma thymidine before, during, and after dialysis of both patients. The reduction in the plasma level of the nucleoside immediately after dialysis was about 50%, indicating that thymidine is ultrafiltratable. However, 3 h after dialysis, levels of the nucleoside had returned to pretreatment values. Over 10 days of culture, control fibroblasts gradually reduced thymidine concentration in the medium; by contrast, MNGIE fibroblasts from all patients tested released thymidine (Fig.3). We determined the linear regression of thymidine concentration in the medium over the time of culture of fibroblasts from patients and controls (TableII). The growth curves of the fibroblasts varied considerably. Fibroblasts from two MNGIE patients grew poorly compared with the controls; however, growth of fibroblasts from the third patient was comparable with that of the controls (Fig. 4). There was no correlation between number of the cells and thymidine concentration in the culture medium of the MNGIE fibroblasts; in fact, we found a significant negative correlation between these variables in the control group (−0.714; p = 0.001;n = 18), which disappeared when we adjusted the analysis by the time of the culture.Table IILinear regression of thymidine concentration in fibroblasts culture medium versus timeSloperpn(μmol/l/day) × 102Patient 13.70.9590.0036Patient 23.20.9460.0046Patient 33.60.9010.0376Control 1−4.8−0.9320.0076Control 2−4.5−0.9760.0015Control 3−4.9−0.9790.0016Values for Pearson's correlation coefficient are listed underr.

The identification of loss-of-function TP gene mutations has enabled us to study the pathogenesis of MNGIE. The functional significance of TP protein has been well characterized in vitro (10Brown N.S. Bicknell R. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). TP is a homodimer with an important role in the homeostasis of cellular nucleotide pools. Normally, TP protein catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of thymidine to thymine and 2-deoxy-d-ribose 1-phosphate. The forward reaction, conversion of thymidine to thymine, is important in the catabolism of the nucleoside, whereas the reverse reaction may be important for the pyrimidine salvage pathway, which allows thymidine to be converted to thymidine triphosphate (TTP), an essential building block of DNA. TP activity is drastically reduced in MNGIE patients compared with the controls, whereas the activities of the carriers are ∼35% of the normal value. This result is consistent with the fact that TP is a homodimer (15Kubilus J. Lee L.D. Baden H.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 527: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1704-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as we would expect 25% of functional enzyme when only 50% of monomers is normal. The most direct consequence of this loss of activity seems to be the accumulation of thymidine. Plasma concentrations of thymidine are elevated more than 60-fold in MNGIE patients compared with normal controls and asymptomatic carriers of heterozygous TP mutations. Therefore, only complete or near-total reduction of TP activity has detectable consequences on thymidine metabolism, because partially reduced activities of TP in carriers are sufficient to maintain low levels of circulating thymidine. We could not detect thymidine in plasma of normal controls or carriers, indicating that the concentration is less than 0.05 μm. This result contrasts with the higher concentrations previously reported (17Dudman N.P. Deveski W.B. Tattersall M.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Holden L. Hoffbrand A.V. Tattersall M.H. Eur. J. Cancer. 1980; 16: 115-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) ranging from <0.04 to 0.6 and 0.1 to 1.16 μm thymidine in normal human serum, respectively. Dudmanet al. (17Dudman N.P. Deveski W.B. Tattersall M.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) obtained their results using an HPLC method with UV detection. We verified the specificity of the thymidine peak by treating each sample with purified thymidine phosphorylase and comparing the result to those from untreated samples, in order to identify peaks, co-eluting at the same retention time as thymidine, that could account for falsely higher concentrations. Holden et al. (18Holden L. Hoffbrand A.V. Tattersall M.H. Eur. J. Cancer. 1980; 16: 115-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) used a radioimmunoassay; therefore, nonspecific signals could also account for their overestimation of circulating thymidine concentrations. In vitro studies of fibroblasts provides further evidence of altered thymidine metabolism in MNGIE patients. Normal fibroblasts gradually catabolize thymidine in the culture medium. By contrast, not only are MNGIE fibroblasts unable to degrade thymidine that is initially present in the medium, they even release thymidine. We did not identify a correlation between the number of MNGIE fibroblasts in culture and thymidine levels in the culture medium. These variables, cell number and thymidine level, seemed to show a clear negative correlation in the control group, which was actually due to the effect of the covariate, time, because the correlation disappeared when we adjusted for the time of culture. The lack of correlation between cell number and thymidine levels in the control group prevented us from identifying any quantitative relationship derived from the fact that more cells contains more TP. Fibroblasts from MNGIE patients did not show a homogeneous growing behavior; two cell lines of patients grew very poorly, but the third one showed a growing curve comparable with those of the control fibroblasts. The observation that one MNGIE cell line grew well indicates that loss of TP function and levels of thymidine, ≤0.90 μm, do not interfere with fibroblast growth in culture. Urinary excretion of thymidine is not completely effective in MNGIE patients. Normal controls do not eliminate thymidine through urine because they have absent or very low circulating concentrations of this nucleoside. By contrast, two analyzed MNGIE patients excreted high concentrations of thymidine in urine (96 and 412 μm), but the renal clearances of this nucleoside were very low compared with their clearance of creatinine. Plasma thymidine was reduced by hemodialysis in the patients, similarly to freely dialyzable molecules. However, after 3 h, the levels of the nucleoside returned to pre-dialysis values. Because thymidine is ultrafiltratable, the low renal clearance, as compared with that of creatinine, indicates that most of the filtered nucleoside is reabsorbed. A Na+/thymidine transporter is present in the brush border of the proximal tubule, likely responsible for the reabsorption (19Gutierrez M.M. Brett C.M. Ott R.J. Hui A.C. Giacomini K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a previous study (20Ensminger W.D. Frei III, E. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 1857-1863PubMed Google Scholar) reported low renal clearance of thymidine in humans when this compound was infused intravenously to induce steady-state blood concentrations around 1.5 μm. By contrast, other papers have reported high renal clearances when thymidine was infused to elevate steady-state blood levels to millimolar concentrations in humans (21Zaharko D.S. Bolten B.J. Chiuten D. Wiernik P.H. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 4777-4781PubMed Google Scholar) and in monkeys (22Zaharko D.S. Bolten B.J. Kobayashi T. Blasberg R.G. Lee S.S. Giovanella B.C. Stehlin Jr., J.S. Cancer Treat. Rep. 1979; 63: 945-949PubMed Google Scholar). MNGIE patients have increased blood thymidine in the micromolar range, but renal clearance for this nucleoside is low. Millimolar concentrations of thymidine probably saturate the reabsorption mechanism, accounting for the higher clearances. Our results indicate that determination of TP activity in buffy coats and circulating thymidine are powerful diagnostic tools to identify MNGIE patients. We are currently performing these tests in our laboratory and look for TP gene mutations only in those patients whose thymidine metabolism is demonstrated to be disturbed by the biochemical assays. The facts that MNGIE patients lack TP activity and accumulate thymidine, together with the previous observations of mtDNA alterations and mitochondrial dysfunction-like symptoms, suggest that high levels of thymidine causes mitochondrial DNA impairment. In MNGIE patients, alterations of the thymidine salvage pathway seem to affect deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools more severely in mitochondria than in nuclei. One possible reason for this selective effect is that mitochondria are thought to have separate and independently regulated dNTP pools (23Bestwick R.K. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9305-9308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bestwick R.K. Moffett G.L. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9300-9304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Berk A.J. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2722-2729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bogenhagen and Clayton (26Bogenhagen D. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 249: 2938-2944Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) showed that mitochondrial DNA replication in mouse L cells is resistant to inhibition by methotrexate or 5-flurodeoxyuridine; both agents blockde novo thymidine synthesis by inhibiting thymidylate synthetase that converts dUMP to thymidylate (deoxythymidine monophosphate or dTMP). Subsequently, Bestwick and colleagues (23Bestwick R.K. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9305-9308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bestwick R.K. Moffett G.L. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9300-9304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated an expansion of the mitochondrial nucleoside triphosphate pools of the cells in response to those anti-metabolites. These results indicate that mitochondria depend more on the thymidine salvage pathway than on the de novo synthetic pathway. Because of this dependence on thymidine salvage pathway, mitochondrial dTTP pools could be perturbed by alterations of thymidine levels. The existence of a mitochondrial specific thymidine kinase 2, which converts thymidine to thymidine monophosphate, probably contributes to the alterations of the mitochondrial dNTP pool (24Bestwick R.K. Moffett G.L. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9300-9304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Berk A.J. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2722-2729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Johansson M. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 13: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 is expressed constitutively, in contrast to the cytosolic thymidine kinase 1 that is up-regulated during cell division (28Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The constant activity of thymidine kinase 2 is likely to contribute to the susceptibility of mitochondrial dNTP pools to altered thymidine levels. We hypothesize that the mitochondrial dNTP pools are altered and lead to mtDNA depletion and multiple deletions in patients with MNGIE. If high concentrations of thymidine are the cause of mitochondrial DNA impairment, one possible therapy for MNGIE will be to reduce or, if possible, to virtually eliminate thymidine from blood. Hemodialysis does not seem to be a very effective strategy, because the rate of production of thymidine in MNGIE patients may exceed the ability of the dialysis to eliminate the molecule from the blood, restoring the pre-dialysis concentrations <3 h after the end of the treatment. Alternatively, it is possible that large body stores of thymidine are rapidly released into blood after hemodialysis and that multiple dialysis treatments may ultimately be effective in removing accumulated thymidine in MNGIE patients. Another treatment strategy is blocking the reabsorption of the nucleoside by the kidney, thereby increasing the urinary elimination of thymidine. Several descriptions of the kinetics and pharmacological properties of nucleoside transporters in the cell have been published (19Gutierrez M.M. Brett C.M. Ott R.J. Hui A.C. Giacomini K.M. Biochim.

Decreasing the rate of renal reabsorption of thymidine by chemically inhibiting nucleoside carriers could lead to a significant decrease in thymidine concentrations in blood of MNGIE patients. If such a strategy is effective, it is probably necessary to treat the patients as early as possible, in order to avoid probable irreversible consequences of thymidine toxicity on cells. In summary, as a consequence of loss of TP activity, MNGIE patients accumulate thymidine, which cannot be efficiently eliminated from blood. TP activity measurement in buffy coats and thymidine in plasma are of diagnostic value for this disease. We hypothesize that, in MNGIE patients, persistently elevated levels of thymidine unbalances nucleotide pools in mitochondria, leading to mtDNA abnormalities; therefore, therapeutic strategies to reduce thymidine concentration in blood of these patients may be effective."

However, it has yet to be demonstrated that these inflammatory cells target hypochlorous acid against bacteria inside phagosomes. In this investigation, we treatedStaphylococcus aureus with varying concentrations of reagent hypochlorous acid and found that even at sublethal doses, it converted some tyrosine residues in their proteins to 3-chlorotyrosine and 3,5-dichlorotyrosine. To determine whether or not ingested bacteria were exposed to hypochlorous acid in neutrophil phagosomes, we labeled their proteins with [13C6]tyrosine and used gas chromatography with mass spectrometry to identify the corresponding chlorinated isotopes after the bacteria had been phagocytosed. Chlorinated tyrosines were detected in bacterial proteins 5 min after phagocytosis and reached levels of approximately 2.5/1000 mol of tyrosine at 60 min. Inhibitor studies revealed that chlorination was dependent on myeloperoxidase. Chlorinated neutrophil proteins were also detected and accounted for 94% of total chlorinated tyrosine residues formed during phagocytosis. We conclude that hypochlorous acid is a major intracellular product of the respiratory burst. Although some reacts with the bacteria, most reacts with neutrophil components.

Immunity in Infective Diseases. Johnson Reprint Corporation, New York1968Google Scholar) first observed phagocytosis of bacteria in white blood cells, numerous investigations have been undertaken to determine the mechanisms responsible for bacterial killing. It is now well established that neutrophils use oxidative and non-oxidative mechanisms to kill bacteria (2Hampton M.B. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. CIBA Found. Symp. 1992; 171: 276-290PubMed Google Scholar). However, our understanding of the precise ways in which these host defenses work is still in its infancy. This is especially true for how neutrophils use oxygen to fight infection. When they phagocytose bacteria, neutrophils rapidly consume oxygen, which is reduced to superoxide by an NADPH oxidase. Superoxide is not toxic to bacteria but spawns numerous other reactive oxygen species that have been implicated in bacterial killing (4Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation:Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 721-768Google Scholar). Chief among these is hypochlorous acid, which is formed from hydrogen peroxide and chloride in a reaction catalyzed by myeloperoxidase (5Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Results from several studies indicate that myeloperoxidase is required for the majority of oxygen-dependent killing of certain bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (4Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation:Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 721-768Google Scholar, 6Hampton M.B. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Infect.

It is released into phagosomes along with superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (8Karnovsky M.J. Histochemistry. 1994; 102: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, myeloperoxidase is a complex enzyme with several different activities (5Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), and it can not be assumed that its predominant function within neutrophil phagosomes is to produce hypochlorous acid. Early studies showing incorporation of chlorine-36 (9Zgliczynski J.M. Stelmaszynska T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 56: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and iodination of bacterial and neutrophil proteins (10Segal A.W. Garcia R.C. Harper A.M. Banga J.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) indicated that hypohalous acids are produced when neutrophils undergo phagocytosis. More recently, it was demonstrated that free tyrosine enclosed inside red blood cell ghosts was chlorinated when these vesicles were phagocytosed by neutrophils (11Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Also, fluorescein conjugated to polyacrylamide microspheres was extensively chlorinated when the beads were ingested by neutrophils (12Jiang Q. Griffin D.A. Barofsky D.F. Hurst J.K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1080-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Approximately 10% of oxygen consumed by the neutrophils was accounted for as chlorofluoresceins, which was suggested to be sufficient to kill bacteria (12Jiang Q. Griffin D.A. Barofsky D.F. Hurst J.K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1080-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has yet to be shown that hypochlorous acid is produced in phagosomes when neutrophils engulf bacteria, and whether it is responsible for killing them. Therefore, we sought evidence that hypochlorous acid reacts with ingested bacteria by showing that bacterial molecules are modified by a reaction that is specific to hypochlorous acid. The modification we selected was the conversion of tyrosine residues in proteins to 3-chlorotyrosine and 3,5-dichlorotyrosine (11Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 13Domigan N.M. Charlton T.S. Duncan M.W. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. J. Biol.

Although these chlorinated molecules are minor products of the reaction of hypochlorous acid with proteins, they are stable and specific for this oxidant and as such are appropriate markers for verifying its production (17Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that tyrosine residues in bacterial proteins are chlorinated after bacteria have been phagocytosed by neutrophils. This result demonstrates that hypochlorous acid is produced in phagosomes and reacts with bacteria. We also show that the vast majority of chlorination occurs on neutrophil rather than bacterial proteins. The concentration of the hypochlorous acid stock solution (Reckitt and Coleman, Auckland, New Zealand) was determined using either 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid as described previously (18Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) or its absorbance maximum at 292 nm (pH 12, ε292 = 350m−1.cm−1) (19Gazda M. Margerum D.W. Inorg.

Chlorinated tyrosine [13C9] internal standards were prepared as described previously (16Chapman A.L.P. Senthilmohan R. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). S. aureus ATCC 27217 (502a) was purchased from the New Zealand Communicable Disease Center (Porirua, New Zealand). Columbia sheep blood agar plates were from Fort Richard (New Zealand), and nutrient broth no. 1 was from Oxoid Ltd. (Basingstoke, UK). All other chemicals were purchased from the Sigma or BDH (Poole, UK). S. aureuswere grown overnight in nutrient broth at 37 °C with agitation. In experiments requiring labeled bacteria, 1 mml-tyrosine-RING-[13C6] was added to the broth prior to inoculation. Bacteria were centrifuged at 1700 × g for 5 min and washed twice with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mmsodium chloride (PBS).1 The concentration of the bacteria was determined by turbidity measurements at 550 nm (0.2 absorbance units/ml corresponded to 1 × 108 colonies forming units). Bacteria (1 × 109/ml) were opsonized in 10% pooled serum for 20 min at 37 °C and then washed as described above. Typically, 108bacteria were treated with 1–30 nmol of hypochlorous acid in 1 ml of PBS. After 20 min at 37 °C, an aliquot of each sample was removed, and colony forming units were determined. The remainder was centrifuged at 5000 × g, washed twice with PBS, and the pellet was assayed for chlorinated tyrosines. Neutrophils were isolated from the blood of healthy donors by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation, dextran sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis of contaminating red cells (20Böyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in HBSS (PBS, glucose (1 mg/ml), MgCl2(0.5 mm), CaCl2 (1 mm)) at 1 × 107/ml. Neutrophils were also isolated from an individual who we have previously shown to be deficient in myeloperoxidase (21Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17146-17151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria were labeled with [13C6]tyrosine and opsonized as described above, and then 1 × 108 bacteria were added to 5 × 106 neutrophils in 0.5 ml of HBSS with 10% autologous serum. Samples were continuously rotated and, after set time intervals, were placed on melting ice, and an additional 0.5 ml of HBSS was added. Neutrophils and phagocytosed bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 80 × g. Supernatants were kept to determine the number of bacteria that were not phagocytosed. The pellets containing neutrophils and phagocytosed bacteria were washed twice with PBS and then suspended in 1.5 ml of a lysis buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% centrimide, pH 7.0) and sonicated (2 × 15-s bursts with a 4.5 mm probe, Rapidis 600 Sonicator, Ultrasonics Ltd., Shipley, UK). The resulting sonicates were centrifuged at 13,000 × gfor 5 min to isolate phagocytosed bacteria. Aliquots of the supernatant containing predominantly soluble neutrophil proteins ([12C]tyrosines) and the pellets containing phagocytosed bacteria ([13C6]tyrosines) were assayed for chlorinated tyrosines. The numbers of extracellular and intracellular bacteria were determined, and the rates of phagocytosis and killing were calculated (22Hampton M.B. Winterbourn C.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GC/MS analysis of chlorinated tyrosines was based on the method developed by Heinecke et al. (23Heinecke J.W. Hsu F.F. Crowley J.R. Hazen S.L. Leeuwenburgh C. Mueller D.M. Rasmussen J.E. Turk J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 124-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Neutrophil proteins containing [12C]tyrosine and bacterial proteins containing [13C6]tyrosine were acid-hydrolyzed in 6n hypobromic acid or 4 nmethanesulphonic acid supplemented with 1% phenol for 18 h at 110 °C in the presence of [13C9] internal standards. Hydrolyzed proteins were solid phase-extracted to concentrate aromatic amino acids. Alltech Extract-Clean C18 cartridges (500 mg in 2.8 ml) were pre-conditioned with 3 ml of high pressure liquid chromatography grade methanol followed by 2 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were made up to 400 μl in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, sonicated briefly, and applied to the cartridges. The cartridges were washed with a further 2 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to remove hydrophilic amino acids. Tyrosine and chlorinated tyrosines were eluted with 1 ml of 80% methanol containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluates were collected into glass vials. Samples were derivatized and analyzed by GC/MS in selective ion mode using a Hewlett Packard 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 30 m DB-17 capillary column that was interfaced to a Hewlett Packard 5973 mass spectrometer as described previously (16Chapman A.L.P.

We initially measured chlorination of tyrosine residues in bacterial proteins after treatment with various doses of hypochlorous acid with the aim of recovering bacteria from neutrophil phagosomes and predicting their level of exposure to hypochlorous acid. S. aureus were treated with hypochlorous acid at doses ranging from 1 to 30 nmol/1 × 108 cells for 20 min at 37 °C. This resulted in the conversion of tyrosine residues to 3-chlorotyrosine and 3,5-dichlorotyrosine (Fig.1). Bacterial viability was completely lost at a dose of approximately 25 nmol of hypochlorous acid/108 bacteria (Fig. 2). The corresponding level of chlorination was approximately 6 mol of 3-chlorotyrosines/1000 mol of tyrosine. At all doses of hypochlorous acid, yields of 3,5-dichlorotyrosine were at least 4-fold less than those of 3-chlorotyrosine. These results demonstrate that chlorinated tyrosine residues are formed in bacterial proteins at and below bactericidal doses of hypochlorous acid.Figure 2The relationship between chlorination and viability in S. aureus treated with hypochlorous acid. Bacteria (1 × 108) were treated with hypochlorous acid at doses ranging from 1 to 30 nmol for 20 min at 37 °C. Aliquots of each sample were diluted and plated to assess viability. The bacteria remaining in the sample were acid-hydrolyzed and assayed for chlorinated tyrosines as in Fig. 1. Closed circles represent 3-chlorotyrosine, and open trianglesrepresent viability. All the data from four independent experiments are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above experiments were performed at pH 7.4. However, the pH inside phagosomes changes during phagocytosis. Initially, the pH is 7.4, but rises to almost 8 in the first 5 min and then declines to 6 throughout the next hour (24Segal A.W. Geisow M. Garcia R. Harper A. Miller R. Nature. 1981; 290: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 25Cech P. Lehrer R.I. Blood. 1984; 63: 88-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When S. aureus (1 × 108) were treated with 10 nmol of hypochlorous acid at pH 6, 7.4, and 8, the degree of 3-chlorotyrosine formation was 1.1, 1.8, and 2.9/1000 tyrosines, respectively. These values are means of duplicate experiments in which the ranges differed by <10%. At all pH values, the levels of 3-chlorotyrosine were approximately 4-fold higher than those of 3,5-dichlorotyrosine (data not shown). When opsonized bacteria were added to neutrophils at a ratio of 20:1, they were phagocytosed with a half-life of 9 min. Once ingested, the half-life for killing was 3 min. Twenty minutes after adding bacteria to neutrophils, 80% had been ingested, and 70% were killed. The ingested bacteria were isolated, and their proteins were subsequently analyzed by GC/MS for chlorinated tyrosines. We were able to distinguish between bacterial and neutrophil proteins because theS. aureus were grown in nutrient broth containing [13C6]tyrosine. The level of incorporation of [13C6]tyrosine into bacterial proteins ranged from 30 to 40% of the total tyrosine residues as measured by GC/MS analysis. We reasoned that if any 3-chloro-[13C6]tyrosine or 3,5-dichloro-[13C6]tyrosine was detected in proteins extracted from neutrophils after they had phagocytosed the bacteria, it would demonstrate unequivocally that hypochlorous acid was produced inside the phagosomes, and that it had reacted with the bacteria. After ingestion of bacteria, the neutrophils were lysed, and the bacteria were pelleted. The amount of [13C6]tyrosine detected in the pellets after 20 min was variable and ranged from 10–83% of the quantity in the bacteria that had been added to the cells. The mean and standard deviation was 35 ± 27% (n = 10). This variability represents differences in phagocytosis and subsequent losses because of digestion and incomplete recovery during processing. GC/MS analysis of hydrolyzed proteins from bacterial pellets also revealed the presence of both 3-chloro-[13C6]tyrosine and 3,5-dichloro-[13C6]tyrosine (Fig.3 A). The mass spectrum of 3-chloro-[13C6]tyrosine is shown in Fig.3 B and demonstrates the characteristic isotopic cluster of a monochlorinated molecule with ions at m/z 455 and 457 in the ratio of 3:1. 3-Chloro-[13C6]tyrosine could be detected in bacterial proteins after 5 min and reached levels of 2/1000 moles of tyrosine after 60 min (Fig. 4). 3,5-Dichloro-[13C6]tyrosine was also formed but to a lesser extent, reaching a maximum of approximately 0.8/1000 mol of tyrosine. Its mass spectrum gave the characteristic 9:6:1 ratio expected for a doubly chlorinated molecule (data not shown).Figure 4Time course for intraphagosomal chlorination. Bacteria (1 × 108) were incubated with neutrophils (5 × 106) for 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min, acid-hydrolyzed and assayed for chlorinated [13C6]tyrosines as described in Fig. 1.Closed circles represent 3-chlorotyrosine, and open circles represent 3,5-dichlorotyrosine. Data are the means and standard deviations of three experiments. Each experiment was performed on different days using neutrophils from different individuals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 5, chlorination was decreased by diphenyleneiodonium, which inhibits the neutrophil NADPH oxidase, and by the heme poison azide. Chlorination was substantially less in bacteria that had been ingested by neutrophils from an individual who was deficient in myeloperoxidase. These results confirm that chlorination of bacterial proteins resulted from the generation of hypochlorous acid by myeloperoxidase. Taurine and catalase did not inhibit chlorination. These latter results imply that chlorination of bacteria occurred in a compartment that was not accessible to extracellular scavengers of hypochlorous acid and hydrogen peroxide. Several studies have revealed that neutrophils are susceptible to their own oxidants (26Beck-Speier I. Leuschel L. Luippold G. Maier K.L. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Ogino T. Packer L. Maguire J.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether hypochlorous acid also reacts with neutrophil components, neutrophil proteins were examined for evidence of chlorination. We first determined how readily reagent hypochlorous acid chlorinated tyrosine residues in neutrophil proteins. As shown in Fig.6, the formation of 3-chlorotyrosine was relatively inefficient at low doses of hypochlorous acid but increased exponentially as the dose was increased. Presumably, at low doses the hypochlorous acid would preferentially react with thiols, methionine residues, and ascorbate in neutrophils (28Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 29Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). At higher doses, more would be available to chlorinate tyrosyl residues in proteins. This effect was not evident when bacteria were treated with hypochlorous acid (Fig. 2), even though the lowest doses of oxidant/tyrosine residue were similar (3 nmol of hypochlorous acid/40 pmol of Tyr for bacteria and 50 nmol of hypochlorous acid/480 pmol of Tyr for neutrophils). It is not entirely clear why a scavenging effect was not observed with bacteria. However, it may simply reflect the sensitivity of our assay, because 6.5-fold less 3-chlorotyrosine was formed in bacteria (40 fmol) than in neutrophils (265 fmol) at the lowest doses of hypochlorous acid. Next, we examined the ability of neutrophils to chlorinate their own proteins. After neutrophils had undergone phagocytosis of S. aureus, they were lysed, the bacteria were pelleted, and the remaining soluble protein was assayed for its content of 3-chlorotyrosine and 3,5-dichlorotyrosine. There was minimal [13C6]tyrosine contamination in this fraction, confirming that it contained predominantly neutrophil proteins (data not shown). Both 3-chlorotyrosine and 3,5-dichlorotyrosine were detected in neutrophil proteins (Fig.7). The level of chlorination rose steadily over 60 min with 4 mol of 3-chlorotyrosine and 2 mol of 3,5-dichlorotyrosine formed/1000 mol of tyrosines (Fig. 7). The inhibitor profile was similar to that seen with bacterial chlorination and indicated that chlorination of neutrophil proteins was dependent on myeloperoxidase (Fig. 8). However, azide dramatically enhanced the chlorination of neutrophil proteins. This effect is most probably attributed to greater inhibition of cytosolic catalase compared with the myeloperoxidase contained in the azurophilic granules (30Ohno Y. Gallin J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8438-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of azide, there would be more hydrogen peroxide available for conversion to hypochlorous acid.Figure 8Requirement for myeloperoxidase in the chlorination of neutrophil proteins resulting from phagocytosis of bacteria. Neutrophils (5 × 106) were pre-incubated with either diphenyleneiodonium (10 μm), azide (1 mm), catalase (20 μg/ml), or taurine (10 mm) for 10 min. Bacteria (1 × 108) were added, and samples were incubated for an additional 20 min. Cells were lysed, and chlorinated tyrosines were measured in the acid hydrolysates of soluble neutrophil proteins as described in Fig. 7. Data are the means and standard deviations of three experiments with the exception of taurine, which was done in duplicate. The data for the MPO-deficient individual are the means of duplicates from one experiment. Each experiment was performed on different days using neutrophils from different individuals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The extent of chlorination in each cell type was compared to establish the relative amounts of hypochlorous acid that had reacted with bacteria or neutrophils. Twenty minutes after bacteria were added to neutrophils, the ratio of 3-chlorotyrosine to tyrosine was twice that observed with bacterial proteins (TableII). To calculate the absolute amounts of chlorinated tyrosines in bacterial and neutrophil proteins, the total amounts of tyrosine residues in each cell type were measured. As shown in Table II, there were considerably more tyrosine residues in the neutrophils than the bacteria. The ratios for chlorination were then multiplied by the total amounts of tyrosine to get absolute values for the contents of 3-chlorotyrosine and 3,5-dichlorotyrosine in bacteria and neutrophils. This comparison revealed that 94% of incorporated chlorine was present in neutrophil proteins. That is, the majority of the hypochlorous acid generated during phagocytosis had reacted with the neutrophil.Table IIComparison of chlorination in bacterial and neutrophil proteins1 × 108Bacteria5 × 106 Neutrophils3-chlorotyrosine/1000 Tyr1.2 ± 0.2 (n = 12)2.0 ± 0.2 (n = 12)3,5-dichlorotyrosine/1000 Tyr0.6 ± 0.1 (n = 9)0.6 ± 0.1 (n = 10)Total Tyr (pmol)39.9 ± 5.3 (n = 10)2-aThe value given is for the 80% bacteria that was ingested after 20 min.482 ± 91 (n = 9)Total 3-chlorotyrosine (fmol)48964Total 3,5-dichlorotyrosine (fmol)24289Total chlorination (fmol) (chlorotyrosine + 2× dichlorotyrosine)961542% Total chlorination694Chlorination of bacterial and neutrophil proteins after 20 min of incubation were determined as in Figs. 4 and 7.

We calculated the efficiency of chlorination in each cell type at a dose of reagent hypochlorous acid that converted one tyrosine in 1000 to 3-chlorotyrosine. With 1 × 108 bacteria, 3 nmol of hypochlorous acid gave rise to 40 fmol of 3-chlorotyrosine,i.e. 13 fmol of 3-chlorotyrosine were formed/nmol hypochlorous acid (see Fig. 2). In contrast, the addition of 100 nmol of hypochlorous acid to 5 × 106 neutrophils produced 482 fmol of 3-chlorotyrosine, i.e. 5 fmol of 3-chlorotyrosine were formed/nmol hypochlorous acid (see Fig. 6). Thus, tyrosine residues in bacteria were chlorinated ∼2.5 times more efficiently as those in neutrophils. We have shown that hypochlorous acid is produced inside neutrophil phagosomes during bacterial killing and that it reacts with the bacteria. Surprisingly though, we have also demonstrated that the majority of chlorination occurs on neutrophil proteins. Only 6% of the chlorinated tyrosines were present in bacterial proteins. These results indicate that the majority of hypochlorous acid produced during phagocytosis reacts with neutrophil components rather than the ingested bacteria. We were able to reveal these novel findings by labeling bacteria with [13C6]tyrosine so that we could distinguish between bacterial and neutrophil proteins. The detection of chlorinated tyrosine residues in proteins by GC/MS analysis gave unequivocal evidence that hypochlorous acid had been produced within neutrophils when they phagocytosed bacteria and was also used to determine the fate of the oxidant. Our conclusions are based on the caveat that the formation of chlorinated tyrosines adequately describes the reactions of hypochlorous acid within neutrophils. It is possible that because these biomarkers are minor products of protein modification by hypochlorous acid (14Kettle A.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), they may not accurately reflect what happens with the majority of the oxidant. However, this presumed disadvantage has to be weighed against the real advantage that 3-chlorotyrosine and 3,5-dichlorotyrosine are the only biomarkers of protein modification that are specific to hypochlorous acid (15Fu S. Wang H. Davies M. Dean R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,31Kettle A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Others (32Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Melton D.F. Thomas E.L. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2003-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that hypochlorous acid is produced extracellularly when neutrophils are stimulated with a variety of agonists. It has also been shown to be generated within phagosomes (11Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,12Jiang Q. Griffin D.A. Barofsky D.F. Hurst J.K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1080-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, our study is the first to show that hypochlorous acid is produced inside phagosomes when neutrophils ingest bacteria. Inhibitor studies confirmed that chlorination of proteins was dependent on myeloperoxidase. A lack of inhibition by catalase and taurine, which scavenge hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid, respectively, is consistent with the proposal that chlorination of bacteria and neutrophils were intracellular events. Neither catalase nor taurine would be expected to enter the cell or the phagosome in sufficient quantities to affect reactions of myeloperoxidase. Our report finally confirms the original proposal of Klebanoff (35Klebanoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1967; 126: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) that neutrophils use the myeloperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/chloride system to generate hypochlorous acid for antimicrobial defense. We had anticipated the bacteria would be heavily chlorinated inside phagosomes. However, the extent of chlorination after 20 min of phagocytosis was equivalent to that achieved in isolated bacteria that were treated with only 5 nmol of reagent hypochlorous acid/108 cells. It is possible that chlorinated proteins were preferentially exported from bacteria (36Thomas E.L. Infect. Immun. 1979; 23: 522-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or had enhanced proteolytic digestion (37Olszowska E. Olszowski S. Zgliczynski J.M. Stelmaszynska T. Int. J. Biochem. 1989; 21: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the recovery of [13C6]tyrosine that was incorporated into bacterial proteins varied considerably among experiments. Yet the extent of chlorination showed little variation. This indicates that the chlorination of the bacterial protein we isolated was representative of the total, and that we had not failed to detect highly chlorinated bacterial proteins. It is possible to underestimate the extent of chlorination, because 3-chlorotyrosine reacts readily with hypochlorous acid to form additional chlorinated products (15Fu S. Wang H. Davies M. Dean R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Chapman A.L.P. Senthilmohan R. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, we checked for this possibility by measuring the levels of 3,5-dichlorotyrosine that were low and confirmed that the bacteria were minimally chlorinated. Our estimates of the amount of hypochlorous acid that reacted with bacteria inside phagosomes were based on the extent of bacterial chlorination by reagent hypochlorous acid at pH 7.4. The efficiency of this reaction was found to increase over the pH range that occurs during phagocytosis. In the first 20 min of phagocytosis, the phagosome has a slightly alkaline pH (24Segal A.W. Geisow M. Garcia R. Harper A. Miller R. Nature. 1981; 290: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 25Cech P. Lehrer R.I. Blood. 1984; 63: 88-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our estimates of the amount of hypochlorous acid that reacted with the bacteria would be expected to be slightly higher than the actual values. Even so, they do indicate that the bacteria had been subjected to low but microbicidal doses of hypochlorous acid. It is conceivable that because of the presence of other antimicrobial agents, bacteria are likely to be more susceptible to killing by hypochlorous acid generated inside phagosomes than to reagent hypochlorous acid added to them in isolation. For example, elastase is known to greatly enhance the bactericidal activity of the myeloperoxidase-glucose oxidase system (38Odeberg H. Olsson I. Infect. Immun. 1976; 14: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, we cannot make a firm conclusion on the precise contribution hypochlorous acid made to the killing of the bacteria. Previously, it has been shown that when neutrophils ingest S. aureus at a ratio of 20 bacteria/phagocyte, they consume approximately 1.8 nmol of oxygen/106 cells/min (39Yazdanbakhsh M. Eckmann C.M. Bot A.A. Roos D. Infect. Immun. 1986; 53: 192-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If this rate was sustained, we would expect that the maximum amount of hypochlorous acid, which could be produced in our experiments, with 5 × 106 cells over 20 min would be 180 nmol. Adding 130 nmol of reagent hypochlorous acid to neutrophils gave a similar degree of chlorination of their proteins as that observed when the cells underwent phagocytosis (compare Fig. 6 with Fig. 7). Based on these values, we can estimate that approximately 70% of the oxygen consumed by neutrophils was used to make intracellular hypochlorous acid. Thus, hypochlorous acid should be considered as a major product of the respiratory burst when neutrophils ingest and kill bacteria. Hurst and co-workers (12Jiang Q. Griffin D.A. Barofsky D.F. Hurst J.K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1080-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) previously estimated that a minimum of 10% hydrogen peroxide is converted to hypochlorous acid. This value was based on the extent to which fluorescein conjugated to polyacrylamide microspheres was chlorinated. The value is likely to be a lower limit, because they did not consider chlorination of neutrophil components in their study. Our finding that the majority of the chlorinated tyrosines formed during phagocytosis is in neutrophil proteins demonstrates that most of the hypochlorous acid produced during the respiratory burst reacts with the neutrophils. We checked the efficiency of chlorination in each cell type and found that 3-chlorotyrosine was formed approximately twice as readily in bacterial proteins than in neutrophil proteins. Thus, based on the assumption that reagent hypochlorous acid reacts similarly to hypochlorous acid generated inside neutrophils, we conclude that the greater degree of chlorination of neutrophil proteins during phagocytosis cannot be attributed to them being more efficiently chlorinated than bacteria. Previously, it was found that neutrophil components including methionine residues (26Beck-Speier I. Leuschel L. Luippold G. Maier K.L. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and thiols (27Ogino T. Packer L. Maguire J.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Carr A.C. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) undergo extensive oxidation when the cells are stimulated. In these studies it was inferred that hypochlorous acid was responsible for most of the oxidant measured. However, specific biomarkers were not used to categorically prove its involvement. Analogous results to those presented here have been reported for iodination of proteins following phagocytosis of bacteria (10Segal A.W. Garcia R.C. Harper A.M. Banga J.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 41Joiner K.A. Ganz T. Albert J. Rotrosen D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2771-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Most of the radioactive iodine was associated with neutrophil proteins, not bacterial proteins, which supports our proposal that most of the hypochlorous acid reacts with neutrophil components. A simple explanation for this result is that because hypochlorous acid can readily pass through cell membranes (42Vissers M.C.M. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and diffuse considerable distances compared with the size of a bacterium (43Lymar S.L. Hurst J.K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it will react mainly with the neutrophil, which provides the biggest sink for this reactive oxidant. The extensive oxidation of neutrophil components by hypochlorous acid does raise the possibility that modification of some of them may be play a beneficial role in microbial killing. In future studies, it will be important to identify which neutrophil molecules are oxidized during phagocytosis and to determine how this affects their antimicrobial activity."

Both neutrophil and Paneth cell α-defensins derive from ∼10-kDa prepropeptides that contain canonical signal sequences, acidic proregions, and an ∼3.5-kDa mature α-defensin peptide in the C-terminal portion of the precursor. For example, maturation of myeloid pro-α-defensins appears to involve two primary cleavage steps, and most α-defensins in mature phagocytic leukocytes are completely processed (17Michaelson D.

The products of in vitro cleavage of procryptdin-1 and natural procryptdins by MMP-7, the localization of the cryptdin proregion in the exocytotic pathway, and the extent of procryptdin activation in Paneth cells of adult mice have now been characterized. Our results show that extensive intracellular procryptdin activation occurs in mouse Paneth cells and that exposure to bacterial antigens does not induce procryptdin processing in mice. All procedures on mice were performed in compliance with the policies of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Irvine (UCI). 45-Day-old male outbred Swiss mice ((Crl:CD-1)(ICR)BR), 6-week-old adult male BALB/cJ and C57/BL6 mice, 6-week-old pregnant female BALB/cJ mice, and 6-week-old adult male germ-free Swiss mice were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc.

Granules in the combined supernatants were deposited by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C in the Sorvall SA-600 rotor, and granules in the high speed pellet were washed two to three times by resuspension and centrifugation in Hanks' EDTA solution under the same conditions. Granules were stored frozen or dissolved immediately in 30% acetic acid and extracted as described above. Lyophilized peptide samples were dissolved in 20 μl of 5% acetic acid containing 3.0 m urea and electrophoresed on 12.5% acid/urea-polyacrylamide gels for 6 h at 150 V (29Selsted M.E. Genet. Eng. 1993; 15: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Resolved proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 after fixation in Formalin-containing acetic acid/methanol. α-Defensins were identified by their rapid comigration with authentic mouse cryptdin peptides on acid/urea-polyacrylamide gels (>0.6 ×R F of methyl green dye) as described (30Selsted M.E. Becker III, H.W. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and confirmed immunochemically by Western blotting (15Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C.

(Hopkinton, MA). The composition and concentration of the synthetic prosegment were determined by amino acid analysis on a Waters Model 2690 Alliance Analyzer, and its mass was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) on a Voyager-DE instrument (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the UCI Biomedical Protein and Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility. Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. produced polyclonal anti-cryptdin-1 prosegment antiserum in a sheep by administering four dorsal subcutaneous injections of prosegment conjugated to bovine serum albumin in complete Freund's adjuvant. Injections were repeated twice, and the antiserum titer was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. The primary structures of prosegments in all mouse defensin family precursors are highly conserved (see Fig. 1 A), and the antibody is likely to cross-react with all mouse defensin family precursors. Rabbit antisera to the cysteine-rich sequence-1c (CRS1C-1) prosegment (34Lin M.Y. Munshi I.A. Ouellette A.J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 35Ouellette A.J.

Immunoperoxidase staining was performed by the Histology Laboratory of the Department of Pathology, UCI Medical Center. Paraffin sections of Formalin-fixed mouse small bowel were deparaffinized with xylenes, treated for 30 min with 0.3% H2O2, and washed with water and PBS. Slides were incubated three times for 5 min each in a microwave oven with antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and then cooled in unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, sections were blocked by incubation with normal goat serum for 30 min and with avidin D blocking solution for 15 min, rinsed briefly with PBS, and then incubated with biotin blocking solution (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) for 15 min. Slides were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of sheep anti-cryptdin-1 prosegment immune antiserum or with serum from the sheep prior to immunization. After 30 min, slides were washed three times with PBS, incubated for 30 min with a 1:2000 dilution of biotinylated donkey anti-sheep IgG (28Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and washed as described above. After 60 min of incubation with Vectastain ABC peroxidase reagent (Vector Laboratories, Inc.), slides were washed, flooded with diaminobenzidine, washed, and counterstained before mounting. For immunogold co-localization of the mature peptide and cryptdin-1 prosegment, samples of jejunum were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and embedded in Unicryl (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding CA) at −20 °C. Thin sections placed on Formvar and carbon-coated grids were stained with rabbit anti-cryptdin-1 antibody (28Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), washed, and reacted with a 1:25 dilution of protein A labeled with 10-nm gold (Ted Pella, Inc.) as described (27Ouellette A.J.

Next, sections were incubated with sheep anti-cryptdin-1 prosegment immune IgG (1:200) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, sections were incubated with donkey anti-sheep IgG conjugated to 20-nm gold. Sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, examined in a Jeol 100 CX electron microscope, and photographed. Equivalent dilutions of preimmune sera provided negative controls in all experiments. Recombinant procryptdin-1 was prepared as described previously (21Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse procryptdin-1 cDNA cloned in pMalc2 (New England Biolabs Inc. Beverly, MA) was expressed as a maltose-binding protein fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that was purified by amylose resin affinity chromatography. Procryptdin-1, released from the fusion protein by digestion with 1 μg of Factor Xa (New England Biolabs Inc.)/mg of fusion protein at 30 °C for 48 h, was separated from maltose-binding protein by C4 RP-HPLC on a Vydac 214TP1010 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) and purified to homogeneity by analytical C18 RP-HPLC on a Vydac 218TP54 column (21Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). For purification of mouse enteric procryptdins, small intestine protein extracts were prepared from MMP-7-null mice by extraction with 30% acetic acid as described above. Protein samples were applied to analytical C18 RP-HPLC columns (Vydac 218TP54) in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted at ∼35 min using a 10–45% acetonitrile gradient developed over 55 min. Protein fractions containing apparent procryptdins were analyzed by acid/urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE) as described (21Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 29Selsted M.E. Genet. Eng. 1993; 15: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Procryptdins A–C were purified to homogeneity by C18 RP-HPLC using a 120-min 10–40% acetonitrile gradient, from which cryptdin precursors eluted between 18 and 30% acetonitrile (data not shown). The identification of the purified proteins as cryptdin precursors was achieved by N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-TOF-MS. Peptide concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and the molecular masses of purified putative procryptdins were determined by MALDI-TOF-MS, followed by sequencing in the UCI Biomedical Protein and Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility. Recombinant procryptdin-1 and natural procryptdins were digested with MMP-7 and analyzed by AU-PAGE and SDS-PAGE, and mixtures of proteolytic digests from MMP-7 cleavage were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing. Samples (1 μg) of recombinant procryptdin-1 (21Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) and of natural procryptdins A–C purified from MMP-7-null mice were incubated with equimolar quantities of activated recombinant human MMP-7 catalytic domain (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 24 h at 37 °C. Reactions were analyzed on Tris/Tricine/SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Curiously, proregions or fragments of proregions were not seen by routine gel staining methods after digestion with MMP-7, even though procryptdins and cryptdin peptides stained well (see Fig.3 A). 2D. P. Satchell and A. J. Ouellette, unpublished data. Samples (∼200 ng) of complete digests were subjected to eight cycles of N-terminal peptide sequencing at the UCI Biomedical Protein and Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility. Proteins extracted from adult outbred Swiss mouse crypts were resolved by AU-PAGE, transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes, blocked, and incubated with sheep anti-cryptdin-1 prosegment immune IgG diluted 1:2000 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween containing 5% nonfat milk at room temperature with agitation (21Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Washed blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep antibody diluted 1:5000 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween for 30 min, washed, and developed using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) with a 10–15-min exposure (21Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). In Western blotting using rabbit anti-cryptdin-1 peptide antiserum, goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody at a 1:20,000 dilution (15Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). To measure bactericidal activities, ∼1 × 106 exponentially growing E. coli ML35 cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml synthetic cryptdin-3 or recombinant cryptdin-4 in 10 mmPIPES (pH 7.4) with quantities of prosegment, corresponding to preprocryptdin-1 residues 19–58 (see Fig. 1 A). After 60 min at 37 °C, 20 μl of each incubation mixture was diluted 1:2000 with 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.4), and 50 μl of the diluted samples was plated on trypticase soy agar using a Spiral Biotech Autoplate 4000 (Spiral Biotech, Inc., Bethesda, MD). Surviving bacteria were quantitated as colony-forming units/ml on plates after incubation at 37 °C for 12 h. A sheep polyclonal antibody raised against the full-length synthetic cryptdin-1 prosegment (Fig. 1 A) reacted specifically with procryptdin-1 and with procryptdins in extracts of mouse small intestine proteins (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed that the antibody was specific for procryptdins in intestinal protein extracts, which comigrated with recombinant procryptdin-1 (21Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Because mouse defensin family proregions have extensive sequence similarity (Fig.1 A), these data are probably a measure of immunoreactivity with procryptdin-1 and with the many defensin and defensin-related precursors expressed by mouse Paneth cells (33Ouellette A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2092985720,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is a pivotal early mediator of host defenses that is essential for survival in infections. We previously reported that exposing macrophages to febrile range temperatures (FRT) (38.5–40 °C) markedly attenuates TNFα expression by causing abrupt and premature cessation of transcription. We showed that this inhibitory effect of FRT is mediated by an alternatively activated repressor form of heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) and that a fragment of the TNFα gene comprising a minimal 85-nucleotide (nt) proximal promoter and the 138-nt 5′-untranslated region (UTR) was sufficient for mediating this effect. In the present study we have used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to identify a high affinity binding site for HSF-1 in the 5′-UTR of the TNFα gene and have used a chromosome immunoprecipitation assay to show that HSF-1 binds to this region of the endogenous TNFα gene. Mutational inactivation of this site blocks the inhibitory effect of overexpressed HSF-1 on activity of the minimal TNFα promoter (−85/+138) in Raw 264.7 murine macrophages, identifying this site as an HSF-1-dependent repressor. However, the same mutation fails to block repression of a full-length (−1080/+138) TNFα promoter construct by HSF-1 overexpression, and HSF-1 binds to upstream sequences in the regions −1080/−845, −533/−196, and −326/−39 nt in EMSA, suggesting that additional HSF-1-dependent repressor elements are present upstream of the minimal −85-nt promoter. Furthermore, although mutation of the HSF-1 binding site in the minimalTNFα promoter construct abrogates HSF-1-mediated repression, the same mutation fails to abrogate repression of this construct by high levels of HSF-1 overexpression or exposure to 39.5 °C. This suggests that HSF-1 might repress TNFα transcription through redundant mechanisms, some of which might not require high affinity binding of HSF-1.

HSF-1 is activated in response to various chemical and thermal stresses through a cascade of posttranslational modifications, including trimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and phosphorylation of its transactivation domain, the result being the activation of heat shock protein gene transcription (17Sorger P.K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas, in the case of urokinase and c-fos the effect apparently does not require stable DNA binding (22Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The minimal temperature-responsive TNFα gene sequence (−85/+138) was also inhibited by HSF-1 overexpression, but this sequence did not contain a complete cognate HSF-1 binding sequence. It does, however, contain multiple nGAAn elements positioned in critical locations, including adjacent to an essential Sp-1 binding site, at the transcription start site, and 35 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site. In the present study we have identified the high affinity binding site for HSF-1 in the minimal temperature-responsive TNFα gene sequence and showed that inactivating the site by mutation reverses the repression of this promoter fragment by HSF-1 overexpression. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD. Fig. 1 (see below) shows the sequences of each oligonucleotide used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized, annealed, and used as probe for EMSA. Primers for PCR-directed mutagenesis were Luc_5, 5′-ctttatgtttttggcgtcttca-3′ (5′ pGL3 backbone); Luc_3, 5′-ctagcaaaataggctgtccc-3′ (luciferase open reading frame); 49_Mut forward primer, 5′-ggggagaacagaaactccaccccatcttggaaatagctc-3′ and 49_Mut reverse primer, 5′-gagctatttccaagatggggtggagtttctgttctcccc3′, respectively. For EMSA spanning of the −1080 to −85 region of the TNFα gene sequence five partially overlapping PCR amplified fragments used as probes: I, −1080 to −845; II, −889 to −652; III, −686 to −494; IV, −533 to −196; and V, −326 to −39. The respective forward and reverse primers used for amplification were −1080/−845 (5′-ttggtccatgggatccg-3′ and 5′-ccccggtcttccaaggattcccctcccccaccctcc-3′), −889/−652 (5′-ttaggagtgggagggtggg-3′ and 5′-tcagccctgggaattcacggacctcac-3′), −686/−494 (5′-gaaggcttgtgaggtccgt-3′ and 5′-ggagacatgatattgaggag-3′), −533/−196 (5′-actcaaacagggggctttccctcctca-3′ and 5′-ggggacacccaggcatcaaggaatctctccccc-3′), and −326/−39 (5′-gtcctatacaacacacacac-3′ and 5′-tagcccttggggaagagggc-3′). The amplified PCR fragments were gel-purified and 32P-labeled for use as probe in EMSA. TNFα promoter-luciferase reporter constructs used in the study have been described earlier (15Singh I.S. Calderwood S. Kalvakolanu I. Viscardi R. Hasday J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9841-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Three constructs in the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI), namelypTNF −1080/+138 (−1080 to +138 nt),pTNF −244+138 (−244/+138 nt), andpTNF −85/+138 (−85/+138 nt), respectively, were used in this study. For mutated constructs, mutations were introduced into pTNF −1080/+138 plasmid (Mut-pTNF −1080/+138) using a modification of the overlap extension PCR method. In the first step, the 5′ and 3′ partially overlapping fragments containing the desired mutant were amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase. Outside primers Luc_5 and Luc_3 that correspond to flanking pGL3 backbone sequences and complementary internal primers (49_Mut forward and reverse primers), which generated a 36-nt overlap in the gene fragment and introduced a 3-base (GAA to CCC at +50 to +52 nt) substitution (see Fig. 4), were used for the amplification. Following first step PCR, the products were gel-purified and the second amplification was performed with equal concentrations of the two first step products as template and the outside primers Luc5 and Luc3 using Taq polymerase. The final product was digested with KpnI and HindIII, gel-purified, and cloned into the KpnI/HindIII site of pGL3. Mutated constructs corresponding topTNF −244/+138 and pTNF −85/+138(Mut-pTNF −244/+138 andMut-pTNF −85/+138, respectively) were prepared by amplifying the respective fragments fromMut-pTNF −1080/+138 using Taq polymerase and cloning the product into pGL3 vector as described earlier (15Singh I.S. Calderwood S. Kalvakolanu I. Viscardi R. Hasday J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9841-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by automated dideoxy sequencing (University of Maryland Biopolymer Core Laboratories). A glutathione S-transferase-human HSF-1 fusion construct in pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) was expressed and purified over a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fusion protein was cleaved using thrombin, and the purified HSF-1 protein was used in the study. The Raw 264.7 mouse macrophage cell line was purchased from the American Type Cell Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES buffer (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD), pH 7.3, and containing 10% defined fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum, HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in 5% CO2-enriched air. Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma infection using a commercial assay system (MycoTest, Invitrogen), and new cultures were established monthly from frozen stocks. All media and reagents contained less than 0.1 ng/ml endotoxin as determined byLimulus amebocyte lysate assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Falmouth, MA). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Cells were stimulated with LPS that was prepared by trichloroacetic acid precipitation from Escherichia coli0111:B4 (Difco, Detroit, MI). Nuclear extract from Raw cells were prepared according to the method of Schreiber et al. (23Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar) as we previously described (15Singh I.S. Calderwood S. Kalvakolanu I. Viscardi R. Hasday J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9841-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and total protein was measured using a commercial reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP according to the manufacturer's protocol. EMSA reactions containing 5 μg of nuclear extract or the indicated amount of recombinant HSF-1, 0.035 pmol of radiolabeled oligonucleotide, 1 μg of poly(dI/dC), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 60 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in volume of 20 μl were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Where indicated, excess unlabeled competitor double-stranded oligonucleotide or 1 μl of anti-HSF-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were incubated with the nuclear extracts for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The DNA·protein complexes were then electrophoretically resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were analyzed by phosphorimaging (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics) and subsequently exposed to x-ray film. ChIP assay was performed using a kit from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were provided in the kit. In brief, Raw 264.7 cells were incubated at 39.5 °C for 1 h and fixed by adding formaldehyde (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) to the medium to a final concentration of 1%. After 15 min the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml aprotinin and were collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer and sonicated for three 10-s bursts using a Branson Sonifier 450 (duty cycle and output settings were 30 and 3, respectively). Sonicated cell lysates were diluted 10-fold using ChIP dilution buffer and precleared for 1 h at 4 °C using 80 μl of a 50% salmon sperm DNA saturated protein A-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C overnight, and immune complexes were collected with salmon sperm DNA saturated protein A-agarose beads. Antibodies used included two rabbit anti-HSF-1 antibodies (from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and Stressgen) or, to control for nonspecific interaction, rabbit anti-IL-13 (R&D) or no antibody. After washing three times with immune complex wash buffer and twice with TE buffer, the complexes were eluted with 0.1 m NaHCO3 and 1% SDS. Protein-DNA cross-links were reverted by incubating at 65 °C for 4 h, and after proteinase K digestion, DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated using ethanol. PCR was performed (30 cycles, denaturing at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 63 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s) using primers specific for the murine TNFα sequence between −85 and +138: 5′-ggatcctgtgctagcttccgagggttgaatgaga (forward) and 5′-ttcgaagcttggagatgtgcgccttg (reverse). As a positive control, immunoprecipitated DNA was also amplified using PCR primers specific for an HRE-containing 180-nt fragment of the murineHSP70 promoter: 5′-aactccgattactcaagggaggc (forward) and 5′-gattctgagtagctgtcagcg (reverse) using the same PCR conditions as forTNFα except for a 60 °C annealing temperature. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 4 μg of each test plasmid and 0.5 μg of control (pRL-SV40, Promega) plasmid DNA were mixed with 15 μl of FuGENE 6 in 100 μl of medium. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then added to cells in 60-mm dishes. After 24 h, the cells were split into 24-well plates (1:12 per 60-mm plate). After an additional 24 h, the cells were stimulated with LPS at 37° or 39.5 °C for 6 h. Cells were lysed, and reporter gene expression was analyzed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences between two groups of data were analyzed using the unpaired Student t test. Differences among more than two groups were tested by applying the Fisher protected least significant differences test applied to a one-way analysis of variance. We previously reported that the murine TNFα gene sequence spanning −85 to +138 nt bound HSF-1 in EMSA competition assays and, when transfected into Raw 264.7 macrophages, conferred transcriptional repression by febrile range temperature (FRT; 39.5 °C) or HSF-1 overexpression (15Singh I.S. Calderwood S. Kalvakolanu I. Viscardi R. Hasday J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9841-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The high affinity binding sequence for HSF-1 comprises a minimum of two nGAAn elements arranged as an inverted dyad repeat (20Perisic O. Xiao H. Lis J.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 797-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Fig. 1 shows the location of nGAAn elements in the −85 to +138 nt region of the murineTNFα promoter (Fig. 1 C), the sequence of the heat shock response element (HRE) from the human HSP70 promoter (24Wu B.J. Kingston R.E. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B) and the sequences of each of the TNFα oligonucleotides used for the EMSA analysis of HSF-1 binding (Fig.1 C, underlined sequences). This fragment of theTNFα gene contains 10 nGAAn elements, but none arranged with perfect inverted dyad symmetry. Single nGAAn elements are positioned next to the Sp-1 binding site (−65 nt), at the transcription start site (−8 nt), and at nt +72 and +108 in the 5′-UTR. The 5′-UTR sequence spanning +30 to +68 contains an array of four nGAAn elements, three of which would form a perfect HRE if the “CT” sequence at nt +57 and +58 were inverted to “TC.” In our EMSA analysis, we probed with oligonucleotides spanning −83/−43 and containing three nGAAn elements and the Sp-1 binding sequence, −15/+5 containing one nGAAn and the transcription start site, +30/+68 and containing the imperfect HRE, and +65/+85 and +101/+121, each containing one nGAAn element. The capacity of each nGAAn-containing sequence in the minimal TNFα promoter/5′-UTR to bind HSF-1 was analyzed by EMSA using the oligonucleotides listed in Fig. 1 using the following three-step strategy. First, the capacity of a 100-fold excess of each oligonucleotide to compete and block HSF binding to a consensus HSF binding sequence was analyzed using the sequence from the humanHSP70 promoter as radiolabeled probe and nuclear extracts from Raw 264.7 macrophages exposed to 39.5 °C for 1 h as a source of HSF-1 (Fig. 2 A). Of the murine TNFα oligonucleotides analyzed, only +30/+68 blocked HSF-1 binding to the labeled HSP70 HRE sequence probe (Fig.2 A, lane 5). Competition for binding by thisTNFα oligonucleotide was as complete as that of a comparable concentration of the HSP70 sequence itself (lane 2). By comparison, each of the other TNFα oligonucleotides studied (lanes 3, 4,6, 7) failed to compete for HSF-1 binding. To confirm that HSF-1 binds with high affinity to the +30/+68TNFα sequence, we repeated the EMSA analysis using eachTNFα oligonucleotide as a radiolabeled EMSA probe (Fig.2 B). Of the TNFα sequences studied, only +30/+68 bound HSF-1 (lane 4), forming a complex that comigrated with the complex that formed on the HRE sequence from the HSP70 promoter (lane 1). Supershifting with anti-HSF-1 antibody (lane 7) confirmed that the observed complex contained HSF-1. To further confirm that HSF-1 could directly bind toTNFα +30/+68, we repeated the EMSA analysis with purified recombinant human HSF-1 (Fig. 3).TNFα +30/+68 bound rHSF-1 (lanes 7–10), but to a lesser degree than the HSP70 HRE (lanes 2–5). By comparison, the other TNFα sequence oligonucleotides failed to detectably bind rHSF-1 (data not shown).Figure 3EMSA analysis of recombinant HSF-1 binding to the HSF binding sequence from the human HSP70 promoter and TNFα oligonucleotide +30/+68.Radiolabeled oligonucleotide comprising the HSF binding sequence from the human HSP70 gene (HRE; lanes 1–5) or the TNFα +30/+68 sequence (lanes 6–10) was incubated with the indicated concentration of recombinant human HSF-1. The doublet bands representing the HSF·DNA complex are indicted by the arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The +30/+68 TNFα sequence contains four nGAAn sites that form two possible partially overlapping HREs centered on nt +49 and +59, respectively (Fig. 1 C). To further define the binding site for HSF-1 in this sequence we replaced the GAA sequences at either 50–52 nt (49_Mut) or 60–62 nt (59_Mut) with CCC (Fig.4 A) and analyzed the ability of the mutated +30/+68 oligonucleotides to bind HSF-1 in an EMSA competition assay (Fig. 4 B). Using the wild-type +30/+68 oligonucleotide as the radiolabeled probe and nuclear extracts from Raw 264.7 cells exposed to 39.5 °C for 1 h as a source of HSF-1, we found that unlabeled wild-type +30/+68 added at a 10-fold molar excess was sufficient to abrogate binding to radiolabeled +30/+68 (lane 2). Mutating the nGAAn sequence at +59 (59_Mut, lanes 9–12) did not change the capacity of +30/+68 to compete for HSF-1 binding. In striking contrast, 49_Mut failed to compete for HSF-1 binding when added at 10- to 100-fold excess (lanes 5–7) and only partially competed when added at 1000-fold excess (lane 8). Direct binding of HSF-1 to radiolabeled probe containing the wild-type and mutated +30/+68 sequences (Fig. 3 C) confirmed the results of the EMSA competition analysis. Although 59_Mut formed a complex (lane 4) similar to that formed on wild-type +30/+68 (lane 1), 49_Mut failed to bind HSF-1 under these conditions (lane 3). We extended these observations by introducing the GAA to CCC substitution at +50/−52 into the full-lengthTNFα promoter/5′-UTR (−1080/+138) sequence and analyzing HSF-1 binding to a PCR-amplified −85/+138 fragment of the wild-type and mutated gene (Fig. 5). EMSA was performed by using each PCR product as radiolabeled probe, and nuclear extracts from Raw 264.7 cells exposed to 39.5 °C for 1 h as a source of HSF-1. The wild-type TNFα PCR product formed a complex (lane 1) that was competed for by unlabeled wild-type +30/+68 oligonucleotide (lane 3) but not by 49_Mut oligonucleotide (lane 4) and was supershifted by anti-HSF-1 antibody (lane 5). In contrast, the comparableTNFα sequence containing the GAA to CCC mutation at +50/−52 failed to form a detectable complex (lane 2). Thus, it appears that the HRE-like sequence centered on nt +49 in the 5′-UTR is the only site in the minimal promoter/5′-UTR sequence (−85/+138) that forms high affinity complexes with HSF-1 under these cell-free assay conditions. Although we have demonstrated that HSF-1 binds to naked DNA under artificial cell-free conditions, its ability to repress TNFα transcription in the cell requires it to bind to the endogenous TNFα genein vivo. We used the ChIP assay to determine if HSF-1 binds to the TNFα gene in vivo in Raw 264.7 cells incubated at 39.5 °C for 60 min. DNA was sonicated to yield fragments of ∼500-nt length. PCR with primers specific for the HRE-containing murine HSP70 promoter sequence amplified detectable product of the predicted 180-nt length in samples immunoprecipitated with each of the anti-HSF-1 antibodies (Fig.6, lanes 3, 4), whereas no PCR product was detectable in samples immunoprecipitated without antibody (lane 5) or with an irrelevant rabbit anti-IL-13 antibody (lane 2), thereby validating the ChIP assay in this model. PCR amplification using primers specific for theTNFα sequence spanning −85 to +138, which includes the putative HSF-1 binding site, generated a detectable product of the predicted 223-nt length in samples immunoprecipitated with the anti-HSF-1 antibodies (Fig. 6, lanes 8, 9) but not in samples immunoprecipitated without antibody (lane 10) or with anti-IL-13 antibody (lane 7). The functional significance of abrogating high affinity HSF-1 binding to the TNFα 5′-UTR in comparison with transcriptional repression was analyzed by introducing the GAA to CCC mutation at nt 50–52 into each of threeTNFα promoter-driven luciferase reporter constructs: 1) the minimal promoter/5′-UTR (pTNF −85/+138) (Fig. 7 A); 2) a 382-nt promoter/5′-UTR fragment (pTNF −244/+138) containing the most proximal NF-κB response element (Fig.7 B); and 3) a full-length 1.2-kb promoter/5′-UTR fragment (pTNF −1080/+138) (Fig. 7 C). Each of these promoter fragments was cloned into the NheI/HindIII site of pGL3, transiently transfected into Raw 264.7 cells, and the promoter activity was compared in 37° and 39.5 °C cell cultures and in the presence of increasing concentrations of an HSF-1 expression plasmid at 37 °C (15Singh I.S. Calderwood S. Kalvakolanu I. Viscardi R. Hasday J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9841-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The analysis was performed in both the presence and absence of LPS. Although TNFα promoter activity was higher in the presence of LPS, the pattern of FRT- and HSF-1-induced effects on wild-type and mutated TNFα reporter constructs was comparable in LPS-stimulated and unstimulated cells. The data from the LPS-stimulated cells are shown. HSF-1 overexpression reduced the activity of both wild-typepTNF −1080/+138(Fig. 7 C) andpTNF −85/+138(Fig. 7 A), as we have previously reported (15Singh I.S. Calderwood S. Kalvakolanu I. Viscardi R. Hasday J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9841-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and similarly reduced the activity of pTNF −244/+138(Fig. 7 B). Mutation of the high affinity HSF-1 binding site (at nt +50/−52) in pTNF −85/+138 seemed to interfere with the inhibitory effect of HSF-1 overexpression (Fig.7 A). At 1 and 2 μg of HSF-1 expression plasmid, the activity of the wild-type pTNF −85/+138 construct was decreased by 28 and 40%, respectively; whereas, activity of the mutant construct was unchanged. However, cotransfection with 3 μg of HSF-1 plasmid or incubation at 39.5 °C inhibited the activity of the wild-type and mutated pTNF −85/+138 construct by a similar extent. HSF-1 overexpression inhibited both wild-type and mutatedpTNF −244/+138 (Fig. 7 B), but the extent of inhibition of the mutated construct was significantly less than that of the wild-type construct at 2 μg (22 versus 42%;p < 0.05) and 3 μg of HSF-1 plasmid (36versus 59%; p < 0.05). Both constructs were inhibited to a similar extent by exposing cells to 39.5 °C. In contrast, in the full-length promoter (pTNF −1080/+138, Fig. 7 C), mutation of the high affinity HSF-1 binding site in the 5′-UTR had no detectable effect on the inhibitory effects of HSF-1 overexpression or exposure to 39.5 °C. The transfection results suggested that additional HSF-1-responsive repressor elements might be present in theTNFα sequence upstream of the minimal promoter. To determine if HSF-1 binds to sequences upstream of −85, we prepared five partially overlapping fragments by PCR amplification spanning the region −39 to −1080. The amplified fragments were radiolabeled and used as a probe in EMSA using purified rHSF-1 (Fig.8). The PCR fragments −1080/−845 (235 bp, lane 1), −533/−196 (337 bp, lane 4), and −326/−39 (287 bp, lane 5) formed complexes with rHSF-1, whereas fragments −889/−652 (237 bp, lane 2) and −686/−494 (192 bp, lane 3) failed to form any detectable complex with rHSF-1. In our earlier studies, we showed that TNFα expression is reduced in human and murine macrophages upon exposure to febrile temperature (10Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ensor J.E. Wiener S.M. McCrea K.A. Viscardi R.M. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and that the effect is largely caused by a reduction in TNFα transcription in the warmer cells. We showed that exposing Raw 264.7 cells to febrile range temperature (39.5 °C) activates the heat stress-activated transcription factor HSF-1, but although HSF-1 in the 39.5 °C cell culture binds to its cognate DNA binding site, it fails to activate transcription from the HSP70 promoter. We showed that HSF-1 activation correlates with cessation of TNFα transcription in 39.5 °C Raw 264.7 cell culture and HSF-1 overexpression reduces TNFα promoter activity in 37 °C Raw 264.7 cell culture. Together, these data offered a persuasive argument that HSF-1 might act as a repressor of macrophage TNFα expression during exposure to febrile temperatures. This hypothesis was further supported by the studies of Xiao et al. (25Xiao X. Zuo X. Davis A.A. McMillan D.R. Curry B.B. Richardson J.A. Benjamin I.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) who showed that HSF-1 knockout mice demonstrated exaggerated TNFα expression following challenge with LPS compared with HSF-1-sufficient littermates. We previously showed that HSF-1 binds to the murine TNFα proximal promoter/5′-UTR sequence spanning nt −85 to +138 under EMSA conditions. We have extended these findings in our present study by localizing the HSF-1 binding site between nt +30 and 68 in the 5′-UTR of the murine TNFα gene. The sequence between nt +49 and +58, AGAACATCTT, with the exception of a simple inversion of the 3′-terminal CT dinucleotide (underlined), is the canonical HSF-1 binding sequence. We used EMSA analysis to show that this sequence specifically binds HSF-1 and that mutation of the nGAAn pentanucleotide at nt +49/+53 prevents binding of HSF-1, whereas the same substitution in a downstream GAAn sequence (nt +60/−62) had no effect on HSF-1 binding. However, the inability of DNA·protein complexes to form under EMSA conditions does not necessarily exclude an interaction in vivo. To provide further evidence that HSF-1 might bind to and repress theTNFα gene in vivo, we using the ChIP assay to determine if HSF-1 interacts with the TNFα gene in the living cell. We incubated Raw 264.7 cells for 1 h at 39.5 °C, conditions that we have shown activate HSF-1 to a form that binds HSP70 promoter and TNFα gene sequences under cell-free EMSA conditions. We showed that two different anti-HSF-1 antibodies coimmunoprecipitated both HRE-containing HSP70 promoter sequence and TNFα sequence containing the putative HSF-1 binding site. Negative controls, immunoprecipitated without antibody or with an irrelevant antibody (anti-IL-13) from the same species (rabbit), did not contain detectable HSP70 orTNFα gene fragments demonstrating the specificity of the technique. In transient transfection studies, the TNF−85/+138 reporter construct containing a GAA to CCC substitution at nt +50/−52 was significantly less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of overexpressed HSF-1 than was the wild-type construct. In fact, cotransfection of this mutated construct with 1 or 2 μg of HSF-1 expression plasmid had no inhibitory effect on luciferase activity whereas the wild-type construct was inhibited by 30–40% when cotransfected with the same amount of HSF-1 expression plasmid. These data suggest that HSF-1 represses transcription from the minimal TNFα promoter/5′-UTR fragment, in part, by binding to the HRE-like sequence at +49/−58 nt within the 5′-UTR. The capacity of elements within the 5′-UTR region of genes to repress transcription has been reported to occur in other genes, including the collagen α1 gene and the potassium channel Kv3.1 gene (26Hernandez I. de la Torre P. Rey-Campos J. Garcia I. Sanchez J.A. Munoz R. Rippe R.A. Munoz-Yague T. Solis-Herruzo J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Gan L. Hahn S.J. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1350-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Based on the location of the putative repressor site in the murine TNFα gene, only 30–60 nt downstream of the transcription start site, HSF-1 might repress TNFα transcription by blocking RNA polymerase processivity, as has been shown in the phage T7 model system in which binding of the lac repressor 13–15 nucleotides downstream of the initiation site blocks T7 RNA polymerase processivity (28Lopez P.J. Guillerez J. Sousa R. Dreyfus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 861-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cotransfection with 3 μg of HSF-1 or incubation at 39.5 °C caused comparable reductions in activity of the mutated and wild-type TNF−85/+138 reporter constructs. The capacity of higher HSF-1 levels to repress the TNF−85/+138 construct containing the mutation at +50/+52 suggests that there might be additional pathways through which HSF-1 represses expression of the minimal TNFα promoter. These include lower affinity binding of HSF-1 to non-canonical HSF-1 binding sites elsewhere in this gene fragment that is not detected by EMSA yet still might block transcription complex formation. Alternatively, HSF-1 might repressTNFα transcription without directly binding to DNA. Chenet al. (22Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have suggested that HSF-1 could interact either with an upstream signal transduction component or with a coactivating factor to specifically repress genes such as c-fos and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. In contrast to the minimal TNFα promoter, the full-length 1.2-kb TNFα promoter construct was comparably inhibited by 1–3 μg of HSF-1, and this inhibition was unaffected by the presence or absence of the GAA to CCC mutation at +50/+52. The intermediate length construct, TNF−244/+138, exhibited a third pattern of responsiveness to the GAA to CCC mutation at +50/−52 and to overexpression of HSF-1. The activity of the wild-type and mutatedTNF−244/+138 was comparably inhibited by the lowest HSF-1 expression but, when cotransfected with 2 and 3 μg of HSF-1 expression plasmid, the wild-type construct was inhibited to a greater extent than the mutated construct. On the other hand, exposure to 39.5 °C reduced the activity of all three constructs, and the repression was unaffected by mutational inactivation of the HSF-1 binding site at nt +49/+58. The different patterns of response of each of the three constructs to HSF-1 overexpression and the mutational inactivation of the HSF-1 binding site at nt +49/−58 suggest that additional sequences upstream of nt −85 might mediate transcriptional repression by HSF-1. Using overlapping ∼200-nt PCR-generated fragments of TNFα upstream sequence, the sequence upstream of nt −85 was scanned for HSF-1 binding. Complex formation with rHSF-1 was detectable to the regions −1080/−845, −533/−196, and −326/−39 suggesting that redundant HSF-1 binding sites might be active in the TNFα gene. Alternatively, or in addition to direct binding to DNA, HSF-1 might interfere with transcription by binding to transcriptional activators as has been shown for STAT (29Stephanou A. Isenberg D.A.

In summary, we identified a unique HRE-like sequence in the murineTNFα 5′-UTR that binds HSF-1 and is required for HSF-1-mediated transcriptional repression in the minimal mouseTNFα promoter. This offers proof of the concept that HSF-1 can repress gene transcription by binding to the 5′-UTR. Although the 5′-UTR HRE-like sequence of the mouse TNFα gene is not present in the human TNFα 5′-UTR, the results of this study suggest a number of additional redundant pathways through which exposure to febrile range temperature might inhibit transcription of both murine and human TNFα.

In this study, focusing on the axons of the mouse sciatic nerve, we found that HNE adducts characterize axons of mice from birth to senility. Immunoblots of axonal proteins showed that HNE adducts are only detected in neurofilament heavy subunit (NFH) and, to a lesser extent, neurofilament medium subunit (NFM), both lysine-rich proteins, consistent with the adducts being limited to lysine residues. <i>In vitro</i>, HNE treatment of permeabilized sciatic nerve showed the same specificity, <i>i.e.</i> NFH and NFM are the only proteins that reacted with HNE, providing they are phosphorylated. Quantitative immunoblot analysis of two strains of mice ages 1–33 months showed that the levels of HNE adducts on NFH are consistent throughout life. Additionally, mice transgenic for human superoxide dismutase-1 with G85R mutation show no difference in HNE adduction to NFH compared with controls. Taken together, these studies indicate that HNE adduction to NFH is physiological, and its constancy from birth to senility as well as its dependence on phosphorylation argues that NFH and NFM modification may play a role in protecting the membrane-rich axon from toxic aldehydes resulting from oxidative damage."

The myotubularin gene, MTM1, is mutated in the genetic disorder, X-linked myotubular myopathy. We and others have previously shown that myotubularin utilizes the lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), as a physiologic substrate. We demonstrate here that the myotubularin-related protein MTMR2, which is mutated in the neurodegenerative disorder, type 4B Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, is also highly specific for PI(3)P as a substrate. Furthermore, the MTM-related phosphatases MTMR1, MTMR3, and MTMR6 also dephosphorylate PI(3)P, suggesting that activity toward this substrate is common to all myotubularin family enzymes. A direct comparison of the lipid phosphatase activities of recombinant myotubularin and MTMR2 demonstrates that their enzymatic properties are indistinguishable, indicating that the lack of functional redundancy between these proteins is likely to be due to factors other than the utilization of different physiologic substrates. To this end, we have analyzed myotubularin and MTMR2 transcripts during induced differentiation of cultured murine C2C12 myoblasts and find that their expression is divergently regulated. In addition, myotubularin and MTMR2 enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion proteins exhibit overlapping but distinct patterns of subcellular localization. Finally, we provide evidence that myotubularin, but not MTMR2, can modulate the levels of endosomal PI(3)P.

Our laboratory and others have previously shown that myotubularin specifically dephosphorylates the D3 position of the inositol lipid, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) (9Taylor G.S.

Recent reports have also shown that MTMR3 and MTMR4 (also referred to as FYVE-DSP1 and FYVE-DSP2, respectively) can utilize PI(3)P as a substrate (11Zhao R. Qi Y. Chen J. Zhao Z.J. Exp.

Together, these findings suggest that all of the active MTM family members may function to regulate cellular PI(3)P levels.

In addition to MTM1 mutations identified in X-linked myotubular myopathy, a second MTM-related gene has been associated with a human genetic disease. Mutations in theMTMR2 gene are causative for the neurodegenerative disorder, type 4B Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndrome, which is a hereditary demyelinating peripheral neuropathy that results from improper Schwann cell development (21Bolino A.

Patients with type 4B CMT exhibit abnormal focally folded myelin in the neural sheath (21Bolino A. Brancolini V. Bono F. Bruni A. Gambardella A. Romeo G. Quattrone A. Devoto M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The difference in the pathologies of myotubular myopathy and type 4B CMT are particularly intriguing in light of the fact that MTM1 and MTMR2 are both expressed in adult skeletal muscle and neuronal tissues and are highly similar (64% identity, 76% similarity) (24Laporte J. Blondeau F. Buj-Bello A. Tentler D. Kretz C. Dahl N. Mandel J.-L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1703-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although their specific physiologic roles are not known, it is clear from the different pathologies manifested in myotubular myopathy and CMT disease that MTM1 and MTMR2 are not functionally redundant. The lack of functional overlap between these proteins may have several possible explanations. Although they are highly similar at the protein level, MTM1 and MTMR2 may have distinct substrate preferences. Alternatively, although they are expressed in both adult skeletal muscle and neuronal tissues, MTM1 and MTMR2 may play important roles during specific developmental stages and thus be expressed differentially during maturation of specific tissues. Finally, they may both act on PI(3)P but be localized to distinct subcellular compartments, thus regulating different cellular pools of this lipid. Consistent with this notion, a recent study has demonstrated that PI(3)P can be detected at multiple discrete sites within internal vesicular structures, including endosomes and endosomal carrier vesicles as well as the nucleolus (25Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have undertaken the enzymatic characterization of MTM family phosphatases to determine whether utilization of the inositol lipid, PI(3)P, as a substrate is common among these enzymes. As a first step toward understanding the molecular basis of MTM function in the human genetic disorders, myotubular myopathy and type 4B CMT, we have also conducted a detailed comparison of the enzymatic properties of recombinant MTM1 and MTMR2. Our results demonstrate that like MTM1, MTMR2 can act on PI(3)P, providing a direct link between inositol lipid regulation and type 4B CMT. In addition, we have analyzed the subcellular localization and expression of MTM1 and MTMR2 during myogenic differentiation to determine whether these factors might contribute to their functional regulation. Finally, we present evidence that MTM1 and MTMR2 are likely to act on distinct cellular pools of PI(3)P.

Recombinant GST-2×FYVE protein was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells and purified over glutathione-agarose affinity resin. Briefly, cells harboring the pGEX-2×FYVE plasmid were grown in 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 of 0.7, and then protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml (each) aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (30 ml of lysis buffer per liter of cultured cells). The cells were disrupted by sonication, and Triton X-100 was added to 0.5% (v/v). The crude lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 × g to remove unbroken cells and insoluble debris. The soluble fraction was incubated with glutathione-agarose affinity resin (1 ml of 50% slurry in PBS/liter of culture) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times for 5 min each with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, followed by two 5-min washes in lysis buffer without detergent. The GST-2×FYVE fusion protein was eluted from the resin for 2 × 30 min with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm reduced glutathione (pH 7.4) and filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter. Free glutathione was removed by gel filtration chromatography in PBS using a Superdex 200 column and FPLC chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.).

Phosphatase assays with bacterial recombinant MTM1, MTMR1, MTMR2, and MTMR6 using synthetic di-C8-phosphoinositide or soluble inositol phosphate substrates were carried out at 30 °C, and phosphate release was determined using a malachite green-based assay system for inorganic phosphate as described (28Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The artificial protein phosphatase substrates myelin basic protein and casein were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP on tyrosyl or seryl/threonyl residues and used as substrates for recombinant MTM1 and MTMR2 as previously described (9Taylor G.S. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells with TRIzol reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). RNA samples (15 μg) were then electrophoresed through a 1% agarose-formaldelyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The blots were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled probes, and mRNAs corresponding to murine MTM1 and MTMR2 were detected using a digoxigenin chemiluminescence detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A murine MTM1 cDNA probe corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region (283 bp) was amplified by PCR using expressed sequence tag clone AW911959 (Research Genetics/Invitrogen) as a template. A cDNA probe corresponding to the murine MTMR2 5′-region (nucleotides −5 to +381) was amplified by PCR using expressed sequence tag clone AI561725 (Research Genetics/Invitrogen) as a template. COS-1 cells were seeded on two-chamber slides (21 × 21 mm) at a density of 5 × 104cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cultured as described above. After attachment (∼8 to 12 h), the cells were transiently transfected using Fugene 6 reagent as described above. At 30 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted on the slides using ProLong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For analyses with biotinylated GST-2×FYVE as a probe for PI(3)P, a modified form of a protocol developed in the laboratory of Dr. Harald Stenmark at the Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Cancer Research, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway, was used. 2H. Stenmark, personal communication.Briefly, COS-1 cells were cultured and transfected on chambered microscope slides as described above. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were washed and fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, which permeabilizes most of the cells. The cells were washed once in PBS, then the free aldehyde groups were quenched by incubation with PBS containing 50 mmNH4Cl for 15 min at room temperature. All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. The slides were incubated for 1 h with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS as a blocking agent. Next, the slides were incubated with 3% fetal calf serum in PBS containing 50 μg/ml biotinylated GST-2×FYVE for 30 min. The slides were washed for 3 × 5 min with PBS. The slides were then incubated for 30 min with 1 μg/ml Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS containing 3% fetal calf serum. Finally, the slides were washed three times for 5 min each with PBS and mounted using ProLong mounting medium. Fluorescence analyses were performed by conventional fluorescence microscopy or by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510) as indicated. The association of MTM1 and MTMR2 with the respective genetic disorders myotubular myopathy and type 4B Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome is of significant interest because although they are highly similar proteins and exhibit overlapping expression patterns in human tissues, they do not appear to be functionally redundant (2Laporte J.

As a first step toward understanding the functional differences between MTM1 and MTMR2, we analyzed their enzymatic properties to determine whether they possessed similar activity and/or substrate specificity. Recombinant MTM1 and MTMR2 fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and their phosphatase activity was tested toward a panel of substrates including phosphoinositides, soluble inositol phosphates, and radiolabeled artificial protein substrates. As shown in Table I, the activity of MTMR2 was indistinguishable from that of MTM1 over the panel of substrates tested. Both enzymes dephosphorylated PI(3)P >50-fold more efficiently than any other substrate, demonstrating that they are highly specific for this lipid (Table I). Although MTM1 and MTMR2 were able to dephosphorylate the PI(3)P soluble headgroup analog, inositol 1,3-bisphosphate, their activity with this substrate was 10-fold lower than with PI(3)P, indicating a strong preference for the lipid as a substrate. Neither enzyme exhibited significant activity toward artificial protein substrates phosphorylated on tyrosyl or seryl/threonyl residues, confirming that they are extremely poor protein phosphatases. Most importantly, because the truncatingMTMR2 mutations first associated with type 4B CMT syndrome would cause loss of MTMR2 phosphatase activity, our findings suggest that this disorder, like myotubular myopathy, results from the failure to regulate cellular PI(3)P levels (9Taylor G.S.

Furthermore, these data indicate that the lack of functional redundancy between MTM1 and MTMR2 is not due to differences in their catalytic properties or substrate specificity.Table IPhosphatase activity of recombinant myotubularin and MTMR2Substrate1-aPI, phosphatidylinositol; P2, bisphosphate; P3, trisphosphate; P4, tetraphosphate; MBP, myelin basic protein.ConcentrationSpecific activityMTM1-H6MTMR2-H6μmmol min−1 mol−1p-Nitrophenol phosphate50,0004459PI(3)P5022262281PI(4)P501016PI(5)P504648PI(3,4)P2501301-bLimit of detection in these assays was 10 pmol of phosphate released.PI(3,5)P25001-bLimit of detection in these assays was 10 pmol of phosphate released.01-bLimit of detection in these assays was 10 pmol of phosphate released.PI(4,5)P25001-bLimit of detection in these assays was 10 pmol of phosphate released.01-bLimit of detection in these assays was 10 pmol of phosphate released.PI(3,4,5)P35001-bLimit of detection in these assays was 10 pmol of phosphate released.10Ins(4)P5001-bLimit of detection in these assays was 10 pmol of phosphate released.01-bLimit of detection in these assays was 10 pmol of phosphate released.Ins(1,3)P250206232Ins(1,4)P25001-bLimit of detection in these assays was 10 pmol of phosphate released.2Ins(1,3,4)P35034Ins(1,4,5)P35001-bLimit of detection in these assays was 10 pmol of phosphate released.01-bLimit of detection in these assays was 10 pmol of phosphate released.Ins(1,3,4,5)P45022Tyr(P)-MBP5.00.0180.015Tyr(P)-casein5.00.1060.055Ser(P)/Tyr(P)-MBP5.00.00040.0009Ser(P)-casein5.00.00020.0006Phosphatase assays using purified recombinant MTM1 and MTMR2 proteins were carried out at 30 °C with the indicated amount of substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The specific activities shown are expressed as mol of phosphate released/min/mol of enzyme and represent the mean of triplicate determinations.

TTF-1, also termed Nkx2.1, is a member of the Nkx family of transcription factors that bind an element termed the NKE, containing 5′-TNAAGTG-3′, found in regulatory regions of target genes (12Damante G.

These elements are required for the activity of the surfactant promoters. TTF-1 directly activates gene expression when expressed in non-respiratory epithelial cells. There is increasing evidence that TTF-1 functions cooperatively with a number of other transcription factors, forming complexes on regulatory regions of target genes.

Depending on the sites and context of elements within target genes, TTF-1 can act directly or cooperatively with these various factors to regulate gene expression. Whether these interactions are mediated by direct interactions among the transcription factors, or in DNA complexes with other transcription factors, is unclear at present.GATA-6 is a member of a family of nuclear transcription factors that binds to GATA containing cis-acting elements via highly conserved zinc finger domains. The GATA family includes two distinct groups of proteins as follows: GATA-1, -2, and -3 are involved in hematopoietic cell differentiation and gene expression; and GATA-4, -5, and -6 influence endodermally and mesodermally derived tissues, including lung and heart (16Dimaline R.

Because all GATA family members share the same highly conserved DNA-binding domain and consensus binding element, WGATAR, the functional specificity of GATA family members is thought to be mediated by collaboration with other transcription factors or co-factors to activate transcription of target genes (22Durocher D.

For example, in cardiac tissues, GATA-4 is co-expressed with Nkx2.5 (Tinman) in early cardiac progenitor cells (25Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that only GATA-4, but not GATA-6 or GATA-1, directly interacts and synergizes Nkx2.5 activity.In previous studies (27Shaw-White J.R. Bruno M.D. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2658-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), GATA-6 was found to bind to elements in the 5′-flanking region of the ttf-1 gene, enhancingttf-1 gene transcription. The temporal-spatial expression patterns of GATA-6 and TTF-1 overlap in the developing lung and coincide with the sites of expression of surfactant protein, including SP-C (28Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Recent studies (29Glasser S.W. Burhans M.S. Korfhagen T.R. Na C.L. Sly P.D. Ross G.F. Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6366-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) demonstrated the critical role of surfactant protein-C in surfactant function and pathogenesis of hereditary interstitial lung disease. Likewise, GATA-6 activatedsp-A gene transcription in vitro (5Bruno M.D. Korfhagen T.R. Liu C. Morrisey E.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1043-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The present study was therefore undertaken to test whether GATA-6 influences the activity of the surfactant protein-C promoter and whether GATA-6 and TTF-1 might directly interact via protein-protein interactions. The present study demonstrates physical interactions between GATA-6 and TTF-1 and their synergistic effects on the transcription of the mousesp-C promoter.DISCUSSIONGATA-6 and TTF-1 synergistically stimulated the activity of the surfactant protein C promoter. Direct interaction of the two transcription factors was observed by co-precipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assays. The binding interaction was dependent upon the homeodomain region of TTF-1 and the amino-terminal and zinc finger domains of GATA-6. Whereas the zinc finger domains of GATA-4 and GATA-6 were highly conserved, the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain of GATA-6 conferred more active synergistic activation of thesp-C promoter in the presence of TTF-1. Direct interactions between TTF-1 and GATA-6, and their co-expression during morphogenesis of the lung, support the concept that protein-protein interactions between these members of the distinct transcription proteins may play a role in the expression of target genes in the respiratory epithelium.Whereas neither GATA-6 nor TTF-1 expression is confined to the lung during development, these transcription factors are co-expressed only in peripheral respiratory epithelial cells of the developing lung, where they cooperatively activated the expression of thesp-C promoter. The sites of co-expression are also consistent with the cell-selective expression of pro-SP-C and other surfactant proteins, including surfactant proteins A and B. TTF-1 is expressed in the forebrain and thyroid and does not overlap with the expression pattern of GATA-6 in these non-respiratory tissues (32Bingle C.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1471-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). TTF-1 and GATA-6 were also co-expressed in MLE-15 cells, consistent with previous findings demonstrating the requirement of TTF-1 for the expression of surfactant proteins in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to TTF-1, GATA-6 was not sufficient for activation of sp-C gene expression in HeLa cells; however, the two proteins synergistically activated the sp-Cpromoter, demonstrating distinct roles of the GATA-6 and TTF-1 elements within the mouse sp-C promoter. Consensus elements for the binding sites for GATA-6 (−152 to −148 and −42 to −39) and TTF-1 (−197 to −158) are present on the mouse sp-C promoter, consistent with the ability of each protein to bind directly at their cis-active elements (6Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The close apposition of the NKE and GATA elements in the sp-C promoter also supports possible direct and indirect interactions between these two factors within thesp-C promoter.Studies in the cardiac specific gene expression and the expression of atrial natriuretic factor have provided precedents for the interaction between GATA and Nkx family members (22Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 (tinman) synergistically activated cardiac α-actin gene expression in vitro, and direct interactions between the two proteins were observed in in vitro co-precipitation assays (25Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The interactions between Nkx2.5 and GATA-4 were also dependent upon the zinc finger domain in GATA-4 and the homeodomain of the Nkx2.5, findings similar to those presently observed between TTF-1 and GATA-6. These data and others studies (23Holmes M. Turner J. Fox A. Chisholm O. Crossley M. Chong B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23491-23498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Huggins G.S. Bacani C.J. Boltax J. Aikawa R. Leiden J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20762-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) support the role of zinc finger domain as a protein-protein interaction domain.Because the zinc finger of GATA-6 mediated both DNA binding and interaction with TTF-1, the nature of these interactions was assessed by substitution mutations, exchanging the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger of GATA-4 for that of GATA-6 by insertion of G646. Whereas this GATA-6 mutant maintained DNA binding activity to the consensus GATA site, its ability to activate the sp-C promoter in a synergistic manner was decreased. The loss of synergy of the GATA-6 (G646) mutant with TTF-1 is likely mediated by impaired interactions between TTF-1 and the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain of GATA-6 rather than by changes in DNA binding, because the DNA binding domain is intact. However, both pVPGATA-4 and pVPG646 interacted with TTF-1 in the two-hybrid assay. Thus, the activity of GATA-6 to bind to TTF-1 was not directly correlated with the ability to stimulate synergistically thesp-C promoter, suggesting multiple mechanisms by which GATA-6 may influence its activity.Because TTF-1 is known to interact with a number of other transcription factors with binding sites located in close proximity to the NKEs, TTF-1 and GATA-6 are likely to interact in complex ways at both cis-acting elements with each other and with other protein partners within complexes in the promoters of the target gene. TTF-1 binds and interacts with BR22, RARs, and CBP/P300 in complexes involved in the activation of the sp-B gene promoter (15Yang Y.S. Yang M.C. Wang B. Weissler J.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Likewise, TTF-1 binds and synergistically activates the sp-C promoter with nuclear factor-1, binding at sites located −307 to −91, in close proximity to both GATA-6 and TTF-1-binding sites.2 Because GATA-6, TTF-1, NF1, RARs, and other co-factors change developmentally, and may also influence histone acetylation, distinct transcriptional complex may serve to regulate target gene expression during lung development. Furthermore, cis-active elements binding AP-1, NF1, and CREB overlap with the NKE sites in various surfactant protein promoter elements. Interestingly, although GATA-4 interacts with TTF-1, it does not synergistically activate the mouse sp-C promoter in HeLa cells as well as GATA-6, suggesting that the binding is not sufficient for synergy between GATA and Nkx family members. Activation by GATA-6 or GATA-4 may be mediated by various mechanisms, including direct binding to GATA elements or by the formation of transcription complexes mediated by direct or indirect interactions between TTF-1 and GATA-6 or among TTF-1, GATA-6, and other transcription factors.Both GATA-6 and TTF-1 play important but distinct roles in lung morphogenesis and gene expression. TTF-1 is required for the formation of the lung periphery during lung morphogenesis.ttf-1(−/−) mice have severely hypoplastic lung rudiments, lacking peripheral lung parenchyma at birth (10Minoo P. Su G. Drum H. Bringas P. Kimura S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar).

GATA-6 is required for endoderm formation per se, and targeted deletion of GATA-6 was lethal early during embryogenesis before lung bud formation (36Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F.

Whether these distinct effects of GATA-6 on surfactant protein B and C gene transcription contribute to distinct patterns of expression of pro-SP-B and pro-SP-C in the developing lung remain to be discerned.Thus, TTF-1 and GATA-6 interact in complex ways at cis-active elements of target genes. TTF-1 and GATA-6 bind directly to NKE and GATA elements, located in close proximity within the surfactant protein C promoter. GATA-6 and TTF-1 can directly interact through the zinc finger domain of GATA-6 and the homeodomain of TTF-1. Furthermore, TTF-1 forms complexes with other transcription factors, including NF1, RARs, and co-factors, to influence the activity of the surfactant protein C promoter. Lung structure and respiratory epithelial cell gene expression are determined by the actions of a number of nuclear transcription factors, including members of homeodomain, Forkhead, and zinc finger families of proteins (1Costa R.H.

Members of these families of transcription factors are expressed in the foregut endoderm during lung morphogenesis and in subsets of respiratory epithelial cells later in development, where they influence the expression of genes selectively expressed in the lung, including surfactant proteins SP-A, -B, -C, and Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP)1(3Di Bohinski R.J.

Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), a member of the family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors, plays a critical role in both lung morphogenesis and in respiratory epithelial cell gene expression. TTF-1 is required for the transcription of surfactant proteins and for the formation and differentiation of epithelial cells lining the peripheral respiratory tract (3Di Bohinski R.J. Lauro R.

TTF-1, also termed Nkx2.1, is a member of the Nkx family of transcription factors that bind an element termed the NKE, containing 5′-TNAAGTG-3′, found in regulatory regions of target genes (12Damante G. Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Civitareale D. Guazzi S. Polycarpou-Schwartz M. Cauci S. Quadrifoglio F. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3075-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Multiple NKEs have been identified and their function defined in the surfactant protein and CCSP gene promoters. These elements are required for the activity of the surfactant promoters. TTF-1 directly activates gene expression when expressed in non-respiratory epithelial cells. There is increasing evidence that TTF-1 functions cooperatively with a number of other transcription factors, forming complexes on regulatory regions of target genes. TTF-1 interacts with retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and associated cofactors (13Yan C. Naltner A. Conkright J. Ghaffari M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21686-21691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), nuclear factor-1, 2C. Bachurski, unpublished observations.2C. Bachurski, unpublished observations. AP1 family members (14Sever-Chroneos Z. Bachurski C.J. Yan C. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L79-L88PubMed Google Scholar), and BR22 (15Yang Y.S. Yang M.C. Wang B. Weissler J.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Depending on the sites and context of elements within target genes, TTF-1 can act directly or cooperatively with these various factors to regulate gene expression. Whether these interactions are mediated by direct interactions among the transcription factors, or in DNA complexes with other transcription factors, is unclear at present. GATA-6 is a member of a family of nuclear transcription factors that binds to GATA containing cis-acting elements via highly conserved zinc finger domains. The GATA family includes two distinct groups of proteins as follows: GATA-1, -2, and -3 are involved in hematopoietic cell differentiation and gene expression; and GATA-4, -5, and -6 influence endodermally and mesodermally derived tissues, including lung and heart (16Dimaline R.

Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Because all GATA family members share the same highly conserved DNA-binding domain and consensus binding element, WGATAR, the functional specificity of GATA family members is thought to be mediated by collaboration with other transcription factors or co-factors to activate transcription of target genes (22Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 23Holmes M. Turner J. Fox A. Chisholm O. Crossley M. Chong B. J. Biol.

For example, in cardiac tissues, GATA-4 is co-expressed with Nkx2.5 (Tinman) in early cardiac progenitor cells (25Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that only GATA-4, but not GATA-6 or GATA-1, directly interacts and synergizes Nkx2.5 activity. In previous studies (27Shaw-White J.R. Bruno M.D. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2658-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), GATA-6 was found to bind to elements in the 5′-flanking region of the ttf-1 gene, enhancingttf-1 gene transcription. The temporal-spatial expression patterns of GATA-6 and TTF-1 overlap in the developing lung and coincide with the sites of expression of surfactant protein, including SP-C (28Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Recent studies (29Glasser S.W. Burhans M.S. Korfhagen T.R. Na C.L. Sly P.D. Ross G.F. Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6366-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) demonstrated the critical role of surfactant protein-C in surfactant function and pathogenesis of hereditary interstitial lung disease. Likewise, GATA-6 activatedsp-A gene transcription in vitro (5Bruno M.D. Korfhagen T.R. Liu C. Morrisey E.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1043-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The present study was therefore undertaken to test whether GATA-6 influences the activity of the surfactant protein-C promoter and whether GATA-6 and TTF-1 might directly interact via protein-protein interactions. The present study demonstrates physical interactions between GATA-6 and TTF-1 and their synergistic effects on the transcription of the mousesp-C promoter. DISCUSSIONGATA-6 and TTF-1 synergistically stimulated the activity of the surfactant protein C promoter. Direct interaction of the two transcription factors was observed by co-precipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assays. The binding interaction was dependent upon the homeodomain region of TTF-1 and the amino-terminal and zinc finger domains of GATA-6. Whereas the zinc finger domains of GATA-4 and GATA-6 were highly conserved, the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain of GATA-6 conferred more active synergistic activation of thesp-C promoter in the presence of TTF-1. Direct interactions between TTF-1 and GATA-6, and their co-expression during morphogenesis of the lung, support the concept that protein-protein interactions between these members of the distinct transcription proteins may play a role in the expression of target genes in the respiratory epithelium.Whereas neither GATA-6 nor TTF-1 expression is confined to the lung during development, these transcription factors are co-expressed only in peripheral respiratory epithelial cells of the developing lung, where they cooperatively activated the expression of thesp-C promoter. The sites of co-expression are also consistent with the cell-selective expression of pro-SP-C and other surfactant proteins, including surfactant proteins A and B. TTF-1 is expressed in the forebrain and thyroid and does not overlap with the expression pattern of GATA-6 in these non-respiratory tissues (32Bingle C.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1471-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). TTF-1 and GATA-6 were also co-expressed in MLE-15 cells, consistent with previous findings demonstrating the requirement of TTF-1 for the expression of surfactant proteins in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to TTF-1, GATA-6 was not sufficient for activation of sp-C gene expression in HeLa cells; however, the two proteins synergistically activated the sp-Cpromoter, demonstrating distinct roles of the GATA-6 and TTF-1 elements within the mouse sp-C promoter. Consensus elements for the binding sites for GATA-6 (−152 to −148 and −42 to −39) and TTF-1 (−197 to −158) are present on the mouse sp-C promoter, consistent with the ability of each protein to bind directly at their cis-active elements (6Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The close apposition of the NKE and GATA elements in the sp-C promoter also supports possible direct and indirect interactions between these two factors within thesp-C promoter.Studies in the cardiac specific gene expression and the expression of atrial natriuretic factor have provided precedents for the interaction between GATA and Nkx family members (22Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 (tinman) synergistically activated cardiac α-actin gene expression in vitro, and direct interactions between the two proteins were observed in in vitro co-precipitation assays (25Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The interactions between Nkx2.5 and GATA-4 were also dependent upon the zinc finger domain in GATA-4 and the homeodomain of the Nkx2.5, findings similar to those presently observed between TTF-1 and GATA-6. These data and others studies (23Holmes M. Turner J. Fox A. Chisholm O. Crossley M. Chong B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23491-23498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Huggins G.S. Bacani C.J. Boltax J. Aikawa R. Leiden J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20762-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) support the role of zinc finger domain as a protein-protein interaction domain.Because the zinc finger of GATA-6 mediated both DNA binding and interaction with TTF-1, the nature of these interactions was assessed by substitution mutations, exchanging the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger of GATA-4 for that of GATA-6 by insertion of G646. Whereas this GATA-6 mutant maintained DNA binding activity to the consensus GATA site, its ability to activate the sp-C promoter in a synergistic manner was decreased. The loss of synergy of the GATA-6 (G646) mutant with TTF-1 is likely mediated by impaired interactions between TTF-1 and the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain of GATA-6 rather than by changes in DNA binding, because the DNA binding domain is intact. However, both pVPGATA-4 and pVPG646 interacted with TTF-1 in the two-hybrid assay. Thus, the activity of GATA-6 to bind to TTF-1 was not directly correlated with the ability to stimulate synergistically thesp-C promoter, suggesting multiple mechanisms by which GATA-6 may influence its activity.Because TTF-1 is known to interact with a number of other transcription factors with binding sites located in close proximity to the NKEs, TTF-1 and GATA-6 are likely to interact in complex ways at both cis-acting elements with each other and with other protein partners within complexes in the promoters of the target gene.

Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The close apposition of the NKE and GATA elements in the sp-C promoter also supports possible direct and indirect interactions between these two factors within thesp-C promoter. Studies in the cardiac specific gene expression and the expression of atrial natriuretic factor have provided precedents for the interaction between GATA and Nkx family members (22Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 (tinman) synergistically activated cardiac α-actin gene expression in vitro, and direct interactions between the two proteins were observed in in vitro co-precipitation assays (25Sepulveda J.L. Belaguli N. Nigam V. Chen C.Y. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The interactions between Nkx2.5 and GATA-4 were also dependent upon the zinc finger domain in GATA-4 and the homeodomain of the Nkx2.5, findings similar to those presently observed between TTF-1 and GATA-6. These data and others studies (23Holmes M. Turner J. Fox A. Chisholm O. Crossley M. Chong B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23491-23498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Huggins G.S. Bacani C.J. Boltax J. Aikawa R. Leiden J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20762-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) support the role of zinc finger domain as a protein-protein interaction domain. Because the zinc finger of GATA-6 mediated both DNA binding and interaction with TTF-1, the nature of these interactions was assessed by substitution mutations, exchanging the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger of GATA-4 for that of GATA-6 by insertion of G646. Whereas this GATA-6 mutant maintained DNA binding activity to the consensus GATA site, its ability to activate the sp-C promoter in a synergistic manner was decreased. The loss of synergy of the GATA-6 (G646) mutant with TTF-1 is likely mediated by impaired interactions between TTF-1 and the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain of GATA-6 rather than by changes in DNA binding, because the DNA binding domain is intact. However, both pVPGATA-4 and pVPG646 interacted with TTF-1 in the two-hybrid assay. Thus, the activity of GATA-6 to bind to TTF-1 was not directly correlated with the ability to stimulate synergistically thesp-C promoter, suggesting multiple mechanisms by which GATA-6 may influence its activity. Because TTF-1 is known to interact with a number of other transcription factors with binding sites located in close proximity to the NKEs, TTF-1 and GATA-6 are likely to interact in complex ways at both cis-acting elements with each other and with other protein partners within complexes in the promoters of the target gene. TTF-1 binds and interacts with BR22, RARs, and CBP/P300 in complexes involved in the activation of the sp-B gene promoter (15Yang Y.S. Yang M.C. Wang B. Weissler J.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, TTF-1 binds and synergistically activates the sp-C promoter with nuclear factor-1, binding at sites located −307 to −91, in close proximity to both GATA-6 and TTF-1-binding sites.2 Because GATA-6, TTF-1, NF1, RARs, and other co-factors change developmentally, and may also influence histone acetylation, distinct transcriptional complex may serve to regulate target gene expression during lung development. Furthermore, cis-active elements binding AP-1, NF1, and CREB overlap with the NKE sites in various surfactant protein promoter elements. Interestingly, although GATA-4 interacts with TTF-1, it does not synergistically activate the mouse sp-C promoter in HeLa cells as well as GATA-6, suggesting that the binding is not sufficient for synergy between GATA and Nkx family members. Activation by GATA-6 or GATA-4 may be mediated by various mechanisms, including direct binding to GATA elements or by the formation of transcription complexes mediated by direct or indirect interactions between TTF-1 and GATA-6 or among TTF-1, GATA-6, and other transcription factors. Both GATA-6 and TTF-1 play important but distinct roles in lung morphogenesis and gene expression. TTF-1 is required for the formation of the lung periphery during lung morphogenesis.ttf-1(−/−) mice have severely hypoplastic lung rudiments, lacking peripheral lung parenchyma at birth (10Minoo P. Su G. Drum H. Bringas P. Kimura S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TTF-1 is required for expression of surfactant proteins A–C and CCSP in the respiratory epithelium in vitro and in vivo (6Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar,8Zhang L. Whitsett J.A. Stripp B.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17327-17332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). GATA-6 regulates ttf-1 gene transcription itself, binding and activating the ttf-1 gene promoter (27Shaw-White J.R. Bruno M.D. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2658-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). GATA-6 is required for endoderm formation per se, and targeted deletion of GATA-6 was lethal early during embryogenesis before lung bud formation (36Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3579-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), although recent studies (37Keijzer R. van Tuyl M. Meijers C. Post M. Tibboel D. Grosveld F. Koutsourakis M. Development. 2001; 128: 503-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that it may function later in lung morphogenesis. Surprisingly, GATA-6 plays distinct roles in the expression of surfactant protein B, inhibiting TTF-1-dependent activation of the sp-B promoter (data not shown), and may therefore play distinct roles in the regulation of various target gene promoters. Whether these distinct effects of GATA-6 on surfactant protein B and C gene transcription contribute to distinct patterns of expression of pro-SP-B and pro-SP-C in the developing lung remain to be discerned. Thus, TTF-1 and GATA-6 interact in complex ways at cis-active elements of target genes. TTF-1 and GATA-6 bind directly to NKE and GATA elements, located in close proximity within the surfactant protein C promoter. GATA-6 and TTF-1 can directly interact through the zinc finger domain of GATA-6 and the homeodomain of TTF-1. Furthermore, TTF-1 forms complexes with other transcription factors, including NF1, RARs, and co-factors, to influence the activity of the surfactant protein C promoter.

A-BaP DE adducts were bypassed by pol V with moderate accuracy and considerably higher efficiency than by pol II or IV. Error-prone pol V copied G-BaP DE-adducted DNA poorly, forming A·G-BaP DE-S and -R mismatches over C·G-BaP DE-S and -R correct matches by factors of ∼350- and 130-fold, respectively, even favoring G·G-BaP DE mismatches over correct matches by factors of 2–4-fold. In contrast, pol IV bypassed G-BaP DE adducts with the highest efficiency and fidelity, making misincorporations with a frequency of 10−2 to 10−4 depending on sequence context. G-BaP DE-S-adducted M13 DNA yielded 4-fold fewer plaques when transfected into SOS-induced ΔdinB (pol IV-deficient) mutant cells compared with the isogenic wild-typeE. coli strain, consistent with the in vitrodata showing that pol IV was most effective by far at copying the G-BaP DE-S adduct.

Cell. 2001; 8: 7-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). This new polymerase family is typified by the UmuC, DinB, Rev1, and Rad30 proteins, which represent distinct phylogenetic branches of the Y-family tree (4McDonald J.P. Rapic-Otrin U. Epstein J.A. Broughton B.C. Wang X. Lehmann A.R. Wolgemuth D.J. Woodgate R. Genomics. 1999; 60: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 5Gerlach V.L. Aravind L. Gotway G. Schultz R. Koonin E.V. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11922-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The Y-family polymerases lack intrinsic exonuclease activity and are distributive in the absence of stimulatory accessory factors (6Goodman M.F. Tippin B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Members of this new polymerase family are best characterized by their lesion-bypassing properties; but it is clear that when they replicate undamaged DNA, they do so with fidelities much lower than those of the A-, B-, and C-family polymerases (6Goodman M.F. Tippin B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Both E. coli Y-family pol IV (DinB) and pol V (UmuD′2C) are expressed at elevated levels as part of the cell's global SOS response to DNA damage (7Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995Google Scholar). It is clear from years of genetic characterization of umuD and umuCmutants that the principal role of pol V is to bypass template bases that effectively block normal pol III-catalyzed DNA replication because deletion of the umu operon or missense mutations in eitherumuD or umuC effectively render E. coli cells non-mutable, despite being exposed to a variety of mutagens (8Kato T. Shinoura Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 156: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 9Steinborn G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 165: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 10Woodgate R. Mutat. Res. 1992; 281: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Translesion DNA synthesis catalyzed by pol V results in mutations targeted directly opposite DNA damage sites. However, in addition to its primary role in replicating across from damaged bases, pol V also causes untargeted base substitution mutations in the absence of DNA damage (11Fijalkowska I.J. Dunn R.L. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7435-7445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).pol IV is responsible for generating frameshift mutations on undamaged DNA, causing adaptive mutations in non-dividing cells (12Foster P.L.

Cell. 2001; 7: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), mutations that are kept in check by the presence of pol II (14Foster P.L. Gudmunson G. Trimarchi J.M. Cai H. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that the primary role of pol IV may be to rescue stalled replication forks, which seem to occur at least once per round of replication (15Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherattt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), possibly by extending slipped mispairs that are refractory to proofreading. Genetic experiments also implicate pol IV in translesion synthesis (TLS) of certain types of lesion such as acetylaminofluorene-modified G residues as well as benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide (BaP DE) G-adducted DNA (16Napolitano R.

Although the main cellular role of pol II is believed to be in “error-free” replication restart (21Rangarajan S. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9224-9229Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), it also can copy specific DNA lesions in vivo (16Napolitano R. Janel-Bintz R. Wagner J. Fuchs R.P.P.

Kennedy M.A. Genetics. 1993; 136: 439-448Crossref Google Scholar).In this study, we have investigated the ability of the five E. coli DNA polymerases to copy bulky adducts derived fromtrans-ring opening of bay region 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide metabolites of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[a]pyrene (BaP DE; see Fig. 1 A). Two 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide diastereomers, each consisting of a pair of enantiomers, are formed metabolically in mammals. These BaP DEs are mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cells (23Wood A.W. Wislocki P.G. Chang R.L. Levin W., Lu, A.Y.H. Yagi H. Hernandez O. Jerina D.M. Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 3358-3366PubMed Google Scholar), and the predominant isomer formed metabolically, the (+)-enantiomer of the diastereomer (shown in Fig. 1 A), whose benzylic hydroxyl group and epoxide oxygen are trans, is highly tumorigenic in mice (24Buening M.K. Wislocki P.G. Levin W. Yagi H. Thakker D.R. Akagi H. Koreeda M. Jerina D.M. Conney A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5358-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). DNA damage by BaP DEs, which target the exocyclic amino groups of purines in DNA (see Fig. 1 A) (25Jerina D.M. Chadha A. Cheh A.M. Schurdak M.E. Wood A.W. Sayer J.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 283: 533-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), is most likely an important initiating event in both mutagenesis and cell transformation. Replicative DNA polymerases are generally blocked by bulky adducts (26Cordiero-Stone M. Zaritskay L.S. Price L.K. Kaufmann W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13945-13954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and human pol α replicates at best very poorly opposite BaP DE adducts (27Hruskewycz A.M. Canella K.A. Peltonen K. Kotrappa L. Dipple A. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 2347-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), as does the non-SOS-induced E. coli polymerase I Klenow fragment (28Shibutani S. Margulis L.A. Geacintov N.E.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14297-14305Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, it is attractive to speculate that error-prone TLS by bypass polymerases may be highly significant in the observed induction of mutations by these adducts, especially in SOS-induced cells (30Page J.E.

Dipple A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two central issues are addressed in this study. First, we compare the efficiency and accuracy of TLS by the SOS-induced DNA polymerases when copying the G- and A-BaP DE adducts. Second, data on the efficiency and accuracy of BaP DE adduct bypass by the SOS-induced polymerases in vitro are then compared with in vivo data in ΔpolB (pol II), ΔdinB (pol IV), and ΔumuDC (pol V) mutant backgrounds to address the extent to which the model in vitro measurements correlate with in vivo results.DISCUSSIONThe related UmuC/DinB/Rev1/Rad30 polymerases, recently renamed the Y-family of DNA polymerases (3Ohmori H.

Thus, pol IV and II are believed to carry out specialized reactions principally involving undamaged DNA, whereas the role of pol V seems restricted to copying damaged DNA.It is crucial, however, to avoid “pigeonholing” the SOS polymerases into categories of those that copy either damaged or undamaged DNA, especially because so little is known concerning their actual cellular occupations. Although the genetic (55Frank E.G. Ennis D.G. Gonzales M. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10291-10296Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 56Woodgate R.

Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) data support a primary, perhaps exclusive role for pol V in copying UV-damaged DNA and abasic lesions, different polymerases might well be used to copy other types of damaged or modified template bases. Previous examples that support this point in E. coli include the use of pol II to copy abasic sites in the absence of heat shock proteins (22Tessman I. Kennedy M.A. Genetics. 1993; 136: 439-448Crossref Google Scholar) and the involvement of both pol II and V (but not pol IV) in copying an N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene G adduct (16Napolitano R. Janel-Bintz R. Wagner J. Fuchs R.P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6259-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In a reversal of logic, it turns out that the high fidelity pol II generates −2 frameshifts during TLS of acetylaminofluorene G, whereas the low fidelity pol V is responsible for error-free lesion bypass (16Napolitano R. Janel-Bintz R. Wagner J. Fuchs R.P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6259-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Most closely related to our experiments are data showing that pol IV and V carry out error-free and −1 frameshift TLS, respectively, when copying a G-BaP DE-adducted template in vivo (16Napolitano R. Janel-Bintz R. Wagner J. Fuchs R.P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6259-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).SOS Polymerase-catalyzed BaP DE Adduct Bypass EfficienciesG-BaP DE adducts were bypassed most efficiently by pol IV in vitro, irrespective of isomer and sequence context, with TLS efficiencies ∼3–10-fold higher than those for pol V (Fig. 3 A and Table I). pol II was able to bypass G-BaP DE, albeit with poor efficiency, in just one of the two sequence contexts (context IV) (Fig. 3 A and Table I). The TLS efficiency reflects the fraction of primer molecules that are extended beyond the lesion. The biological relevance of these in vitroobservations is supported by the observation that when transfected into pol IV (ΔdinB)-null mutant cells induced for SOS, G-BaP DE-S-adducted M13 DNA gave rise to 4-fold fewer plaques relative to wild-type cells or compared with null mutants in either pol II (ΔpolB) or pol V (ΔumuDC) (Fig.3 B and Table IV).pol IV, which bypassed G-BaP DE adducts with efficiencies between 36 and 71%, did not significantly bypass A-BaP DE adducts, nor did pol II (Fig. 3 A and Table I). pol V, however, bypassed both A- and G-BaP DE adducts with roughly similar efficiencies, which were lower than that of pol IV for the G adducts (Fig. 3 A and Table I). The A-BaP DE-S adduct was bypassed ∼3-fold less efficiently than G-BaP DE-S in SOS-induced cells in vivo (Fig. 3 B and Table IV). However, no difference was observed in the “survival” of A-BaP DE-adducted M13 DNA in any of the wild-type or polymerase-deficient mutant backgrounds (Fig.3 B and Table IV). Consequently, no clear conclusion can be drawn concerning which polymerase or polymerases might be involved in replicating past A-BaP DE-S. pol I showed a weak ability to bypass the A-BaP DE-S adduct, so perhaps it might play a role in vivo, even though it was not as active in bypassing this lesion compared with pol V in vitro (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 6). It has previously been shown that proofreading-proficient and -deficient forms of pol I KF exhibit different patterns of TLS and misincorporations when copying A-BaP DE adducts depending on the stereochemistry at C-10 (58Chary P. Lloyd R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). pol III holoenzyme was essentially unable to bypass any of the BaP DE adducts (Fig. 2, lane 3).SOS Polymerase Misincorporation and Extension Fidelity at BaP DE AdductsNot only did pol IV copy G-BaP DE adducts more efficiently compared with pol V, but it did so much more accurately. Thus, pol IV favors incorporation of C opposite R andS isomers of BaP DE by between 2 and 4 orders of magnitude, whereas pol V favors formation of A·G-BaP DE mispairs by factors of 130–350 (Table II). The extension efficiencies for the two enzymes mirror the incorporation efficiencies. pol IV favored extension of C·G-BaP DE correct base pairs by 1000–10,000-fold over any of the mispairs (Table III). True to form, pol V favored extension of the favored A·G-BaP DE mispairs over the C·G-BaP DE correct pairs (Table III).The bottom line is that the action of pol V on G-BaP DE adducts would be expected to generate G·C to T·A transversions, whereas few base substitution mutations would be expected to occur when G-BaP DE adducts are copied by pol IV. We made a preliminary estimate of the types and frequency of mutations by sequencing a subset of M13 progeny containing G-BaP DE-S adducts in context IV (Fig. 1) in the different polymerase-null mutant backgrounds that were SOS-induced. The in vitro kinetic data and in vivo mutational data agree with respect to the “strongest” prediction: the frequency of G·C to T·A mutations increases by ∼7-fold in a pol IV-null mutant background. With the G-BaP DE-S adducts, G·C to T·A mutations occur with a frequency of ∼1% in the SOS-induced wild-type strain (two mutants/176 DNA molecules sequenced) compared with 6.8% in the absence of pol IV (three mutants/44 DNA molecules sequenced).Although these numbers are admittedly small, the conclusions are supported by data in the pol II-null background, where the G to T transversion frequency is again 1% (one mutant/104 DNA molecules sequenced). G to T error frequencies have an intermediate value of ∼3.1% in the pol V-null background (3/98). These errors are perhaps made by pol II, which forms A·G-BaP DE-S mispaired intermediates at an elevated frequency of ∼7% in context IV (although the favored pol II mispair is with T at a frequency of ∼14%) (Table II).Because of the small numbers and the obvious complexities of attempting to make a direct comparison of the in vitro and in vivo data, e.g. the inability to take into account the effects of proofreading and post-replication mismatch repair (acting on double-stranded M13 replication intermediates), no strong conclusions can be drawn concerning which of the polymerases is responsible for causing specific types of mutations in vivo. Despite this caveat, however, several conclusions can be drawn from the data. The most important conclusion, from a biological perspective, is that the three SOS polymerases (pol II, IV, and V) are each likely to play some role in bypassing BaP DE adducts. Based on both the in vivoand in vitro kinetic data, pol IV copies and bypasses G-BaP DE adducts with highest efficiency and accuracy. In contrast, the errant pol V copies G-BaP DE adducts with remarkable inaccuracy and furthermore favors extension of the resultant mispairs over correct pairs. The most exceptional errors are an A·G-BaP DE-Smispair, favored by 350-fold over a C·G-BaP DE-S correct pair, and an A·G-BaP DE-R mispair, favored by 132-fold over its correctly paired counterpart. Both of these mispairs are selectively extended by pol V with efficiencies of 23- and 3.9-fold over the corresponding correct pairs. In contrast to its ability to catalyze G-BaP DE TLS efficiently, pol IV is essentially unable to bypass R and S isomers of A-BaP DE. On the other hand, pol V copies A-BaP DE adducts efficiently and relatively “accurately,” making A·A-BaP DE-R mispairs with a frequency of only 23% and A·A-BaP DE-S mispairs with a frequency of 8.4%. Extension of both of these mispairs by pol V occurs with efficiencies similar to those of extension of T·A-BaP DE correct pairs. Thus, the kinetic data support a growing body of evidence that although each of the SOS polymerases appears to have a primary role to play in the cell (pol V for error-prone TLS on heavily damaged DNA, pol IV for relieving blocked replication forks on undamaged DNA, and pol II for catalyzing error-free replication restart), each enzyme can also play a role in copying various types of DNA template damage.

It is clear from years of genetic characterization of umuD and umuCmutants that the principal role of pol V is to bypass template bases that effectively block normal pol III-catalyzed DNA replication because deletion of the umu operon or missense mutations in eitherumuD or umuC effectively render E. coli cells non-mutable, despite being exposed to a variety of mutagens (8Kato T.

We show here that SYT, a partner protein generating the synovial sarcoma fusion protein SYT-SSX, associates with native human SNF/SWI complexes.

The C-terminal region (amino acids 310–387) of SSX1, comprising the SSX1 portion of the SYT-SSX1 fusion protein, binds strongly to core histones and oligonucleosomes in vitro and directs nuclear localization of a green fluorescence protein fusion protein. Experiments with serial C-terminal deletion mutants of SSX1 indicate that these properties map to a common region and also correlate with the previously demonstrated anchorage-independent colony formation activity of SYT-SSX in Rat 3Y1 cells. These data suggest that SYT-SSX interferes with the function of either the SNF/SWI complexes or another SYT-interacting co-activator, p300, by changing their targeted localization or by directly inhibiting their chromatin remodeling activities.

A recent study suggested that the Rb-SNF/SWI complex differentially regulates expression of cyclin E and cyclin A, depending on the association with a histone deacetylase (HDAC1), and thereby controls progression from G1 into S phase or exit from S phase (42Zhang H.

Activities of the SNF/SWI complexes themselves are also regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, because both hbrm and BRG-1 are inactivated by phosphorylation at the G2/M transition (43Muchardt C.

Reyes J.-C. Yaniv Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that some SNF/SWI components physically interact with other cell cycle regulators (46Cheng S.W. Davies K.P. Yung E. Beltran R.J., Yu, J. Kalpana G.V. Nat.

Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, a major signal mediator in lymphocytes, induces translocation of SNF/SWI complexes to chromatin (49Zhao K. Wang W. Rando O.J. Xue Y. Swiderek K. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Finally, involvement of the SWI/SNF proteins in malignant transformation has been highlighted by the discovery that theINI1/hSNF5 gene is frequently mutated in rhabdoid tumors (50Versteege I.

A number of studies have reported alterations of the genes encoding SNF/SWI subunits in various human cancers (51Wong A.K. Shanahan F. Chen Y. Lian L., Ha, P. Hendricks K. Ghaffari S. Iliev D.

SYT is a ubiquitously expressed protein with a QPGY domain, whereas the SSX proteins carry KRAB-like domains and are expressed almost exclusively in the testis (54Crew A.J. Clark J. Fisher C. Gill S. Grimer R. Chand A. Shipley J. Gusterson B.A. Cooper C.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The SYT and SSX proteins localize in distinct nuclear domains. Localization of the SYT-SSX fusion proteins does not appear to be completely identical to that of either SYT or SSX, although variability has been reported (55Brett D. Whitehouse S. Antonson P.

Interestingly, the SYT-SSX and SYT proteins appear to localize in particular nuclear speckles where hbrm protein is present (59Thaete C. Brett D. Monaghan P. Whitehouse S. Rennie G. Rayner E. Cooper C.S. Goodwin G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, altered localization of the SYT-SSX proteins and their associated proteins may account for the underlying mechanisms of synovial sarcoma formation. Here we report that the SYT protein in fact is present in native human SNF/SWI complexes and shares the QPGY domain with the largest subunits of these complexes. Interestingly, the C-terminal 78-amino acid region of SSX1 binds strongly to core histones and oligonucleosomes. Deletion analysis reveals that this activity correlates both with the nuclear localization of the SSX1 C-terminal domain and with the transforming activity of SYT-SSX in rat 3Y1 cells (60Nagai M. Tanaka S. Tsuda M. Endo S. Kato H. Sonobe H. Minami A. Hiraga H. Yamawaki S. Nishihara H. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3843-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the forced mislocalization or dysfunction of the SYT-associated chromatin remodeling factors, such as the SNF/SWI complexes or the SYT-interacting co-activator p300, by SYT-SSX is the cause of the malignant transformation. Human SNF/SWI complexes were affinity-purified on anti-FLAG antibody (M2)-conjugated agarose (Kodak/IBI) from nuclear extracts prepared from FLAG-tagged INI1-expressing HeLa (F-Ini1-HeLa) cells essentially as described by Sif et al. (44Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Complexes were washed extensively (five times) with buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 500 mm KCl (300 mm in some preparations) prior to elution with FLAG peptide. For mass spectrometric protein identification, the complexes were further purified and concentrated by batch-adsorption onto SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and elution with buffer D, 300 mm KCl. The eluate was directly applied onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Novex/Invitrogen). The SNF/SWI complexes were separated by 4 to 20% gradient SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) R-250 or by negative staining with zinc sulfate and imidazole (Bio-Rad). The excised bands were destained and processed by in-gel digestion with trypsin (61Krutchinsky A.N. Zhang W. Chait B.T. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Molecular masses of the peptides were determined by MS analysis with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (61Krutchinsky A.N. Zhang W. Chait B.T. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and the assignment was confirmed by the subsequent MS/MS analysis of selected ion species. Proteins were identified by using the search engines ProFound (62Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) and PepFrag (63Fenyo D. Qin J. Chait B.T. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 998-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). C-terminal and N-terminal B120 fragments (64Takeuchi T. Chen B.K. Qui Y. Sonobe H. Ohtsuki Y. Gene. 1997; 204: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were used to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library in λZAPII (Stratagene) for p250 cDNAs. The most abundant spliced variant in the 5′-end sequence was selected from among cDNAs isolated by screening as well as from the NCBI data base. The resulting p250 cDNA is a composite of human fetal brain cDNAs (nucleotides (nt) 1–430 and 2571–6042) and B120 cDNA (nt 431–2570). The p250R cDNA was isolated by screening the human fetal brain phage library with a probe from GenBankTM cDNA (AA191300). The 5′-terminal sequence was obtained from HeLa cDNA by using the oligo-capping cloning method as described previously (65Maruyama K. Sugano S. Gene. 1994; 138: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Briefly, the PCR template was synthesized with reverse transcriptase and an oligo-dT primer from HeLa cell mRNA 5′-capped with an oligo RNA (5′-AGCAUCGAGUCGGCCUUGUUGGCCUACUCC-3′). A nested PCR reaction was performed with cap primers (5′-AGCATCGAGTCGGCCTTGTTGGC-3′ and 5′-GAGTCGGCCTTGTTGGCCTACTC-3′) and p250R internal primers corresponding to nt 2024–2001 and 1925–1902. The p250R cDNA is a composite of HeLa (nt 1–2590) and the fetal brain (nt 2591–5123) cDNAs. Rabbit antisera (Covance, Denver, PA) to p250 and p250R were raised against a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p250 (amino acids 640–806) fusion protein containing the ARID domain and a GST-p250R (amino acids 21–274) fusion protein, respectively. Antibodies were affinity-purified on corresponding GST fusion proteins coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Purified antibodies were cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and used for purification of the SNF/SWI complexes from HeLa nuclear extract. Antibody coupling and subsequent washing of the cross-linked matrix were performed under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Immune complexes were washed extensively (four to five times) with buffer D containing 500 mm KCl and eluted with an acidic solution. Antisera to SYT (C44) and SSX2 (B39), generously provided by D. de Bruijn, were used for coupling on Protein G-Sepharose 4FF (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) with dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride (Sigma Chemical Co.) at a final concentration of 60 mm for 30 min at room temperature. Monoclonal antibody to FLAG epitope (M2) and M2 conjugated to Sepharose were purchased from Sigma. Affinity-purified proteins or extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), incubated first with an antiserum or a purified antibody and then with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit for all polyclonal antibodies or anti-mouse for anti-FLAG antibody), and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL detection reagents, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Antisera and the M2 antibody were used in 1000-fold dilution and at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml, respectively. All of the GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen), and extracts were prepared by sonication in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Native core histones and oligonucleosomes were purified from HeLa cells as described (66Cote J. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods Mol. Genet. 1995; 6: 108-152Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recombinant full-length and tailless histones were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified. 2W. An and R. G. Roeder, unpublished data. GST proteins (∼3–6 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with HeLa nuclear extract (5 mg) or recombinant H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones (∼0.5 μg each) and washed four times with buffer D containing 300 mm KCl. Bound proteins were either eluted with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate or directly suspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by 4 to 20% gradient SDS-PAGE. Enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fusion proteins with the SSX1 C-terminal regions were constructed with pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH) and transfected into Vero cells by using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, fluorescence was directly detected by a high-performance digital cooled charge-coupled device camera (AxioCam, Carl Zeiss) interfaced with a computer (OptiPlex, Dell) and processed by an analysis system (AxioVision, Carl Zeiss). The obtained images were edited by using software (Photoshop 5.0, Adobe). Thaete et al. (59Thaete C. Brett D. Monaghan P. Whitehouse S. Rennie G. Rayner E. Cooper C.S. Goodwin G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) reported co-localization of SYT with hbrm in characteristic nuclear speckles. However, the presence of endogenous SYT protein in native SNF/SWI complexes has not been demonstrated. To investigate this possibility, the SNF/SWI complexes (Fig. 1) purified from FLAG-tagged Ini1-expressing HeLa cell nuclear extract (44Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) by an immunoaffinity precipitation method using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2)-conjugated agarose beads were analyzed by Western blotting. An anti-SYT serum (C44) detected two strong bands of 53 and 65 kDa in F-Ini1-HeLa nuclear extract and in all three preparations of the purified SNF/SWI complexes but not in the control SPT5 complex isolated from a FLAG-tagged SPT5-expressing cell line (Fig.2 A, upper panel). M2 monoclonal antibody detected a band of ∼160 kDa and degradation products in the SPT5 complex 3M. Estable and R. G. Roeder, unpublished data. (middle panel), as well as an F-Ini1 protein of 49 kDa both in the SNF/SWI complexes and in F-Ini1-HeLa nuclear extract (lower panel). Because the in vitro translated SYT protein has been detected as a 53-kDa band, the 65-kDa band may represent either a modified or an alternatively spliced or translated product (56dos Santos N.R. de Bruijn D.R.H. Balemans M. Janssen B. Gartner F. Lopes J.M. de Leeuw B. van Kessel A.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It appears that most (more than 50%) of the SYT protein associates with the SNF/SWI complexes, because signal ratios of SYT to F-Ini1 between the purified SNF/SWI complexes and the F-Ini1-HeLa nuclear extract are equivalent (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Detection of SYT protein in SNF/SWI complexes. A, immunoblotting with α-SYT antiserum. Three different preparations of the purified SNF/SWI complexes (left and right, washed with 0.3 mKCl; middle, washed with 0.5 m KCl) in combination with a purified SPT5 complex and F-Ini1-HeLa nuclear extract were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (upper and lower panels, 10%; middle panel, 5%) and analyzed by immunoblotting with α-SYT or α-FLAG as the first antibody. Anti-rabbit (for anti-SYT antibody) and anti-mouse (for anti-FLAG antibody) secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used. Arrows indicate two specific α-SYT-reactive bands of 53 and 65 kDa. The small and large arrowheads indicate the 160-kDa SPT5 protein and the 49-kDa FLAG-tagged Ini1 protein, respectively. B, immunoprecipitation of Ini1 protein. The association between Ini1 and SYT was tested by immunoprecipitation with α-SYT and control antisera. Antisera cross-linked on Sepharose beads were incubated with F-Ini1-HeLa nuclear extract and analyzed by immunoblotting with α-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2). F-Ini1 (49 kDa) is indicated by thearrow. C, analysis by MS/MS. Gel slices obtained from the 53- to 55-kDa region in Fig. 1 were analyzed by MS and MS/MS spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Trypsin-digested protein samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry. A candidate peptide from the 53- to 55-kDa sample matching the C-terminal peptide of the SYT protein was further analyzed by the MS/MS (61Krutchinsky A.N. Zhang W. Chait B.T. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The observed and calculated m/z values of the fragment ions from the candidate peptide are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further demonstrate an association between SYT and SNF/SWI complexes, we tested whether the anti-SYT serum immunoprecipitates F-Ini1 protein in the extract. An anti-SYT antibody covalently cross-linked to protein G-Sepharose was incubated with F-Ini1-HeLa nuclear extract, and the resulting pull-down protein was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. The anti-SYT serum clearly (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) was at least as efficient as the anti-Ini1 serum (lane 4) in immunoprecipitating F-Ini1; however, two other control antisera (anti-SSX2 and anti-p73L) were not able to significantly precipitate FLAG-Ini1 protein (lanes 2 and 3). To investigate the abundance of the SYT-containing SNF/SWI complexes in the F-Ini1-containing SNF/SWI complexes, anti-SYT and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot for relative amounts of SYT and F-Ini-1. The percentage of SYT-containing SNF/SWI complexes was estimated as at least 3.4% of the total F-Ini1-containing SNF/SWI complexes (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the signals were due to cross-reaction of the anti-SYT serum with some of the enriched SNF/SWI components, we performed a mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides obtained from several SDS-polyacrylamide gel slices in the 53–55 kDa range (Fig. 1). In one of these slices, we detected a peak atm/z 1680.68 that exactly matches the calculatedm/z value for the SYT peptide PYGYDQGQYGNYQQ. Subsequent MS/MS spectrometric analysis of them/z 1680.68 peptide confirmed this identification (Fig. 2 C). From the relatively low observed signal intensities, we suspect that SYT is a sub-stoichiometric component of the complex. This is the first demonstration of SYT association with native SNF/SWI complexes. In a separate experiment, we analyzed the approximate 50-kDa bands in the SNF/SWI complexes and noticed that a short amino acid motif is commonly present in both SYT and 250-kDa proteins. We therefore became interested in the relationships between these proteins with respect to structure and complex formation.

Depending on the cell type, active caspase-8 either directly activates caspase-3 (type I cells) or relies on mitochondrial signal amplification (type II cells). In MCF7-Fas cells that are deficient for pro-caspase-3, even high amounts of caspase-8 produced at the DISC cannot directly activate downstream effector caspases without mitochondrial help. Overexpression of Bcl-xL in these cells renders them resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis. However, activation of caspase-8 in control (vector) and Bcl-xL transfectants of MCF7-Fas cells proceeds with similar kinetics, resulting in a complete processing of cellular caspase-8. Most of the cytosolic caspase-8 substrates are not cleaved in the Bcl-xL protected cells, raising the question of how Bcl-xL-expressing MCF7-Fas cells survive large amounts of potentially cytotoxic caspase-8. We now demonstrate that active caspase-8 is initially generated at the DISC of both MCF7-Fas-Vec and MCF7-Fas-Bcl-xL cells and that the early steps of CD95 signaling such as caspase-8-dependent cleavage of DISC bound c-FLIPL, caspase-8-dependent clustering, and internalization of CD95, as well as processing of pro-caspase-8 bound to mitochondria are very similar in both transfectants. However, events downstream of mitochondria, such as release of cytochrome c, only occur in the vector-transfected MCF7-Fas cells, and no in vivocaspase-8 activity can be detected in the Bcl-xL-expressing cells. Our data suggest that, in Bcl-xL-expressing MCF7-Fas cells, active caspase-8 is sequestered on the outer mitochondrial surface presumably by association with the protein “bifunctional apoptosis regulator” in a way that does not allow substrates to be cleaved, identifying a novel mechanism of regulation of apoptosis sensitivity by mitochondrial Bcl-xL.

Induction of apoptosis through CD95 involves activation of caspase-8 at the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC).1 The DISC comprises oligomerized CD95, the adapter FADD/Mort1, and the cysteine protease caspase-8, activation of which initiates the caspase cascade for apoptosis (2Muzio M.

Type II cells therefore must have the ability to survive the active caspase-8 that is generated upon binding of death ligands to their receptors. MCF7-Fas cells were chosen to investigate how type II cells survive, because these particular cells are devoid of caspase-3 and therefore cannot respond like type I cells (9Scaffidi C. Fulda S.

We have previously shown that transient expression of pro-caspase-3 in MCF7-Fas cells converted them from type II to type I cells, in which Bcl-xL could not protect them from CD95-mediated apoptosis (9Scaffidi C.

We now show that all of the initial CD95 signaling events such as cleavage of DISC-bound c-FLIPL and pro-caspase-8 and clustering and internalization of CD95 are found in both vector-transfected and Bcl-xL-expressing MCF7-Fas cells. However, shortly after generation at the DISC, active caspase-8 subunits become inactivated in the Bcl-xL-expressing cells, at a time when this protease can be detected on mitochondria. We also demonstrate that the mitochondrial protein BAR, which has been shown to simultaneously bind caspase-8 and Bcl-2 (11Zhang H. Xu Q. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Xie Z. Fuess S. Kitada S. Godzik A. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The data point to a model in which Bcl-xL gives mitochondria of MCF7 cells the ability to sequester and neutralize active caspase-8 through binding to BAR.

For immunoblot detection of proteins, cellular lysates equivalent to 0.4–1 × 106 cells were prepared using a Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, peptide inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1% Triton X-100 (Serva), and 10% glycerol; Ref. 9Scaffidi C.

After electrophoresis proteins were transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS/Tween (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma)) for 1 h, washed with PBS/Tween, and incubated with one of the following antibodies: anti-caspase-8 antibodies C15 or N2 (15Scaffidi C.

The blots were washed with PBS/Tween and developed with horse radish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2b, IgG2a, IgG1 (1:10,000–30,000 in 5% milk PBS/Tween), or rabbit-anti-goat IgG (1:5000 in 5% milk Tween/PBS). After washing with PBS/Tween, blots were developed using an enhanced chemoluminescence method following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Plectin preparation and immunoblots were performed as described previously (16Stegh A.H. Herrmann H. Lampel S. Weisenberger D. Andra K. Seper M. Wiche G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5665-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To measure ΔΨm, anti-CD95 (2 μg/ml)-treated or -untreated MCF7-Fas-Vec or MCF7-Fas-Bcl-xL cells (5 × 105/ml) were incubated with 5 μg/ml 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1; Molecular Probes). The analysis was performed as described (17Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol.

For antibody labeling 0.5 mg of antibody was dialyzed against borate buffer (0.05m boric acid, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 9.2), and incubated with 50 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) in Me2SO for 2 h at room temperature, followed by extensive dialysis against PBS. FITC conjugation was determined by fluorometry and all antibodies equalized for protein and FITC labeling. Cells were plated on Poly-Prep (Sigma) poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides at a confluence of 50% and were allowed to become adherent overnight. After washing three times with PBS containing 1 mmMgCl2 (PBS/MgCl2), the cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1) at −20 °C for 4 min. The slides were allowed to dry, rehydrated with PBS containing 4% bovine serum albumin, and incubated 1 h in a humidified chamber followed by incubation for 1 h with FITC-labeled monoclonal antibody C5 (IgG2a) in PBS/4% bovine serum albumin (15Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). After washing three times with PBS/MgCl2, slides were rinsed in water and dehydrated in 100% ethanol. After drying, coverslips were mounted on the slides, using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) mounting medium. For costaining the cells were incubated with 20 nm MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 prior to washing and fixation, or stained with anti-Bcl-xL rabbit polyclonal (Transduction Laboratories) for 45 min, washed three times in PBS/MgCl2, and incubated for 45 min with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Photographs for colocalization were obtained using confocal microscopy (LSM 510, Zeiss, Jena). Cells were harvested at different times after anti-CD95 stimulation (1 μg/ml) and 107 lysed in 1 ml of Triton X-100 lysis buffer as above. As a control, anti-CD95 antibody was added to lysates prepared from the unstimulated cells. Lysate protein content was determined by Bradford assay and equalized prior to immunoprecipitation. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were added to the samples and tumbled for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 40-fold excess of lysis buffer and subjected either to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting or to a caspase activity assay as described below. Cells (106) were suspended in 50 μl of 5 μg/ml digitonin, 0.25 m sucrose and mixed for 30 s. Cells were then centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm, and 10 μg of supernatant protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as above. MCF7-Fas cells (5 × 107) were stimulated with anti-CD95 (2 μg/ml) for the indicated times and washed with PBS. The fractionation procedure was performed so that cells were homogenized using a glass Dounce homogenizer until a degree of lysis of 60% was reached. Subcellular fractionation to produce heavy membrane and cytosolic fractions was performed as described elsewhere (18Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). For the determination of caspase activity in cytoplasmic or heavy membrane fractions, MCF7-Fas-Vec or MCF7-Fas-Bcl-xL (107each) were stimulated with anti-CD95 (2 μg/ml) for 3 h. Heavy membrane as well as cytoplasmic fractions were incubated in cleavage buffer with 40 μm amino trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC)-labeled caspase-8-specific peptide zIETD (Bachem) for 1 h at 37 °C. Caspase activities were determined fluorometrically using a fluorescence plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). Values obtained with unstimulated cells were taken as background and subtracted from those obtained with stimulated cells. MCF7 heavy membranes were treated with trypsin in trypsin assay buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 0.25m sucrose) for 20 min at 4 °C. Proteins (10 μg) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected by immunoblotting as described above. To induce processing of mitochondrial pro-caspase-8, MCF7 heavy membranes were isolated as described above and treated from 107 cells with recombinant caspases (active concentration, 20 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C. The membranes were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with the N2 antibody (15Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) recognizing the prodomain of caspase-8. Anin vitro binding assay using in vitrotranscribed/translated proteins was performed as described previously (16Stegh A.H. Herrmann H. Lampel S. Weisenberger D. Andra K. Seper M. Wiche G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5665-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In brief 35S-labeled caspase-8, caspase-3, N-CASP-8 (AA 1–216, containing the prodomain), C-CASP-8 (AA 224–479, containing the catalytic domain), or processed C-CASP-8 was incubated with heavy membranes from MCF7-Fas-Bcl-xL cells for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μm zVAD-fmk. Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Active caspase-8 was generated by incubating C-CASP-8 with recombinant caspase-8 (active concentration, 40 μm) for 16 h at room temperature. This treatment resulted in a complete processing of C-CASP-8 into p10 and p18 subunits. A larger p18 subunit (p18*) was also generated, derived from cleavage of CASP-8*. The identity of the fragments was confirmed by immunoprecipitation using subunit-specific anti-caspase-8 mAbs. 2B. C. Barnhart, and M. E. Peter, unpublished data. To test in vitro binding of caspase-8 isoforms described above to BAR, a GST-BAR-DED-L protein (residues 167–358) described recently (11Zhang H. Xu Q. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Xie Z. Fuess S. Kitada S. Godzik A. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2597-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) was immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 10 μl of the indicated 35S-labeled, in vitro translated (TNT reticulate lysates, Promega) caspase-8 proteins in 100 μl of the following binding buffer: 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 142.2 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mmEGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, supplemented with 12.5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mix (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). After incubation for 16 h at 4 °C, beads were washed three times with binding buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The cell-permeable in vivo caspase inhibitor substrate CaspaTag 8 (carboxyfluorescein-LETD-fluoromethyl ketone; Intergen Co., Purchase, NY), was used according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MCF7-Fas-Vec or Bcl-xL cells were plated and allowed to become adherent overnight. The cells were then stimulated with 1 μg/ml anti-CD95 for the indicated times. CaspaTag 8 (1× working dilution) was added to the samples 1 h before harvest. The cells were washed twice and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were detached from flasks by trypsinization and resuspended at 106/ml. For pretreatment with zIETD-fmk (Bachem), cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with 50 μm zIETD-fmk. Cells were then stained at 4 °C with anti-CD95 antibodies for 45 min, washed, and stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. After washing cells were resuspended in media and warmed to 37 °C for 2 h or kept on ice (zero time). Cells were plated for 5 min at 37 °C on plates coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1). Slides were washed, rinsed with water, and coverslips mounted with Vectashield mounting media. Quantification of receptor internalization was done as described previously (19Algeciras-Schimnich A. Shen L. Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Cells (8 × 106) were resuspended in PBS and permeabilized with 200–250 μg/ml lysophosphatidylcholine as determined by trypan blue exclusion as described previously (20Peter M.E. She J. Huber L.A. Terhorst C. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The reagent was added until greater than 99% of cells were permeabilized. Cell pellets and supernatant were then separated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. Protein content was determined and protein amounts equalized. 40 μg (corresponding to ∼10% of the protein fractions) of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting; the remaining fraction was subjected to a caspase-8 activity assay as described above. 293T cells were transfected with different combinations of plasmids encoding the following proteins: wild-type BAR (BARwt) (1 μg of DNA), Bcl-xL (0.2 μg of DNA), and a CD8-caspase-8 fusion protein (0.8 μg of DNA), which produces large amounts of active caspase-8 and induces apoptosis (21Martin D.A. Siegel R.M. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4345-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested and subjected to an apoptosis assay as described previously (9Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar) using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs (BARΔR (Ref. 11Zhang H. Xu Q. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Xie Z. Fuess S. Kitada S. Godzik A. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heavy membranes were isolated and incubated with extracts of CD95-stimulated (3 h) or unstimulated MCF7-Fas-Vec cells, prepared by lysophosphatidylcholine permeabilization for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then removed by centrifugation and the supernatants tested for caspase-8 activity as above using IETD-AFC. Depletion was determined by subtraction from control lysates. Heavy membranes were tested for expression of transfected proteins using immunoblotting. Isolated heavy membranes were treated with 80 μg/ml trypsin in trypsin assay buffer as described above, or with trypsin inactivated with a 2-fold excess (over that required to inhibit this amount of trypsin) of trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Active trypsin was then inhibited with a 2-fold excess of trypsin inhibitor. These membranes were pelleted and resuspended with35S-labeled, in vitro translated caspase-8 and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The membranes were then pelleted, and pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blots of membrane proteins were done to control for trypsin treatment. The breast carcinoma cell line MCF7-Fas behaves as a type II cell in that overexpression of Bcl-xL protects these cells from CD95-induced apoptosis (12Jäättelä M. Benedict M. Tewari M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3388-3393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), decline of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fig.1A). In contrast, processing of caspase-8 was not reduced in the presence of Bcl-xL(Fig. 1B). In fact, after 16 h, most of the cellular pro-caspase-8 had been converted to active caspase-8, with no resulting loss of cell viability. Unexpectedly, however, cleavage of PARP and Bid was inhibited by Bcl-xL (Fig. 1, B andC). Furthermore, degradation of plectin, another directin vivo substrate of caspase-8 (16Stegh A.H. Herrmann H. Lampel S. Weisenberger D. Andra K. Seper M. Wiche G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5665-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), was also inhibited (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate the ability of MCF7-Fas-Bcl-xL cells to tolerate large quantities of active caspase-8. It therefore appears that, in these cells, active caspase-8 subunits are either inactivated and/or prevented from reaching their cytosolic targets. We have recently shown that, in MCF7 cells, pro-caspase-8 is mainly localized on mitochondria (16Stegh A.H. Herrmann H. Lampel S. Weisenberger D. Andra K. Seper M. Wiche G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5665-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In contrast, using confocal microscopy analysis of cells costained for caspase-8 and phosphodiesterase, an enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum, we did not observe a significant localization of caspase-8 to the endoplasmic reticulum2(16Stegh A.H. Herrmann H. Lampel S. Weisenberger D. Andra K. Seper M. Wiche G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5665-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The localization of caspase-8 to mitochondria in these cells is not the result of the absence of caspase-3, because caspase-8 is still localized mainly on mitochondria in MCF7 cells reconstituted with pro-caspase-3 (Fig. 2A). MCF7 cells therefore express caspase-8 at two intracellular locations, in the cytosol and on mitochondria. This raises the question of how mitochondrial pro-caspase-8 is processed. Active caspase-8 may move from the DISC to mitochondria and directly process mitochondrial pro-caspase-8, or mitochondrial pro-caspase-8 may be recruited to the cell surface and become activated at the DISC. Because no significant cleavage of Bid could be detected in the Bcl-xL-expressing MCF7-Fas cells, we tested whether caspase-8 itself might directly process mitochondrial pro-caspase-8. To test this hypothesis we incubated isolated heavy membranes (HM) from MCF7-Fas-Bcl-xL cells with various recombinant caspases and examined which of these proteases are capable of processing HM-associated pro-caspase-8 (Fig. 2B). Among the caspases tested, caspase-8 most efficiently cleaved pro-caspase-8 in this assay. Because all of the pro-caspase-8 in these cells becomes activated after triggering CD95, we postulate that a small quantity of active caspase-8 generated at the DISC might directly activate mitochondrial pro-caspase-8 independently of the apoptogenic activity of mitochondria. Because this activity is blocked by Bcl-xL in vivo (Fig. 1A) but processing of HM-bound pro-caspase-8 occurs, this suggests that caspase-8 is neutralized at the level of mitochondria, assuming that active caspase-8 is generated at the DISC in similar amounts in both transfectants. To directly test this assumption, we immunoprecipitated the DISC and determined its IETD-cleaving activity in a fluorogenic assay (Fig. 2C). Early after receptor triggering, the activity of caspase-8 in the DISC was the same in both transfectants, confirming that the block in the apoptosis pathway in MCF7-Fas-Bcl-xL cells must be located downstream of the DISC. To identify the step in the CD95 pathway where caspase-8 is inactivated in the MCF7-Fas-Bcl-xL cells, we directly compared the time course of processing of pro-caspase-8 at the DISC and on HMs in both vector control and Bcl-xL transfectants (Fig.3A). Stimulation of CD95 in both transfectants resulted in rapid recruitment of caspase-8 and its processing at the DISC (Fig. 3A). The activity of the DISC is reflected by the early appearance of the caspase-8 cleavage intermediates p43/p41. We further found evidence that caspase-8 is initially active when converted at the DISC in both transfectants, as the cleaved p43 form of c-FLIPL is present in the DISC of both vector control and Bcl-xL-expressing cells. Pretreating cells with the caspase-8-selective inhibitor zIETD-fmk inhibited processing of c-FLIPL. Interestingly, most of the cytosolic c-FLIPL was cleaved very early after triggering CD95.2 Thus c-FLIPL and caspase-8 are among the few caspase-8 substrates in MCF7-Fas cells we detected whose cleavage is not blocked by Bcl-xL. The appearance of p43/p41 partially processed pro-caspase-8 on isolated HM fractions seemed to be delayed when compared with its appearance in the DISC, consistent with the initiation of the death signal at the plasma membrane. However, no difference was observed in the rate of loss of full-length pro-caspase-8 in HM fractions when comparing vector and Bcl-xL transfectants, despite the fact that release of cytochrome c from mitochondria could only be detected in the MCF7-Fas-Vec cells (Fig. 3A). The data therefore suggest that the block in the CD95 apoptosis pathway in the Bcl-xL-expressing MCF7-Fas cells resides at a step between proteolytic processing of mitochondria bound pro-caspase-8 and mitochondrial dysfunction (as measured by cytochrome crelease and drop in ΔΨm). Our data suggested that caspase-8 was inhibited in Bcl-xL-expressing cells either by a soluble cytosolic caspase inhibitor or by being bound and sequestered at intracellular membranes. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we permeabilized MCF7-Fas cells using lysophosphatidylcholine, separated supernatant (cytosol) from pellet (membranes), and determined by immunoblot analysis whether active caspase-8 was released or retained in cells (Fig. 3B).

The recently discovered calmodulin-binding protein IQGAP1 binds stoichiometrically to β-catenin and regulates the association of β-catenin with the cell-cell adhesion complex. In the present work, we investigated the role of IQGAP1 on the transcriptional co-activator function of β-catenin, and whether calmodulin modulated the functional interaction between IQGAP1 and β-catenin. In vitro competition assays revealed that both Ca2+/calmodulin and apo-calmodulin, when pre-bound to IQGAP1, prevented binding of β-catenin to IQGAP1, and partially displaced β-catenin pre-bound to IQGAP1 when added subsequently. Conversely, β-catenin partially displaced apo-calmodulin, but not Ca2+/calmodulin, from IQGAP1. Overexpression of IQGAP1 in SW480 colon carcinoma cells enhanced β-catenin-mediated transcriptional co-activation by 1.72-fold, and this stimulation was significantly attenuated upon antagonism of calmodulin using the cell-permeable antagonist CGS9343B. Moreover, an IQGAP1 mutant that does not bind calmodulin was unable to stimulate β-catenin transcriptional function. Results of pulse-chase analyses suggested that IQGAP1 slowed the turnover of soluble, but not total, β-catenin. Immunocytochemistry revealed that IQGAP1 overexpression increased the amount of β-catenin located in the nucleus, whereas incubation of cells with CGS9343B blocked this accumulation. Together, our results imply that IQGAP1 enhances the function of β-catenin in the nucleus and that calmodulin regulates this stimulation. β-Catenin, an oncoprotein integral to cell-cell adhesion and proliferative signaling, is increased in several malignancies.

The primary mediator of Ca2+ signaling in mammalian cells is calmodulin (16Cohen P. Klee C. Calmodulin. Elsevier, New York1988Google Scholar), and IQGAP1 is the major calmodulin-binding protein in Ca2+-free breast epithelial lysates (15Joyal J.L. Annan R.S., Ho, Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J.

Therefore, IQGAP1 may serve as a scaffolding protein, coordinating Ca2+-related signaling with cytoskeletal structure, cell adhesion, and transcriptional activation. In support of this hypothesis, previous analysis documents that IQGAP1 mediates the regulation of Cdc42 (12Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

Overexpression of IQGAP1 attenuates the function of β-catenin in cell-cell adhesion (13Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I.

Moreover, activated Cdc42 and Rac compete with β-catenin for binding to IQGAP1, thereby stabilizing the β-catenin-E-cadherin complex and modifying β-catenin-E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (17Fukata M.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of IQGAP1 on the other characterized function of β-catenin, namely the mediation of transcriptional co-activation, and evaluated the role of calmodulin in this interaction. Analysis by TCF/LEF-responsive luciferase assays revealed that IQGAP1 enhanced the transcriptional co-activator function of β-catenin but only in cells in which β-catenin accumulated to high levels. We observed that calmodulin and β-catenin competed for binding to IQGAP1 in vitro. Moreover, antagonism of calmodulin in intact cells attenuated the IQGAP1-stimulated co-activator function of β-catenin, suggesting that calmodulin modulates the function of β-catenin via IQGAP1. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Biowhittaker. HEK293-H human embryonic kidney cells were obtained from Invitrogen. MCF-7 human breast epithelial carcinoma cells, COS-7 green monkey kidney cells, and SW480 colon epithelial carcinoma cells were from American Type Culture Collection. HEK293 cells stably transfected with pLNCX or the S45Y β-catenin mutant were kind gifts of Drs. Frank McCormick (University of California, San Francisco) and Mien-Chie Hung (University of Texas), respectively. Permanox plastic 8-chamber culture slides were from Fisher. CGS9343B was generously donated by Drs. E. Moret and B. Schmid (Novartis, Switzerland). All other reagents were of standard analytical grade. Anti-myc monoclonal antibodies (9E10.2) were produced by Maine Biotechnology and anti-β-catenin and anti-TCF3/4 monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibodies (18Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal.

Tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, Inc. All cells used in this study were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS in a 37 °C humidified incubator. The medium for HEK293-pLNCX and -S45Y-β-catenin cells included 200 μg/ml G418. myc-tagged wild type human IQGAP1 in pcDNA3 vector was used (9Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P.

The IQGAP1-ΔC mutant encodes an IQGAP1 isoform lacking amino acids 1502–1657, and IQGAP1-ΔIQ lacks amino acids 699–905 (14Li Z. Kim S.H. Higgins J.M. Brenner M.B. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37885-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). All plasmids were purified using DNA purification kits (Qiagen) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. GST fusion proteins were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (12Ho Y.D. Joyal J.L., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Fusion of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) to β-catenin (MBP-β-catenin) was performed as follows. A 2.3-kb BamHI fragment containing full-length β-catenin was excised from pGEX2T-β-catenin (a kind gift of Dr. David Rimm, Yale University), purified from low melting agarose and inserted into pMAL-C2X (New England BioLabs) that had been digested with BamHI. Proper sequence orientation was confirmed by restriction mapping, and the region encompassing the DNA insert junction was sequenced to confirm that MBP and β-catenin were cloned in frame. MBP-β-catenin was expressed from this plasmid in Escherichia coli strain BL21 grown in 1 liter of Luria broth. Bacteria were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3.5 h and were subsequently lysed by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mmEDTA. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and samples were loaded onto amylose resin columns and washed with lysis buffer. MBP-β-catenin was eluted with 10 mm maltose and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 145 mm NaCl, 12 mm Na2HPO4, and 4 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.2) containing 6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Preparations of MBP-β-catenin were routinely >90% pure (data not shown). A dual-promoter vector expressing both green fluorescent protein (GFP) and myc-tagged IQGAP1 (pcDNA3-IQGAP1-EGFP) was constructed as follows. pcDNA3-IQGAP1 was digested with ApaI, and the 5′-overhanging DNA of the resultant ∼11-kb fragment containing IQGAP1 was made blunt-end with T4 DNA polymerase. pEGFP (CLONTECH) was digested with AseI andHindIII, and the 5′-overhanging DNA of the resultant 1.35-kb fragment containing EGFP was made blunt-ended using Klenow. This fragment was ligated to the ∼11-kb IQGAP1-containing fragment. A plasmid bearing both reading frames in the same orientation was identified by restriction analysis and selected for use in the current study. Expression of GFP (Fig. 5) and myc-IQGAP1 (data not shown) was documented by immunocytochemistry and laser confocal microscopy. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiencies >90% were routinely obtained. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as previously described (14Li Z. Kim S.H. Higgins J.M. Brenner M.B. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37885-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). SW480 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) or TransFast (Promega) according to the manufacturers' instructions. HEK293 and SW480 cells were grown to 80–90% confluency in 6-well dishes, and MCF-7 cells were grown to 40–50% confluency and transfected with 1 μg of total plasmid DNA. After 24 h, cells were processed for analyses as described below. For cells seeded onto 96-well plates or 8-well slides, transfection reagents and DNA volumes were reduced appropriately, according to cell number. MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with either pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-myc-IQGAP1 using FuGENE6. Individual clones were isolated and selected in DMEM containing 800 μg/ml G418. Several clones were isolated and subcloned, and the expression of myc-tagged IQGAP1 in each clone was assessed by Western blotting. One clone, termed MCF-7/IQGAP1-wt3F, which overexpressed IQGAP1 protein 2- to 3-fold compared with vector-transfected MCF-7 cells (data not shown), was used in this work. Firefly luciferase reporter constructs (50 ng) containing either multimerized wild type (pTop-flash) or mutant (pFop-flash) TCF/LEF binding sites (kindly provided by Dr. Sergei Sokol, Harvard Medical School) were transfected into cells grown on 96-well dishes along with 140 ng of vector (pcDNA3) or IQGAP1 constructs in pcDNA3. Plasmid pRL-TK (10 ng), which encodes Renilla reniformis luciferase, was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After 24 h, transfected cells were lysed in 50 μl of Passive Lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, light emission due to firefly luciferase activity was measured using a 300- to 650-nm range photomultiplier tube in a Turner Design 20/20 DLReady luminometer for 12 s. Stop & Glo reagent was added to quench the firefly luciferase, andRenilla (control) luciferase activity in the same sample tube was then measured for an additional 12 s. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency to theRenilla luciferase internal control. pTop-flash, but not pFop-flash, is responsive to co-activation of TCF/LEF by β-catenin (19van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M. Mortin M. Clevers H. Cell. 1997; 88: 789-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Therefore, relative luciferase units were expressed as the amount of pTop-flash-derived luciferase activity divided by the amount from control pFop-flash. For each experimental determination, pFop-flash luciferase activity did not vary by more than 2-fold, and was routinely <5% (never greater than 25%) of pTop-flash activity (data not shown). Where indicated, cells were incubated with 100 μmCGS9343B or an equal volume of ethanol (vehicle) at 25 °C for 30 min prior to lysis. The concentration of CGS9343B used did not reduce the viability of HEK293 or SW480 cells (data not shown). pcDNA3 and IQGAP1 were transiently transfected to equivalent levels into SW480 cells. Twenty-four hours later, cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine in methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed FBS. Cells were chased with DMEM containing 10% FBS and excess cold methionine (0.15 mg/ml) at time 0 and lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm EGTA at the intervals indicated in Figs. 6 and 7 (see below). All manipulations of lysates were performed at 4 °C. Lysates were equalized for total radiolabeled protein by liquid scintillation counting (www.protocol-online.net/molbio/Protein/labeling.htm) and equivalent counts of lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-β-catenin antibodies (Sigma Chemical Co.). Complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. β-Catenin abundance was evaluated by exposing membranes to a PhosphorImager screen for quantification of35S-labeled β-catenin using Molecular Dynamics ImageQuaNT software. The identity of β-catenin was confirmed by probing membranes with anti-β-catenin antibodies. Assessment of the abundance of soluble β-catenin was made using S100 fractions of lysates spun at high speed, essentially as described previously (20Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3546-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). For these analyses, cells were scraped from dishes in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaF, and 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C and homogenized by 30 strokes of a pre-chilled Dounce homogenizer. The crude supernatant was then fractionated at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to generate supernatant (S100) and pellet fractions. The S100 fraction was processed for immunoprecipitation and quantification as described for total β-catenin. Where indicated, cells were incubated with the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin (10 μm) (Calbiochem) or an equal volume of water (vehicle) at 37 °C for 20 h prior to lysis.Figure 7IQGAP1 inhibits the accumulation of a putative degradative intermediate of soluble β-catenin. A, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either vector or IQGAP1. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine and then chased with medium containing cold methionine for 4 h. Cells were lysed at the times indicated, and lysates were subjected to high speed centrifugation. S100 fractions were separated and immunoprecipitated with anti-β-catenin antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Representative phosphorimaging analysis of two independent experimental determinations is depicted. The putative intermediate in the degradation of β-catenin migrates more slowly than unmodified β-catenin, as indicated on the left. B, S100 fractions from non-radiolabeled HEK293 (293) and SW480 (480) cells transiently transfected with IQGAP1 were equalized for protein concentration and analyzed by probing Western blots with anti-β-catenin antibodies. SW480 cells accumulate dramatically increased levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin compared with HEK293 cells. Therefore, the time of exposure for the SW480 sample shown was 10% of that for HEK293, to permit comparison between the two cell lines. C, non-radiolabeled HEK293 cells were incubated with vehicle (water) or 10 μm lactacystin for 20 h. S100 fractions were separated, equalized for protein concentration, and analyzed by probing Western blots with anti-β-catenin antibodies. Cells incubated with lactacystin accumulate dramatically increased levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin (lane 2) compared with those treated with vehicle (lane 1). Therefore, to demonstrate the accumulation of the intermediate β-catenin more clearly, the exposure time of the lactacystin-treated sample inlane 2 was reduced by 90% (lane 3).D, the abundance of the putative β-catenin turnover intermediate depicted in A was quantified relative to the unmodified isoform of β-catenin. Resultant ratios were normalized to the ratio observed at t = 0 for vector-transfected cells and plotted as a function of time after chase. Data represent the mean and variance obtained from two independent experimental determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Competitive binding analysis was performed in vitro using a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein of wild type IQGAP1 (GST-IQGAP1) (14Li Z. Kim S.H. Higgins J.M. Brenner M.B. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37885-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Competition was evaluated by incubating MBP-β-catenin, calmodulin, and GST-IQGAP1 simultaneously, or following sequential addition of MBP-β-catenin or calmodulin to GST-IQGAP1. In the first approach, 500 ng of GST-IQGAP1 protein, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, were incubated with 2 μg of MBP-β-catenin and 4 μg of calmodulin in buffer A containing either 1 mmCa2+ or 1 mm EGTA. Alternatively, GST-IQGAP1 was incubated with MBP-β-catenin, and, after rotating for 60 min at 4 °C, calmodulin was added, and the incubation was continued for another 60 min. Finally, GST-IQGAP1 was incubated with calmodulin for 60 min prior to addition of MBP-β-catenin. All incubations were performed at 4 °C. GST alone (1 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, MBP alone (2 μg), and BSA (4 μg) were used as negative controls for GST-IQGAP1, MBP-β-catenin, and calmodulin, respectively. Where indicated, calmodulin was preincubated with 400 μm CGS9343B or an equal volume of ethanol (vehicle) at 4 °C for 15 min prior to competition. Samples were washed five times in buffer A containing 1 mm Ca2+ or 1 mm EGTA, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF. Blots were probed with anti-β-catenin or anti-calmodulin antibodies, followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). SW480 cells, grown on Permanox plastic slides, were transiently transfected with the dual-promoter vector expressing GFP and myc-tagged IQGAP1. After 24 h, slides were processed for immunocytochemistry essentially as previously described (21Kim S.H., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, slides were incubated for 1 h with mouse anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody, washed four times with PBS, and then incubated with TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 h. After four additional washes with PBS, slides were incubated with 2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) for 5 min and mounted with Aqua Polymount (Polysciences, Inc.). Transfected cells were identified by detection of GFP. Expression of IQGAP1 in GFP-transfected cells was confirmed in separate analysis by incubating slides with mouse anti-myc monoclonal antibody, followed by TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (data not shown). The specificity of immunostaining was established by omitting the primary antibody. Digital micrographs were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope with the MRC-1024 Confocal Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and were imported into a Dell Power Edge 2200 computer for processing using the Lasersharp 3.0 program (Bio-Rad). Confocal data were converted to TIFF files, and nuclear β-catenin was quantified by comparing the intensity of fluorescence of β-catenin in the nucleus with that of total β-catenin in the same cell. The fluorescence of nuclear β-catenin was calculated as the amount of red signal that colocalized with blue signal (DAPI stain) from merged channels acquired at image capture. Data were obtained from multiple cells in at least three different fields from multiple wells, each from at least two independent experimental determinations performed on different days. Densitometry of ECL signals was performed using the National Institutes of Health IMAGE software for PC as supplied by Scion Corp. Protein concentrations were determined with the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test using InStat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Cell viability was assessed by monitoring exclusion of trypan blue (Sigma). Previous studies documented that calmodulin decreased the binding of IQGAP1 to Cdc42 (15Joyal J.L. Annan R.S., Ho, Y.D.

Brenner M.B. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37885-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of calmodulin on the interaction between IQGAP1 and β-catenin was examined by in vitro competition analysis using purified fusion proteins. GST-IQGAP1 was incubated with MBP-β-catenin in the presence of Ca2+, and calmodulin was added 60 min later. Complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose, and the amount of β-catenin bound to IQGAP1 was evaluated by probing blots with anti-β-catenin antibody. MBP-β-catenin bound to GST-IQGAP1 (Fig. 1, A andB, upper panels, lane 2). Binding was specific, because minimal MBP-β-catenin bound to GST alone (Fig. 1,A and B, upper panels, lanes 4 and 8). Addition of calmodulin, but not BSA, displaced 47 ± 3% (mean ± S.E., n = 3,p < 0.005) of the β-catenin pre-bound to GST-IQGAP1 in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 A, upper panel, compare lanes 1 and 2). Moreover, when calmodulin was preincubated with GST-IQGAP1 prior to the addition of β-catenin, the interaction between IQGAP1 and β-catenin was essentially abrogated (Fig. 1 A, upper panel, compare lanes 5 and 6). When calmodulin, β-catenin, and GST-IQGAP1 were incubated simultaneously, binding of β-catenin to IQGAP1 was reduced by ∼50% (Fig.1 A, upper panel, compare lanes 9 and10). Western blots were also probed with anti-calmodulin antibody to ascertain whether β-catenin modulated the binding of calmodulin to IQGAP1. Compared with MBP alone, MBP-β-catenin had no significant effect on the interaction between calmodulin and IQGAP1, regardless of the sequence of addition (Fig. 1 A, lower panels). Importantly, calmodulin did not bind directly to β-catenin (data not shown). Ca2+/calmodulin, but not apo-calmodulin, attenuated the binding of Cdc42 to IQGAP1 (15Joyal J.L. Annan R.S., Ho, Y.D.

To determine whether an analogous situation exists in the competition between calmodulin and β-catenin for binding to IQGAP1, competition experiments similar to those described above were performed with the inclusion of EGTA to chelate Ca2+. Similar to results obtained in the presence of Ca2+, calmodulin displaced 53 ± 6% (mean ± S.E., n = 3, p < 0.005) of the β-catenin pre-bound to GST-IQGAP1 in the presence of EGTA (Fig.1 B, upper panel, compare lanes 1 and2).

We describe a novel binding protein exhibiting unique biochemical properties for Rab5. The Rab5-binding protein enhances GDP-GTP exchange reaction on Rab5 but preferentially interacts with its GTP-bound form. Gel filtration and immunoprecipitation analyses indicate that the Rab5-binding protein functions as a tetramer composed of anti-parallel linkage of two parallel dimers. These results suggest that the newly identified protein may function as an upstream activator and/or downstream effector for Rab5 in endocytic pathway.

Common steps in each pathway include membrane budding to form vesicles, their transport to a particular destination, and the docking and fusion of vesicles to their target membranes. Specificity of vesicular transport seems to be ensured by a number of factors including solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-1 attachment protein receptor molecules and the small GTPase Rab family. The proper pairing and complex formation between target and vesicular solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-1 attachment receptor proteins are responsible for the stable attachment of the vesicles to the target membranes. On the other hand, the small GTPase Rab family, which cycles between GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive states, appears to be involved in the membrane-tethering step in concert with their binding proteins (1Zerial M.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the coupling of these processes are not fully understood. At present, more than 40 members of the Rab family have been identified, and several members appear to be involved in each specific step of endocytic pathways (6Meresse S. Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. J.

Rab5 has been principally implicated in the fusion process of endosomes and is known as a rate-limiting factor for homotypic endosome fusion (10Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J.

After extraction, GDI-Rab5 complex is delivered to the appropriate target membrane where Rab5 is reloaded via a yet unidentified GDI displacement factor (19Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Sumizawa T.

GDP-Rab5 in the target membrane is subsequently activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF). As one of Rab5 stimulators, the 60-kDa Rabex-5, which is homologous to the yeast vacuolar protein-sorting 9 (Vps9) protein, has been identified (21Hama H. Tall G.G. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol.

GTP-Rab5 then interacts with several Rab5 effectors such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, Rabaptin-5, EEA-1, and Rabenosyn-5 to coordinate endosome fusion (23Kurosu H. Katada T. J. Biochem.

Hyman A.A. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The GTP form of Rab5 appeared to be required for sequestering ligands into clathrin-coated vesicles in the endocytosis of the ligand-receptor complexes. Moreover, Rab5 may directly interact with a motor protein to regulate the motility of early endosomes on microtubules. These results suggest that the activation of Rab5 should be coordinated with the receptor activation by ligands, because sequestration of receptor is tightly connected with its activation. In the present study, we report a novel Rab5-binding protein, RIN2, that has a sequence similar to the recently reported Ras-mediated Rab5 stimulator, RIN1 (32Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). RIN2 displays unique biochemical properties compared with well known GEFs for small GTPases. RIN2 preferentially interacts with the GTP form of Rab5 rather than the GDP form, although it enhances the guanine exchange reaction on Rab5. Moreover, gel filtration and immunoprecipitation analyses suggest that RIN2 could form a tetramer composed of anti-parallel linkage of two parallel dimers. These results suggest that RIN2 may function as an upstream activator and/or downstream effector for Rab5 in the endocytic pathway. Monoclonal anti-FLAG(M2) and anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were from commercial sources and of analytical grade. A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed according to the method described previously (33Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar) utilizing the Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH Laboratories). A human leukocyte cDNA library in the pGAD10 vector was screened with Rab5b/Q79L as bait, which was inserted into pGBT9. The cDNA library and bait were co-transformed into the yeast two-hybrid strain HF7c by using a lithium acetate-based method. Positive clones grown on His− medium were selected for activation of HIS3 reporter gene, and β-galactosidase assay was performed as described previously (34Hoshino S. Imai M. Mizutani M. Kikuchi Y.

Biol. 1983; 3: 1625-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The 1575-bp human cDNA encoding the partial sequence of RIN3 (see “Results”) has been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM data bases under accession number AB060338. Deletion mutants of RIN2 (see “Results”) were constructed using a PCR-based strategy. PCR products encoding amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncations of RIN2 were subcloned into pGBT9 in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The two-hybrid vectors obtained were co-transformed into the yeast host strain Y190 or SFY526. Transformed colonies were replated on tryptophan- and leucine-deficient medium. Extension of JC265 cDNA was performed by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end-PCR to a human brain Marathon Ready cDNA (CLONTECH), according to the manufacturer's protocols. To amplify the complete coding sequence of the cDNA, an oligonucleotide corresponding to the upstream sequence of the ATG initiation codon was selected. The 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end-PCR fragment was purified and subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced. The 2685-bp cDNA encoding RIN2 has been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTMData Bank under accession number AB060339. A human multiple tissue RNA blot containing various tissues (2 μg/lane of poly(A) RNA) was obtained from CLONTECH Laboratories. Total cellular RNAs were also prepared from various cell lines using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Poly(A) RNAs were separated from the total RNA by a Poly(A)Tract mRNA Isolation System III (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocols. The isolated poly(A) RNAs (2 μg) were denatured by heating at 65 °C for 5 min in 2.2 mformaldehyde and 50% (v/v) formamide and size-fractionated by 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. The RNAs were transferred directly to nylon membrane filters. An [α-32P]dCTP-labeled fragment corresponding to the amino acid sequence 213–570 of RIN2 was hybridized to the filters overnight at 65 °C in an ExpressHyb Solution (CLONTECH), and the filters were washed and subjected to autoradiography. COS-7 or HeLa cells were transfected with pCMV5 containing the cDNA of FLAG-tagged RIN2. Transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with buffer A consisting of 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 75 mm NaCl, 15 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40 by vortexing. After gently rotated for 15 min at 4 °C, lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were precleared with 20 μl of anti-mouse IgG-agarose resin (50% slurry, American Qualex Inc.) and immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of the agarose resin that had been conjugated with 0.5 μg of the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The resin was washed three times with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and three more times with a buffer consisting of 50 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 7.7 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. FLAG-tagged RIN2 was eluted from the resin with the same buffer containing 1 mg/ml of FLAG peptide. Prenylated Rab5b was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells according to the method described previously (36Horiuchi H. Ullrich O. Bucci C. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), unless 10 μm GDP was added to each buffer. To prepare GTPγS and GDP forms of Rab5b, the purified protein was incubated with the nucleotides (250 μm) at 30 °C for 45 min in 11.2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 110 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.27% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm EDTA, and 2.2 mm MgCl2. The reaction was terminated by adding MgCl2 to the final concentration of 10 mm. [35S]GTPγS binding assay was performed by the filter method as described previously (16Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Araki S. Hata Y. Isomura M. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2333-2337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prenylated Rab5b (10 nm) was incubated with 25 nm[35S]GTPγS (50,000 cpm/pmol) at 30 °C for the indicated times with or without FLAG-tagged RIN2 purified from the transfected HeLa cells in a reaction mixture (50 μl) consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 62.5 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 500 nm GDP, 0.36% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm EDTA, and 15 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mg/ml FLAG peptide. To assay the association between Rab5 and RIN2, the GDP- or GTPγS-bound Rab5b was incubated with the resin (10 μl) conjugating FLAG-RIN2 at 25 °C for 60 min in 0.25 ml of 50 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. The agarose resin was washed four times with a buffer (500 μl) consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. Proteins were eluted from the resin with 30 μl of the same buffer containing 1 mg/ml FLAG peptide. After centrifugation, 24 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 8 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and followed by SDS-PAGE. The concentrations of acrylamide used to separate FLAG-RIN2 and Rab5b are 8 and 15%, respectively. Immunoblotting was performed with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and the anti-Rab5b polyclonal antibody A-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Transfected HeLa cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with buffer A and then diluted with buffer A not containing Nonidet P-40 to lower the concentration of Nonidet P-40 to 0.5%. After gently rotated for 15 min at 4 °C, lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were precleared with Sepharose 4B resins (Amersham Biosciences) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) or anti-Myc 9E10 (Sigma)-conjugated anti-IgG-agarose resin by gently rotating for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads, after washing three times with 0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 were washed three more times with buffer B consisting of 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40. For SDS-PAGE analysis, the beads were mixed with 24 μl of buffer B and 12 μl of 4× sample buffer and boiled for 2 min. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed with anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies. For gel filtration analysis, the beads were washed six times with 0.5 ml of buffer C consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% CHAPS and subsequently eluted with 0.2 ml of buffer C containing 1 mg/ml FLAG peptide by gently vortexing for 1 h at 4 °C. The eluted fraction was diluted with an equal volume of buffer C and applied to a Superdex 200 column (HR 10/30 Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with buffer C. Elution was carried out at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a fraction volume of 0.25 ml. The fractions were concentrated by precipitation with 10% (final) trichloroacetic acid and subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The fractions were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. The elution profile of the column was calibrated with the sizing standards (Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd.) of glutamate dehydrogenase (290 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (142 kDa), enolase (67 kDa), adenylate kinase (32 kDa), and cytochromec (12.4 kDa). We searched for binding proteins for GTP-bound form of Rab5 in a yeast two-hybrid screening system. A human leukocyte cDNA library was screened with the GTPase-deficient mutant Rab5b/Q79L. Screening of 5 × 107 transformants yielded five positive clones that strongly interacted with Rab5b/Q79L. One of the five clones, tentatively termed as HK281, consisted of a 1575-base pair (bp) cDNA encoding 525 amino acids. Further analysis of HK281, together with the isolation of its full-length sequence, is currently under investigation in our laboratory and will be described elsewhere as RIN3. Homology search using data base with FASTA and BLAST revealed that HK281 has sequence similarity with two independent cDNA clones, Ras-interaction/interference 1 (RIN1) and a partially identified RIN1-raleted JC265 (37Han L. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Colicelli J. Nicolette C. Birchmeier C. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Full-length sequence of JC265 was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, with an initiation codon based on the Kozak consensus sequence. The total cDNA encodes an 895-amino acid protein, in which the originally isolated fragment of JC265 corresponds to the amino acid sequence 425–895. This protein contained an SH2 domain, two proline-rich motifs, a Vps9 domain, and Ras association (RA) domain from the amino terminus (see Fig.3A). Because this protein has similar domain architecture and high sequence homology to RIN1, it was henceforth referred to as RIN2. Fig. 1 shows the amino acid alignment of RIN1, RIN2, and the partial sequence of RIN3 (clone HK281).Figure 1Amino acid sequence alignments of RIN family. The sequence alignment among HK281 (partial RIN3), RIN2, and RIN1 (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM, accession number L36463) is shown in the single-letter amino acid code.

As shown in Fig.2A, a 5.1-kb transcript was the most abundant in human heart and kidney with the lowest expression level in the spleen and peripheral blood cells. Furthermore, the 5.1-kb mRNA was also present in human cell lines, HeLa and N-1321 astrocytoma cells, but not in leukemic cell lines, Jurkat and THP-1 cells (Fig. 2B). The expression pattern of RIN2 mRNA was different from those of other RIN family proteins, because RIN1 has been reported to be abundant in brain tissues (39Han L. Wong D. Dhaka A. Afar D. White M. Xie W. Herschman H. Witte O. Colicelli J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4954-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and RIN3 displayed rather ubiquitous distribution including blood cells. 2H. Kajiho and K. Saito, unpublished data. We further examined the interaction between RIN2 and Rab5b in the yeast two-hybrid system. RIN2 sufficiently interacted with Rab5b/WT, in addition to the constitutively active form Rab5b/Q79L (Fig. 3B). However, the dominant negative form Rab5b/S34N exhibited weak interaction with RIN2. Other members of the Rab family including Rab4, Rab7, Rab9, and Rab11 failed to interact with RIN2. Although Ha-Ras was reported to interact with RIN1 in the yeast two-hybrid system (39Han L. Wong D. Dhaka A. Afar D. White M. Xie W. Herschman H. Witte O. Colicelli J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4954-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), neither the wild type (Ha-Ras/WT) nor the active form (Ha-Ras/G12V) associated with RIN2 under our assay conditions. To identify the Rab5-binding region, various deletion mutants of RIN2 were generated and further analyzed in the two-hybrid system (Fig.3C). In addition to the full-length RIN2, its carboxyl-terminal half-sequence (residues 497–895) strongly interacted with Rab5b. Such strong interaction was completely abolished by further deletion of its amino-terminal region (RH domain, see “Discussion”), but not changed by the elimination of RA domain. RH, Vps9, or RA domain alone failed to interact with Rab5b. Thus, the sequence 497–784 of RIN2, which contains both RH and Vps9 domains, appeared to be minimally required for Rab5 binding. We next investigated how the nucleotide-bound state of Rab5 exerts its influence on the interaction with RIN2 in an in vitro binding assay. FLAG-tagged RIN2 immobilized to resins was incubated with GDP- or GTPγS-bound form of Rab5b. The Rab5 binding was estimated by immunoblotting with an anti-Rab5b antibody. As shown in Fig.4 (lanes 3 and 4), the GTPγS form of Rab5b more efficiently bound to RIN2 than did its GDP form, in accordance with the results in the yeast two-hybrid system (see Fig. 3B). Because RIN2 contained the Vps9 domain (the amino acid sequence 648–766) conserved in other characterized GEFs for Rab5 (21Hama H. Tall G.G. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15284-15291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Horiuchi H. Lippe R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), we also investigated whether this binding protein has a GEF activity for Rab5. For the analysis, [35S]GTPγS-binding experiments were performed with FLAG-tagged RIN2 and prenylated Rab5b that had been purified from transfected HeLa cells and baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, respectively (Fig.5A). As shown in Fig.5B, [35S]GTPγS binding to the purified Rab5b was very slow at the physiological concentration (millimolar order) of Mg2+, which resulted from slow GDP dissociation from the small GTPase. Under these conditions, RIN2 markedly accelerated GTPγS binding to Rab5b, although the binding protein itself had no detectable GTPγS binding activity. Interestingly, the binding accelerated by RIN2 was apparently maximal during the first 5 min, and further incubation did not stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange reaction on Rab5b (Fig. 5B). The GTPγS binding to Rab5b was dependent on the concentration of RIN2, and the maximum level reached to the stoichiometric amount (10 nm) of the small GTPase (Fig.5C). These properties observed in RIN2 are quite different from those of other characterized GEFs, which act catalytically on the small GTPases (see “Discussion”). When FLAG-tagged RIN2, purified from transfected HeLa cells, was analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody, we noticed a faint band of more than 200 kDa, in addition to a band corresponding to the RIN2 monomer of 116 kDa (see Fig. 4A, lanes 3–5). Because this band was not detected in control cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 1and 2), we speculated that RIN2 might form a multicomplex. To investigate this possibility, FLAG-tagged RIN2 was applied to a gel filtration column, and fractions eluted from the column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 6, FLAG-tagged RIN2 was eluted at an apparent molecular weight of ∼420,000. There was no detectable protein stoichiometrically associated with RIN2. These results indicate that RIN2 could self-interact to form a homophilic tetramer. To investigate the structural features of RIN2, various forms of FLAG and Myc epitope-tagged RIN2 were expressed in HeLa cells. We first checked whether the self-interaction of full-length RIN2 could be detected with this system. As shown in Fig.7, Myc-tagged RIN2 was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody when co-expressed with FLAG-RIN2 (Fig. 7B, lane 3). FLAG-RIN2 was also detected when Myc-tagged RIN2 was precipitated with the anti-Myc antibody (data not shown). These results support the idea that RIN2 forms a homophilic tetramer. Further experiments were performed with Myc-tagged full-length RIN2 and FLAG-tagged deletion mutants. Under the conditions that each of the FLAG-tagged deletion mutants could be detected with the anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown), the existence of Myc-tagged full-length RIN2 was analyzed (Fig. 8B). Deletion of carboxyl-terminal RH, Vps9, and RA domains and amino-terminal SH2 domain did not diminish the self-interaction (Fig.8B, lanes 1–3), whereas further deletion of amino-terminal proline-rich motifs completely abolished the interaction (lane 4). Moreover, carboxyl-terminal Vps9 and RA domains also interacted with full-length RIN2, although the interaction was rather weak (lanes 5 and 6). We also investigated whether the amino- and carboxyl-terminal parts of RIN2 can interact with themselves or with each other. As shown in Fig.8C, the region between the SH2 domain and proline-rich motifs was responsible for the amino-terminal self-interaction (lanes 1–4). The carboxyl-terminal part of RIN2 also interacted with itself, and the interacting region was assigned to the carboxyl-terminal RA domain (lanes 5–10), although the RH domain fairly interacted with itself (lane 8). These results indicate that RIN2 might form parallel complexes. To clarify whether RIN2 might form anti-parallel complexes, the interaction between the amino and carboxyl termini was further investigated. As shown in Fig.8D, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal interaction appeared to be existent. The region between SH2 domain and proline-rich motifs was required for interaction with carboxyl-terminal RH and Vps9 domains. These results indicate that RIN2 might also form anti-parallel complexes. In the present study, we have identified a novel Rab5-binding protein, RIN2, consisting of 895 amino acids. RIN2 contains SH2 domain, two proline-rich motifs, Vps9 domain, and RA domain, which have also been conserved in RIN1 (39Han L. Wong D. Dhaka A. Afar D. White M. Xie W. Herschman H. Witte O. Colicelli J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4954-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, another Rab5-binding protein, RIN3, partially identified in this study seems to belong to this family, although its amino-terminal sequence has not been determined yet. The alignment of the three proteins allowed us to depict a conserved 100-amino acid sequence in the central region of this family. We termed this conserved region as RH domain (forRIN Homology). This RH domain, together with Vps9 domain, constituted a region necessary for Rab5 binding (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the carboxyl-terminal RA domain of RIN2 was not responsible for the Rab5 binding, consistent with recent report for RIN1 (32Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although the RA domain of RIN1 has been identified as a Ras-binding region (39Han L. Wong D. Dhaka A. Afar D. White M. Xie W. Herschman H. Witte O. Colicelli J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4954-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we could not observe the significant interaction between full-length RIN2 and Ha-Ras under the present conditions (Fig. 2). Another significant feature different from RIN1 is that both RIN2 and RIN3 have an insertion of an extra 120-amino acid sequence between Pro-rich motif and RH domain. The extra sequence exhibits the lowest homology between RIN2 and RIN3. In this report, we show the evidence that RIN2 exists as a tetramer composed of anti-parallel linkage of two parallel dimers. First, RIN2 was eluted at ∼420 kDa in gel filtration column chromatography, approximately four times as large as the apparent molecular mass of the monomer (Fig. 6). Second, self-interaction was observed between different epitope-tagged forms of full-length RIN2 (Fig. 7). Third, amino- and carboxyl-terminal RIN2 fragments could dimerize homogeneously and heterogeneously (Fig. 8). Based on these results, we propose the quaternary structure of RIN2 as indicated in Fig. 9. Recent reports indicate that several proteins implicated in early endocytic pathways form homo-multimeric complexes. For example, Eps15, a phosphorylation substrate of the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase forms a tetramer consisting of parallel and anti-parallel dimers (40Cupers P. ter Haar E. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33430-33434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Tebar F. Confalonieri S. Di Carter R.E. Fiore P.P. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15413-15418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which resembles the proposed structure of RIN2. As for Rab5 effectors, Rabaptin-5 and EEA-1 has been respectively shown to form dimers (42Vitale G. Rybin V. Christoforidis S. Thornqvist P. McCaffrey M. Stenmark H. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 43Callaghan J. Simonsen A. Gaullier J.M. Toh B.H. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is suggested that Rab5 can be dimerized depending on the GTP-bound conformation (44Daitoku H. Isida J. Fujiwara K. Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 8: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar). RIN2 may function as a component of early endocytic machinery in the form of homophilic complex, in coordination with other oligomeric complexes (45McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In the present study, we revealed that RIN2 stimulates a guanine nucleotide exchange reaction on Rab5 (Fig. 4) and preferentially interacts with the GTP-bound activated form of the small GTPase (Fig. 5). These RIN2 properties are somewhat intriguing, because other identified GEFs for Rab5 including RIN1 have been reported to interact with the GDP form (21Hama H. Tall G.G. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15284-15291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 32Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, such RIN2-like properties have been also observed in a complex of Rabex-5 and Rabaptin-5. Rabex-5, previously identified as other Rab5-GEF (22Horiuchi H. Lippe R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), forms a tight complex with Rabaptin-5, which specifically interacts with GTP-Rab5 to stabilize its activated form (26Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 46Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra M.C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Rabaptin-5 forms a homodimer in the multicomplex (42Vitale G. Rybin V. Christoforidis S. Thornqvist P. McCaffrey M. Stenmark H. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and the complex formation between Rabaptin-5 and Rabex-5 is essentially required for endosome fusion (47Lippe R. Miaczynska M. Rybin V. Runge A. Zerial M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, the unique properties of RIN2 found here may resemble to that of the Rabaptin-5-Rabex-5 complex. The unique properties of RIN2 may be responsible for the amplification of Rab5-mediated signaling. In the endocytic pathway, RIN2 would translocate to a particular subcellular compartment by its association with the GTP form of Rab5 and catalyze re-activation of the inactivated GDP form, thereby causing the amplification of cellular responses induced by the small GTPase. Such a mechanism has been found previously (48Liao Y. Satoh T. Gao X. Jin T.G. Hu C.D. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28478-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 49Liao Y. Kariya K. Hu C.D. Shibatohge M. Goshima M. Okada T. Watari Y. Gao X. Jin T.G. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37815-37820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) in another GEF for the small GTPase Rap1, RA-GEF. Alternatively, the properties of RIN2 may suggest that it functions not only as an upstream GEF but also as a downstream effector for Rab5. This idea could be supported by our present data. The acceleration of nucleotide exchange reached maximum within a few minutes, and further incubation did not stimulate the exchange reaction (Fig.5B). Such features of RIN2 may be explicable by its nucleotide preference for GTP-bound Rab5. We speculate that RIN2, which accomplished the nucleotide exchange on Rab5, was subsequently bound to the activated Rab5, leading to the formation of a tight ternary complex (GTP-Rab5b-RIN2). Consequently, other GDP-Rab5 molecules that remained in the reaction mixture were unable to associate with RIN2. Thus, it is likely that RIN2 may function to Rab5 stoichiometrically rather than catalytically. In the present study, we have not investigated whether the RIN2 region responsible for the GEF activity is distinguishable from the binding site for GTP-Rab5. Furthermore, we could not precisely estimate the integrity and protein stability of RIN2 used in the GEF assay, because it was immunologically purified from transfected HeLa cells. Further experiments under well established conditions should be required for clarifying these points. Tall et al. (32Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) recently reported that RIN1 enhances its guanine exchange activity on Rab5 by its interaction with Ha-Ras. Although the direct interaction between RIN2 and Ha-Ras was not observed in the present yeast two-hybrid system, we cannot totally rule out the possibility that the GEF activity of RIN2 may be stimulated by a certain member of the Ras family other than Ha-Ras. Alternatively, the GEF function of RIN2 would be regulated by receptor-mediated signaling, because this GEF contains SH2 and Pro-rich domains, which are capable of interacting with a Tyr-phosphorylated sequence and SH3 domain, respectively. Further investigation would be also required for revealing the cross-talk between the cell signaling and the membrane trafficking. We are grateful to Dr. David W. Russell for generous gifts of pCMV5 vector."

Following re-crystallization at neutral pH, the crystals were identified as the chitinase-like protein Ym1, expressed in organs of the lymphoreticular system, the lung, and distal stomach. Ym1 was shown to be a neutrophil granule protein and to have weak β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, indicating that it might contribute to the digestion of glycosaminoglycans. Crystal formation is likely to be a function of excess neutrophil turnover at sites of inflammation in the chronic granulomatous disease mouse. Failure to remove subcutaneous Ym1 crystals injected into knockout mice indicates that a failure of digestion may also contribute to crystallization.

The commonest autosomal recessive cause of CGD, affecting 25% of patients (1Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes F. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), is caused by defects in the p47phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase. We have created a mouse model of CGD by disrupting this subunit in order to increase the understanding of the biochemistry and cell biology of this disease. During histological review of our p47phox knockout (p47phox −/−) mouse, we discovered crystals in the lung of aged mice, which was not described in the report of the original p47phox −/− mouse in 1995 (2Jackson S.H. Gallin J.I. Holland S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).Recently Ym1, a member of a family of mammalian proteins (Table I) that shares sequences with lower organism chitinases, has been described as crystallizing in the lungs of three immunodeficient mice as follows: the moth-eaten mouse, the CD40L-deficient mouse, and a transgenic mouse with lung-specific human tumor necrosis factor receptor expression (3Guo L. Johnson R.S. Schuh J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8032-8037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Increased expression of Ym2, a Ym1 splice variant (4Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M.

These were previously thought to be Charcot-Leyden-like crystals, but it now seems likely that they are composed of Ym1 protein.Table IMammalian “chitinases” molecular weight and cellular origin (where expression known)NameMassCellular originkDaHuman YKL-391-aNCBI protein database accession number AAC50597.43,039Articular chondrocyte (53)Human HCgp-39 (YKL-40)1-bNCBI protein database accession number AAA16074.42,613Macrophage (54); neutrophil (36); articular chondrocyte (55)Human oviductal glycoprotein1-cNCBI protein database accession number AAA86946.1.75,421NKHuman chitotriosidase1-dNCBI protein database accession number AAC50246.1.51,681Monocyte (39)Human TSA1902-L1-eNCBI protein database accession number BAA86980.1.40,082NKMouse AMCase1-fNCBI protein database accession number AAG60018.50,000NKMouse ECF-L1-gNCBI protein database accession number BAA13458.2.44,448NKMouse Ym11-hNCBI protein database accession number AAB62394.2.44,528Neutrophil; gastric epithelia (6)Mouse BRP391-iNCBI protein database accession number CAA63603.1.43,001NKMouse oviductin1-jNCBI protein database accession number Q62010.78,807NKNK, not known.1-a NCBI protein database accession number AAC50597.1-b NCBI protein database accession number AAA16074.1-c NCBI protein database accession number AAA86946.1.1-d NCBI protein database accession number AAC50246.1.1-e NCBI protein database accession number BAA86980.1.1-f NCBI protein database accession number AAG60018.1-g NCBI protein database accession number BAA13458.2.1-h NCBI protein database accession number AAB62394.2.1-i NCBI protein database accession number CAA63603.1.1-j NCBI protein database accession number Q62010. Open table in a new tab Ym1 mRNA is expressed in the spleen and lung and a highly homologous gene, ym2, in the thymus, stomach, and kidney (4Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The distribution of Ym1 protein within the cells of these and other tissues has not been determined, although it has been assumed to be a macrophage protein because it was first discovered in a peritoneal macrophage cDNA library (10Chang N.C.

Recently, enhanced macrophage ym1 gene expression, mediated by a homologue of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, has been found associated with Th2-cytokine inducing helminth infection (11Falcone F.H.

The function in vivo is unknown, although recently the same researchers (12Sun Y.J. Chang N.C. Hung S.I. Chang A.C. Chou C.C. Hsiao C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17507-17514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have both deduced the protein structure, which contains a saccharide-binding site, and shown that Ym1 functions as a lectin, binding multivalent hexosamines and heparin (10Chang N.C.

Ym1 may have weak chitinase activity, thus cleaving several moieties of β-1,4-linkedN-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) (3Guo L. Johnson R.S. Schuh J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8032-8037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and therefore may have a defensive role. Finally, the protein has been shown to be chemotactic for eosinophils (13Owhashi M. Arita H. Hayai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and high concentrations are associated with eosinophil recruitment in vivo (11Falcone F.H. Loke P. Zang X. MacDonald A.S. Maizels R.M. Allen J.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5348-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrate that p47phox −/− murine pulmonary crystals are indeed Ym1 and that the protein is stored in neutrophil granules. In addition, we show that pure Ym1 can function as a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and not a chitinase. We show that Ym1 crystals easily form in vitro and speculate that excessive Ym1 release during acute inflammation causes crystal formation in vivo.DISCUSSIONLungs from aged p47phox −/− mice showed patchy consolidation with a heavy intra-alveolar chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate composed predominantly of macrophages together with numerous crystals, which we identified as the chitinase-like protein Ym1. We also demonstrated that similar crystals within the inflamed biliary tree were Ym1. The protein was confirmed as Ym1 and not the very similar protein ECF-L (13Owhashi M. Arita H. Hayai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) because the mass of the tryptic peptide 102–117 was 1722.82 Da, corresponding to proline at position 106 and not serine as in ECF-L. It is also not derived from the highly homologous gene ym2 (4Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), because the mass of the tryptic peptide 220–231 was 1343.70 Da, which corresponds to aspartate at position 220 and not asparagine as in Ym2.Ym1 has been assumed to be macrophage-derived (5Webb D.C. McKenzie A.N.J. Foster P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41969-41976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) because it was sequenced from an activated peritoneal macrophage cDNA library (10Chang N.C. Hung S.I. Hwa K.Y. Kato I. Chen J.E. Liu C.H. Chang A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17497-17506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and microscopically Ym1 crystals are associated with macrophages (3Guo L. Johnson R.S. Schuh J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8032-8037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, we have shown Ym1 to be mainly a neutrophil granule protein. What is the explanation for this disparity? Neutrophils have a circulation half-life of about 6–8 h and are the predominant cell type during the first 24 h of an inflammatory stimulus (32Lord B.I. Molineux G. Pojda Z. Souza L.M. Mermod J.J. Dexter T.M. Blood. 1991; 77: 2154-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They apoptose and are phagocytosed and digested by macrophages, which have a life span of weeks to months (33Green G.M. Jakab G.J. Low R.B. Davis G.S. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1977; 115: 479-514PubMed Google Scholar), and can very rapidly degrade apoptotic neutrophils (up to 1 neutrophil/macrophage/30 min) (34Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.M. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Extracellular non-degradable crystalline Ym1, or Ym1 contained within apoptotic neutrophils, will appear to be mainly associated with macrophages. This is compatible with the low concentration of Ym1 in thioglycolate-induced peritoneal macrophages, where the majority of cells will have been recently synthesized from bone marrow promonocytes and blood monocytes (35Van-Furth R. Diesselhoff-den D.M. Mattie H. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 138: 1314-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and therefore will not have had the opportunity to phagocytose many neutrophils. It is noteworthy that another member of this family of proteins, YKL-40, has been found in the specific granules of human neutrophils (36Volck B. Price P.A. Johansen J.S. Sorensen O. Benfield T.L. Nielsen H.J. Calafat J. Borregaard N. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1998; 110: 351-360PubMed Google Scholar) and that chitinase activity in human leukocytes has been shown to be mainly from granulocytes (37Escott G.M. Adams D.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4770-4773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that Ym1 is expressed also by eosinophils because the experimental induction of murine macrophage crystalline inclusions has been described after the intraperitoneal injection of human eosinophil-rich granulocytes (38Ali B.A. Shortland J.R. Hudson G. Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1981; 62: 662-668PubMed Google Scholar), and both alveolar macrophage crystals in C57/BL6 mice (9Huffnagle G.B. Boyd M.B. Street N.E. Lipscomb M.F. J.

Therefore, it can be classified as a β-N-acetylglucosaminidase rather than a chitinase (40Flach J. Pilet P.E. Jolles P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) which is compatible with the mutated chitinase active site of Ym1(41). The minimal activity with MU-(GlcNAc)2 and MU-(GlcNAc)3 shows that Ym1 can not cleaveN-acetylhexosamine monomers sequentially from the same molecule of MU-(GlcNAc)2 or MU-(GlcNAc)3, as has been described for chitinase A and B of S. marcescens(31Brurberg M.B. Nes I.F. Eijsink V.G. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Contrary to our findings, Guo et al (3Guo L. Johnson R.S. Schuh J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8032-8037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) recently suggested that Ym1 also could cleave MU-(GlcNAc)2,3. However, it is possible that their preparation contained cellular debris including chitinases of a similar molecular weight as Ym1 (see Table I) or enzymes capable of sequential β-N-acetylglucosaminidase or exo-chitinase activity, allowing Ym1 to release 4MU from MU-(GlcNAc)1. Such problems in distinguishing between exo- and endo-chitinase activity have been described (42Ren Y. Wee K.E. Chang F.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We used purified Ym1, and therefore the enzyme kinetics are specific for Ym1. It is noteworthy that the enzyme activity had the same pH dependence as shown recently for Ym1 binding to certain (oligo)saccharides with a free amine group (10Chang N.C. Hung S.I. Hwa K.Y. Kato I. Chen J.E. Liu C.H. Chang A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17497-17506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), although binding and cleavage sites of the protein may be distinct. After invasion by chitin containing microorganisms, chitin and other foreign antigens must be digested to prevent a granulomatous tissue response. Chitin can be degraded with a binary enzyme system using a combination of a chitinase and an β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (31Brurberg M.B. Nes I.F. Eijsink V.G. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The weak activity demonstrated here may underestimate in vivokinetics because functionality may require synergy with other proteins, shown previously for chitinase (43Davies D.A. Pope A.M. Nature. 1978; 273: 235-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).What can be deduced about protein crystallization from our findings? First, crystals may form due to a high local concentration of Ym1 secondary to neutrophil degranulation during repeated episodes of inflammation. This is analogous to the deposition of α1-antitrypsin variants within the liver, where polymerization of the protein is enhanced during episodes of inflammation (44Parmar J.S. Lomas D.A. J. R. Coll. Physicians Lond. 2000; 34: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar), and to Charcot-Leyden crystal formation, where lysophospholipase, a granule protein comprising 10% of an eosinophil's protein (45Ackerman S.J. Corrette S.E. Rosenberg H.F. Bennett J.C. Mastrianni D.M. Nicholson-Weller A. Weller P.F. Chin D.T. Tenen D.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 456-468PubMed Google Scholar), crystallizes during asthmatic inflammatory reactions. In support of this, Ym1 crystals increased with age and were found within the lung, a major portal of antigen entry, in peripheral and basal sites, suggesting a response to inhaled matter; and increased Ym1 expression and Ym1 crystals occurred at extrapulmonary sites of inflammation. Second, a mildly acidic pH milieu within the CGD phagolysosome may contribute to crystallization. Inflammation causes a mildly acidic extracellular environment (46Hunt J.F. Fang K. Malik R. Snyder A. Malhotra N. Platts M.T. Gaston B. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), and the phagolysosome of the human CGD neutrophil has been shown to be abnormally acidic (6 min post-phagocytosis, pH 6.1 cf. pH 7.4 in control subjects (47Segal A.W. Geisow M. Garcia R. Harper A. Miller R. Nature. 1981; 290: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar)). Assuming similar pH changes occur in the murine CGD phagolysosome, the concentration of Ym1 protein may exceed the crystallization threshold due to excessive degranulation. There is 1 ng of Ym1 in 10,000 murine neutrophils; the volume of granules in one human neutrophil is 52.5 fl (48); assuming human and murine neutrophils have a similar granule volume, the granule concentration of Ym1 is 1.9 μg/μl. At neutral pH, Ym1 crystallizes in vitro when the concentration exceeds 0.4 μg/μl. Third, crystalline Ym1 may be resistant to degradation within the CGD macrophage due to absence of functional NADPH oxidase. This is likely because skin injection experiments showed that only wild-type mice were able to clear Ym1 crystals from their subcutis. In contrast to the CYP1A2-null B6, 129 mouse, no protein crystals were seen within the stomach. This may be due to the extreme acidic environment and/or a lower Ym2 concentration in the p47phox −/− mouse.It is interesting that a protein that may play a role in the digestion of bacteria and fungi is found as crystal deposits in the CGD mouse, which is susceptible to repeated bacterial and fungal infections. Could a similar phenomenon occur in humans? There are no reports of similar crystals in human patients with CGD. After comprehensive searches against protein, nucleotide, and expressed sequence tag data bases using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)), no known human homologue for Ym1 was found. Although there is 61% protein sequence homology to a human lung gene, TSA1902 (50Saito A. Ozaki K. Fujiwara T. Nakamura Y. Tanigami A. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the human gene has a different murine homologue called acidic mammalian chitinase, recently reported by Boot et al. (51Boot R.G. Blommaart E.F.C. Swart E. Ghauharali-van der Vlugt K. Bijl N. Moe C. Place A. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6770-6778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Acidic mammalian chitinase is similar to Ym1/Ym2 because both proteins are expressed predominantly by gastric epithelium with maximum activity in an acidic milieu. Ym1/Ym2 may persist in the mouse to protect against mouse-specific microorganisms in the lung or stomach, because mice have evolved in habitats that contain a high concentration of chitin-containing fungal spores. The function of Ym1 is likely to be digestive rather than fungicidal, because neither Ym1 nor anti-Ym1 has anti-C. albicans activity in vitro at an acidic or normal pH (data not shown).The function of Ym1 is still unclear but by defining the cellular location as the neutrophil granule and gastric epithelium, it is plausible to suggest that it has a major role in digestion during acute inflammation. Although knockout mice may help determine the function of Ym1, redundancy within this family of proteins may mean that a specific deficiency can be tolerated without a phenotypic change. This is known to be the case with human chitotriosidase deficiency (52Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Verhoek M. Strijland A. Bliek J. de-Meulemeester T.M. Mannens M.M. Aerts J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25680-25685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It will be important to study chitinase/β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity in the human CGD macrophage and neutrophil because it is possible that similar proteins to Ym1 are sequestered, which could enhance the inflammatory reaction seen in these patients.

The commonest autosomal recessive cause of CGD, affecting 25% of patients (1Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes F. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), is caused by defects in the p47phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase. We have created a mouse model of CGD by disrupting this subunit in order to increase the understanding of the biochemistry and cell biology of this disease. During histological review of our p47phox knockout (p47phox −/−) mouse, we discovered crystals in the lung of aged mice, which was not described in the report of the original p47phox −/− mouse in 1995 (2Jackson S.H.

Johnson R.S. Schuh J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8032-8037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Increased expression of Ym2, a Ym1 splice variant (4Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M.

Gastric hyalinosis in CYP1A2-null B6, 129 mice has recently been identified as Ym2 (6Ward J.M. Yoon M. Anver M.R. Haines D.C. Kudo G. Gonzalez F.J. Kimura S. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and in the same study, anti-Ym1 immunoreactivity demonstrated to pulmonary macrophage crystals. Unidentified pulmonary crystalline deposits have been described in other transgenic, immune-deficient mice (7Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Wang Z. Chen Q. Geba G.P. Wang J. Zhang Y. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar) and in certain strains of immune-competent mice, particularly on a 129Sv or C57BL/6 background (8Murray A.B. Luz A. Vet. Pathol. 1990; 27: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), especially during experimental chronic pulmonary infection (9Huffnagle G.B. Boyd M.B. Street N.E. Lipscomb M.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2393-2400PubMed Google Scholar). These were previously thought to be Charcot-Leyden-like crystals, but it now seems likely that they are composed of Ym1 protein. NK, not known. Ym1 mRNA is expressed in the spleen and lung and a highly homologous gene, ym2, in the thymus, stomach, and kidney (4Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The distribution of Ym1 protein within the cells of these and other tissues has not been determined, although it has been assumed to be a macrophage protein because it was first discovered in a peritoneal macrophage cDNA library (10Chang N.C.

Recently, enhanced macrophage ym1 gene expression, mediated by a homologue of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, has been found associated with Th2-cytokine inducing helminth infection (11Falcone F.H.

The function in vivo is unknown, although recently the same researchers (12Sun Y.J. Chang N.C. Hung S.I. Chang A.C. Chou C.C. Hsiao C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17507-17514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have both deduced the protein structure, which contains a saccharide-binding site, and shown that Ym1 functions as a lectin, binding multivalent hexosamines and heparin (10Chang N.C.

Ym1 may have weak chitinase activity, thus cleaving several moieties of β-1,4-linkedN-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) (3Guo L. Johnson R.S. Schuh J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8032-8037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and therefore may have a defensive role. Finally, the protein has been shown to be chemotactic for eosinophils (13Owhashi M. Arita H. Hayai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and high concentrations are associated with eosinophil recruitment in vivo (11Falcone F.H. Loke P. Zang X. MacDonald A.S. Maizels R.M. Allen J.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5348-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that p47phox −/− murine pulmonary crystals are indeed Ym1 and that the protein is stored in neutrophil granules. In addition, we show that pure Ym1 can function as a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and not a chitinase. We show that Ym1 crystals easily form in vitro and speculate that excessive Ym1 release during acute inflammation causes crystal formation in vivo. DISCUSSIONLungs from aged p47phox −/− mice showed patchy consolidation with a heavy intra-alveolar chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate composed predominantly of macrophages together with numerous crystals, which we identified as the chitinase-like protein Ym1. We also demonstrated that similar crystals within the inflamed biliary tree were Ym1. The protein was confirmed as Ym1 and not the very similar protein ECF-L (13Owhashi M. Arita H. Hayai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) because the mass of the tryptic peptide 102–117 was 1722.82 Da, corresponding to proline at position 106 and not serine as in ECF-L. It is also not derived from the highly homologous gene ym2 (4Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilb"

To identify requirements for STAT3-Jun cooperation, we elucidated the role of protein kinases that affect both transcription factors. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway was found capable of down-regulating both STAT3- and c-Jun-dependent transcription, resulting in derepression of FasR transcription. Conversely, inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling via the specific pharmacological inhibitor LY294002 up-regulated AP1/Jun- and STAT-dependent transcriptional activities, resulting in suppression of the FasR promoter activities and decreased FasR surface expression. PI3K-AKT's ability to affect FasR transcription was not observed in c-jun null fibroblasts, suggesting that c-Jun is required for PI3K/AKT-mediated regulation of FasR transcription. Interestingly, the dominant negative form of Rac1 (RacN17) was also efficient in relieving FasR expression, suggesting that the increase in FasR expression following AKT stimuli could be mediated via AKT ability to elicit suppression of Rac1, which in turn decreases JNK activities and c-Jun phosphorylation. Overall, our findings demonstrate that through its negative effects on both c-Jun and STAT3, the PI3K-AKT pathway disrupts cooperation between c-Jun and STAT3, which is required for silencing the FasR promoter, resulting in increased expression of surface FasR and concomitant sensitization to FasL-mediated programmed cell death.

PI3K is among signaling pathways implicated in the regulation of FasR responses (25Holmstrom T.H. Eriksson J.E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 121-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UV irradiation-mediated activation of PI3K signaling via epidermal growth factor receptors in human skin provides an example for physiological stimuli that utilize the PI3K/AKT cascade to affect the degree of damage-induced cell death (26Wan Y.S. Wang Z.Q. Shao Y. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 461-466PubMed Google Scholar). UV, via generation of hydrogen peroxide, induces AKT phosphorylation (27Huang C., Li, J. Ding M.

Overall increase in basal levels of PI3K/AKT activity coincided with tumor cell ability to exhibit resistance to UV and ionizing radiation (28Cataldi A. Zauli G., Di Pietro R. Castorina S. Rana R.

Whereas regulation offas transcription is mediated by both constitutive and inducible regulatory pathways, down-regulation of Fas expression in advanced human melanoma-derived cell lines was found to be mediated by cooperation of STAT3 with c-Jun, a process that can be most clearly identified in advanced tumors. Interference with such cooperation through the use of dominant negative forms of either STAT3 or c-Jun efficiently restored transcription and surface expression of FasR (38Ivanov V.N. Bhoumik a.

Here we demonstrate that AKT is also capable of altering the activities of transcription factors that play important roles in regulating FasR expression. In demonstrating that AKT signaling plays an important role in controlling FasR expression, we document a novel layer of regulation that links the PI3K-AKT pathway with Fas-mediated death in tumor cells, which represents an important mechanism in the control of tumor development and progression.

Transfected cultures were subjected to selection in G418 (200 μg/ml) or puromycin (2 μg/ml) as indicated under “Results,” and a mixed population of resistant cells was analyzed. The luciferase reporter gene containing five TRE elements from the c-Jun promoter (5×Jun2-tk-Luc) or three GAS elements from the Ly6E gene (3×Ly6E-Luc) as target sequences for c-Jun and STAT3, respectively, were previously described (38Ivanov V.N.

Transient transfection of different reporter constructs (0.5 μg) together with expression vectors and pCMV-βgal (0.25 μg) into 5 × 105 melanoma cells was performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Proteins were prepared for β-galactosidase and luciferase analysis 18 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized based on β-galactosidase levels. Cells were exposed to UVC at 60 J/m2 as previously described (54Ivanov V.N. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14079-14089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). FasL (25–50 ng/ml) was used in combination with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). Apoptosis was assessed by quantifying the percentage of hypodiploid nuclei undergoing DNA fragmentation (55Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4415) Google Scholar). Surface expression of Fas was determined using anti-Fas-PE Ab (Pharmingen). Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using the CellQuest program. Melanoma cells (5 × 105) were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors together with marker plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (pGFP; 1 and 0.25 μg, respectively) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, surface Fas expression in GFP-positive cells was determined by staining with PE-anti-Fas Ab and flow cytometry. For apoptosis studies, cells were irradiated with UVC (60 J/m2) 24 h after transfection and 18 h later were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell lysates (50–100 μg of protein) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and processed according to the standard protocols. The Abs used were anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473), anti-phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser73), anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), and anti-phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), and corresponding control Abs were obtained from Cell Signaling and used at dilutions of 1:1000 to 1:3000. The secondary Abs (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:5000). Signals were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Double-stranded biotinylated oligonucleotides used in this study were derived in wild type and mutant configurations from the Fas promoter sequences: WT (Biotin-AAT GCC CAT TTG TGC AAC GAA CCC TGA CTC CTT CCT), mutated GAS, and AP1 sites (Biotin-AAT GCC CAT TTG TGC TTC GAA CCC AAA CTC CTT CCT). Nuclear proteins were prepared, as previously described (56Ivanov V.N. Nikolic-Zugic J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8558-8566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins (400 μg) were incubated with biotinylated oligonucleotides in solution followed by coupling of oligonucleotides and their bound proteins to Streptavidin-agarose (Stratagene); bead-bound material was subjected to extensive washes before specifically associated proteins were eluted in SDS-loading buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with Abs against phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), phospho-c-Jun (Ser73), and corresponding control Abs. Cooperation between STAT3 and c-Jun suppresses Fas receptor (FasR) transcription and subsequent FasR expression on the cell surface, as often seen in advanced tumors. To elucidate mechanisms underlying the cooperation between two ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that results in silencing FasR transcription and expression, we explored the possible role of protein kinases, which affect both STAT3 and c-Jun. To this end, we monitored the effect of pharmacological inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT pathway (LY294002) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (PD98059) as well as of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38/JNK (SB203580) and JAK (AG490) on cell surface expression of Fas receptor (FasR) (Fig.1 A). Of the inhibitors used, only LY294002 resulted in a marked decrease (60%) in surface FasR expression in WM9 and WM793 cells and to a lesser extent (20%) in LU1205 cells. These results imply that the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade positively regulates expression of FasR and that inhibition of this pathway results in decreased FasR expression on the cell surface. Additionally, a notable decrease of surface Fas expression after LY294002 treatment was observed for the early melanoma cell lines WM1650 and WM35 (not shown). It is of interest that LU1205 cells also exhibited increases in FasR levels in response to inhibition of p38/JNK, suggesting that p38/JNK negatively regulates FasR expression in these cells. Western blot analysis confirmed down-regulation of total Fas levels in these cell lines (not shown). The three melanomas selected for the initial analysis included early phase melanoma cells WM9 and WM793 and the late phase melanoma LU1205 cells. Of these cell lines, LU1205 was found to express a truncated form of the PTEN protein indicative of mutated PTEN (data not shown). Mutated PTEN is expected to result in constitutively active PI3K/AKT signaling, which would explain the limited inhibition observed in the LU1205 cells after LY294002 treatment.Figure 1The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 down-regulates surface Fas expression and Fas promoter activities in human melanoma cell lines. A, effect of inhibition of distinct signaling pathways by PD98059 (50 μm), AG490 (50 μm), LY294002 (50 μm), and SB203580 (5 μm) on Fas surface expression in the indicated melanoma cell cites. Cell surface expression was determined by flow cytometric analysis (monitored via MFI). B, LU1205 and WM9 melanoma cells were transfected with 5×Jun2-Luc (a reporter construct specific for AP-1-dependent transcription), 3×Ly6E-Luc (a reporter specific for STAT-dependent transcription), and −460 Fas-Luc in the presence of pCMV-β-gal. Cells were untreated (control) or treated with LY294002 (50 μm) for an additional 6 h. The data shown reflect changes over the control nontreated cultures. In all cases, the normalized ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase is shown. C, WM9 cells were transiently transfected with −460 Fas-Luc and mutated variants of this construct in the presence of pCMV-β-gal. LY294002 (50 μm) was added to the cultures 16 h after transfection for an additional 6 h before cells were harvested and proteins were analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. The normalized ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase is shown. D, analysis of STAT3 and c-Jun expression and phosphorylation in WM9 and WM793 melanoma cells.

Using the luciferase reporter gene that is under the control of AP1/c-Jun (5×Jun2-tk-Luc) or STAT (3×Ly6E-Luc) target sequences, we observed an increase (2–3-fold) in the level of STAT and Jun-dependent transcriptional activities in both WM9 and LU1205 cells after LY294002 treatment. Increased Jun and STAT transcriptional activities coincided with a 50–80% decrease in FasR-Luc activities (Fig. 1 B). These findings suggest that PI3K elicits negative regulatory effects on both STAT and c-Jun transcription factors, as inhibition of this signaling cascade results in increased transcriptional activities of both transcription factors and concomitant suppression of the FasR promoter. Using WT and mutated forms of the FasR promoter, we further monitored the effect of PI3K/AKT signaling on FasR promoter activity. FasR promoter mutated on the GAS element (which serves as the target sequence for STAT proteins) exhibited a 40% inhibition in FasR-Luc activity compared with the 80% inhibition seen with the WT promoter following LY294002 treatment (Fig. 1 C). This finding suggests that the GAS element contributes to PI3K-mediated derepression of FasR transcription. Mutation within the AP1 site completely abolished the ability of LY294002 to suppress FasR transcription, suggesting that AP1 is essential for PI3K/AKT-mediated derepression of FasR promoter activity. Similarly, deletion of the AP1 and GAS elements from the FasR promoter sequences attenuated LY294002's ability to suppress FasR transcription, resulting in increased FasR transcription in the WM9 melanoma cells. Unlike AP1 and GAS elements, the NF-κB site did not appear to play a role in the regulation of FasR promoter by AKT/PI3K, since mutations of NF-κB binding site did not affect LY294002's ability to suppress FasR promoter activities (Fig.1 C). Together, this analysis reveals that PI3K/AKT utilizes transcription factor binding to the AP1 and GAS motives on the FasR promoter to mediate derepression of the promoter activities in these melanoma cells. Analysis of STAT3 and c-Jun phosphorylation revealed a noticeable increase in the serine phosphorylation of both c-Jun and STAT3 in cells that were treated with LY294002 (Fig. 1 D). Since an increase in serine phosphorylation of both transcription factors is a prerequisite for thei"
https://openalex.org/W1987409389,"Malignant melanoma is a cancer whose incidence is rising rapidly, but the mechanism by which normal melanocytes become malignant <i>in vivo</i> is still little understood. In the course of melanoma progression, a fraction of cells often becomes depigmented, which reflects the loss of the balance between mitogenic activities and differentiation in those pigment cells. A key factor involved in differentiation in pigment cells is mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, because both activation and inhibition of MAPK signaling is known to correlate with differentiation, its function in pigment cells is still unclear. We investigated the role of MAPK signaling in pigment cells using the melanoma-inducing receptor tyrosine kinase Xmrk. Xmrk signaling in mouse melanocytes suppressed differentiation and induced a transformed phenotype. We found that this was based on sustained MAPK activation caused by low and transient expression of MAPK-phosphatase MKP-1. The Src kinase p59<sup>Fyn</sup>was thereby identified as being crucial for the receptor-mediated suppression of differentiation by down-regulating MKP-1 expression. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of regulating the balance between differentiation and proliferation based on a Src kinase-modified MAPK activity. Moreover, they point to a new role for Src kinases in dedifferentiation and transformation of pigment cells."

Oncoviral proteins of transforming DNA tumor viruses have evolved to induce viral replication in resting host cells. They do so by selective interaction with a restricted number of cellular proteins that govern the cell cycle, differentiation, or cell survival. The same cellular proteins are often mutated in various cancers demonstrating their importance in cellular growth control. An example of such a viral oncoprotein that interferes with the function of critical growth regulators is the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen EBNA2. 1The abbreviations used are:EBNAEpstein-Barr nuclear antigenRbretinoblastomaBMPbone morphogenetic proteinaaamino acid(s)TGFβtransforming growth factor β EBNA2 interferes with transcriptional regulation and is required for B-cell immortalization by the Epstein-Barr virus. Association of EBNA2 with cellular transcription factors such as CBF1/RBP-Jκ or PU-1 activates cellular and viral target genes by EBNA2-mediated recruitment of the pre-initiation complex, histone acetyltransferases, as well as the SWI·SNF remodeling complex (1Rowe D.T.

Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen retinoblastoma bone morphogenetic protein amino acid(s) transforming growth factor β Another eminent example and an invaluable tool for unraveling proliferation and differentiation control is the adenoviral E1A oncoprotein. E1A is expressed early in the viral replication cycle and interferes with the function of multiple cellular proteins involved in gene regulation. E1A can immortalize rodent fibroblasts and transforms them in collaboration with E1B or with activated versions of Ras (3Flint J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 177-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A comparison of E1A proteins from various viral serotypes highlights three conserved regions, CR1, CR2, and CR3, that bind to and modulate the activities of cellular proteins implicated in cell cycle progression (the retinoblastoma protein (Rb)), in chromatin remodeling (SWI·SNF complex, histone acetyltransferases) and in gene transcription (TFIID, mediator complex, transcription factors) (3Flint J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 177-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar,4Boyer T.G. Martin M.E. Lees E. Ricciardi R.P. Berk A.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). BS69 was originally identified as a nuclear protein that binds to E1A and inhibits its trans-activation potential (5Hateboer G. Gennissen A. Ramos Y.F. Kerkhoven R.M. Sonntag-Buck V. Stunnenberg H.G. Bernards R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3159-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). An alternatively spliced BS69 isoform, termed BRAM1, encompasses the C terminus of BS69. BRAM1, as well as its Caenorhabditis elegans orthologs, Bra-1 and Bra-2, were proposed to participate in BMP and TGFβ signaling pathways (6Morita K. Shimizu M. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6284-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Kurozumi K. Nishita M. Yamaguchi K. Fujita T. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The BS69 C terminus is related to a cysteine-rich structure that has been termed the Mynd domain. The Mynd domain is present in the AML1 chromosomal translocation partner ETO or in several developmentally important proteins, such as Nervy and DEAF1 (8Gross C.T. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The ETO-Mynd domain recruits a histone deacetylase complex and mediates gene repression (9Wang J. Hoshino T. Redner R.L. Kajigaya S. Liu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10860-10865Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 10Lutterbach B. Sun D. Schuetz J. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3604-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similarly, the BS69-Mynd domain has been suggested to be involved in repression through N-CoR recruitment (11Masselink H. Bernards R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we show that the BS69-specific Mynd domain shares structural and binding features with the two C. elegans proteins Bra-1 and Bra-2. BS69-type Mynd domains bind not only to E1A but also to the EBNA2 oncoprotein or to the Myc-related cellular transcription factor, MGA. Binding depends on a common PXLXP peptide motif found in all three proteins. Moreover, E1A competes for the interaction between BS69 and MGA. Our data suggest that the respective peptide motifs in oncoviral proteins have evolved to abrogate cellular functions of BS69-type Mynd domains. The competitive binding of cellular and viral proteins is reminiscent to the abrogation of functions of Rb-type proteins. BS69, E1A, and EBNA2 mutants were constructed by PCR and cloned in pcDNA3 or pGEX-4T1 vectors. DNA fragments encoding for Bra-1 (residues 82–183), Bra-2 (residues 108 to 214), RACK7 (residues 1007–1068), and ETO (residues 431 to 551) were obtained by PCR from EST (expressed sequence tag) clones and subcloned in pGEX-4T1. Notch1-IC and EBNA2 expression vectors, CBF1-, and Gal4-responsive reporters are described elsewhere (12Zimber-Strobl U. Kremmer E. Grasser F. Marschall G. Laux G. Bornkamm G.W.

Avian HD3 erythroblasts and QT6 fibroblasts were transfected as described (13Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Human HeLa cells were transfected with Exgen 500 reagent (Fermantas). CBF1 reporter assays were performed 24 h post-transfection using 2 μg of reporter, 0.005 μg of E1A, 0.2 μg of EBNA2, 0.2 μg each of Notch1-IC and of BS69 expression vectors. Gal4 reporter assays were performed 24 h post-transfection using 2 μg of reporter, 0.2 μg of Gal4DBD, 0.2 μg of Gal4-EBNA2, 0.05 μg of Gal4-VP16 expression vector, and 0.2 μg of BS69 expression vector. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, QT6 cells (106) were transfected with 3 μg of each expression vector and harvested 24 h post-transfection. HeLa cells (105) were transfected with 2 μg of each expression vector and harvested 48 h post-transfection. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (14Ansieau S. Strobl L.J. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors in experiments employing E1A and a BS69 C-terminal peptide. In experiments employing the full-length BS69 protein, cells were lysed in 350 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 30 mm MgCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40, sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, and diluted to a 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 8.5 mmMgCl2, and Nonidet P-40, 0.5% final concentration. Lysates were incubated with 6 μl of anti-BS69 ascites at 4 °C for 3 h. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed six times in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. BS69 and EBNA2 proteins were visualized with an M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Integra Bioscience) and an anti-EBNA2 monoclonal antibody, respectively (15Zimber-Strobl U. Strobl L.J. Meitinger C. Hinrichs R. Sakai T. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Bornkamm G.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4973-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screens were performed with the Matchmaker system (CLONTECH). A PCR fragment encoding amino acids 411-to 561 of human BS69 was generated and subcloned in-frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain in the pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH). The HF7c yeast strain (CLONTECH) was sequentially transformed with the bait and an Epstein-Barr viral human B-cell library or a human lung library (CLONTECH) and plated on selective plates. Colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity using a standard filter assay. To control the interaction specificity, plasmids were isolated and used to transform the SFY526 yeast strain (CLONTECH) in combination with the bait or unrelated Gal4 fusion proteins. A BS69-specific antibody was generated by expressing a peptide encompassing residues 358–441 of the human BS69 protein as a GST fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione beads. An antiserum against the peptide was raised in guinea pig. The human BS69 protein displays signatures of proteins that are involved in chromatin and gene regulation such as the PHD zinc-finger (16Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), bromo- (17Jeanmougin F. Wurtz J.M., Le Douarin B. Chambon P. Losson R. Trends Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and Mynd domains (8Gross C.T. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). The C-terminal third of BS69 corresponds to the splice variant BRAM1 and has been described as a target of E1A (5Hateboer G. Gennissen A. Ramos Y.F. Kerkhoven R.M. Sonntag-Buck V. Stunnenberg H.G. Bernards R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3159-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine the interaction between BS69 and E1A more precisely, we expressed BS69 deletion mutants as GST fusion proteins in bacteria (Fig. 1 A) and examined their interaction with in vitro translated 13S E1A. The BS69 Mynd domain was found to be required and sufficient for E1A binding (Fig.1 B). Mutation of a single conserved cysteine residue in the BS69 Mynd domain (Cys-532 to serine, Fig. 1 A) abrogated E1A binding (Fig. 1, B and C). BRAM1 orthologs have also been identified in C. elegans as Bra-1 and Bra-2, implicated in TGFβ/BMP signaling (6Morita K. Shimizu M. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6284-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Kurozumi K. Nishita M. Yamaguchi K. Fujita T. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Whereas the Mynd domains of Bra-1 and Bra-2 also bind to E1A, the Mynd domains of RACK7 (KIAA1125) and of ETO (9Wang J. Hoshino T. Redner R.L. Kajigaya S. Liu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10860-10865Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 10Lutterbach B. Sun D. Schuetz J. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3604-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), respectively, failed to do so (Fig. 1 E). These data suggest that BS69-type Mynd domains are specific and conserved targets of E1A. To identify additional proteins that interact with BS69-type Mynd domains, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens of an Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B-cell library using the BS69 Mynd domain as bait. Eight His+, β-Gal+ clones were isolated from 1 × 106 independent transformants. All eight clones encoded different C-terminal portions of the Epstein-Barr viral protein, EBNA2. Fig. 1 B shows that similar to E1A, binding of EBNA2 is restricted to and depends on the integrity of the BS69-Mynd domain. Fibroblasts were co-transfected with BS69 and EBNA2 expression vectors to examine whether EBNA2 also binds to BS69 in cells. As shown in Fig. 1 D, BS69 immunoprecipitates EBNA2. Similar to E1A, EBNA2 also binds to Bra-1 and Bra-2 but not to ETO or RACK7 (Fig. 1 E). Binding of two different oncoviral proteins to the BS69 Mynd domain prompted a search for a common target site. A series of oncoprotein mutants was generated and examined for interaction with the BS69 Mynd domain (Fig. 2). Amino acid (aa) residues 86–128 in E1A (Fig. 2 A) and two independent protein parts in EBNA2 (aa 379–408 and 409–439, Fig. 2 B) were identified. A comparison of the corresponding amino acid sequences revealed a common pentamer peptide motif, PXLXP (Fig. 2 C). To determine whether this motif is involved in binding to BS69, the central invariable leucine residue was mutated into an alanine in E1A. As shown in Fig.3 A, the resulting 12S and 13S E1A (E1A,L115A) mutant proteins failed to interact with BS69. Similarly, EBNA2, mutated within both of the PXLXP motifs (EBNA2 L385A,L439A), failed to interact with BS69 (Fig. 3 B). Mutation of a single motif in EBNA2 (EBNA2 L385A and EBNA2 L439A), however, did not abrogate BS69 binding, suggesting the redundancy of EBNA2 PXLXP motifs (data not shown). These data suggest that both oncoviral proteins interact specifically with the BS69 specific Mynd domain via a common structural motif.Figure 3The BS69 Mynd domain targets a PXLXP peptide present in E1A, EBNA2, and MGA. A, disruption of the PXLXP motif in E1A abrogates binding to BS69. QT6 fibroblasts were transfected with various E1A and/or FLAG-tagged BS69 (residues 411–561) cDNA expression vectors, as indicated. Cellular protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with an anti-E1A monoclonal antibody. Co-immunoprecipitated (Co-IP) and ectopic expression of BS69 were revealed by immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG M2 antibody.B, disruption of both PXLXP motifs in EBNA2 abrogates binding to BS69. In vitro radiolabeled EBNA2 proteins were incubated with total cellular extracts from mock-transfected (−) or from HeLa fibroblasts transfected with a FLAG-tagged BS69 C-terminal peptide (residues 411–561). Cellular protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. Co-immunoprecipitated EBNA2 and BS69 were revealed by autoradiography and by immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody, respectively. C, deletion of both PXLXP motifs in MGA abrogates binding to BS69.

Input, 10%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We searched for cellular proteins that interact with the BS69 Mynd domain in a lung library using the yeast two-hybrid assay. From one million transformants two His+, β-Gal+ clones displayed very fast staining kinetics and were therefore examined further. Sequence analysis revealed that both clones were identical and encompassed amino acid residues 2566–2975 of the Myc-related protein MGA (19Hurlin P.J. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that PXLXP motifs are present in duplicate in the MGA C terminus (Fig.2 C). Deletion analysis, as shown in Fig. 3C, confirmed that the PXLXP motifs in MGA are essential for binding to the BS69 Mynd domain. Next we determined whether E1A proteins compete for the interaction between BS69 and MGA. A GST-BS69 protein construct was preincubated with total cellular extracts of mock-transfected or E1A-transfected QT6 fibroblasts and tested for its ability to pull down radiolabeled MGA protein. As shown in Fig. 3 D, binding of either 12S E1A or 13S E1A proteins to BS69 abrogated the binding of MGA, whereas E1A mutants that fail to bind to BS69 (12 S E1A L115A and 13 S E1A L115A) do not compete for BS69-MGA interaction. E1A has previously been shown to neutralize the repressing function of BS69 (11Masselink H. Bernards R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Repressor activity of BS69 can be determined in an assay in which reporter expression is driven by the oncoviral protein (5Hateboer G. Gennissen A. Ramos Y.F. Kerkhoven R.M. Sonntag-Buck V. Stunnenberg H.G. Bernards R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3159-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To examine whether E1A and EBNA2 similarly affect BS69 function, we took advantage of the fact that both oncoviral proteins activate reporter gene expression through the CBF1/RPB-Jκ transcription factor (14Ansieau S. Strobl L.J. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Zimber-Strobl U. Strobl L.J. Meitinger C. Hinrichs R. Sakai T. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Bornkamm G.W.

A. 1994; 91: 7568-7572Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), a downstream target of Notch signaling (23Egan S.E., St.- Pierre B. Leow C.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 273-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4949) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, expression of BS69 strongly reduces reporter activation through E1A or EBNA2 but did not affect reporter activation through the active form of Notch1 (23Egan S.E., St.- Pierre B. Leow C.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 273-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4949) Google Scholar). Furthermore, E1A or EBNA2 mutants that failed to bind BS69 were also not suppressed by BS69. To validate the inhibitory effect of BS69 on EBNA2 trans-activation, EBNA2 was fused to the DNA binding domain of the Gal4 transcription factor (Gal-), and the activity of the resulting fusion protein (Gal-EBNA2) was examined on an appropriate reporter. As shown in Fig. 4 B, BS69 expression strongly reduces reporter activation of the Gal-EBNA2 fusion protein yet not of a Gal-VP16 control. These data show that specific interaction between BS69 and its target proteins is a prerequisite for BS69-mediated gene repression. The results also suggest that the inhibitory function of BS69 is specifically neutralized by E1A and EBNA2. BS69 mediates transcriptional inhibition and represents a potential tumor suppressor protein (11Masselink H. Bernards R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For gene repression, BS69 essentially requires the function of its C-terminal Mynd domain (5Hateboer G. Gennissen A. Ramos Y.F. Kerkhoven R.M. Sonntag-Buck V. Stunnenberg H.G. Bernards R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3159-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,11Masselink H. Bernards R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which also represents a conserved target of different viral oncoproteins. We found that BS69-type Mynd domains interact through conserved PXLXP peptide motifs with the oncoviral proteins E1A and EBNA2 and with the cellular MGA protein. MGA is a member of the Myc-Max network of bHLH-ZIP transcription factors that contains a T-box domain and presumably links cell proliferation control to mesoderm specification during embryogenesis (19Hurlin P.J. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our data also show that E1A competes the interaction between BS69 and MGA. Whereas the C. elegans Bra-1 and Bra-2 Mynd domains shared the same binding specificities as BS69, the related Mynd domains of RACK7 and ETO proteins failed to do so, suggesting that various types of Mynd domains mediate highly specific protein interactions. Comparison of the BS69, RACK7, and ETO Mynd domains revealed differences in amino acids and cysteine spacing that might account for distinct protein interactions (Fig. 1 A). In agreement with this notion is the observation that the interaction between E1A or EBNA2 with BS69 is abrogated by a point mutation of a single cysteine residue (C523S) in the Mynd domain. PXLXP motifs were identified as essential components of the BS69 Mynd targets. The first PXLXP target was found in E1A between conserved regions CR1 and CR2 (Figs. 2 A and 3 A). Others have suggested that a BS69 interaction site is located between CR1 and CR2 of E1A in addition to binding to CR3 (5Hateboer G. Gennissen A. Ramos Y.F. Kerkhoven R.M. Sonntag-Buck V. Stunnenberg H.G. Bernards R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3159-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In our hands, however, CR3 contributed poorly to BS69 binding. This conclusion is based on the observations that comparable BS69 immunoprecipitation was obtained with 12S and 13S E1A (Fig. 3 A) and that weak residual binding of the PXLXP mutant 13S E1A L115A was only observed under low stringency binding conditions (data not shown). Moreover, two PXLXP motifs in EBNA2, located in regions CR7 and CR8, were also identified as critical for BS69 binding (Figs. 2 B and 3 B). Mutations of the PxLxP motifs in either E1A or EBNA2, however, did not inhibit binding to and trans-activation through CBF1 (Fig. 4and data not shown). Furthermore, E1A PXLXP mutants specifically disrupted the interaction with BS69 without affecting the ability of E1A to associate with Rb (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that PXLXP motifs are indispensable for BS69-type Mynd domain interactions. Conservation of PXLXP motifs in various viral serotypes suggests that the motifs mediate important oncoprotein functions. This notion is supported by the fact that others have shown that deletions covering CR7 or CR8 in EBNA2 and deletion of sequences comprising the BS69 binding sites in E1A abrogate the transformation potential of the respective oncoproteins (25Cohen J.I. Wang F. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bautista D.S. Hitt M. McGrory J. Graham F.L. Virology. 1991; 182: 578-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A question that emerges is whether the PXLXP sequence would be sufficient for BS69 interaction. Data base searches identified many proteins that contain PXLXP motifs. One of them is the human TATA-box-binding protein, TBP, that contains PXLXP at its C terminus. TBP, however, failed to bind to BS69 (data not shown). This suggests that additional structural constraints are required for specific BS69 Mynd domain/PXLXP interaction that await further analysis. Nevertheless, we believe that the remarkable conservation of protein sequence and interaction specificity across species is intriguing and will help to elucidate Mynd functions in development and tumorigenesis. Data presented here also include identification of MGA as a cellular binding partner for BS69. E1A competed with MGA for BS69 binding, and the interaction of MGA with BS69 depended on PXLXP motifs in the C terminus of MGA. The competitive interaction between BS69 and a critical cellular protein with two entirely different viral oncoproteins via identical protein motifs is reminiscent of the interaction between cellular pocket-binding proteins of the Rb family with several DNA tumor-viral oncoproteins through LxCxE motifs (27Zalvide J. Stubdal H. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1408-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P.

In keeping with that idea, it has been speculated that BS69 is a tumor suppressor that is frequently deleted in cancers and leukemia and that inhibits transcription through proto-oncogene products (11Masselink H. Bernards R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is also the genetic connection between the TGFβ/BMP pathways and Bra-1/Bra-2 (6Morita K. Shimizu M. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6284-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Kurozumi K. Nishita M. Yamaguchi K. Fujita T. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our data show that theC. elegans Bra-1/Bra-2 Mynd domains display the same binding specificity as BS69. Because Bra-1 has been implicated in TGFβ signaling, it will be interesting to investigate whether E1A and EBNA2 might disrupt TFGβ signaling and alter cell proliferation and differentiation through abrogating functions of BS69-type Mynd domains. We thank Dr. Elisabeth Kremmer for providing the monoclonal anti-EBNA2 antibody, Dr. Lothar J. Strobl for providing the EBNA2 expression vector and some deletion derivatives, and members of the laboratory of A. Leutz for discussion."

The agr system is widely divergent and is unique in that variant AIPs cross-inhibitagr activation in heterologous combinations. Cross-inhibition, but not self-activation, is widely tolerant of structural diversity in the AIPs so that these two processes must involve different mechanisms of interaction with the respective receptors. Herein, we have utilized this naturally occurring antagonism to demonstrate that both activation and inhibition are reversible and that activators and inhibitors interact at a common site on the receptor.

Taniguchi M. Sugiyama T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In bacteria, RHKs are involved in sensing the environmental surroundings. Many of these kinases contain two transmembrane helices flanking a periplasmic domain. This domain contains the binding site for the appropriate ligand, such as metal ions (Mg2+ in the case of PhoP) (2Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Many RHKs have been shown to exist as preformed dimers in the inner cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (3Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). In the case of EnvZ, a pair of cytoplasmic α-helices from each monomer form a four-helix bundle (4Tomomori C. Tanaka T. Dutta R. Park H. Saha S.K. Zhu Y. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kurokawa H. Qian H. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In Gram-positive bacteria, pheromone-inducible RHKs usually have a polytopic sensor domain, containing 5–8 membrane-spanning segments. RHKs predicted to possess this polytopic sensor domain include AgrC from Staphylococcus aureus (5Lina G. Jarraud S., Ji, G. Greenland T. Pedraza A. Etienne J. Novick R.P. Vandenesch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), ComD from Streptococcus pneumoniae (6Havarstein L.S. Gaustad P. Nes I.F. Morrison D.A. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These RHKs respond to secreted signaling peptides, which bind to the sensor domain to initiate the transmembrane signal that activates the intracellular histidine kinase (HK). Notably, there is at least one RHK in Escherichia coli, UhpB, which contains 6–8 transmembrane helices and which is also thought to function as a homodimeric complex (9Wright III, J.S. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3149-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The agr system in S. aureus is the most fully characterized in terms of the receptor-ligand interaction. Density-dependent accumulation of an extracellular peptide, known as the AIP and derived from processing of the prepeptide, AgrD, triggers activation of the receptor-histidine kinase, AgrC. This leads to a downstream virulence response via the unique regulator, RNAIII (10Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). This signaling process is one example of density-dependent or “quorum-sensing” systems widespread in bacteria (11Schauder S.

The sequence of the AIPs is highly variable, resulting in at least four specificity groups within S. aureus and many others in other staphylococcal species (13Otto M. Sussmuth R. Jung G. Gotz F.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6517-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). All strains within a group produce the same AIP. The agrB, -D, and -C region varies in concert so as to maintain the specificity of AIP processing and function (15Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Remarkably, each AIP has two biological functions; it can activate the virulence response within its own specificity group and inhibit the virulence response in other groups (15Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). This is a form of bacterial competition that does not result in growth inhibition but rather in virulence attenuation, presumably resulting in an advantage for the strain producing the most abundant and/or most potent AIP. Note that in lactobacilli, pneumococci, and bacilli, although there are many natural signaling peptide variants, in no case has cross-inhibition been reported. Thus, agr is the only bacterial two-component system in which natural antagonists have been identified so far.Extensive structure-activity relationship studies have been performed on the AIPs (16Mayville P., Ji, G. Beavis R. Yang H. Goger M. Novick R.P. Muir T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 17Otto M. Sussmuth R. Vuong C. Jung G. Gotz F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and have shown that (i) the AIPs contain a thiolactone structure that is absolutely required for potent biological activity; (ii) this linkage is formed from the condensation of the α-carboxyl group of the peptide with the sulfhydryl group of a conserved cysteine, which is always the fifth amino acid from the C terminus (see Fig. 1); (iii) the lactam and lactone analogs of AIP-II are potent agr cross-group inhibitors but lack activity against self, at concentrations up to 5 μm (16Mayville P., Ji, G. Beavis R. Yang H. Goger M. Novick R.P. Muir T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar); (iv) the N-terminal four amino acids of the group II AIP, collectively referred to as the “tail region,” are necessary for self-activation but not for cross-group inhibition (16Mayville P., Ji, G. Beavis R. Yang H. Goger M. Novick R.P. Muir T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar); and (v) a truncated version of AIP-II, lacking the tail region but retaining the thioester bond (see Fig. 1), is a global agrinhibitor (18Lyon G.J. Mayville P. Muir T.W. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13330-13335Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this report, the AIPs are identified as AIP-X, where X represents the specificity group from which the AIP is derived. For example, the group I AIP is referred to as AIP-I, and the truncated group II AIP is referred to as trAIP-II.It has been demonstrated that the N-terminal region of AgrC, the sensor domain, contains the agonist AIP binding site (5Lina G. Jarraud S., Ji, G. Greenland T. Pedraza A. Etienne J. Novick R.P. Vandenesch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Sequence and PhoA fusion analyses suggest that the sensor domain is composed of five or six transmembrane helices, depending on whether the N terminus of the protein is placed on the inside or outside of the cell (5Lina G. Jarraud S., Ji, G. Greenland T. Pedraza A. Etienne J. Novick R.P. Vandenesch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that AgrC and the AIP are the only group-specific components of the system that are required foragr activation and inhibition (18Lyon G.J. Mayville P. Muir T.W. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13330-13335Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated unequivocally that the sensor domain of AgrC confers group-specific activation and inhibition by the AIPs, and we have begun to investigate ligand binding with special reference to the mechanism of antagonism. We have previously speculated that the acylating nature of the thioester bond might play some role in activation of the receptor (16Mayville P., Ji, G. Beavis R. Yang H. Goger M. Novick R.P. Muir T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In this report, it is shown that the AIP-receptor interaction is reversible, ruling out a stable covalent bond between ligand and receptor. Agonists and antagonists most likely interact via a common site at the sensor domain of AgrC.DISCUSSIONThe agr signaling system in S. aureusis thus far unique in bacterial cell-cell signaling in that there are naturally occurring antagonists of the cell surface receptor, AgrC. The uniqueness of natural cross-inhibition by a bacterial autoinducer has prompted in depth studies of the agr ligand-receptor interaction and its inhibition. In the present study, our primary focus was on the reversibility (or irreversibility) of the agrAIP-receptor interaction. The theoretical basis for this focus was the possibility that the AIPs, with their highly reactive thiolactone bond, unique for signaling peptides, might act by acylating their receptor, leading to irreversible activation. This was supported by preliminary experiments in which it was not possible to eliminate AIP-induced signaling completely by extensive washing. However, a definitive test for reversibility was enabled by the natural antagonism among variant AIPs produced by strains belonging to different agrspecificity groups. In these experiments, we used primarily theagr group I and II AIPs and their synthetic analogsversus test strains belonging to either group. Using several different experimental protocols, we have shown clearly that all of the AIP-receptor interactions that we have been able to test are completely reversed by an antagonist AIP. Thus, the residual activity remaining after extensive washing was eliminated by treatment of the cells with an antagonist, and only the relative concentrations of agonist and antagonist and not the order of their addition determined the outcome of an experiment. An extracellular site of action for the AIPs is supported by the chimeric receptor data (Fig. 2) as well as by the washout data (Fig. 3). Although these data and the results with the lactam analog rule out a stable covalent linkage between the AIPs and the receptor, we cannot formally rule out a transient covalent linkage formed between the AIP and receptor.The lactam analogs of AIP-I (23McDowell P. Affas Z. Reynolds C. Holden M.T.G. Wood S.J. Saint S. Cockayne A. Hill P.J. Dodd C.E.R. Bycroft B.W. Chan W.C. Williams P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and AIP-II can activate their cognate receptors, but only at very high concentrations. Our finding that this activation is competitively blocked by a native heterologous AIP suggests that the lactam analog binds its cognate receptor on the same site as the native thiolactone, but only very weakly. Nonetheless, this does suggest that the highly reactive thiolactone linkage is not absolutely required for activation of the receptor. Furthermore, cross-inhibition by the AIP-II lactam analog is similar in potency to cross-inhibition by the native AIP-II, suggesting that the lactam binds the heterologous receptor with similar affinity as the native peptide. Thus, the cross-inhibitory action of the AIPs involves a binding interaction with the heterologous receptor that is very different from binding to the cognate receptor. The agonist and antagonist AIPs most likely bind in slightly different orientations to the same general region of the receptor such that the thioester group makes critical contacts with the receptor in one orientation (i.e. where the AIP and AgrC belong to the same group) but not in the other. This cross-inhibitory binding is also very permissive with respect to the AIP amino acid sequence, since many variant AIPs so far tested are strong antagonists although their sequences are highly divergent (13Otto M. Sussmuth R. Jung G. Gotz F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Jarraud S. Lyon G.J. Figueiredo A.M. Gerard L. Vandenesch F. Etienne J. Muir T.W. Novick R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6517-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar).Pharmacological experiments were performed in which agonist concentration-response curves were measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of antagonist AIP. In all cases examined, the agonist and antagonist curves shifted in a parallel, dextral fashion with no depression of the agonist maximal response (Fig. 4,A and B). Qualitatively, these observations are consistent with a simple competitive interaction in which the agonist and antagonist AIPs compete for the same binding site on the receptor, AgrC. The data sets were also analyzed using the nonlinear regression method of Lew and Angus (21Lew M.J. Angus J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 328-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As summarized in Table I, the calculated Schild slopes were all considerably less than unity. Surprisingly, this does not conform to a simple 1:1 competitive interaction, which predicts a Schild slope of 1. It should be noted, however, that because the assays in the current study quantified downstream transcriptional effects, mechanistic interpretations of the Schild slope factors and pA2 values remain speculative until future (direct binding) experiments can determine such values more directly. This caveat aside, the results do raise the possibility that the receptor-ligand interaction occurs through some more subtle mechanism. In this regard, it is worth noting that bacterial RHKs are generally thought to be dimeric (3Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar), raising at least the possibility of cooperativity between two AIP binding sites. Although this is an intriguing idea, additional experiments will be required to test this hypothesis.The overall conclusions from these studies are (i) the N-terminal sensor domain of AgrC determines receptor specificity and contains the binding site for agonist and antagonist AIPs; (ii) AIPs bind a heterologous AgrC differently than the cognate receptor (the latter but not the former is profoundly affected by the substitution of a lactam for the native thiolactone); (iii) certain modifications of the AIP generate a self-inhibitory peptide that is assumed to bind the same way as the native cognate AIP; (iv) agonist-antagonist interactions are reversible and probably competitive in that they involve overlapping binding sites; and (v) the key residue in the AIP-II tail region is the asparagine at position 4. Further structure-activity relationship studies of this position will illustrate the difference between self-activation and self-inhibition. In contrast, the endocyclic aspartate adjacent to the cysteine in AIP-I has been shown to be the key residue in terms of self-activation versusself-inhibition (23McDowell P. Affas Z. Reynolds C. Holden M.T.G. Wood S.J. Saint S. Cockayne A. Hill P.J. Dodd C.E.R. Bycroft B.W. Chan W.C. Williams P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the fact that AIP-I and AIP-IV differ only by one amino acid, an aspartate versus a tyrosine at this same position (14Jarraud S. Lyon G.J. Figueiredo A.M. Gerard L. Vandenesch F. Etienne J. Muir T.W. Novick R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6517-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).S. aureus is an important nosocomial pathogen that has developed resistance to most antibiotics and has lately become the focus of novel therapeutic initiatives. The data described herein have demonstrated that the mechanism of interference proceeds through reversible and specific extracellular antagonism of signaling through the sensor domain of AgrC. Given that there are many RHK-based systems in bacteria, plants, and other species, the design of molecules that compete with naturally occurring agonists for binding at RHK sensor domains could represent a generally applicable approach to the inhibition of RHK signaling.

Taniguchi M. Sugiyama T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In bacteria, RHKs are involved in sensing the environmental surroundings. Many of these kinases contain two transmembrane helices flanking a periplasmic domain. This domain contains the binding site for the appropriate ligand, such as metal ions (Mg2+ in the case of PhoP) (2Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Many RHKs have been shown to exist as preformed dimers in the inner cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (3Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). In the case of EnvZ, a pair of cytoplasmic α-helices from each monomer form a four-helix bundle (4Tomomori C. Tanaka T. Dutta R. Park H. Saha S.K. Zhu Y. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kurokawa H. Qian H. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In Gram-positive bacteria, pheromone-inducible RHKs usually have a polytopic sensor domain, containing 5–8 membrane-spanning segments. RHKs predicted to possess this polytopic sensor domain include AgrC from Staphylococcus aureus (5Lina G. Jarraud S., Ji, G. Greenland T. Pedraza A. Etienne J. Novick R.P. Vandenesch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), ComD from Streptococcus pneumoniae (6Havarstein L.S. Gaustad P. Nes I.F. Morrison D.A. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These RHKs respond to secreted signaling peptides, which bind to the sensor domain to initiate the transmembrane signal that activates the intracellular histidine kinase (HK). Notably, there is at least one RHK in Escherichia coli, UhpB, which contains 6–8 transmembrane helices and which is also thought to function as a homodimeric complex (9Wright III, J.S. Kadner R.J. J.

Density-dependent accumulation of an extracellular peptide, known as the AIP and derived from processing of the prepeptide, AgrD, triggers activation of the receptor-histidine kinase, AgrC. This leads to a downstream virulence response via the unique regulator, RNAIII (10Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). This signaling process is one example of density-dependent or “quorum-sensing” systems widespread in bacteria (11Schauder S. Bassler B.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1468-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 12Winzer K. Williams P. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 291: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The sequence of the AIPs is highly variable, resulting in at least four specificity groups within S. aureus and many others in other staphylococcal species (13Otto M. Sussmuth R. Jung G. Gotz F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Jarraud S. Lyon G.J. Figueiredo A.M. Gerard L. Vandenesch F. Etienne J. Muir T.W. Novick R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6517-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). All strains within a group produce the same AIP. The agrB, -D, and -C region varies in concert so as to maintain the specificity of AIP processing and function (15Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Remarkably, each AIP has two biological functions; it can activate the virulence response within its own specificity group and inhibit the virulence response in other groups (15Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). This is a form of bacterial competition that does not result in growth inhibition but rather in virulence attenuation, presumably resulting in an advantage for the strain producing the most abundant and/or most potent AIP. Note that in lactobacilli, pneumococci, and bacilli, although there are many natural signaling peptide variants, in no case has cross-inhibition been reported. Thus, agr is the only bacterial two-component system in which natural antagonists have been identified so far. Extensive structure-activity relationship studies have been performed on the AIPs (16Mayville P., Ji, G. Beavis R. Yang H. Goger M. Novick R.P. Muir T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 17Otto M. Sussmuth R. Vuong C. Jung G. Gotz F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and have shown that (i) the AIPs contain a thiolactone structure that is absolutely required for potent biological activity; (ii) this linkage is formed from the condensation of the α-carboxyl group of the peptide with the sulfhydryl group of a conserved cysteine, which is always the fifth amino acid from the C terminus (see Fig. 1); (iii) the lactam and lactone analogs of AIP-II are potent agr cross-group inhibitors but lack activity against self, at concentrations up to 5 μm (16Mayville P., Ji, G. Beavis R. Yang H. Goger M. Novick R.P. Muir T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar); (iv) the N-terminal four amino acids of the group II AIP, collectively referred to as the “tail region,” are necessary for self-activation but not for cross-group inhibition (16Mayville P., Ji, G. Beavis R. Yang H. Goger M. Novick R.P. Muir T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar); and (v) a truncated version of AIP-II, lacking the tail region but retaining the thioester bond (see Fig. 1), is a global agrinhibitor (18Lyon G.J. Mayville P. Muir T.W. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13330-13335Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this report, the AIPs are identified as AIP-X, where X represents the specificity group from which the AIP is derived. For example, the group I AIP is referred to as AIP-I, and the truncated group II AIP is referred to as trAIP-II. It has been demonstrated that the N-terminal region of AgrC, the sensor domain, contains the agonist AIP binding site (5Lina G. Jarraud S., Ji, G. Greenland T. Pedraza A. Etienne J. Novick R.P. Vandenesch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Sequence and PhoA fusion analyses suggest that the sensor domain is composed of five or six transmembrane helices, depending on whether the N terminus of the protein is placed on the inside or outside of the cell (5Lina G. Jarraud S., Ji, G. Greenland T. Pedraza A. Etienne J. Novick R.P. Vandenesch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that AgrC and the AIP are the only group-specific components of the system that are required foragr activation and inhibition (18Lyon G.J. Mayville P. Muir T.W. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13330-13335Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated unequivocally that the sensor domain of AgrC confers group-specific activation and inhibition by the AIPs, and we have begun to investigate ligand binding with special reference to the mechanism of antagonism. We have previously speculated that the acylating nature of the thioester bond might play some role in activation of the receptor (16Mayville P., Ji, G. Beavis R. Yang H. Goger M. Novick R.P. Muir T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In this report, it is shown that the AIP-receptor interaction is reversible, ruling out a stable covalent bond between ligand and receptor. Agonists and antagonists most likely interact via a common site at the sensor domain of AgrC. DISCUSSIONThe agr signaling system in S. aureusis thus far unique in bacterial cell-cell signaling in that there are naturally occurring antagonists of the cell surface receptor, AgrC. The uniqueness of natural cross-inhibition by a bacterial autoinducer has prompted in depth studies of the agr ligand-receptor interaction and its inhibition. In the present study, our primary focus was on the reversibility (or irreversibility) of the agrAIP-receptor interaction. The theoretical basis for this focus was the possibility that the AIPs, with their highly reactive thiolactone bond, unique for signaling peptides, might act by acylating their receptor, leading to irreversible activation. This was supported by preliminary experiments in which it was not possible to eliminate AIP-induced signaling completely by extensive washing. However, a definitive test for reversibility was enabled by the natural antagonism among variant AIPs produced by strains belonging to different agrspecificity groups. In these experiments, we used primarily theagr group I and II AIPs and their synthetic analogsversus test strains belonging to either group. Using several different experimental protocols, we have shown clearly that all of the AIP-receptor interactions that we have been able to test are completely reversed by an antagonist AIP. Thus, the residual activity remaining after extensive washing was eliminated by treatment of the cells with an antagonist, and only the relative concentrations of agonist and antagonist and not the order of their addition determined the outcome of an experiment. An extracellular site of action for the AIPs is supported by the chimeric receptor data (Fig. 2) as well as by the washout data (Fig. 3). Although these data and the results with the lactam analog rule out a stable covalent linkage between the AIPs and the receptor, we cannot formally rule out a transient covalent linkage formed between the AIP and receptor.The lactam analogs of AIP-I (23McDowell P. Affas Z. Reynolds C. Holden M.T.G. Wood S.J. Saint S. Cockayne A. Hill P.J. Dodd C.E.R. Bycroft B.W. Chan W.C. Williams P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and AIP-II can activate their cognate receptors, but only at very high concentrations. Our finding that this activation is competitively blocked by a native heterologous AIP suggests that the lactam analog binds its cognate receptor on the same site as the native thiolactone, but only very weakly. Nonetheless, this does suggest that the highly reactive thiolactone linkage is not absolutely required for activation of the receptor. Furthermore, cross-inhibition by the AIP-II lactam analog is similar in potency to cross-inhibition by the native AIP-II, suggesting that the lactam binds the heterologous receptor with similar affinity as the native peptide. Thus, the cross-inhibitory action of the AIPs involves a binding interaction with the heterologous receptor that is very different from binding to the cognate receptor. The agonist and antagonist AIPs most likely bind in slightly different orientations to the same general region of the receptor such that the thioester group makes critical contacts with the receptor in one orientation (i.e. where the AIP and AgrC belong to the same group) but not in the other. This cross-inhibitory binding is also very permissive with respect to the AIP amino acid sequence, since many variant AIPs so far tested are strong antagonists although their sequences are highly divergent (13Otto M. Sussmuth R. Jung G. Gotz F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Jarraud S. Lyon G.J. Figueiredo A.M. Gerard L. Vandenesch F. Etienne J. Muir T.W. Novick R.P. J.

In all cases examined, the agonist and antagonist curves shifted in a parallel, dextral fashion with no depression of the agonist maximal response (Fig. 4,A and B). Qualitatively, these observations are consistent with a simple competitive interaction in which the agonist and antagonist AIPs compete for the same binding site on the receptor, AgrC. The data sets were also analyzed using the nonlinear regression method of Lew and Angus (21Lew M.J. Angus J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 328-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As summarized in Table I, the calculated Schild slopes were all considerably less than unity. Surprisingly, this does not conform to a simple 1:1 competitive interaction, which predicts a Schild slope of 1. It should be noted, however, that because the assays in the current study quantified downstream transcriptional effects, mechanistic interpretations of the Schild slope factors and pA2 values remain speculative until future (direct binding) experiments can determine such values more directly. This caveat aside, the results do raise the possibility that the receptor-ligand interaction occurs through some more subtle mechanism. In this regard, it is worth noting that bacterial RHKs are generally thought to be dimeric (3Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev.

This is consistent with the fact that AIP-I and AIP-IV differ only by one amino acid, an aspartate versus a tyrosine at this same position (14Jarraud S. Lyon G.J. Figueiredo A.M. Gerard L.

The data described herein have demonstrated that the mechanism of interference proceeds through reversible and specific extracellular antagonism of signaling through the sensor domain of AgrC. Given that there are many RHK-based systems in bacteria, plants, and other species, the design of molecules that compete with naturally occurring agonists for binding at RHK sensor domains could represent a generally applicable approach to the inhibition of RHK signaling. The agr signaling system in S. aureusis thus far unique in bacterial cell-cell signaling in that there are naturally occurring antagonists of the cell surface receptor, AgrC. The uniqueness of natural cross-inhibition by a bacterial autoinducer has prompted in depth studies of the agr ligand-receptor interaction and its inhibition. In the present study, our primary focus was on the reversibility (or irreversibility) of the agrAIP-receptor interaction. The theoretical basis for this focus was the possibility that the AIPs, with their highly reactive thiolactone bond, unique for signaling peptides, might act by acylating their receptor, leading to irreversible activation. This was supported by preliminary experiments in which it was not possible to eliminate AIP-induced signaling completely by extensive washing. However, a definitive test for reversibility was enabled by the natural antagonism among variant AIPs produced by strains belonging to different agrspecificity groups. In these experiments, we used primarily theagr group I and II AIPs and their synthetic analogsversus test strains belonging to either group. Using several different experimental protocols, we have shown clearly that all of the AIP-receptor interactions that we have been able to test are completely reversed by an antagonist AIP. Thus, the residual activity remaining after extensive washing was eliminated by treatment of the cells with an antagonist, and only the relative concentrations of agonist and antagonist and not the order of their addition determined the outcome of an experiment. An extracellular site of action for the AIPs is supported by the chimeric receptor data (Fig. 2) as well as by the washout data (Fig. 3). Although these data and the results with the lactam analog rule out a stable covalent linkage between the AIPs and the receptor, we cannot formally rule out a transient covalent linkage formed between the AIP and receptor. The lactam analogs of AIP-I (23McDowell P. Affas Z. Reynolds C. Holden M.T.G. Wood S.J. Saint S. Cockayne A. Hill P.J. Dodd C.E.R. Bycroft B.W. Chan W.C. Williams P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and AIP-II can activate their cognate receptors, but only at very high concentrations. Our finding that this activation is competitively blocked by a native heterologous AIP suggests that the lactam analog binds its cognate receptor on the same site as the native thiolactone, but only very weakly. Nonetheless, this does suggest that the highly reactive thiolactone linkage is not absolutely required for activation of the receptor. Furthermore, cross-inhibition by the AIP-II lactam analog is similar in potency to cross-inhibition by the native AIP-II, suggesting that the lactam binds the heterologous receptor with similar affinity as the native peptide. Thus, the cross-inhibitory action of the AIPs involves a binding interaction with the heterologous receptor that is very different from binding to the cognate receptor. The agonist and antagonist AIPs most likely bind in slightly different orientations to the same general region of the receptor such that the thioester group makes critical contacts with the receptor in one orientation (i.e. where the AIP and AgrC belong to the same group) but not in the other. This cross-inhibitory binding is also very permissive with respect to the AIP amino acid sequence, since many variant AIPs so far tested are strong antagonists although their sequences are highly divergent (13Otto M. Sussmuth R. Jung G. Gotz F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Jarraud S. Lyon G.J. Figueiredo A.M. Gerard L. Vandenesch F. Etienne J. Muir T.W. Novick R.P. J.

Pharmacological experiments were performed in which agonist concentration-response curves were measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of antagonist AIP. In all cases examined, the agonist and antagonist curves shifted in a parallel, dextral fashion with no depression of the agonist maximal response (Fig. 4,A and B). Qualitatively, these observations are consistent with a simple competitive interaction in which the agonist and antagonist AIPs compete for the same binding site on the receptor, AgrC. The data sets were also analyzed using the nonlinear regression method of Lew and Angus (21Lew M.J. Angus J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 328-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As summarized in Table I, the calculated Schild slopes were all considerably less than unity. Surprisingly, this does not conform to a simple 1:1 competitive interaction, which predicts a Schild slope of 1. It should be noted, however, that because the assays in the current study quantified downstream transcriptional effects, mechanistic interpretations of the Schild slope factors and pA2 values remain speculative until future (direct binding) experiments can determine such values more directly. This caveat aside, the results do raise the possibility that the receptor-ligand interaction occurs through some more subtle mechanism. In this regard, it is worth noting that bacterial RHKs are generally thought to be dimeric (3Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar), raising at least the possibility of cooperativity between two AIP binding sites. Although this is an intriguing idea, additional experiments will be required to test this hypothesis. The overall conclusions from these studies are (i) the N-terminal sensor domain of AgrC determines receptor specificity and contains the binding site for agonist and antagonist AIPs; (ii) AIPs bind a heterologous AgrC differently than the cognate receptor (the latter but not the former is profoundly affected by the substitution of a lactam for the native thiolactone); (iii) certain modifications of the AIP generate a self-inhibitory peptide that is assumed to bind the same way as the native cognate AIP; (iv) agonist-antagonist interactions are reversible and probably competitive in that they involve overlapping binding sites; and (v) the key residue in the AIP-II tail region is the asparagine at position 4. Further structure-activity relationship studies of this position will illustrate the difference between self-activation and self-inhibition. In contrast, the endocyclic aspartate adjacent to the cysteine in AIP-I has been shown to be the key residue in terms of self-activation versusself-inhibition (23McDowell P. Affas Z. Reynolds C. Holden M.T.G. Wood S.J. Saint S. Cockayne A. Hill P.J. Dodd C.E.R. Bycroft B.W. Chan W.C. Williams P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the fact that AIP-I and AIP-IV differ only by one amino acid, an aspartate versus a tyrosine at this same position (14Jarraud S. Lyon G.J. Figueiredo A.M. Gerard L. Vandenesch F. Etienne J. Muir T.W. Novick R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6517-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).

There is a significant body of evidence that suggests that this protein plays a central role in adipocytic and eosinophilic differentiation. However, there is no information available regarding the role of this transcription factor in the development of mammalian neuronal tissues. In this study, we have examined the effect of C/EBPβ overexpression on the differentiation and survival of mouse Neuro2A cells. We found that C/EBPβ induces neuronal differentiation and that this process is inhibited by transfection with the C/EBP homologous protein 10 (CHOP), strongly suggesting that the extension of neurites is indeed due to the C/EBPβ transcriptional activity. As it has been suggested in adipocyte differentiation, here we show that C/EBPβ induces the expression of the endogenous C/EBPα gene and that this protein by itself is also able to induce a differentiated phenotype in Neuro2A cells. Neuronal differentiation induced by C/EBPβ requires activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway, whereas inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling does not have any effect. In addition, we show that C/EBPβ is expressed in the brain of neonatal rats, suggesting that this protein could play an important role in neuronal maturation.

Neuritogenesis is a central event in brain development, and its regulation during neuronal differentiation is complex and likely to involve multiple signaling systems and the regulation of a wide set of genes. Research over the past few years has given us a glimpse of the molecules involved in dendritic morphogenesis. Proper dendrite development relies on extracellular signals and the signal transduction that lies downstream of them (1Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 370-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). This signal transduction includes local regulation of dendritic structures via the cytoskeleton and regulation mediated through changes in the transcription of target genes. Therefore, the identification of molecules involved in dendritic morphogenesis is an essential step toward understanding how dendrites develop. Due to the complexity of the developing nervous system, many studies, including the one described here, have used in vitro model systems to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate neuritogenesis (2Ulloa L. Díaz Nido J. Avila J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1633-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 3Pignatelli M. Cortes-Canteli M. Santos A. Perez-Castillo A.

These in vitro systems have also been widely used to study neuronal programmed cell death and the characterization of the genes implicated in its regulation. The present study investigates the role of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) 1The abbreviations used are:C/EBPβCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein βApC/EPBAplysia C/EPBN2ANeuro2ACHOPC/EBP homologous protein 10PI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMAPmicrotubule-associated proteinMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKMAPK/ERK kinase gene on neurite outgrowth and apoptosis of Neuro2A (N2A) cells. The C/EBP family of transcription factors is composed of at least five distinct members (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, C/EBPε, and C/EBPγ) (6Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). These proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation of several cell types. Common structural features of these proteins are highly conserved DNA binding and leucine zipper dimerization domains at the carboxyl terminus and divergent amino termini containing regulatory and transactivation domains (7Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 8Pei D.Q. Shih C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Initially, C/EBPβ has been linked to hepatocyte-specific gene regulation because it shows high expression in liver cells (9Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichsteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and binds to regulatory elements in the promoter of liver-specific genes (10Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that C/EBPβ contributes to regulate the acute phase response of the liver (11Akira S. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 25-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Lately, it has become clear that C/EBPβ also plays a role in other tissues. Results derived from experiments in cell culture and with knockout mice have demonstrated that this protein is critical for lymphocyte (12Müller C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Grieser-Ade S. Graf T. Leutz A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6127-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji H. Fujiwara S. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and adipocyte differentiation (14Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 15Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The role of different C/EBP proteins during adipocyte differentiation is thought to follow a sequential model during which C/EBPδ and C/EBPβ expression precede expression of C/EBPα and correlates with induction of differentiative events (15Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). In fact, expression of C/EBPα is primarily restricted to highly differentiated cells such as hepatocytes, adipocytes, and type II cells of the lung (16Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). This sequential expression of C/EBP isoforms, together with the fact the C/EBPα promoter contains a C/EBP response element, has led to the idea that C/EBPβ can activate the expression of the C/EBPα promoter during differentiation processes such as adipose conversion.

Previous studies have shown that extracellular stimuli can alter the phosphorylation of several sites in C/EBPβ and can modify their effects on promoter activity. Increased transcriptional activities through phosphorylation of distinct sites in rat, chicken, or human C/EBPβ are regulated by many different stimuli of cell proliferation and differentiation, such as phorbol esters/protein kinase C-α, v-erbB, and ras (17Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 18Buck M. Poli V. Van der geer P. Chojkier M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1087-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), suggesting a link among these post-translational modifications, transcriptional activation, and cell function. It has also been reported that phosphorylation of the C/EBPβ protein after insulin stimulation reduces transactivation by interfering with DNA binding or by disrupting interactions with p300/CBP proteins (19Guo S. Cichy SB., He, X. Yang Q. Ragland M. Ghosh A. Johnson P.F. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 8516-8523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Regarding a possible role of C/EBPβ in the brain, it has been shown that C/EBPβ mRNA is widely expressed in the adult mouse brain (20Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Expression of this protein has also been reported in the PC12 cell line, which undergoes differentiation to neuron-like cells in response to nerve growth factor (20Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In these cells, nerve growth factor receptor signaling stimulates activity of C/EBPβ. However, the function of C/EBPβ within the mammalian nervous system is unknown. In the invertebrate Aplysia, it has been shown that the transcription factor Aplysia CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (ApC/EBP) plays an essential role in the consolidation of stable long term synaptic plasticity (21Alberini C.M. Ghirardi M. Metz R. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 1099-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). More recent studies in mammals have suggested an implication of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ in long term synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation in rat hippocampus (22Yukawa K. Tanaka T. Tsuji S. Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31345-31351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here we show that stable-transfected N2A cells overexpressing the C/EBPβ protein present a differentiated phenotype and extend very long neurites even when growing in the presence of serum. This induction of differentiation is accompanied by an increase in the expression of genes associated with the differentiated state and requires activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The neurite outgrowth activity was specific to C/EBPβ transactivation capacity because CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein 10), a dominant negative of this protein, inhibited this outgrowth. In addition, C/EBPβ promotes N2A apoptosis, which is dependent on p53. Finally, we also found that the C/EBPβ protein is broadly distributed in the brain of neonatal rats during a period of intense neuronal maturation. Together, these results suggest that the C/EBPβ protein may play an important role in neuronal maturation and cell death during mammalian brain development. Mouse N2A cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C. For the selection of stably transfected cells, 0.5 × 106cells were seeded into a 6-cm diameter tissue culture plate and incubated overnight. The following day, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with TD buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl) and transfected with 2 μg of pMSV-C/EBPβ (kindly provided by Dr. McKnight, University of Texas, Dallas, TX) by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described previously (23Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Perez-Castillo A. Santos A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 141: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Twelve h after transfection, the medium was replaced with regular growth medium, and the cells were incubated for 24 h, after which they were subcultured at 1:10 dilution with the addition of geneticin (1 mg/ml). The growth medium was renewed every 3 days, and fresh geneticin was added. Cultures were expanded and then screened for C/EBPβ expression. For transient transfection experiments (C/EBPα promoter, pG13-luc, and MG15-luc), semiconfluent cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique in 24-well plates. After 8 h of exposure to the Ca2+/DNA mixture, cells were washed with TD buffer, incubated for another 24 h in regular medium, and harvested for determination of luciferase activity as described previously (24Menendez-Hurtado A. Santos A. Perez-Castillo A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4164-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Each transient transfection experiment was repeated at least three times in duplicate. For the experiment shown in Fig.3 B, the p4 pool was cotransfected with a CHOP expression vector together with a GFP (green fluorescent protein) construct (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) at a ratio of 5:1 by the calcium phosphate method. Twenty-four h after transfection, cell morphology was examined with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. For transient transfection experiments with the constitutively active p110 subunit (K227E) of PI3K, N2A and p4 were transfected using Transfast (Promega, Madison, WI), following the manufacturer’s instructions to achieve a high efficiency of transfection (>80%). For overexpression of C/EBPα protein, full-length C/EBPα was cloned into the pLXSN retroviral vector (CLONTECH). BOSC23 packaging cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and transfected by the calcium phosphate method. Recombinant retroviral particles were collected from the supernatant 2 days later and used to infect N2A and p4 cells. Two days later, cell morphology was examined with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. The rat C/EBPα promoter construct pC/EBPΔ380 has been described previously (24Menendez-Hurtado A. Santos A. Perez-Castillo A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4164-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). pG13 and MG15 reporter plasmids were provided by B. Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD) (25Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), and CHOP, C/EBPα, and K227E p110 expression constructs were provided by N. Holbrook (National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD), Dr. McKnight, and J. Downward (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK), respectively (14Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 26Fawcett T.W. Eastman H.B. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). For morphological analysis, cells were seeded at a density of 20,000/cm2 and grown for 24 h in complete medium, and then some of the plates were placed in serum-free medium and observed 6 h after serum withdrawal. Some cultures were treated with LY294002 (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK), a reversible inhibitor of PI3K used at 10 μm, or PD98059 (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 used at 80 μm. The DF77 polyclonal antibody specific for the C/EBPβ was obtained by injecting rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal portion of this protein (nucleotides 108–419) fused to the glutathione S-transferase protein. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by incubating the antibody with immunizing peptide (1 μm) for 4 h at 4 °C before Western blotting and also by comparing the signal obtained with this antibody with an anti-C/EBPβ commercially available antibody and an anti-C/EBPβ kindly provided by Dr. McKnight. Monoclonal anti-MAP2 and anti-NeuN antibodies were from PharMingen (San Diego, CA) and Chemicon (Temecula, CA), respectively. The polyclonal anti-C/EBPα, commercial anti-C/EBPβ, anti-p21, and monoclonal anti-p53 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). N2A cells were washed twice with TD followed by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of extraction buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). Cells were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle, incubated on ice for 30 min, and spun at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were removed and stored at −70 °C until analysis by gel electrophoresis. Brain protein extracts were obtained as described previously (28Menendez-Hurtado A. Vega-Nuñez E. Santos A. Perez-Castillo A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of protein extracts were loaded onto each lane of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, separated, and then blotted to nitrocellulose membranes at 90 mA overnight in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 190 mm glycine, 20% methanol, 0.5% SDS). Protein loading and transference were checked by Red Ponceau staining of the membranes. For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 130 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with the corresponding primary antibody in TBST buffer with 5% non-fat milk for 2 h, and after several washes, subsequently incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1:5000) in the same buffer. After washing, immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 h, fixed for 10 min with methanol at −20 °C, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 37 °C. After a 1-h incubation with the primary antibody, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the corresponding fluorescein-labeled second antibody for 45 min at 37 °C. The cells were then examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. To calculate the percentage of cell death, 0.5 × 106 cells were seeded in 6-cm diameter tissue culture plates and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h before switching to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum for a further 24 h. For analysis, both the floating cells in the supernatant and the phosphate-buffered saline wash containing the cells were collected from each plate. Apoptosis was assayed using PI staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Cells were analyzed in a FACSscan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson and Co., Bedford, MA), and the forward scatter was plotted against the propidium iodide fluorescence. The data were analyzed using the Cell Quest software package (Becton, Dickinson and Co.). The data were analyzed using the Excell software package. Significant effects were determined using Student’s t test. A statistically significant difference was considered to be present at p < 0.05. The results of in situ hybridization showing a high level of expression of the C/EBPβ mRNA in neural tissue (20Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the presence of the C/EBPβ protein in different brain regions. For this purpose, we raised a polyclonal antibody against a peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal portion of the C/EBPβ protein, which corresponds to the most divergent peptide sequence from the other homologous members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors. Western blot analysis of total protein extracts prepared from different brain regions isolated from 15-day-old rats showed a prominent expression of the C/EBPβ protein in all the regions studied. However, this expression was slightly higher in the cerebellum (Fig.1). C/EBPβ protein was also present in the brain of 5-day-old neonates (data not shown). The same pattern of expression was obtained with a commercial anti-C/EBPβ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and with the c76 polyclonal anti-C/EBPβ antibody provided by Dr. McKnight (data not shown). These data, together with the results presented in Fig.2 A showing a high level of expression of the C/EBPβ protein in the stable transfected N2A cells, demonstrate the specificity of the DF77 antibody.Figure 2Expression of C/EBPβ protein in parental N2A cells and pool p4 (p4).

Pictures were taken at a 400-fold magnification.Bar scale, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To directly assess the participation of the C/EBPβ protein in neuronal function, we generated stably transfected N2A cell lines. The complete C/EBPβ cDNA, cloned into an murine sarcoma virus (MSV)-driven expression vector, was transfected into N2A cells, and different pools of G418-resistant clones were tested for C/EBPβ expression using the DF77 polyclonal antibody. For the rest of the experiments, we chose to use pool p4, which showed very high levels of C/EBPβ protein (Fig. 2 A) as compared with parental N2A cells. The differences in the amount of C/EBPβ protein between parental N2A and p4 cells can also be observed by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 2 B). In parental N2A cells, a weak and diffuse signal can be observed in contrast with a much stronger signal detected in pool p4, which is clearly localized in the nucleus. Because the C/EBPβ protein is a member of a diverse group of transcription factors, its nuclear localization is obviously essential for its subsequent transactivation of target genes. The morphologies of N2A wild type and p4 cells were observed 24 h after they were plated in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. As is apparent from the micrographs in Fig.3 A, overexpression of C/EBPβ induced a dramatic morphological change. We observed a pronounced difference in the phenotype of the parental N2A cells and pool p4 overexpressing the C/EBPβ protein. More than 90% of the control cells showed a round morphology, typical of an undifferentiated state, whereas around 75% of neuroblastoma cells expressing the C/EBPβ protein displayed a more differentiated phenotype. Moreover, when the cells were grown for a further 6 h in serum-free medium (serum starvation induces spontaneous process outgrowth in these cells), almost 100% of p4 cells expressing C/EBPβ had very long and branched neurites, at least two cell bodies in diameter, whereas parental N2A cells only started to extend short projections. The transcription factor CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein 10, also known as GADD153) acts as a dominant negative regulator of C/EBPs by forming stable heterodimers with these proteins and preventing them from binding to DNA (29Foprnace A. Alamo I. Hollander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 30Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Therefore, to ensure that the neurite outgrowth activity in the p4 pool was in fact mediated by the expression of the C/EBPβ protein, pool p4 was transiently cotransfected with a plasmid expression vector for CHOP and GFP. After transfection, cells were maintained in culture under growth conditions for 24 h. Transfected cells could be identified by GFP fluorescence. Twenty four h after transfection, most GFP-expressing cells (80%) adopted a round morphology. In contrast, we rarely found GFP-expressing cells with a differentiated phenotype, suggesting that the phenotype observed was indeed due to C/EBPβ overexpression (Fig. 3 B). To examine whether phosphorylation of C/EBPβ is required for the morphological changes observed in p4, we used inhibitors of MAPK (Erks) and PI3K signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 4, the change in cell morphology induced by C/EBPβ in the p4 cells was completely blocked by pretreatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 but not with the MEK inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that the PI3K pathway, but not the MAP kinase pathway, is required for C/EBPβ-induced neurite outgrowth. These results were further confirmed by transient transfection of p4 cells with a constitutively active p110 subunit (K227E) of PI3K. As shown in Fig. 4, transfection with the Myc-tagged K227E p100 plasmid significantly increased the number of cells with a differentiated phenotype, as well as the number of neurites/cell and the length of these prolongations. In contrast, parental N2A cells transfected with the same construct did not show any significant change in cell morphology, suggesting that in fact, C/EBPβ is required for the effects triggered by PI3K activation. We next examined the levels of two neuronal-specific markers: microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and NeuN in parental N2A and p4 cells. A striking difference was observed between parental N2A cells and p4. Under basal conditions (cells growing in the presence of fetal bovine serum for 24 h), only a low amount of MAP2 protein could be found in N2A non-transfected cells, and very few immunoreactive MAP2-expressing cells were observed (Fig.5, A and B), which is in agreement with the undifferentiated phenotype presented by these cells. On the contrary, Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in the amount of MAP2 protein in cells overexpressing C/EBPβ. Increased expression of MAP2 protein was also confirmed by immunofluorescence wherein pool p4 showed a very strong signal, in contrast to the very weak signal observed in N2A progenitor cells. Similar results were observed with NeuN, a neuronal cell type-specific nuclear protein expressed in postmitotic neurons (31Mullen R. Buck C.R. Smith A.M. Development. 1992; 116: 201-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5Effect of C/EBPβ on neuronal marker expression in N2A cells and pool 4.

Immunofluorescence studies revealed that this protein is localized in the nucleus, as expected (Fig. 5 C). We next determined whether, as happens during adipocyte differentiation, the expression of C/EBPα could be increased in N2A cells overexpressing C/EBPβ protein and therefore whether C/EBPα could play a role in maintaining the neuronal differentiated phenotype. Our results show a striking increase in the amount of endogenous C/EBPα protein in p4 cells, as determined by immunofluorescence (Fig. 6 A) and Western blot (Fig. 6 B) analysis. We also tested whether the increase in the levels of C/EBPα protein could be due to a direct effect of C/EBPβ on C/EBPα promoter activity. To this end, we performed transient transfections in parental N2A and in p4 cells with a reporter construct containing 380 bp of the promoter region of the C/EBPαlinked to a luciferase reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 6 C, transactivation of the reporter construct was significantly increased (5.5-fold) in cells stably expressing the C/EBPβ protein, suggesting that the observed increase in the amount of C/EBPα protein is due, at least in part, to an induction in the transcription of this gene by C/EBPβ. Finally, we tested whether C/EBPα itself could induce parental N2A differentiation and also produce a more differentiated phenotype in cells overexpressing C/EBPβ. Consequently, we infected parental N2A and p4 cells with a retroviral expression vector for C/EBPα. As shown in Fig. 7, 2 days after viral infection, more than 60% of parental N2A cells had a differentiated phenotype, as compared with 15% in N2A cells transfected with the empty vector. P4 cells overexpressing C/EBPα presented very long neurites,"

All radicals are derived from superoxide (O2),1 which is generated by the NADPH-derived one-electron reduction of oxygen, catalyzed by a membrane-associated flavocytochrome (cytochromeb 559) (reviewed in Refs. 1Leto T.L.

Cytochromeb 559 is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, a 91-kDa glycoprotein (gp91phox) and a 22-kDa protein (p22phox) (3Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The gp91phox subunit bears all the redox stations responsible for the transport of electrons from NADPH to oxygen as follows: an NADPH-binding site and noncovalently bound FAD (4Rotrosen D.

Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Stimuli eliciting O2 production by phagocytes initiate a signal transduction sequence that, ultimately, leads to the conversion of cytochrome b 559 from a resting to an activated form. This is probably the consequence of a conformational change in gp91phox and is brought about by the translocation to the membrane environment of some or all of four cytosolic regulatory proteins, p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTPase Rac (1 or 2). It is assumed that this leads to the direct interaction of at least some of the cytosolic components with cytochrome b 559 and the formation of a membrane-associated multicomponent complex of yet unknown composition, stability, and reversibility. This process is termed NADPH oxidase assembly, and the multiple protein-protein interactions among the cytosolic components and between some of these and the cytochromeb 559 subunits were and are the subject of intense investigation (reviewed in Refs. 7De Leo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 8Sumimoto H. Ito T. Hata K. Mizuki K. Nakamura R. Kage Y. Sakaki Y. Nakamura M. Takeshige K. Hamasaki N.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exposed to a critical concentration of anionic amphiphiles, such as arachidonate or SDS. The identity of the cytosolic component(s) responsible for causing the conformational change in gp91phox is a still an unsettled issue, as well as the question of whether this is the consequence of direct interaction of the cytosolic component(s) with gp91phoxor an event secondary to its binding to the p22phox subunit. Despite the fact that the p22phox subunit does not contain redox centers, its presence is essential for NADPH oxidase assembly, as shown by the lack O2 production by phagocytes of patients with chronic granulomatous diseases (CGD), with a mutation in p22phox (13Leusen J.H.W. Bolscher B.G.J.M. Hilarius P.M. Weening R.S. Kaulfersch W. Seger R.A. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. J. Exp.

U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This suggested that p22phox might serve as a linker protein between cytosolic components and gp91phox. This hypothesis is supported by extensive experimental evidence showing that a proline-rich region in the C-terminal region of p22phox interacts with the N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of p47phox (14Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 15Leto T.L. Adams A.G. De Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This interaction is related to the activation of NADPH oxidase; the accepted view is that phosphorylation of specific serine residues in a cationic C-terminal region of p47phox (in vivo) or exposure to anionic amphiphile (in vitro) leads to the disruption of intramolecular bonds between the N-terminal SH3 domain and a C-terminal region in p47phox, allowing the establishment of the intermolecular bond with p22phox (16Ago T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13793-13801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). So far, no other protein-protein interaction involving p22phox and a cytosolic protein, other than p47phox, has been observed. The possibility that such interactions nevertheless occur is raised by findings showing interactions between p67phox and Rac and cytochromeb 559. Thus, the NADPH oxidase can be activatedin vitro, in the absence of p47phox, by p67phox and Rac, at high concentrations (18Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22578-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 19Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These findings are in good agreement with the proposal that p67phox is the protein directly responsible for the induction of a conformational change in gp91phox and with the identification of an “activation domain” in p67phox, responsible for interaction with cytochrome b 559 (21Han C.-H.

Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It was implied that p67phox interacts directly with the gp91phox subunit (22Nisimoto Y. Motalebi S. Han C.-H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), a contention for which experimental proof was provided only recently (23Dang P.M.-C. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3001-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is of interest and relevance to the results presented in this paper that no direct interaction between p67phox and p22phox was ever reported despite the fact p67phoxcontains two SH3 domains as follows: one was found to interact with a proline-rich domain in the C terminus of p47phox (24Finan P. Shimizu Y. Gout I. Hsuan J. Truong O. Butcher C. Bennett P. Waterfield M.D. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13752-13755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the other was possibly engaged in an intramolecular bond with a proline-rich domain at the center of the molecule (proposed in Ref. 1Leto T.L. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 3rd Ed. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1999: 769-786Google Scholar). It was also suggested that cytochrome b 559serves as a direct target for Rac. This was based on the finding that maintenance of Rac2 in the membrane, following translocation, depends on its interaction with cytochrome b 559 (25Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was suggested that the insert region of Rac1 is involved (26Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for binding of Rac2 to cytochromeb 559 was recently presented (27Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In all these reports it was implied that the target of Rac is gp91phox; however, there was no direct evidence for this, and the possibility that the effect on gp91phox is secondary to the interaction of Rac with p22phox could not be excluded. We introduced an approach to the mapping of domains involved in protein-protein interactions between individual components of an enzymatic complex, termed “peptide walking.” This is based on breaking down the complete sequence of the protein under investigation in a series of overlapping synthetic peptides and using these peptides as either inhibitors of an enzymatic reaction involving the parent protein or as ligands to which interacting proteins will bind. Peptide walking was used earlier for mapping functional domains in Rac1 (28Joseph G. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29079-29082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and p47phox (29Morozov I. Lotan O. Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15435-15444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The present report describes the first attempt to apply peptide walking to the analysis of a membrane component, namely to the p22phox subunit of cytochrome b 559. Because p22phox is viewed principally as a linker element between gp91phox and the cytosolic components of the NADPh oxidase complex and its size was not prohibitive, it seemed particularly suited for this methodology. Peptide walking reveals the existence in p22phox of three, previously undetected, binding sites for p67phox, one of which overlaps the known proline-rich region, also binding p47phox; it also demonstrates the existence of a second binding region for p47phox, in addition to that associated with the proline-rich region. These results form the basis of a revised membrane topology model for p22phox, in which a cytosolic loop serves as an anchor for both p47phox and p67phox, distinct from the proline-rich domain localized in the cytosolic C-terminal tail. A library of 91 overlapping pentadecapeptides (PepSets), spanning the complete amino acid sequence of p22phox (30Parkos C.A. Dinauer M.C. Walker L.E. Allen R.A. Jesaitis A.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), was synthesized by the multipin synthesis method (31Shpungin S. Dotan I. Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9195-9203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by Mimotopes (Clayton, Australia). Peptides overlapped by 13 residues and were biotinylated at the N terminus and amidated at the C terminus. The biotin group was attached by the intermediary of a 4-residue spacer, consisting of SGSG. The purity of the peptides ranged from 60 to 70%. Two batches of 91 peptides (1 μmol of each peptide) were used in the reported experiments, with identical results. The freeze-dried peptides were dissolved in a mixture of 75 parts dimethyl sulfoxide and 25 parts water (v/v), to a concentration of 1.5 mm, divided in 50-μl aliquots, and kept frozen at −75 °C. PepSets were used exclusively for screening experiments; for work with individual peptides found active by initial screening, purified synthetic peptides were used. These were also synthesized by Mimotopes but had a purity of ≥70%, confirmed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and ion spray mass spectrometry.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) and modified for use with 96-well plates, as detailed in technical bulletin 1177EC (Bio-Rad). Bovine serum albumin was used as standard. NADPH oxidase activation was assayed in a semi-recombinant cell-free system consisting of macrophage membrane vesicles and recombinant cytosolic components, with lithium dodecyl sulfate (LiDS), serving as the anionic amphiphilic activator, as described (34Toporik A. Gorzalczany Y. Hirshberg M. Pick E. Lotan O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, the basic system contained membranes, equivalent to 10 nm cytochrome b 559heme, and p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1, exchanged to GTPγS (as described in Ref. 20Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M.

LiDS was added to a concentration of 130 μm, and incubation was performed in 96-well microplates (Greiner; flat bottom; catalog number 655101) in a total volume of 100 μl of assay buffer (for composition, see Ref. 34Toporik A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 28 measurements, at 11-s intervals, were executed using a SpectraMax 340 microplate reader (Molecular Devices), fitted with Softmax Pro software. Results were expressed as nanomoles of O2/min produced per well. Specificity of cytochrome c reduction was confirmed by its prevention by superoxide dismutase. In all experiments, each measurement was performed in triplicate. The effect p22phox peptides on NADPH oxidase activation was tested in the system described above. Peptides were diluted from the 1.5 mm stock solution to a concentration of 100 μm, and an amount of 10 μl was added per well, as the first component of a 100-μl reaction mixture (resulting in a final concentration of 10 μm peptide). When dose-response experiments were executed, the peptides were diluted to result in final concentrations in the assay varying from 0.6 to 40 μm. To control wells, 10 μl of assay buffer supplemented with dimethyl sulfoxide were added, to result in a final concentration of solvent identical to that found in the peptide-containing wells. This was followed by the addition of 60 μl of assay buffer and 10 μl of a mixture of p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1-GTPγS, to reach a final concentration of 50 nm each. The contents of the wells were incubated with mixing for 5 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker, to allow the interaction between peptide and one or more of the cytosolic components. Following this, 10 μl of macrophage membrane vesicles, equivalent to a final concentration of cytochromeb 559 heme of 10 nm and 10 μl of assay buffer, containing LiDS, to achieve a final concentration of 130 μm, were added. The 96-well plate was reincubated for 90 s at room temperature, with mixing and O2 production initiated by the addition of 10 μl of NADPH, to reach a final concentration of 454 μm. The effect of a peptide on NADPH oxidase activation was expressed as percent inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation; this was calculated by considering O2 production by control mixtures (in the absence of peptide) as 100%. To assess the effects of peptides not related to NADPH oxidase assembly, we examined the effect of p22phox peptides added after the completion of NADPH oxidase activation. In these experiments, membranes, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1-GTPγS were mixed at the concentrations listed above and supplemented with 130 μmLiDS. 90-μl amounts of the mixture were added to wells of a microplate and incubated for 1.5–5 min, at room temperature, to induce NADPH oxidase assembly. The peptides were then added to a final concentration of 10 μm, and after 30 s of incubation, NADPH was added to a final concentration of 454 μm, and O2 production was measured, as described above. This assay was first used by us for the mapping of domains on p47phox interacting with p67phox(29Morozov I. Lotan O. Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15435-15444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present experiments we applied a modified version of this methodology, which is described below. The experiments were performed in 96-well microplates, with flat bottom and rounded corners (MaxiSorp C96, product 430341, Nunc). The plates were coated with streptavidin (from Streptomyces avidinii, affinity-purified, product S4762, Sigma), 100 μl (16.6 pmol) per well, as described before (29Morozov I. Lotan O. Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15435-15444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A number of experiments were also performed with ready-made streptavidin-coated 96-well plates (Combiplate 8 Streptavidin 200 μl, code 95029263; Labsystems), with results indistinguishable from those obtained with plates coated by us. To each well were added 300 μl of a blocking solution, consisting of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 140 mmNaCl; PBS) supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaureate (Tween 20), and 1% sodium caseinate, and the plate kept for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed four times with 300 μl/well of PBS, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), using an automatic microplate washer (Wellwash Ascent, Labsystems). To groups of three wells, we added 100 μl of a 2 μm biotinylated peptide solution (200 pmol/well), and the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, with rotary mixing, to allow binding of the peptides to the immobilized streptavidin. Unbound peptide was removed by four washes of 300 μl/well of PBS-T. At this stage, one of the three recombinant cytosolic NADPH oxidase components was added to the wells, in 100-μl amounts, corresponding to 200 pmol/well of the respective proteins (p47phox, p67phox, or Rac-GTPγS), diluted in NADPH oxidase assay buffer (34Toporik A. Gorzalczany Y. Hirshberg M. Pick E. Lotan O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), supplemented with 1% sodium caseinate. The components were incubated with the peptides on a orbital shaker for either 1 h at room temperature (p47phox) or 18 h at 4 °C (p67phox and Rac1). Unbound components were removed by four washes of 300 μl/well of PBS-T, and the amounts of bound component were quantified by the use of polyclonal goat antisera against purified recombinant p47phox(diluted 1/1000) and p67phox (diluted 1/500) (35Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fujii H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Thomas L. Leto, and of a rabbit antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 178–191 of Rac1 (catalog number sc-217; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (diluted 1/500). Primary antibodies, diluted in PBS-T, containing 1% sodium caseinate (100 μl per well) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, with orbital shaking. The wells were washed four times with PBS-T and covered with 100 μl/well of the corresponding secondary antibodies, diluted in PBS-T, supplemented with 1% sodium caseinate. These were peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified rabbit anti-goat IgG at a dilution of 1/10,000 for anti-p47phox and 1/5,000 for anti-p67phox, and goat anti-rabbit IgG, diluted 1/10,000, for anti-Rac1. The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, with orbital shaking, and subjected to four washes with 300 μl/well of PBS-T and two washes with 300 μl/well of PBS. Detection of peroxidase was performed with a ready-to-use 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate system (Sigma, product number T8665) by adding 200 μl of solution per well and incubating for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl/well of 0.5 mH2SO4 solution and the absorbance read at 450 nm, against blank wells containing only the peroxidase assay reagent, in a SpectraMax 340 microplate reader. Ninety one overlapping pentadecapeptides, spanning the complete amino acid sequence of p22phox, were tested for the ability to interfere with the process of amphiphile-elicited NADPH oxidase activation in a cell-free system, consisting of membrane vesicles and recombinant p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1-GTPγS. Fig.1 lists the peptides employed in these experiments and the location of the corresponding sequences within the p22phox protein. The N-terminal spacer sequence SGSG, to which biotin is attached, does not appear in the list. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the first time that peptides derived from the sequence of a membrane-spanning protein were tested for a possible inhibitory effect on a biochemical reaction involving the parent protein. Many of these peptides are expected to be hydrophobic. We therefore plotted the degree of hydrophobicity of the individual overlapping peptides, determined as described in Ref. 36Fauchere J.-L. Pliska V. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 18: 369-375Google Scholar (on the y axis), against the location of the sequences represented by the peptides (the position of the N-terminal residue of each peptide) in the intact protein (on the x axis). As can be seen in Fig. 2 A, there are two major groups of hydrophobic peptides. The first ranges from residue 1 to residue 50 and corresponds to a transmembranal region, as proposed by several authors. The second extends from residue 63 to 125 and roughly overlaps a second proposed transmembranal region. A small cluster of hydrophilic peptides, peaking between residues 53 and 59, is of special interest in light of our proposal that this corresponds to the N-terminal half of a cytosolic loop, the existence of which was proposed and which, based on the results to be described, might serve as an anchor for cytosolic components p47phox and p67phox (see “Discussion” for earlier proposals of the membrane topology of p22phox). Peptides corresponding to the C-terminal region of p22phox, starting from residue 127, were mildly hydrophobic or hydrophilic, in good agreement with the commonly accepted view that the C terminus forms a cytosolic “tail.” Next, the relative net charge of each peptide (on the yaxis) was also plotted against the location of the peptide in the intact protein. Each lysine, arginine, or histidine contributed one positive charge unit, whereas each glutamate and aspartate contributed one negative charge unit. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, there was a large cluster of basic peptides, extending from residue 45 to 93. This corresponds to the hydrophilic peptide cluster and the N-terminal half of the second hydrophobic cluster and sets, roughly, the N- and C-terminal limits of the full-length of the cytosolic loop, as suggested by us. A second basic cluster, extending from residue 125 to 155, corresponds to the N-terminal half of the cytosolic tail. The effect of p22phox peptides was determined in a semi-recombinant cell-free system, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using a fixed concentration of membrane (equivalent to 10 nm cytochrome b 559 heme), and p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1-GTPγS, at identical concentrations (50 nm). This concentration was chosen based on the finding that, in NADPH oxidase activation dose-response experiments, 50 nm was just below the plateau level and that the three cytosolic components are known to translocate to the membrane at equimolar concentrations (37Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The design of the experiments was such as to allow preliminary interaction of p22phox peptides with any of the three cytosolic components, which were looked upon as potential candidates for interaction with p22phox. Thus, peptides, at a concentration of 10 μm, were preincubated for 5 min with a mixture of the three cytosolic components (at a 200-fold lower concentration), and then membranes were added, together with the activating amphiphile.

The molecular, biochemical, and genetic characterization of ADOMETDC establishes that it is essential in L. donovani promastigotes and a potential target for therapeutic validation. The protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, a devastating and often fatal disease in humans. The parasite exhibits a digenetic life cycle with the extracellular promastigote residing in the phlebotomine sandfly vector and the intracellular amastigote propagating within the phagolysosome of mammalian macrophages. Because no effective vaccine for leishmaniasis is available, chemotherapy offers the only means of disease treatment. However, the current arsenal of drugs for treating leishmaniasis is far from ideal because these compounds are moderately to highly toxic, the result of their lack of target specificity. Recently, the emergence of drug-resistant strains has exacerbated the need for more selective and efficacious drugs to treat or prevent leishmaniasis or, for that matter, many other parasitic diseases. One pathway that has been exploited successfully in antiparasitic drug regimens is that for the synthesis of polyamines, organic cations that play indispensable roles in key cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and macromolecular biosynthesis (1Tabor C.W.

The selective window for drug efficacy is not achieved, however, by dissimilar DFMO binding affinities for the T. brucei and human ODC enzymes but rather to differences in enzyme stability (6Ghoda L. van Daalen Wetters T.

MDL 73811 is an irreversible inhibitor of ADOMETDC, the enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), generating the decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dAdoMet) substrate for spermidine synthase (SPDSYN). In addition to MDL 73811, ADOMETDC is also inhibited in vitro by a battery of other trypanocidal drugs, including pentamidine, berenil, and methylglyoxyl bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG). Pentamidine is also the second most prescribed drug for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. However, even though the T. brucei ADOMETDC enzyme is inhibited by each of these compounds, the intracellular target for these drugs has not been established. Indeed, other cellular targets for pentamidine and berenil have been proposed (14Basselin M. Badet-Denisot M.A. Robert-Gero M. Acta Trop. 1998; 70: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Basselin M. Robert-Gero M. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Singh R. Siddiqui K.A.

To determine whether ADOMETDC inhibition is a valid therapeutic paradigm and to elucidate the cellular targets of inhibitors of ADOMETDC in a model and genetically tractable parasite, theADOMETDC gene and its flanking sequences have been isolated from L. donovani. These DNAs were used to generate Δadometdc knockouts employing double targeted gene replacement strategies (18Cruz A. Beverley S.M.

The Δadometdc L. donovani were shown to be auxotrophic for spermidine, and incubation of these parasites in the absence of exogenous polyamines resulted in a marked depletion in the cellular pools of both spermidine and trypanothione, a spermidine-containing thiol conjugate. Furthermore, the ADOMETDC overproducers were resistant to MDL 73811 but not to the other ADOMETDC inhibitors, establishing that the enzyme is the primary intracellular target for only one of the four antiparasitic drugs that target the enzyme in vitro. The pX63NEO, pX63HYG, pX63PAC, and pXNEO plasmids used in the transfection experiments were provided by Dr. Stephen M. Beverley (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Spermidine, putrescine, MTA, berenil, pentamidine, and MGBG were obtained from Sigma. Hygromycin was procured from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, G418 was purchased from BioWhittaker, and MDL 73811 was a gift from the now defunct Marion Merrell Dow Research Institute. The wild type L. donovani clone, DI700, originally derived from the 1S Sudanese strain, was used for DNA isolation, library construction, and as a recipient strain in the initial transfections. L. donovani promastigotes were propagated in DME-L, a completely defined Dulbecco's modified Eagle-based medium especially designed for Leishmaniacultivation (21Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Transfected parasites were maintained in a modified medium, DME-L-CS, in which the bovine serum albumin component was replaced with 10% chicken serum to avoid polyamine oxidase-mediated toxicity (11Kaur K. Emmett K. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Ullman B. J. Protozool. 1986; 33: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ADOMETDC/adometdc heterozygote and the Δadometdc null mutants were routinely maintained in DME-L-CS supplemented with either 50 μg/ml hygromycin or 50 μg/ml hygromycin, 20 μg/ml G418, and 100 μm spermidine, respectively, unless otherwise specified. The ADOMETDCoverexpressor, DI700[pADOMETDC], and DI700 parasites transfected with just pXNEO, DI700[pXNEO], were grown in DME-L-CS and 20 μg/ml G418. The Δadometdc null mutants transfected with pX63PAC[ADOMETDC], designated Δadometdc[pADOMETDC], were propagated in DME-L-CS to which 50 μg/ml hygromycin, 20 μg/ml G418, and 100 μm puromycin were added. Growth rate experiments were conducted and parasites enumerated on a hemacytometer (Hausser Scientific Co.) or a Coulter Counter model ZF as described (11Kaur K. Emmett K. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A.

The sense primer, 5′-CTCGGAATTCC-TT[CT]-GAG-GG[CGT]-[AC]C[CG]-GAG-AA-3′, was constructed with an 11-nucleotide leader encompassing anEcoRI site (underlined) followed by a degenerate sequence corresponding to amino acids 7–12, FEGTEK, of the human ADOMETDC, whereas the antisense primer, 5′-CTCGGGATCCC-CTC-[ACG]GG-[CG]GT-[AG]AT-GTG-3′, was generated from residues 243–248, HITPEP of the human ADOMETDC and was preceded by an 11-nucleotide leader encompassing aBamHI restriction site (underlined). Amplification of theADOMETDC fragment was performed on a Coy Instruments thermocycler using the PCR conditions described by Hanson et al. (22Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting 720-bp fragment was sequenced according to the dideoxy termination method and used to screen an L. donovani EMBL3 genomic library (23Wilson K. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Stringer J.R.

A 5.1-kb SalI fragment that hybridized to the probe was subcloned from a plaque-purified phage into pBluescript KS+, and the entire nucleotide sequence of theADOMETDC open reading frame (ORF) was obtained in both orientations. In addition, portions of the ADOMETDC 5′- and 3′-flanking regions were also sequenced. Multiple sequence alignments with ADOMETDC proteins from phylogenetically diverse organisms were performed using the Feng-Doolittle algorithm (24Feng D.F. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1987; 25: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). To raise antibodies against ADOMETDC, the ADOMETDC gene was inserted into the pBAce prokaryotic expression vector and then induced in low phosphate induction medium as described (25Allen T.E. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5431-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The protein was recovered in virtually pure form as inclusion bodies and employed as immunogen to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals Inc.) using standard injection protocols. Immunoblot analysis was carried out according to standard protocols (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Manniatis T.

To construct drug resistance cassettes to replace bothADOMETDC alleles, ∼300 bp of 5′- and ∼1 kb of 3′-flanking regions were subcloned into the appropriate sites of the pX63HYG and pX63NEO plasmids. The 5′-flanking region, 5′F, was amplified by PCR using the M13-20 oligonucleotide (containing pBluescript sequence) as a sense primer and an antisense primer, 5′-GGGAAAAGCGTCGACAAGAGGCGATGAGC-3′, preceded by anSalI site (underlined) and corresponding to a region ∼120 nucleotides upstream from the ADOMETDC ORF. The ∼1,200-bp PCR product was digested with SalI and HindIII, a restriction site located ∼300 bp upstream from the SalI site, and 5′F was then subcloned into theHindIII/SalI sites of pX63HYG and pX63NEO. The resulting plasmids were termed pX63HYG-5′F and pX63NEO-5′F, respectively. To amplify the 3′-flank, a sense primer, 5′-GTCCCCGGGCCGCCCCCCTTATCCCC-3′, and an antisense primer, 5′-CTCAGATCTCCCTTTAGTGAGGG-3′, containing SmaI and BglII restriction sites (underlined), respectively, were designed. The ∼1-kb PCR product, 3′F, was then subcloned into the corresponding sites of pX63HYG-5′F and pX63NEO-5′F to yield the knockout constructs, pX63NEOΔadometdc and pX63HYGΔadometdc, respectively. The correct orientation of 5′F and 3′F within the two drug resistance cassettes was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and limited nucleotide sequencing. The ADOMETDC ORF was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pXNEO and pX63PAC vectors to create pXNEO[ADOMETDC] and pX63PAC[ADOMETDC], respectively. Oligonucleotides used for the construction of pXNEO[ADOMETDC] were 5′-TCTGGATCCAGCGGCTCTGAGGCG-3′ (BamHI site underlined) for the sense primer and 5′-TCCTCTAGAGTGATGACCTTTGCG-3′ (XbaI site underlined) for the antisense primer. The PCR product was then subcloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the leishmanial expression vector pXNEO to create pXNEO[ADOMETDC]. To amplify the ADOMETDC ORF for insertion into pX63PAC, both the sense primer, 5′-GCAGGATCCACCATGAATGTCGC-3′, and the antisense primer, 5′-CGCGGATCCAAGAACTAGTCGGGCC-3′, contained BamHI restriction sites. The PCR product was then subcloned into theBamHI site of pX63PAC to create pX63PAC[ADOMETDC], and the correct orientation was ascertained by further restriction enzyme digestion. The Δadometdc null strains were generated from wild type L. donovani by double targeted gene replacement. The pX63HYGΔadometdc and pX63NEOΔadometdc plasmids were digested withHindIII and BglII, and the fragments containing the ADOMETDC flanking regions and drug resistance markers, designated HYGΔadometdc and NEOΔadometdc, respectively, were gel purified and transfected into wild type parasites and ADOMETDC/adometdc heterozygotes, respectively, using previously reported electroporation conditions (19Jiang Y.

ClonalADOMETDC/adometdc heterozygotes were selected on plates in semisolid DME-L-CS medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and the genotypes were confirmed by Southern blotting. Clonal Δadometdc knockout lines were then obtained from a heterozygote clone after a second round of transfection and plating in DME-L-CS medium supplemented with 100 μm spermidine, 100 μm MTA, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and 20 μg/ml G418. The genotypes of the null mutants were again verified by Southern blotting. ADOMETDC overproducers were also generated after transfection. DI700 parasites were transfected with pXNEO[ADOMETDC] and selected in DME-L-CS medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 to produce DI700[pADOMETDC]. The Δadometdc line was transfected with pX63PAC[ADOMETDC] and the Δadometdc[pADOMETDC] overexpressor isolated in DME-L-CS supplemented with 50 μg/ml hygromycin, 20 μg/ml G418, and 100 μm puromycin. ADOMETDC overproduction was ascertained by immunoblotting. Polyamine, thiol, and dAdoMet pools were measured as reported previously (19Jiang Y. Roberts S.C. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Shih S.

The gene encoding ADOMETDC was isolated on a 5.1-kb SalI fragment using a 720-bpADOMETDC PCR fragment as a hybridization probe. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified a 1,149-bp ORF encoding a protein of 382 amino acids with a molecular mass of 44.2 kDa for the proenzyme and 33.1 and 11.1 kDa for the α and β subunits, respectively. An in-frame termination codon was located 27 nucleotides upstream from the assigned initiation codon.

A multisequence alignment revealed several regions of high homology, most notably in the putative proenzyme cleavage site between amino acids Glu-90 and Ser-91 of the L. donovanienzyme (34Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E.

Southern blot analysis of L. donovani genomic DNA demonstrated thatADOMETDC is a single copy gene, and Northern blots revealed the existence of a single ADOMETDC 1.8-kb transcript inL. donovani promastigotes (data not shown). Because the mammalian ADOMETDC is known to turn over very rapidly (the half-life is <1 h) (36Pegg A.E. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1984; 2: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 37White M.W. Morris D.R. Bachrach U. Heimer Y.M. The Physiology of Polyamines. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 331-343Google Scholar, 38Heby O. Persson L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 153-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), the stability of ADOMETDC in L. donovanipromastigotes was examined. Unlike the mammalian enzyme, however, ADOMETDC is stable up to 24 h after treatment with cycloheximide at a concentration that obliterates protein synthesis in L. donovani (22Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the amount of ADOMETDC protein after 24 h of cycloheximide treatment is equivalent to that of exponentially growing parasites (Fig.2). To disrupt the ADOMETDC locus in L. donovani, each gene copy was sequentially replaced with a drug resistance cassette. The first ADOMETDC copy was replaced with pX63HYGΔadometdc, and clonalADOMETDC/adometdc heterozygotes were selected in hygromycin. A second round of transfection with pX63NEOΔadometdcreplaced the second ADOMETDC allele, and clonal strains of Δadometdc knockout parasites were selected in hygromycin, G418, MTA, and spermidine. The presence of hygromycin during the second round of gene targeting ensured that the pX63NEOΔadometdchad replaced the wild type allele in the ADOMETDC/adometdcheterozygotes, whereas spermidine and MTA were added to the selective medium to bypass any potential auxotrophy. Approximately 16 colonies were picked from plates after the second round of gene targeting. After initial screenings, two of these clones, Δadometdc13 and Δadometdc14, were selected for further analysis. Southern blot analysis of SalI-digested genomic DNA prepared from wild type, ADOMETDC/adometdc, Δadometdc13, and Δadometdc14 parasites hybridized to theADOMETDC ORF clearly demonstrated the loss of bothADOMETDC copies in the knockout lines (Fig.3, panel A). Southern blot analysis of SacI-cut DNA and probing with theADOMETDC 5′- and 3′-flanking regions, 5′F and 3′F, respectively, revealed the precise nature of the rearrangements observed after the homologous recombination events that gave rise to the heterozygous and homozygous genotypes. The creation of the novel and loss of the wild type alleles are unveiled by probing with either 5′F (Fig. 3, panel B) or 3′F (Fig. 3, panel C). Replacement of the wild type ADOMETDC copies by HYGΔadometdc and NEOΔadometdc created an additional 3.8-kb SacI fragment that hybridized to 5′F (Fig.3, panel B) and a 5.5-kb SacI fragment recognized by 3′F (Fig. 3, panel C). The loss of the remaining wild type allele from the heterozygote is apparent after the second round of transfection with NEOΔadometdc in both knockout lines (Fig. 3, panels B and C). Partial restriction maps of the wild type and replaced loci are depicted in Fig. 3,panel D. It is worth noting that 3′F also recognizes other sequences within the L. donovani genome and gives rise to the unexpected background signals in Fig. 3, panel C. These signals were unaffected by any of the recombination events at theADOMETDC locus. The loss of the wild type ADOMETDC copies was corroborated via Western blot analysis of ADOMETDC overproducer, wild type, Δadometdc13 and Δadometdc14 lysates (Fig.4). Whereas the polyclonal antibodies recognize a single polypeptide of ∼35 kDa, no band is observed in either of the knockout strains. This band presumably corresponds to the α subunit of ADOMETDC because it is consistent with the predicted molecular mass from the translated nucleotide sequence. The antibodies do not appear to recognize the β subunit of the enzyme with sufficient avidity for visualization by immunoblotting. Equal loading of protein lysates from wild type and knockout strains onto the gel was confirmed by normalization of the immunoblots to antisera raised against the purine salvage enzyme, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. To evaluate the nutritional requirements of the Δadometdcstrains, the knockout parasites were incubated in growth medium with and without polyamines or MTA. As shown in Fig.5 A, wild type andADOMETDC/adometdc grown in defined DME-L-CS without polyamine supplementation grew equally well, whereas the Δadometdc13 and Δadometdc14 cells did not proliferate at all. The null mutants incubated under these conditions arrested after three to four cell divisions, assumed a rounded morphology, and died after 4 weeks. The addition of 100 μm spermidine was able to circumvent the phenotypic consequences of the genetic lesion in Δadometdc parasites, whereas an equivalent concentration of putrescine or MTA, a product of the Leishmania dADOMETC reaction, did not rescue the parasites (Fig. 5 B). Finally, the growth defect of Δadometdc parasites was also not restored by the addition of 100 μm spermine, a polyamine that is not found inL. donovani (19Jiang Y. Roberts S.C. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Shih S. Ariyanayagam M. Fairlamb A.H. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3781-3788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), to the culture medium (data not shown). The failure of these compounds to rescue the knockouts could not be imputed to their inherent toxicity because none of these compounds adversely affected the viability or growth of wild type L. donovani (data not shown). The ability of spermidine to circumvent the polyamine auxotrophy of Δadometdc parasites demonstrates that the sole cellular function of dAdoMet is to serve as an aminopropyl donor in spermidine synthesis and that MTA production by this pathway is nonessential for L. donovanipromastigotes. To establish that the auxotrophic phenotype observed in the knockout parasites could be ascribed to the genetic lesions at the ADOMETDC locus, an episomal copy of the ADOMETDC gene was introduced into the Δadometdc14 line by transfection and amplified in the selective drug. As shown in Fig.6 A, two different clonal populations of Δadometdc[pADOMETDC] parasites contained levels of ADOMETDC protein significantly greater than that of wild type parasites (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, complementation of the knockout strain restored the ability of the parasites to proliferate in polyamine-deficient medium (Fig. 6 B). In fact, the growth rate was slightly greater than that of wild type parasites. To evaluate the consequences of polyamine starvation on the intracellular polyamine and reduced thiol pools, Δadometdc14 parasites were incubated in polyamine-free medium for 8 days. During this incubation, when parasites were not dividing, the intracellular levels of spermidine decreased significantly with a concomitant increase in the intracellular putrescine pool (Fig.7 A). The putrescine:spermidine ratio increased from an initial 1.4 prior to the experiment to a final ratio of 60 after 8 days of incubation in the polyamine-deficient DME-L-CS. The absolute concentrations of both polyamines were similar in wild type (10 nmol of putrescine/108 cells and 10 nmol of spermidine/108 cells) and Δadometdc14 parasites when the latter were maintained in spermidine (16 nmol of putrescine/108 cells and 6 nmol of spermidine/108 cells). Concurrent with the spermidine depletion was a diminution in the level of reduced trypanothione, a spermidine-containing thiol conjugate, and an increase in the pool of glutathione, the thiol precursor for trypanothione synthesis (Fig.7 B). Although trypanothione levels were 4-fold higher than glutathione levels in the Δadometdc14 parasites that had been maintained in spermidine-supplemented"

The open reading frame predicted a protein of 184 amino acids related to theVaccinia virus VH1 and human VH1-related (VHR) phosphatases. Expression VHR-related MKPX (VHX) was highest in thymus, but also detectable in monocytes and lymphocytes. A VHX-specific antiserum detected a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa in many cells, including T lymphocytes and monocytes. VHX expression was not induced by T cell activation, but decreased somewhat at later time points. In vitro, VHX dephosphorylated the Erk2 mitogen-activated protein kinase with faster kinetics than did VHR, which is thought to be specific for Erk1 and 2. When expressed in Jurkat T cells, VHX had the capacity to suppress T cell antigen receptor-induced activation of Erk2 and of an NFAT/AP-1 luciferase reporter, but not an NF-κB reporter. Thus, VHX is a new member of the VH1/VHR group of small dual-specific phosphatases that act in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.

Phosphate is removed from phosphoproteins by two unrelated classes of protein phosphatases, the serine/threonine-specific phosphatases (PP1, PP2, etc.) and the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases; reviewed in 1,2). The latter group uses a cysteine-based catalytic mechanism (3Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 4Zhou G. Denu J.M., Wu, L.

Most DSPs are specific for mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk, Jnk, and p38, which are activated by dual phosphorylation of a tyrosine and threonine residue in the consensus motif Thr-X-Tyr.

Bryoles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A related enzyme was subsequently found in mammalian cells and termed VHR, for VH 1-related (11Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Kiki T. Aaronson S.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Both VH1 and VHR differ from other DSPs in that they are much smaller, only 19 and 21 kDa, respectively. VH1 has been reported to dephosphorylate both MAP kinases and Stat1 (12Najarro P. Traktman P. Lewis J.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), while VHR appears to be specific for Erk and Jnk (13Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the physiological function of VHR has remained somewhat unclear as it seems to be less efficient than many other MAP kinase-specific DSPs. We report the identification and initial characterization of a new human gene that encodes a DSP that is much more closely related to VH1 and VHR than to other DSPs. During our work, the nucleotide sequence and predicted open reading frame of this enzyme was deposited by others in GenBankTM under the name MKPX. However, this name is already occupied (15Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and cannot be used as such. Instead, we honor this name by proposing the acronym VHX for “VHR-related MKPX.” The 12CA5 anti-hemagglutinin mAb was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). The anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., (Lake Placid, NY) and the OKT3 hybridoma that produces the anti-CD3ε mAb was from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The mAb against CD28 was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). The polyclonal anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (Erk2) antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The cDNA for VHX was subcloned into the pGEX-4T1 vector and transformed into Escherichia coli strain XL-10. Expression of the GST-VHX protein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the protein purified over glutathione-SepharoseTM 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and used for immunization of two rabbits (HTI Inc., Ramona, CA). The resulting antiserum was purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized VHX (without GST). The catalytic activity of VHX was measured as described (16Tailor P. Williams S. Gilman J. Couture C. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5371-5376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The reaction was for 30 min at 37 °C in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 5 mm dithiothreitol with 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. The production ofp-nitrophenol was measured colorimetrically as absorbance at 405 nm. Purified His6-Erk2 (17Kholod N. Mustelin T. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was incubated with active Mek (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) in 20 mmMOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mmATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by dilution into ice-cold buffer without MgCl2 and ATP, but with 5 mm EDTA. Subsequently, 200-ng aliquots of phospho-Erk2 were mixed with VHX (cleaved from GST-VHX by thrombin) and incubated for 1–30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer, and the dephosphorylation of Erk2 analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Amplification of a 293-bp fragment of VHX cDNA was done with the 5′-upstream primer 5′-GAG CTG CCT TGT ACA CTG CCT GGC CGG GG-3′ and the 3′-downstream primer 5′-GGC CCA GAA CTT CAG AAT TCC TGG AGC GGC C-3′ from the Human MTCTMPanel II (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and Human Blood Fractions MTCTM Panel (CLONTECH) with TitaniumTM Taq polymerase (CLONTECH) as recommended by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's primers for G3PDH were used as recommended. The cDNA for VHX was also subcloned into the pEF/HA vector (18von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy-Bérard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which adds a hemagglutinin (HA) tag to the N terminus of the insert. To generate a catalytically inactive mutant of VHX, the codon for Cys-88 was changed into a codon for serine in the pGEX-VHX plasmid using the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit as recommended by the manufacturer (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The mutation was verified by nucleotide sequencing, and the cDNA subcloned into pEF/HA. Jurkat T leukemia and murine thymoma cells were kept at logarithmic growth in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and 100 units/ml each penicillin G and streptomycin. These cells were transiently transfected with a total of 5–15 μg of DNA by electroporation at 950 μF and 240 V (14Alonso A. Saxena S. Williams S. Mustelin T. J. Biol.

Cells were used for experiments 24 h after transfection. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (∼80% T cells) were obtained from venous blood from healthy donors (Red Cross Blood Bank, San Diego, CA), by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and removal of monocytes by adherence to plastic at 37 °C for 2 h. The adherent cells were also recovered. Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose filter, which were immunoblotted as before (19Couture C. Deckert M.

The final assay contained 50 μl of lysate plus 100 μl of ATP solution (10 mm ATP, 35 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 20 mmMgCl2) plus 100 μl of luciferin reagent (0.27 mm coenzyme A, 0.47 mm luciferin, 35 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 20 mmMgCl2). The activity was measured in an automatic luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI). The activity of a co-transfected β-galactosidase was measured and used to normalize the luciferase activity for transfection efficiency. To identify novel protein phosphatases, the Incyte data base was screened for open reading frames encoding proteins with homology to PTPases. One such cDNA encoded a 184-amino acid-residue polypeptide that had the canonical PTPase signature motif, His-Cys-X 5-Arg, at positions 87–94. In comparison with other PTPases, the new open reading frame had highest similarity to human VHR and the Vaccinia virus VH1 (Fig.1 A). Very recently, the same open-reading frame was deposited in GenBankTM under the (unpublished) name MKPX (accession number AF165519, gi9294744). However, since this name is already occupied by another unrelated DSP, MKP-X (15Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), also known as Pyst2 (15Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M.

Kling A. Ozanne B. Arkinstall A. Ashworth A. Genomics. 1997; 42: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we propose the name VHX for VHR-related MKPX for the new protein. This name honors the prior GenBankTM deposition by Gu and colleagues, but circumvents the confusing duplication of names. The name VHX also does not imply a function, which currently is unknown. To determine in which tissues and cell types VHX is expressed, we used a RT-PCR approach with gene-specific primers. An amplification product of the appropriate size (293 bp) was best obtained from Jurkat cells and thymus, while weaker bands were seen in spleen, prostate, testis, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (Fig. 1 B). The band from Jurkat was sequenced to verify that the correct cDNA fragment had been obtained. As a control, we amplified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Because of the lymphoid bias of the result, we repeated the RT-PCR with a lymphoid cell cDNA library panel (Fig. 1 B, right hand panels), which showed that monocytes, B lymphocytes, as well as CD4-positive and CD8-positive T cells express VHX. Interestingly, activated cells contained less VHX relative to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control than resting cells (compare lanes 3–7 with 8–11). A GST fusion protein containing the entire open reading frame of VHX was generated, purified, and used for immunization of two rabbits. The resulting antisera reacted well with HA-tagged VHX expressed in Jurkat or COS cells (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the prebleed serum from the same rabbit did not recognize this protein. As a control, the HA-tagged VHX was readily detected by the anti-HA mAb (Fig. 2 B). Immunoblotting of a number of cell lysates from human and murine leukemic cells lines detected an endogenous protein of the expected size, 19 kDa (Fig. 2 C). Jurkat T cells contained a very low level of VHX, while normal T cells from peripheral blood contained a stronger band (lane 4). COS-1 cells and MyoD6 myocytes also had VHX protein, while the murine thymoma LSTRA contained very little, if any, immunoreactive VHX (lane 5). Cell lysate samples containing 70 μg of protein from Jurkat cells, isolated blood T cells, and monocytes clearly showed that Jurkat cells have a very low level of VHX protein (Fig. 2 D) despite relatively abundant VHX mRNA (Fig. 1 B, lane 11). Since most DSPs are inducible genes encoded by immediate early genes, we wanted to determine whether this was also true for VHX. Normal blood T cells were treated with 5 μg/ml of the activating anti-CD3ε mAb OKT3 plus the anti-CD28 mAb for 0–48 h and then immunoblotted with the anti-VHX antibody. The amount of VHX immunoreactivity was not induced in these experiments, but rather showed a decline at the 24 and 48 h time points (Fig. 2 E), as also indicated by the lower presence of VHX mRNA in activated cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 8–11). Thus, VHR is constitutively expressed in resting T cells and is not induced. To gain some initial insight into the biology of VHX, we first generated a computer model of the protein by comparative modeling using the crystal structure of VHR (27Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) as a template. The model showed that the amino acid chain of VHX readily adopts the same mixed α-helical and β-sheet tertiary structure as VHR with Cys-88 in the bottom of the catalytic pocket. A GRASP representation of the model (Fig.3 A), showed that VHX presents a largely basic surface surrounding the catalytic center. In VHR the catalytic cleft is in a similarly basic groove, but bordered by an acidic ridge. In VHX, this ridge is missing. The Vacciniavirus VH1 also lacks the acidic ridge, and it shares a second basic patch with VHX. Based on this comparison, all three enzymes are likely to prefer substrates with acidic residues around the phosphotyrosine target residue, but VHX is likely to display a substrate preference more similar to that of VH1 than VHR. To formally demonstrate that VHX is a catalytically active phosphatase, we first measured its capacity to dephosphorylate the general PTPase substratep-nitrophenyl phosphate. This substrate was readily converted into the yellow p-nitrophenol by GST-VHX, but not by control GST, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A) and with a pH optimum of 7.0 (not shown). Thus, VHX is a catalytically active phosphatase. VHX belongs to the subgroup of dual-specific PTPases, many of which are specific for dually tyrosine and threonine phosphorylated MAP kinase family members. To directly test if VHX has phosphatase activity against the dual-phosphorylated Erk2 protein, we incubated purified Erk2 with GST-Mek and then treated the resulting phospho-Erk with GST-VHX. As shown in Fig. 3 C, 200 ng of VHX dephosphorylated 100 ng of Erk2 nearly completely within a few minutes at 37 °C. The same amount of VHR also dephosphorylated Erk2, but at a considerably slower rate. In contrast, the low molecular weight PTPase (LMPTP), an unrelated enzyme of similar size, did not dephosphorylate Erk2 (lanes 8 and 9). Control blots for Erk2 amount (Fig. 3 C, lower panel) also revealed that VHX caused a rapid shift of the apparent M r of Erk2 from 44 to 42 kDa, while VHR did not. This M r shift is caused by loss of phosphothreonine. To study this phenomenon better, we performed similar experiments that also included a shorter time point (Fig. 3, D and E), which showed that VHX caused appearance of the faster migrating Erk2 protein within 30 s and a complete conversion by 5 min. Again, VHR did not convert Erk2 to the lower M r form. Since endogenous VHX was present in T lymphocytes, we decided to test VHX for biological activity in T cell antigen receptor signaling pathways. For these experiments, we first co-expressed VHX with a Myc-tagged Erk2 and measured its activation in response to anti-CD3ε mAbs. As shown in Fig.4 A, Erk2 activation was severely reduced by VHX, but not by another PTPase (PRL-2), which was expressed at higher levels than VHX (lower panel). At the shown 5-min time point, the inhibition was 42%, and in time-course experiments the inhibition was similar (40–60%) at all time points (1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 min). Next, we co-expressed VHX with a sensitive luciferase reporter gene, in which luciferase transcription is under the control of a tandem NFAT/AP-1 element taken from the interleukin-2 gene promoter. This reporter responds to T cell antigen receptor ligation with anti-CD3ε mAbs alone or together with co-ligation of the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule (14Alonso A. Saxena S. Williams S. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). VHX inhibited the response in a dose-dependent manner with 50% inhibition at 0.5–1 μg of plasmid (Fig. 4 B). The expression of VHX protein correlated with DNA dose (insert). In contrast to the effect of catalytically active VHX, expression of the catalytically inactive VHX-C88S mutant did not inhibit reporter gene activation (Fig.4 C), suggesting that the catalytic activity of VHX was required for inhibition. The C88S mutant protein was expressed at the same level as the wild-type VHX (insert). We next tested VHX for effects in a parallel signaling pathway emanating from the T cell antigen receptor and the CD28 co-receptor, namely the activation of NF-κB-driven transcription. In these experiments, VHX failed to have any significant effects over the same 0.5–10-μg range as used in the NFAT/AP-1 experiments (Fig.4 D). Only at the highest concentration (10 μg) was there a slight reduction in the reporter gene response, which is unlikely of any significance. We conclude that VHX does not affect signaling pathways required for NF-κB activation in T cells. To determine where in the cell VHX is located, we first transfected Jurkat T cells with the VHX expression plasmid and stained them with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-HA mAb. When these cells were viewed under a confocal microscope, it was clear that most of the fluorescence was in the cytoplasm of the cells (Fig.5, B and C). Cells transfected with empty vector did not display any fluorescence at all (Fig. 5 A). To verify that this subcellular location was also true for endogenous VHX, we stained blood T lymphocytes with preimmune serum (Fig. 5 D) or the affinity-purified anti-VHX plus TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Fig. 5, E andF). With this staining protocol, the immunofluorescence was also cytoplasmic. We conclude that VHX is not nuclear like many DSPs, but cytoplasmic. In this paper, we describe and begin the characterization of a novel DSP, VHX, which is related to Vaccinia VH1 and the human VHR. Although, the three enzymes are quite similar in size and share amino acid similarity, they also differ in many significant respects. First, VHX has a longer C-terminal tail, in which there is a possible tyrosine phosphorylation site. Second, VHX has a different expression profile than VHR. VHX is expressed best in the thymus, which is lowest in VHR (14Alonso A. Saxena S. Williams S. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Neither enzyme is induced, but VHX decreases at 24 and 48 h of T cell activation, while VHR remains unchanged (14Alonso A. Saxena S. Williams S. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Third, VHX differs from VHR in that it is much more efficient toward dually phosphorylated Erk2. In contrast to VHR, which dephosphorylates phosphotyrosine much faster than phosphothreonine (28Denu J.M. Zhou G., Wu, L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), VHX appears to readily dephosphorylate Thr-183 in Erk2, as well as Tyr-185. Thus, the apparent M r of Erk2, as seen by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, shifts from 44 to 42 kDa within the first minutes of co-incubation before it disappears. VHR, on the other hand, maintains Erk2 as a 44-kDa band that gradually weakens. Thus, VHX is a bona fide DSP, while VHR has evolved toward a more tyrosine-selective catalytic activity. The group of small DSPs defined by VHR and VHX differs from the MKPs that constitute the majority of DSPs, in that they lack obvious non-catalytic targeting or regulatory motifs. This explains their much smaller molecular mass, only 21 and 19 kDa, respectively, compared with over 40 kDa for most MKPs. Nevertheless, two recent papers (14Alonso A. Saxena S. Williams S. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Todd J. Tanner K. Dent J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 19: 13271-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (146) Google Scholar) suggested that the Erk1 and Erk2 kinases are physiological targets for VHR. We also found that activation of Jnk in intact T cells was diminished by co-expression of VHR, while the catalytically inactive VHR-C124S had little effect (14Alonso A. Saxena S. Williams S. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast to Erk and Jnk, activation of p38 kinase was not affected by VHR (14Alonso A. Saxena S. Williams S. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Todd J. Tanner K. Dent J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 19: 13271-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, if VHR dephosphorylates MAP kinases in cells that normally express many other, and more efficient, MKPs. In this report, we compared the new enzyme VHX with VHR and found that VHX is considerably more efficient as a Erk phosphatase and also removes phosphate from Thr-183 as well as from Tyr-185. Transfected VHX also inhibits activation of Erk2 in Jurkat T cells. Nevertheless, the physiological substrate(s) for VHX in intact cells remains to be established. Our results with reporter genes suggest that VHX can dephosphorylate a protein that is involved in T cell antigen receptor-mediated activation of gene transcription driven by a NFAT/AP-1 module, but not in pathways to NF-κB driven transcription. This result is also compatible with Erk2 being a target, but since all three types of MAP kinases (Erk, Jnk, and p38) are activated by the T cell antigen receptor and participate in activation of components of AP-1, it is premature to conclude that Erk2 is the only substrate. This is under further investigation in our laboratory."

Correct targeting of nuclear-encoded proteins within the eukaryotic cell is essential for its function and for the biogenesis of the individual organelles. Most proteins destined for chloroplasts and mitochondria are synthesized as precursors with N-terminal extensions that serve as transit peptides to direct the precursors to receptors on the outer membranes of the organelles. These receptors are part of the so-called Toc or Tom complexes (for translocase ofouter chloroplast or mitochondrial membrane). These interact with the Tic or Tim complexes (fortranslocase of inner chloroplast ormitochondrial membrane) to effect translocation of the precursor into the organelle, and then the transit peptide is cleaved by a processing peptidase (for reviews see Refs. 1Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar and 2Braun H.P. Schmitz U.K. Planta. 1999; 209: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Analysis of the transit peptides for chloroplast and mitochondrial precursors has revealed that there is little conservation at the primary sequence level either in composition or in length, although some general features have been identified (3von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 4von Heijne G. Nishikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Chloroplast transit peptides have few acidic residues and are rich in hydroxylated residues; plant mitochondrial presequences share these characteristics but also frequently form amphipathic α-helices, with positive charges clustered on one side (5Whelan J. Glaser E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 771-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This characteristic is important for targeting into fungal mitochondria (6Roise D. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although less is known about its importance for targeting to plant mitochondria. Nevertheless, it is generally considered that the transit peptides are specific for their respective organelles and that the receptor machinery on the outer membranes of chloroplasts and mitochondria is able to discriminate between bona fide precursors and those of the other organelle.

In contrast, there have been recent reports of proteins that appear to be dual-targeted to both organelles. Creissen et al. (10Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y.B. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) showed that expression of one of the isoforms of pea glutathione reductase (GR; EC 1.6.4.2) in transgenic tobacco resulted in targeting of the enzyme to both chloroplasts and mitochondria. Furthermore, the transit peptide alone was able to dual-target a bacterial phosphinothricin acetyltransferase protein in vivo. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the precursor for one isoform of ferrochelatase (pre-ferrochelatase-I), the terminal enzyme of heme biosynthesis, was found to be imported into both pea chloroplasts and mitochondria (11Chow K.S. Singh D.P. Roper J.M. Smith A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27565-27571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although pre-ferrochelatase-II was imported into chloroplasts only (12Chow K.S. Singh D.P. Walker A.R. Smith A.G. Plant J. 1998; 15: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similarly, the precursors for a number of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (RSs) from Arabidopsis have been shown to be dual-targeted. Transit peptides for methionyl-RS (13Menand B. Marechal-Drouard L.

To investigate this phenomenon of dual-targeting further, our goal was to determine whether there were different domains in the transit peptide of GR from pea that were important for targeting to each organelle. In particular, we wanted to determine whether removal of the positively charged residues reduced the import of precursor protein into isolated mitochondria, as would be expected by comparison with fungal mitochondrial transit peptides (6Roise D. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the removal of positively charged residues has been shown to decrease the import efficiency to mitochondria in vitro(16Chu T.W. Grant P.M. Strauss A.W. J. Biol.

During our investigation, we carried out import of an extensive range of different precursor proteins into both isolated pea mitochondria and chloroplasts.

The plasmid encoding the AtCPOleader-GFP fusion protein was made by subcloning the coding region from pAtCI1d-GFP.UC118 (see “Experimental Procedures”) into pGEM-4Zf. The synthesis of transcripts in vitro was carried out using the Riboprobe® Systems from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions but with some minor changes. Transcription of mRNA from a plasmid template was carried out in 1× transcription buffer (supplied by Promega Corp.) with the addition of 40 units of RNasin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmATP, 1 mm CTP, 0.8 mm GTP, 1 mmUTP, 0.5 mm m7G Cap analog, and 20 units of RNA polymerase. The mixture was incubated for an initial 30 min at 37 °C. After the 30-min preincubation, GTP was added to a final concentration of 0.7 mm, and the mixture was incubated for another 30 min. The transcription mixture was extracted with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform (1:1), before being precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 100% v/v ethanol in the presence of 0.5 volume of 7.5m ammonium acetate. Translation of the transcripts was carried out in 50% v/v rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 0.05 mm amino acid mixture (minus methionine and cysteine), 40 units of RNasin, and 11 μCi of PRO-MixTMl-[35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Biosciences). The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h to allow translation to take place. The resultant radiolabeled proteins were used immediately for import assays. Chloroplasts were isolated from 7- to 8-day-old peas as described (20Mould R.M. Gray J.C. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press San Diego, CA1998: 81-86Google Scholar), and mitochondria were isolated from 10- to 12-day-old peas as described (11Chow K.S. Singh D.P. Roper J.M. Smith A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27565-27571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with some minor changes. Instead of two washes, the isolated mitochondria were washed once with RM-I buffer before finally being resuspended in 0.4 ml of RM-I buffer. Mitochondrial import reactions contained 50 μg of protein in a 200-μl reaction. The import assay into isolated mitochondria was adapted from Ref. 11Chow K.S. Singh D.P. Roper J.M. Smith A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27565-27571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar. The incubation buffer also contained 10 mm malate, 5 mmmethionine, 5 mm cysteine, 5 mm ATP, and 20 μm ADP. Freshly isolated mitochondria, equivalent to 100–200 μg of protein, were resuspended in import buffer, and then 9% v/v translation products were added. The assay was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 25 °C. At the end of incubation, the import mixture was diluted if required with RM-I buffer before being divided into two equal portions. One portion was directly layered onto a 20% w/v sucrose cushion, and mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation at top speed for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The other half was treated with 200 μg/ml proteinase K, incubated at 4 °C for 40 min, followed by the addition of 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to terminate the activity of the protease. The mitochondria were then reisolated as above. The mitochondria of both protease-treated and -untreated portions were washed once with 1 ml of RM-I buffer before lysing them in 20 mm TES-NaOH, pH 7.2. The lysed mitochondria were dissolved in 1× SDS loading buffer and then stored at −70 °C until analysis. When used, 10 μm valinomycin was added to the mitochondria prior to addition of the translation product. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described (11Chow K.S. Singh D.P. Roper J.M. Smith A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27565-27571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The protocols for assaying the import of precursors into isolated chloroplasts were essentially the same as those described previously (21Mould R.M. Gray J.C. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 286-292Google Scholar) with some modifications. In the import buffer, 6–9% v/v translation products were used instead of 5%, and at the end of the reaction, 5 mm cysteine was added as well as unlabeled methionine. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min instead of 40 min under continuous illumination. After import, the chloroplasts were fractionated as described. A serial dilution of mitochondrion and chloroplast preparations was set up, starting with 1 mg·ml−1 protein and diluting 2-fold to a final concentration of 0.008 mg·ml−1 protein. A 20-μl aliquot of each dilution was electrophoresed on 17% (v/v) SDS-acrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose prior to blocking overnight in 10% Marvel milk in 0.1% PBST. Blots were then probed with an antibody raised against the 23K protein of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem two (1:1000 dilution in 0.1% PBST) or against the F1β-subunit of the mitochondrial ATPase (1:500 dilution in 0.1% PBST) according to the protocol ECL-Western blotting available on the internet at www.biol.rug.nl/lacto/protocols/westernecl.html. The secondary antibody used was anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10000 dilution in 0.1% PBST), and the bands were detected using chemiluminescence. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was measured using a method based on the protocol of Wu and Racker (22Wu R. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1029-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in an assay containing 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.9; 0.25 mm NADPH; 9 mm MgCl2; 3 mm ATP; 25 units of phosphoglycerate phosphokinase (EC2.7.2.3); 5 mm 3-phosphoglycerate. The change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured at 25 °C for 5 min. The cytochromec oxidase assay was modified from the protocol of Tolbert (23Tolbert N.E. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c was reduced by adding sodium dithionite until the ratio of the absorbances at 550 and 565 nm was equal to 10 ± 0.5. The assay mix consisted of 250 μg·ml−1reduced cytochrome c, 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, and 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100. The initial change in absorbance was measured at 550 nm and 25 °C. The concentration of chlorophyll was determined using the protocol of Arnon (24Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs encoding the full-length protein coding sequence for CPO (CPOfull) or the first 92 amino acids (CPOleader) were generated by PCR amplification from the full-length cDNA encoding CPO-I from Arabidopsis (3535. Santana, M. A., Tan, F.-C. & Smith, A. G. (2002) Plant Physiol. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar), using as forward primer AtCPO-I.fwd (5′-ATAGGATCCATGGCTTCTCACTCGTCG-3′) and either AtCPO-I.rev2 (5′-ATAGGATCCCGATCCACTCCTTCGGGTTG-3′) or AtCPO-I.tprev (5′-TATGGATCCCTTGAGCAGCCCTAATCATAG-3′), respectively. The PCR products were cloned into the BamHI sites in psmRSGFP (25Davis S.J. Vierstra R.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) to generate fusions to the coding sequence for solubility-modified, red-shifted green fluorescent protein, under the regulation of the CaMV35S promoter and the nopaline synthase terminator. The fidelity of PCR amplification and the fusion junctions were checked by sequencing. The plasmids were named pAtCIf-GFP.UC118 and pAtCIld-GFP.UC118. A construct encoding the transit peptide of the dual-targetedArabidopsis histidyl-tRS fused to GFP (14; a gift from Dr Ian Small, INRA, Evry, France) was used as a control. The constructs were introduced into tobacco leaf guard cells via particle bombardment using a PDS-1000/He System (Bio-Rad). Young tobacco leaves were placed on a piece of wetted Whatman filter paper in a 9-cm Petri dish. The leaves were then bombarded with DNA-coated M-10 tungsten particles (Bio-Rad) at a target distance of 9 cm. The tungsten particles were delivered at a helium pressure of 1,350 pounds/square inch and a chamber vacuum of 28 inches of mercury. The bombarded tissues were incubated under constant white light for about 16–18 h before being analyzed under a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope. An argon ion laser line of 488 nm was used to excite both the GFP fluorophore and the chlorophyll. The emission spectra of the excited GFP and the chlorophyll autofluorescence were collected between 500 and 515 nm (fluorescein isothiocyanate settings) and 630–670 nm (tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate settings), respectively, in two separate channels. The recorded digital images were then imported and graphically enhanced using the Adobe® Photoshop®5.5 program. Positively charged arginine residues at positions 20, 33, and 54 in the GR presequence were changed to alanine using a method based on the inverse PCR protocol outlined in Hemsley et al. (26Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To change the GRPAT lysine residue at position 27 to alanine, in vitrosite-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) andEpicurian coli (L.) XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). Previous studies (10Creissen G. Reynolds H. Xue Y.B. Mullineaux P. Plant J. 1995; 8: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) had shown that pea GR is targeted to both chloroplasts and mitochondria in vivo, and the original objective of this study was to characterize further this process using in vitro assays for the import of proteins by isolated chloroplasts and mitochondria. A principal aim was to test the importance of an amphipathic helix for the mitochondrial targeting process. The presequence for pea GR is in general more characteristic of chloroplast-targeted proteins than those of mitochondria, being relatively long (about 60 residues), and enriched in hydroxylated amino acids. However, the helical wheel projection shown in Fig.1 indicates that two short amphipathic regions can form, if the presequence adopts a helical structure. The precursor of GR (pGR) was synthesized in vitro by transcription of a cDNA clone (TableI) followed by translation in a reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine. The precursor was then incubated with isolated pea chloroplasts (Fig.2, left-hand panels). It can be seen that the 62-kDa precursor protein is imported and processed to the predicted size of the mature protein (54 kDa) and that it is located almost exclusively in the stroma, which is consistent with the observation that the enzyme activity is soluble (27Edwards E.A. Rawsthorne S. Mullineaux P.M. Planta. 1990; 180: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The precursor is also imported and processed by isolated pea mitochondria (Fig. 2,right-hand panels), as expected given the in vivodata described above. As positive controls for the import reactions, we incubated the organelles with precursors to the mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX (28Whelan J. Hugosson M. Glaser E. Day D.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)) and the major light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein (Lhcb1 (29Cline K. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) of the chloroplast thylakoid membrane. As expected, the 36-kDa precursor of AOX (pAOX) was found to be imported only into mitochondria, whereas the 30-kDa pLhcb1 was targeted only into chloroplasts (Fig. 2). This indicates that our organelle preparations do not contain significant contamination of the other organelle, an observation supported by other studies (see below). Whereas the AOX and Lhcb1 precursors are often used as substrates for mitochondrial/chloroplast import assays, we also analyzed other precursor proteins as controls for the import, principally to check for cross-contamination of the purified chloroplast preparations with mitochondria and vice versa. The substrates used were the 33-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex (33K (30James H.E. Bartling D. Musgrove J.E. Kirwin P.M. Herrmann R.G. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19573-19576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), plastocyanin (PC), Hcf136, a protein involved in the assembly of Photosystem II (32Meurer J. Plucken H. Kowallik K.V. Westhoff P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5286-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis enzyme CPO, which is located in the chloroplast stroma (33Smith A.G. Marsh O. Elder G.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 34Kruse E. Mock H.P. Grimm B. Planta. 1995; 196: 796-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3535. Santana, M. A., Tan, F.-C. & Smith, A. G. (2002) Plant Physiol. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). The origin of the cDNAs and the constructs used to generate radiolabeled precursor proteins for each of these are listed in TableI. Fig. 3 shows that, as expected, all four proteins are imported into chloroplasts (left-hand panels), processed to the mature size, and targeted correctly within the organelle. 33K, Hcf136, and plastocyanin are thylakoid lumen proteins and are hence found primarily in the thylakoid fraction (lanes T), although the stromal intermediate of Hcf136 is also apparent (int). CPO is targeted into the stroma (lane S). However, quite unexpectedly, all four precursors were also imported into isolated pea mitochondria (Fig. 3, right-hand panels). p33K is imported and processed by the mitochondria to an intermediate size product (33K*) that runs as a 35-kDa protein. pHcf136 is converted to two products of similar sizes to those found in chloroplasts, and pCPO is processed to a protein of similar size (denoted CPO*) to the mature protein generated by chloroplasts. Pre-plastocyanin is readily imported by mitochondria and processed exclusively to an intermediate size band (PC*) that runs almost exactly between the precursor and mature size PC proteins (not shown). Several points can be drawn from these and other data. First, these chloroplast proteins are imported by the pea mitochondria with the same efficiency as into chloroplasts. Second, we have found other chloroplast proteins are also imported by isolated mitochondria, including glutathione peroxidase (36Mullineaux P.M. Karpinski S. Jimenez A. Cleary S.P. Robinson C. Creissen G.P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and the 23-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex (data not shown). This means that several different chloroplast proteins, including stromal, extrinsic thylakoid, and thylakoid lumen proteins, can be imported by plant mitochondria. Finally, although most of the experiments were carried out using mitochondria from pea leaves, similar import characteristics were observed for mitochondria isolated from maize leaves and potato tubers. 2K.-S. Chow and A. G. Smith, unpublished observation. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that several chloroplast precursor proteins are not imported into mitochondria, including porphobilinogen deaminase (11Chow K.S"
https://openalex.org/W2070342926,"We reported previously that normal Huntingtin is associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF) signaling complex (Liu, Y. F., Deth, C. R., and Devys, D. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 8121–8124). To investigate the potential role of normal and polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin in the regulation of growth factor receptor-mediated cellular signaling and biological function, we stably transfected full-length Huntingtin containing 16, 48, or 89 polyglutamine repeats into PC12 cells where cellular signaling mechanisms, mediated by nerve growth factor (NGF) or EGF receptors, are well characterized. Expression of polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin, but not normal Huntingtin, leads to a dramatic morphological change. In clones carrying the mutated Huntingtin, both NGF and EGF receptor-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and Akt are significantly attenuated, and NGF receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth is blocked. Co-immunoprecipitation studies show that the associations of NGF or EGF receptors with growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase are significantly inhibited. NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NGF receptors (TrkA) is also consistently suppressed. Our data demonstrate that polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin disrupts cellular signaling mediated by both EGF and NGF receptors in PC12 cells. It is known that Huntington's disease patients exhibit an extremely low incidence of a variety of cancers and are deficient in glucose metabolism.

The HD gene encodes a 350-kDa protein designated as Huntingtin (3The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research GroupCell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7118) Google Scholar), which is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues (4Gutekunst C.-A.

In neurons, Huntingtin is richly found in dendrites and nerve terminals where Huntingtin is associated with synaptic vesicles and microtubule complexes (4Gutekunst C.-A. Levey A.I. Heilman C.J.

Huntington's disease nerve growth factor epidermal growth factor mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase protein kinase B growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 phosphoinositide-3 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Although the pathogenesis of HD remains to be investigated further, it is likely that polyglutamine expansion causes dysfunction of Huntingtin and results in HD. The loss of function of normal Huntingtin may therefore play a significant role in the pathogenesis of HD (8Cattaneo E. Rigamonti D. Goffredo D. Zuccato C. Squitieri F. Sipione S. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Because Huntingtin is a ubiquitously expressed protein, one would expect dysfunction of Huntingtin might cause pathological changes in all tissues where Huntingtin is found. Although clinically HD is mainly manifested as a neurodegenerative disease, systematic symptoms are very common and are often overlooked. For example, deficiency in glucose utilization and metabolism and extremely low incidence of malignant tumors are commonly found in most, if not all, HD patients (9Grafton S.T. Mazziotta J.C. Pahl J.J., St George-Hyslop P. Haines J.L. Gusella J. Hoffman J.M. Baxter L.R. Phelps M.E. Arch. Neurol. 1992; 49: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Kuwert T. Lange H.W.

Cancer (Phila.). 1999; 86: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These systematic changes in HD patients, like changes in the central nervous system, also reflect dysfunction of Huntingtin as the result of its polyglutamine expansion. In our previous studies, we observed that normal Huntingtin is associated with the SH3 domains of Grb2 and Ras GTPase-activating protein, and these associations are highly regulated by activation of EGF receptors (1Liu Y.F. Deth C.R. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) which suggests that normal Huntingtin may play a role in the regulation of cellular signaling mediated by EGF receptors. Because both glucose metabolism and cell proliferation are highly regulated by growth factor receptors (12Pawson T. Saxton T.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 675-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that polyglutamine expansion may interfere with normal Huntingtin to regulate growth factor receptor-mediated cellular signaling and biological functions thereby leading to inhibition of glucose metabolism and cell proliferation. To investigate the role of normal or polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin in the regulation of cellular signaling and function mediated by growth factor receptors, we stably transfected full-length Huntingtin containing 16, 48, or 89 polyglutamine repeats into PC12 cells. We report that expression of polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin leads to disruption of cellular signaling and biological function mediated by both EGF and NGF receptors. PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum (full DMEM). Different full-length Huntingtin constructs containing 16, 48, or 89 CAG repeats (13Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) were separately co-transfected with PY-3, a plasmid containing the hygromycin B-resistant gene, into PC12 cells using Lipofectin as per instructions by the manufacturer. Multiple 16F, 48F, or 89F clones were selected using full DMEM containing 250 μg/ml hygromycin B. These selected PC12 clones were maintained in full DMEM containing 150 μg/ml hygromycin B. Two to 3 days prior to the experiments, multiple 16F, 48F, or 89F clones were cultured in regular DMEM without hygromycin B to remove inhibition of protein synthesis by the antibiotic. Wild-type PC12 cells and multiple 16F, 48F, or 89F clones were serum-starved for 18–24 h. Cells were treated with NGF (10 ng/ml) for 15 min or EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C and then lysed with 1% Triton X-100 buffer (13Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (30 μg of protein) were resolved in a 10% SDS gel and transferred. The blots were analyzed by an anti-phospho-MAPK, anti-phospho-JNK, or anti-phospho-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling) to detect activated MAPK, JNK, or Akt. The blots were then stripped and re-probed with an anti-MAPK, anti-JNK, or anti-Akt antibody to detect total MAPK, JNK, or Akt. Two to 3 days prior to experimentations, hygromycin B was removed from culture medium. Wild-type PC12 cells or multiple 16F, 48F, or 89F clones were serum-starved for 18–24 h. Cells were stimulated with NGF (10 ng/ml) for 15 min or EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C and then lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (15Sun Y. Savinainen A. Reddy P.H. Liu Y.F. J. Biol.

Cell lysates were incubated with an anti-Grb2 or anti-p85 antibody for 3 h at 4 °C, and a mixture of protein A- and G-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added. Incubation was continued for another 1 h. Precipitated proteins were resolved in an SDS gel and transferred. The blots were analyzed by an anti-TrkA antibody. Full-length Huntingtin expression vector containing 16, 48, or 89 CAG repeats was stably transfected into PC12 cells. The positive clones were identified by Western blot analysis using 437, an anti-Huntingtin antibody that has been characterized previously (1Liu Y.F. Deth C.R. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, in clones carrying mutated Huntingtin constructs with either 48 or 89 CAG repeats (48F or 89F clones), the amount of expressed mutated Huntingtin is about equivalent to the amount of endogenously expressed Huntingtin in PC12 cells. In clones carrying normal Huntingtin construct with 16 CAG repeats, the amount of Huntingtin is about doubled (Fig. 1 A). To avoid variations of different PC12 subclones, all experiments were simultaneously conducted with two different clones carrying the same construct, and the results were further verified using another subclone. Because the results are similar, we only present data from one or two clones; and the data from other clones are mentioned in the figure legends. Expression of full-length normal Huntingtin with 16 polyglutamine repeats (16F clones) did not alter the morphology of PC12 cells. Expression of full-length mutated Huntingtin with either 48 or 89 polyglutamine repeats (48F or 89F clones) led to a significant morphological change. As shown in Fig. 1 B, both 48F-22 and 89F-21 clones exhibit epithelial-like morphology. They were well attached to the plate and therefore look much bigger than PC12 or 16F-1 cells. They also proliferated much faster, and the doubling time was about one-third that of wild-type PC12 cells. It is known that in PC12 cells, stimulation of NGF and EGF receptors causes activation of MAPK, JNK, and Akt (17Ashcroft M Stephens R.M. Hallberg B. Downward J. Kaplan D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4586-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18977-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We next examined whether expression of full-length normal or polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin affects NGF- or EGF-induced activation of these kinases. In wild-type PC12 cells stimulation with NGF or EGF led to an elevation of MAPK activity (Fig. 2 A). In 16F-1 clones, stimulation with NGF or EGF also increased MAPK activation that was comparable with that in PC12 cells (Fig.2 A). In multiple 48F and 89F clones, NGF- or EGF-induced MAPK activity was reduced by 85–95%. This inhibition was not due to down-regulation of total MAPK because the amount of total MAPK in either 48F or 89F clones was similar to that in PC12 cells (Fig.2 A). Similarly, expression of normal Huntingtin did not alter JNK activation induced by NGF or EGF, although expression of the mutated Huntingtin with either 48 or 89 polyglutamine repeats significantly inhibited JNK activation. As shown in Fig. 2 B, JNK activity induced by NGF or EGF was reduced by 80–90% in multiple 48F or 89F clones. Decrease in total JNK may partially account for inhibition of JNK activation by the mutated Huntingtin because total JNK was reduced by ∼30% in these 48F and 89F clones (Fig.2 B). In PC12 cells, stimulation with NGF or EGF caused an ∼10-fold increase of Akt activity (Fig. 2 C). In 16F-1 clones carrying normal Huntingtin, the basal level of Akt was increased by 2–3-fold and stimulation with NGF or EGF further increased Akt activity (Fig. 2 C). In multiple 48F and 89F clones NGF- or EGF-induced Akt activation was significantly attenuated or nearly completely blocked (Fig. 2 C). This inhibition of Akt activation by the mutated Huntingtin is not the result of a decrease of total Akt because the level of total Akt in these 48F or 89F clones is similar to that in PC12 cells. In PC12 cells stimulation with NGF leads to activation and auto-phosphorylation of TrkA which, in turn, interacts with Src homology collagen-Grb2 and leads to activation of the Ras-dependent signaling pathway and p85 of PI 3-kinase and resultant activation of the Akt and Rac-JNK signaling pathways (17Ashcroft M Stephens R.M. Hallberg B. Downward J. Kaplan D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4586-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To explore molecular mechanisms by which polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin inhibits activation of MAPK, JNK, and Akt mediated by NGF or EGF receptors, we examined the association of Grb2 or p85 of PI 3-kinase with TrkA by co-immunoprecipitation. Stimulation with NGF significantly increased the association of GRB2 (Fig. 3 A) and p85 (Fig.3 B) with TrkA in both PC12 cells and 16F-1 clones. In 48F-22 clones, the association of Grb2 or p85 with TrkA is significantly inhibited. This may explain why, in 48F clones, NGF-induced activation of MAPK, JNK, or Akt is suppressed. To explore why the mutated Huntingtin inhibits assembly of the TrkA signaling complexes, we examined whether stimulation with NGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA. As shown in Fig. 3 C, NGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA in both PC12 and 16F-1 cells. In both 48F and 89F clones TrkA remains tyrosine-phosphorylated after serum starvation for 24 h. Stimulation with NGF did not cause a significant increase of the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated TrkA (Fig.3 C). We also examined the potential association of Huntingtin with TrkA by co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig.3 D, in both PC12 and 16F clones, normal Huntingtin was detectable in TrkA immunoprecipitates. In 48F and 89F clones, both normal and polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin was not present in TrkA immunoprecipitates, suggesting that the mutated Huntingtin may act as a dominant negative mutant and inhibit normal Huntingtin to interact with TrkA signaling complex. These data are consistent with our previous observations that normal Huntingtin inhibits the mutated Huntingtin to bind to PSD-95 (16Savinainen A. Garcia E.P. Dorow D. Marshall J. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11382-11386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the dominant inherited phenotype of the disease. It is known that activation of TrkA by NGF in PC12 cells induces neuronal differentiation (18Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18977-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 19Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), so we next examined how expression of normal or polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin influences NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. As shown in Fig. 4, treatment of PC12 cells with NGF for 4 days resulted in neurite outgrowth. In 16F clones treatment of NGF also induced neurites outgrowth, but the number of these neurites are fewer, and the length of these neurites are shorter. In both 48F and 89F clones, NGF failed to stop switch these cells from proliferation to neuronal differentiation, and both 48F and 89F cells appeared to be overgrown after 4 days (Fig. 4, middle panel). We separately plated 48F and 89F cells in a very low density. Again, both 48F and 89F clones failed to differentiate in the presence of NGF (Fig. 4, lower panel). These data are consistent with inhibition of NGF-induced activation of MAPK and Akt in these clones which, in turn, mediate neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (18Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18977-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 19Yasui H. Katoh H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15298-15305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that expression of full-length polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin, but not normal Huntingtin, disrupts cellular signaling mediated by NGF and EGF receptors in PC12 cells. NGF-induced neuronal differentiation was also blocked. Further studies show that the mutated Huntingtin may, constitutively, cause activation of these growth factor receptors and inhibit assembly of the receptor-associated signaling complex. These interesting phenotypes are not due to overexpression of the mutated Huntingtin because the level of expressed mutated proteins is equal to the level of endogenously expressed Huntingtin. In other words, these clones are “heterozygous” cells of HD. Also, these changes do not result from variation of different subclones of PC12 because we observed similar phenotypes in three different clones carrying the same gene. Because the only difference between 16F clones and 48F or 89F clones is the length of the polyglutamine repeat, these distinct phenotypes, observed in both 48F or 89F clones, are due to expansion of the polyglutamine repeat in Huntingtin. Although some studies have suggested that a significantly lower incidence of a variety of cancers among HD patients may result from an apoptotic effect of polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin (11Sorensen S.A. Fenger K. Olsen J.H. Cancer (Phila.). 1999; 86: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), many studies have shown that mutated Huntingtin selectively induces apoptotic cell death of certain types of neurons; and many cells, including some neuronal cells, are resistant to toxicity mediated by the mutated protein (13Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Hackam A.S. Singaraja R. Wellington C.L. Metzler M. McCutcheon K. Zhang T. Kalchman M. Hayden M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 21Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Because the lower incidence of cancer in HD patients is not restricted in one to two types of cancer but almost all cancer types investigated (11Sorensen S.A. Fenger K. Olsen J.H. Cancer (Phila.). 1999; 86: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it is very likely that a more general mechanism that regulates cell proliferation is involved. Without question, growth factor receptor-mediated cellular signaling, particularly the Ras-MAPK pathway, provides the most important and general mechanism for the regulation of cell proliferation in a mammalian system. Assembly of Grb2-signaling complexes is required for activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway mediated by many growth factor receptors (22Pawson T. Hunter T. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin interferes with both NGF and EGF receptors and the inhibition occurs at assembly of signaling complexes associated with these activated receptors, it is possible that the mutated Huntingtin may also inhibit cellular signaling mediated by other receptors. If mutated Huntingtin attenuates cellular signaling, cell proliferation mediated by growth factor receptors would be inhibited as supported by our observation that NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth is blocked in both 48F and 89F clones. Consequently, one would expect that the occurrence of a diversity of cancer might be reduced. Although 48F and 89F clones proliferate faster than PC12 cells and 16F clones, this change is very likely due to the fact that these cells attach much better to the plate than both PC12 and 16F cells, and cell attachment is an important factor to control the growth rate of cultured cells (23Sheppard D. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The PI-3-Akt pathway plays a critical role in controlling glucose metabolism mediated by insulin (24Hajduch E. Litherland G.J. Hundal H.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 16: 199-203Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Although the current study did not directly examine effects on insulin receptors, it is generally believed that the PI 3-kinase pathway is common to many growth factor receptors (25Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Our observations, therefore, may signify an effect on insulin-mediated glucose metabolism. Deficiency in glucose metabolism is widely reported (9Grafton S.T. Mazziotta J.C. Pahl J.J., St George-Hyslop P. Haines J.L. Gusella J. Hoffman J.M. Baxter L.R. Phelps M.E. Arch.

Brain. 1990; 113: 1405-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) in HD patients, and all HD patients lose a considerable amount of body weight which cannot be explained by other clinical manifestations of HD (26Kremer H.P. Roos R.A. Arch. Neurol. 1992; 49: 349Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the PI-3-Akt pathway would explain why glucose utilization and fat storage are inhibited in HD patients; however, further studies are needed to evaluate whether the mutated Huntingtin affects cellular signaling and function mediated by the insulin receptor family. Akt is also an important survival signal in neurons (27Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar), and it is well known that inhibition of Akt activation promotes neuronal death (14Liu Y.F. Dorow D. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of the PI-3-Akt pathway may represent an important pathological change in HD and also requires further examination. Huntingtin is a ubiquitously expressed protein (4Gutekunst C.-A. Levey A.I. Heilman C.J. Whaley W.L., Yi, H. Nash N.R. Rees H.D. Madden J.J. Hersch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 5Trottier Y.

Genet. 1995; 10: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and dysfunction of Huntingtin may not only cause pathological changes in the central nervous system but may also result in changes in peripheral tissues. Because most peripheral tissues are capable of regeneration, degenerative features may only be found in the central nervous system. To understand the pathogenesis of HD, one has to investigate how polyglutamine expansion affects the normal function of Huntingtin. In our current study, we demonstrate that polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin inhibits growth factor receptor-mediated cellular signaling and biological function. Because these actions are highly related to many clinical manifestations in HD, our data may reflect an important molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HD. We thank Dr. S. Lloyd for generous support. We also thank Drs. S. Grate and T. Gibbs for critical reading and helpful comments on this manuscript."

These enzymes are involved in many important biological processes, such as the biosynthesis of cholesterol or the degradation of xenobiotics in mammals and in nature (4Hines R.N. Cashman J.R.

HbpA was first found in Pseudomonas azelaica HBP1, a soil bacterium that is able to grow on the fungicide 2-hydroxybiphenyl as sole source of carbon and energy (7Kohler H.-P.E. Kohler-Staub D. Focht D.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2683-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HbpA catalyzes theortho-hydroxylation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl to 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, which is then converted to 2-hydroxy-6-phenyl-6-oxo-2,4-hexadienoic acid by ameta ring cleavage dioxygenase (HbpC). 2-Hydroxy-6-phenyl-6-oxo-2,4-hexadienoic acid is hydrolyzed by HbpD to benzoate and 2-hydroxy-2,4-pentadienoic acid (7Kohler H.-P.E.

J. 1973; 134: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). HbpA has a broad substrate spectrum, catalyzing the regioselective ortho-hydroxylation of a wide range of 2-substituted phenols to the corresponding catechols (Fig.1) (7Kohler H.-P.E. Kohler-Staub D. Focht D.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2683-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kohler H.-P.E. Schmid A. van der Maarel M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the hbpAgene was cloned into Escherichia coli, and this recombinant biocatalyst has been used for the production of different 3-substituted catechols (12Held M. Suske W. Schmid A.

One of these, 3-phenylcatechol, was produced on a kilogram scale, showing that the biocatalytic production of 3-substituted catechols is a possible alternative to chemical synthesis routes (14Held M. Biocatalytic Synthesis of 3-Substituted CatecholsPh.D. thesis. ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland2000Google Scholar). HbpA mutants with an altered substrate reactivity should allow the synthesis of catechols that are not synthesized by wild-type HbpA. Rational protein design based on a known three-dimensional structure has been used for such purposes (15Graf L. Craik C.S. Patthy A. Roczniak S. Fletterick R.J. Rutter W.J.

Here we report on the use of directed evolution to change the substrate reactivity of HbpA. We increased the specific activity of HbpA towards 2-hydroxybiphenyl, 2-sec-butylphenol, guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol), and 2-tert-butylphenol. Moreover, a significant increase in the efficiency of NADH utilization was achieved with one mutant monooxygenase. These results are interpreted at the structural level with the help of a three-dimensional model of HbpA. E. coli JM101 and plasmid pAA1 were used for cloning and gene expression. Plasmid pAA1 is a pUC18 (28Yanish-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) derivative harboring thehbpA gene as a SalI/NsiI fragment (29Schmid A.

Commercially available chemicals were purchased from Fluka AG (Buchs, Switzerland). Catalase from beef liver was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Taq DNA polymerase, restriction enzymes, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl and 3-sec-butylcatechol were prepared by whole-cell biotransformations, using a recombinantE. coli JM101 containing the hbpA gene (14Held M. Biocatalytic Synthesis of 3-Substituted CatecholsPh.D. thesis. ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland2000Google Scholar). The hbpA gene (1758 bp) in pAA1 was amplified using in vitro manganese mutagenesis (30Beckmann R.A. Mildvan A.S. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5810-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For the PCR, the M13/pUC-40 primers (MWG-Biotech GmbH, Münchenstein, Switzerland) were used, each of which complements a 23-bp region of the cloning vector. A 100-μl volume containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9), 6.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μl of Me2SO, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dNTPs, 15 pmol of each primer, 20 ng of template DNA, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) was placed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermal cycler well. After 5 min at 95 °C, the thermal cycler performed 25 cycles of the following steps: 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C. Prior to restriction, the amplified DNA was purified with a DNA clean-up kit (Genomed GmbH, Bad Oeyenhausen, Germany, or Macherey-Nagel AG, Oensingen, Switzerland). Competent E. coli JM101 cells were prepared using a modified CaCl2-based method (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The cells were diluted 1:100 into fresh LB and grown until they reached anA 600 of 0.5 ± 0.1. After centrifugation (5500 × g, 4 °C, 8 min), the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.2 volumes of 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.8), 50 mmMnCl2, and 5 mm NaCl. The suspension was put on ice for 30 min and recentrifuged as before. The pellet was dissolved in 0.1 volumes of 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.8), 70 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 5% glycerol and stored in aliquots of 100 μl at −70 °C until use. Ligation mixtures containing pUC18 (cutBamHI/SphI), amplified hbpA gene (cutBamHI/SphI), 0.5 units of T4 DNA ligase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10× ligation buffer were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The ligation mixture was directly used for transformation. For this, an aliquot of competent E. coliJM101 was thawed on ice. The cells were mixed with 1 μl of ligation mixture and placed on ice for 30 min. The heat pulse was performed at 42 °C for 90 s and followed by incubation on ice for 1 min. After the addition of 1 ml of LB, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The complete transformation mixture was transferred onto selective LB plates and incubated overnight at 30 °C. The screening procedure for the desired modified HbpA was based on the instability of the reaction products. At neutral pH, catechols autoxidize to quinones and semiquinones, which readily form reddish or brownish, undefined, high molecular weight compounds (32Ziechmann W. Huminstoffe. 1st Ed. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft GmbH, Weinheim, Germany1980Google Scholar). After transformation, E. coli JM101 transformants were transferred directly onto LB plates containing 150 μg ml−1 ampicillin, 0.04‰ (w/v) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 200 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and a 0.1–0.5 mm concentration of the 2-substituted phenol to be screened for. Incubation at 30 °C resulted in three colony types: blue colonies, which did not contain the amplified hbpA gene; white colonies, which contained an hbpA gene that encoded for an inactive enzyme towards the aromatic test substrate, or an inactive lacZ gene due to frameshifted ligation; and reddish brown colonies, which contained an enzyme with activity towards the added 2-substituted phenol. The time-dependent intensity of color formation in the latter colonies could be used to distinguish between different activities. For substrates that were only poorly transformed to the corresponding catechol, the color formation could be intensified by the addition of 1.5 mm ferric chloride and 50 μg ml−1 p-toluidine (33Parke D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 2694-2697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If positive clones were detected, the plasmids containing the amplifiedhbpA genes were isolated and retransformed into E. coli JM101. Cells from a 5-ml LB culture were spun down at 5000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 800 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). This suspension was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 1.2-g glass beads (diameter, 0.1–0.2 mm), and the cells were disrupted in a Retsch mill (Retsch GmbH, Hann, Germany) for 10 min at 90% power. The cell extracts were separated from the glass beads by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min) and supplemented with FAD to a final concentration of 50 μm. Cell extracts could be stored at −20 °C for 2–3 weeks without significant loss of HbpA activity. The purification of HbpA and its mutants was based on a simplified version of a procedure described earlier (1Suske W.A. Held M. Schmid A. Fleischmann T. Wubbolts M.G. Kohler H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24257-24265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 6 g (cell wet weight) of frozen E. coliJM101, harboring a pUC18 derivative encoding either the wild-type or the amplified hbpA gene, were suspended in 25 ml of phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5). Cell extract was prepared by twice passing the suspension through a French pressure cell (20 K; Sim Aminco) at 70 bars, followed by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C (Beckmann L8–60 m, 40,000 × g, 30 min). The clarified cell extract was diluted 1:1 with triethanolamine-HCl buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5) and loaded directly onto an anion exchange column (1.5 × 15 cm; Fractogel EMD DMAE-650 (S); Merck) equilibrated with 10 mm triethanolamine-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Elution was carried out with a linear gradient from 0 to 1m NaCl in starting buffer. Fractions containing HbpA activity were pooled, supplemented with 0.9m ammonium sulfate, and loaded onto a hydrophobic interaction chromatography column (1 × 8 cm; butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with 0.75m ammonium sulfate in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Elution was carried out with a linear gradient from 0.75 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Fractions containing HbpA were pooled and concentrated in an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device (Biomax-50K; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Concentrated enzyme (0.3 ml) was supplemented with 0.3 mmFAD and passed through a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (1.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Enzyme purity was assessed with SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide), followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. As is also the case for other flavin-containing oxygenases, NADH oxidation is partially uncoupled from substrate hydroxylation in HbpA (1Suske W.A. Held M. Schmid A. Fleischmann T. Wubbolts M.G. Kohler H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24257-24265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, specific activities were determined both for NADH oxidation and substrate consumption/product formation. NADH oxidation was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm or polarographically by monitoring oxygen consumption with an oxygen electrode (7Kohler H.-P.E. Kohler-Staub D. Focht D.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2683-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay contained 0.2–1 mm substrate, 0.3 mm NADH, 20 mm air-saturated phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and 10–20 μl of cell extract or purified protein in a total volume of 1 ml. To determine substrate utilization and product formation, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of perchloric acid, and the resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 10 min). The samples were diluted 1:1 with MeOH, 0.1% phosphoric acid and analyzed with a Hypersil ODS column (5 μm, 4.5 × 125 mm) using a Hewlett Packard HP 1050 Ti high pressure liquid chromatograph coupled to a diode array detector (HP DAD 1040M). The elution was carried out under isocratic conditions with MeOH/H2O (0.1% phosphoric acid) as mobile phase. Steady-state kinetic parameters were calculated by weighted nonlinear regression analysis (Enzfitter; Elsevier-Biosoft, UK). Uncoupling of product formation from oxygen consumption was resolved by performing HbpA activity assays in the absence and in the presence of catalase (34Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2250-2563Google Scholar). The catalase recycles 50% of the oxygen, which is used for hydrogen peroxide formation. By determining initial reaction rates in the absence and presence of catalase, the substrate related uncoupling of product formation from oxygen consumption could be calculated. The sequence of HbpA was aligned to the recently corrected sequence of phenol 2-monooxygenase fromTrichosporon cutaneum (35Xu D. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12369-12378Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with ClustalX (36Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Pewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35075) Google Scholar) using the PAM 350 matrix. Model building of HbpA was performed with MODELLER (37Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar) using the CVFF force field (38Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). The closed form of the phenol 2-monooxygenase structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1foh) was used as a template. The model was verified after several rounds of energy minimization. The stereochemical quality of the homology model was verified by PROCHECK (39Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the protein folding was assessed with PROSAII (40Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar), which evaluates the compatibility of each individual residue with its environment. The FAD and the substrate 2-hydroxybiphenyl were placed in identical positions and orientations as the FAD and phenol in the template structure. Subscript letters indicate the substrate on which the mutant was screened (G, guaiacol; T, 2-tert-butylphenol); numbers indicate the round of error-prone PCR. HbpA* represents HbpA variants in general. 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase (HbpA) was subjected to in vitro manganese mutagenesis with error-prone PCR (41Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar) and subsequent in situ screening for enzymes with an altered substrate reactivity (HbpA*). The base substitution rate in the error-prone PCR was tuned to an exchange rate of 1–3 per hbpA gene, to produce an average of one amino acid substitution per HbpA* (24Kuchner O. Arnold F.H. TIBTECH. 1997; 15: 523-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The Mn2+concentration was adapted to template composition, template length, dNTP concentration, and polymerase type. We tested different Mn2+ concentrations in a range of 0.1–1 mm. At a concentration of 0.5 mm Mn2+, 60–70% of the amplified hbpA genes encoded for active HbpA. Sequencing of randomly picked active or inactive clones showed that on average there were 1.2 amino acid substitutions per HbpA*. With respect to the base substitutions, transitions exceeded transversions by a factor of 2. The mutant library was plated on substrate-containing medium, where active HbpA produces aromatic polymers. The improvement of enzyme activity is generally associated with a decrease of theK m towards the substrate (24Kuchner O. Arnold F.H. TIBTECH. 1997; 15: 523-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We used aromatic substrate concentrations that were lower than the K mof the parent enzyme. The color of the polymer formed depended on the screening substrate used; the polymer formed from 3-methoxycatechol was brownish, whereas the 3-tert-butylcatechol polymer was reddish. Fig. 2 shows E. coliJM101 growing on solidified LB medium containing 0.5 mm2-tert-butylphenol and expressing either wild-typehbpA or hbpA T2. After the first round of mutagenesis, active clones were screened for increased activity on guaiacol and 2-tert-butylphenol. From each experiment (500 clones), we took 6–8 clones, which showed increased color formation, and determined NADH oxidation in crude cell extracts as a function of the test substrate and the physiological substrate 2-hydroxybiphenyl. In cases where the activity towards the test substrate or the ratio between the activities for the test substrate and 2-hydroxybiphenyl was higher than for the parent enzyme, product formation was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. 1The abbreviations used is:HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography The levels of HbpA and HbpA* were checked with SDS-PAGE to correct for different expression levels. high pressure liquid chromatography Eight clones were initially selected following in situscreening on guaiacol. In five cell extracts, the recombinant protein level was increased, but the specific HbpA* activity remained constant. Two cell extracts contained HbpA* with a lower in vitroactivity than the wild type enzyme. Sequencing revealed that both enzymes contained one amino acid substitution, which probably decreased the enzyme stability in vitro but not in vivo. One mutant monooxygenase was found to have an increased specific activity towards guaiacol and was named HbpAG1. Six clones were initially selected following in situscreening on 2-tert-butylphenol. Only one clone harbored anhbpA* gene with a base substitution that led to an amino acid exchange and a higher activity towards this substrate. This gene (hbpA T1) was used for another round of error-prone PCR and in situ screening. From two selected clones, we obtained one mutant monooxygenase with a higher activity towards 2-tert-butylphenol. This variant was named HbpAT2. ThehbpA T1 and the hbpA G1genes each contained one and the hbpA T2 gene contained two base substitutions that led to an amino acid change (Table I). In addition,hbpA T1 and hbpA T2 each carried one silent mutation, and hbpA G1 carried 2 base substitutions that did not result in an amino acid change.Table IAmino acid substitutions in HbpA mutantsEnzymeAmino acid position244368417HbpAIleValLeuHbpAG1Ile → ValValLeuHbpAT1IleVal → AlaLeuHbpAT2IleVal → AlaLeu → Phe Open table in a new tab Wild-type and mutant HbpA were purified from recombinant E. coli JM101 harboring a pUC18 derivative carrying the correspondinghbpA gene. Using this system, HbpA and HbpA* could be overexpressed to about 20% of total cell protein. The enzymes were purified as tetramers to homogeneity with yields around 30%. Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3), which showed only HbpA or HbpA* monomers. The mutant enzymes followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with all substrates tested as does wild-type HbpA. For K′mdeterminations, HbpA and HbpA* activities were measured by NADH oxidation at different substrate concentrations. All mutants showed an increased K′m towards the natural substrate 2-hydroxybiphenyl, whereas K′m remained unchanged for 2-sec-butylphenol. The K′m towards guaiacol was significantly decreased for all mutants (TableII).Table IIApparent Km values of HbpA and mutants towards different 2-substituted phenolsR2-aSubstituent orthoto the phenolic hydroxy group.K m2-bBest fit parameters obtained from nonlinear least square fits to the Michaelis-Menten model.HbpAHbpAG1HbpAT1HbpAT2μmPhenyl2.6 ± 0.15.7 ± 0.113 ± 1.616 ± 1.4sec-Butyl8.7 ± 0.99.5 ± 1.0ND2-cNot determined.10.0 ± 0.2Methoxy2-dResulting phenol: guaiacol.588 ± 13222 ± 13337 ± 58143 ± 19Apparent K m values were determined by spectrophotometrically monitoring NADH consumption.

Because HbpA and HbpA* showed uncoupling of NADH oxidation from substrate hydroxylation for all substrates tested, apparent turnover rates were determined by measuring product formation and/or substrate consumption with reverse phase HPLC (TableIII). Using this method, HbpAG1 showed a 30% increased specific activity towards 2-hydroxybiphenyl, 2-sec-butylphenol, and guaiacol. Compared with HbpA, HbpAT2 showed half the activity towards 2-hydroxybiphenyl and a 12% lower activity towards 2-sec-butylphenol. At the same time, it revealed a 5-fold increase in activity towards 2-tert-butylphenol, the substrate on which the enzyme was screened, and twice the activity of HbpA towards guaiacol and salicylaldehyde.Table IIIkcat and kcat/Km values of HbpA and HbpA mutants towards different 2-substituted phenolsR3-aSubstituent orthoto the phenolic hydroxy group.HbpAHbpAG1HbpAT2k catk cat/K mk catk cat/K mk catk cat/K ms−1s−1μm−1s−1s−1μm−1s−1s−1μm−1Phenyl3-bActivities determined by measuring product formation and substrate consumption with reverse phase HPLC.11.94.616.22.86.40.4sec-Butyl3-bActivities determined by measuring product formation and substrate consumption with reverse phase HPLC.14.51.719.12.012.81.3Methoxy3-bActivities determined by measuring product formation and substrate consumption with reverse phase HPLC.0.951.6 × 10−31.285.8 × 10−31.831.3 × 10−2Formyl3-bActivities determined by measuring product formation and substrate consumption with reverse phase HPLC.0.5ND3-cND, not determined.0.4ND0.9NDtert-Butyl3-dActivities determined by measuring substrate consumption with reverse phase HPLC.<0.1ND<0.1ND0.5NDThe k cat values were determined for the tetrameric enzyme.

We investigated differential effects of glutathione depletion on CD95-triggered apoptosis in T and B cell lines as well as the glutathione dependence of caspase-8 activation. In B lymphoblastoid SKW6.4 cells, CD95-mediated apoptosis was prevented upstream of caspase-8 activation and caspase-3-like activity after acute glutathione depletion by diethyl maleate orcis-chloro-dinitrobenzene. Immunoprecipitation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) revealed that the DISC was still formed in the glutathione-depleted state. The first cleavage step of procaspase-8 activation at the DISC, however, was inhibited. Accordingly, under cell-free conditions, radiolabeled procaspase-8 was processed at the immunoprecipitated DISC only after the addition of exogenous dithiothreitol or reduced glutathione. We also observed suppression of CD95-mediated apoptosis in glutathione-depleted CEM and H9 cells. Notably, Jurkat cells still died upon CD95 engagement under this condition, displaying incomplete nuclear fragmentation and a partial switch to necrosis; this may be explained by reduced cytochromec/dATP-mediated caspase activation observed in cytosol from glutathione-depleted Jurkat cytosol. Our data indicate that the activation of caspase-8 at the DISC and hence CD95-mediated apoptosis induction shows a cell-specific requirement for intracellular glutathione.

In the DISC, both forms of procaspase-8 are autoproteolytically cleaved to intermediates of 43 and 41 kDa, respectively. Subsequently, a heterotetramer of two small (10 kDa) and two large (18 kDa) subunits is formed that constitutes the active enzyme (3Krammer P.H.

In different cell types, apoptosis is initiated either by activation of large amounts of caspase-8 at the DISC followed by rapid cleavage of caspase-3 (type I cells, e.g. SKW6.4, H9), or the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is the preferred route as a result of reduced DISC formation in those cells (type II cells,e.g. Jurkat, CEM) (13Scaffidi C.

On the other hand, pro-oxidative conditions including direct depletion of GSH can be cytoprotective in many systems; oxidants such as dithiocarbamates or superoxide attenuated CD95-mediated apoptosis (22Nobel C.S.

Vice versa, antioxidants were reported to enhance or facilitate apoptosis, e.g. the antioxidant α-liponic acid enhanced CD95-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells (31Sen C.K. Sashwati R. Packer L.

As a proposed mechanism, it has been demonstrated in many studies that under cell-free conditions, caspase activity or caspase activation requires a reducing environment: (i) oxidants such as NO or hydrogen peroxide blocked caspase-3 activity (23Hampton M.B. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 34Mohr S. Zech B. Lapetina E.G. Brüne B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar); (ii) the reductants GSH or DTT were necessary to ensure full caspase-3 activity (28Hentze H. Künstle G. Volbracht C. Ertel W. Wendel A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); and (iii) the thiol oxidant disulfiram and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) directly inhibited apoptosome-mediated caspase-3 activation (22Nobel C.S. Burgess D.H. Zhivotovsky B. Burkitt M.J. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Respective studies for the glutathione dependence of caspase-8 activation, however, are lacking. Sufficient GSH appears to be a prerequisite for death receptor-mediated apoptosis in some systems (see above). This might be due to the redox sensitivity of either caspases or the DISC, because FADD and procaspase-8 contain a number of reactive cysteine residues. This study therefore addressed whether acute depletion of GSH influences DISC formation, DISC activity, and the ensuing apoptosis in the cell lines SKW6.4, Jurkat, CEM, and H9. We further investigated whether caspase-8 activation at the immunoprecipitated DISC is redox-dependent under cell-free conditions. Glutathione monoethylester was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), 1-cis-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland),N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (DEVD-afc) and Pefablock® were from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany), and protein A-Sepharose was from Sigma.

Activating αCD95 antibody (αCD95, clone CH-11) and polyclonal IgG-horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse) were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). For DISC analysis, isotype-specific secondary antibodies from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL) were used. The αFADD mAb was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and the polyclonal αCD95 antibody was from Santa Cruz (sc-715, Santa Cruz, CA).

Other recombinant enzymes not further specified were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Sigma. Cell culture plates and other plastic materials were purchased from Greiner (Frickenhausen, Germany). Culture media were from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany), and penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal calf serum were bought from Invitrogen. The human B lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and the T leukemia cell lines Jurkat (clone E6-1), H9, and CEM (all ATCC) were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were maintained in 75-cm2 flasks in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C at 5% CO2 and were passaged routinely every 2–3 days in a ratio of 1:10 or 1:5 depending on cell density. For experiments, the cells in passages 5–10 were centrifuged (460 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), resuspended in medium, plated in 96-well plates (100 μl of cell suspension, 105 cells/well), and incubated with the compounds indicated (given in 100 μl/well; final volume, 200 μl/well) under the same conditions described for cell maintenance. To determine the amount of necrosis or apoptosis in lymphoid cells, the cultures were stained with a mixture of the membrane-permeable dye Hoechst-33342 (500 ng/ml) and the membrane-impermeable dye SYTOX (500 nm) for 5 min at 37 °C. The amount of normal, necrotic (damaged/SYTOX-permeable membrane, normal nuclei) and apoptotic (impermeable membrane, condensed/fragmented nuclei) cells were scored with a fluorescence microscope. The amount of GSH was quantified according to the enzymatic cycling method originally described by Tietze (37Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS, subsequently frozen at −80 °C in 1% sulfosalicylic acid, thawed, and the supernatants were separated from precipitated proteins by centrifugation (5 min, 14,000 ×g, 4 °C). The supernatants and standards (0–5 μm GSH) were diluted in 0.1 m HCl containing 10 mm EDTA, and total glutathione was quantified with an ACP 5040 analyzer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The activity of caspase- 3-like proteases was measured on microtiter plates according to Thornberry (38Thornberry N.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed (freeze-thaw in lysis buffer: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Pefablock®, and 1 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin, 0.1% Triton X-100), the lysate was subsequently centrifuged (15 min, 14,000 × g, 4 °C), and the clear supernatant was stored at −80 °C. The samples were diluted 1:10 with substrate buffer (60 μmfluorogenic substrate DEVD-afc in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm DTT or as indicated) at a final volume of 100 μl, and blanks contained 10 μl of extraction buffer plus 90 μl of substrate buffer. Generation of free afc at 37 °C was kinetically determined by fluorescence measurement (excitation, 385 nm; emission, 505 nm) using the fluorometer plate reader Victor2 (Wallac Instruments, Turku, Finland). Protein concentrations of the corresponding samples were estimated with the Pierce assay, and the activity was calculated using serially diluted standards (0–5 μm afc). Jurkat cells were maintained at 2 × 107 cells/sample in 50-ml Falcon tubes, treated as indicated, and subsequently centrifuged (5 min, 460 × g, 4 °C). The pellet was lysed by repeated freeze-thawing in 50 μl of hypotonic extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmPefablock®, and 1 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin and aprotinin; modified from Ref. 39Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M. Naiem S.S. Rabizadeh S. Salvesen G.S. Casiano C.A. Cashman N.R. Green D.R. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6165-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and centrifuged (15 min, 14,000 ×g, 4 °C). The protein contents of all samples were adjusted to 12 mg/ml, and triplicates (8 μl) of each sample were diluted with 2 μl of hypotonic extraction buffer containing cytc, dATP, or DTT (final concentrations, 10 μm, 5 mm, and 10 mm, respectively) as indicated on round-bottomed microtiter plates. Then caspase activation took place at 37 °C for 30 min in the fluorometer plate reader Victor2(Wallac Instruments). The reaction was stopped by addition of substrate buffer (120 μm fluorogenic substrate DEVD-afc in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm DTT) by an automatic dispenser device, and DEVD-afc cleavage was determined as described above. The formation of the CD95 DISC in SKW6.4 cells was studied by immunoprecipitation of the receptor as described (1Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). SKW6.4 cells were maintained in 50-ml Falcon tubes at a number of 107 cells/sample with or without the addition of the indicated concentrations of GSH depletors. After 1 h, the cells were treated with 2 μg/ml αAPO1 mAb for 10 min at 37 °C. After addition of 50 ml of ice-cold PBS and short centrifugation (460 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), the cell pellet was lysed (lysis buffer was 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin A). Serving as an unstimulated negative control, one sample of cells was lysed in lysis buffer before supplementation with αAPO1. After centrifugation of the lysates (15 min, 14,000 × g, 4 °C), the CD95 DISC was precipitated for 1 h at 4 °C from supernatants with protein A-Sepharose. After immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed five times with 20 volumes of lysis buffer and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE separation. Depending on the protein that was detected, the samples (20–60 μg of protein/lane) were loaded on a 12 or 15% polyacrylamide gel, separated under reducing conditions, and subsequently blotted on a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in a semi-dry blotter at 0.8 mA/cm2 for 90 min. The blots were blocked for at least 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS/Tween (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20), washed with PBS/Tween, and then incubated with the following primary antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C: αFADD mAb (1:250 in PBS/Tween); αcaspase-8 mAb C15 (1:20 in PBS/Tween, hybridoma cell supernatant); αc-FLIP mAb NF6 (1:10 in PBS/Tween, hybridoma cell supernatant); and αCD95 polyclonal antibody (1:500 in PBS/Tween, 5% nonfat dry milk). After washing in PBS/Tween and incubation with polyclonal secondary antibodies (1:20,000 in PBS/Tween), the blots were developed by the chemiluminescence method (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Caspase-8/a was in vitro translated using a T7 polymerase-directed reticulate lysate system (TNT; Promega).In vitro cleavage assays were performed as follows. The CD95 DISC was immunoprecipitated from 2 × 107 cells as described above. Subsequently, the beads containing the DISC were incubated in 50 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CAPS, and 20% sucrose) in the absence or presence of 10 mm DTT or 10 mm GSH for 24 h at 4 °C with 0.5 μl of in vitrotranslated caspase-8/a (41Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). To reduce autoxidized glutathione in the incubation, 100 μm NADPH and 0.2 unit/ml GSSG reductase were added to the GSH-treated sample and as an additional control. After boiling for 3 min in a standard reducing sample buffer, the resulting products were analyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE with subsequent amplification (Amplify; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), drying of the gels, and autoradiography. All data are given as the means ± S.D. The statistical differences were determined using the software GraphPad Instat® by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey multiple comparison test of the control versus other groups.p < 0.01 was considered significant. Initially, various compounds were tested for their capacity to lower GSH in SKW6.4 cells. The GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) induced a sustained decrease in intracellular GSH to about half of the initial concentration (Fig.1 A). Either of the two GSHS-transferase substrates diethylmaleate (DEM) and 1-cis-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) given in combination with BSO depleted intracellular GSH to below 10% of the initial concentration in 1 h. This depletion occurred without measurable toxicity within 4 h as determined by SYTOX/Hoechst staining. Further experiments showed that DEM was toxic at concentrations >2 mm and that CDNB was toxic at concentrations >20 μm. Notably, SKW6.4 cells in later passages were generally prone to higher basal toxicity and hence tolerated GSH depletion less well; therefore only cells in passages 5–10 were used for following experiments. For repleting GSH, the cell-permeable GSH donor glutathione monoethylester (GSH-E) was used (42Anderson M.E. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 18: 65-78Google Scholar). Depletion of GSH for 1 h followed by 1 h of repletion with 10 mm GSH ester was the most effective incubation scheme for GSH repletion (Fig. 1 B). Complete restoration of GSH by the ester was achieved following depletion with 2.5 μm CDNB in the presence of BSO, whereas only a partial repletion was seen at higher CDNB concentrations. Thus, intracellular GSH levels in SKW6.4 cells can be manipulated by the compounds mentioned without affecting cell viability. Next, we investigated whether CD95-mediated apoptosis in SKW6.4 cells is affected by GSH variations. As shown in Fig.2 A, exposure of cells to a CD95-activating antibody (CH-11) for 4 h resulted in about 70% apoptotic cells as determined by Hoechst/SYTOX exclusion staining. When cells were depleted of GSH by DEM or CDNB and then subjected to CD95 activation by CH-11, only <10% apoptotic cells were found after 4 h (Fig. 2, A and B). Upon death receptor stimulation, apoptosis is initiated by caspase-8 and executed by caspase-3-related caspases (43Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A., Nj, J. Scaffidi C.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). All known caspases are redox-sensitive proteases (22Nobel C.S. Burgess D.H. Zhivotovsky B. Burkitt M.J. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 23Hampton M.B. Orrenius S.

Therefore, caspase-3-like proteolytic activity was first examined upon CD95 stimulation. 4 h after CD95 engagement, a high DEVD cleaving activity was determined (Fig. 2 C, filled squares). In the presence of DEM alone or DEM plus BSO, caspase activity was suppressed at this time to 42% or <20%, respectively. Because the DEVD-afc cleavage assay was carried out in the presence of 10 mm of the thiol reductant DTT, a condition sufficient to reactivate oxidized caspases (34Mohr S. Zech B. Lapetina E.G. Brüne B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 46Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8487-8491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we concluded that the observed decrease in caspase-3-like activity represents a reduction of executioner caspase activationrather than a reduction in activity itself. Western blot analysis of caspase-8 activation after CD95 triggering showed that the active caspase-8 p18 fragment was not detectable in cytosolic extracts upon GSH depletion by DEM (Fig. 2 D), indicating that CD95 signal transduction was blocked upstream of caspase-8 cleavage to its active form. Therefore, CD95 DISC formation and activity was eventually analyzed in SKW6.4 cells (see below). Caspases can form mixed disulfides with agents such as dithiocarbamates, resulting in their inactivation (22Nobel C.S. Burgess D.H. Zhivotovsky B. Burkitt M.J. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, a possible direct interaction of DEM or CDNB with caspases was addressed by two experimental approaches. First, the influence of GSH repletion on CD95-induced caspase activation was examined. Caspase-3-like activity 4 h after CD95 engagement was inhibited by CDNB in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3 A; data for DEM not shown). In SKW6.4 cells depleted of GSH by 5 μm CDNB, 2 mm GSH ester was sufficient to significantly restore activation of executioner caspases (Fig. 3 B). In addition, CDNB (up to 20 μm) or DEM (up to 4 mm), did not affect caspase-3-like activity when directly added in vitro to the cleavage assay in the absence of DTT (data not shown). These data imply that reagents that deplete GSH enzymatically do not directly interfere with the enzymatic activity of caspases but rather disable CD95-mediated apoptotic signaling viasecondary effects following depletion of GSH. The active caspase-8 p18 fragment was not detectable in cytosolic extracts of SKW6.4 cells after GSH depletion by DEM and CD95 ligation (Fig. 2 D). Therefore, CD95 DISC formation as a prerequisite for caspase-8 activation was analyzed (Fig. 4 A). The DISC contains several proteins including FADD, the long and short form of c-FLIP (FLICE-inhibitory protein), and caspase-8. These proteins all contain several cysteine residues, and we therefore investigated whether the proper assembly of the DISC is affected by GSH. After maintenance of SKW6.4 cells for 1 h in medium containing BSO plus 0.25 to 1 mm DEM, the DISC was stimulated and immunoprecipitated with the antibody αAPO1 as described (1Kischkel F.C.

To further characterize the molecular organization of TJs, we attempted here to screen for novel TJ proteins by the fluorescence localization-based expression cloning method. We identified a novel peripheral membrane protein at TJs and named it junction-enriched and -associated protein (JEAP). JEAP consists of 882 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 98,444. JEAP contained a polyglutamic acid repeat at the N-terminal region, a coiled-coil domain at the middle region, and a consensus motif for binding to PDZ domains at the C-terminal region. Exogenously expressed JEAP co-localized with ZO-1 and occludin at TJs in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, but not with claudin-1, JAM, or ZO-1 in L cells.

We have cloned several novel cDNA fragments, one of which specifically localizes at TJs. We named this protein junction-enriched and -associated protein (JEAP) and characterized it. An endothelial cell line, MS-1, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM with 5% fetal calf serum. MDCK cells were kindly supplied by Dr. W. Birchmeier (Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany) and cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. For generation of ecotropic retrovirus competent MDCK cells (MDCK/EcoVR), the ecotropic virus receptor (EcoVR) cDNA was inserted into pCAGGS-puro (43Imai T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15036-15042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and transfected to MDCK cells using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were then cultured for 24 h, replated, and selected with 5 μg/ml of puromycin (Invitrogen). Each clone was isolated and infected with pMXII-EGFPN recombinant retrovirus (44Ono Y.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3050-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and a high competent clone for infection was used for the following studies. EcoVR cDNA (45Baker B.W. Boettiger D.

Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. T. Kitamura (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan). Claudin-L cells and JAM-L cells were kindly supplied by Dr. Sh. Tsukita (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). L cells were transfected by use of LipofectAMINE. To identify novel cDNAs that encode proteins localized at cellular junctions, we created a cDNA-GFP fusion library from MS-1, a mouse endothelial cell line, as described previously (42Misawa K. Nosaka T. Morita S. Kaneko A. Nakahata T. Asano S. Kitamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3062-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The resulting library contained 3 × 105 independent clones and showed an average insert size of cDNA with 1,500 bp. The expression library was then co-transfected into 293/EBNA-1 cells (Invitrogen) with a packaging vector, pCL-Eco (Imgenex, San Diego, CA), and converted to retroviruses. From a pilot experiment using VE-cadherin-EGFP fusion retrovirus with various cell lines, we found that MDCK/EcoVR cells were suitable for visual screening of junctional proteins because these cells are cuboid and showed bright signals. MDCK/EcoVR cells were, thus, infected with 2 ml of variously diluted retrovirus supernatants to obtain singly infected cells. The initial frequency of the EGFP-positive cells was ∼4% as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. After expansion, EGFP-positive cells were sorted and cultured at 50 cells per each well in 96-well plates. When the wells became confluent, we performed screening of 10 plates under the fluorescence microscope and selected 6 wells containing cells with junctional staining patterns. These cells were replated into 10-cm dishes and a single clone was obtained. Each clone was expanded in 24-well plates, and the integrated cDNA was recovered by PCR from the genomic DNA. Among the cDNAs showing the junctional staining pattern, we obtained a novel cDNA clone and analyzed it. Full-length JEAP cDNAs were obtained from a MS-1 cDNA library constructed with pMXII vector (44Ono Y. Nakanishi H. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Satoh-Horikawa K. Mandai K.

Two clones (2E5–1 and 4E1–2) were used here. Rabbit anti-ZO-1 pAb, rabbit anti-claudin pAb, mouse anti-ZO-1 mAb, and mouse anti-occludin mAb were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Rat anti-E-cadherin mAb was obtained from Takara. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (47Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J.

Briefly, MDCK/EcoVR cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min. The fixed sample was treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and washed with PBS three times. After the sample was soaked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, the sample was incubated with various combinations of the anti-E-cadherin, anti-occludin, anti-claudin, anti-ZO-1, and anti-JEAP Abs and washed with PBS, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-, Cy3-, Cy5-labeled secondary pAbs (Jackson). After incubation, the sample was washed with PBS, embedded in PBS containing 50% glycerol and 0.1% 1,4-diazabicyclo octane (DABCO), and analyzed by a LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss). Ca2+ switch experiments using JEAP-expressing MDCK cells were done as previously described (26Ide N. Hata Y. Nishioka H. Hirao K. Yao I. Deguchi M. Mizoguchi A. Nishimori H. Tokino T. Nakamura Y.

Briefly, the pMXII JEAP IRES-EGFP expression vector was constructed by inserting the full-length JEAP coding region amplified by PCR from the pMXII JEAP cDNA into pMXII IRES-EGFP (44Ono Y.

The expression vector was transfected into 293/EBNA-1 cells with a packaging vector, converted to retroviruses, and infected to MDCK/EcoVR cells. JEAP-expressing MDCK cells were washed with PBS and cultured in DMEM without serum for 1 h. The cells were then transferred to DMEM with 5 mm EGTA and cultured for 2 h. After the culture, cells were washed with PBS and cultured either in DMEM without serum for 2 h or in DMEM with 100 nm TPA for 1 h. Other procedures, including Western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy of frozen sections, and immunoelectron microscopy, were performed as described (47Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M.

To identify novel cDNAs that encode proteins localized at cell-cell junctions, we created a cDNA-GFP fusion library from MS-1, a mouse endothelial cell line (Fig. 1 A). The expression library was then co-transfected into 293/EBNA-1 cells with a packaging vector and converted to retroviruses. MDCK/EcoVR cells were infected with 2 ml of variously diluted retrovirus supernatants to obtain singly infected cells. We performed screening and selected 6 wells containing cells with junctional staining patterns. These cells were replated into 10-cm dishes, and a single clone was obtained. The integrated cDNA was recovered by PCR from the genomic DNA. Among the cDNAs showing the junctional staining pattern, we obtained a novel cDNA clone and further analyzed it. The full-length cDNA clone was isolated from the MS-1 cDNA library. We named this protein JEAP because it localized at TJs as described below. The full-length clone of the JEAP cDNA encoded a protein with 882 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 98,444 (Fig. 2 A). JEAP contained a polyglutamic acid repeat at the N-terminal region, a coiled-coil domain at the middle region (51Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3459) Google Scholar, 52Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), and a consensus motif for binding to PDZ domains at the C-terminal region (53Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 B). To confirm whether the isolated clone encodes the entire coding region of JEAP, 293/EBNA-1 cells were transfected with the JEAP cDNA, and the expressed protein was detected by Western blotting. A single band of about 105 kDa was detected in the extract from the 293/EBNA-1 cells transfected with JEAP, but not in that from nontransfected 293/EBNA-1 cells (Fig. 2 C). The size of the expressed protein was similar to that of endogenous JEAP in MS-1 cells. Therefore, we concluded that the isolated cDNA encodes the full-length of JEAP. To first confirm the junctional localization of the full-length protein, full-length JEAP was expressed in MDCK/EcoVR cells as an EGFP fusion protein. The fusion protein localized at the apical region of the lateral membrane of polarized MDCK cells (Fig.3 A). The distribution pattern of the fusion protein was similar to that of ZO-1, which localized at TJs in polarized epithelial cells (15Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 54Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Kitani-Yasuda T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), but different from that of E-cadherin which showed broad distribution along the lateral membrane. To confirm the co-localization of JEAP and ZO-1, full-length JEAP was stably expressed in MDCK/EcoVR cells, and the localization of the expressed protein was compared with that of endogenous ZO-1. Exogenously expressed JEAP co-localized with ZO-1 (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that JEAP localizes at TJs. We next examined tissue distribution of JEAP in various mouse tissues including liver, brain, lung, kidney, spleen, testis, ovary, and heart by Western blotting, but did not detect JEAP in any of these tissues (data not shown). We then examined tissue distribution immunohistochemically. JEAP was detected specifically in exocrine glands including pancreas, submandibular gland, lacrimal gland (Fig.4 A), parotid gland, and sublingual gland, but not in brain, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, gall bladder, or duodenum (data not shown). In exocrine glands, JEAP was expressed around the terminal portion of serous glands. In the terminal portion, JEAP showed a similar staining pattern to that of ZO-1. Although MS-1 cells expressed JEAP, we detected no staining signal for JEAP in endothelial cells in any organs. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that JEAP indeed localized at TJs, but not at AJs or desmosomes, in the lacrimal gland (Fig. 4 B). We next monitored the behavior of JEAP and other AJ and TJ components during the disruption and reformation of cell-cell junctions. For this purpose, we used a MDCK cell line stably expressing JEAP, because it has been shown that when MDCK cells are cultured at 2 μm Ca2+ for 2 h, AJs and TJs are disrupted, and the staining of the AJ and TJ components except nectin, afadin, and ZO-1 disappear from the plasma membrane, and that when the cells are recultured at 2 mm Ca2+ for 2 h, AJs and TJs are reformed where all the AJ and TJ components reconcentrate (26Ide N.

At 2 mm Ca2+, JEAP co-localized with ZO-1 at cell-cell junctions as described above (Figs.3 B and 5). When the cells were cultured at 2 μm Ca2+ for 2 h, the immunofluorescence signal for JEAP disappeared, whereas the sparse signal for ZO-1 was detected near the plasma membrane. After reculture of the cells at 2 mm Ca2+ for 2 h, JEAP as well as ZO-1 accumulated at the cell-cell junctions (Fig.5). It has been shown that when MDCK cells, precultured at 2 μm Ca2+ for 2 h, are cultured with TPA at 2 μm Ca2+ for 1 h, a TJ-like structure is formed, although AJs are not formed (26Ide N. Hata Y.

We have shown that claudin, occludin, JAM, nectin, ZO-1, and afadin, but not E-cadherin, α- or β-catenin, are concentrated there (26Ide N. Hata Y. Nishioka H. Hirao K. Yao I. Deguchi M. Mizoguchi A.

Kita, and Y. Takai, unpublished data. JEAP was also recruited to the TPA-induced TJ-like structure (Fig. 5). Similarly, JEAP co-localized with occludin and claudin-1 at cell-cell junctions (data not shown). These results indicate that JEAP is incorporated into TJs along with other components of TJs. We examined whether JEAP directly interacts with claudin or JAM. For this purpose, cadherin-deficient L cells stably expressing claudin-1 or JAM (claudin-L and JAM-L cells, respectively) (8Furuse M. Sasaki H. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 39Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected with pMXII JEAP IRES-EGFP. In claudin-L cells, ZO-1 was concentrated at cell-cell contact sites, but transiently expressed JEAP was not concentrated there (Fig.6). In JAM-L cells, ZO-1 was concentrated at cell-cell contact sites, but JEAP was not concentrated there (Fig.6). Although we have not examined the in vitro binding of JEAP with claudin, JAM, or ZO-1, these results suggest that JEAP does not directly interact with any of these proteins. In the present study, we have identified a novel component of TJs by visual screening with cDNA-EGFP fusion proteins expressed in the living cells. This strategy is fascinating for cloning of junctional proteins that are difficult to obtain from cell fractionation techniques (e.g. components may be lost during biochemical purification or dynamically shuttle among subcellular compartments and may be restricted in a small fraction of organelles, cell types, or tissues). In fact, we have isolated a novel TJ protein, JEAP, which is expressed in very restricted compartments, the terminal portion of exocrine glands. JEAP is a novel type of a TJ component consisting of the coiled-coil domain and a consensus motif for binding to PDZ domains. Coiled-coil domains have been identified in a variety of cytoskeletal proteins and are involved in inter- or intramolecular protein-protein interactions (51Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3459) Google Scholar, 52Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil domain of JEAP shows weak similarity to the conserved domain of intermediate filament proteins and myosin tail as estimated by CD search (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml). In the case of TJ proteins, occludin and cingulin also have similar conserved coiled-coil domains (10Ando-Akatsuka Y. Saitou M. Hirase T. Kishi M. Sakakibara A. Itoh M. Yonemura S. Furuse M.

Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Another feature of JEAP is the C-terminal consensus motif for binding to PDZ domains (53Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Integral membrane TJ proteins, claudin and JAM possess a PDZ-binding motif and interact with membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUK) including ZO-1, -2, or -3, via the PDZ domain (6Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 7Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Although JEAP contains the potential protein-protein interaction domains, the mechanism of its specific localization at TJs remains unknown. The present results, however, suggest that JEAP does not directly interact with claudin-1, JAM, or ZO-1. JEAP may interact with other known or still unidentified molecule(s) and localizes at TJs through interaction with this protein(s). Identification of such a molecule would be important for our understanding of the mechanism of the specific localization of JEAP at TJs. At present, the function of JEAP in the exocrine glands remains unknown. However, the presence of cell type- and tissue-specific peripheral membrane proteins at TJs suggests that specialized epithelial and/or endothelial cells possess unique junctional complexes depending on their functions. In this context, membrane proteins at TJs, claudins, and JAMs, are differentially expressed in various combinations in epithelial and/or endothelial cells (6Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 7Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that claudin-2 controls paracellar permeability of MDCK cells (56Furuse M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that JEAP also regulates assembly or integrity of TJs of exocrine-terminal portions in which TJs function as a barrier to prevent spilling of exocrine juice into organs. A data base search has revealed two related proteins, KIAA0989 and angiomotin, suggesting that JEAP comprises a family. KIAA0989 has not been characterized but angiomotin is a 72-kDa protein that is expressed selectively in capillary endothelial cells as well as in actively angiogenic tissues, such as placenta and solid tumors (57Troyanovsky B. Levchenko T. Mansson G. Matvijenko O. Holmgren L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It localizes at the lamellipodia of the leading edge of migrating endothelial cells and is implicated in the angiostatin-mediated regulation of cell motility and capillary formation. The primary structure, subcellular localization, and tissue distribution of angiomotin are, however, different from those of JEAP, suggesting that each member of the JEAP family has unique characteristics in terms of function and subcellular distribution.

The physiological role of CEL was originally thought to be its mediation of dietary cholesterol absorption. However, recent studies showed no difference between wild type and CEL knockout mice in the total amount of cholesterol absorbed in a single meal. The current study tests the hypothesis that CEL in the intestinal lumen may influence the type of lipoproteins produced. A lipid emulsion containing 4 mm phospholipid, 13.33 mm[3H]triolein, and 2.6 mm[14C]cholesterol in 19 mm taurocholate was infused into the duodenum of lymph fistula CEL(+/+) and CEL(−/−) mice at a rate of 0.3 ml/h. Results showed no difference between CEL(+/+) and CEL(−/−) mice in the rate of cholesterol and triglyceride transport from the intestinal lumen to the lymph. However, CEL(−/−) mice produced predominantly smaller lipoproteins, whereas the CEL(+/+) mice produced primarily large chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein. The proximal intestine of CEL(−/−) mice was also found to possess significantly less ceramide hydrolytic activity than that present in CEL(+/+) mice. By using Caco2 cells grown on Transwell membranes as a model, sphingomyelinase treatment inhibited the secretion of larger chylomicron-like lipoproteins without affecting total cholesterol secretion. In contrast, the addition of CEL to the apical medium increased the amount of large lipoproteins produced and alleviated the inhibition induced by sphingomyelinase. Taken together, this study identified a novel and physiologically significant role for CEL, namely the promotion of large chylomicron production in the intestine. The mechanism appears to be mediated through CEL hydrolysis of ceramide generated during the lipid absorption process.

Hartsuck J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 2Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The enzyme is synthesized in the acinar cells of the pancreas and is stored in zymogen granules. Upon food ingestion, CEL is released into the intestinal lumen where it constitutes 1–5% of total protein in pancreatic juice (3Blackberg L. Lombardo D. Hernell O. Guy O. Olivecrona T. FEBS Lett. 1981; 136: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Wang C. Kloer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 754: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The same enzyme is also present as a major protein in milk and as a minor constituent in liver, activated macrophages, and endothelial cells (5Harrison E.H. Biochim. Biophys.

The abundance of CEL in pancreatic juice and in milk of a number of mammals led to the early speculation of its role in dietary lipid absorption (10Gallo L.L. Newbill T. Hyun J. Vahouny G.V. Treadwell C.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1977; 156: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Bhat S.G. Brockman H.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 1988; 85: 7438-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of CEL in dietary lipid absorption remains controversial despite over 20 years of investigations. For example, one study showed that infusion of pancreatic juice containing CEL, but not juice devoid of CEL by immunoprecipitation, restored normal cholesterol absorption in pancreatectomized rats (10Gallo L.L. Newbill T. Hyun J. Vahouny G.V. Treadwell C.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1977; 156: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Gallo L.L. Clark S.B. Myers S. Vahouny G.V. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 604-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, another study showed that cholesterol absorption was not affected by pancreatic diversion (14Watt S.M. Simmonds W.J. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 157-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro tissue culture studies also failed to resolve this issue, with experiments showing that the inclusion of CEL can either facilitate or have no effect on cholesterol transport by the enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells (12Bosner M.S.

Although recent studies with CEL gene-targeted mice demonstrated that CEL deficiency did not alter the total amount of cholesterol absorbed from a bolus meal over a 24-h period (17Howles P.N.

Breslow J.L. Fisher E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whether CEL has any influence on the rate of intestinal cholesterol absorption and/or the type of lipoproteins produced in the intestine remains unknown. One difficulty in assigning specific role(s) for each protein in lipid absorption is the complexity of the process. After lipid digestion and solubilization with bile salt micelles in the intestinal lumen (19Hernell O. Acta Pediatr. Scand. 1990; 365: 20-27Crossref Google Scholar, 20Hernell O. Staggers J.E.

Bliss C.M. Am. Rev. Physiol. 1983; 45: 651-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), lipid nutrients are absorbed by enterocytes, resynthesized, and assembled into lipoproteins (a process that entails shuttling through several intracellular compartments) prior to their secretion into the lymph. The first step of this process is microsomal triglyceride transfer protein-mediated lipidation of apoB in the lumen of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (23Hamilton R.L. Erickson S.K. Havel R.J. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 10: 414-418Google Scholar, 24Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Cham C.M. Nielsen L.B. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1543-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid-poor apoB particles fuse with apoB-free triacylglycerol-rich particles in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (23Hamilton R.L. Erickson S.K. Havel R.J. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 10: 414-418Google Scholar, 24Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Cham C.M. Nielsen L.B. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1543-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these partially matured lipoproteins are then delivered to the Golgi for final processing prior to secretion into the lymphatics (25Mansbach C.M. Nevin P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 963-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence shows that the transport of pre-chylomicrons from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi is a vesicular process mediated by pre-chylomicron transport vesicles (26Kumar N.S. Mansbach C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G378-G386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies (27Fukunaga T. Nagahama M. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3299-3307PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rosenwald A.G. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4577-4579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that naturally occurring long chain ceramides, such as those generated from sphingomyelin hydrolysis, are promoters of Golgi disassembly and are capable of disrupting protein trafficking through intracellular secretory pathways. In view of observations that CEL possesses lipoamidase activity (29Hui D.Y. Hayakawa K. Oizumi J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and is capable of hydrolyzing ceramide (30Nyberg L. Farooqi A. Blackberg L. Duan R.D. Nilsson A. Hernell O. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1998; 27: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), this study was undertaken to test the possibility that CEL may influence intestinal lipoprotein assembly and transport. Cholesterol, taurocholate, monooleylglycerol, oleic acid, egg phosphatidylcholine, and triolein were obtained from Sigma. [14C]Cholesterol and [3H]triolein were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]d-erythro-N-acetylsphingosine (C6-ceramide) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) and C6-ceramide were from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). Human CEL was purified from human milk (generous gift from Dr. Ron Jandecek, Procter & Gamble, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) using the same procedure as described previously for the purification of rat pancreatic CEL (7Camulli E.A. Linke M.J. Brockman H.L. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1005: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Formvar-coated grids used for electron microscopy were obtained from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA). Free and total cholesterol analysis kits were purchased from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA). The human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line Caco2 cells was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA; ATCC HTB 37). Costar Transwells (6-well; 3-μm pore) were obtained from Fisher. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The CEL(−/−) mice were produced and bred in our institutional animal facility. The characteristics of these mice have been reported previously (17Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Under halothane anesthesia, the major intestinal lymph duct of CEL(+/+) and CEL(−/−) mice was cannulated superior to the superior mesenteric artery as described (31Tso P. Simmonds W.J. Story J.A. Lipid Research Methodology. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1984: 191-216Google Scholar, 32Richmond B.L. Boileau A.C. Zheng S. Huggins K.W. Granholm N.A. Tso P. Hui D.Y. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1193-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The lymph cannula was primed with a heparin sodium solution (1,000 units/ml) to prevent clotting. A silicone tube was passed through the fundus of the stomach and extended into the duodenum. The fundal incision was closed using a purse-string suture. Postoperatively, the animals were infused with a 5% dextrose saline solution (145 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 0.28 mm dextrose) at a constant rate of 0.3 ml/h. The animals were maintained overnight at 30 °C before lipid infusion. On the day of experiments, mice were infused with an emulsion that consisted of 4 mm egg phosphatidylcholine, 13.33 mm[3H]triolein, and 2.6 mm[14C]cholesterol in 19 mm taurocholate at a rate of 0.3 ml/h. Lymph was collected for 1 h prior to lipid infusion and served as the fasting lymph. After beginning lipid infusion, lymph was collected hourly for 6 h. Appearance of radiolabel in lymph was determined by scintillation counting. Lipoproteins from mesenteric lymph were adsorbed onto 300-mesh Formvar-coated grids, air-dried, and stained either with 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 6.9, for 30 s or dual stained with 4% osmium tetroxide and 1% phosphotungstic acid in 0.1% sucrose as described (33Anderson L.J. Boyles J.K. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1819-1824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were taken of random areas of several grids at a magnification of ×40,000 using a Hitachi H-600 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The diameters of 400 particles were measured from representative photographs to determine particle sizes. Substrate for measuring ceramide hydrolytic activity was prepared by dissolving 0.5 μmol of unlabeled C-6 ceramide and 1 μCi of [3H]C6-ceramide in ethanol and then dried under nitrogen. The sample was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 4 mmtaurocholate and then sonicated for 10 min at 4 °C. Ceramidase assay was commenced by adding 0.1 ml of purified CEL solution in phosphate-buffered saline to 0.5 ml of the ceramide substrate. Incubation was continued at 37 °C for 1 h. Reaction was terminated by addition of 1 ml of 50 mm sodium borate, 50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 10.0. Fatty acids were extracted by addition of 3 ml of methanol/chloroform/heptane (1.41:1.25:1.0, v/v/v) and centrifugation for 30 min at 5,000 × g. A 0.75-ml aliquot of the top aqueous phase was added to 15 ml of scintillation fluid for radioactivity determination in a scintillation counter. Extraction efficiency was determined empirically to be 80%, which was corrected in the report of results. For the determination of ceramide hydrolytic activity in small intestine, the tissue was removed from CEL(+/+) and CEL(−/−) mice immediately after their sacrifice. The intestine was flushed with cold saline and then sectioned into four equal fractions proximal to distal. The mucosa was scraped using glass microscope slides and suspended in 5 ml of buffer containing 300 mm mannitol, 1 mmEGTA, 2.4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1. Particulate fraction containing brush border membranes was prepared by a modification of Kessler's divalent cation precipitation method (34Rigtrup K.M. Ong D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2920-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 ml of H2O was added to the mucosal scrapings for homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer. A 0.25-ml aliquot of 1 mMgCl2 was added to each homogenate, and the sample was incubated on ice for 15 min prior to centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. Pellet containing cellular membrane proteins, including brush border membranes, was resuspended in 60 mm mannitol, 5 mm EGTA, 12 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.1. Protein content was determined by the Lowry procedure (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 50 μg of membrane proteins were used for ceramidase activity determinations. Human Caco-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 15% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Stock cultures were maintained in 75-cm2 flasks, and medium was changed every 3–4 days. The cells were seeded on polycarbonate semi-permeable (3-μm pores) Transwell membranes in 6-well culture dishes at 106 cells per well. Cultures were grown to 21–25 days post-confluency prior to experiments. Lipid substrates containing 50 μm cholesterol, 30 μm monoolein, 1.6 mm oleic acid, and 1 mm taurocholate were prepared by drying contents under N2 and dissolving in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium by sonication. Trace amounts of [14C]cholesterol were added to the micelles to monitor cholesterol transport. SMase and CEL, in phosphate-buffered saline, were added to micelle preparations at final concentrations of 100 milliunits/ml and 10 μg/ml, respectively. On the day of the experiments, the Caco2 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. 2 ml of fresh serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were added to the basolateral surface, and 2 ml of the micellar preparations were added to the apical surface. Incubations were continued at 37 °C for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, the basolateral medium was collected. An aliquot of the medium was used for radioactivity determinations to measure cholesterol secretion. Another aliquot of the basolateral medium was subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation for lipoprotein separation. Basolateral medium was collected and brought to 4 ml with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Solid KBr was added to adjust the density to 1.10 g/ml. The sample was overlaid with 3 ml each of 1.063 and 1.019 g/ml, and 2 ml of 1.006 g/ml KBr density solutions and then centrifuged for 33 min at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor at 15 °C. Large chylomicrons (with flotation rate of Sf > 400) were obtained from the top 1-ml fraction after centrifugation. The role of CEL in intestinal lipid transport was explored by comparing the rate of lymphatic absorption of radiolabeled lipids that were infused into the duodenum in lymph fistula CEL(+/+) and CEL(−/−) mice. An emulsion containing 4 mm phospholipid, 13.33 mm[3H]triolein, and 2.6 mm[14C]cholesterol in 19 mm taurocholate was infused into each animal at a rate of 0.3 ml/h. Lymph was collected hourly to monitor radiolabeled lipid output by the intestine. No difference in the absorption rate of infused cholesterol from the intestinal lumen to the mesenteric lymph was observed between CEL(+/+) and CEL(−/−) mice (Fig. 1A). Radiolabeled fatty acids derived from [3H]triolein were also secreted into the lymph at a similar rate for both CEL(+/+) and CEL(−/−) mice (Fig. 1B). However, when lymph from these animals was analyzed by negative staining electron microscopy, a significant difference in the size of lipoprotein particles was observed (Fig. 2). The CEL(+/+) mice produced lipoproteins with sizes ranging from 40 to 260 nm (Fig. 2,A and C). Approximately 55% of the lymph lipoproteins displayed sizes >80 nm indicating a predominance of chylomicron production in the wild type mice. In contrast, lymph lipoproteins in CEL(−/−) mice were much smaller, ranging in size from 20 to 140 nm (Fig. 2, B and D). Less than 25% of the lymph lipoproteins in CEL(−/−) mice were the size of large chylomicrons (>80 nm). Most of the lymph lipoproteins (75%) in CEL(−/−) mice were 30–80 nm in diameter, suggesting that the intestines of CEL(−/−) mice secrete mostly VLDL sized lipoproteins. Analysis of the cholesterol content in the lymph of these animals revealed a higher percentage of the cholesterol was esterified in CEL(−/−) mice in comparison with that observed in CEL(+/+) mice (66versus 45%, respectively). Thus, the difference in lipoprotein particle size observed in CEL(+/+) and CEL(−/−) mice cannot be attributed to the cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity of CEL.Figure 2Size distribution of lymph lipoproteins from control and CEL-null mice. Lymph was collected from CEL(+/+) (A and C) and CEL(−/−) (B andD) lymph fistula mice 4 h after the onset of duodenal lipid infusion. The samples were adhered to 300-mesh Formvar grids and stained with either 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 6.9 (A), or dual stained with 4% osmium tetroxide and 1% phosphotungstic acid in 0.1% sucrose (B). Magnification = ×40,000 with thebars indicating 200 nm in length. Approximately 300–400 particles were counted from representative micrographs, and collective results are shown for lipoprotein particle size in CEL(+/+) (C) and CEL(−/−) (D) mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies (36Field F.J.

J. 1992; 286: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with cultured intestinal cells suggested that intestinal lipoprotein secretion may be controlled by ceramide release after membrane sphingomyelin hydrolysis. In view of our previous observation (29Hui D.Y. Hayakawa K. Oizumi J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that CEL also displays lipoamidase activity, experiments were performed to determine whether CEL influences ceramide metabolism in intestine. An initial study (30Nyberg L. Farooqi A. Blackberg L. Duan R.D. Nilsson A. Hernell O. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1998; 27: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was performed to confirm the ceramide hydrolytic activity of CEL. Incubation of C6-ceramide with CEL resulted in a CEL concentration-dependent release of free fatty acids from ceramide (Fig. 3). We then compared ceramide hydrolytic activity in the intestine of CEL(+/+) and CEL(−/−) mice. Membrane proteins prepared from the proximal intestinal mucosa of CEL(+/+) mice were found to contain approximately twice the ceramide hydrolytic activity as that present in similar preparations from CEL(−/−) mice (Fig.4). In contrast, ceramide hydrolytic activity in membrane preparations from the mid- to distal intestinal fractions was similar between CEL(+/+) and CEL(−/−) mice (Fig. 4). Because intestinal lipid absorption occurs primarily in the proximal intestine (38Sylven C. Nordstrom C. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1970; 5: 57-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results support the hypothesis that the CEL influence on intestinal lipoprotein assembly and transport may be related to the ceramidase activity of this protein.Figure 4Ceramide hydrolytic activity in intestinal homogenates from CEL(+/+) andCEL(−/−) mice. Small intestine from CEL(+/+) mice (closed bars) and CEL(−/−) mice (open bars) were flushed with phosphate-buffered saline, excised, and sectioned proximal to distal into four equally spaced sections. Mucosal homogenates and membrane proteins were prepared. Ceramide hydrolytic activity was determined by incubating 50 μg of membrane proteins with [3H]C-6 ceramide as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Data represent means ± S.D. (n = 3–4). * denotes significant difference from CEL(+/+) mice at p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of CEL on chylomicron assembly and secretion was further examined in differentiated Caco-2 cells grown on polycarbonate Transwell membranes. Micelles containing 50 μm [14C]cholesterol, 30 μmmonoolein, 1.6 mm oleic acid, and 1 mmtaurocholate suspended in serum-free media were incubated on the apical surface of the cells in the presence or absence of bacterial SMase with or without CEL. Transport was monitored by the appearance of radiolabel in the basolateral media. Secreted lipoproteins were then fractionated by differential gradient ultracenrifugation to separate chylomicrons from higher density particles. Consistent with results reported by Luchoomun and Hussain (39Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19565-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the incubation of differentiated Caco-2 cells with oleic acid-supplemented medium resulted in the secretion of large chylomicron-sized lipoproteins. Incubation of Caco-2 cells with the micellar substrate in the presence or absence of CEL had no effect on the total amount of cholesterol secreted into the basolateral media (Fig. 5A). However, the amount of micellar derived [14C]cholesterol secreted into the basolateral media as the low density large chylomicron fractions was found to be increased in the incubations containing CEL (Fig.5B). In contrast, generation of endogenous ceramide in Caco2 cells by incubation with bacterial SMase decreased the amount of micelle-derived [14C]cholesterol found in the larger chylomicron-like particles (Fig. 5B) without significant effect on the total amount of [14C]cholesterol secreted into the basolateral media (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the addition of CEL not only alleviated the SMase inhibition of large chylomicron secretion, but the amount of [14C]cholesterol in the chylomicron fraction was also higher in incubations containing both CEL and SMase than in control cells incubated without these proteins or with only CEL (Fig.5B). Lipid absorption occurs predominantly in the proximal part of the intestine (38Sylven C. Nordstrom C. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1970; 5: 57-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and continues into the distal intestine after a high fat load (40Lin H.C. Zhao X.T. Wang L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G62-G67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, CEL secreted by the pancreas is also present in absorptive cells throughout the small intestine and is especially prominent in the proximal gut (41Poorkhalkali N. Lidmer A.S. Lundberg L.G. Dalrymple M.A. Gibson Y. Taylor L. Temperley S. Stromqvist M. Helander H.F. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although this CEL localization suggests its possible involvement in dietary lipid absorption and transport, its precise role in the lipid absorption process has not been defined. This study identified a novel physiologic role of CEL in dictating the type of lipoproteins produced by the intestine. We used CEL-null mice to demonstrate that the lack of a functional CEL gene resulted in diminished production of large sized chylomicrons and the concomitant increase in the amount of smaller VLDL sized intestinal lipoproteins after lipid infusion in vivo. The lack of CEL in the CEL(−/−) mice may either directly result in defective lipid processing in the intestine or alternatively delaying lipid absorption to the distal portion of the intestine where the smaller sized VLDL may be produced. Although we cannot distinguish these possibilities in the current study, previous studies indicated that lipoproteins secreted by distal intestine were either larger (42Wu A.L. Bennett Clark S. Holt P.R. J. Clin. Nutr. 1980; 33: 582-589Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or the same size (43Sabesin S.M. Holt P.R. Clark S.B. Lipids. 1975; 10: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as chylomicrons secreted by the proximal intestine. Therefore, it seems likely that CEL directly influences lipoprotein assembly and secretion in the proximal intestine and dictates the type of lipoproteins being produced. The in vitro cell culture experiments showing that addition of CEL increases the production of large sized chylomicron-like particles by Caco-2 cells are supportive of this hypothesis. Our current study also showed reduced ceramide hydrolytic activity in the proximal intestine of CEL(−/−) mice. This observation suggests that CEL may promote chylomicron production through ceramide hydrolysis. The importance of sphingomyelin and its metabolic product ceramide in controlling lipid trafficking in mammalian cells is well documented in the literature. Previously, Field and colleagues (44Field F.J. Born E. Mathur S.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2651-2660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Field F.J. Born E. Mathur S.N. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 348-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that cholesterol uptake by enterocytes is a two-step process in which the first step requires micellar cholesterol from the apical side embedding into the plasma membrane of the enterocytes. The membrane-bound cholesterol is then transported to endoplasmic reticulum where lipoprotein assembly occurs (44Field F.J. Born E. Mathur S.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2651-2660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Field F.J. Born E. Mathur S.N. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 348-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of cholesterol that can be accommodated in plasma membrane is strongly correlated with its sphingomyelin content, and influx of membrane cholesterol into the cell interior requires hydrolysis of the membrane sphingomyelin (46Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar,47Gupta A.K. Rudney H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, cell culture studies showed that the rate of exogenous cholesterol uptake by intestinal cells decreased when SMase was added to the culture media (37Chen H. Born E. Mathur S.N. Johlin F.C. Field F.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although SMase also decreased the amount of triacylglycerol secreted to the basolateral media, the amount of cholesterol and phospholipid secreted into the basolateral media was not affected by SMase treatment (36Field F.J. Chen H. Born E. Dixon B. Mathur S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2609-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 37Chen H. Born E. Mathur S.N. Johlin F.C. Field F.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Analysis of the lipoprotein composition data reported in these studies revealed that SMase may affect the secretion of larger sized chylomicrons with minimal effect on the secretion of smaller size VLDL. The SMase-induced alteration in intestinal cholesterol transport was attributed to the ability of the digestion product, ceramide, to inhibit basolateral secretion of intestinal lipoproteins (36Field F.J. Chen H. Born E. Dixon B. Mathur S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2609-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism by which ceramide inhibits chylomicron production is unknown at the present time, it is likely that the excess ceramide generated during cholesterol transport promotes Golgi disassembly and interrupts the transport of pre-chylomicron transport vesicles to this organelle. The previous in vitro cell culture experiments cited above were conducted in the absence of other pancreatic enzymes. In a physiological setting, pancreatic enzymes including CEL are secreted into the pancreatic juice and are present in the intestinal lumen. The CEL can interact with heparin-like molecules on the surface of enterocytes (12Bosner M.S. Gulick T. Riley D.J.S. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7438-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and be taken up into the cell interior (15Huang Y. Hui D.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2029-2037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Gallo L.L. Chiang Y. Vahouny G.V. Treadwell C.R. J.

The presence of CEL may alleviate ceramide inhibition of intracellular lipid trafficking and promote chylomicron production. Thus, SMase hydrolysis of membrane sphingomyelin, along with CEL hydrolysis of ceramide, are two important processes in the intracellular lipid transport process that are required for the production of large chylomicrons in the intestine. The observed synergism between SMase and CEL in promoting large chylomicron secretion by Caco-2 cells in culture is supportive of this hypothesis. A schematic diagram showing the participation of both SMase and CEL in intestinal lipid transport and lipoprotein assembly is presented in Fig. 6. We hypothesize that ceramide generated as a result of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, by either luminal or cytoplasmic SMase (37Chen H. Born E. Mathur S.N. Johlin F.C. Field F.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 51Duan R.D. Nyberg L. Nillson A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), can be further hydrolyzed by CEL in the lumen or endocytosed into the cell interior (15Huang Y. Hui D.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2029-2037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Gallo L.L. Chiang Y. Vahouny G.V. Treadwell C.R. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 537-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Lechene de la Porte P. Abouakil N. Lafont H. Lombardo D. Biochim. Biophys.

The hydrolysis of this SMase-generated metabolic product is necessary for proper lipid trafficking through the Golgi and the assembly and secretion of large sized chylomicrons. It is important to note that ceramide hydrolytic activity in CEL(−/−) mice decreased by ∼50% only in the proximal intestine, with little or no change in the distal gut. These results, which are consistent with results reported by others (52Duan R.D. Cheng Y. Yang L. Ohlsson L. Nilsson A. Lipids. 2001; 36: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), indicated the presence of additional enzyme(s) in the intestine capable of ceramide hydrolysis. However, the intestinal ceramidase is apparently unable to compensate for the lack of CEL in promoting chylomicron assembly and secretion in the CEL(−/−) mice. It is possible that differences in anatomic location of the two enzymes in the intestine (52Duan R.D. Cheng Y. Yang L. Ohlsson L. Nilsson A. Lipids. 2001; 36: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) may account for the inability of the ceramidase to replace CEL in mediating large chylomicron production. It is also possible that the remaining ceramidase activity in the proximal intestine of CEL(−/−) mice is insufficient to support the assembly and secretion of large chylomicrons after lipid infusion. The differentiation of these two possibilities will require additional experimentation with the generation of tissue-specific ceramidase overexpression transgenic mice. The participation of CEL in chylomicron production may be of clinical importance in determining the relationship between dietary lipid transport and risk of atherosclerosis and obesity. Previous studies using in vitro generated lipoproteins with sizes comparable with large chylomicrons (Sf >400) and the smaller VLDL (Sf = 20 = 400) showed that the chylomicrons are cleared from circulation by the liver more rapidly than the smaller sized VLDL (53Quartfordt S.H. Goodman D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 116: 383-385Google Scholar, 54Chajek-Shaul T. Eisenberg S. Oschry Y. Olivercrona T. J.

Mortimer B.C. Redgrave T.G. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2696-2705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The delayed hepatic clearance of smaller postprandial lipoproteins may promote obesity due to increase transport of the dietary fat to adipose tissues. The smaller sized VLDL are also more likely to penetrate the arterial wall. The VLDL trapped within the subendothelial space may promote atherogenesis (57Mamo J.C. Proctor S.D. Smith D. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 141: 63-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, CEL in the gastrointestinal tract may protect against these adverse effects by promoting the formation of large chylomicrons in response to fat feeding. Additional studies comparing diet-induced obesity and atherosclerosis in CEL(+/+) and CEL(−/−) mice are warranted.

Here we report that an editing reaction within the ndhB transcript (encoding a plastid NAD(P)H dehydrogenase subunit) is strictly dependent on active photosynthesis. Employing non-photosynthetic mutants, we show that in the absence of photosynthesis, the site remains unedited, whereas it is fully edited when the photosynthetic apparatus is intact. Moreover, the site also remains unedited during the etiolated stage of seedling development, suggesting that two different NdhB proteins are synthesized under photosynthetic versus non-photosynthetic conditions.

RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process changing individual nucleotides in plant organellar transcripts by pyrimidine transitions. C-to-U conversions are the predominantly found modifications in both mitochondria and plastids of vascular plants (for review see Refs.1Maier R.M. Zeltz P. Kössel H. Bonnard G. Gualberto J.M.

The vast majority of editing sites are located within coding regions and are functionally significant in that the editing results in changes of the coding properties of the affected triplets. Typically, these alterations result in the restoration of phylogenetically conserved amino acid residues. For this reason, editing is generally viewed as a repair mechanism acting at the transcript level and restoring information that had been negatively affected by mutations in the DNA. Neutral evolution models have been developed to explain the origin of plant organellar RNA editing in the absence of an initial selective advantage (4Covello P.S. Gray M.W. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 265-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In plastids of higher plants, the changes introduced into mRNAs by editing are restricted to conversions from C to U (5Hoch B. Maier R.M. Appel K. Igloi G.L. Kössel H.

Compared with the high RNA editing frequency in plant mitochondria (441 sites in Arabidopsis thaliana) (7Giegé P. Brennicke A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), relatively few editing sites are encoded in the plastid genome (25 sites in maize) (8Maier R.M. Neckermann K. Igloi G.L. Kössel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 614-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In addition to changing the coding properties of internal triplets in plastid messenger RNAs (9Maier R.M. Hoch B. Zeltz P. Kössel H. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar), editing can also be involved in the creation of chloroplast reading frames by introducing initiator codons by editing an ACG to an AUG start codon (5Hoch B. Maier R.M. Appel K. Igloi G.L. Kössel H. Nature. 1991; 353: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 6Kudla J. Igloi G.L. Metzlaff M. Hagemann R. Kössel H.

The restoration of conserved amino acids by plastid RNA editing has suggested that faithful editing is important for proper protein function in plastids. Transgenic experiments employing chloroplast transformation have demonstrated that RNA editing is an essential processing step in the generation of mature mRNAs (11Bock R. Kössel H. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The chloroplast ndhB gene encodes a subunit of a plastid NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, a multiprotein complex that has been implicated in chlororespiration, cyclic electron flow around photosystem I and photoprotection (12Burrows P.A.

The tobacco chloroplast ndhBmRNA is highly edited and contains as many as nine RNA editing sites (17Freyer R. Lopez C. Maier R.M. Martin M. Sabater B. Kössel H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which is roughly one third of the total number of editing sites encoded in the tobacco plastid genome (18Hirose T. Kusumegi T. Tsudzuki T. Sugiura M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have recently established that RNA editing at a specific site in the ndhBtranscript is dependent on plastid function and is blocked in the absence of active plastid protein synthesis (19Karcher D. Bock R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we have tested the dependence of ndhB editing on a key metabolic process in chloroplasts, photosynthesis. Using a set of photosynthetic mutants generated by plastid transformation, we show that although photosynthetic activity is not required for RNA editing to occur at most sites in the ndhB transcript, mutants defective in the light reactions of photosynthesis do not edit a single site in thendhB mRNA. The site also remains unedited in etiolated seedlings, thus resulting in the production of an NdhB protein differing in a single amino acid position from the NdhB protein in green leaves. These data establish an unexpected link among photosynthesis, light-induced chloroplast development, and RNA editing. Sterile tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacumcv. Petit Havana) were grown on agar-solidified Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30 g/liter of sucrose (20Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 493-497Crossref Scopus (54648) Google Scholar). A photosystem I-deficient tobacco mutant was constructed earlier by targeted deletion of theycf3 reading frame (21Ruf S. Kössel H. Bock R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), a mutant lacking the cytochromeb 6 f complex was obtained by knockout of the petN gene (22Hager M. Biehler K. Illerhaus J. Ruf S. Bock R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). An ATP synthase-free mutant was generated by targeted deletion of the chloroplastatpB operon. Construction details will be described elsewhere. 1M. Hager and R. Bock, manuscript in preparation. Mutant plants were kept at 6 μE2(low light conditions) or 60 μE (standard light conditions). A list of oligonucleotides used is indicated as follows: nb0, TGCTTCTCTTCGATGGAAG; nb2, GGCGGAACAGATCTACTAATTC; nb10, CAGCTACTCTAGGGGGAATG; P13, TTTTGGATCCTATACATTTGTGTATTGATA; P14, TTTTTCTAGAATATACCAAGAAAGATGTAC; P15, TTTTGGATCCAATTGAAATTCCTGGGGAGT; P16, TTTTTCTAGACGCTCATATTCATTACCGTA; and P19, TTTTGGATCCTTTGATGAGAAATAAAAAGG. Total plant DNA was extracted according to a rapid minipreparation procedure published previously (23Doyle J.J. Doyle J.L. Focus. 1990; 12: 13-15Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated with a phenol/guanidinium isothiocyanate-based extraction reagent (peqGOLD TriFastTM, PEQLAB, Erlangen, Germany) according to the instructions by the manufacturer. Total cellular RNA from wild-type and mutant plants was electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels, blotted to nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and hybridized to an ndhB-specific probe generated by PCR amplification of tobacco cDNA with primer pair nb10/P19. Total RNA treated with RNase-free DNase I was reverse transcribed at 42 °C with Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). DNA and cDNA samples were amplified by standard PCR protocols (45 s at 94 °C, 1.5 min at 55–58 °C, 1.5 min at 72 °C, 30 or 40 cycles) in a gradient thermal cycler. Gel-purified PCR products were sequenced directly either by a modified T7-DNA polymerase-sequencing protocol using radiolabeled dATP and the detergent Nonidet P-40 (24Bachmann B. Lüke W. Hunsmann G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) or by cycle sequencing with fluorescence-labeled dideoxy chain terminators. Oligonucleotides nb0, nb2, P13, P15, and P16 were used as primers to sequence the ndhB regions containing the nine RNA editing sites. We have recently shown that the treatment of plants with prokaryotic translational inhibitors and temperature-induced loss of chloroplast ribosomes result in the complete loss of plastid RNA editing activity at a single site within the ndhB transcript (19Karcher D. Bock R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Inhibition of plastid protein biosynthesis has a number of secondary consequences including a defective photosynthetic apparatus because of a depletion of plastid-encoded subunits of thylakoid protein complexes, reduced plastid transcription because of inhibited expression of the plastid-encoded Escherichia coli-like RNA polymerase, and lack of a number of plastid-encoded gene products not related to photosynthesis including, for example, an acetyl coenzyme A-carboxylase subunit encoded by the accD gene and a protease subunit encoded by the clpP gene. To distinguish among these possibilities, we first set out to analyze ndhB editing in the absence of active photosynthesis. The development of technologies to transform tobacco plastids (25Svab Z. Maliga P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) has made feasible the generation of non-photosynthetic mutants by reverse genetics. The active homologous recombination system present in plastids facilitates the targeted inactivation of plastid-encoded genes. We have recently generated a number of such chloroplast gene knockout mutants, some of which revealed novel photosynthesis-related proteins (21Ruf S. Kössel H. Bock R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 22Hager M. Biehler K. Illerhaus J. Ruf S. Bock R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). When grown under heterotrophic conditions (i.e. on sucrose-containing medium), plants develop normally even in the absence of any measurable net photosynthetic activity. Non-photosynthetic mutants lacking any of the three multiprotein complexes involved in electron transfer (photosystem II, cytochromeb 6 f complex, and photosystem I) bleach out under standard light conditions because of massive accumulation of photooxidative damage in the absence of an intact photosynthetic electron transport chain. However, under low light conditions, mutant plants are green and are practically indistinguishable from wild-type plants kept under identical conditions (21Ruf S. Kössel H. Bock R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 22Hager M. Biehler K. Illerhaus J. Ruf S. Bock R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We employed several non-photosynthetic mutants to comparatively analyze RNA editing in the plastid ndhBtranscript, such as a photosystem I-deficient mutant generated by the knockout of the plastid ycf3 reading frame (21Ruf S. Kössel H. Bock R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), a cytochrome b 6 f complex-deficient mutant produced by targeted inactivation of the petN(ycf6) gene (22Hager M. Biehler K. Illerhaus J. Ruf S. Bock R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and an ATP synthase-defective mutant lacking the plastid atpBoperon. 1M. Hager and R. Bock, manuscript in preparation. We included in our analyses both green plants obtained by growth under low light conditions and white plants grown under standard light conditions. PCR amplification of ndhB cDNA with a 5′ primer binding to a sequence in exon I and a 3′ primer binding to a sequence in exon II yielded products corresponding in size to spliced mRNAs, thus confirming amplification of cDNA and absence of the residual contaminating DNA (data not shown). Unexpectedly, direct sequencing of the amplified cDNA populations revealed that in all non-photosynthetic mutants, ndhB editing site III was virtually completely unedited (Fig. 1), whereas all other sites were found to be fully edited. Control sequencing of wild-type plants kept under identical conditions confirmed complete site III editing in wild-type tobacco as had been established in earlier reports (17Freyer R. Lopez C. Maier R.M. Martin M. Sabater B. Kössel H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Bock R. Hermann M. Kössel H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5052-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggesting that the absence of active photosynthesis is the cause of the lack of site III editing in the mutants. Although we had shown earlier that plastid-encoded genes are faithfully transcribed and translated in non-photosynthetic mutants generated by plastid gene knockouts (21Ruf S. Kössel H. Bock R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), it was important to establish that the ndhB mRNAs are equally stable in the wild type and in the transplastomic non-photosynthetic mutants. As mRNA editing is a post-transcriptional process, dramatically decreased mRNA stability theoretically could result in rapid mRNA decay after transcription and thus could account for the lack of site III editing in the mutants if one additionally assumes that the editing reaction at site III is significantly slower than the editing reactions at all other ndhB sites. Comparative RNA gel blot analysis of ndhB transcripts in the wild-type and ΔpetN and ΔatpB plants revealed no significant differences in ndhB transcript patterns and mRNA accumulation levels (Fig.2), demonstrating that the absence of active photosynthesis in the transplastomic knockout plants does not affect ndhB transcription or mRNA stability. Having established that ndhB site III editing is critically dependent on active photosynthesis, we were interested to explore the biological significance of this finding. The most important non-photosynthetic stage during plant development is the early seedling stage after seed germination when the plant grows inside the soil and is not yet exposed to light. During this etiolated seedling phase, plastids are present in a predifferentiated form termed etioplasts, which upon exposure to light are converted rapidly into photosynthesis-performing chloroplasts. This developmental switch from plant development in the dark (skotomorphogenesis) to growth in the light (photomorphogenesis) is accompanied by rapid changes in gene expression patterns (27Mustilli A.C. Bowler C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the plastid NAD(P)H oxidoreductase complex and hence the NdhB protein appears to serve important functions during both skotomorphogenesis and photomorphogenesis, because it is not only present in green chloroplasts but accumulates to even higher levels in etioplasts (28Guéra A. de Nova P.G. Sabater B. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When we comparatively analyzed ndhB RNA editing in etiolated seedlings and in green seedlings of maize (Zea mays), we found editing site III to be fully edited in green seedlings but essentially unedited in etiolated seedlings (Fig.3). RNA editing at site III changes a genomically encoded serine codon into a leucine codon. Hence, the NAD(P)H oxidoreductase complexes in etioplasts and chloroplasts differ in the identity of a single amino acid residue within their NdhB subunit in which a hydrophilic serine residue is present during skotomorphogenesis, and a (hydrophobic) leucine is present during photomorphogenesis. In this study, we have established a first case in which RNA editing appears to be employed for gene regulation in plant development. Editing at a single site in the plastid ndhBtranscript is only observed under conditions of active photosynthesis, resulting in the production of two different proteins from one and the same gene in a developmental stage-specific fashion, a serine-containing NdhB protein during skotomorphogenesis and a leucine-containing protein during photomorphogenesis. This editing-mediated developmental switch in the NdhB amino acid sequence is unlikely to be directly induced by light. Instead, our finding thatndhB mRNA unedited at site III is present in all non-photosynthetic mutants (Fig. 1) suggests that at the onset of photomorphogenesis, light induces synthesis of an active photosynthetic apparatus that in turn induces editing of site III in thendhB mRNA, thus synthesis of the leucine-containing NdhB protein. Two possibilities can be envisaged on how photosynthesis inducesndhB site III editing, (i) a direct involvement of photosynthetic electron transport in the editing reaction atndhB site III or (ii) a more indirect role for photosynthesis in RNA editing mediated by one of the reaction products of photosynthesis, such as reduced ferredoxin, NADPH2, ATP, molecular oxygen, or sugar. Alternatively, a lack of site III editing under non-photosynthetic conditions could reflect redox regulation of the site-specific (nuclear) factor for ndhB site III editing. Plastid RNA editing sites are known to be specifically recognized by site-specific trans-acting factors (29Chaudhuri S. Carrer H. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2951-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 30Bock R. Koop H.-U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3282-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that are likely to be encoded in the nuclear genome. It is well established that several nuclear genes are controlled by redox signals originating in the chloroplast, and the redox state of the plastoquinone pool is one of the redox signals implicated in plastid-nuclear communication (31Escoubas J.M. Lomas M. LaRoche J. Falkowski P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10237-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 32Maxwell D.P. Laudenbach D.E. Hunter N.P.A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 33Karpinski S. Escobar C. Karpinska B. Creissen G. Mullineaux P.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems conceivable that redox regulation could couple ndhB site III editing with photosynthesis through switching on and off the synthesis of a nuclear specificity factor for editing of this site. The developmental switch in the NdhB amino acid sequence is significant in that the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase is expressed and accumulates at the protein level in both green and etiolated tissue (28Guéra A. de Nova P.G. Sabater B. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although presently the different functions of the plastid NADP(H) complexes in etiolated versus green seedlings are not yet exactly defined, recent work has suggested that in chloroplasts the complex is involved in cyclic photosynthetic electron transport (14Shikanai T. Endo T. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. Asada K. Yokota A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9705-9709Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 34Kubicki A. Funk E. Westhoff P. Steinmüller K. Planta. 1996; 199: 276-281Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and chlororespiration (12Burrows P.A. Sazanov L.A. Svab Z. Maliga P. Nixon P.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 13Kofer W. Koop H.-U. Wanner G. Steinmüller K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas in etioplasts, the complex provides protection against photooxidative stress during early chloroplast biogenesis (16Casano L.M. Zapata J.M. Martin M. Sabater B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 942-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and also may contribute to the generation of a proton gradient required for the insertion of proteins into (pro)thylakoidal membranes (35Fischer M. Funk E. Steinmüller K. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1997; 52: 481-486Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy in this respect that recently two functionally distinct NAD(P)H dehydrogenases were shown to operate in cyanobacteria (36Ohkawa H. Pakrasi H.B. Ogawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31630-31634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It may be tempting to speculate that in higher plants differential RNA editing could create functionally different forms of the plastid NAD(P)H dehydrogenase. However, more data on the physiological functions of the plastid NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex are needed to be able to directly determine the functional differences between the leucine-containing NdhB protein made from edited RNA in the light and the serine-containing protein made from unedited RNA in the dark. The discovery that RNA editing can be qualitatively regulated by physiological factors and/or environmental cues also could suggest that the frequency in plant cell organelles is higher than currently known. Usually RNAs extracted from green leaf material are used for the experimental identification of editing sites now raising the possibility that some developmentally regulated editing events that do not occur in green leaf tissue have gone undetected thus far. In this respect, it is interesting to note that ndhB editing site III was reported not to undergo RNA editing in pea and bean chloroplasts (37Freyer R. Kiefer-Meyer M.-C. Kössel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6285-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Future experiments will determine whether this site is generally not edited in legumes or whether editing will occur under certain developmental or environmental conditions. Our finding that the amino acid sequence of a plastid protein can be developmentally regulated by RNA editing suggests for the first time a functional role for this seemingly unnecessary extra step in plant organellar gene expression. In addition, from an evolutionary point of view, this or a similar scenario could explain the origin of RNA editing in plants. Gene regulation by RNA editing and/or generation of two different proteins from one and the same gene by differential RNA editing might have provided the initial selective advantage leading to fixation and further spreading of RNA editing in mitochondria and chloroplasts (4Covello P.S. Gray M.W. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 265-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In summary, we have provided evidence that in the dicotyledonous plant tobacco as well as in the monocotyledonous plant maize, i) active photosynthesis is required for RNA editing at a specific site, and (ii) differential editing causes a developmental switch in the amino acid sequence of a plastid protein, which in turn may regulate the structure and/or activity of a plastid multiprotein complex. These data establish an unexpected link among photosynthesis, light-induced chloroplast development, and RNA editing.

In this regulation of energy homeostasis, the creatine kinase (CK) circuit for high energy phosphoryl transfer between ATP and phosphocreatine plays an important role. We earlier established a functional connection between the activity of the CK system and Ca2+ homeostasis during depolarization and contractile activity of muscle. Here, we show how CK activity is coupled to the kinetics of spontaneous and electrically induced Ca2+ transients in the sarcoplasm of myotubes. Using the UV ratiometric Ca2+ probe Indo-1 and video-rate confocal microscopy in CK-proficient and -deficient cultured cells, we found that spontaneous and electrically induced transients were dependent on ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pumps, extracellular calcium, and functional mitochondria in both cell types. However, at increasing sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load (induced by electrical stimulation at 0.1, 1, and 10 Hz), the Ca2+removal rate and the amount of Ca2+ released per transient were gradually reduced in CK-deficient (but not wild-type) myotubes. We conclude that the CK/phosphocreatine circuit is essential for efficient delivery of ATP to the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pumps and thereby directly influences sarcoplasmic reticulum refilling and the kinetics of the sarcoplasmic Ca2+ signals.

Ionic Ca2+ regulates numerous cellular processes such as contraction, synaptic transmission, gene expression, metabolism, and cell death (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4423) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, Ca2+ is a key regulator of contractile activity and glycolytic (activation of phosphorylase) and mitochondrial (activation of Ca2+-sensitive dehydrogenases) ATP production (2Ebashi S.

In adult muscle, two CK subunits are expressed: cytosolic M-CK, which is active as a muscle-muscle isoform dimer, and ScCKmit, which is present as inactive homodimeric and active homo-octameric molecules in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. In newborn or embryonic muscle, expression of also BB- or BM-CK is seen, but expression of these proteins gradually decreases when the muscle matures. The presence of CK at the sarcomeric M- and I-bands and at the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane is important for regenerating adequate amounts of ATP for the myosin ATPase (contraction) and the SERCA pump (Ca2+ homeostasis) (7Wegmann G. Zanolla E. Eppenberger H.M. Wallimann T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 420-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Korge P. Campbell K.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C357-C366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CK in mitochondrial protein complexes, together with the voltage-dependent anion channel and the adenine nucleotide transporter, is important in regulating intramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratios (9Kay L. Nicolay K. Wieringa B. Saks V. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6937-6944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we observed that cellular calcium homeostasis in primary cultures of CK-deficient myotubes (referred to as CK−/−; M-CK−/− × ScCKmit−/−) is abnormal. It has been speculated that these alterations could be responsible for the anomalous contractile properties of these muscles in vivo(10Steeghs K. Benders A. Oerlemans F. de Haan A. Heerschap A.

Indeed, various studies point to a direct involvement of CK in optimization of SERCA function and calcium homeostasis in skeletal muscle (8Korge P. Campbell K.B. Am. J.

To obtain a better understanding of this connection and its coupling to different Ca2+ signaling pathways, we need a more detailed picture of amplitude and frequency behavior of Ca2+transients in CK-deficient muscles. Here, we studied mechanistic and kinetic aspects of Ca2+ homeostasis in immortalized myotubes using the UV ratiometric probe Indo-1 and video-rate confocal microscopy. CK-proficient and -deficient immortalized cell lines were derived from wild-type and CK−/− mice crossed to H-2Kb-tsA58 transgenic mice (24Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Tanaka Y. Yannoutsos N.

By analysis of spontaneous and electrically induced sarcoplasmic Ca2+ transients, we found that in contrast to wild-type myotubes, CK-deficient myotubes displayed a gradual reduction of the Ca2+ removal rate and SR refilling with increasing stimulation intensity. We conclude that the CK/phosphocreatine circuit is essential for efficient SERCA-mediated refilling of the SR and thus for the shaping of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ signals. The generation of immortalized cell lines, the growth of myotubes, and culture conditions were as described by Morgan et al. (26Morgan J.E. Beauchamp J.R. Pagel C.N. Peckham M. Ataliotis P. Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Farmer K. Partridge T.A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 486-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We derived immortalized cell lines from wild-type and CK−/−mice.2 Myoblasts were cultured at low density at permissive temperature (33 °C, 10% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Integro, Zaandam, The Netherlands), 2% chicken embryo extract (Invitrogen), and 20 units/ml murine recombinant interferon-γ (Invitrogen). For differentiation at nonpermissive temperature (37 °C, 5% CO2), cells were cultured at high density on Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany)-coated plastic Aclar coverslips (Allied-Signal, Pottsville, PA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% horse serum (Invitrogen) in the presence of 20 mm creatine (Sigma, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands), which improves myoblast fusion characteristics in both wild-type and CK-deficient cell lines.2 Myotubes (at 5 days of differentiation) were washed with physiological salt solution (125 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). For Ca2+ recordings, myotubes were exposed for 30 min at 37 °C to 10 μm Indo-1/AM in the presence of 0.025% (w/v) Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Leiden, The Netherlands) in physiological salt solution, washed twice, and allowed to equilibrate for 15 min. Use of the ratiometric Ca2+ probe Indo-1 in myotubes has been described earlier (27Cognard C. Constantin B. Rivet Bastide M. Raymond G. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Jaimovich E. Rojas E. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and largely circumvents problems associated with non-ratiometric Ca2+probes (like dye compartmentalization, leakage, and photobleaching). After an additional wash to remove residual traces of Indo-1/AM, coverslips were put in a Leiden chamber (volume of 700 μl) (29Ince C. van Dissel J.T. Diesselhoff M.M. Pfluegers Arch. 1985; 403: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and placed on a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope attached to an OZ confocal laser scanning microscope (Noran Instruments, Naarden, The Netherlands). Indo-1 was excited at 351 nm using a modified high power argon ion laser (Coherent Enterprise, Santa Clara, CA). Indo-1 emission light was collected using a Nikon ×40 water immersion objective (NA1.2) with high UV transmission, separated by a 455 DCLP dichroic mirror, and quantified at 405 ± 45 and 485 ± 45 nm using photomultipliers. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, no confocal slit was used. This maximized the confocal detection volume (section thickness of ∼5–8 μm) (30Koopman W.J.H. Scheenen W. Errington R.J. Willems P.

J. 2001; 81: 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and enabled us to run the laser at minimal levels (output of 15 milliwatts, equivalent to 28 microwatts at the back of the objective lens). Basal ratio signals were stable, and no UV-induced deterioration in cell viability was observed during experiments. In long experiments (>5 min), the UV laser and recordings were stopped between measurements to prevent UV damage. The OZ hardware was controlled by Intervision Version 1.5 acquisition software (Noran Instruments) running under IRIX 6.5 on an Indy workstation (Silicon Graphics Inc., Mountain View, CA) equipped with 256-Mb internal memory. Before recording images, a custom memory-management script was used to ensure optimal timing efficiency. When image storage was not required, raw Indo-1 ratio signals were visualized in real-time using a software plotting application and successively stored in ASCII format. Emission signals were separately background-corrected before calculating ratio signals (405/485 nm). Inhibitors (Sigma) were either directly dissolved in physiological salt solution or diluted from a concentrated stock solution in Me2SO and used at the concentrations indicated (final Me2SO concentrations never exceeded 0.1% (v/v)). Chemical depolarization was performed using physiological salt solution containing 125 mm KCl. To generate Ca2+-free medium, CaCl2 was omitted, and 500 μm EGTA was added. All solutions were administered to the Leiden chamber using a custom-made superfusion setup (1.5 ml/min), except for thapsigargin (pipetted). Temperature was held constant by a TC-102 temperature controller (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY). For electrical stimulation, two platinum electrodes were fixed to both sides of the chamber and connected to a Grass SD9 stimulator. Myotubes were stimulated (16 V over 10 ms) at frequencies indicated below. For quantitative analysis, ratio signals were normalized relative to the basal resting Indo-1 ratio. We used arbitrary units for these normalized Indo-1 ratios (30Koopman W.J.H. Scheenen W. Errington R.J. Willems P. Bindels R.J.M. Roubos E.W. Jenks B.G. Biophys.

Images were analyzed using Noran 2D software (Noran Instruments) and Image Pro Plus 4.1 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Numerical data obtained from multiple recordings are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless stated otherwise. Statistical significance (tested using a t test) is expressed as p < 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001. During curve fitting, we used Pearson’s correlation coefficient R(or product moment correlation coefficient) as an estimate of the population correlation coefficient. Values of −1 and +1 indicate a perfect linear relationship between the two variables. The coefficient of determination (R 2) was used to express the proportion of the total variation that is explained by the regression. In analogy to R, if R 2 = ±1, the total variation in the y-variable can be explained in terms of the regression curve. After 3–5 days of differentiation, both wild-type and CK-deficient (CK−/−) myotubes displayed periods of spontaneous contractions in culture, separated by silent periods. Video-rate (30 Hz) confocal microscopy of myotubes loaded with Indo-1 revealed, as anticipated, that these contractions were paralleled by transient rises in the [Ca2+]stransients. At the subcellular level, these [Ca2+]s transients appeared as unidirectional waves with a sharp front. Fig.1 A displays a typical example of such a wave recorded from a wild-type myotube (but this figure is representative of both cell types). Three consecutive Indo-1 ratio images (each 479 × 512 pixels, corresponding to 90.3 × 96.6 μm) taken from a 5-s recording are shown. For optimal visualization, the images taken at both Indo-1 emission wavelengths were first de-blurred using deconvolution software (Noran 2D analysis) and then background-corrected before ratios were calculated. Next, the resulting Indo-1 ratio signal was height-coded after color conversion using a linear look-up table. Analysis of the figure revealed that the [Ca2+]s wave progressed about 550 pixels (∼100 μm) within 100 ms, roughly equaling a wave speed of 1000 μm/s (experiment performed at room temperature). The change in average [Ca2+]s was investigated by analyzing a region of interest (ROI) that encompassed the entire myotube. [Ca2+]s reached its maximum within 99 ms (three data points obtained from the images in Fig. 1 A), after which it rapidly declined to basal levels (Fig. 1 B). This [Ca2+]s decline was adequately described (in Fig. 1 B, R 2 was 0.997) by a monoexponential function (Y t = Y0 +Ce −t/μ), suggesting the involvement of one major removal process described by a single rate constant μ (31Lieste J.R. Koopman W.J. Reynen V.C. Scheenen W.J. Jenks B.G. Roubos E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25686-25694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We used this rate constant, which is inversely proportional to the rate of [Ca2+]s decline, as a quantitative readout of the sarcoplasmic Ca2+removal kinetics. For fitting the [Ca2+]sdecline, we applied the robust Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (32Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in Pascal: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1992Google Scholar). In the trace shown, the decay constant equaled 0.220 s. Because the residence time at maximal amplitude was only 33 ms (i.e.one data point), no attempt was made to quantify the amplitude of the [Ca2+]s transients. When recording full resolution images at 30 Hz, the size of the frame store memory limited total recording time to 5 s. To allow longer recordings, we disabled image collection, and stored only numerical data for different sarcoplasmic ROIs (Fig. 1 D). It was found that different sarcoplasmic ROIs within a single myotube exhibited identical [Ca2+]s kinetics (Fig. 1 E). This finding enabled random comparison of sarcoplasmic ROIs between different myotubes. Using this approach, we observed (n= 114, equally distributed between wild-type and CK−/−genotypes) that (i) [Ca2+]s transients occurred either continuously or as discrete bursts (Fig. 1 C, examples from wild-type myotubes); (ii) the amplitude and frequency of these transients were remarkably constant within the same myotube; and (iii) between different myotubes, the frequency was variable (ranging from <0.1 to 10 Hz) and increased with temperature (1.6 ± 0.1 Hz (n = 55) and 3.4 ± 0.1 Hz (n = 59) at 22 and 37 °C, respectively). No differences in distribution of the firing frequencies, firing pattern, and temperature sensitivity were found between wild-type and CK−/− myotubes. During the time course of the measurements (5 min of continuous recording at 30 Hz), no significant change in decay constant was observed (data not shown). This indicates that μ also is a reliable parameter for the quantification of [Ca2+]s kinetics during prolonged recordings. In mature skeletal muscle, depolarizations of the plasma membrane are sensed by the dihydropyridine receptor in the T-tubule membrane. This protein directly interacts with the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+release channel RyR in the SR membrane to promote the release of Ca2+ from the SR into the sarcoplasm (2Ebashi S. Endo M. Ohtsuki I. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as a Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 579-595Google Scholar). SERCA pumps in the SR membrane pump Ca2+ from the sarcoplasm back into the SR (41Guerini D. Carafoli E. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as a Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 249-278Google Scholar). Because the excitation-contraction coupling apparatus of skeletal muscle is known to develop over time (33Flucher B.E. Takekura H. Franzini Armstrong C. Dev. Biol. 1993; 160: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we analyzed the source of the Ca2+ during spontaneous activity in wild-type and CK−/− myotubes. For both preparations, a specific block of the SERCA pumps with thapsigargin (2 μm) did not lead to immediate cessation of the spontaneous [Ca2+]stransients. Indeed, it took ∼4 min until the spontaneous [Ca2+]s transients were extinguished (Fig.2 A, representative of 25 experiments in wild-type myotubes). On the other hand, thapsigargin immediately reduced (within 30 s after application) the Ca2+ removal rate and increased the interval between the [Ca2+]s transients (Fig. 2, B andC). In agreement with this finding, also the removal of extracellular Ca2+ did not result in immediate cessation of the spontaneous [Ca2+]s transients in either wild-type or CK−/− myotubes (Fig. 2 D, data from wild-type myotubes, total of eight wild-type and CK−/− genotypes analyzed). Importantly, in the myotube shown (in which the spontaneous [Ca2+]stransients occurred at a much higher frequency than in Fig.2 A), it took again ∼4 min for the [Ca2+]s transients to extinguish. The spontaneous [Ca2+]s transients reappeared, although at a somewhat lower frequency, when Ca2+ was re-added to the medium. To determine whether CK plays a role in the spontaneous [Ca2+]s transients, we compared the Ca2+ removal kinetics between wild-type and CK−/− myotubes that displayed [Ca2+]s transients of similar frequencies (3.1 ± 0.3 Hz (n = 23) and 3.6 ± 0.4 Hz (n = 17) for wild-type and CK−/−myotubes, respectively) measured at 37 °C. For analysis, one transient was randomly chosen from each myotube (using random numbers generated with Origin Pro 6.1). Next, the maximal amplitudes of the transients were temporally aligned to allow calculation of the average decline kinetics. Fig. 3 shows that the Ca2+ removal was significantly faster (indicated at the corresponding time points by asterisks) in wild-type myotubes (wild-type, μ = (0.051 ± 1.8) × 10−3 s and R 2 = 0.998; and CK−/−, μ = (0.094 ± 4.6) × 10−3 s and R 2 = 0.996). Taken together, the findings presented in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that CK is required for an optimal SERCA-mediated refill of the SR and that only little Ca2+ is extruded across the plasma membrane during spontaneous [Ca2+]s spiking. Given the results obtained with thapsigargin, we expect that the SR Ca2+store contains sufficient Ca2+ to maintain spontaneous Ca2+ release events for prolonged periods of time, even in the absence of functional SERCAs. To investigate the amount of Ca2+ present in the SR, we performed experiments in which we chemically depolarized wild-type and CK−/− myotubes by application of an isosmotic medium containing 125 mm KCl (Fig.4, A–C, wild-type myotubes). This high KCl medium induced a large [Ca2+]stransient that was independent of the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4, compare A and B). When extracellular Ca2+ was removed directly following KCl treatment, a second KCl application failed to induce a [Ca2+]s transient of the same amplitude (Fig.4 B; the area under the second transient (markedII) was reduced by 75%, whereas the duration was similar to that of the first transient (I): 33 s versus31 s). This indicates that during the first transient, Ca2+ was mainly extruded across the sarcolemma and not re-sequestered into the SR by SERCA pump action. The enlargedinset shows that the rising speed of the small second transient was markedly reduced, whereas the [Ca2+]s decay rate remained virtually unaltered. Fig. 4 C shows that the KCl-induced [Ca2+]s transient was fully restored within 10 min following re-addition of Ca2+ to the medium (same myotube as in Fig. 4 C). In summary, these data show that high KCl stimulates the extrusion of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane, leading to depletion of the SR Ca2+ store. Therefore, under these conditions, the removal process is entirely dominated by the action of the plasma membrane Ca2+extrusion mechanisms (i.e. plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase and/or Na+/Ca2+exchange). In Fig. 4 C, the KCl-induced transient was preceded by spontaneous [Ca2+]s transients. A qualitative comparison of the kinetic characteristics of these two types of [Ca2+]s signal revealed that, in general, the amplitude was lower, the duration was shorter, and the removal rate was more rapid for spontaneous transients. The decline in the KCl-induced [Ca2+]s transient was also monoexponential. In the typical trace shown, the Ca2+ removal rate was ∼200 times slower following KCl treatment compared with spontaneous transients, as reflected by an increase in the decay constant from 0.2 ± 0.030 s (spontaneous) to 38 ± 1.7 s (KCl). In addition, we compared the amounts of Ca2+ that were released during both types of [Ca2+]s transients. For this purpose, we calculated the area under the curve as a measure of the total amount of Ca2+ released into the sarcoplasm. We first set the basal [Ca2+]s signal of each normalized recording to zero by subtracting the value 1 from each data point. Subsequently, individual [Ca2+]stransients were integrated to obtain numerical values (arbitrary units·s). In doing so, we found that the relative amount of Ca2+ released during KCl treatment was 100 times larger than during a single spontaneous transient (15.16 versus0.152 arbitrary units·s). Occasionally, a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]s was observed upon application of KCl (wild-type, n = 3 of 12; and CK−/−,n = 6 of 14) (Fig. 4 C). This was the result of a fast burst of small [Ca2+]s transients superimposed on the rising phase of the large [Ca2+]s signal. To investigate the effects of CK deficiency on Ca2+ handling in KCl-induced [Ca2+]stransients, we compared Ca2+ removal kinetics between wild-type (n = 12) and CK−/− myotubes (n = 14). Automated exponential fitting was not possible for all experimental data sets due to the presence of noise. We therefore fitted a straight line to the steepest part of the decline phase of the transients (Fig. 4 A, Linear decay) and used the absolute slope of this fit as an approximation of the (linear) Ca2+ removal rate. The maximal Indo-1 ratio reached (R max) (Fig. 4 A) was used as a measure of the amplitude of the transient. Plotting the linear calcium removal rate as a function of R maxrevealed a positive correlation between these parameters in wild-type and CK−/− myotubes (Fig. 4 D). In both cell types, this correlation was linear (wild-type, Pearson'sR = 0.91; and CK−/−, R = 0.93). For both lines, the intercept differed not significantly from zero. If [Ca2+]s does not rise (i.e.if there are no observable chan"

In a screen for endogenous targets of methylation-mediated gene silencing, we identified a novel CpG island-associated gene, TMS1, which is aberrantly methylated and silenced in response to the ectopic expression of DNA methyltransferase-1. TMS1 functions in the regulation of apoptosis and is frequently methylated and silenced in human breast cancers. In this study, we characterized the methylation pattern and chromatin architecture of the TMS1 locus in normal fibroblasts and determined the changes associated with its progressive methylation. In normal fibroblasts expressing TMS1, the CpG island is defined by an unmethylated domain that is separated from densely methylated flanking DNA by distinct 5′ and 3′ boundaries. Analysis of the nucleoprotein architecture of the locus in intact nuclei revealed three DNase I-hypersensitive sites that map within the CpG island. Strikingly, two of these sites coincided with the 5′- and 3′-methylation boundaries. Methylation of the TMS1 CpG island was accompanied by loss of hypersensitive site formation, hypoacetylation of histones H3 and H4, and gene silencing. This altered chromatin structure was confined to the CpG island and occurred without significant changes in methylation, histone acetylation, or hypersensitive site formation at a fourth DNase I-hypersensitive site 2 kb downstream of the TMS1 CpG island. The data indicate that there are sites of protein binding and/or structural transitions that define the boundaries of the unmethylated CpG island in normal cells and that aberrant methylation overcomes these boundaries to direct a local change in chromatin structure, resulting in gene silencing.

Cytosine methylation is a post-replicative modification of DNA that plays an important role in epigenetic inheritance. In vertebrates, methylation occurs primarily at cytosines within the dinucleotide CpG. Both the distribution of CpG sites and their methylation status are non-random in the human genome, generating a pattern of DNA methylation that varies with respect to density across the chromosome. CpG sites occur relatively infrequently throughout much of the human genome, except in discreet regions of CpG-dense DNA known as CpG “islands.” These islands are ∼200–1000 bp in length and often coincide with the 5′-ends of genes. Accordingly, the identification of such regions in the human genome sequencing projects has been useful in gene prediction (1Ioshikhes I.P. Zhang M.Q. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Current estimates suggest that there are ∼29,000 CpG islands in the human genome (2Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. FitzHugh W. Funke R. Gage D. Harris K. Heaford A. Howland J. Kann L. Lehoczky J. LeVine R. McEwan P. McKernan K. Meldrim J. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17981) Google Scholar). Whereas non-CpG island DNA is generally methylated, most CpG islands remain methylation-free in both expressing and non-expressing tissues (3Bird A.

Specialized physiologic cases in which CpG islands are methylated include genes subject to parental imprinting and genes on the inactive X chromosome (5Mann J.R. Szabo P.E. Reed M.R. Singer-Sam J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2000; 10: 241-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6Jaenisch R. Beard C. Lee J. Marahrens Y. Panning B. Novartis Found.

Here methylation functions as part of an epigenetic mechanism ensuring the stable propagation of allele-specific gene repression. In human cancers, CpG island methylation occurs aberrantly and is associated with the inappropriate silencing of tumor suppressor genes and other genes that function in the suppression of the malignant phenotype. Methylation-mediated silencing contributes to malignant progression at several levels and has been implicated in the inactivation of genes involved in tumor suppression (e.g. Rb, VHL, and CDKN2A), the regulation of DNA repair and genome integrity (e.g. MLH1,MGMT, BRCA1), and the suppression of metastases (e.g. CDH1 and TIMP3) (reviewed in Refs. 7Baylin S.B.

Recent evidence suggests that aberrant methylation also contributes to human carcinogenesis by conferring resistance to cell death signals through the silencing of genes that promote apoptosis (10Katzenellenbogen R.A.

In each of these cases, aberrant methylation of promoter region CpG islands is associated with loss of gene expression in tumor-derived cell lines and primary tumors relative to normal somatic cells. That methylation plays a primary role in the silencing of these genes is supported by the fact that treatment with a demethylating agent such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine is sufficient to restore expression and, in many cases, gene function. At present, it is not known how or why particular CpG islands succumb to aberrant methylation in cancer cells, and the precise mechanism in which an unmethylated, actively transcribed gene progresses to a methylated and inactive state is unclear. One established consequence of CpG island methylation is transcriptional repression. Methylation of cytosine can affect gene expression directly, by interfering with the binding of transcription factors like E2F and AP-2 (14Campanero M.R. Armstrong M.I. Flemington E.K. Proc. Natl.

The accidental methylation of a CpG island during carcinogenesis could serve to re-direct the MBDs and chromatin remodeling machinery to newly methylated DNA, resulting in aberrant gene silencing.

In previous studies, we showed that the overexpression of DNMT1 results in the progressive de novo methylation of endogenous CpG island sequences (27Vertino P.M. Yen R.W. Gao J. Baylin S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4555-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 28Graff J.R. Herman J.G. Myohanen S. Baylin S.B. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22322-22329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Using this model, we recently identified a novel CpG island-associated gene, TMS1 (Target ofMethylation-induced Silencing), that is aberrantly methylated and silenced in response to DNMT1-driven methylation (13Conway K.E. McConnell B.B. Bowring C.E. Donald C.D. Warren S.T. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6236-6242PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies indicated that TMS1 is silenced in association with aberrant methylation in human breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors, implicating TMS1 as a putative tumor suppressor in breast cancer (13Conway K.E. McConnell B.B. Bowring C.E. Donald C.D. Warren S.T. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6236-6242PubMed Google Scholar). TMS1 encodes a caspase recruitment domain protein and functions as a positive mediator of apoptosis (29McConnell B.B. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6243-6247PubMed Google Scholar). TMS1 was independently identified (and named ASC) by Masumoto et al. (30Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) who showed that decreased expression of TMS1 results in reduced sensitivity to anticancer agents. Methylation-mediated silencing of TMS1thus may contribute to breast carcinogenesis by allowing cells to bypass apoptosis and may confer resistance to cancer chemotherapeutic agents or other genotoxic stress. In this study, we used bisulfite genomic sequencing, DNase I-hypersensitive site mapping and chromatin immunoprecipitation to characterize the methylation pattern and the chromatin architecture of the TMS1 locus in normal human fibroblasts, and to determine the changes associated with its progressive methylation in immortalized and DNMT1-overexpressing derivatives. We find that in normal fibroblasts, the TMS1 CpG island is comprised of an unmethylated domain with distinct 5′- and 3′-methylation boundaries. Three DNase I-hypersensitive (HS) sites mapped within the CpG island, with two coinciding almost precisely with the positions of the methylation boundaries. De novo methylation of the CpG island in DNMT1-overexpressing cells was accompanied by a loss of CpG island-specific HS formation, localized hypoacetylation of histones H3 and H4, and gene silencing. We propose that there are protein binding sites that demarcate the boundaries of TMS1CpG island in normal cells and that aberrant methylation overcomes these boundaries to direct a localized change in chromatin architecture, resulting in gene silencing. Normal diploid human fibroblasts (IMR90) and SV40 immortalized IMR90 cells (referred to as “90SV”) were obtained from the NIA (National Institutes on Aging) Cell Repository (AG02804C) and were maintained in EMEM with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. The generation of a 90SV derivative cell line stably overexpressing the human DNMT1 (HMT.1E1) has been reported (27Vertino P.M. Yen R.W. Gao J. Baylin S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4555-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). HMT.1E1 cells were maintained in EMEM plus 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and 400 μg/ml G418. HMT.1E1 cells were seeded in 75-cm2 flasks overnight and treated the next day with 100 ng/ml trichostatin A (TSA) (Sigma) or 500 nm 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. For the combined treatments, cells were treated with 500 nm5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine for 72 h and 100 ng/ml TSA was added for the last 24 h. Genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite as previously described (31Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar). For methylation-specific PCR, ∼50 ng of bisulfite-modified DNA was amplified by PCR under the following reaction conditions: 67 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 16.6 mmNH4SO4, 6.7 μm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6.7 mmMgCl2, and 1 μm of each primer in a 25-μl reaction. A hot start was performed (5 min, 95 °C) followed by the addition of 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and 35 cycles of PCR (95 °C, 30 s; 58 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s) with a final extension of 4 min at 72 °C. Primers were designed from the interpolated sequence after bisulfite conversion assuming DNA was either methylated or unmethylated at three CpG sites. Primers used for methylated reactions were 5′-TTG TAG CGG GGT GAG CGG C-3′ and 5′-AAC GTC CAT AAA CAA CAA CGC G-3′. Primers used for the unmethylated reactions were 5′-GGT TGT AGT GGG GTG AGT GGT-3′ and 5′-CAA AAC ATC CAT AAA CAA CAC A-3′. Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide/Tris borate-EDTA gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. For genomic sequencing, 50 ng of bisulfite-modified DNA was amplified by PCR using the same reaction conditions described above except that the annealing temperature was 55 °C and the final extension was increased to 10 min. Primers were designed to avoid potential methylation sites (e.g. CpG) such that both methylated and unmethylated DNA would be amplified equally. The resulting amplification pools were cloned into the pCR2 vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Eight to twelve individual subclones per PCR reaction were isolated and sequenced. Primer pairs used for bisulfite genomic sequencing were: A: 5′-GAA ATT GAA GTT TAG AGA GAT TTG-3′ and 5′-CCC TTA ATC CCC TCC CAC C-3′, B: 5′-TTG GTG TAA GTT TAG AGA TAA GT-3′ and 5′-ACC ATC TCC TAC AAA CCC ATA-3′, C: 5′-AAG TTG GTT AGT TTT TAT TTG GAG-3′ and 5′-CTT CAA AAA TTC CTC TAC AAA CC-3′, D: 5′-TTT TAT TGT ATG TGG GGT TTT GG-3′ and 5′-CTC TAC ACA TAC CAA CAA ACT AAA-3′, E: 5′-GGT ATG TGT AGA GTT TAG TTA TG-3′ and 5′-CAC TAC ACT CCA ATC TAA ATA AC-3′. Cells (1 × 107) were resuspended in nuclei isolation buffer (RBS) (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3 mm sucrose, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and swollen on ice for 10 min. This was followed by Dounce homogenization, and nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g. Nuclei were resuspended in RBS without Nonidet P-40 and immediately added to prepared aliquots of DNase I (Invitrogen) and 0.1 mmCaCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. As controls, nuclei were incubated in the presence of CaCl2 without DNase I (endogenous nuclease control) or in the absence of DNase I (nuclease-free reference). Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 10 μg/ml RNase A and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. DNA was then isolated by Proteinase K digestion, phenol:chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Ten micrograms of DNA was digested with HindIII and electrophoresed on a 25-cm, 1.0% agarose gel. The gel was transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized to a random-prime-labeled 423-bpHindIII-XbaI fragment anchored to the 3′HindIII site of the TMS1 locus. Blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and exposed to x-ray film (Biomax-MS, Kodak). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using antibodies specific for the acetylated isoforms of histone H4 and H3 in accordance with the protocol provided by the supplier (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). DNA fragments immunoprecipitated with anti-acetylated H3 or anti-acetylated H4 were analyzed by multiplex PCR using primers spanning HS1, HS2, HS3, or HS4 of the TMS1 locus in combination with primers specific for the β-actin promoter region. Multiplex PCR was carried out under the following reaction conditions: 67 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 16.6 mm NH4SO4, 6.7 μm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6.7 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm of each primer in a 25-μl reaction. A hot start was performed (5 min, 95 °C) followed by the addition of 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and 35 cycles of PCR (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s) with a final extension of 72 °C for 4 min. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. The ratio of intensities of the TMS1 product to β-actin product in each reaction was determined from digital images using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). The PCR conditions used were within the linear range of amplification for input DNA. Primer pairs derived from the TMS1 genomic sequences surrounding the DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS1: 5′-CCA GCT GGA GGG CGC GA-3′ and 5′-GCC GCC GAC CAG GAG GA-3′, HS2: 5′-ACC TGG AGA CCT ACG GCG and 5′-GGC CAA GCG TGG GGA GC-3′, HS3: 5′-ACC CTC ATC CAA CTG CAT G-3′ and 5′-ATC CAG CAG CCA CTC AAC G-3′, HS4: 5′-GGT CAT AGG TTG CAC TTT GC-3′ and 5′-AGC TTG AAC CTG GGA GGT G-3′) were each paired with primers from the promoter region of the human β-actin gene (5′-CCT CAA TCT CGC TCT CGC T-3′ and 5′-CGC GCC TGC GAA CTG GC-3′). Total RNA was isolated from log-phase cells by the Chomczynski and Sacchi method (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63231) Google Scholar). Six micrograms of total RNA was pretreated with amplification grade DNase I (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). One-thirtieth of the reverse transcriptase reaction (200 ng of starting RNA) was used in a PCR reaction. The PCR conditions were: 67 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 16.6 mmNH4SO4, 6.7 μm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4.7 mmMgCl2, 10% Me2SO, and 400 nm of each primer in a 25-μl reaction. A hot start was performed (5 min, 95 °C), followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s. TMS1 primers were 5′-TGG GCC TGC AGG AGA TG-3′ and 5′-ATT TGG TGG GAT TGC CAG-3. β-Actin primers were 5′-CCT TCC TGG GCA TGG AGT CCT G-3′ and 5′-GGA GCA ATG ATC TTG ATC TTC-3′. For multicycle experiments, samples were withdrawn from a 100-μl PCR reaction after 20, 30, and 40 cycles for TMS1or after 15, 25, 35 cycles for β-actin. Samples were run on a 2% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized to random prime-labeled TMS1 or β-actin cDNA probe. Blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and exposed to x-ray film (Biomax-MS, Kodak). We identified TMS1 in a PCR-based subtractive cDNA screen to isolate transcripts that were down-regulated in human fibroblasts stably overexpressing DNMT1 (13Conway K.E. McConnell B.B. Bowring C.E. Donald C.D. Warren S.T. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6236-6242PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that TMS1 is expressed in normal human diploid fibroblasts (IMR90) and their SV40-immortalized counterparts (90SV cells) but is silent in the 90SV derivative cell line expressing 50-fold increased levels of DNMT1 (HMT.1E1 cells) (13Conway K.E. McConnell B.B. Bowring C.E. Donald C.D. Warren S.T. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6236-6242PubMed Google Scholar). These cell lines represent a useful model for studying the genesis and consequences of aberrant CpG island methylation in that they are derived from a common parent (IMR90) yet differ in their expression and methylation status at the TMS1 locus. To examine the role of DNA methylation in TMS1 silencing, we first characterized the TMS1 locus with regards to structure and methylation status in normal diploid fibroblasts (IMR90). The coding sequence of TMS1 covers ∼1.5 kb on chromosome 16p11.2. The promoter region of TMS1 lacks a defined TATA box but contains a 600-bp CpG island predicted on the basis of C+G content (69%) and CpG frequency (CpG observed/expected = 0.82), which extends from ∼200 bp upstream to 400 bp downstream of a single transcription start site (position 1177, Fig.1 A and data not shown). Genomic sequencing of bisulfite-modified DNA was used to construct a map of the methylation status of 110 CpGs across 2.5 kb of theTMS1 locus. Five overlapping regions covering theTMS1 locus were amplified from bisulfite-treated DNA. PCR products were then subcloned, and individual clones were sequenced. This allows for the assessment of the methylation status of independent alleles derived from the cell population. Fig. 1 B shows the percentage of alleles methylated at each CpG site as determined from the analysis of eight to sixteen individual alleles for each primer set. The TMS1 locus was characterized by an unmethylated domain that extended from ∼100 bp upstream to ∼1 kb downstream of the transcription start site and encompassed the entire predicted CpG island plus ∼500 bp of additional downstream sequence (Fig.1 B). CpGs within this region were methylated in no more than one allele per eight to sixteen analyzed with the exception of one CpG site in which three of eight alleles analyzed were methylated. In contrast, sequences upstream of nucleotide 1100 and downstream of 2100 were densely methylated, with distinct 5′ and 3′ boundaries separating the unmethylated CpG island region from heavily methylated flanking DNA (Fig. 1 B). Primary mammary epithelial cells are also completely devoid of methylation in the region from 1100 to 2000 (data not shown). Thus, the pattern shown here appears representative of normal tissues. To determine the relationship between methylation of TMS1and gene silencing, we next analyzed the methylation pattern of 500 bp surrounding the transcription start site (primer set B, see Fig. 1) in the IMR90 fibroblasts, their SV40 immortalized derivatives, the 90SV cells, and the DNMT1 overexpressing derivative HMT.1E1 cells. As discussed above, TMS1 was almost completely unmethylated on individual alleles downstream of nucleotide 1100 in IMR90 cells (Fig. 2 A). Of the few sites that showed methylation, they appeared to be random in that no single CpG site was methylated in more than one allele analyzed (Fig.2 A). Relative to IMR90, 90SV cells showed a partially methylated pattern. There did not appear to be any methylation hot spots in these cells, although there was somewhat more methylation in general in the 5′-end than the 3′-end of the region analyzed. Rather, the analysis of individual subclones was suggestive of two populations of alleles: those that were predominantly methylated and those that were predominantly unmethylated (Fig. 2 A). This pattern is consistent with a mixed cell population in which some cells are methylated for TMS1 and others are not, or with allelic heterogeneity within each cell. The partially methylated pattern of the 90SV cells correlated with a decreased expression of TMS1relative to IMR90 cells (Fig. 2 B). In stark contrast, HMT.1E1 cells showed no detectable TMS1 expression and were methylated at nearly every CpG site on all alleles analyzed (Fig. 2,A and B). Next we used DNase I to probe the nucleoprotein architecture of theTMS1 locus in intact nuclei. Four DNase I-hypersensitive sites, designated HS1–HS4, were identified in the IMR90 fibroblasts (Fig. 3). Interestingly, mapping of the DNase I-hypersensitive sites relative to the DNA methylation map from the same cells (Fig. 1) indicated that HS1, HS2, and HS3 lay within the unmethylated domain, with HS1 and HS3 corresponding almost precisely to the location of the 5′- and 3′-methylation boundaries (compare Fig.3 A with Fig. 1 B). The fourth site (HS4) mapped to about 1 kb downstream of the end of the TMS1 coding region (Fig. 3 A). Similar experiments using a probe anchored at the 5′ HindIII site confirmed the position of the DNase I-hypersensitive sites (data not shown). To determine the relationship between CpG island methylation, gene expression, and chromatin structure, DNase I hypersensitivity assays were also performed on the 90SV and HMT.1E1 cells. All four DNase I-hypersensitive sites found in the IMR90 cells (HS1–HS4) were also observed in the 90SV cells, which express TMS1 and contain a mixed population of unmethylated and methylated alleles (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, complete methylation of the TMS1 CpG island in the HMT.1E1 cells resulted in loss of the CpG island-associated hypersensitive sites HS1, HS2, and HS3 but had no effect on the formation of HS4 (Fig.3 B). HS4 is thus “constitutive” in that its formation is independent of TMS1 expression and methylation status at the CpG island, whereas the CpG island-associated hypersensitive sites (HS1, HS2, and HS3) form only when the CpG island is at least partially unmethylated and TMS1 is expressed. Analysis of the methylation status of the 500 bp surrounding HS4 (primer setE, see Fig. 1) in the 90SV and HMT.1E1 cells indicated a similar pattern to that observed in IMR90 cells (data not shown). These data show that, in normal cells, the chromatin architecture adopted by the unmethylated CpG island is bound by DNase I HS and that methylation-mediated silencing of TMS1 is accompanied by localized changes in the conformation of this domain. Recent evidence suggests that methylation-associated gene repression involves the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other chromatin-modifying factors (22Robertson K.D. Ait-Si-Ali S.

To determine whether methylation-mediated silencing of TMS1 is accompanied by changes in histone acetylation, we analyzed the relative levels of acetylated histone H3 and H4 at the regions corresponding to HS1, HS2, HS3, and HS4 in IMR90, 90SV, and HMT.1E1 cells.

It consists of six Ig and four fibronectin type III (Fn)1 domains and is anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Axonin-1 has been found to engage in different interactions with other cell-surface or extracellular matrix components.

As a first step toward a detailed molecular description of the homophilic and heterophilic interactions of axonin-1, we have determined the crystal structure of the first four N-terminal domains of axonin-1 (7Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We found a U-shaped arrangement of the Ig domains, resulting in the formation of a compact module. In the crystals, these modules are aligned in a string. Adjacent modules exhibit a large edge-to-face contact and are oriented in an antiparallel fashion, with their C termini pointing perpendicularly to the string. This arrangement suggests that cell adhesion by homophilic axonin-1 interactions occurs by the formation of a linear zipper-like array in which the axonin-1 molecules are alternately provided by the two apposed membranes (Fig. 1). In confirmation of this model, mutations in a loop critical for the formation of the zipper result in the loss of the homophilic binding capacity of axonin-1 (7Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that monoclonal antibodies binding either to the first Ig domain or to the third and fourth Fn domains perturb the formation of aggregates between axonin-1-expressing myeloma cells. Our results indicate that two distinct binding sites, one at the N terminus and one at the C terminus of axonin-1, are involved in axonin-1-mediated cell-cell contact. Perturbing the binding in each region alone resulted in a complete loss of axonin-1-mediated cell-cell contact. Therefore, we propose a model for axonin-1-mediated cell-cell binding based on a cooperative action of the N- and C-terminal binding sites. Axonin-1 was purified from the ocular vitreous fluid of embryonic day 14 chicken embryos as described previously (8Ruegg M.A. Stoeckli E.T. Kuhn T.B. Heller M. Zuellig R. Sonderegger P.

One-half was injected into the tail vein, and the other half into the peritoneum. Monoclonal antibodies were produced according to the protocol given by Fazekas de St. Groth and Scheidegger (9Fazekas de St. Groth S. Scheidegger D. J. Immunol. Meth. 1980; 35: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). For fusion with spleen cells, the myeloma cell line X63-Ag8.653 was used. All clones resulting from a fusion were tested 11 days after the fusion, and the test was repeated for slowly growing and negative clones at days 13, 16, and 19. Supernatants were tested for their capacity to recognize native purified axonin-1 in a dot immunobinding assay on nitrocellulose. Binding mAbs were visualized with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). Positive clones were subcloned at least three times. To test anti-axonin-1 mAbs for the capacity to interfere with the formation of cell aggregates, the axonin-1-expressing myeloma cell line 5u (3Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Osterwalder T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was expanded to an approximate density of 105 cells/ml, centrifuged, and resuspended in fresh medium to a final cell number of 106 cells/ml. For testing aggregation, an aliquot of 50 μl was transferred to each well of a microtiter plate (5 × 104 cells/well). Monoclonal IgG or Fab were added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Polyclonal IgG or Fab were used at 1 mg/ml. To test for aggregation, the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 45 min as described previously (3Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Osterwalder T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thereafter, cell aggregation was assessed by counting single cells, small aggregates of 5–10 cells, and large aggregates of >10 cells on an inverted phase-contrast microscope. For each measurement, 100 observations were collected and classified into the three groups (single cells, small aggregates of 5–10 cells, and large aggregates of >10 cells). For each condition, the percentage of observations within each category was determined as the ratio between the experimental condition and the control with no antibody added. To test for statistical significance, we used Student's ttest. Deletion mutants and hybrids of axonin-1 were constructed by loop-out oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and stably transfected into myeloma cells as described previously (10Rader C. Kunz B. Lierheimer R. Giger R.J. Berger P. Tittmann P. Gross H. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The axonin-1 mutants were named according to the domain that was deleted. For example, in ΔIg2, the second Ig domain of axonin-1 was excised. The domain deletion mutants used in this study and the corresponding peptide fragments that were excised are listed below, giving the first and last amino acids of the excised peptide fragment in reference to the amino acid sequence position of wild-type axonin-1 (1Zuellig R.A. Rader C. Schroeder A. Kalousek M.B. von Bohlen und Halbach F. Osterwalder T. Inan C. Stoeckli E.T. Affolter H.-U. Fritz A. Hafen E. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar): 2*1 = Δ(Phe126–Glu227) with the second Ig domain replaced by an additional first Ig domain, ΔIg2 = Δ(Phe126–Glu227), ΔIg3 = Δ(Asp228–His319), ΔIg5 = Δ(Leu410–Arg501), ΔIg6 = Δ(Asp502–Ser594), ΔFn2 = Δ(Thr706–Pro807), ΔFn3 = Δ(Lys808–Pro908), ΔFn4 = Δ(Pro907–Gly1001), ΔIg12 = Δ(Met27–Phe124/Ser131–Ala229), ΔIg1234 = Δ(Met27–Phe124/Ser131–Leu410), and Ig1234 = Δ(Ala409– Ala992)/V994F. The hybrids between axonin-1 and the related cell adhesion molecule F11 (contactin) were previously described by Lierheimer et al. (11Lierheimer R. Kunz B. Vogt L. Savoca R. Brodbeck U. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 502-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The axonin-1/F11 hybrid consisted of Met1–Leu693 of axonin-1 and Pro686–Phe1009 of F11. The F11/axonin-1 hybrid was composed of Met1–Pro686 of F11 and Ser695–Leu1036 of axonin-1. Stably transfected myeloma cells (J558L) were obtained by protoplast fusion (12Oi V.T. Morrison S.L. Herzenberg L.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) with the constructs specified above. To obtain independent transfectants, the cells were diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and cultivated in microtiter plates at 37 °C in 10% CO2. After 2 days, transfected clones were selected by addition of 5 mm l-histidinol (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland). Transfection efficiencies were ∼10−4. After 10 days, the cells were screened for recombinant expression by immunofluorescence staining using rabbit antiserum against axonin-1 or F11 (1:500 dilution) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:100 dilution; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Colonies with high level expression were subcloned. Expression of domain deletion mutants was tested by Western blot analysis. Cell-surface exposition of the expressed domain deletion mutants was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using goat anti-axonin-1 serum and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). To test binding of mAbs, the J558L myeloma cells expressing wild-type or mutant axonin-1 were preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C with hybridoma supernatant or monoclonal anti-IgG antibody at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells that had bound the antibodies were detected by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:200 dilution; Cappel Organon Teknika nv, Turnhout, Belgium). The preparation was examined with a Leitz DMR fluorescence microscope (Leica AG, Glattbrugg, Switzerland) and analyzed with an automated microplate fluorescence reader (Cytofluor 2000, Millipore). Expression of mutant axonin-1 was confirmed using goat polyclonal anti-axonin-1 antibody at a concentration of 500 μg/ml and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody at a dilution of 1:100. Clustering of axonin-1 molecules was recorded by a Zeiss laser scanning microscope (Axioplan LSM 310) using identical conditions for all images. Contrast was set to 418, and brightness to 9999. An adenovirus vector containing an expression cassette for the deletion mutant ΔIg5, termed AdAxΔIg5, was constructed as previously reported for the adenovirus vector coding for the full-length axonin-1 sequence (AdAx) (13Giger R.J. Ziegler U. Hermens W.T.J.M.C. Kunz B. Kunz S. Sonderegger P. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 71: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In both constructs, expression of the transgene is controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter. For viral infection, CV-1 cells were cultured in 60-mm culture dishes until they reached ∼30% confluency. The cells were then trypsinized, counted, and allowed to settle down in culture medium. adenovirus (multiplicity of infection = 20) was added; and 3 h later, the medium was replaced with new culture medium. The experiments were started 48 h after transfection. To quantify the accumulation of axonin-1 and ΔIg5 at the cell contact area of two expressing cells, we determined the distribution coefficient (q) using a laser scanning microscope and NIH Image software. q was equal to the ratio between the fluorescence intensity in the contact area of the two cells (Ica) per area (a) and the average of the fluorescence intensity of the two cell surfaces (Ics1 and Ics2, respectively) per area: q = (Ica/a)/(((Ics1+ Ics2)*½)/a). To localize the surface areas of axonin-1 that are involved in homophilic binding, we tested the capacity of monoclonal antibodies to perturb axonin-1-mediated cell-cell binding and mapped their epitopes on the surface of native axonin-1. To identify such antibodies, we used a cell aggregation assay with myeloma cells stably expressing wild-type axonin-1. The axonin-1-expressing myeloma cells form large cell aggregates mediated by homophilic interactions between axonin-1 molecules (3Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Osterwalder T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We tested 27 mAbs for their capacity to interfere with axonin-1-dependent myeloma cell aggregation. In a pilot experiment, purified mAbs were tested in their IgG form. We found seven mAbs that clearly prevented the formation of aggregates. Together with a random selection of non-perturbing mAbs, these aggregation-perturbing mAbs were subsequently tested as Fab for their capacity to dissociate axonin-1-expressing myeloma cell aggregates (Fig.2). All seven aggregation-perturbing mAbs reduced the percentage of aggregates composed of >10 cells to 10% or less (Fig. 2i). Smaller aggregates composed of at least five cells were still observed, but their number was <45% of the control values. The most potent inhibitors of homophilic binding (U77F8, V10C7, and X9C3) perturbed myeloma cell aggregation completely. In the presence of these mAbs, as with polyclonal anti-axonin-1 Fab antibodies, virtually no cell aggregates were formed. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was used to show that the mAbs that had no effect on the formation of myeloma cell aggregates were capable of binding to cell-surface exposed axonin-1, indicating that their inability to perturb axonin-1-mediated cell aggregation was not due to an inaccessibility of their corresponding epitopes in the membrane-bound form of axonin-1. To localize the epitopes of the mAbs, we used domain deletion mutants of axonin-1 and axonin-1/F11 chimeras stably expressed on the surface of J558L myeloma cells. Entire domains of axonin-1, as defined by their homology to the Ig variable domains or the fibronectin type III domains (1Zuellig R.A. Rader C. Schroeder A. Kalousek M.B. von Bohlen und Halbach F. Osterwalder T. Inan C. Stoeckli E.T. Affolter H.-U. Fritz A. Hafen E. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and by exon/intron borders of the axonin-1 gene (14Giger R.J. Vogt L. Zuellig R.A. Rader C. Henehan-Beatty A. Wolfer D.P. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), were deleted by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Mutant forms of axonin-1 were cloned into the axonin-1 expression vector pMAX (3Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Osterwalder T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Vectors carrying these constructs were introduced into myeloma cells by protoplast fusion (12Oi V.T. Morrison S.L. Herzenberg L.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical staining revealed that all mutants, except ΔIg1, were expressed on the surface of J558L cells. No axonin-1 immunoreactivity was detectable on parental myeloma cells. Myeloma cells stably expressing axonin-1 and axonin-1 deletion mutants on their surface were used for epitope mapping. The presence of an epitope recognized by a particular mAb was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence staining using FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody and fluorescence measurement in the Cytofluor 2000 automated microplate fluorescence reader. Based on the absence of binding to myeloma cells expressing a particular deletion mutant, the epitope of a mAb was allocated to a specific domain of axonin-1 (Fig.3). In our series of 27 mAbs, three were mapped to Ig domain 1 (Ig1), one to Ig3, four to Ig4, one to Ig5, one to Ig6, one to Fn domain 1 (Fn1), one to Fn2, two to Fn3, and five to Fn4. Five mAbs failed to bind to mutants lacking one of the first three Ig domains. Of these five mAbs, four were also unable to bind to mutants lacking the fourth Ig domain (10Rader C. Kunz B. Lierheimer R. Giger R.J. Berger P. Tittmann P. Gross H. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Three mAbs did not bind to mutants lacking either the third or fourth Fn domain. Three of the seven mAbs that interfered with myeloma cell aggregation (U77F8, X7F6, and V3B3) had their cognate epitopes on the first Ig domain. The other four mAbs (X9E9, X9F6, V10C7, and X9C3) were directed to epitopes located on the two C-terminal Fn domains. The epitopes of V10C7 and X9C3 were unequivocally on Fn4, whereas the antibodies of X9E9 and X9F6 required the presence of both Fn3 and Fn4 for binding. The epitopes of the 20 axonin-1-binding antibodies that did not affect axonin-1-mediated myeloma cell aggregation were distributed over the entire axonin-1 molecule. In particular, we found non-perturbing antibodies with epitopes on the same domains as the epitopes of the aggregation-perturbing antibodies, i.e. on the Ig1234 domain conglomerate and on the third and fourth Fn domains. One of the Ig1234-binding ineffective antibodies (X9H8) had previously been found to perturb the heterophilic binding of axonin-1 and NgCAM (10Rader C. Kunz B. Lierheimer R. Giger R.J. Berger P. Tittmann P. Gross H. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that the mAbs that interfere with the homophilic trans-binding of axonin-1 are directed against epitopes that are clustered in two distinctive areas of the axonin-1 molecule, one at the N terminus and the other at the C terminus. Monomeric axonin-1 has been found to exhibit a horseshoe-like domain arrangement in which the N-terminal domain conglomerate of the first four Ig domains comes into close proximity with the C-terminal Fn domains (10Rader C. Kunz B. Lierheimer R. Giger R.J. Berger P. Tittmann P. Gross H. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this conformation, the binding site for NgCAM is only accessible for cis (but not trans)-interaction (15Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Shortening axonin-1 by deleting the fifth or sixth Ig domain enables trans-binding of NgCAM (10Rader C. Kunz B. Lierheimer R. Giger R.J. Berger P. Tittmann P. Gross H. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because back-bending of the N-terminal Ig domains onto the C-terminal Fn domains is less likely in the shortened axonin-1 molecules, the enhanced NgCAM-binding axonin-1 mutant was explained by a statistical shift toward the extended form, in which the NgCAM-binding N-terminal Ig domains are better accessible for a trans-interaction. Likewise, an extended structure has been postulated for axonin-1 engaged in homophilic trans-binding (7Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These observations raised speculations that the cis-binding site in the Fn region was masked in the back-folded form, but became accessible in the extended form of axonin-1. To test whether the propensity of axonin-1 to associate with the cell-cell contact area was enhanced by an extended structure of axonin-1 as compared with the horseshoe-like structure, we analyzed the cell-cell contact regions in confluent cultures of CV-1 cells expressing different forms of axonin-1. We chose axonin-1 in which the fifth Ig domain was deleted (10Rader C. Kunz B. Lierheimer R. Giger R.J. Berger P. Tittmann P. Gross H. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as a form of axonin-1 with a presumptive extended structure. The CV-1 cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus containing an expression cassette of either wild-type axonin-1 (AdAx) or the ΔIg5 mutant (AdAxΔIg5). 2 days after viral infection, the cells were stained for surface axonin-1 by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 4). As demonstrated in Fig. 4a, the cell contact zones between axonin-1-expressing cells showed no or at best weak accumulation of axonin-1 immunoreactivity. In contrast, cells expressing the ΔIg5 mutant of axonin-1 exhibited a pronounced accumulation of axonin-1 immunoreactivity along the contact sites with other cells expressing the axonin-1 mutant (Fig. 4b). Measurements of the fluorescence intensities over free cell-surface membranes and over cell contact lines confirmed a significant accumulation of mutant axonin-1 compared with wild-type axonin-1 at cell contact lines (Fig.4c). These results indicate an enhanced propensity of the extended form of axonin-1 to associate with areas of cell-cell contact. We found that the epitopes of function-blocking monoclonal antibodies against axonin-1 were located in two distant regions, one close to the N terminus (Ig1) and the other close to the C terminus (Fn3 and Fn4). Perturbing the binding of each region alone resulted in a complete loss of axonin-1-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Theoretically, homophilic axonin-1 binding involving two distant binding sites could be formed by (a) an interaction of the N-terminal site of axonin-1A (NA) with the C-terminal site of axonin-1B (CB) (and NB with CA), (b) two distinct trans-interactions between axonin-1A and axonin-1B (NA-NB and CA-CB), or (c) a cooperation of a trans-interaction between the N termini (NA-NB) and a cis-interaction between the C termini of the trans-interacting axonin-1 molecules with the C termini of adjacent axonin-1 molecules (CA-CA′ and CB-CB′). The reverse of the interactions of possibility c is also possible (CA-CB with NA-NA′ and NB-NB′), although, based on steric reasons, less likely. The finding that mAbs against either region alone are capable of abolishing axonin-1-mediated cell-cell contacts is obvious for possibilities a and c. For possibilityb, the explanation would be that only N-N or C-C trans-interactions would not be sufficient to support cell-cell binding. Alternatively, for possibility d, one could speculate that the binding of mAbs to the membrane-proximal epitopes of axonin-1 might perturb a role of the Fn region in controlling the conformation or dynamic accessibility of the Ig1–4 region. This possibility is plausibly supported by the observation that monomeric axonin-1 has a horseshoe form that is thought to be stabilized by an intramolecular contact between the N-terminal Ig region and the C-terminal Fn region (10Rader C. Kunz B. Lierheimer R. Giger R.J. Berger P. Tittmann P. Gross H. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). From these possibilities, we favor a cooperation of two interactions, one among N-terminal binding sites and another among C-terminal binding sites of adjacent axonin-1 molecules anchored to the same membrane because previous studies have clearly demonstrated that both isolated N- and C-terminal fragments exhibit the capacity of self-binding (7Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar,16Tsiotra P.C. Theodorakis K. Papamatheakis J. Karagogeos D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29216-29222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the crystals of the module formed by the first four Ig domains of axonin-1, Freigang et al. (7Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have identified an extended edge-to-face contact between adjacent molecules, consistent with the formation of a linear string of molecules. Adjacent molecules in the string are in antiparallel orientation, and their C termini point perpendicularly to the axis of the string. This arrangement prompted a model for axonin-1-mediated cell-cell adhesion in which the N-terminal Ig1–4 modules of axonin-1 molecules of apposed membranes become engaged in a homophilic trans-contact by interlacing in a zipper-like manner. In support of the model, the mutation of two amino acids located within the edge-to-face contact region (H186A and F189A) resulted in a complete loss of axonin-1-mediated cell aggregation. Likewise, Tsiotra et al. (16Tsiotra P.C. Theodorakis K. Papamatheakis J. Karagogeos D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29216-29222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have reported an aggregation of Schneider line 2 cells transfected with the Fn moiety of TAX-1, the human ortholog of axonin-1. These results unequivocally reflect the existence of a homophilic binding site within the Fn moiety. However, although the evidence for this binding site has been obtained in an assay reporting for trans-interactions, it is possible that the biologically relevant in vivo interaction reflected in this assay occurs in cis. As previously observed with axonin-1 and NgCAM, topological information may be lost in binding assays due to orientation, conformational, or sterical deviations from the normal situation (for a well documented example, compare Refs. 4Kuhn T.B. Stoeckli E.T. Condrau M.A. Rathjen F.G. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1113-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar and15Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the case of truncated TAX-1 molecules overexpressed on the surface of Schneider cells, a cis-binding site between Fn segments arranged in parallel (as expected for a cis-interaction) could readily cause cell-cell aggregation via trans-binding if enough orientation freedom is provided to allow a tilt of the binding segment from the perpendicular to the membrane plane. Because of their proximity to the membrane, these binding sites in the Fn region are more likely to interact in cis than in trans. Distance measurements between a silicon substratum coated with covalently coupled full-length axonin-1 and growth cones of cultivated sensory ganglial neurons (17Sorribas H. Braun D. Leder L. Sonderegger P. Tiefenauer L. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2001; 104: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) indeed revealed values that exclude a trans-interaction between the Fn regions (see below for quantitative aspects). Therefore, we propose that the binding site in the Fn region mediates cis-contacts between the membrane-proximal Fn regions of axonin-1 molecules of the same membrane. Based on the results presented here and published observations, we propose a cis-assisted trans-binding mechanism for the axonin-1-mediated cell-cell aggregation. As depicted in Fig.5, the N-terminal binding site (located on a domain module comprising Ig1–4) binds in trans, forming a linear zipper-like array with molecules alternately provided by the two apposed membranes (7Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The binding is strengthened by the cis-contacts of the C-terminal binding sites (located on Fn3 and Fn4), which mediate a side-by-side arrangement of the linear strings into a two-dimensional array. This model reconciles the currently available observations on direct interactions between recombinant fragments of axonin-1 (7Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Tsiotra P.C. Theodorakis K. Papamatheakis J. Karagogeos D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29216-29222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the results of our antibody perturbation studies on cell-cell adhesion mediated by full-length axonin-1. The model is also in agreement with recent distance measurements. Using fluorescence interference contrast microscopy, a minimal distance of 37 nm between growth cones of cultivated sensory ganglial neurons and a silicon substratum coated with covalently coupled axonin-1 has been measured (17Sorribas H. Braun D. Leder L. Sonderegger P. Tiefenauer L. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2001; 104: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on the distance of the C termini of adjacent axonin-1 Ig1–4 modules in the crystals (10 nm) (7Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the length of a tandem array of two Ig domains (9 nm) (7Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the length of a tandem array of two Fn domains (6 nm) (18Huber A.H. Wang Y.M. Bieber A.J. Bjorkman P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 717-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the length of the proline- and glycine-rich decapeptide between the Ig and Fn moieties (3 nm), the membranes connected by trans-bound axonin-1 in a completely extended conformation would be at a maximum distance of 58 nm. Assuming that cis-interactions between Fn domains would result in a tilt of at least part of the domains from the perpendicular to the membrane plane or that tandems of Ig and Fn domains are partially juxtaposed, such as in CD4 (19Wu H. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), a considerably shorter intermembrane distance than that calculated for an extended structure of axonin-1 would result. Based on the measured minimal distance of 37 nm, a homophilic trans-contact between Fn domains (and thus, a binding model with two trans-contacts) is excluded. With a homophilic trans-contact between the two membrane-proximal Fn domains, membranes would be required to approach each other to 12 nm or less; with a homophilic trans-contact between the first Fn domains, an intermembrane distance of 24 nm or less would be required. In the structure found by negative staining electron microscopy of purified soluble axonin-1, the axonin-1 molecule is bent in a horseshoe-like form so that its two ends become located in close proximity (10Rader C. Kunz B. Lierheimer R. Giger R.J. Berger P. Tittmann P. Gross H. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored form of axonin-1, the four N-terminal Ig domains bearing the NgCAM-binding site (20Kunz S. Spirig M. Ginsburg C. Buchstaller A. Berger P. Lanz R. Rader C. Vogt L. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1673-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) are turned back to the cell membrane. Based on this structure, the absence of heterophilic trans-binding between axonin-1 and NgCAM exposed on the surface of different myeloma cells (15Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) is explained. Interestingly, the ΔIg5 mutant of axonin-1, in which the fifth Ig domain was deleted, exhibits a strikingly enhanced trans-binding of NgCAM (10Rader C. Kunz B. Lierheimer R. Giger R.J. Berger P. Tittmann P. Gross H. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is plausible for sterical reasons that the deletion of an Ig domain in the interior of the molecule restrains the back-folding and thus favors the extended structure in which the N-terminal Ig1–4 module is better accessible for a trans-binding ligand. In this study, we have found that the ΔIg5 mutant of axonin-1 also exhibits an enhanced tendency to associate with the cell contact area, as demonstrated by the observation of an increased accumulation of the ΔIg5 mutant at cell contact sites in CV-1 cells (Fig. 4). As is the case of trans-binding to NgCAM, the presumed extended structure of the ΔIg5 mutant may facilitate the establishment of homophilic trans-binding by anticipating the conformational transition from the horseshoe to the extended form. The hypothesis that a major conformational change is required for the establishment of homophilic axonin-1/axonin-1 binding is further supported by the observed discrepancy between cell-cell and Covaspheres-Covaspheres binding studies. Axonin-1 expressed on the surface of myeloma cells in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored form mediates cell aggregation by homophilic binding (for details, see Ref. 3Rader C. Stoeckli E.T. Ziegler U. Osterwalder T. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas no homophilic binding is observed when axonin-1 is covalently coupled to the surface of Covaspheres via a reaction with amino group-reactive sites on the Covaspheres. Such a discrepancy between the function of the cell surface-anchored form and the Covaspheres-conjugated form has not been observed for NgCAM (4Kuhn T.B. Stoeckli E.T. Condrau M.A. Rathjen F.G.

As a possible explanation, one may speculate that binding to the Covaspheres, possibly via multiple amino groups on the surface of each axonin-1 molecule, restricts the conformational freedom of axonin-1 that much that it may no longer be capable of assuming the extended conformation that is required for an engagement in homophilic binding. In conclusion, these results indicate that the transition from a horseshoe to an extended form of axonin-1 is required for the establishment of homophilic trans-binding between axonin-1 molecules of different cells. The Fn region, by binding to Ig1–4, stabilizes the horseshoe conformation and thus reduces the accessibility of the Ig1–4 module for trans-binding. Therefore, the most plausible conformational consequence of a mAb binding to Fn would be an enhanced trans-interaction. Thus, both restraining the back-bending into the horseshoe structure and interfering with the conformational function of the Fn region by antibodies should enhance trans-binding. The loss of cell-cell binding in the presence of mAbs against Fn can thus not be explained by a conformational effect. Therefore, we speculate that the transition from the horseshoe to the extended form not only increases the accessibility of the Ig1–4 modules for homophilic trans-binding, but in addition interferes with another function. In view of the published homophilic binding site in Fn (16Tsiotra P.C. Theodorakis K. Papamatheakis J. Karagogeos D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29216-29222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), an interference with the side-by-side association of adjacent axonin-1 molecules seems to us the most plausible explanation for the binding-perturbing activity of the mAbs against Fn. A cooperation of two distinctive binding sites, the one acting in cis and the other in trans, has also been found for cell-cell interactions mediated by cadherins (for a recent review, see Ref. 22Koch A.W. Bozic D. Pertz O. Engel J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In cadherins, the cis-binding site is located within the N-terminal domain pairs, and dimerization by cis-binding has been found to have an indispensable preparatory role for the subsequent establishment of trans-binding. In the cis-assisted trans-binding model for axonin-1-mediated cell-cell adhesion, as proposed here, we postulate that cis-binding is not required for the establishment of trans-binding because, in the crystals of axonin-1 Ig1–4, the linear strings of Ig1–4 modules formed also in the absence of the Fn moiety. Thus, the cis-binding among Fn regions of axonin-1 rather plays a role after the trans-binding by the Ig1–4 modules has been installed. It serves the expansion and enhancement of the cell-cell contact area initiated by the formation of linear strings of trans-bound axonin-1. After the first cis-contact of Fn domains of axonin-1 of two linear strings has become established, adjacent axonin-1 molecules of the one string would preferably become engaged in cis-contacts with adjacent axonin-1 molecules of the other string, resulting in the lateral alignment of the strings. Weak affinity between Fn domains provided, imperfect alignments could be improved, as single contacts could be broken and new ones established repeatedly during an ongoing optimization period until a parallel arrangement of multiple strings is reached. A further optimization of the package of trans-bound axonin-1 molecules would be realized by the exclusion of monomeric axonin-1 molecules from the contact area.

Constitutive active forms of c-Raf-1, MEKK1 and MKK6, proximal regulators of the ERKs, JNKs, and p38 MAPKs, respectively, all stimulated NFLC-Luc activity. NFLC-Luc activity stimulated by NGF, however, was partially (∼50%) inhibited by the MEK inhibitor, PD098059, or by co-transfection of kinase-inactive MEK1 but not by the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, indicating a role for the ERKs, but not the p38 MAPKs, in NGF regulation of the NFLC promoter. Importantly, a gain-of-function MKK7-JNK3 fusion protein stimulated NFLC-Luc and synergized with gain-of-function c-Raf-1 to activate the NFLC promoter. In addition, transfection of kinase-inactive forms of MEK1 and MKK7 produced an additive inhibition of NGF-stimulated NFLC-Luc relative to either inhibitor alone. These findings indicate that the ERK and JNK pathways collaborate downstream of the NGF receptor for regulation of the NFLC promoter.

Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar) provides a useful cell culture system in which to explore the mechanism by which MAP kinases control cell differentiation. Incubation of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) leads to growth arrest and cellular hypertrophy as well as the acquisition of a neural morphology typified by extension of neurites. A molecular correlate of the morphologic differentiation of PC12 cells is induction of neurofilaments (3Lindenbaum M.H. Carbonetto S. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 605-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that are composed of heavy, medium, and light polypeptide chains (4Julien J.-P. Curr. Opin.

Neurochem. 1991; 57: 802-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) of neurofilament proteins is thought to contribute to the extension and stabilization of neuronal processes. Moreover, the rat NFLC promoter has been characterized and shown to be induced by NGF in PC12 cells (6Reeben M. Neuman T. Palgi J. Palm K. Paalme V. Saarma M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), indicating that transcriptional induction contributes to the increased content of neurofilament proteins. Mutational analysis of the NGF receptor has defined the requirement for collaborative signaling through phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and the monomeric G protein, Ras, for morphologic differentiation of PC12 cells (7Stephens R.M.

Similar mutational studies with ectopically expressed βPDGF receptors demonstrated the requirement for Ras signaling in combination with signaling through the Src family tyrosine kinases or regulation of PLCγ (9Fanger G.R.

A clearly defined action of Ras within cells is the stimulation of MAP kinase cascades including the ERK pathway (11Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The ability of constitutive active forms of proximal regulators of the ERK pathway to induce morphological differentiation suggests that the ERK pathway is necessary and perhaps sufficient for morphologic differentiation of PC12 cells (12Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). However, mutant βPDGF receptors that can activate the ERK pathway, but not Src or PLCγ, failed to induce morphologic PC12 cell differentiation (10Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), indicating that the ERK pathway is not sufficient for growth factor-induced PC12 cell differentiation and requires collaboration with other signals. Expression of GTPase-deficient, constitutive active forms of Gαq proteins or incubation with bone morphogenetic protein-2 induced PC12 cell differentiation accompanied by persistent activation of the JNK family of MAP kinases (13Heasley L.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17360-17365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Significantly, the ERKs were not activated in these settings, indicating that PC12 cell differentiation can sometimes occur independently of the ERK pathway and that the JNK pathway may contribute as well to transcriptional induction of PC12 cell differentiation. In this study, we have employed a luciferase reporter construct controlled by the neurofilament light chain (NFLC) promoter to define MAP kinase pathways required for regulation by NGF. Our findings indicate that the ERK pathway functions in a collaborative fashion with the JNK pathway to regulate the NFLC promoter. In addition, our studies show that these MAP kinases integrate at a cAMP-response element/activating transcription factor enhancer site that binds the transcription factors c-Jun, JunD, and CREB to regulate the NFLC promoter in response to NGF. PD098059 and SB203580 were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). NGF, EGF, and IGF-1 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The neurofilament light chain antibody was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies to CREB and phospho-S73 c-Jun were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and the antibody to c-Jun and JunD was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Based on the reported sequence of the rat NFLC promoter (6Reeben M. Neuman T. Palgi J. Palm K. Paalme V. Saarma M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the forward primer 5′-GTAGCGGTACCCGTCCCCTATGTATTGAGA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCTCAGGCCCGGGGCGGAGATAGGGGACCT-3′ were synthesized and used to amplify by PCR the NFLC promoter sequences −655 to +82 from rat PC12 cell genomic DNA. The PCR product was cloned into the pT7 Blue (Novagen) vector and submitted to DNA dideoxy sequencing, revealing a sequence identical to that deposited under the GenBankTM accession number X53981 and previously reported by Reeben et al. (6Reeben M. Neuman T. Palgi J. Palm K. Paalme V. Saarma M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The NFLC promoter was excised from pT7 Blue with KpnI (cuts at −646 bp of the promoter) and HindIII (cuts in the polylinker of pT7 Blue) and ligated into pA3Luc, a promoterless luciferase vector, that had been double-digested with KpnI and HindIII, thereby generating NFLC-Luc. The CRE/ATF site at −46 to −36 bp (6Reeben M. Neuman T. Palgi J. Palm K. Paalme V. Saarma M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was converted from CTGCGTCAGAG to CCAAATCAGAG (CRE-Mut) within the −650 to +82 NFLC promoter by PCR-based mutagenesis. To generate progressively 5′-truncated NFLC promoter fragments, the −650/+82 NFLC-Luc construct was employed as a template for PCR using forward primers that annealed at −401 (5′-GGTACCGCAGAAAGGGCGAGCCAGGGG-3′), −201 (5′-GGTACCGAAAGTAGGGGGCCTCAG-3′), −128 (5′-GGTACCTTTGCTCTTGCGCAGAATCC-3′), −98 (5′-GGTACCGCTGCAGCAGCACGCTGC-3′), −38 (5′-GGTACCGAGTCCCGGCGTATAAAT-3′), and −19 bp (5′-GGTACCGAGGTGGCAGGACAGCCC-3′) of the NFLC promoter and a reverse primer that annealed within the luciferase coding sequences of pA3Luc (5′-TCC-AGAGGAATTCATTATCAGTGC-3′). The amplified products were sequenced and ligated into pA3Luc that had been double-digested with KpnI and EcoRI. Zheng et al. (15Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have reported that a fusion protein consisting of MKK7 and JNK1 exhibited a gain-of-function phenotype. We created a cDNA encoding a similar polypeptide by fusing the murine MKK7β1 cDNA (16Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the rat p46 JNK3 cDNA (17Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar), creating a MKK7β1-JNK3 fusion protein. To introduce an in-frame (Glu-Gly)5 linker between MKK7β1 and p46 JNK3 proteins, the MKK7β1 cDNA was submitted to PCR with a forward primer, 5′-GAGATACTCGAGGTGGATGTCGC-3′, which contains the single MKK7β1 XhoI site (underlined), and the reverse primer 5′-CCACCGGTCCCTCGCCCTCGCCCTCGCCCTCGCCCTCCCTGAAGAAGGGCAGATG-3′, which encodes the (Glu-Gly)5 linker as a replacement for the MKK7β1 stop codon and an AgeI site (underlined) to facilitate ligation to an N-terminal JNK3 PCR product. A PCR product containing an AgeI site and the sequences encoding the N-terminal portion of p46 JNK3 (up to the BstXI site) was generated using the forward primer, 5′-CCACCGGTGAGCAAAAGCAAGGTAGATAA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GATCCCAGCGGAGTGGAGGTGTTTGAT-3′. The MKK7-(Glu-Gly)5 and the p46JNK3 fragments were cloned into the pGEMT Easy vector (Promega) for DNA sequencing. The N-terminal fragment of p46JNK3 was excised from the pGEMT vector withAgeI and BstXI and ligated into PGEMT-MKK7β1-(Glu-Gly)5 previously digested withAgeI and BstXI. The resulting MKK7β1-(Glu-Gly)5/N-terminal JNK3 fragment was excised with XhoI-BstXI and ligated along with theBstXI-ClaI fragment of p46JNK3 (JNK3 C terminus) from LNCX-HA-p46JNK3 (18Butterfield L. Zentrich E. Beekman A. Heasley L.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) into XhoI-ClaI-digested LNCX-FLAG-MKK7β1, thereby generating FLAG-MKK7β1-(Glu-Gly)5-p46JNK3 in the pLNCX retroviral expression vector (19Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). The XhoI, AgeI, andBstXI ligation junctions were confirmed by DNA dideoxynucleotide sequencing. AnHindIII-NotI fragment of human c-JUN cDNA was excised from pRSV-c-Jun and ligated into pLNCX digested withHindIII and HpaI. Sequences encoding the DNA-binding domain of c-Jun (residues 224–331) were amplified from the human c-JUN cDNA and epitope-tagged (hemagglutinin) by PCR, sequenced, and ligated into the HindIII and ClaI sites of pLNCX. Aliquots of PC12 cells (2 million cells in 100 μl) were electroporated (220 V and 250 microfarads with a GeneZAPPER (IBI, New Haven, CT)) in Gene Pulser 0.4-cm electrode gap cuvettes (Bio-Rad). PC12 cells were transfected with 2 μg of NFLC-Luc, 1 μg of pCMV-βGal for determination of transfection efficiency, 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA as a carrier, and other expression plasmids as indicated in the figure legends. Following electroporation, the PC12 cells were plated on collagen-coated dishes in full media for 24 h at 37 °C. The growth medium was subsequently replaced with DMEM containing 1% horse serum and antibiotics with growth factors or protein kinase inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends, and the transfected cells were returned to the incubator for 3 days. The transfected PC12 cells were then collected, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 250 μl of Luciferase Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). The cell lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge, and aliquots (80 μl) of the supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity with a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI) and luciferase assay substrate from Promega. Aliquots (15 μl) of the extracts were also assayed for β-galactosidase (β-Gal) to correct for transfection efficiency. The data are presented as relative light units (RLU) per milliunit of β-galactosidase (RLU/milliunit β-Gal). For preparation of nuclear extracts, PC12 cells were cultured for 4 days in DMEM containing 1% horse serum with or without 100 ng/ml NGF. The cells were then harvested and nuclear extracts prepared as follows. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 volumes of 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mm PMSF at 4 °C for 10 min, homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellets containing the nuclei were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.2 mmPMSF, homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 25,000 ×g and the supernatants recovered. Extracts were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mmDTT, 20% glycerol and stored at −70 °C. Overlapping sense and antisense oligonucleotides encompassing the CRE/ATF site located at −56 to −28 within the NFLC promoter sequence (6Reeben M. Neuman T. Palgi J. Palm K. Paalme V. Saarma M. J.

Aliquots (80,000 cpm) of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotides were incubated (30 min, 4 °C) in a total volume of 20 μl with 5 μg of nuclear extracts, 0.125 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, and 20% glycerol. For competition studies, the indicated concentrations of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were added to the reaction prior to addition of the radiolabeled probe. In the supershift experiments, antibodies were preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min prior to the addition of 32P-labeled DNA. Protein-DNA complexes were electrophoresed on 5% acrylamide gels at 25 mA/gel for 2 h in 25 mm Tris, 1.0 mm EDTA, 190 mm glycine. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 12–24 h. RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from PC12 cells that had been cultured for 1–4 days in DMEM containing 1% horse serum with or without 100 ng/ml NGF. Reverse transcription of total RNA (5 μg) was performed in a volume of 20 μl using random hexamers and murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Aliquots (10 μl) of the reverse transcription reactions were then submitted to PCR with oligonucleotides specific for the rat NFLC mRNA (forward primer, 5′-TCACCAGCGTGGGTAGCATAAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGGGGCTCAATCTTTCTTCTTAGC-3′) yielding a 436-bp product or specific for rat GAPDH mRNA (forward primer, 5′-ATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAACGGATACATTGGGGGTAGG-3′) yielding a 508-bp product. The PCR conditions for amplification of NFLC were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, and the GAPDH PCR conditions were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Aliquots (20 μl) of the PCRs were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. To confirm that the NFLC PCR amplified authentic NFLC cDNA, a Southern blot was performed. The agarose gel containing the NFLC PCR products was denatured for 30 min in 0.2 n NaOH, 0.5 m NaCl and neutralized by two washes in 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 2.5 mm EDTA followed by one wash in 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm EDTA. The gel was electrophoretically transferred to a Zeta-Probe (Bio-Rad) membrane, UV cross-linked, and pre-hybridized at 42 °C in 10 ml of Rapid-hob buffer (Amersham Biosciences). A single-strand oligonucleotide probe (5′-TCAGAGGTGGAGGAGACCATTG-3′) corresponding to NFLC base pairs 1428–1449 was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with the membrane at a concentration of 1 × 106 cpm/ml for 1 h at 42 °C. The membrane was subsequently washed at room temperature in 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS and twice in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C and exposed to x-ray film for 2 h. Samples of cell extracts prepared in MAP kinase lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml aprotinin) supplemented with 300 mm NaCl were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) and 3% nonfat dry milk (or 3% bovine serum albumin for phospho-c-Jun antibodies) and then incubated with blocking solution containing the indicated antibodies at 1 μg/ml for 12–16 h. The filters were extensively washed in TTBS, and bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). PC12 cells were lysed in MAP kinase lysis buffer and clarified by a 5-min microcentrifugation (10,000 × g). For assay of JNK activity, aliquots of the extracts containing 200 μg of protein in a volume of 0.5 ml were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of anti-JNK1 (JNK1 (C-17) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and 10 μl (packed bead volume) of protein A-Sepharose. The complexes were washed three times by repetitive centrifugation in lysis buffer and then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼5,000 cpm/pmol) containing 2 μg of His6-ATF2-NT as described previously (20Butterfield L. Storey B. Maas L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10110-10116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated with 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and submitted to 10% SDS-PAGE. The ATF2-NT polypeptides were identified in Coomassie-stained gels, excised, and counted in a scintillation counter. ERK activity was similarly assayed with an immune complex assay using 2 μg each of anti-ERK1 (C-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-ERK2 (C-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the peptide substrate EGFR-(661–682) as described previously (13Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Zamarripa J. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NFLC protein is a defined marker of neural cells that is involved in neurite outgrowth and function (4Julien J.-P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored whether the NFLC gene is a target of NGF-stimulated MAP kinase pathways in PC12 cells. As determined by RT-PCR, the NFLC mRNA was induced in a delayed fashion with a maximal observed increase of ∼10-fold after 3–4 days of NGF treatment (Fig.1, A and B). This finding is consistent with a previous report (21Lindenbaum M.H. Carbonetto S. Grosveld F. Flavell D. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5662-5667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of increased NFLC transcription and mRNA accumulation in NGF-treated PC12 cells. The content of the GAPDH mRNA did not change over the same time course (Fig. 1C). Similar to the delayed induction of NFLC mRNA, the NFLC protein as detected by immunoblot analysis was increased by 2 days and maximally increased after 3–4 days of NGF treatment. This time course of NFLC mRNA and protein accumulation coincides with the onset of neurite outgrowth in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells. We constructed a luciferase reporter containing NFLC promoter sequences −655 to +82 (see “Experimental Procedures”) to identify signal pathways that mediate NGF-stimulated NFLC induction as a marker for PC12 cell differentiation. Transient transfection of the NFLC-Luc plasmid into PC12 cells revealed a pronounced ∼8-fold induction of luciferase activity (Fig. 2) following 3 days of incubation with NGF, similar to the degree of NFLC mRNA induction observed in Fig. 1. A weaker ∼3.5-fold induction of NFLC-Luc activity was measured in response to EGF, consistent with the relative ability of these two growth factors to induce morphologic differentiation in our PC12 cell cultures. IGF-1, a potent trophic factor but inactive differentiative agent for PC12 cells (22Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), failed to stimulate NFLC-luciferase over the basal activity and also failed to increase NFLC protein content (Fig. 2, inset). Morphologic differentiation of PC12 cells by NGF requires signal transduction through Ras, and expression of constitutive active Ras elicits many of the morphologic and molecular actions of NGF in PC12 cells. Expression of constitutive active Ha-Ras (RasG12V) stimulated the NFLC promoter activity 4.5-fold from 144 ± 30 to 654 ± 64 RLU/milliunit β-Gal, similar to the 6-fold NGF response (850 ± 157 RLU/milliunit β-Gal) in these experiments. By contrast, transfection of the dominant-negative Ras molecule, RasN17, yielded basal and NGF-stimulated luciferase activities of 252 ± 81 and 422 ± 118 RLU/milliunit β-Gal, respectively, a significantly reduced 1.7-fold stimulation. Thus, the growth factor selectivity (NGF > EGF > IGF-1) and Ras requirement of NGF-stimulated NFLC-luciferase activity are consistent with the previously established growth factor sensitivity and Ras requirement of PC12 cell differentiation. Ras is a proximal regulator of multiple signal pathways including the ERK and JNK MAPK pathways (11Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Transfection of constitutive active c-Raf (BXB-Raf), an upstream activator of the ERK pathway, significantly increased NFLC-Luc activity in the absence of NGF (Fig.3, A and B). The BXB-Raf-stimulated NFLC-Luc activity was completely inhibited by the MEK inhibitor, PD098059 (Fig. 3A), or co-transfected kinase-inactive MEK1 (MEK1-K97M) (Fig. 3B). However, a concentration of PD098059 or MEK1-K97M sufficient to inhibit completely the BXB-Raf response only partially (∼40–50%) inhibited NGF-induced NFLC-Luc activity (Fig. 3, A and B). This is consistent with the reduction, but not elimination, of the NGF-stimulated neurite outgrowth response in our PC12 cell cultures by PD098059 (not shown). The partial reduction of NFLC-Luc induction by PD098059 was not due to a partial MEK inhibition in these experiments because the concentration of drug employed completely inhibited persistently increased ERK activation measured after 24 h of NGF treatment from 3.6-fold in control cells to 0.8-fold in cells treated with PD098059. Thus, two different ERK pathway inhibitors at levels sufficient to inhibit the Raf-1 response yielded only a partial inhibition of the NGF stimulation, indicating that additional signal pathways collaborate with the ERK pathway for full regulation of the NFLC promoter by NGF. The p38 MAPK pathway has been reported to be regulated by NGF in PC12 cells and also proposed as a signal pathway that mediates some of the actions of NGF in PC12 cells (23Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Expression of a constitutive active MKK6 cDNA in which the activation-associated phosphorylation sites are mutated to glutamic acid (MKK6-EE) significantly increased NFLC-Luc activity from 125 ± 26 to 671 ± 109 RLU/milliunit β-Gal (p < 0.05), indicating that the p38 MAPK pathway can activate this NGF-responsive promoter. However, incubation of PC12 cells with the 5 μm SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the MKK6-EE-stimulated luciferase activity (206 ± 34 RLU/milliunit β-Gal) but had no significant effect on the induction of the promoter by NGF (1887 ± 497 and 1787 ± 607 RLU/milliunit β-Gal for control and SB203580-treated, respectively). Thus, the p38 MAPK pathway does not significantly contribute to regulation of the NFLC promoter by NGF. Transfection of an activated form of MEKK1 also significantly stimulated NFLC-Luc activity but was only modestly reduced by PD098059 (Fig. 3A), indicating that MEKK1 activated the NFLC promoter largely through MEK/ERK-independent pathways. MEKK1 is a known upstream activator of the JNK pathway (24Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar), suggesting that MKK4 or MKK7, proximal activators of the JNK pathway, may mediate the increased NFLC-Luc activity. Although gain-of-function forms of MKK4 or MKK7 analogous to constitutive active MEK1 and MKK6 do not exist, a fusion protein of MKK7 and JNK1 exhibits a gain-of-function phenotype when transfected into cells and activates neither ERKs nor p38 MAPKs (15Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We generated a similar construct with an N-terminal MKK7 cDNA fused in frame with a C-terminal JNK3 cDNA and observed constitutive activity as assessed in vivo with c-Jun-GAL4 transcriptional activation assays and in vitro with c-Jun protein kinase activity (data not shown). As shown in Fig.4A, transfection of the MKK7-JNK3 construct alone activated the NFLC-Luc reporter ∼3-fold. Moreover, co-transfection of MKK7-JNK3 and BXB-Raf yielded a more than additive response compared with either MKK7-JNK3 or BXB-Raf alone. Th"

A notable example of heteromer formation is the interaction of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) with different members of the receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP) family, which results in the formation of two different receptors, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor and an adrenomedullin receptor.

As key controllers of diverse physiological processes, they are of considerable biological and therapeutic interest. Although this class of receptors was originally thought to act as monomers that mediate their effects through stimulation of heterotrimeric G proteins, recent studies indicate that they can also act as multimeric complexes that, besides G proteins, can directly regulate a variety of other downstream effectors, including mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and transcription factors (1Milligan G. White J.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 513-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Several early lines of evidence have suggested that certain families of GPCRs can form homo-oligomers (2Hebert T.E. Bouvier M. Biochem.

Moreover, some receptors appear to require interaction with additional accessory factors for proper function (9Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 10Roche K.W., Tu, J.C. Petralia R.S. Xiao B. Wenthold R.J. Worley P.F. J. Biol.

Science. 2000; 287: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). GPCRs therefore seem to function in a rather complex molecular environment. One striking example of the complexity of some GPCRs is provided by receptors for adrenomedullin (ADM) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), two members of the calcitonin family of peptides. In this case, a seven-transmembrane protein, the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), has been reported to require two different types of associated proteins, receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs) and receptor component protein (RCP), for full activity (13Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 184-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Evans B.N. Rosenblatt M.I. Mnayer L.O. Oliver K.R. Dickerson I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31438-31443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptors calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor activity modifying protein calcitonin receptor-like receptor adrenomedullin receptor component protein 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin CGRP is a potent vasoactive neuropeptide, which has been implicated in vasodilation, migraine, and chronic pain, whereas ADM is a multifunctional regulatory peptide with a wide range of biological actions, including vasodilation, cell growth, natriuresis, and certain antimicrobial effects (15Hinson J.P. Kapas S. Smith D.M. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 138-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 16Wimalawansa S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 533-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Despite the physiological importance and clinical implications of these two peptides, the identification and characterization of their receptors have been difficult for some time. A seven-transmembrane protein with 55% homology to the calcitonin receptor (CRLR) provided CGRP receptor function only after transfection into specific cellular backgrounds (17Fluhmann B. Muff R. Hunziker W. Fischer J.A. Born W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Aiyar N. Rand K. Elshourbagy N.A. Zeng Z. Adamou J.E. Bergsma D.J. Li Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11325-11329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The lack of a CGRP response in other cell lines made positive identification of this protein as a CGRP receptor problematic and suggested that CRLR might require cell type-specific accessory factors to become CGRP-responsive. A novel accessory protein, RAMP1, was identified that generated a functional CGRP receptor upon co-transfection with CRLR into cell culture (19McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Confirming the idea that cell type-specific co-factors are required for CGRP responsiveness, transfection of CRLR into cell lines only yielded a functional CGRP receptor when the cell line endogenously expresses RAMP1. Conversely, transfection with RAMP1 only resulted in CGRP receptor function in cells containing CRLR (18Aiyar N. Rand K. Elshourbagy N.A. Zeng Z. Adamou J.E. Bergsma D.J. Li Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11325-11329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 19McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). RAMP1 belongs to a family of single transmembrane proteins, which currently consists of three members as follows: RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3. Surprisingly, co-expression of CRLR with either RAMP2 or RAMP3 resulted in formation of a receptor with different ligand specificity, an adrenomedullin receptor (19McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which RAMPs affect CRLR signaling is not completely understood; to date three functions have been associated with these accessory proteins. RAMPs can 1) act as a chaperone, facilitating the transport of CRLR from the Golgi to the plasma membrane; 2) they may determine receptor specificity by being part of the ligand binding site and/or by modifying CRLR conformation; and 3) they may define the glycosylation status of the receptor and thus determine ligand specificity (13Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 184-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 19McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). In addition to RAMPs, another accessory protein was found to confer CGRP receptor function inXenopus laevis oocytes (20Luebke A.E. Dahl G.P. Roos B.A. Dickerson I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3455-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to RAMPs, this receptor component protein (RCP) did not restore CGRP receptor function after co-transfection with CRLR in mammalian cells. Because RCP is ubiquitously expressed and was present in all of the cellular background where CRLR/RAMPs were co-transfected, it was possible that the RCP protein, although by itself not sufficient to confer CGRP responsiveness, was nevertheless part of the receptor complex. Indeed, recent co-immunoprecipitation and antisense studies indicate that RCP is part of the CRLR-RAMP receptor complexes and that it has a role in modulating signal transduction properties of these receptors (14Evans B.N. Rosenblatt M.I. Mnayer L.O. Oliver K.R. Dickerson I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31438-31443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In retrospect, the fact that different cell lines endogenously express various components that affect CGRP and ADM signaling has complicated the identification of the molecular nature of CGRP and ADM receptors. A heterologous expression system that lacks endogenous expression of both RCPs and RAMPs might be useful to study the contribution of the various accessory proteins to the pharmacology of the CGRP and ADM receptors. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used for the heterologous expression of many G protein-coupled receptors. Cells in which receptors are functionally coupled to the mating factor response pathway (21Pausch M.H. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 487-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22King K. Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6188-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) provide a system in which molecular manipulation is easy and in which receptor activity is simply monitored by means of mating pathway-responsive reporter constructs. Because the heterologous mammalian receptor is the only GPCR that is functionally coupled to the readout and because of the absence of potential mammalian-specific accessory factors, yeast cells are essentially a null system for the reconstitution and study of GPCRs. In this study we have tested whether the yeast system might also be useful in the study of heteromeric GPCRs, allowing for the dissection of the exact contribution of various components to the pharmacological properties of these receptors. We have utilized yeast for the co-expression of CRLR and RAMPs and show functional reconstitution of CGRP and ADM receptors. The following ligands were purchased from Bachem: human βCGRP (H-6730), human αCGRP (H-1470), human ADM (H-2932), rat ADM (H-2934), calcitonin (H-2250), amylin (H-7905), human CGRP-(8–37) (H-9895), and human ADM-(22–52) (H-4144). The human Cys(Acm)2,7 CGRP, human ADM-(13–52), and rat ADM-(11–50) were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in synthetic media (yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, Difco) with the appropriate nutritional supplements and 2% glucose as a carbon source. The medium was buffered at pH 7.2 with 25 mm PIPES.

Strain CY19888 is an stp22-deficient derivative of CY16463 made by standard yeast molecular biological techniques. CRLR and RAMPs were cloned from a heart cDNA library (CLONTECH Quick clone 7121-1). PCRs were performed with Advantage-GC cDNA PCR kit (CLONTECH K1907-1), and the primers were as follows: RAMP1, forward CAGTGGTACCACTCGGCACCGCTGTGCACCATGGCC and reverse CAGTTCTAGACTACACAATGCCCTCAGTGCGCTTGCCTC; RAMP2, forward GATCTTGGTACCATGGCCTCGCTCCGGGTG and reverse GATCTTTCTAGACTAGGCCTGGGCCTCACTGTC; RAMP3, forward CAGTGGTACCATGGAGACTGGAGCGCTGCGG and reverse CAGTTCTAGATCACAGCAGCGTGTCGGTGCG; and CRLR, forward GGGTACCCCACCATGGAGAAAAAGTGTACCTCGTAT and reverse CGGGATCCCGCAAACAGTGAGACAACCATCCTTCTA. We first cloned all the genes into mammalian expression vectors (pcDNA3.1) using theKpnI/XbaI sites introduced in the primers. All constructs were functional when expressed in mammalian cells. CRLR was subcloned into NcoI/XbaI sites of yeast expression vectors CP1289 (2μ ori AmpR LEU2 REP3 PGK-promoter) to create CP5899 and CP4258 (2μ ori AmpR LEU2 REP3 PGK-promoter-MFα1-(1–89)) to create CP5900.

In short, yeast cells were grown overnight to exponential phase and diluted to anA 600 of 0.2. BSA and Bactopeptone were added to a final concentration of 0.1% each. The yeast cells were seeded in 96-well plates in 100 μl final volume and treated with ligands for 4 h at 30 °C. β-Galactosidase activity was determined by the addition of 20 μl of substrate/lysis solution (0.5 mmfluorescein di-β-d-galactopyranoside (Molecular Probes), 2.5% Triton X-100, and 125 mm PIPES, pH 7.2). Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 1 mNa2CO3. Fluorescence was read at an excitation wavelength of 485λ and an emission wavelength of 535λ at optimal gain. Duplicate samples were analyzed and the results shown in the figures are representative of at least two independent experiments. To allow for immunodetection of CRLR, we FLAG-tagged the protein by subcloning the gene into NcoI/XbaI sites of CP3146 (2μ ori AmpR LEU2 REP3 PGK-promoter-FLAG). Membrane extracts from cells expressing CRLR-FLAG alone or in combination with RAMPs were prepared by standard procedures. Briefly, cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase, washed with sterile cold water, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, plus protease inhibitors). Yeast cells were glass bead-disrupted, and extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 2200 rpm for 5 min in a Sorvall RT6000D. Enriched membrane fractions were obtained by centrifugation of the resulting extracts at 48,000 rpm for 30 min in Optima TL Ultracentrifuge (Beckman, rotor TLA 100.3) and resuspension of the pellet in lysis buffer. Protein concentration was determined with the Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad) and endoglycosidase H digestions were performed following the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Western blot analysis was performed by standard procedures, and CRLR-FLAG was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using an Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma A8592). Haploid S. cerevisiae cells contain a cell type-specific seven-transmembrane receptor (Ste2 in MATa cells or Ste3 in MATα cells) coupled to a heterotrimeric G protein that consists of a Gα subunit (GPA1), a Gβ subunit (STE4), and a Gγ subunit (STE18). Stimulation of the receptor by mating factor leads to activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the induction of several genes, including FUS1, a gene involved in fusion of mating partners. By placing thelacZ reporter gene under the control of the FUS1promoter, pathway activity in these cells can be conveniently monitored by measuring β-galactosidase activity (22King K. Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 250: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Functional expression of mammalian GPCRs is typically achieved in cells lacking the endogenous mating factor receptor and containing a yeast/mammalian chimeric G protein. Because CGRP responsiveness in mammalian cells requires co-expression of RAMP1 and CRLR, we created yeast vectors that allow for co-expression of receptor and accessory factor under the control of strong yeast promoters. We used LEU2-marked 2-μm vectors for expression of CRLR from the PGKpromoter and URA3-marked 2-μm vectors for expression of RAMP1 from the ADH promoter. Because many mammalian proteins show improved plasma membrane localization in yeast when they are fused to the α-factor leader sequence, 2J. J. Miret, L. Rakhilina, L. Silverman, and B. Oehlen, unpublished observations. we made expression constructs for CRLR and RAMPs with and without this leader sequence (the resulting vectors are indicated as pCRLR, pMFL-CRLR, pRAMP1 and pMFL-RAMP1). Specific proteases in the Golgi apparatus cleave the α-leader sequence, allowing expression of unmodified proteins at the plasma membrane. The CGRP and ADM receptors couple to Gαs in mammalian cells. We therefore expressed various combinations of CRLR and RAMP1 constructs in a yeast strain that contains a rat Gαs (CY16463) and treated cells with βCGRP for 4 h before measuring β-galactosidase activity. Fig.1 A shows that expression of CRLR or RAMP1 alone did not result in a functional response. However, up to a 10-fold induction of β-galactosidase was observed when CRLR and RAMP1 were co-expressed. The largest induction was found when both CRLR and RAMP1 were expressed without leader sequence (Fig.1 A). We hypothesized that the number of receptors at the plasma membrane might be affected by yeast systems that recognize damaged, misfolded, or heterologous receptors and that target proteins to the vacuole for degradation (27Li Y. Kane T. Tipper C. Spatrick P. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3588-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We have found that functional expression of several mammalian GPCRs in yeast is aided by deletion ofSTP22, a gene involved in this type of “quality control” (27Li Y. Kane T. Tipper C. Spatrick P. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3588-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). 3K. Ostanin, unpublished observations. Therefore, we also tested CRLR and RAMP expression in anstp22-deficient strain (CY19888). Reporter gene expression in the absence of ligand was found to be lower instp22-deficient cells, whereas robust induction of the signal by ligands was still observed (Fig. 1 A). As a consequence, the βCGRP-responsiveness was increased to 30-fold for the CRLR/RAMP1 and 20-fold for the CRLR/MFL-RAMP1 combinations (Fig.1 A). This level of induction appears to be stronger than for the UDP-glucose receptor KIAA0001 (10-fold induction) or the LPA receptor Edg-2 (5-fold induction) coupled in yeast (24Chambers J.K. Macdonald L.E. Sarau H.M. Ames R.S. Freeman K. Foley J.J. Zhu Y. McLaughlin M.M. Murdock P. McMillan L. Trill J. Swift A. Aiyar N. Taylor P. Vawter L. Naheed S. Szekeres P. Hervieu G. Scott C.

We then tested whether the reconstituted receptors responded to βCGRP in a dose-dependent manner. Fig. 1 B shows a classic sigmoidal dose-response curve with an EC50 of 89 ± 30 nm for strain CY16463 carrying pCRLR/pRAMP1. We obtained similar results with the stp22-deficient strain containing either pCRLR/pRAMP1 or pCRLR/pmFL-RAMP1 (data not shown). In every case, the sensitivity of the response was affected by the pH of the incubation media (pH 7.2 was optimal) and the presence of BSA and peptone (data not shown). The addition of BSA and peptone improved the potency of βCGRP somewhat, possibly by preventing nonspecific ligand interactions with yeast cell wall proteins or with the plastic of the reaction wells. Taken together, these data indicate that co-expression of CRLR and RAMP1 is necessary and sufficient for βCGRP responsiveness in yeast. In contrast to RAMP1, co-expression of CRLR with RAMP2 or RAMP3 in mammalian cells results in cAMP production through an ADM receptor. This is the only ADM receptor described to date for which the molecular nature appears to be reasonably clear (13Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 184-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Juaneda C. Dumont Y. Quirion R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To test whether RAMP2 and RAMP3 are sufficient to confer to CRLR the properties of an ADM receptor, we co-expressed various combinations of RAMP2, RAMP3, and CRLR in wild type (CY16463) and stp22-deficient yeast (CY19888), as described above for RAMP1 and CRLR. As observed with the response to CGRP, expression of either RAMP2 or CRLR alone gave no response to ADM, but co-expression of RAMP2 and CRLR resulted in a ligand-dependent signal (Fig.2 A). The optimal responsiveness to ADM (∼10-fold induction in β-galactosidase activity) was observed when CRLR and pMFL-RAMP2 were expressed in anstp22-deficient strain (Fig. 2 A). This combination also responded to agonist in a dose-dependent fashion, displaying a sigmoidal curve with an EC50 of 274 ± 50 nm (Fig. 2 B). The assay had similar pH, BSA, and peptone requirements as the RAMP1/CRLR receptor (data not shown). We performed comparable experiments using CRLR in combination with RAMP3 and observed a 5–10-fold induction of β-galactosidase activity in wild type CY16463 and a 10–15-fold induction in thestp22-deficient CY19888 (Fig.3 A) with an EC50of 115 ± 50 nm (Fig. 3 B). Just as observed in mammalian cells, co-expression of CRLR with either RAMP2 or RAMP3 in yeast resulted in ADM responsiveness. The agonist rank order of potency for different members of the calcitonin family of peptides defines the CGRP receptor. βCGRP and αCGRP are the most potent agonists for this receptor, followed by adrenomedullin and, with significantly lower potency, calcitonin and amylin (29Juaneda C. Dumont Y. Quirion R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We determined the dose-response relationship for these peptides in yeast cells expressing CRLR and RAMP1 (Fig. 4 A). βCGRP was found to be the most potent agonist followed by αCGRP and ADM, whereas calcitonin and amylin did not have any effect. No receptor stimulation was observed with the linear CGRP-related peptide (human Cys(Acm)2,7 CGRP), which has been described as a CGRP2-specific agonist (30Quirion R. Van Rossum D. Dumont Y., St- Pierre S. Fournier A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 657: 88-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The rank order of agonist activity of these peptides is consistent with reconstitution of CGRP receptor pharmacology in yeast. To characterize further the pharmacological properties of the receptor in yeast, we studied the effect of the short CGRP peptide CGRP-(8–37), a well characterized CGRP receptor antagonist (29Juaneda C. Dumont Y. Quirion R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 31Chiba T. Yamaguchi A. Yamatani T. Nakamura A. Morishita T. Inui T.

As observed in mammalian systems, this peptide acted as a competitive antagonist; it inhibited the response to βCGRP (100 nm) in yeast with an IC50 of 4 μm (Fig. 4 B), and addition of increasing concentrations produced an incremental shift of the βCGRP dose-response curves to the right (data not shown). CGRP-(8–37) has been reported to act also as an antagonist when ADM is the ligand for the CGRP receptor. This is a key differentiator between the response of the CGRP receptor to ADM and bona fide ADM recepto"

Thus, Cl− homeostasis determines the efficacy of synaptic inhibition in the motoneurons.In situ hybridization reveals that the neuronal K+-Cl− cotransporter isoform 2 (KCC2), a major mechanism in maintaining a low Cl− concentration in neurons, is abundantly expressed in the facial, hypoglossal (XII), and spinal motoneurons innervating striated muscle, whereas the dorsal vagal motoneurons (DMVs) controlling smooth muscle exhibited little expression of KCC2. This raises a general interest in the correlation between KCC2 expression and inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) performance in the native circuits.

These inhibitory transmitters activate Cl− channels, resulting in hyperpolarization of the motoneurons. Thus, the efficacy of these inhibitions is largely influenced by intracellular Cl−concentration ([Cl−]i) homeostasis. Among the many molecules involved in [Cl−]i homeostasis, K+-Cl− cotransporter isoform 2 (KCC2) is a principal molecule for maintenance of low [Cl−]iin central neurons (1Rivera C. Voipio J. Payne J.A.

Such differences importantly affect the characteristics of IPSPs, including their capacity to both hyperpolarize and shunt inhibition of postsynaptic neurons (8Andersen P. Dingledine R. Gjerstad L. Langmoen I.A. Laursen A.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1980; 305: 279-296Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The developmental shift of GABA responses from depolarization to hyperpolarization was first demonstrated in hippocampal neurons (9Ben-Ari Y. Cherubini E. Corradetti R. Gaiarsa J.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 416: 303-325Crossref Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). [Cl−]i decreases developmentally as a result of changes in such Cl−regulators as Na+-K+-Cl−cotransporter (NKCC) isoform 1 and KCC2 (1Rivera C. Voipio J. Payne J.A. Ruusuvuori E. Lahtinen H. Lamsa K.

The developmental induction of KCC2 function evokes a marked negative shift in the reversal potential of GABA responses (E GABA) in mature neurons and promotes fast hyperpolarizing GABAergic and glycinergic postsynaptic inhibition (1Rivera C. Voipio J. Payne J.A. Ruusuvuori E. Lahtinen H. Lamsa K. Pirvola U. Saarma M. Kaila K. Nature. 1999; 397: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 9Ben-Ari Y. Cherubini E. Corradetti R.

Cell. 2001; 105: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In addition to the developmental changes of GABA and glycine responses associated with changes in KCC and NKCC function, GABA type A (GABAA) receptor-mediated responses differ regionally. In nucleus reticularis thalami neurons, GABAergic IPSPs induce inhibition mainly by shunting rather than by overt hyperpolarization, whereas in thalamocortical neurons, IPSPs are markedly hyperpolarizing (6Ulrich D. Huguenard J.R. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1748-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Such differences in GABA action reflect very differentE GABAs between thalamocortical and reticularis thalamus neurons. In dorsal root ganglion neurons, the high [Cl−]i maintained by NKCC1 causes depolarizing GABA responses (13Sung K.-W. Kirby M. McDonald M.P. Lovinger D.M. Delpire E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7531-7538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these regional differences in GABAergic action may indicate variations of [Cl−]iregulation across these brain nuclei. A recent study demonstrated the essential role of KCC in synaptic inhibition. KCC2 knockout mice have severe motor deficits and abnormal neuronal activity of spinal motoneurons and die due to a failure of respiration (14Hübner C.A. Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Meyer T. Ballanyi K. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Thus, KCC2 is critically involved in the neuronal function of motor neurons innervating striated muscles. In the present study, we evaluated the differences in GABAergic IPSP performance in two groups of motoneurons, one innervating striated muscle and the other controlling smooth muscle, and compared their [Cl−]i regulation. Across these two pools of motoneurons, we found a close correspondence between differences in their Cl− transport properties and activity-dependent IPSP depression along with their KCC2 expression. The motoneurons innervating striated muscles exhibit a potent [Cl−]i controlling system, resulting in the maintenance of constant IPSP efficacy. Our experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of the Japanese Physiological Society. Wistar rats, 16–18 days old, were decapitated under anesthesia with pentobarbitone sodium (55 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), and 400-μm transverse slices of the brain including the hypoglossal (XII) and dorsal vagal motor (DMV) nuclei were prepared with a microslicer (VT-1000S; Leica, Nussloch, Germany). For whole-cell patch clamp recording, XII and DMV neurons were dissociated as described in our previous report (15Ueno T. Ueno S. Kakazu Y. Akaike N. Nabekura J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To assure that the tissue was taken from the XII or DMV nucleus, the micropunches were taken from within the boundaries of the respective nuclei. The resulting isolated neurons retained several original morphological features resembling those described previously for XII and DMV neurons (16Haddad G.G. Donnelly D.F. Getting P.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 69: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Viana F. Gibbs L. Berger A.J. Neuroscience. 1990; 38: 829-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Nabekura J.

The incubation solution for slices contained 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 24 mm NaHCO3 (pH 7.45; 95% O2:5% CO2). The standard external solution used for gramicidin-perforated whole-cell patch clamp recordings contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with Tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane (Tris-base). Because GABAA receptor-gated chloride channels have a permeability to Cl− and HCO3−, we measuredE GABA in the absence of HCO3− to estimate [Cl−]i. For our high K+extracellular solution, KCl was substituted for equimolar NaCl. The micropipettes for intracellular recording were filled with 0.5m potassium acetate. The patch pipette solution for gramicidin-perforated patch recording contained 150 mm KCl and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with Tris-base). Gramicidin was first dissolved in methanol to prepare a stock solution of 10 μg/ml and then diluted to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml for the pipette solution. The gramicidin-containing solution was prepared just before the experiment. For intracellular recording, the electrolyte filling the pipette (50–80 megaohms) was connected via Ag-AgCl electrode to the input stage of an intracellular recording amplifier (IR283; Neuro Data). IPSPs were evoked by a bipolar electrode placed near the nucleus of interest and activated by electrical pulses (100-μs duration) at 32 °C to 34 °C. For gramicidin-perforated whole-cell recordings, ionic currents and voltage were measured with a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-7; List-Electronic) as described in the previous report (11Kakazu Y. Akaike N. Komiyama S. Nabekura J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2843-2851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments on isolated neurons were carried out at room temperature. Drugs used in the present experiments were gramicidin D, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, andd,l-2-amino-5-phosphovaleric acid from Sigma, Pronase from Calbiochem, furosemide from Tokyo Kasei (Tokyo, Japan), and tetrodotoxin from Sankyo (Tokyo, Japan). Rapid change of the external solution was performed with “Y-tube” method described previously (20Nabekura J. Ebihara S. Akaike N. J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The data were presented as the means ± S.E., with n equal to the number of cells studied. Differences between the groups were analyzed for statistical significance using Student’s t test. Values ofp < 0.05 were taken as the standard for a significant difference. Frozen sections of brainstem from 16-day-old Wistar rats were prepared for in situhybridization. To detect the KCC2 transcript, a 189-bp cDNA fragment of rat KCC2 (GenBankTM accession number U55816; position 197–385) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from adult rat cerebral RNA (5′ primer, TTCATCAACAGCACGGACAC; 3′ primer, CTTCTTCTTTCCGCCCTCAT). Digoxigenin-labeled cRNA was used, and in situ hybridizations were performed as described previously (21Suzuki S.O. Iwaki T. Brain Res. Protoc. 1999; 4: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). KCC2 is a neuron-specific K+-Cl− cotransporter involved in active Cl− extrusion (22Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed the expression levels of KCC2 among XII, facial nuclei, and spinal ventral horn as well as the DMV by in situ hybridization in rats (Fig.1). KCC2 mRNA was expressed abundantly in very large neurons of spinal ventral horn, XII, and facial nuclei, whereas KCC2 expression is low in the DMV. This result supports the general hypothesis that motoneurons innervating striated muscle express KCC2 intensely. To examine whether the diversity of KCC2 expression correlates with the difference in Cl− homeostasis and IPSP performance between the two sets of motor neurons, electrophysiological approaches were employed on XII neurons and the DMV. Local field stimulation evoked GABAergic IPSPs in both the XII and DMV neurons. These IPSPs were isolated pharmacologically by the presence of glutamatergic blockade with 10−5m6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and 10−5m d,l-2-amino-5-phosphovaleric acid. Varying membrane potentials induced by passing current through the recording electrode altered the amplitude and direction of the IPSPs. E IPSPs in the XII and DMV neurons were −73 ± 4 mV (n = 7) and −64 ± 3 mV (n = 6), respectively (Fig.2). These very differentE IPSPs (p < 0.05) occurred despite no differences in the resting membrane potential between XII and DMV neurons (−63 ± 4 mV (n = 7) and −62 ± 3 mV (n = 6), respectively). Repetitive activation of the GABAergic afferents at 3.3 Hz for 30–60 s evoked characteristically different responses in the two types of neuron. During repetitive stimulation, IPSP amplitude gradually declined to reach a steady value during stimulation (Fig. 2,A and B) in both XII and DMV neurons. However, the degree of decline in IPSP amplitude was significantly greater in DMV neurons (23 ± 7% of the first IPSP; n = 6; Fig. 2 B) than in XII neurons (66 ± 11% of the first IPSP; n = 7; Fig. 2 A). In the recovery phase, at 20 s after the end of repetitive stimulation (<1 min), E IPSP averaged −72 ± 3 mV (n = 7) in XII neurons and −56 ± 4 mV (n = 6) in DMV neurons (Fig. 2, C andD). E IPSPs before and after repetitive stimulation were different in DMV (p < 0.05), but not in XII (p > 0.1). Multiple possible mechanisms, such as transmitter release probability and GABAA receptor desensitization, might contribute to this difference in IPSP depression during repetitive stimulation. However, a depolarizing shift of E IPSP could account for the rapid loss of efficacy of the IPSP that was greater in the DMV than in XII neurons. In the presence of 1 mm furosemide,E IPSP shifted significantly to a more depolarized level even in the XII (8.1 ± 3.1 mV;n = 3). To examine the potential mechanisms underlying the differences in E IPSP performance between XII and DMV neurons, we assessed [Cl−]iusing gramicidin-perforated patch recordings of acutely dissociated XII and DMV neurons. E GABAs were measured using voltage ramps (from −100 to 0 mV, 2-s duration) applied before and during 10 μm GABA application starting from a holding potential (V H) of −50 mV (Fig.3 A, right panel). GABA induced outward currents at aV H of −50 mV in both XII and DMV neurons (Fig.3 A, left panel). GABA-induced currents (I GABAs) were eliminated by bicuculline (1 μm), a GABAA receptor antagonist, in all neurons. As a result, I GABA was found to be a Cl− current conducted through GABAA receptors. Cl− moves through GABA-activated channels according to its electrochemical potential across the membrane. The recovery of the neuron from such fluxes to its resting state occurs due to various means of Cl− transport. We repetitively applied 10 μm GABA to XII and DMV neurons at an interval of 5 min and measured the amplitude of each I GABA. In DMV neurons, the amplitude of I GABA gradually declined, and I GABA was nearly completely depressed at the fifth GABA application (Fig. 3 A, left panel). In contrast, I GABA was maintained at an almost constant amplitude in XII neurons. E GABA was assumed to equal the Cl−equilibrium potential (E Cl), and this allowed us to calculate the [Cl−]i by using the Nernst equation using our measured E GABA and known extracellular Cl− concentration ([Cl−]o = 161 mm) in each neuron (11Kakazu Y. Akaike N. Komiyama S. Nabekura J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2843-2851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ebihara S. Shirato K. Harata N. Akaike N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484: 77-86Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The calculated [Cl−]i shifted after each GABA application, but the magnitude of the change was very different between XII and DMV neurons (Fig. 3 B). The changes in [Cl−]i between the first and fifth GABA applications were 0.35 ± 0.39 mm (n = 4; p > 0.1) and 4.4 ± 0.12 mm(n = 4; p < 0.01) at XII and DMV neurons, respectively. This indicates that although the GABA-associated Cl− influx leads to a net accumulation of intracellular Cl− (minimizing the steady-state Cl− gradient across the membrane), this loaded Cl− was extruded more effectively across from XII neurons to allow recovery within the 5-min test cycle. However, increasing the rate of repetitive GABA application to 1-min intervals effectively raised [Cl−]ieven in XII neurons (Fig. 3 C, ●). Conversely, decreasing the interval to 20 min allowed DMV neurons to maintain an almost constant [Cl−]i (Fig. 3 C, ○). To more directly examine the efficacy of Cl− extrusion, we measured the recovery of E GABA using a defined level of loading Cl−. Increasing the duration of application of 3 × 10−4m GABA (approximately 1 min) brought E GABA close toV H (−50 mV) and resulted in diminished GABA responses in both XII and DMV neurons (Fig.4, A and B,i). At 5 min after GABA application,E GABA achieved more negative values in the XII than in the DMV (Fig. 4 B, ii). The calculated [Cl−]i reduction 5 min after Cl−loading was significantly greater in the XII (6.36 ± 0.82 mm; n = 7) than in the DMV (2.23 ± 0.91 mm; n = 7; p < 0.05, unpaired t test). Such results are consistent with the substantial difference in the capacity for Cl− extrusion in these two groups of neurons. In XII neurons, the amplitude ofI GABA was maintained at a constant level during repetitive GABA applications at an interval of 5 min (Fig.3 A, left panel). However, in the presence of 1 mm furosemide, the amplitude ofI GABA decreased rapidly (Fig.5 A, top panel). This decrease in I GABA resulted from a marked shift of E GABA toward V H(−50 mV; Fig. 5 B, top panel). At DMV neurons, furosemide also shifted E GABA towardV H (n = 3). These results indicate that furosemide-sensitive Cl− transport mechanisms play a major role in regulating [Cl−]i in both XII and DMV neurons. The differences in Cl− regulation between both types of neurons could be accounted for by differences in the expression of furosemide-sensitive mechanisms, i.e.cation-Cl− cotransporters. To verify that a high expression of KCC2 reflects low [Cl−]i in XII neurons, we examined the effect of extracellular K+ on Cl− regulation. The efficacy and direction of KCC activity are dependent on the driving force for K+ across the membrane (5Thompson S.M. Gähwiler B.H. J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 512-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Kakazu Y. Akaike N. Komiyama S. Nabekura J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2843-2851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kakazu Y. Uchida S. Nakagawa T. Akaike N. Nabekura J. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In XII neurons, increasing the extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) from 5 to 30 mm promptly reduced the amplitude of I GABA and finally reversed GABA responses inward at a V H of −50 mV (Fig. 5 A, bottom panel).E GABA shifted to more depolarized values from −70 mV with 5 mm K+ to −43 mV at the third GABA application with 30 mm K+ in response to the associated reversal of the driving force for Cl− (Fig.5 B, bottom panel, ●). However, 20 mm [K+]o simply reduced the amplitude of I GABA but failed to reverse the GABA response and driving force for Cl− (Fig. 5 B,bottom panel, ▴). Returning to [K+]o of 5 mm promptly returnedE GABA to a value similar to that seen before the increased [K+]o. Such results are consistent with the participation of the K+-dependent and furosemide-sensitive [Cl−]i extrusion of KCC. Although a similar alteration of E GABA by [K+]o manipulation was observed in DMV neurons, the effect of [K+]o change onE GABA appeared to be greater in the XII (Fig.5 B, bottom panel). Resting values for E IPSP (Fig. 2,C and D) and EGABA were more negative in the XII than in the DMV. E GABAs measured with the first application of GABA after dissociation were −81.4 ± 2.8 mV (n = 8) in XII and −62.2 ± 3.6 mV (n = 8) in DMV. Calculated resting [Cl−]i for XII neurons was significantly lower than that of DMV neurons (5.6 ± 0.6 mm(n = 8) and 12.5 ± 1.9 mm(n = 8), respectively; p < 0.01). However, the different steady-state [Cl−]i could not be accounted for simply by differing KCC function. TheE Cl driven only by KCC was calculated to be −85 mV in both types of neurons under our experimental conditions, in which intracellular K+ concentration ([K+]i), [K+]o, and [Cl−]o were 150, 5, and 161 mm, respectively (25Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Russel J.M. Chloride Channels and Carriers in Nerve, Muscle and Glial Cells. Plenum, New York1990: 109-158Google Scholar). Increases in [Cl−]i by GABAAreceptor activation shifted E GABA to approachV H (−60 mV) in the presence of furosemide and resulted in diminished GABA responses (Fig.6 A, i). Thereafter, V H was stepped to −40 mV. Significant increases of E GABA at 5 min after this voltage jump and in the presence of furosemide were observed in both groups of neurons (p < 0.01, paired ttest; Fig. 6 B). Such results indicate the existence of furosemide-insensitive [Cl−]i regulation, including passive Cl− conductance, in both neurons that brings E Cl toward V H. Together, the results suggest a diversity of KCC2 function and different resting states for [Cl−]i between the XII and DMV. This seems to be the result of different balances between Cl− extrusion by KCC2 and Cl− accumulation by furosemide-insensitive mechanisms. More active KCC2 function could contribute to a more negative set point of restingE Cl in the XII. KCC, NKCC, Cl−-HCO3− exchange, Na+-dependent Cl−-HCO3− exchange, Cl−-ATPase, and passive Cl− conductance are involved in [Cl−]i regulation of neurons (26Kaila K. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 42: 489-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 27Inagaki C. Hara M. Zeng X. J. Exp. Zool. 1996; 275: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we used HEPES-buffered solutions without HCO3−. Thus, HCO3−-dependent Cl− regulators are likely to be negligible contributors under the conditions of the present studies. In the present study,E GABA was brought close to −53.3 ± 0.1 mV (n = 3) with 20 mm[K+]o in the XII neurons (Fig.5 B, bottom panel). This value (E GABA = −53.3 mV) was similar toV H (−50 mV) and the calculated value ofE Cl regulated only by KCC with 20 mm[K+]o and 150 mm[K+]i (−51 mV). In addition, increasing [K+]o to 30 mm reversed GABA responses inward (Fig. 5 A), a finding that could be explained by the reversed direction of Cl− transport by KCC (24Kakazu Y. Uchida S. Nakagawa T. Akaike N. Nabekura J. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, our results indicate that the furosemide-sensitive and K+-dependent Cl− extrusion mechanism observed in both neurons is mainly KCC. In evaluating the activity of extrusion of accumulated Cl−, repetitive GABA application at an interval of 5 min gradually increased [Cl−]i in the DMV neurons, but not in the XII neurons (Fig. 3 B). With longer intervals of GABA application, an increase of [Cl−]i was less apparent at DMV neurons (Fig. 3 C). Thus, we suggest that a furosemide- and [K+]o-sensitive extrusion Cl− mechanism also exists in the DMV neuron but is less active than that in the XII. In addition to regional diversity of [Cl−]i regulation (Figs. 2 and 3), frequency-dependent [Cl−]i shift by repetitive Cl− channel activation is also demonstrated in developing neurons, in which a young neuron with a less efficient Cl− regulation mechanism needs a longer interval to maintain original [Cl−]i than mature neurons (28Ehrlich I. Löhrke S. Friauf E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 121-137Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). KCC2 is specifically localized to neurons and displays unique functional characteristics, including a lack of swelling activation and a high affinity for external K+(22Payne J.A. Am. J.

The NKCC isoform expressed in the brain is NKCC1 (31Xu J.C. Lytle C. Zhu T.T. Payne J.A. Benz E., Jr. Forbush III., B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2201-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 32Lytle C., Xu, J.C. Biemesderfer B. Forbush III., B. Am. J.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C173-C183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, KCC2 mRNA was more prominently expressed in XII neurons than in DMV neurons (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the expression level of NKCC1 mRNA was lower in both neuron types (data not shown). The possible mechanisms for the apparent difference in activity of Cl− extrusion between XII and DMV neurons are: 1) differences in the density of the molecule (KCC2) expressed in the membrane, and 2) differences in the activity of each molecule to extrude Cl−. The activity of KCC1 is regulated by protein phosphorylation (34Starke L.C. Jennings M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C118-C124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Flatman P.W. Adragna N.C. Lauf P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C255-C263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether neuronal KCC, KCC2, is affected by phosphorylation in function is controversial. In Xenopus oocytes, tyrosine phosphorylation does not affect KCC2 function (36Strange K. Singer T.D. Morrison R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C860-C867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas tyrosine kinase may regulate Cl− extrusion in cultured hippocampal neurons (37Kelsch W. Hormuzdi S. Staube E. Lewen A. Monyer H. Misgeld U. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8339-8347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our electrophysiological and in situ hybridization results suggest that the amount of KCC2 expression appears to correlate with the functional activity of Cl− extrusion. XII neurons possess more active Cl− extrusion driven by more abundant KCC2 molecules than DMV neurons. GABAergic and glycinergic IPSP inhibition varies in such properties as amplitude and duration. One of the postsynaptic mechanisms that affect the properties of IPSPs is the difference between membrane potential andE Cl. We observed differing decreases in GABAergic IPSP magnitude during repetitive stimulation in XII and DMV neurons (Fig. 2). The depression of GABAergic IPSPs might be accounted for by several mechanisms, i.e. an accumulation of [Cl−]i, an elevation of [K+]o that may decrease the driving force for KCC (5Thompson S.M. Gähwiler B.H. J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 512-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), a decrease in the presynaptic GABA release induced by GABAB receptor (38Thompson S.M. Gähwiler B.H. J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), or a desensitization of postsynaptic GABAA receptor (39McCarren M. Alger B.E. J. Neurophysiol. 1985; 53: 557-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 40Thompson S.M. Gähwiler B.H. J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, the present study suggests that greater subsynaptic [Cl−]i(decreased driving force) brought about by less Cl−extrusion (less KCC2) might contribute to rapid IPSP depression in the DMV because KCC2 is well colocalized with GABAA receptor in the neurons (29Williams J.R. Sharp J.W. Kumari V.G. Wilson M. Payne J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12656-12664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Differences in excitable properties between DMV and XII motoneurons have been reported. DMV neurons control smooth muscle activity with a transient K+ current, resulting in a long after hyperpolarization, thus leading to a slow reduction of the firing rate. On the other hand, XII neurons innervating striated muscle lack this transient K+ current, and this favors a higher frequency firing without any delay upon depolarization (41Jiang C. Cummins T.R. Haddad G.G. Exp. Brain Res. 1994; 100: 407-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the study using KCC2 knockout mice, KCC2 is vital for motoneurons to maintain normal striated muscle activity (14Hübner C.A. Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Meyer T. Ballanyi K. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In the present studies, XII neurons with more KCC activity displayed more hyperpolarization of GABAergic responses and less depression of IPSP during repetitive GABAergic afferent stimulation than DMV neurons. Together with high expression of KCC mRNA in facial and spinal motoneurons, a larger hyperpolarization and less depression of GABAergic IPSPs might contribute to a rapid and constant on-off of firing in motoneurons driving striated muscles.

https://openalex.org/W2032547020,"DNA topoisomerase I (Top1p) catalyzes topological changes in DNA and is the cellular target of the antitumor agent camptothecin (CPT). Non-CPT drugs that target Top1p, such as indolocarbazoles, are under clinical development. However, whether the cytotoxicity of indolocarbazoles derives from Top1p poisoning remains unclear. To further investigate indolocarbazole mechanism, rebeccamycin R-3 activity was examined <i>in vitro</i> and in yeast. Using a series of Top1p mutants, where substitution of residues around the active site tyrosine has well-defined effects on enzyme catalysis, we show that catalytically active, CPT-resistant enzymes remain sensitive to R-3. This indolocarbazole did not inhibit yeast Top1p activity, yet was effective in stabilizing Top1p·DNA complexes. Similar results were obtained with human Top1p, when Ser or His were substituted for Asn-722. The mutations altered enzyme function and sensitivity to CPT, yet R-3 poisoning of Top1p was unaffected. Moreover, <i>top1</i>Δ, <i>rad52</i>Δ yeast cells expressing human Top1p, but not catalytically inactive Top1Y723Fp, were sensitive to R-3. These data support hTop1p as the cellular target of R-3 and indicate that distinct drug·enzyme interactions at the active site are required for efficient poisoning by R-3 or CPT. Furthermore, resistance to one poison may potentiate cell sensitivity to structurally distinct compounds that also target Top1p."

It has long been recognized that hypothalamic GnRH controls gonadal steroidogenesis and ovarian follicular development by stimulating the production of gonadotropins from the pituitary. More recently, the presence of extra-pituitary GnRH has been appreciated. Low levels of GnRH expression have been found in peripheral reproductive tissues, such as placenta (1Radovick S.

The extremely low levels of expression in the peripheral tissues along with the paucity and scattered distribution of GnRH neurons have limited thein vivo study of GnRH gene regulation. In the adult mouse brain, it has been estimated that GnRH expression is limited to only 800 neurons (3Wray S. Grant P. Gainer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In the adult, the vast majority of the GnRH neurons are located in the basal hypothalamus and septum, but GnRH neurons have been described along the migratory pathway from the olfactory bulbs, as well as in the cerebral cortex and limbic system (3Wray S. Grant P. Gainer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 4Schwanzel-Fukuda M. Pfaff D.W.

Serono Symposia: Modes Of Action Of GnRH And GnRH Analogs. Springer-Verlag, New York1994Google Scholar). Several in vitro studies have used mouse-derived immortalized GnRH-secreting neuronal cell lines to investigate the neuronal expression of the rat and mouse GnRH gene. Transient transfection studies using the rat GnRH (rGnRH) gene promoter identified a 173-bp proximal promoter region (6Eraly S.A. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 848-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a 300-bp region located 1.8 kb upstream from the transcription start site that conferred cell-specific expression (7Whyte D.B.

Both these sites were reported to be important for the correct neuronal expression of the rGnRH genein vitro (8Nelson S.B. Lawson M.A. Kelley C.G. Mellon P.L. Mol.

These in vitro studies have identified several transcription factors that interact with these promoter regions to regulate rGnRH expression: C/EBPβ (9Belsham D.D. Mellon P.L. Mol.

These two promoter regions are highly conserved between the rat and mouse, andin vitro studies with the mouse GnRH (mGnRH) gene promoter suggest that Oct-1 may also regulate the neuronal expression of the mGnRH gene (16Chandran U.R.

Ultimately, these in vitro studies are unlikely to reflect the elaborate intricacy of in vivo GnRH gene regulation. In the brain, GnRH neurons are dispersed and are influenced by the growth factors, steroids, and neurotransmitters secreted by the various adjacent cell types. Our laboratory has developed previously anin vivo model to study the regulation of the human GnRH (hGnRH) gene in transgenic mice and localized a cell-specific element between −1131 bp and −484 bp of the hGnRH gene (17Wolfe A.M. Wray S. Westphal H. Radovick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20018-20023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A transgenic mouse study identified the critical elements for expression of the mGnRH gene between −2.1 kb and −1.7 kb of the distal 5′-sequence (18Pape J.R. Skynner M.J. Allen N.D. Herbison A.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2203-2211PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the human and mouse cell-specific regions bear little homology to each other, and neither share homology with the critical rat promoter regions identified in the in vitrostudies. To reconcile these discrepant observations, we constructed transgenic mice with fragments of the mGnRH gene promoter fused to the luciferase (LUC) reporter gene (19de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). Here we report that the proximal −1005 bp of the mGnRH promoter contains the critical elements for hypothalamic expression of mGnRH. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DNA sequences contained within the proximal −1005 bp are also sufficient to direct mGnRH expression to the ovary. Our study in the mGnRH-LUC mice is the first to define a region of the GnRH promoter that directs GnRH expression to both neural and non-neural tissues in vivo. Unless otherwise indicated, all chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) unless otherwise specified. A GnRH promoter-luciferase construct containing −3446 to +23 bp of the mouse GnRH promoter fused to pSV0aLΔ5′ luciferase was kindly provided by Dr. Donald B. DeFranco (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA). The −2078/+23-bp construct was produced by restriction enzyme digestion with BamHI andBglII to remove the sequences between −3446 bp and −2078 bp of the mGnRH promoter. The resulting DNA was re-ligated to generate a BamHI/BglII site. Appropriate ligation was verified by DNA sequencing analysis. The −1005/+28-bp mGnRH-luciferase construct was generated as aHindIII fragment using PCR and the −3446/+23 mGnRH-pSV0aLΔ5′ construct as template. PCR was performed in a thermocycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, GeneAmp PCR System 9600), and reaction mixtures contained 5 units of Taq polymerase (DisplayTaq, Display Systems Biotech, Vista, CA) and 0.5 mmdNTPs. The PCR product was restriction enzyme-digested withHindIII and ligated into a HindIII-linearized, alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)-dephosphorylated pA3LUC reporter vector (20Maxwell I.H. Harrison G.S. Wood W.M. Maxwell F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 276-280PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wood W.M. Kao M.Y. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14840-14847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Orientation was checked by sequencing constructs using a primer annealing to the 5′ end of the luciferase gene. For the −3446mGnRH-LUC and −2078mGnRH-LUC DNA constructs, the surrounding plasmid was removed from the mGnRH-luciferase fragment byNdeI and Xmn1 double digestion. For the −1005 mGnRH-LUC construct, PvuI digestion was used to isolate it from the surrounding plasmid. The resulting DNA was electrophoresed, and the linear mGnRH-luciferase DNA fragment was excised from the gel, isolated by electroelution into a dialysis membrane (Invitrogen), and purified on an Elutip-D column (Schleicher & Schuell). Transgenic animals were constructed by the Beth Israel Transgenic Facility by pronuclear injection. Fertilized mouse oocytes from FVB-N mice were injected with the purified linear mGnRH-LUC DNA fragment. The resulting embryos were transferred into pseudo-pregnant foster mothers. Transgenic animals were identified with Southern blot analysis as described previously (17Wolfe A.M. Wray S. Westphal H. Radovick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20018-20023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA was isolated from tail snips, and restriction enzyme was digested with EcoRI and separated with gel electrophoresis. DNA was then transferred to GeneScreen Plus hybridization transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A 32P-labeled 1.2-kb probe for luciferase was used to detect transgenic animals that incorporated the luciferase transgene. For identification of luciferase-expressing transgenic lines, neonatal brains were removed from pups, homogenized, and assayed for the mGnRH-luciferase transgene as described below. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committees of Children's Hospital, Boston, and The University of Chicago. From adult mice, the hypothalamus was dissected in a single fragment consisting of tissue from 1 mm caudal to the mammillary bodies to a point just anterior of the optic chiasm, 1 mm laterally beyond the lateral aspect of the median eminence, and 3 mm dorsally. The olfactory tissue was dissected to include both olfactory bulbs and the tissue rostral to the hypothalamic section. Small representative sections were taken from the remaining tissues. In the case of the gonads, entire gonads were used due to their small size. Similarly, for examination of neonatal luciferase expression, the entire brain was removed from 2- to 3-day-old pups bearing the mGnRH-LUC transgene. Tissues were placed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mmglycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mmEGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and homogenized with a Polytron tissue homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments). The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase assays were done using a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold Systems Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Samples were injected with 100 μl of 0.75 mm luciferin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), dissolved in lysis buffer, and 100 μl of assay buffer (25 mmglycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mmEGTA, 15 mm KPO4, 3 mmdithiothreitol, and 3 mm ATP), and luminescence was measured for 20 s as relative light units (RLU). For some experiments, RLU were normalized for tissue size by correcting for protein content. Protein assays were done using Bio-Rad reagent and bovine serum albumin standards. Brains and ovaries were fixed in situ by perfusing adult mice with a 10% buffered formalin phosphate solution (Fisher). After perfusion, the brains or ovaries were removed and stored overnight in the perfusion solution with 10–15% sucrose. Frozen sections were obtained using a Leica SM2000R sliding microtome. Brain (30 μm) and ovarian (20 μm) sections were collected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Immunocytochemistry using antibodies specific for luciferase and GnRH peptides was performed to co-localize these peptides in the hypothalamus. All incubations were done on a shaking platform. Brain sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with goat anti-luciferase antibody (Cortex Biochemical, San Leandro, CA) at a concentration of 1–3 μg/ml diluted in PBS with 0.3% Triton X and 1% bovine serum albumin. Sections were washed in PBS, and luciferase immunoreactivity was amplified by incubating with biotinylated horse anti-goat IgG (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA) at room temperature for 2 h at a concentration of 6.75 μg/ml PBS with 0.3% Triton-X. Sections were washed in PBS and then incubated with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 h at a concentration of 5 μg/ml PBS. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:5,000 dilution of GnRH antibody (LR5 rabbit anti-GnRH decapeptide antibody kindly provided by Robert Benoit) in blocking solution of PBS with 0.3% Triton X and 1% bovine serum albumin. Sections were washed with PBS at room temperature and then were incubated with 3 μl/ml Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 2 h and followed by a PBS wash. For the detection of luciferase protein in the ovaries, ovarian sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-luciferase antibody (Cortex Biochemical, San Leandro, CA) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml diluted in PBS with 0.3% Triton-X and 1% bovine serum albumin. Sections were washed in PBS and then incubated with 3 μl/ml Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h and followed by a PBS wash. Tissue sections were mounted on slides and coverslipped with vectashield mounting reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The edges of the coverslips were then sealed with standard nail polish. The double fluorescence histology sections were analyzed on a Zeiss Axiovert SS100TV inverted fluorescent microscope, and images were captured with a Zeiss video camera with a CCD chip. The Cy3 and Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescences were visualized using the appropriate filters. A DNA construct containing the region from −3446 bp to +23 bp of the mGnRH promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene was used to generate transgenic mice (−3446mGnRH-LUC). As shown in Table I, Southern blot analysis identified four separate founder lines that incorporated the luciferase transgene. Because luciferase expression is under the control of the mGnRH promoter, mGnRH promoter activity can be detected easily by measuring the luciferase activity in tissue homogenates. To identify founder lines expressing the mGnRH-LUC transgene, whole brain homogenates were obtained from neonatal mice and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was measured as RLU. Two −3446mGnRH-LUC founder lines were found to express luciferase. In brain homogenates from 2- to 3-day-old pups, luciferase activity was 22,309 ± 1042 RLU in the lower expressing line and 43,488 ± 4762 in the higher expressing line. Luciferase activity in the founder lines that did not express luciferase (19.3 ± 7.4 RLU) did not differ from background levels.Table IEffect of mGnRH promoter fragment on expression of luciferase transgene in the neonatal mouse brainMouse GnRH-LUC constructNumber transgenic lines generatedNumber luciferase-expressing lines generatedLine with lowest neonatal luciferase activityLine with highest neonatal luciferase activityLuciferase activity in non-luciferase-expressing miceRLURLURLU−3446 mGnRH-LUC4222,309 ± 1,04243,448 ± 4,76219.3 ± 7.4(n = 48)(n = 55)(n = 20)−2078 mGnRH-LUC1781,500 ± 10412,983 ± 59925.2 ± 8.7(n = 2)(n = 4)(n = 77)−1005 mGnRH-LUC637,044 ± 47222,259 ± 5,87229.3 ± 9.1(n = 3)(n = 3)(n = 24)Three different mouse GnRH promoter fragments were fused to the luciferase reporter gene and used to generate transgenic mouse lines.

Luciferase activity, in brain homogenates from non-luciferase expressing lines, was similar to background levels. In the mGnRH-LUC mice, the anatomic pattern of luciferase expression is an assay of mGnRH promoter activity. As illustrated in Fig.1 A, a similar anatomic pattern of luciferase expression was found in offspring from both founders that expressed the −3446mGnRH-LUC transgene. Data from three female offspring of founder 1 and four female offspring of founder 2 are shown. As expected, high levels of luciferase activity were seen in the hypothalamus (20,148 ± 6093 and 21,263 ± 8214) and olfactory lobes (10,255 ± 1117 and 15,957 ± 3782) when luciferase expression is under the control of the mGnRH promoter. Luciferase activity was detected in the cortex (2771 ± 1505 and 12,572 ± 4027), cerebellum (893 ± 214 and 3807 ± 1255), and midbrain (668 ± 184 and 1427 ± 773). With the exception of the ovary, which had low levels of luciferase activity (154 ± 24 and 41 ± 13), luciferase levels in the other tissues, including the testes, as shown in Fig.2 A, did not differ from background levels. These two lines of −3446mGnRH-LUC mice demonstrate that −3446 bp of the mGnRH promoter targets luciferase expression appropriately to GnRH-containing regions of the mouse brain.Figure 2Ovarian luciferase expression in −1005mGnRH-LUC mice. Ovarian sections were incubated with rabbit anti-luciferase antibody or nonspecific rabbit IgG. Immunoreactivity was detected by anti-rabbit Cy3, which is seen as redfluorescence. A shows a low power (×100) magnification of a representative ovarian section. Luciferase immunoreactivity is seen specifically within two follicles. B and C show the two luciferase-containing follicles at higher magnification (×200). At this higher magnification, it is clear that Cy3 fluorescence is contained within the ovarian granulosa cells.D and E show similar follicles from an ovarian section incubated with nonspecific rabbit IgG. No specific staining of the granulosa cells is seen. There does, however, appear to be some nonspecific staining of the oocyte.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that luciferase expression was confined to GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus, double-labeling immunocytochemistry experiments were performed in the −3446mGnRH-LUC mice. Brain sections from the −3446mGnRH-LUC mice were labeled with antibodies specific for luciferase and GnRH peptides. A representative neuron is shown in Fig.1 B. Luciferase expression was found only in association with GnRH-containing neurons demonstrating that luciferase expression does faithfully reflect mGnRH expression. To define further the promoter element necessary to target hypothalamic luciferase expression, transgenic mice were generated using the proximal −1005 bp of the mGnRH promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (−1005mGnRH-LUC). As shown in Table I, six separate founder lines bearing the −1005mGnRH-LUC transgene were generated, and three transgenic lines were found to express luciferase in the neonatal brain. In brain homogenates from 2- to 3-day-old pups, luciferase levels were 7044 ± 472 RLU in the lowest luciferase-expressing line and 22,259 ± 5872 in the highest luciferase-expressing line. In founder lines that incorporated, but did not express the luciferase transgene, luciferase activity was 29.3 ± 9.1 RLU in neonatal brain homogenates. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the anatomic pattern of luciferase expression was similar in the three luciferase-expressing lines. Data from two female offspring of founder 1 and four female offspring of founders 2 and 3 are shown. This smaller fragment of the mGnRH promoter, containing the proximal −1005 bp, also targets luciferase expression to the hypothalamus (584 ± 77, 1221 ± 353, and 1244 ± 104), but lower levels were seen. Hypothalamic luciferase levels were 16–36-fold higher in the transgenic mice bearing the −3446mGnRH-LUC transgene (20,148 ± 6093 and 21,263 ± 8214). Although the mice generated with the −1005mGnRH-LUC transgene expressed much lower levels of luciferase, immunocytochemistry studies detected luciferase in GnRH-containing neurons, and a representative neuron is shown in Fig. 1 D. As with the transgenic mice generated with −3446 bp of the mGnRH gene promoter, luciferase expression in the hypothalamus was found only in association with GnRH-containing neurons demonstrating that luciferase expression does faithfully reflect mGnRH expression. Analysis of the −1005mGnRH-LUC mice demonstrates that the proximal −1005 bp of the mGnRH promoter targets luciferase expression to hypothalamic GnRH-containing neurons, suggesting that the mGnRH hypothalamic specific element is located within the proximal −1005 bp of the mGnRH promoter. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 1 C, offspring from the three luciferase-expressing founder lines of the −1005mGnRH-LUC mice demonstrated very high levels of luciferase activity in their ovarian homogenates (13,641 ± 652, 12,432 ± 1477, and 32,893 ± 5557). Luciferase activity in the other non-neural tissues was similar to background levels, indicating that ovarian luciferase was not an artifact of where the luciferase transgene incorporated into the mouse genome. The high level of ovarian luciferase expression seen in the mice bearing the −1005mGnRH-LUC transgene was somewhat surprising because there was minimal ovarian expression (154 ± 24 and 41 ± 13) found in the transgenic mice bearing the −3446mGnRH-LUC transgene (Fig. 1 A). No significant ovarian luciferase expression was detected in the −3446mGnRH-LUC mice even after additional female mice (n = 22) from both founder lines bearing the −3446mGnRH-LUC transgene were examined (data not shown). The additional female mice ranged from 24 to 296 days in age and included lactating (n = 4), pregnant (n = 3), pre-pubertal (n = 4), and cycling females (n = 11). These findings demonstrate that the proximal −1005 bp of the mGnRH promoter targets luciferase expression to the ovary, as well as the hypothalamus, suggesting that the GnRH ovarian-specific element is also located within the proximal −1005 bp of the mGnRH promoter. Furthermore, removal of the distal mGnRH promoter region, between −3446 bp and −1005 bp, unmasks ovarian luciferase activity in the −1005mGnRH-LUC mice. Our results suggest that the ovary may expresses GnRH at low levels because low levels of luciferase expression were detected in the −3446mGnRH-LUC mice. This finding suggests that DNA sequences in the distal mGnRH promoter, between −3446 bp and −1005 bp, may normally act as an ovarian GnRH repressor element to mediate the repression of ovarian GnRH. To identify the luciferase-expressing cells in the ovary, immunocytochemistry experiments were performed using adult cycling female mice bearing the −1005mGnRH-LUC transgene. Initially, ovarian sections were labeled with antibodies specific for luciferase and GnRH peptides using the staining protocol used for the brain sections. Luciferase immunoreactivity was amplified using biotinylated secondary antibody with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488. GnRH immunoreactivity was visualized using Cy3 fluorescence. In these studies, no immunostaining for GnRH was detected (data not shown). Additionally, immunostaining for luciferase could not be determined because there was a great deal of nonspecific Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence seen in our control sections, presumably from the endogenous biotin present in the ovary (data not shown). The immunocytochemistry protocol was modified to eliminate the biotinylated secondary antibody. Ovarian sections were obtained from an adult cycling female mouse. Experimental sections were incubated with an anti-luciferase antibody, whereas control sections were incubated with nonspecific rabbit IgG. Immunoreactivity was detected by Cy3 fluorescence. Representative ovarian follicles are shown in Fig. 2. In the mice bearing the −1005mGnRH-LUC transgene, no ovarian staining was found in mice labeled with nonspecific IgG. In sections incubated with the anti-luciferase antibody, fluorescence was detected in the granulosa cells of some ovarian follicles. The fact that only certain follicles within the ovary contained labeled granulosa cells suggests that the luciferase expression seen in these mice is not the result of nonspecific transgene expression. Our findings suggest that increased GnRH promoter activity occurs in the granulosa cells of certain ovarian follicles, either at particular stages of follicular development or within a particular cohort of ovarian follicles. To define further the promoter element necessary to repress ovarian luciferase expression, transgenic mice were generated with the region between −2078 bp and +23 bp of the mGnRH promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (−2078mGnRH-LUC). As shown in Table I, Southern blot analysis identified 17 separate founders bearing the −2078mGnRH-LUC transgene, and luciferase expression was detected in neonatal brains from 8 of these founder lines. In brain homogenates from 2-day-old pups, luciferase activity was 1500 ± 104 RLU in the lowest luciferase-expressing line and 12,983 ± 599 RLU in the highest luciferase-expressing line. In neonatal brain homogenates from founder lines that incorporated, but did not express the luciferase transgene, luciferase activity was 25.2 ± 8.7 RLU. The founder line that consis"

The similarities are limited to the NH2-terminal 300 amino acids of Topo V and are most convincing in the region surrounding active site tyrosines of Topo V and recombinases. The recombinases are mechanistically related to type IB topoisomerases as, similar to topoisomerases, they make a covalent intermediate in which the 3′-phosphoryl group of DNA is esterified to the hydroxyl group of the conserved tyrosine residue (15Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar,16Craig N.L. Nash H.A.

Gardner J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 908-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and its truncated mutant, which lacks the COOH-terminal seven amino acids, has increased topoisomerase activity (18Pargellis C.A. Nunes-Duby S.E. de Vargas L.M. Landy A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7678-7685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further examine the domain structure of Topo V, we subjected the recombinant enzyme to limited proteolysis at different temperatures with endoproteinase Glu-C, trypsin, and thermolysin. The digestion patterns show that the topoisomerase core domain is a globular, tightly folded segment of the Topo V protein, while the COOH-terminal HhH-containing part is sensitive to proteolysis and is organized into several subdomains. We also find that noncovalent binding of duplex DNA results in protection of the COOH-terminal domains from proteolysis. We demonstrate that the Topo V proteins lacking different parts of HhH domain remain fully active in relaxation of supercoiled DNA but become extremely sensitive to high salt concentrations. Finally we find that at least two different active sites capable of processing of AP site DNA are located within the HhH domains. Taken together, our results provide the first structural model for Topo V and provide important insights into the nature of its interaction with DNA. The results also provide further evidence that Topo V and eukaryotic topoisomerase I enzymes belong to different type IB families (5Belova G.I. Prasad R. Kozyavkin S.A. Lake J.A. Wilson S.H. Slesarev A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All plasmids were constructed by common subcloning techniques and propagated in DH5α (Invitrogen) strain of E. coli. The expression plasmid pET21TV encoding the full-size Topo V was previously described (5Belova G.I. Prasad R. Kozyavkin S.A. Lake J.A. Wilson S.H. Slesarev A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify segments of the top5 gene from position 1 to 2055 (pET1478), from 1 to 1596 (pET14T61), and from 2056 to 2952 (pET14T34). The 5′ ends of the amplification products contained the NcoI restriction site followed by an initiating methionine codon for residue Met1. The 3′ ends contained stop codons immediately adjacent to the codon for residue Lys685 in case of pET14T78, residue Asp532 in case of pET14T61, and natural Topo V COOH terminus with the stop codon in case of pET14T34, followed by NdeI restriction site in all constructs. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with NcoI-NdeI and cloned into the plasmid pET14b (Novagen). The resulting plasmids, called pET14T78, pET14T61, and pET14T34 carried the coding sequences for a (i) 78-kDa COOH-truncated form of Topo V called Topo78 that starts at the natural Topo V NH2 terminus and ends at Lys685, (ii) a 61-kDa COOH-truncated form of Topo V called Topo61 that starts at the natural Topo V NH2 terminus and ends at Asp532, and (iii) a 34-kDa NH2-truncated form of Topo V called Topo34 that starts at a methionine immediately 5′ of Gly687 and ends at the natural Topo V COOH terminus. All subcloned sequences that had been subjected to polymerase chain reaction were sequenced to confirm proper construction of the initiation signal and to ensure that no other mutations were introduced. Proteins were overexpressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) and purified essentially as described earlier (2Slesarev A.I. Lake J.A. Stetter K.O. Gellert M. Kozyavkin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3295-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard topoisomerase activity assay was performed by incubating Topo78 or Topo61 with 0.2 μg of supercoiled pBluescript II SK DNA (Stratagene) in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 (at 75 °C), 5 mmEDTA, and 0.1 m potassium glutamate for Topo78 or 0.03m potassium glutamate for Topo61. The incubation was at 75 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by cooling and addition of SDS to 1%. Products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis at 1 V/cm for 16 h. One unit of topoisomerase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to relax 50% of form I pBluescript II SK DNA (0.2 μg) in the standard assay reaction. One unit of activity for Topo78 equals 0.012 μg, for Topo61 it equals 1.5 μg. Topo34 was incubated with 0.3 μg of supercoiled orEcoRV-linearized pBluescript DNA or with 0.2 μg of M13mp9 ssDNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.9 (at 80 °C), 1 m potassium glutamate, 5 mm EDTA, at 80 °C for 10 min. Products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis with 0.1 m potassium glutamate at 1 V/cm for 16 h. Positively supercoiled and relaxed DNA substrates were prepared by incubation with M. kandleri reverse gyrase or Topo V, respectively (Fidelity Systems). Sequencing grade endoproteinase Glu-C and trypsin were purchased from Promega, thermolysin was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All experimental digestions were carried out in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl and terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and SDS to final concentrations of 1 mm and 1%, respectively. 1 mm CaCl2 was added to reactions with trypsin. To assess the effect of DNA on the activity of proteases, bovine serum albumin (BioLabs) was subjected to digestion by endoproteinase Glu-C, trypsin, and thermolysin in the presence or absence of 75 μg/ml of plasmid DNA. The proteolytic fragments of Topo V were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The NH2-terminal sequencing was performed essentially as described earlier (5Belova G.I. Prasad R. Kozyavkin S.A. Lake J.A. Wilson S.H.

AP lyase and dRP lyase assays were performed essentially as described (19Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

The standard assay of an AP lyase activity consisted in an incubation of 0.08 μg of Topo78 or 0.04 μg of Topo34 with 20 nm32P-labeled (3′) duplex DNA substrate containing an AP site at position 21 (top strand, 5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAAUTAAGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCT-3′), in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.03m NaCl. The assay was performed at 60 °C for 5 min. The reaction products were stabilized by addition of NaBH4 (340 mm) and then separated by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide gel (7 m urea, 90 mm Tris/64 mm boric acid/2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. The dRP lyase activity was assayed under similar reaction conditions as for AP lyase, except that the uracil-DNA glycosylase-reacted DNA substrate was further treated with AP endonuclease in the presence of 5 mmMgCl2 to generate an incised AP-DNA. Trapping of covalent complexes of Topo78 and Topo61 with DNA by NaBH4 was performed as described previously (1Slesarev A.I. Stetter K.O. Lake J.A. Gellert M. Krah R. Kozyavkin S.A.

To examine the domain structure of Topo V, we subjected the recombinant full-length Topo V protein to limited proteolytic digestion with a variety of proteases. Endoproteinase Glu-C, trypsin and thermolysin were found to produce the most informative digestion patterns (Fig. 1). Endoproteinase Glu-C cleaves preferentially at a single site yielding two polypeptides of ∼61 and ∼51 kDa (Fig. 1 A). The sum of the apparent molecular masses of these fragments is equivalent to that of the calculated molecular mass of the full-length protein. NH2-terminal sequencing of these cleavage products by automated Edman chemistry revealed that the 61-kDa polypeptide originates from the amino terminus and the 51-kDa fragment arises via cleavage between amino acids Glu533 and Leu534(Table I).Table INH2-terminal sequences of Topo V fragmentsProteasePolypeptide kDaNH2-terminal sequenceDigestion temperature°CEndoproteinase611 ALVYDAEFV37 Glu-C51534 LKRKYGSASA37Trypsin781 ALVYDAEFVG3734686 SGRQERSEE37621 ALVYDAEF3716538 YGSASAVR37Thermolysin601 ALVYDAEFV8052524 IVGDLEKAD80441 ALVYDAEFVG80601 ALVYDAEF3752524 IVGDLEKAD3745582 AELYER3741624 LLNIEG3734686 SGRQER37Amino terminal sequence of full-size Topo V is highlighted in bold. Open table in a new tab Amino terminal sequence of full-size Topo V is highlighted in bold. Trypsin produces a different digestion pattern. It cleaves Topo V initially between Lys685 and Ser686 to yield a large amino-terminal polypeptide of ∼78 kDa and a smaller carboxyl fragment of about 34 kDa (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). At increased levels of trypsin the 78-kDa fragment is further converted to the amino-terminal ∼62 kDa and carboxyl-terminal ∼16 kDa polypeptides via cleavage between Lys537 and Tyr538 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4,5) as determined by N-terminal protein microsequencing. Limited proteolysis of Topo V with thermolysin was performed at 37 and 80 °C. The rationale of choosing proteolysis at 80 °C was that this temperature is close to the optimal temperature of Topo V activities (1Slesarev A.I. Stetter K.O. Lake J.A. Gellert M. Krah R. Kozyavkin S.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 2Slesarev A.I. Lake J.A. Stetter K.O. Gellert M. Kozyavkin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3295-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as compared with 37 °C (Fig. 1 C). Results shown in Fig. 1 C indicate that at low concentrations of thermolysin the initial cleavage pattern remains relatively unaffected at different incubation temperatures (Fig. 1 C,lanes 2, 3, and 6). In this case thermolysin cleaves Topo V between Ser523 and Ile524 to yield an NH2-terminal polypeptide of ∼60 kDa and a COOH-terminal fragment of ∼52 kDa. At 80 °C the amino-terminal 60-kDa fragment gets further digested to the NH2-terminal ∼44-kDa with a probable carboxyl terminus at Ile380, given the size of produced fragment and the specificity of thermolysin, while the COOH-terminal 52-kDa is cleaved into the number of low molecular weight peptides (Fig. 1 C,lanes 4, 5). At 37 °C the 60-kDa polypeptide remains largely resistant to thermolysin digestion, and the NH2-terminal 44-kDa was not detected at all. The 52-kDa carboxyl fragment is degraded stepwise to the ∼45-kDa, 41-kDa, and 34-kDa fragments from Ala582, Leu624, respectively, and, eventually, to the ∼34-kDa polypeptide, which is resistant to further digestion and starts at residue Ser686(Fig. 1 C, lanes 7–9). Thus, the thermolysin sensitivity of the 60-kDa NH2-terminal domain at high temperature suggests a significant conformational change, which in turn may activate Topo V activity. It is worthy to note that Topo V shows no appreciable topoisomerase activity below 60 °C (1Slesarev A.I. Stetter K.O. Lake J.A. Gellert M. Krah R. Kozyavkin S.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The revealed domain boundaries parallel those predicted from the sequence analysis of Topo V and from sequence comparisons with other type IB topoisomerases and the integrase family of tyrosine recombinases (5Belova G.I. Prasad R. Kozyavkin S.A. Lake J.A. Wilson S.H. Slesarev A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Namely, the core topoisomerase domain, which is composed of ∼300 NH2-terminal amino acids and contained the active site tyrosine (Tyr226), appears to be a tightly packed globular subdomain and is highly resistant to proteolysis under all conditions tested. In contrast, the rest of the Topo V sequence is apparently organized into more flexible subdomain structures, which can undergo rearrangements at high temperatures. With the above structural information in mind, we next sought to gain insight into the domain(s) of Topo V that either interact with DNA or undergo a conformational change upon binding to DNA. To this end, we compared the proteolytic digestion pattern of recombinant Topo V in the presence and absence of plasmid DNA. After performing preliminary experiments to ensure that DNA does not act as general inhibitor of thermolysin (see “Experimental Procedures”), we subjected full-length Topo V to digestion with increasing quantities of protease in the presence or absence of plasmid DNA. (Fig. 1, A andB, lanes 6–9, C and D, lanes 6–9). The DNA:protein mass ratio (2:1) was used to ensure that DNA-protein complexes remained soluble (data not shown). At 37 °C the cleavage pattern remains essentially the same with and without DNA for all proteases. A remarkably different picture was observed with thermolysin when the proteolytic pattern was compared with and without DNA at 80 °C (Fig. 1, C and D, comparelanes 1–5) Thus, the specificity of interaction of the 52-kDa domain of Topo V to DNA at 80 °C increases greatly. It also implies that a conformational change may occur in this domain at high temperature upon DNA binding. Based on limited proteolysis results we concluded that Topo V is organized into four subdomains. The ∼380 NH2-terminal amino acids form the 44-kDa core topoisomerase subdomain (residues Met1-Ile380), which contains ∼4 HhH motifs. This subdomain is highly resistant to proteolysis. The remaining ∼580 COOH-terminal amino acids residues are organized into HhH motifs-containing domain, which can be divided into three subdomains: subdomain I (residues Leu381-Ser523), subdomain II (residues Ile524-Lys685), and subdomain III (residues Ser686-Gly984), defined by accessibility to endoproteinase Glu-C, trypsin, or thermolysin (Fig.2 A). The 16-kDa subdomain I and the 34-kDa subdomain III are relatively resistant to digestion, while the 18-kDa region is sensitive to proteolysis and can serve as a hinge between two other subdomains. First to investigate the biochemical activities residing in these various subdomains of Topo V, we constructed three expression plasmids that encode the following sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”). The recombinant 78-kDa and 61-kDa polypeptides consists of the 44-, 16-, and 18-kDa, and 44- and 16-kDa subdomain, respectively (Fig. 2), whereas, Topo34 subdomain contains the COOH-terminal residues of the Topo V without the first 685 NH2-terminal amino acids (Fig. 2). The recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 2 B). We found that both Topo78 and Topo61 possess the topoisomerase activity, while Topo34 does not. To evaluate the temperature dependence of the Topo78 and Topo61 on relaxation activity we incubated these polypeptides in the standard topoisomerase assay buffer at different temperatures with negatively supercoiled pBluescript DNA (Fig. 3,A and B). All these enzymes show almost no relaxation activity below 60 °C. The same low temperature barrier was originally observed for full-size Topo V (1Slesarev A.I. Stetter K.O. Lake J.A. Gellert M. Krah R. Kozyavkin S.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Both Topo78 and Topo61 produce fully relaxed duplex DNA at 70–75 °C, whereas at higher temperature (above 80 °C) both enzymes generate highly unwound forms of DNA (Fig. 3). This effect, named unlinking (i.e. the substantial reduction in DNA linking number), is caused by DNA melting, and had been described in detail earlier (2Slesarev A.I. Lake J.A. Stetter K.O. Gellert M. Kozyavkin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3295-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Slesarev A.I. Zaitzev D.A. Kopylov V.M. Stetter K.O. Kozyavkin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12321-12328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is difficult to follow the unlinking reaction on the supercoiled substrate because the products migrate close to, or with, the substrate on the gel. To overcome this problem a simpler assay was designed, in which a relaxed DNA substrate is used to allow the detection of Topo78 and Topo61 unlinking activities easily. The results of this assay are shown in Fig. 3. Topo78 unlinks DNA at 95 °C in the range 2–25 mm NaCl (Fig. 3 C), whereas 50 mmNaCl appears to be inhibitory for the Topo78 unlinking activity (Fig.3 C). This is in sharp contrast to full-length Topo V, which can unlink DNA in 200 mm NaCl (2Slesarev A.I. Lake J.A. Stetter K.O. Gellert M. Kozyavkin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3295-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results shown in Fig.3 D compare the unlinking activities of Topo78 and Topo61 at 95 °C in the presence of 5 mm NaCl and 5 mmNa2EDTA (I), 5 mm MgCl2 (II) or 5 mm CaCl2 (III). The unlinking activity of Topo78 is almost the same in 25 mm NaCl or in 5 mm NaCl with 5 mm MgCl2 or CaCl2 suggesting that the Topo 78 activity was similar to the full-length Topo V activity (2Slesarev A.I. Lake J.A. Stetter K.O. Gellert M. Kozyavkin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3295-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the unlinking activity depends on the actual ionic strength of the buffer rather than on specific ions. Topo61 on the other hand, while showing a similar ionic dependence, has much lower specific activity (∼100 times lower) than Topo78. Interestingly, duplex DNA disappears when Topo61 is used at the highest concentration (0.7 unit) in the presence of CaCl2(Fig. 3 D, lane 13). This could be due to the intensive nicking of duplex DNA, which then melts and appears as single-stranded species at the bottom of the gel. Further experiments are required to elucidate this effect. Since both Topo78 and Topo61 require much lower salt concentrations for unlinking activity than full-length Topo V, we chose to investigate their salt dependence in detail. Both enzymes relax supercoiled DNA in a range of 10 to 100 mm NaCl/KCl concentrations with an optimum around 30 mm (Fig.4, A, B, andF and Table II). The highest activity was at ∼35 mm for both salts. The replacement of the Cl− anion by Glu− widens the range of Na+ and K+ concentrations for enzyme activities up to 250 mm for Topo78 (Fig. 4,C and D) and 150 mm for Topo61 (Fig.4 E). In K-Glu and Na-Glu Topo78 acts somewhat processively, as demonstrated by the appearance of fully relaxed topoisomers before the disappearance of supercoiled substrate (Fig. 4, C andD).Table IIEffect of different ions on the DNA relaxation activity of Topo V, Topo78, and Topo61Concentration at which the activity is maximalHighest concentration at which the activity was detectedK-GluKClNaClK-GluKClNaClm2-am, molar concentration.m2-am, molar concentration.Topo V, 80C, EDTA1.500.450.302.100.550.45Topo78, 75C, EDTA0.070.0350.030.200.100.10Topo61, 75C, EDTA0.030.030.030.150.050.052-a m, molar concentration. Open table in a new tab We had previously established that MgCl2 had no effect on the relaxation activity of Topo V at the optimal monovalent salt concentrations (see Table II). This was not the case for Topo78 and Topo61. Initially, we found that the highest effect of Mg2+and Ca2+ on their relaxing activities was at 5 mm over a range of NaCl or KCl (data not shown). In the next experiment using different concentrations of Topo78 or Topo61 we compared the relaxation activity of enzymes in 30 mm NaCl (NaCl optimum) and in the presence of 5 mmMgCl2 or 5 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 4,G and H). These experiments reveal that divalent metal cations stimulate Topo78 and Topo61 by ∼2- and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 4, G and H). The difference in the effect of divalent ions on Topo V on the one side and on Topo78 and Topo61 on the other can be explained by the fact that Topo V requires higher monovalent salt concentration for the optimal activity as compared with these polypeptides (Table II). Essentially similar results as described above were obtained in experiments with positively supercoiled plasmid DNA (data not shown). From comparisons of Topo78 and Topo61 with full-length Topo V two major conclusions can be drawn. First, the specific topoisomerase activity of Topo78 and Topo61 is 10-, and 1000-fold less than that of Topo V, respectively. Second, the optimal and maximal salt concentrations for Topo78 and Topo61 are about 10 times lower than those of Topo V. Taking into account that Topo78 and Topo61 were obtained by progressive trimming the COOH terminus, which contains a number of HhH motifs, we speculated that the HhH motifs play a crucial role in Topo V interactions with DNA at high salt concentrations. These motifs may form a protein structure that anchors the enzyme on DNA in high salt. Furthermore, these motifs render high processivity to Topo V in the very broad range of salt concentrations. Topo78 has a very weak processivity as compared with full-length Topo V, whereas Topo61 was completely lacking processivity. The COOH terminus domain (Topo34) spans amino acids 687–984 and consists exclusively of HhH motifs (5Belova G.I. Prasad R. Kozyavkin S.A. Lake J.A. Wilson S.H. Slesarev A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There is no topoisomerase activity associated with Topo34. This is not surprising, as the only active site tyrosine of Topo V is located in its NH2-terminal part and is absent in Topo34. To investigate DNA-binding properties of Topo34 we incubated different amounts of Topo34 at 80 °C in 1 m K-Glu with different forms of DNA: negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA, linear duplex DNA, and ssDNA (Fig. 5). Protein-DNA complexes were then analyzed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (23Musgrave D. Forterre P. Slesarev A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At the protein:DNA mass ratio 1:3 to 2:1 (Fig. 5, A andB) Topo34 interacts with both supercoiled and linear DNA. It is interesting to note that the protein more readily binds an open circular DNA form, which is topologically equivalent to linear DNA, than supercoiled DNA (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3–6). Another interesting fact is that Topo34 enhances the electrophoretic mobility of DNA, rather than retards it, which is indicative of DNA compaction by the protein. In other words, its way of interaction with duplex DNA superficially resembles that of archaeal histones (23Musgrave D. Forterre P. Slesarev A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Sandman K. Krzycki J.A. Dobrinski B. Lurz R. Reeve J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5788-5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) rather than transcription factors. The latter retards DNA in gel-shift assays. Fig. 5 C shows the results of the Topo34 interaction with single stranded DNA. There is no change in the mobility of ssDNA at protein:DNA ratios from 1:10 to 1:1 (data not shown). A slight retardation of DNA occurs at the protein:DNA ratio of 1.6:1 and higher (Fig. 5 C, lanes 2–4). In all protein:DNA ratios used complexes are retarded in a gel, i.e. apparently no DNA compaction occurs. Compared with duplex DNA, about 5× more Topo34 is required to achieve a noticeable retardation in the mobility of ssDNA upon binding with Topo34. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays of Topo34 parallel our earlier finding that Topo V is not inhibited by ssDNA in the presence of 1 m K-Glu or in 0.3 m NaCl and 2.2 m betaine (3Kozyavkin S.A.

We have demonstrated earlier that Topo V possesses two AP site-processing activities that are important in base excision DNA repair (25Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Topo V can incise the phosphodiester backbone of the AP site, and also from the AP endonuclease-cleaved AP site it can remove the 5′-2-deoxyribose 5-phosphate moiety so that the one-nucleotide gap with a 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphate is generated, which can be filled by a DNA polymerase (5Belova G.I.

The Tyr226 → Phe mutant of Topo V, which is not able to relax supercoiled DNA or to make a covalent phosphotyrosine bond with DNA, has, however, the same level of AP and dRP lyase activities as intact Topo V. Moreover, we have shown that Topo61 failed to repair activities or to make the NaBH4-mediated covalent complex with dRP site-containing DNA (5Belova G.I. Prasad R. Kozyavkin S.A. Lake J.A.

We performed several experiments to determine whether or not Topo78 and Topo34 possess DNA repair activities. The results demonstrates that both proteins possess AP lyase (Fig.6 A) and dRP lyase (Fig.6 B) activities. Similar to DNA polymerase β (20Matsumoto Y. Kim K.

We determined this activity by trapping the proteins with preincised AP DNA by using NaBH4 as the Schiff base-reducing reagent. Topo78-DNA and Topo34-DNA complexes were detected and identified by autoradiography (Fig. 6 C). This result implies that the chemical mechanism of the Topo78 and Topo34 dRP lyase reaction proceeds through an imine-DNA intermediate and that the active-site residue responsible for dRP release must contain a primary amine. The Tyr226 → Phe mutant of Topo78, which has no topoisomerase activity, traps the NaBH4-mediated covalent complex with dRP site-containing DNA and has the same level of AP and dRP lyase activities as intact Topo V (Fig. 6, A–C). Thus, these experiments further suggest that the topoisomerase and DNA repair activities of Topo V reside in different parts of the protein and the DNA repair activity is dispensable for the topoisomerase catalytic activity. Finally, these experiments established that Topo V has at least two different active centers capable of processing AP site DNA.

https://openalex.org/W1966032484,"Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a multifunctional transcription factor that activates, represses, or initiates transcription of a diverse assortment of genes. Previous studies suggest a role for YY1 in cellular growth and differentiation, but its biological function during development of the vertebrate oocyte or embryo remains to be determined. We recently showed that YY1 is abundantly expressed throughout oogenesis and early embryonic stages ofXenopus, but it is sequestered in the cytoplasm and does not function directly in transcriptional regulation. In the present study we used a series of biochemical analyses to explore the potential function of YY1 in the oocyte cytoplasm. YY1 was isolated from oocyte lysates by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography, suggesting that it associates with maternally expressed mRNA in vivo. RNA mobility shift assays demonstrate that endogenous YY1 binds to labeled histone mRNA. Size exclusion chromatography of oocyte lysates revealed that YY1 exists in high molecular mass complexes in the range of 480 kDa. Destruction of endogenous RNA by RNase treatment of lysates, abolished the binding of YY1 to oligo(dT)-cellulose and resulted in redistribution from 480-kDa complexes to the monomeric form. Microinjection of RNase directly into the cytoplasm released YY1 from 480-kDa complexes and unmasked its DNA-binding activity, but did not promote translocation to the nucleus. These results provide evidence that YY1 is a component of ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes in the Xenopus oocyte, indicating a novel function for YY1 in the storage or metabolism of maternal transcripts.

Yin Yang 1 messenger ribonucleoprotein size exclusion chromatography proliferating cell nuclear antigen CCAAT box transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1)1 is a highly conserved GLI-Kruppel transcription factor that functions as a repressor, activator, or initiator of transcription of a large number of cellular and viral genes (reviewed in Refs. 1Galvin K.M.

The multiple functions of YY1 are influenced by the promoter context of its binding site(s), the cellular environment, and by virtue of its interactions with other proteins. Indeed, numerous protein interactions have been identified, and there is evidence to suggest that these facilitate various adaptations of YY1 activity in a diversity of contexts.

YY1 also exerts its transcriptional effects by modification of chromatin structure through interactions with histone deacetylases (10Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) or histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP (11Lee J.S. See R.H. Galvin K.M. Wang J. Shi Y.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5979-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Other interacting proteins, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1), are also known to modify YY1 directly (13Oei S.L.

Commun. 2001; 284: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Clearly, YY1 is subject to very complex regulation, and not surprisingly, the mechanisms underlying coordination and specification of its repressor or activator functions in various contexts remain to be elucidated. Recognition sites for YY1 have been identified in the promoters of a large number of genes that are expressed in a variety of tissues including muscle, blood, testes, and bone (1Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Evidence from numerous tissue culture studies have suggested YY1 controls expression of developmentally regulated genes, and therefore it has been hypothesized to play an essential role in cell growth, development, and differentiation. However there have been few direct examinations of YY1 in vertebrate developmental model systems, and its biological role in embryonic development remains poorly understood. In mouse YY1 is abundantly expressed in oocytes and early embryos, displays a dynamic pattern of subcellular localization in early development, and is selectively expressed in certain tissues later in development (15Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Heterozygous mutation in the mouse resulted in growth and neurulation defects, and full knockout caused embryonic lethality around implantation, suggesting YY1 functions at multiple stages of mouse development (15Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We recently showed that YY1 is an abundantly expressed maternally derived protein synthesized in early oocytes and stable throughout subsequent embryonic development of Xenopus (16Ficzycz A. Eskiw C. Meyer D. Marley K.E. Hurt M. Ovsenek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22819-22825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Its DNA-binding activity is high during early oogenesis then is repressed until after the mid-blastula stage, raising the intriguing possibility that it could function to activate or repress a battery of target genes at specific points in development. However, we found that YY1 is sequestered in the cytoplasm in oocytes and in cells of the early embryo, and expression analyses showed it does not play a direct role in oocyte or embryonic transcription (16Ficzycz A. Eskiw C. Meyer D. Marley K.E. Hurt M. Ovsenek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22819-22825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that cytoplasmic retention may provide a means to inhibit or delay gene regulatory activity of YY1 until later in development, but it was also possible that YY1 could carry out an essential, as yet unidentified, function(s) in the cytoplasm. Also, it has been shown that overexpression of YY1 in embryos induces an ectopic neural axis, but the underlying mechanism remains to be determined (6Satijn D.P. Hamer K.M. den Blaauwen J. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In this study we employed biochemical methods to explore the biological activity of YY1 in the oocyte cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is packed with vast amounts of maternal mRNAs, most of which are stored in ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles that protect mRNA from degradation and prevent premature translation (reviewed in Ref. 17Davidson E.H. Gene Activity in Early Development.3rd Ed. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986Google Scholar). The results shown here establish that YY1 associates with maternal mRNA in high molecular weight mRNP complexes. Destruction of maternal RNA abolishes binding of YY1 to oligo(dT), disrupts the integrity of mRNP complexes, and unmasks its DNA-binding activity. The data provide evidence of a novel function for YY1 in the oocyte as a component of cytoplasmic mRNP particles. The dual role as a DNA-binding transcription factor and mRNP suggests similarity to a class of molecules that regulate both transcription and translation during development, including CCAAT box transcription factor (CBTF) (18Brzostowski J.

Portions ofXenopus laevis ovaries were obtained surgically from adult female frogs (Xenopus I, Ann Arbour MI.) and follicle cells were removed by gentle agitation in Ca2+-free OR2 (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm Hepes, 10 mg/liter streptomycin sulfate, 10 mg/liter benzyl penicillin) containing 0.2% type II collagenase (Sigma) for 4 h. Stage VI oocytes were selected, washed extensively in OR2 and maintained at 18 °C. For in vivo RNase experiments, oocytes were microinjected with 200 ng of RNase A (Sigma) in a volume of 20 nl and incubated at for 8 h at 18 °C. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by manual dissection as described previously (20Bharadwaj S. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8033-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For RNA and DNA-mobility shift assays, lysates were prepared by homogenization of oocytes in buffer C (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μl/ml leupeptin) as previously described (16Ficzycz A.

Lysates for oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography were prepared essentially as described previously (21Marello K. LaRovere J. Sommerville J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5593-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Oocytes were homogenized at 4 °C in 4 volumes of buffer (8% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 units/ml RNAGuard (Promega)). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 12 min at 2 °C, and supernatants were centrifuged a second time to remove residual cell debris. Yolk proteins were removed by extraction with an equal volume of 1,1,2-trichlorofluoroethane, and supernatants were adjusted to 100 mm NaCl. For size exclusion chromatography (SEC), lysates were prepared by homogenization in buffer C containing 100 units/ml RNAGuard (Promega). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were filtered through 0.2 μm nylon membranes (Gelman Laboratory) and stored at −80 °C. HepG2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed, and lysates were prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mmKCl, 20% v/v glycerol, 100 μm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μl/ml leupeptin). Homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 4,000 × g, and the supernatants were filtered through 0.2-μm nylon membranes (Gelman Laboratory), and stored at −80 °C. Oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography was carried out using previously described protocols (22Matsumoto K. Aoki K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Lysates (300 μl) were applied to 100 μl of oligo(dT)-cellulose (New England Biolabs) pre-equilibrated with 10 volumes of binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and incubated 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Matrix was washed in 6 volumes of binding buffer, and bound material was eluted in 400 μl of binding buffer containing 25% (v/v) formamide. Columns were run using a Biologic HR (Bio-Rad) high pressure chromatography control unit at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Lysates (300 μl) were applied to 1-ml columns, and the flow-through was re-applied to columns four times. Poly(A)+ bound proteins were eluted in 200-μl fractions with binding buffer containing a range of NaCl from 100 mmto 2 m. Proteins were precipitated in 5 volumes of acetone at −80 °C. Lysates (300 μl) were loaded onto size exclusion columns using either Bio-Sil SEC 250–5 (Bio-Rad; separation range 10–300 kDa) or Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences; separation range, 10–11,000 kDa) using a Bio-Logic HR HPLC (Bio-Rad) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with column buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA). Fractions (200 μl) were collected and precipitated in 5 volumes of acetone at −80 °C. Samples were resuspended in 60 μl of Laemmli buffer. Columns were calibrated using Gel Filtration Standard Bio-Rad catalog number 151–1901) containing the following markers: thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), vitamin B-12 (1.35 kDa). Proteins were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and immunoblotting was performed as previously described (20Bharadwaj S. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8033-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for immunoblotting were: rabbit anti-human YY1 polyclonal (SC-281, Santa Cruz), anti-human PCNA monoclonal (SC-56, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Xenopusnucleolin (23Heine M.A. Rankin M.L. DiMario P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1189-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (gift of Dr. Patrick DeMario Louisiana State University), rabbit anti-Xenopus FRGY2 (24Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. New Biol. 1992; 4: 349-359PubMed Google Scholar) (gift of Dr. K. Matsumoto, Riken, Wako, Saitama, Japan). Antibody-protein interactions were detected by chemiluminescence (Renaissance System; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposure to x-ray film. Binding reactions and DNA gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (16Ficzycz A. Eskiw C. Meyer D. Marley K.E. Hurt M. Ovsenek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22819-22825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). RNA gel mobility shift assays were performed essentially using the methods as described previously (25Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28297-28303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Binding reactions were carried out for 20 min at 4 °C in RNA binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), 4 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 30% v/v glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) with 0.5 ng of labeled RNA probe and 20 μg of soluble protein in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. Antibodies against YY1 and PCNA (see above) were added directly into reactions in a range of concentrations (25–400 ng). Samples were immediately loaded onto non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 6.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 5% glycerol. Gels were maintained at 4 °C during electrophoresis for 2.5 h at 160 volts. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film overnight at −80 °C. The mRNA probe encoding Xenopus histone H2A was synthesized from a plasmid (pBluescript) containing a 393-nucleotide H2A PCR product inserted into the SmaI site. Plasmid was linearized at the BamHI site at the 3′-end of the insert (a gift of Dr. A. Johnson, Florida State Univ., Tallahassee, FL), and 32P-labeled RNA was synthesized in vitro with modifications to the method as previously described (26Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 397-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Previous domain analysis of YY1 shows that it contains four C2H2 zinc finger domains that function in DNA binding (1Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 2Thomas M.J. Seto E. Gene. 1999; 236: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This structure of the YY1 molecule provided an important first clue to its potential role in the cytoplasm. Certain RNA-binding proteins, including, TFIIIA which is known to bind oocyte 5S RNA (27Brown R.S. Ferguson C. Kingswell A. Winkler F.K. Leonard K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3802-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), display sequence similarity to zinc finger DNA-binding transcription factors, particularly in the spacing of cysteine and histidine residues (28Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). We searched for known RNA-binding motifs (28Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) in the amino acid sequence of Xenopus YY1 (29Pisaneschi G. Ceccotti S. Falchetti M.L. Fiumicino S. Carnevali F. Beccari E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The protein sequence alignment with TFIIIA presented in Fig.1 shows the presence of a generalized zinc finger/knuckle between residues 255 and 287 of YY1. Significant similarities to other known RNA binding motifs were not found (data not shown). The appropriate spacing of key residues of the RNA-binding knuckle suggested to us that YY1 might bind RNA in the oocyte cytoplasm and might therefore be a component of mRNP complexes. Previous studies have exploited the ability of native mRNP particles containing maternal mRNA to bind selectively to oligo(dT) through the 3′-poly(A) tail (21Marello K. LaRovere J. Sommerville J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5593-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Matsumoto K. Aoki K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Cummings A. Sommerville J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To test for a potential RNA-binding function of YY1, we analyzed oocyte lysates by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. Lysates were mixed with oligo(dT)-cellulose, and after extensive washing of the cellulose matrix, the bound material was eluted in a buffer containing 25% formamide. The eluants were then analyzed for the presence of proteins by Coomassie staining and Western blotting. A small subset of proteins were retained on the oligo(dT) matrix (Fig.2 A), similar to what has been previously reported (22Matsumoto K. Aoki K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsujimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar),. Western blots show that YY1 was among the proteins present in the bound fraction, as was nucleolin, a known component of oocyte mRNPs (31Yurkova M.S. Murray M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10870-10876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)(Fig. 2 B). In control experiments, other proteins such as nuclear PCNA, a nuclear marker protein in Xenopus oocytes, did not bind to oligo(dT) and were not isolated by this procedure (Fig. 2 B). We also applied oocyte lysates to oligo(dT)-cellulose columns, washed extensively, and eluted bound proteins using a salt gradient. YY1 eluted from the column at 600–750 mm NaCl (Fig.2 C). The binding of YY1 to oligo(dT)-cellulose indicates that YY1 binds to maternal poly(A)+ mRNA in the oocyte cytoplasm. To rule out the possibility that YY1 has high affinity for oligo(dT), lysates were treated with RNase prior to chromatography. Destruction of RNA abolished the retention of YY1 (Fig. 2 C), demonstrating that its affinity for oligo(dT) was dependent on its interaction with intact RNA in oocyte lysates. These results provide initial evidence that YY1 associates with maternal mRNA in the cytoplasm, which strongly suggests that it is a component of cytoplasmic mRNPs. We next used in vitro RNA mobility shift assays to test more directly for the ability of YY1 to associate with RNA. Oocyte lysates were incubated with a 393-nucleotide radiolabeled histone mRNA probe, and samples were electrophoresed on non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 5% glycerol. The rationale for the use of histone mRNA as a probe in these experiments was that it is a small message amenable to the mobility shift assay and it is an abundant mRNA species in the oocyte (32Woodland H.R. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) providing a biologically relevant binding target. Also, previous studies have used histone mRNA probes to demonstrate in vitro binding activity of mRNPs (19Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 318-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). At least two prominent protein-mRNA complexes were detected as retarded bands (Fig. 3). Formation of the more slowly migrating complex was disrupted in a concentration-dependent manner by addition of YY1-antibodies directly into the binding reactions (Fig.3 A). In controls, neither complex was affected by addition of antibodies against PCNA (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that disruption of the upper band was due to specific YY1-antibody recognition of a YY1-containing mRNA-complex. This data confirms that native YY1 in oocyte lysates is capable of associating with mRNA, but whether YY1 binds directly or as part of a larger multi-protein complex, or if there is sequence-specificity, remains to be determined. The specific retention of YY1 on oligo(dT)-cellulose (Fig. 2) and its presence in protein-mRNA complexes (Fig. 3) provided initial evidence that YY1 in its native state associates with or is a component of mRNPs in the oocyte cytoplasm. To confirm this, we fractionated oocyte lysates by SEC in order to examine the size distribution of native YY1. In the initial experiments, lysates were applied to BIO-SILECT 250 (Bio-Rad) columns, fractions were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. All of the YY1 was detected in the column flow-through (Fig.4). Its presence in the void material suggested that in its native state YY1 exists in complexes larger than 300 kDa in the cytoplasm. To more accurately determine the size of YY1 complexes, we next applied lysates to SEC using Superdex 200, a matrix with the capacity to separate larger protein complexes. YY1 was detected in fractions around 480 kDa (Fig.5). Monomers were not detected in untreated native lysates using either matrix, suggesting that the majority of endogenous YY1 is bound in large complexes.

This resulted in a complete redistribution of YY1 to fractions around 60 kDa, close to its predicted molecular size as a monomer (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, targeted destruction of RNA in vitro destabilized 480-kDa YY1 complexes present in oocyte lysates and resulted in the release of monomers. This demonstrates that the integrity of native complexes is dependent on the presence of intact maternal mRNA. In control experiments, we treated aliquots of the same lysates with DNase prior to SEC, which did not significantly alter the size distribution of YY1 (Fig. 5). Therefore, RNase-mediated destabilization of 480-kDa YY1 complexes was likely a direct result of RNA destruction rather than an artifact of the experimental protocol. The effects of RNase seen in these experiments provide strong evidence that YY1 associates with mRNP particles in the cytoplasm of oocytes. The isolation of YY1 in large RNase-sensitive complexes is entirely consistent with its binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose (Fig. 2) and mRNA-binding activity (Fig. 3). YY1 is clearly a component of mRNP particles in the Xenopus oocyte. We also carried out a direct comparison between the relative size distribution of cytoplasmic and nuclear YY1 by SEC. HepG2 cell lysates were used as a source of nuclear YY1 since we have shown that it is entirely a nuclear protein in adult liver cells (16Ficzycz A. Eskiw C. Meyer D. Marley K.E. Hurt M. Ovsenek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22819-22825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Most if not all of YY1 from liver cell lysates was detected in fractions around its predicted size as a monomer or dimer (Fig. 5). To analyze the association of YY1 with mRNPs in vivo, we tested the effects of degrading maternal mRNAin vivo after microinjection of a high concentration of RNase directly into the oocyte cytoplasm. Similar techniques have been used to examine the behavior of the CBTF in Xenopus embryos (18Brzostowski J. Robinson C. Orford R. Elgar S. Scarlett G. Peterkin T. Malartre M. Kneale G. Wormington M. Guille M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). First, we compared the relative size of YY1 in native and RNase-treated extracts by SEC. Microinjected RNase resulted in a redistribution of YY1 from high to low molecular weight fractions (Fig.6 A), confirming that association of YY1 in mRNP complexes is dependent on intact maternal mRNA. In a previous paper, we demonstrated that YY1 is localized to the cytoplasm through early development and displays high levels of DNA-binding activity in early (stage I-II) oocytes, which is masked through subsequent oogenesis and reactivated at the mid-blastula stage after 12 h of embryonic development (16Ficzycz A. Eskiw C. Meyer D. Marley K.E. Hurt M. Ovsenek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22819-22825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that the DNA-binding activity of YY1 may be physically blocked by virtue of direct mRNA-binding and/or association with mRNPs. Since SEC analysis shows targeted RNA degradation appears to release YY1 monomers from mRNP complexes (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6), we next tested whether this might also unmask its DNA-binding activity. Oocytes were microinjected with RNase, incubated for several hours, then manually dissected into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. These were then analyzed by gel mobility shift assays using a double-stranded DNA probe containing a consensus YY1 binding site. The YY1-DNA complex typically migrates at a position below a ubiquitous nonspecific DNA-binding activity attributable to protein(s) in the nucleus (16Ficzycz A. Eski"

There was no significant difference in eliciting Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis among the variants with the exception of LD78βT9A showing a substantially reduced activity.

However, there is a concern that the sustained long term suppression of the effects of chemokine-chemokine receptor interaction may produce significant adverse effects. In fact, hepatitis C virus-infected individuals with CCR5-Δ32 mutation have recently been reported to have significantly higher viremia levels of the hepatitis C virus than those with the normal form of CCR5 (1717. Woitas, R. P., Ahlenstiel, G., Brackmann, H. H., Matz, B., Rockstroh, J. K., and Spengler, U. (2001) The 8th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunisitc Infections, Chicago, February 4-8, 2001, p. 499 (abs).Google Scholar). Thus, the agents that block the cellular entry of HIV-1 through the inhibition of HIV-1 binding to chemokine receptors but do not block the chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions are thought to be more suitable as therapeutics for HIV infection.The natural CCR5 ligands MIP-1α (also named LD78α), MIP-1β, and RANTES bind to CCR5 receptors and can block R5 HIV-1 replication (18Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (2621) Google Scholar). The LD78 gene family consists of a variety of genes presumably evolved through duplications, deletions, and/or mutations (19Obaru K. Fukuda M. Maeda S. Shimada K. J. Biochem.

LD78β is reportedly more potent in cellular Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis induction and the activity against HIV-1 by ∼10-fold compared with LD78α (21Nibbs R.J. Yang J. Landau N.R. Mao J.H. Graham G.J. J.

It is thought that an interaction of the NH2 terminus of LD78 and the second extracellular loop of CCR5 is critical for the initiation of signal transduction (24Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar).In this study, in an attempt to elucidate which amino acid(s) plays a critical role in the interaction of LD78β and its receptor CCR5 and how the NH2 terminus of LD78β is associated with its inhibitory activity against HIV-1, we generated six LD78β variants with an amino acid substituted to Ala at the NH2 terminus of LD78β and questioned the structure-activity relationships. We found that there was no significant difference in Ca2+flux and chemotaxis induction among the variants examined with the exception of an LD78β variant whose Thr-9 was substituted with Ala (LD78βT9A) that showed a moderately reduced activity, whereas LD78βP2A and LD78βT9A had significantly reduced CCR5 down-regulation. We also found that LD78βD6A and LD78βP8A exerted the greatest anti-HIV-1 activity among the variants examined. The present data suggest that the modification of LD78β may produce more potent biologic agents against HIV-1 and that certain LD78β variants with an appropriate amino acid substitution(s) may serve as an effective chemokine-based therapeutic(s) against HIV-1 infection preserving the LD78β CCR5 interaction.DISCUSSIONIn this work, in an attempt to determine which amino acids in the NH2 terminus of LD78β are critical in its interaction with CCR5, we generated six LD78β variants with an amino acid substituted to Ala at the NH2 terminus of LD78β recombinant. We then found that the substitution of Pro-2, Asp-6, Pro-8, and Thr-9 caused significant changes in LD78β binding to CCR5 and inhibition of R5 HIV-1 replication. It is noteworthy that although all the LD78β variants with the exception of LD78βT9Ahad comparable activity to induce intracellular Ca2+ flux, their activity to inhibit R5 HIV-1 replication varied substantially. These data suggest that the competence of LD78β to induce signal transduction does not parallel with its competence to block the infectivity of R5 HIV-1. When we compared the order of HIV-1 replication inhibition, it was LD78βP8A > LD78βD6A > LD78βWT, LD78βL3A> LD78βT7A, LD78βP2A > LD78βT9A. When we further examined CCR5 binding affinity of LD78β variants exploiting heterologous displacement assays (Fig.6 A) using CCR5-Molt4 cells and 2D7 monoclonal antibody that binds to CCR5-ECL2A, the comparative order for 2D7 displacement was LD78βP8A, LD78βD6A > LD78βWT> LD78βL3A > LD78βT7A > LD78βP2A, LD78βT9A. These results were corroborated with the results of 125I-MIP-1α binding inhibition by LD78βWT and variants (Fig. 6 B). These data together suggested that LD78β binding to CCR5 regardless of affinity is sufficient for signal transduction, whereas the greater magnitude of the binding is required for the greater anti-HIV-1 activity. In respect to analyzing the activity to block HIV-1 replication of LD78α and LD78β, Nibbs et al. (21Nibbs R.J. Yang J. Landau N.R. Mao J.H. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17478-17483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) recently reported that the magnitude of the binding affinity and HIV-1 replication inhibition of the two LD78 molecules correlated with that of their potency of fluxing Ca2+. In this study (21Nibbs R.J. Yang J. Landau N.R. Mao J.H. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17478-17483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the second amino acid residue Pro at the NH2 terminus of LD78β had been substituted with Ser, thus designated as LD78α (also termed MIP-1αS), but their LD78α also had two additional amino acid substitutions at residues 39 and 47 compared with LD78β, which may have influenced their potency of signal transduction and HIV-1 replication inhibition. More recently, Townson et al. (40Townson J.R. Graham G.J. Landau N.R. Rasala B. Nibbs R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39254-39261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported that non-allelic isoform of aminooxypentane-linked MIP-1α, which is the same as LD78β linked to aminooxypentane at the NH2 terminus, had similar chemotaxis-inducing and Ca2+ flux-inducing activity compared with LD78β but possessed a much greater activity against HIV-1 replication. Simmons et al. (41Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Picard L. Offord R.E. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Buser R. Wells T.N. Proudfoot A.E. Science. 1997; 276: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) also reported that another CC chemokine, RANTES, with aminooxypentane added to its NH2 terminus (termed non-allelic isoform of aminooxypentane-linked MIP-1α-RANTES) acquired an increased anti-HIV-1 activity but had a substantially decreased chemotaxis-inducing activity compared with wild type RANTES. Taken together, the present data suggest that certain LD78β variants with an appropriate amino acid substitution such as LD78βD6Aand LD78βP8A may serve as an effective chemokine-based anti-HIV-1 therapeutic(s) while preserving LD78β-CCR5 interactions. It is also possible that substituting one or more amino acids to amino acids other than Ala in the NH2 terminus of LD78β produce more potent anti-HIV-1 biologic agents.It should be noted that there are several small molecule agents such as TAK-779 (15Baba M. Nishimura O. Kanzaki N. Okamoto M. Sawada H. Iizawa Y. Shiraishi M. Aramaki Y. Okonogi K. Ogawa Y. Meguro K. Fujino M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One can postulate that these agents bind to CCR5 and allosterically inhibit the binding of CC chemokines as well as glycoprotein120 of HIV-1 to CCR5. In the potential use of these agents as therapeutics for HIV-1 infection, there is a concern that the sustained long term suppression of the effects of chemokines-chemokine receptors interaction may produce significant adverse effects. In fact most recently, hepatitis C virus-infected individuals with CCR5-Δ32 mutation were shown to have significantly higher viremia levels of hepatitis C virus than their counterparts who have the normal form of CCR5 (1717. Woitas, R. P., Ahlenstiel, G., Brackmann, H. H., Matz, B., Rockstroh, J. K., and Spengler, U. (2001) The 8th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunisitc Infections, Chicago, February 4-8, 2001, p. 499 (abs).Google Scholar). In this regard, we have most recently identified a number of spirodiketopiperazine-based E913 analogues that exert extremely more potent activity to block R5 HIV-1 replication than E913 (up to 1000-fold greater) but permit the CC-chemokine-induced Ca2+flux, 2K. Maeda, T. Miyakawa, and H. Mitsuya, unpublished data. suggesting that the CC-chemokine-binding domain and glycoprotein-120-binding domain on CCR5 are distant enough for the intrusion of such small anti-HIV-1 molecules, and/or that a conformational change of CCR5, which blocks glycoprotein-120 binding but does not block CC-chemokine binding, can occur following the initial contact of such small anti-HIV-1 molecules to CCR5.Our present observation that LD78β variants such as LD78βP8A and LD78βD6A retained their chemokine functions yet acquired more potent activity to suppress R5 HIV-1 replication seems imperative, because it may prompt the development of agents that permit physiological triggering of signal transduction and exert potent antiviral activity against HIV-1. LD78β variants with appropriate amino acid substitution(s) may serve as an effective chemokine-based anti-HIV-1 therapeutic(s) preserving the LD78β-CCR5 interaction. Taken together, the present data showed that three amino acid residues, Pro-2, Asp-6, Pro-8, and Thr-9, are more critical for LD78β binding to CCR5 and inhibition of R5 HIV-1 replication than other amino acid residues in the NH2terminus of LD78β. The conformational changes caused by amino acid substitutions to Ala at these residues are to be clarified with crystallographic and/or NMR analyses of this region upon interaction with CCR5.

However, there is a concern that the sustained long term suppression of the effects of chemokine-chemokine receptor interaction may produce significant adverse effects. In fact, hepatitis C virus-infected individuals with CCR5-Δ32 mutation have recently been reported to have significantly higher viremia levels of the hepatitis C virus than those with the normal form of CCR5 (1717. Woitas, R. P., Ahlenstiel, G., Brackmann, H. H., Matz, B., Rockstroh, J. K., and Spengler, U. (2001) The 8th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunisitc Infections, Chicago, February 4-8, 2001, p. 499 (abs).Google Scholar). Thus, the agents that block the cellular entry of HIV-1 through the inhibition of HIV-1 binding to chemokine receptors but do not block the chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions are thought to be more suitable as therapeutics for HIV infection. The natural CCR5 ligands MIP-1α (also named LD78α), MIP-1β, and RANTES bind to CCR5 receptors and can block R5 HIV-1 replication (18Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (2621) Google Scholar). The LD78 gene family consists of a variety of genes presumably evolved through duplications, deletions, and/or mutations (19Obaru K. Fukuda M. Maeda S. Shimada K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Obaru K. Hattori T. Yamamura Y. Takatsuki K. Nomiyama H. Maeda S. Shimada K. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two major LD78 variants, LD78α and LD78β, represent highly related isoforms. LD78β is reportedly more potent in cellular Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis induction and the activity against HIV-1 by ∼10-fold compared with LD78α (21Nibbs R.J. Yang J. Landau N.R. Mao J.H. Graham G.J. J.

It is thought that an interaction of the NH2 terminus of LD78 and the second extracellular loop of CCR5 is critical for the initiation of signal transduction (24Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In this study, in an attempt to elucidate which amino acid(s) plays a critical role in the interaction of LD78β and its receptor CCR5 and how the NH2 terminus of LD78β is associated with its inhibitory activity against HIV-1, we generated six LD78β variants with an amino acid substituted to Ala at the NH2 terminus of LD78β and questioned the structure-activity relationships. We found that there was no significant difference in Ca2+flux and chemotaxis induction among the variants examined with the exception of an LD78β variant whose Thr-9 was substituted with Ala (LD78βT9A) that showed a moderately reduced activity, whereas LD78βP2A and LD78βT9A had significantly reduced CCR5 down-regulation. We also found that LD78βD6A and LD78βP8A exerted the greatest anti-HIV-1 activity among the variants examined. The present data suggest that the modification of LD78β may produce more potent biologic agents against HIV-1 and that certain LD78β variants with an appropriate amino acid substitution(s) may serve as an effective chemokine-based therapeutic(s) against HIV-1 infection preserving the LD78β CCR5 interaction. DISCUSSIONIn this work, in an attempt to determine which amino acids in the NH2 terminus of LD78β are critical in its interaction with CCR5, we generated six LD78β variants with an amino acid substituted to Ala at the NH2 terminus of LD78β recombinant. We then found that the substitution of Pro-2, Asp-6, Pro-8, and Thr-9 caused significant changes in LD78β binding to CCR5 and inhibition of R5 HIV-1 replication. It is noteworthy that although all the LD78β variants with the exception of LD78βT9Ahad comparable activity to induce intracellular Ca2+ flux, their activity to inhibit R5 HIV-1 replication varied substantially. These data suggest that the competence of LD78β to induce signal transduction does not parallel with its competence to block the infectivity of R5 HIV-1. When we compared the order of HIV-1 replication inhibition, it was LD78βP8A > LD78βD6A > LD78βWT, LD78βL3A> LD78βT7A, LD78βP2A > LD78βT9A. When we further examined CCR5 binding affinity of LD78β variants exploiting heterologous displacement assays (Fig.6 A) using CCR5-Molt4 cells and 2D7 monoclonal antibody that binds to CCR5-ECL2A, the comparative order for 2D7 displacement was LD78βP8A, LD78βD6A > LD78βWT> LD78βL3A > LD78βT7A > LD78βP2A, LD78βT9A. These results were corroborated with the results of 125I-MIP-1α binding inhibition by LD78βWT and variants (Fig. 6 B). These data together suggested that LD78β binding to CCR5 regardless of affinity is sufficient for signal transduction, whereas the greater magnitude of the binding is required for the greater anti-HIV-1 activity. In respect to analyzing the activity to block HIV-1 replication of LD78α and LD78β, Nibbs et al. (21Nibbs R.J. Yang J. Landau N.R. Mao J.H. Graham G.J. J. Biol.

Simmons et al. (41Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Picard L. Offord R.E. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Buser R. Wells T.N. Proudfoot A.E.

Taken together, the present data suggest that certain LD78β variants with an appropriate amino acid substitution such as LD78βD6Aand LD78βP8A may serve as an effective chemokine-based anti-HIV-1 therapeutic(s) while preserving LD78β-CCR5 interactions.

LD78β variants with appropriate amino acid substitution(s) may serve as an effective chemokine-based anti-HIV-1 therapeutic(s) preserving the LD78β-CCR5 interaction. Taken together, the present data showed that three amino acid residues, Pro-2, Asp-6, Pro-8, and Thr-9, are more critical for LD78β binding to CCR5 and inhibition of R5 HIV-1 replication than other amino acid residues in the NH2terminus of LD78β. The conformational changes caused by amino acid substitutions to Ala at these residues are to be clarified with crystallographic and/or NMR analyses of this region upon interaction with CCR5.

The clustered neuronal nAchRs subunit genes, α3 and β4, are expressed in amacrine and ganglion cells where they are used to assemble functional receptor subtypes. The transcriptional mechanisms underlying expression of these subunits in retina are not yet known but may involve enhancers that are selectively active in retinal neurons. We previously identified a neuron-selective enhancer, β43′, whose activity in neural cell lines is dependent on ETS domain-binding sites. To determine whether β43′ is active in retinal neurons that express the α3 and β4 genes, we investigated β43′ activity in primary dissociated rat retinal cultures. We found that β43′ is selectively active in retinal neurons compared with retinal non-neuronal cells. This activity was derived primarily from amacrine and ganglion neurons, which are the retinal neuron cell types that express the clustered genes. Moreover, β43′ was selectively active in retinal neurons compared with cerebral cortical neurons suggesting that it is not a pan-neuronal enhancer. ETS factor-binding sites in the enhancer are required for its retinal neuron activity.

Before a neuron can assemble and assign a specific physiological function to a particular nAchR subtype, however, the appropriate combination of subunit mRNAs must be expressed in that cell. In contrast to the growing understanding of the expression and function of nAchRs in retinal neurons, nothing is known about the transcriptional mechanisms that direct expression of α3 and β4 genes to these cells. The α3 gene promoter does not appear to contain cell type-specific information, which has led us to hypothesize that the clustered nAchR genes are under transcription control of neuron-selective enhancers (18McDonough J. Francis N. Miller T. Deneris E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, we identified an enhancer located in the β4 3′-untranslated region about 2.5 kb upstream of the α3 gene, which is currently the only known enhancer element in the cluster (19McDonough J. Deneris E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two distinct cis elements within the β43′ enhancer that bind ETS domain factors are required for its activity in neural cell lines (18McDonough J. Francis N. Miller T. Deneris E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interest in this enhancer as an essential component of regulatory information in the cluster arises from its differential activity in different cell types. First, it displays neural cell type-specific activity in a manner that correlates well with expression of the endogenous clustered genes in cell lines. Second, transfection experiments in dissociated peripheral primary neuron/non-neuronal cell cultures have shown that expression of reporter genes that are controlled by β43′ is largely limited to neurons (18McDonough J. Francis N. Miller T. Deneris E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These characteristics support the idea that ETS domain factor interactions with β43′ are important for neuron-selective transcriptional control of one or more genes in the cluster. Because the enhancer is located between the α3 and β4 promoters and the α3 and β4 genes are expressed in retina, β43′ may control retinal neuron expression of these genes. However, it is not yet known whether β43′ is active in retinal neurons. Here we have transfected dissociated rat primary neuron/non-neuronal retinal cell cultures with luciferase reporters to determine whether β43′ is active in retinal neurons. The data presented suggest that β43′ is a retinal neuron enhancer that may control expression of the cluster genes in these cells through interactions with ETS domain factors. The pGL3 vector series (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was used to prepare luciferase reporter constructs. The rat β43′-(1–90) sequences and mutations or deletions of it were prepared using three-way ligations of vector and synthetic oligonucleotides as described (18McDonough J. Francis N. Miller T. Deneris E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The AdMLP construct contains sequences −55/+10 of the adenovirus 2 major late promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter. β43′-(1–90) has identical activity to β43′-(1–107) (18McDonough J. Francis N. Miller T. Deneris E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter construct, the GFP reporter was cloned from enhanced GFP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA; gift of T. Large) in place of the luciferase gene in the β43′/α3P construct using restriction sites. All other reporters used in this study were described previously (18McDonough J. Francis N. Miller T. Deneris E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). β43′ reporters prepared using synthetic oligonucleotides were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using Sequenase reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences); all other constructs were confirmed by restriction digests. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen, and plasmids for transfections were prepared using Qiagen reagents (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). At least two different plasmid preparations were used for each construct, and all constructs were tested in at least three independent experiments. Retinas were dissected from P1 Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Zivic Miller, Portersville, PA) and dissociated in dispase/collagenase or 5 mg/ml dispase alone (in the course of these experiments it was found that cell viability was much better when dissociation was carried out with dispase alone) for 12–15 min. Following a rinse in serum-containing medium, retinas were triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette in serum-containing medium with 3.5% bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen), and ∼5 × 105 cells were plated into each well of poly-l-lysine- and laminin-coated 24-well plates or onto 12-mm glass coverslips (Fisher). Cells for 6–8 wells of a 24-well plate were typically obtained from each animal (two retinas). Cultures were allowed to grow for 3 or 7 days before transfection, with fresh media added every 3 days. Cultured neurons had similar morphologies at 3 and 7 days in vitro, but we found that transfection efficiencies were much higher after 7 days in vitro (compare numbers in Tables I and II). Cultures used for immunocytochemistry (ICC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Celox, St. Paul, MN) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cultures used for luciferase assays were plated in the same media but changed to serum-free medium after about 24 h. In serum-free cultures, non-neuronal cells did not proliferate extensively; transfection efficiency was less variable, and neurons were transfected much more efficiently than non-neuronal cells. ICC results under serum-free conditions indicate that greater than 90% of the reporter-expressing cells are neurons, even when the SV40P/SV40E (which is expressed at high levels in non-neuronal cells, see below) is used. Serum-free conditions were therefore used to analyze β43′ elements using quantitative reporter assays. Serum-free medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with insulin/transferrin/selenium (Sigma), penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mg/ml sodium pyruvate (Sigma), bovine serum albumin (1.5%), and 10 ng/ml recombinant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) to increase survival of retinal ganglion cells (20Johnson J.E. Barde Y.A. Schwab M. Thoenen H. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3031-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of cultures in human brain-derived neurotrophic factor did not change relative reporter activities. Calcium phosphate transfections were performed essentially as described (21Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) including in some cases a 4-min treatment with 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at the end of the transfection period to increase transfection consistency (21Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Me2SO treatment was non-essential for cultures grown under serum-free conditions. Serum-free cultures were typically incubated with the calcium phosphate precipitate 35–45 min. Two μg of reporter DNA were used per transfection for luciferase assays and 4 μg for ICC. In some experiments, an internal control plasmid (RSV-β-gal) was co-transfected; β-galactosidase correction of luciferase data produced similar results to those reported here (data not shown).Table ICumulative data for luciferase-expressing neurons and non-neuronal cells in retinal cultures, 3 days in vitroReporterNo. neuronsNo non-neuronal cellsSumnAverage % neurons ± S.E.p value vs.SV40E/SV40Pp value vs. β43′/α3PSV40E/SV40P2921514431547 ± 8<0.0001β43′/α3P12012712281497 ± 2<0.0001β43′/AdMLP11088011881297 ± 1<0.00010.98β43′/SV40P993181011992 ± 3<0.00010.63rβ43′/α3P29352981099 ± 1<0.00010.83SV40E/α3P56851411637 ± 90.25<0.0001 Open table in a new tab Table IICumulative data for luciferase-expressing neurons and non-neuronal cells in retinal cultures, 7 days in vitroReporterNo. neuronsNo. non-neuronal cellsSumnAverage % neurons ± S.E.p value vs. SV40E/SV40Pp value vs.β43′/α3PSV40E/SV40P2946422071661432 ± 6<0.0001β43′/α3P325819734551292 ± 1<0.0001β43′/AdMLP219049126811065 ± 80.00030.0025β43′/SV40P19214692390873 ± 8<0.00010.0454rβ43′/α3P11261021228487 ± 7<0.00010.705rβ43′/SV40P29663553321582 ± 5<0.00010.352rβ43′/AdMLP560870863161179 ± 7<0.00010.1411rβ43′/SV40E/SV40P219622314427842 ± 70.29<0.0001SV40E/α3P1008149525031326 ± 60.396<0.0001 Open table in a new tab Cerebral cortices from P1 or E18 rats (Zivic Miller) were dissected free of meninges, dissociated in dispase/collagenase, rinsed in serum-containing medium, and triturated. Cultures were plated on poly-l-lysine and laminin, grown overnight in serum-containing medium, and changed to serum-free medium. Serum-free medium for cortical cultures consisted of Neurobasal medium with B-27 supplement (both from Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin. Cortical cultures were transfected after 5 days in vitro using calcium phosphate as described for retinal cultures. Similar to retinal cultures, neurons were transfected much more efficiently than non-neuronal cells in these culture conditions so that nearly all of the luciferase activity of reporters is derived from neurons. Luciferase assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) 24 h after transfection. Cells were lysed in 75 μl of lysis buffer per well of 24-well plates, and 10 μl of the lysate were assayed in 50 μl of luciferin substrate using a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (EG & G Berthold, Nashua, NH). For ICC, cells were fixed for 25–30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. ICC was carried out as described (22Francis N.J. Asmus S.E. Landis S.C. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using the following antibody dilutions: rabbit anti-luciferase (Accurate Chemicals, Westbury, NY) 1:1000; mouse anti-βIII tubulin (Sigma) 1:3000; monoclonal antibody VC1.1 (Sigma) 1:3000; rabbit anti-L1 (gift of V.

Coverslips were mounted in PBS/glycerol. All ICC/IHC data were analyzed on a Nikon microscope. Cell counts were performed directly from immunostained coverslips. Photomicrographs were digitally processed from color slides or black and white prints using Adobe Photoshop. RNase Protection RNA was isolated from retinal cultures grown 4 days in serum-free medium using RNazol (Tel-Test, Friendsville, TX); 10–20 μg of RNA was used for each protection reaction. PC12 cell RNA was used as a positive control, and Rat2 RNA was used as a negative control for both Pet-1 and α3 (23Fyodorov D. Nelson T. Deneris E. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 34: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RNase protection was carried out using the RPAII kit (Ambion, Dallas Center, IA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The α3 (24Mandelzys A. Pie B. Deneris E.S. Cooper E. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Pet-1 (23Fyodorov D. Nelson T. Deneris E. J.

Reverse transcription was carried out with 1–4 μg using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 35 cycles of PCR at 60 (ERM, ER81) or 55 °C (PEA3) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermal cycler.

Mini-nuclear extracts were prepared from retinal cultures that had been grown in vitro for 4 days essentially as described (27Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), removed from the substrate with trypsin, collected by centrifugation, and washed again in PBS. Cells were resuspended in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9; 10% glycerol; 10 mm KCl; 0.1 mm EDTA; 0.1 mm EGTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 4 μg/ml leupeptin; 1 μg/ml aprotinin; 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Nonidet P-40 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (final concentration 0.5%) was added immediately, and the cells were mixed by inverting several times. Nuclei were pelleted by brief centrifugation at 4 °C and extracted with Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9; 0.4 m NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mmEGTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; protease inhibitors). Extracts were microcentrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Bio-Rad) and were typically 2–6 μg/μl. One to three 60-mm dishes of retinal cells grown in serum-free medium were routinely used for extract preparation, yielding 50–150 μl of nuclear extract. For EMSA, 10 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide consisting of most of the sequence of the first repeat (R1) (Table III) was radiolabeled with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and purified by G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) spun column chromatography. Nuclear extract (2–10 μg) was incubated with competitors, in 1.5× TGE buffer (75 mm Tris, 570 mm glycine, 3 mm EDTA), 33 mm KCl, 8% glycerol, poly(dI-dC) (1 μg/reaction), and protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice. After addition of 0.1 pmol of probe (5–10 × 104 cpm), reactions were further incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Before loading, 10 μl of 1× TGE, 10% glycerol were added to each reaction. Reactions were separated on 6% polyacrylamide, 0.5× TGE, 10% glycerol gels in 0.5× TGE for 2–3 h at 25–40 V at 4 °C, dried, and exposed to film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 24 h.Table IIIOligonucleotides used for EMSAOligoSequenceR1GGCTTATACAAGGAAGTGGCATTGGAR1 ETSmGATCATGGGAAGGCTTATACAAtacAGTGGCATTGGAGCAGAGCR2TGCATGACTAGGGAAGGCTTATACAAGGAAATGACACTGGAGCACAGR2 ETSmTGCATGACTAGGGAAGGCTTATACAAtacAATGACACTGGAGCACAGETS2 (52)TCGACCGGAAGTACTTCCGGTCETS2mTCGACCtacAGTACTgtaGGTCPU.1/GABPα (26)GGGCTGCTTGAGGAAGTATAAGAATGABPαm GGGCTGCTTGAGtacGTATAAGAATPEA3 (53)CTCGAGCAGGAAGTTCGAPEA3mCTCGAGCAtactGTTCGAER81 (26)TTATAGGCGGATGTGGCATCRα (35)CCTCTTCTTTCCAGAGGATGTGGCTTCTGCGATCRαmCCTCTTCTTTCCAGAtacTGTGGCTTCTGCGAThe GGA core motif and the base changes in mutant (m) oligos are in bold.

To confirm that α3-expressing neurons were present in primary retinal cultures, RNase protection was carried out with RNA from cultures grown 4 days in vitro. α3 mRNA was clearly detected in RNA samples obtained from several different independent cultures, consistent with the presence of retinal ganglion and amacrine cells (Fig.1). By having confirmed that retinal cultures are a valid system in which to assay transcriptional elements present in the neuronal nAchR gene cluster, we set out to investigate whether β43′ is active in retinal neurons. Dissociated retinal cultures were composed of about 10% neuron-specific tubulin-immunoreactive neurons after 3 days in vitro and only 2–3% after 7 days in vitro because of extensive non-neuronal cell proliferation. The majority of the non-neuronal cells were immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggesting the presence of Müller glial cells, although a small number of Thy-1-positive fibroblasts were also present (data not shown). When retinal cultures were transfected after 3 days in vitro with a luciferase reporter carrying β43′-(1–90) upstream of the α3 promoter (β43′/α3), nearly 100% of the luciferase-expressing cells were neurons (Fig.2, A, B, and E, and Table I). The same result was obtained with β43′ in reverse orientation (Fig. 2 E and TableI). To demonstrate that non-neuronal cells can be efficiently transfected in these cultures, we scored luciferase-positive neurons and non-neuronal cells after transfection of a luciferase reporter carrying the SV40 promoter and SV40 enhancer (SV40E/SV40P). In clear contrast to that found for β43′/α3, approximately equal numbers of neurons and non-neuronal cells were luciferase-positive over the course of 15 independent experiments with the SV40E/SV40P reporter (Fig. 2,C, D, and E). The difference in the percentage of neurons expressing the luciferase reporter driven by β43′versus SV40E was highly significant (Table I). Because the ratio of luciferase-positive neurons and non-neuronal cells is ∼1:1 in SV40E/SV40P transfections, rather than the 1:9 that would be expected based on the composition of the cultures, it is possible that SV40E/SV40P also has a cell type-specific bias toward expression in neurons. However, we cannot distinguish this possibility from an alternative explanation, which is a bias toward transfection of neurons in these experiments. Nevertheless, the finding that both neurons and non-neuronal cells express the SV40 reporter demonstrates that both types of cells were transfected. Thus, the highly significant difference in cell type-specific activity between SV40E/SV40P and β43′/α3 supports the idea that the β43′ enhancer is a transcriptional element that together with the α3 promoter is able to drive retinal neuron-specific gene expression. To determine whether the α3 promoter is required for neuron-selective expression in retinal cultures, assays were performed with reporters, β43′/SV40P and β43′/AdMLP, in which the α3 promoter was replaced with either the adenoviral major late (AdMLP) or the simian virus 40 (SV40) promoters. Both of these promoters are essentially TATA boxes and therefore are not expected to direct cell type-specific transcription on their own. In cultures transfected after 3 daysin vitro with either reporter, the majority of the luciferase-expressing cells were neurons regardless of β43′ orientation (Fig. 2 E and Table I). When retinal cultures were transfected with a reporter carrying the α3 promoter and SV40 enhancer (SV40E/α3P), more non-neuronal cells than neurons expressed detectable luciferase, similar to what was seen with SV40E/SV40P (Fig.2 E, Table I). This further confirms that both neurons and non-neuronal cells were being transfected but that β43′-driven reporters are preferentially expressed in neurons. Thus, the neuron-selective activity of β43′ does not require the α3 promoter, and this promoter is not sufficient to direct a neuronal pattern of gene expression in retinal cultures. We conclude that the β43′ enhancer is both necessary and sufficient to drive neuron-selective expression in these cultures. We next investigated whether β43′ neuron selectivity is maintained under conditions in which the ratio of non-neuronal cells to neurons is increased in cultures. To test this, we transfected cultures with the various reporters after 7 days in vitro; this incidentally resulted in higher transfection efficiencies (compare luciferase-positive cells in Tables I and II). As before, neither SV40E/SV40P nor SV40E /α3P supported neuron-selective expression of luciferase. In contrast, when β43′/α3P was transfected ∼90% of the luciferase-expressing cells were neurons regardless of β43′ orientation (Fig. 3 and TableII). Thus neuron selectivity was maintained even when neurons constituted only a small percentage of the cells in culture. Significantly more neurons were luciferase-positive in cultures transfected with either β43′/SV40P or β43′/AdMLP than with SV40P/SV40E. The percentage of luciferase-positive cells that were neurons, however, was lower in transfections with β43′/SV40P or β43′/AdMLP than in cultures transfected with β43′/α3P (Fig. 3 and Table II); this difference was statistically significant in some cases. These results suggest that the discrimination of β43′ between neurons and non-neuronal cells may be supported by its natural promoter. β43′ could achieve neuron selectivity by silencing promoter activity in non-neuronal cells. To test this idea, we transfected retinal cultures with reporters driven by both the β43′ and SV40 enhancers and the SV40 promoter. If β43′ silences promoter activity in non-neuronal cells, this construct should have similar neuron specificity to reporters driven by β43′ alone. We found, however, that this reporter is highly expressed in both neurons and non-neuronal cells (Table II), suggesting β43′ does not silence promoter activity in non-neuronal cells. Both retinal ganglion cells and amacrine cells in the ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers of the retina express α3 and β4 mRNA from about E13 into maturity (7Hamassaki-Britto D.E.

To determine whether β43′-driven reporters are also expressed in amacrine and ganglion cells, we quantitated colocalization of retinal cell type markers with β43′-driven GFP. Two retinal ganglion cell markers were used, L1 and Thy-1. The localization of β43′-driven GFP to ganglion cells was first tested by immunostaining against the cell adhesion molecule L1, which is specific for ganglion cells in the retina (2"

Recently, the discipline of pharmacogenics has shown that unique variations in genetic traits among individuals can produce substantial inter-individual variation in the disposition and metabolism of delivered drugs. Indeed, apparently mild polymorphisms can result in profound phenotypic differences among different individuals (1Evans W.E. Relling M.V. Science. 1999; 286: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar, 2Meyer U.A. Zanger U.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 269-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Genetic polymorphisms also appear to affect in vivo gene delivery. However, studies to date have focused almost exclusively on differences in mouse strain-dependent acquired immune responses, and their effects on the duration of gene expression produced by recombinant viral vectors, as well as on the ability of these vectors to re-express heterologous genes upon re-injection of the virus (3Barr D.

The potential effects of genetic variations on the disposition and subsequent expression of genes delivered by non-viral carriers in vivo have not been reported. Intravenous gene delivery requires a multistep process of DNA transfer and expression events to transfect target tissues and cells. This process can be inhibited at one or more discrete steps, occurring anywhere from injection into the vascular compartment to expression in the nucleus of the transfected cell. In a mammalian host, steps thought to play important roles in limiting the delivery and/or expression of intravenously injected cationic liposome·DNA complexes (CLDC) 1The abbreviations used are:CLDCcationic liposome·DNA complexGREglucocorticoid response elementGRglucocorticoid receptorMLVmultilamellar vesicleFBSfetal bovine serumRSVRous sarcoma virusDOTIM1-[2-(9(Z)-octadecenoyloxy)-ethyl]-2-(8(Z)-heptadecenyl)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)imidazolinium chlorideDOGSdioctadecylamido-glycylspermineHCMVhuman cytomegalovirus include survival within the vascular compartment, accessing target cells both within and beyond the vascular compartment, internalization by cells to which CLDC bind, and entry of delivered DNA into the nucleus (particularly of non-dividing cells) (8–34). Each step is likely to be regulated by one or more host genes. Using two different outbred strains and one inbred mouse strain, we determined that strain-related genetic differences play an important role in regulating the efficiency of both intravenous, CLDC-based gene delivery and expression.

Formula A (D5W) was prepared as described previously (22Liu Y. Liggitt D. Zhong W., Tu, G. Gaensler K. Debs R. J. Biol.

Specifically, 40 μg of plasmid DNA complexed to either 640 nm DOTIM:cholesterol (total lipid) MLV or to 720 nm DOGS:cholesterol MLV were each dissolved in 100 μl of D5W. The DNA and liposomes were then mixed together by adding the DNA solution to the liposome solution, and the mixture was gently pipetted up and down twice. Formula B was prepared by dissolving the DNA in a 100-μl solution containing dextran 40 (Sigma Chemical Co.) and lactated Ringer's solution at a ratio of 9:1 (volume:volume), the liposomes were dissolved in 100 μl of Ringer's solution, and the DNA and the liposome solution was mixed as above. Formula C was prepared by dissolving the DNA in 100 μl of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini, CA) and the liposomes in 100 μl of lactated Ringer's solution. Formula D was prepared by dissolving DNA in 70 μl of FBS and dissolving the liposomes in 70 μl of D5W. After mixing the dissolved DNA and liposomes together, 60 μl of lactated Ringer's solution was added to the mixture and pipetted up and down gently twice to mix well. Six-week-old, female CD-1/ICR, Swiss Webster, and FVB mice were purchased from Simonson laboratories (Gilroy, CA). All mice were certified to be free of common murine pathogens. Six-week-old, female ICR, Swiss Webster, and FVB mice were purchased from Simonson laboratories. All mice were housed in the CPMC animal care facility for 1 week before receiving treatment. ICR, FVB, and Swiss Webster mice in groups of five individually received identical CLDC containing 40 μg of pHCMV-luc complexed to DOTIM:cholesterol MLV at a 1:16 ratio (micrograms of DNA to nanomolar of total lipids) in a 200-μl total volume of D5W intravenously.

Behr, 720 nm DOGS:cholesterol MLV at a 1:18 ratio (micrograms of DNA to nanomolar of total lipids) in a 200-μl total volume of D5W, intravenously. Twenty-four hours after injection, mice were sacrificed and heart, spleen, liver, and lungs tissues were collected and assayed for luciferase activity, as previously described (23Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Individual mice in groups of five received either: (a) 200 μl of D5W only by intravenous injection; (b) 1 mg of dexamethasone (Sigma Chemical Co.) in 200 μl of D5W by intravenous injection; (c) 250 μg of ticlopidine (Sigma) dissolved in 200 μl of D5W by intravenous injection; or (d) 175 μg of ammonium chloride (Fisher) dissolved in 1000 μl of D5W by intraperitoneal injection, each administered 4 h before intravenous injection of CLDC. CLDC containing 40 μg of 4241 complexed to DOTIM:cholesterol MLV at a 1:16 ratio (micrograms of plasmid DNA to nanomolar of total lipid) in 200 μl of D5W were injected intravenous per mouse. All pre-treated groups then received CLDC containing 40 μg of p4241 (CMV-luc) complexed to DOTIM:cholesterol MLV at a 1:16 ratio (micrograms of plasmid DNA to nanomolar of total lipid) were then injected intravenously in 200 μl of D5W. Twenty-four hours after CLDC injection, mice were sacrificed in a CO2 chamber. Heart, spleen, lung, and liver were collected and analyzed for either luciferase levels or DNA level by Southern analysis, as previously described (23Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Relative light units were converted to luciferase levels using a standard curve as previously described (23Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The potential statistical significance of differences was assessed using an unpaired, two sided Student'st test. Equal sized pieces of lung and liver were collected and prepared for Southern analysis as previously described (23Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). DNA was quantitated by phosphorimaging as previously described (23Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The potential statistical significance of differences in all experiments was assessed using an unpaired, two sided Student's t test. We first compared luciferase plasmid DNA delivery, as well as luciferase activity in three different mouse strains; two outbred (Swiss Webster and ICR/CD-1), and one inbred (FVB). All mice tested were female, of comparable size and age, obtained from the same vendor, and all were housed and fed under identical conditions. Twenty-four hours after intravenous injection of DOTIM:cholesterol MLV complexed to 40 μg of an HCMV-luc expression plasmid per mouse, tissues harvested from ICR mice showed significantly higher luciferase activities than either FVB or Swiss Webster mice (Fig.1 A). Luciferase activity in the lungs of ICR mice was ∼11-fold higher than in FVB mice (p < 0.0005) and 26-fold higher than in Swiss Webster mice (p < 0.0005). Spleens from ICR mice also showed ∼6- and 9-fold higher luciferase activities than the spleens of FVB (p < 0.025) and Swiss Webster (p < 0.025) mice, respectively. Luciferase activity in the livers of ICR mice was 3.4-fold higher (p < 0.05) than that found in the livers of Swiss Webster mice. Conversely, levels of tissue luciferase activity in Swiss Webster and FVB mice (the low expresser strains) were similar in most tissues and differed significantly (p < 0.025) only in spleen (Fig. 1 A). Whereas the level of luciferase activity was significantly higher in ICR than FVB mice (Fig. 1 A), levels of DNA delivery to tissues of these two strains were similar (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, recovery of luciferase DNA from the lungs of Swiss Webster mice was ∼2-fold lower than from the lungs of ICR mice (p < 0.005) and FVB mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1 B). The ratio of gene expression level to DNA level in the lungs of Swiss Webster and FVB mice was quite similar, but was 12-fold higher in ICR mice. Therefore, strain-related differences in the expression of intravenously CLDC-delivered genes can be caused either by differences in the overall tissue delivery and/or by differences in the efficiency of expression of the intravenously injected DNA expression vector. We next attempted to identify drug pretreatments that affect the efficiency of intravenous, CLDC-based gene transfer in a strain-specific manner. ICR mice pre-treated with dexamethasone showed substantially higher levels of gene expression in all tissues assayed, when compared with pretreatment with D5W alone (Fig.2 A). Specifically, luciferase activity was 2.9-fold higher in the lungs (p < 0.005), 5.3-fold higher in heart (p < 0.05), 4.5-fold higher in spleen (p < 0.005), and 3.6-fold higher in liver (p < 0.025) than in the ICR group receiving D5W pretreatment alone (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with dexamethasone failed in most tissues assayed to increase luciferase activity (Fig. 2 B). Pre-treatment with ammonium chloride produced similarly low, but still statistically significant increases in tissue luciferase activity in both ICR and Swiss Webster mice (Fig. 2 B). Unlike dexamethasone or ammonium chloride, pre-treatment with ticlopidine did not significantly alter the efficiency of intravenous, CLDC-gene delivery in either strain. Thus, of the three agents tested, both ammonium chloride and dexamethasone were able to increase expression levels. However, whereas ammonium chloride increased expression in both strains tested, the dexamethasone-mediated increase was specific to ICR mice. Concurrently, we assessed whether dexamethasone, which increased intravenous, CLDC-based gene expression in ICR mice (Fig. 2 A), significantly altered the tissue delivery of the HCMV-luc plasmid to either lung or liver of ICR or Swiss Webster mice. Specifically, dexamethasone significantly (p < 0.05) increased the tissue delivery of pHCMV-luc DNA in the lung and liver of both ICR and Swiss Webster mice (Fig. 2 C). Thus, dexamethasone increased the localization but decreased the expression efficiency in Swiss Webster mice, whereas in ICR mice it increased both the localization of DNA and the expression efficiency. Previously, the HCMV promoter has been shown to contain multiple repeat sequences with significant homology to consensus GRE sequences (38Malone R.W. Hickman M.A. Lehmann-Bruinsma K. Sih T.R. Walzem R. Carlson D.M. Powell J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29903-29907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed whether these putative GRE elements within the HCMV promoter might be responsible for the significant induction of intravenous, CLDC-based gene expression in ICR mice due to the presence of dexamethasone (Fig. 2 A). To test this hypothesis, we used pGRE5-luc, an expression plasmid containing a minimal synthetic promoter consisting of five high affinity GREs placed upstream of the adenovirus major late promoter TATA region. Gene expression from this promoter has been shown to be increased from 10- to >50-fold in cultured cells in the presence of dexamethasone (37Mader S. White J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5603-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To ensure that the concentration of theglucocorticoid receptor (GR) was not rate-limiting in either cells or animals, we tested the dexamethasone responsiveness of the pGRE5-luc plasmid, either alone or co-transfected with pRSV-GR, containing the RSV promoter/enhancer linked to the rat GR (36Godowski P.J. Rusconi S. Miesfeld R. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1987; 325: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The low, baseline level of gene expression from pGRE5-luc in B16 melanoma cells co-transfected with pRSV-GR was increased 489-fold in the presence of dexamethasone (Fig.3 A). Conversely, the high baseline level of gene expression from p4377, pHCMV-luc, in B16 cells co-transfected with pGRE5-luc was increased was less than 2-fold in the presence of dexamethasone (Fig. 3 A). These cell transfection experiments confirmed that pGRE5-luc is highly dexamethasone-responsive, whereas the HCMV-luc vector showed minimal dexamethasone responsiveness in cultured cells. We then tested the dexamethasone responsiveness of both the pGRE5-luc and pHCMV-luc plasmids, following their intravenous, CLDC-based injection into ICR mice. As expected, in the absence of dexamethasone, the HCMV-driven expression plasmid produced substantial levels of tissue luciferase activity, whereas the minimal promoter-GRE-driven expression plasmid, co-injected with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene reporter plasmid produced very low levels of tissue luciferase activity. However, unlike the results obtained in cultured cells (Fig. 3 A), dexamethasone pretreatment of ICR mice significantly (p < 0.05) increased gene expression from intravenously injected pHCMV-luc but had little effect on the expression of pGRE5-luc (Fig. 3 B). Overall, dexamethasone significantly induced gene expression from pGRE5-luc, but not from pHCMV-luc in cultured cells, whereas it increased gene expression from pHCMV-luc, but not from pGRE5-luc in ICR mice. Fig.4 shows the activity of intravenous, CLDC formulated in either 5%w/v glucose, (our customary diluent), or in one of three modified diluents described under “Experimental Procedures.” When compared with CLDC formulated in D5W, CLDC formulated in either of the other three diluents produced significantly higher levels of luciferase activity in Swiss Webster mice (Fig.4 A). The levels of luciferase activity in the lungs of Swiss Webster mice were ∼21-fold higher for CLDC diluted in dextran/Ringer’s (p < 0.05), and ∼3.5-fold higher for CLDC diluted in fetal bovine serum (FBS)/Ringer’s (p < 0.05), when compared with mice receiving CLDC diluted in the standard D5W solution. Luciferase activities were also significantly higher in heart (p < 0.05), spleen (p < 0.025), and liver (p < 0.025) in Swiss Webster mice injected with CLDC diluted in dextran/Ringer’s. CLDC diluted in dextran/Ringer’s and FBS/D5W/Ringer’s also produced significantly higher levels of luciferase activity in the spleens of Swiss Webster mice, but to a lesser extent than CLDC diluted in dextran/Ringer’s (Fig. 4 A). Conversely, the use of these alternative diluents generally did not significantly alter luciferase activities in tissues from ICR mice, when compared with D5W (Fig.4 B). These data suggest that, at least in some cases, reformulating CLDC can selectively convert the low expressor phenotype (here Swiss Webster mice) toward the high expressor phenotype (here ICR mice). Last, we compared two different cationic liposome formulations to further assess the effect of tissue delivery of intravenously injected CLDC on the level of gene expression produced. Previously, intravenous injection of CLDC containing either DOGS or DOTIM has been shown to produce significant levels of gene expression in a variety of different tissues (23Liu Y. Mounkes L.C.

We directly compared the abilities of identically prepared MLV, formulated using equimolar amounts of either DOTIM:cholesterol or DOGS:cholesterol, to deliver and to express pHCMV-luc, following intravenous, CLDC-based delivery in ICR (high expressor) mice. An HCMV-luc expression plasmid complexed to either DOGS:cholesterol MLV or DOTIM:cholesterol MLV at their optimal DNA:lipid ratios, as determined by prior ratio optimization screening (Ref. 23Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar and data not shown). Mice receiving CLDC containing DOGS:cholesterol MLV showed ∼26-fold higher luciferase DNA levels in the lung (p < 0.0005) and ∼9-fold higher levels in the liver (p < 0.0005), as determined by Southern analysis and phosphorimaging (23Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 A). Conversely, luciferase activity was 64-fold higher in the lung (p < 0.05) and 6-fold higher in the liver (p < 0.005) of DOTIM-treated mice (Fig. 5 B). Thus, each HCMC-lucplasmid delivered to tissues by DOTIM-containing liposomes was expressed ∼1650-fold more efficiently in the lung and expressed ∼54-fold more efficiently in the liver than the identical plasmid delivered by DOGS-containing liposomes. In addition, to determine to what extent the luciferase cDNA, from the HCMV-luc expression plasmid delivered by DOGS-containing CLDC, was present in tissues in an expressible state, we intravenously pre-injected dexamethasone 4 h prior to the injection of DOGS-containing-CLDC. Prior injection of dexamethasone significantly increased the expression of genes intravenously injected by DOTIM-containing CLDC in ICR mice (Fig. 2 A). Although pre-injection of dexamethasone did increase the levels of tissue luciferase activity produced by DOGS-containing CLDC (Fig.5 B), luciferase activity still remained one to two orders of magnitude below that produced by DOTIM-containing CLDC in the absence of dexamethasone (Fig. 5 B). Pre-injection of dexamethasone did not significantly increase tissue delivery of luciferase DNA following intravenously injection of DOGS-containing CLDC (Fig.5 A), consistent with the hypothesis that dexamethasone increased the expression of delivered genes at a step subsequent to tissue uptake. Overall, DOTIM-containing cationic liposomes achieved significantly higher levels of tissue gene expression, while producing much lower levels of tissue delivery of both the DNA and liposome components than DOGS-containing CLDC. Therefore, some cationic lipids appear to deliver plasmid DNA in a more expressible state, potentially by facilitating its uptake and/or intracellular targeting, or by more effectively protecting it from degradation. In the present study, we have found reproducible differences in the efficiency of both the delivery and the expression of intravenous, CLDC-injected genes among different mouse strains. ICR/CD-1 mice expressed intravenous, CLDC-injected genes significantly (p < 0.05) more efficiently in a variety of tissues than did either Swiss Webster or FVB mice (Fig. 1). The more efficient expression of genes injected into ICR mice appeared to be due both to delivery-related and expression-related events. Furthermore, the relative importance of delivery versus expression in determining the overall efficiency of intravenously injected CLDC appeared to be mouse strain-specific. For example, the level of tissue delivery of the injected expression plasmid was similar between ICR and FVB mice (Fig. 1 B). However, ICR mice appeared able to express plasmid DNA already resident in tissues more efficiently than did FVB mice. Conversely, both the tissue delivery and expression of injected genes were higher in ICR than Swiss Webster mice (Fig. 1). Although FVB and Swiss Webster mice showed a similar expression efficiency of intravenous, CLDC-delivered genes (Fig. 1 A), DNA localized two times more efficiently in FVB mice (Fig. 1,A and B). Thus, factors limiting the efficiency of intravenous, CLDC-based gene delivery appeared to be due to limitations imposed both by restricted tissue delivery as well as by the restricted expression of genes already taken up by tissues. These studies demonstrate that mouse strain-related genetic differences influence both the tissue delivery and subsequent expression of genes injected intravenously by CLDC. They suggest that human inter-individual genetic differences may play an important role in determining the efficiency of gene therapy, as they have been shown to do in drug therapy (1Evans W.E. Relling M.V. Science. 1999; 286: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar, 2Meyer U.A. Zanger U.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 269-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed whether selective modification of either host factors or CLDC formulation could compensate for genetically based differences in the efficiency of intravenous, CLDC-based gene delivery. We found that pre-injection of either dexamethasone or ammonium chloride (Fig. 2), as well as reformulating CLDC in a combination of dextran 40 and lactated Ringer's solution rather than D5W (Fig. 4) shifted gene transfer efficiency in low expressor Swiss Webster mice toward that of high expressor, ICR mice. These results suggest that a variety of alternative, non-viral gene transfer strategies may be required to compensate for inter-individual genetic differences that control the overall efficiency of this approach. Our results show that the host factors responsible for genetically based, inter-individual differences in gene transfer efficiency in whole animals are complex. Clearly, a more precise understanding of the specific cellular genes that regulate the trafficking and expression of injected DNA is required. Innate immune-response genes provide an example of candidate genes that may play a role in mediating strain-related differences in CLDC-based systemic gene transfer and expression. Differences in immune responsiveness may be one host factor that could account for the strain-related differences in the efficiency of intravenous, CLDC-mediated gene transfer and expression. For example, strain-related differences in immune responses have already been shown to play a significant role in regulating the duration of expression of genes delivered by recombinant viral vectors (3Barr D. Tubb J. Ferguson D. Scaria A. Lieber A. Wilson C. Perkins J. Kay M.A. Gene Ther. 1995; 2: 151-155PubMed Google Scholar, 4De Geest B. Van Linthout S. Collen D.

In many of these cases, lymphocytes and acquired immune responses play a critical role, particularly with respect to repeated gene delivery. In the case of intravenous CLDC gene delivery, however, the differences in gene expression occurred within 24 h of the first gene delivery, which appears to be too soon for acquired immunity to play a significant role. CLDC have been reported to be potent inducers of innate immune responses, including release of pre-inflammatory cytokines and activation of macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells (13Dow S.W.

Therefore, it is possible that the strain-related differences in gene expression observed in the studies reported here might be due, at least in part to differences in the relative sensitivities of innate immune responses to CLDC. However, given the very large number of cellular genes that could regulate the “transfection permissive phenotype,” identifying the specific gene or genes responsible will be difficult. Furthermore, the use of germline mutant mouse models to identify genes that control gene transfer and expression in vivo may be limited. Specifically, compensatory changes often occur in the expression of non-targeted cellular genes (45Azzouz M. Krezel W. Dolle P. Vodouhe C. Warter J.M. Poindron P. Borg J. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 46Holschneider D.P. Shih J.C. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2000; 18: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Such secondary events may confound interpretation of the “transfection-altered” phenotypes produced in mutant mice. Rather, in vivo gene transfer approaches that can assess the role of individual genes in regulating the transfection phenotype directly in adult animals will likely be required. Therefore, strategies for overcoming genetically based, inter-individual differences that limit gene transfer efficiency must be further developed, both to effectively use such in vivogene transfer approaches for functional genomic analyses, as well as for their eventual use in human gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1975530165,"Methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) is a tryptophan tryptophylquinone-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of primary amines. Native MADH exhibits a strong preference for methylamine over longer carbon chain amines. Residue αPhe55 controls this substrate specificity. When αPhe55 is replaced with Ala, this preference is reversed with αF55A MADH preferring long-chain amines with at least seven carbons (Zhu, Z., Sun, D., and Davidson, V. L. (2000)Biochemistry 39, 11184–11186). To further modulate the substrate specificity of MADH, the side-chain of αPhe55was repositioned by site-directed mutagenesis of residue βIle107. This residue makes close contact with αPhe55 and restricts its movement. βI107V MADH exhibits a strong preference for propylamine, and βI107N MADH exhibits a preference for 1-aminopentane. Thus, it has been possible to create forms of MADH that exhibit a preference for amines with carbon chain lengths of one, three, five, or seven carbons. The ability to discriminate between amines of different chain length was essentially abolished by an αF55I mutation.

The phenyl group of αPhe55 serves two functions in determining substrate specificity. It interacts with the methyl group of methylamine to help orient the amino group of the substrate for nucleophilic attack of TTQ, and it excludes long-chain amines from the active site (Fig.1). Site-directed mutagenesis was previously used to create αF55A MADH, which exhibited a dramatically altered substrate specificity in which long-chain amines are preferred to short-chain amines (6Zhu Z. Sun D. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11184-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).In this paper we further examine the extent to which the nature and position of the side-chain of residue α55 can determine the substrate specificity of MADH. In addition to directly mutating residue αPhe55, site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter the position of this residue. To reposition the phenyl side-chain of αPhe55, mutations were made of residue Ile107 of the β subunit. This residue is located adjacent to αPhe55 at the interface of the α and β subunits. From the crystal structure, it appears that the side-chain of βIle107 restricts the movement of the side-chain of αPhe55. We show that relatively conservative mutations of βIle107 significantly alter the substrate specificity of MADH. When βIle107 is converted to valine, the enzyme exhibits a strong preference for propylamine. When βIle107 is converted to asparagine, the preferred substrate is the five-carbon amylamine (1-aminopentane). Consistent with the importance of the position of the phenyl ring of αPhe55 in determining substrate specificity, conversion of αPhe55 to isoleucine yields an enzyme that exhibits no clear substrate specificity and shows relatively poor activity with amines of any carbon chain length. Thus, it has been possible to use site-directed mutagenesis to create forms of MADH that exhibit preference for amines with carbon chain lengths of one, three, five, or seven carbons; or which exhibit no preference at all. Molecular modeling studies with the known crystal structure are used to provide an explanation for these results.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNative MADH was purified from P. denitrificans as described previously (7Davidson V.L.

All reagents were purchased from Sigma or Aldrich and used without further purification.Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on double-stranded pMEG976 (8Graichen M.E. Jones L.H.

In this construct, the gene that encodes the MADH β subunit possesses a polyhistidine tag at its C terminus to facilitate purification of the expressed protein.

For each, the complementary sequence was used as the second primer for the mutagenesis. The underlined bases are those that were changed to create the desired mutation. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing 70 base pairs around the mutated site.Steady-state kinetic assays (7Davidson V.L.

The assay mixture contained 16 nm MADH, varied concentrations of substrates, 4.8 mm phenazine ethosulfate, and 170 μm2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. The reaction was monitored at 600 nm to determine the rate of reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. Data were fit to equation 1,v/E=kcat[S]/(Km+[S])Equation 1 where v is the measured initial rate, E is the MADH concentration, [S] is the substrate concentration,kcat is the turnover number, andKm is the Michaelis constant.Molecular modeling was performed using the QUANTA and CHARMm (Molecular Simulations) computer programs run on a Silicon Graphics O2 computer.

Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For αF55A MADH the preference is reversed with the enzyme preferring long-chain amines, and Km increases with decreasing length of the carbon chain (6Zhu Z. Sun D. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11184-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic analysis with a variety of amines as substrates showed that the substrate specificities of βI107V, βI107N, and αF55I MADH were each different from that of either the native MADH or αF55A MADH (Table I). Monoamines longer than amylamine (1-aminopentane) are not soluble enough in aqueous solution to achieve concentrations necessary for the kinetic studies. Primary 1,N-diamines, which are more soluble than their corresponding monoamines, were tested as substrates to examine the effect of increasing the carbon chain length beyond five. The βI107V MADH exhibits a relatively strong preference for propylamine withKm increasing as the carbon chain length is either increased or decreased. The Km value for propylamine is approximately the same as the Km value that native MADH exhibits for methylamine. The βI107N MADH exhibits a preference for 1-aminopentane with Km increasing as the carbon chain length is either increased or decreased. TheKm value for 1-aminopentane is also approximately the same as the Km value that native MADH exhibits for methylamine. The same patterns of substrate preference for these enzymes are indicated whenkcat/Km values are compared (Fig. 2) as when examining theKm values.Table ISubstrate specificities of native and mutant MADHsSubstrateNative MADHβI107V MADHβI107N MADHαF55A MADHαF55I MADHKmkcatKmkcatKmkcatKmkcatKmkcatμms−1μms−1μms−1μms−1μms−1Methylamine9 ± 130 ± 269 ± 620 ± 1250 ± 2234 ± 114900 ± 110077 ± 260 ± 82.0 ± 0.1Ethylamine19 ± 124 ± 1340 ± 596.2 ± 0.4840 ± 804.5 ± 0.29200 ± 130023 ± 1360 ± 4015 ± 1Propylamine36 ± 227 ± 16 ± 13.1 ± 0.18 ± 14.1 ± 0.21300 ± 15024 ± 1200 ± 125.2 ± 0.1Butylamine870 ± 5922 ± 188 ± 914 ± 17 ± 14.2 ± 0.1240 ± 2834 ± 1370 ± 405.4 ± 0.11-Aminopentane2500 ± 29017 ± 1130 ± 253.4 ± 0.24 ± 14.2 ± 0.247 ± 520 ± 1250 ± 215.4 ± 0.81,6-Diaminohexane720 ± 8317 ± 3170 ± 1026 ± 131 ± 316 ± 3121 ± 7343 ± 699 ± 63.4 ± 0.11,7-Diaminoheptane380 ± 4627 ± 1290 ± 4019 ± 268 ± 715 ± 17 ± 132 ± 157 ± 43.4 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2Effects of site-directed mutagenesis onkcat/Km values for different carbon chain length amines.

The molecular basis for these dramatic changes in substrate specificity that are caused by relatively conservative single site-directed mutations may be inferred from analysis of the crystal structure of MADH.Previous studies have suggested that the position of αPhe55 is important for stabilizing interactions with the methyl group of methylamine and that steric hindrance restricted entry of amines with carbon chain lengths of three or more (6Zhu Z. Sun D. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11184-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This can be seen in Fig. 1 in which a five-carbon amine has been modeled into the active site of MADH. The crystal structure of native MADH further shows that the δ1-methyl group of βIle107 points toward the center of phenyl ring of αPhe55 (Fig.3). The distance between the δ1C of βIle107 and the δ1C of αPhe55 is ∼4.0 Å. Thus, βIle107 restricts the rotation of the phenyl group of αPhe55. This methyl group is removed by the βI107V mutation. Thus, substitution of valine for isoleucine will allow limited rotation of the phenyl ring of αPhe55. One can see in Fig. 4 that a small rotation of the phenyl ring about its bond with its β-carbon could reposition this residue such that the stabilizing interaction for the C-1 carbon of the substrate amine is lost, and stabilizing van der Waals' interactions with the C-3 carbon of the substrate may occur. The specificity would decrease as the carbon chain length increases beyond three because there will be an overlap of van der Waals' radii between the longer chain substrates and βTyr119. This accounts for the strong preference of βI107V MADH for propylamine over longer and shorter amines.Figure 3Relative positions of βIle107 with αPhe55 and βTyr119. These residues are drawn as space-filling models with heteroatoms indicated by darker shading. The δ1 and γ2 carbons of βIle107, which appear to restrict the movements of the side-chains of αPhe55 and βTyr119, respectively, are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Stabilization of propylamine in the active site after repositioning of αPhe55. Propylamine has been modeled into the active site of MADH. TTQ, αPhe55, βTyr119, and the amine are drawn as space-filling models with heteroatoms indicated by darker shading. The phenyl ring of αPhe55 has been rotated about the bond with its β-carbon so that it now makes van der Waals' interactions with the C-3 of propylamine, which helps to orient it for reaction with TTQ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The δ1-methyl group of βIle107 is also removed by the βI107N mutation; however, βI107N MADH prefers amines with carbon chain lengths of five rather than three. Inspection of the crystal structure reveals that the γ2-methyl group of βIle107points toward the β-methyl group of βTyr119 (Fig. 3) and may help to orient the position of the phenol ring of βTyr119. The distance between the γ2C of βIle107 and the βC of βTyr119 is ∼4.2 Å. In βI107N MADH, this interaction is also eliminated. Therefore, the position of the phenol ring could be more flexible with less restricted rotation around the γC–βC and βC–αC bonds of βTyr119. At the same time, the amide group of asparagine has a smaller van der Waals' radius than the corresponding γ1- and δ1-methyl groups of Ile, which also gives αPhe55 more freedom of rotation. These two factors together make a more flexible gate to the active site in βI107N MADH than in native MADH. Thus, the substrate preference for βI107N MADH is also not as strict as was that of βI107V MADH. Although the five-carbon chain is preferred, propylamine and butylamine are not that much poorer substrates.Substitution of isoleucine for αPhe55 essentially eliminates the substrate specificity of MADH, converting it to an enzyme that is a relatively poor catalyst for the oxidative deamination of primary amines without regard for their carbon chain length. The most likely explanation for this is that the Ile side-chain is free to rotate about several carbon–carbon bonds and cannot be placed into a rigid conformation like that of αPhe55 in the native enzyme. As such, there is less restriction of long-chain amines but also less specific stabilization of short-chain amines.It is difficult to analyze these data in terms of a quantitative comparative binding analysis because these are steady-stateKm values and not true association constants. Some qualitative comments, however, are in order. It is noteworthy that theKm values for the most preferred substrate for the native, βI107V, βI107N, and αF55A MADHs are approximately the same. For the reaction of native MADH with methylamine, theKd value of 13 μm that was obtained from transient kinetic studies (11Brooks H.B. Jones L.H. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) is similar to the steady-stateKm value (Table I). If we regard the relative values of ln(1/Km) as an indication of the relative values of ΔG°, this therefore suggests that the sum of the binding energies that stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex are approximately the same for each mutant with its preferred substrate. This means that these mutations need not have changed the mechanism or nature of the interactions that stabilize substrate binding. They have simply changed the position at which the stabilizing interactions occur on substrates of different carbon chain lengths. This is consistent with our earlier discussion.There are two main factors affecting substrate preference of MADH. One is the ability of αPhe55 and βTyr119 to stabilize the binding of the amine substrate and orient its amino group for nucleophilic attack of TTQ. The other function of αPhe55 and βTyr119 is to exclude long-chain amines from the active site due to steric hindrance. These facts have been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis and exploited to specifically alter the substrate preference of MADH. Single site-directed mutations of residues αPhe55 and βIle107 of MADH significantly change the substrate specificity of this enzyme. The results show that MADH can be changed from an enzyme with a strong preference for methylamine to enzymes that prefer amines with carbon chain lengths of three (βI107V), five (βI107N), or seven or more (αF55A). A single mutation was also used to render MADH unable to discriminate between amines with varying length carbon chains (αF55I).From a protein engineering perspective, it is desirable to develop simple approaches for altering substrate specificity of enzymes without causing major structural changes that could otherwise affect the function or stability of the enzyme, or both. There are relatively few examples of the use of site-directed mutagenesis to rationally redesign substrate specificity. In most cases, multiple changes are required. For example, the substrate preference of aspartate aminotransferase was altered using homology modeling to prefer tyrosine (12Onuffer J.J. Kirsch J.F. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1750-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and using directed evolution to prefer branched-chain amino acids (13Yano T. Oue S. Kagamiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5511-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, in each case it was necessary to change at least six amino acid residues to alter the substrate specificity. Trypsin has been converted to chymotrypsin by replacing two surface loops containing 13 amino acids (14Hedstrom L. Szilagyi L. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 255: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). It has been possible to alter substrate specificity by single amino acid substitutions. Examples of this include isocitrate dehydrogenase (15Doyle S.A. Fung S-Y.F. Koshland D.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14348-14355Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and glutathione reductase (16Stoll V.S. Simpson S.J. Krauth-Siegel L. Walsh C.T. Pai E.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results showed that interactions between neighboring residues in the active site may strongly influence each other. In the latter case, it was shown that an A34E mutation caused a significant movement of Arg347 due to steric hindrance, which in turn altered substrate specificity. We report here how it was possible to use a rational approach to redesign substrate specificity by using site-directed mutagenesis of a single amino acid residue to reposition another critical residue in the active site. The demonstration with MADH that the specificity of the enzyme may be modulated over a wide range of substrates, in a predictable manner, by single mutations suggests that such an approach may be applicable to other enzymes. Methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH)1 (EC 1.4.99.3) fromParacoccus denitrificans is a soluble bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of methylamine to formaldehyde plus ammonia (1Davidson V.L.

When βIle107 is converted to asparagine, the preferred substrate is the five-carbon amylamine (1-aminopentane). Consistent with the importance of the position of the phenyl ring of αPhe55 in determining substrate specificity, conversion of αPhe55 to isoleucine yields an enzyme that exhibits no clear substrate specificity and shows relatively poor activity with amines of any carbon chain length. Thus, it has been possible to use site-directed mutagenesis to create forms of MADH that exhibit preference for amines with carbon chain lengths of one, three, five, or seven carbons; or which exhibit no preference at all. Molecular modeling studies with the known crystal structure are used to provide an explanation for these results.

In this construct, the gene that encodes the MADH β subunit possesses a polyhistidine tag at its C terminus to facilitate purification of the expressed protein. The primers used to create the site-directed mutations were: βI107V, 5′-CAACGACATCGTCTGGTGCTTCGGCGCCGAGG-3′; βI107N, 5′-CAACGACATCAACTGGTGCTTCGGCGCCGAGG-3′; αF55I, 5′-GTCAACGACCCGGCGCATATCGCCGCGGTCACCCAGCAATTCG-3′. For each, the complementary sequence was used as the second primer for the mutagenesis. The underlined bases are those that were changed to create the desired mutation. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing 70 base pairs around the mutated site.Steady-state kinetic assays (7Davidson V.L.

The assay mixture contained 16 nm MADH, varied concentrations of substrates, 4.8 mm phenazine ethosulfate, and 170 μm2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. The reaction was monitored at 600 nm to determine the rate of reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol.

Immunodeficiency is a feature of A-T, with defects in cellular and humoral immunity (2Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The gene responsible for A-T, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (atm), is a large complicated gene that includes 66 exons and encodes a 350-kDa protein. The A-T locus has been mapped to chromosome 11, region q22–23 (3Gatti R.A. Berkel I. Boder E. Braedt G. Charmley P. Concannon P. Ersoy F. Foroud T. Jaspers N.G. Lange K.

Other members of the family of atm-related genes include the yeast proteins Rad3, Mec1, and Tel1, the Tor proteins and their mammalian counterpart FRAP, which are involved in DNA repair and metabolism and cell cycle checkpoint control (for review, see Ref. 6Zakian V.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 685-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These sequence similarities and the high rate of spontaneous intrachromosomal recombination seen in A-T (7Meyn M.S.

Their data showed that this defect manifests in several ways: (i) lack of a proliferative response as measured by thymidine incorporation; (ii) reduced intracellular Ca2+mobilization; (iii) reduced activation of phospholipase lipase Cγ1; (iv) lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of the Src-related kinase Lyn, expressed in B cells; and (v) lack of PI 3-kinase activation. These workers used wild-type Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to immortalize B cells and generate LCLs. Consequently it would be anticipated that any defects in cell signaling which are a usual consequence of the presence of wild-type EBV would be manifest in this system. Previous reports show that EBV can block signaling through the B cell receptor in LCLs (8Fruehling S. Lee S.K. Herrold R. Frech B. Laux G. Kremmer E. Grasser F.A. Longnecker R. J.

This block is mediated by the interaction of tyrosine residues in the EBV-encoded LMP2A amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail with intracellular signaling molecules, including Lyn and Syk (8Fruehling S.

LCLs bearing LMP2A-deleted EBV transduce signals in a manner indistinguishable from that observed in the EBV-negative B cell line BJAB (12Miller C.L. Longnecker R. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3087-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Miller C.L. Lee J.H. Kieff E. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Longnecker R. Infect. Agents Dis. 1994; 3: 128-136PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, LCLs derived from healthy adults using wild-type EBV show a complete blockade of signaling, resembling the result Khanna and colleagues (1Khanna K.K. Yan J. Watters D. Hobson K. Beamish H. Spring K. Shiloh Y. Gatti R.A. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9489-9495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported with A-T LCLs bearing wild-type EBV. This suggests that the lack of cell signaling in A-T cells was caused by the action of LMP2A encoded by the wild-type EBV used to immortalize the A-T B cells, rather than an intrinsic fault in A-T B cells. Further, the mode of action of ATM, product of the gene deficient in A-T, has not been reported as directly possessing a role in B cell signaling. Therefore to test the hypothesis that the observed fault in A-T B cells derived from wild-type EBV, we derived LCLs from A-T patients and healthy controls using either wild-type or LMP2A-deleted EBV. We investigated transmembrane signaling events after anti-Ig treatment in each type of LCL and report that intracellular calcium mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation in LMP2A-deleted LCLs derived from A-T patients are indistinguishable from those in LMP2A-deleted LCLs derived from normal patients. Further, signaling is blocked similarly in A-T and normal lymphoblastoid cells infected with wild-type EBV. We conclude that there is no evidence of a fault in signal transduction through the B cell antigen receptor in A-T B cells. A-T patients were diagnosed according to the multiple element criteria set as described previously (14Crawford T.O. Mandir A.S. Lefton-Greif M.A. Goodman S.N. Goodman B.K. Sengul H. Lederman H.M. Neurology. 2000; 54: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 10 ml of peripheral blood was collected into heparinized containers from nine A-T patients and from six healthy controls. Mononuclear cells were purified by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and derivation of LCLs with virus EBfaV-GFP was carried out as described (15Speck P. Kline K.A. Cheresh P. Longnecker R. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2193-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Stocks of this virus contain a mixture of wild-type (strain B95-8) and mutant virus, in which the EcoRI-SalI region of EBV gene LMP2A (B95-8 sequence locations 2–644) is replaced by a DNA cassette obtained from plasmid pEGFP.N1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) and which encodes neomycin resistance and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). 50 μg/ml cyclosporin A was used to enhance the yield of immortalized B cell lines arising from the infection by suppressing the action of donor T cells directed against EBV (16Okano M. Taguchi Y. Nakamine H. Pirruccello S.J. Davis J.R. Beisel K.W. Kleveland K.L. Sanger W.G. Fordyce R.R. Purtilo D.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 517-522PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chang R.S. Lung M.L. J. Virol. Methods. 1994; 46: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Infected mononuclear cells were incubated in 96-well plates at 50,000 cells/well with half of the medium changed each week until proliferating colonies of cells were macroscopically evident, typically 3–5 weeks after infection. LCLs were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. Resulting LCLs were evaluated for the genotype of the EBV genome they contained (wild-type or EGFP+, LMP2A-deleted) by visualization of EGFP expression as described (18Speck P. Longnecker R. Arch. Virol. 1999; 144: 1123-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and by PCR. DNA samples were extracted from LCLs as described (19Wang F. Marchini A. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1701-1709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers specific for LMP2A sequences were as described (15Speck P. Kline K.A. Cheresh P. Longnecker R. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2193-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and a standard protocol for PCR was employed (20Vahey M.T. Wong M.T. Michael N.L. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 17-22Google Scholar). Changes in intracellular calcium concentration were measured as described by Miller et al. (21Miller C.L. Lee J.H. Kieff E. Longnecker R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 772-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded with the ratiometric calcium-binding fluorescent dye indo-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature according to the protocol of Rabinovitch et al. (22Rabinovitch P.S. June C.H. Grossmann A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 952-961PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then examined using a Beckman Coulter Elite ESP flow cytometer using Elite version 4.02 software. This instrument reads fluorescence at 395 and 525 nm and calculates the ratio of these readings, which changes with calcium flux in the cell. Stimulation of cells was by introducing goat anti-human immunoglobulin (IgM+IgG+IgA, H+L, Southern Biotechnologies, Birmingham, AL) to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml in the cell suspension. For the phosphotyrosine blot, because visualization of tyrosine phosphorylation is clearer with immunoprecipitates than whole lysates, samples were immunoprecipitated. Cells were treated with goat anti-human immunoglobulin for the indicated times and lysed as described by Fruehling et al. (11Fruehling S. Swart R. Dolwick K.M. Kremmer E. Longnecker R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7796-7806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were immunoprecipitated as described (11Fruehling S. Swart R. Dolwick K.M. Kremmer E. Longnecker R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7796-7806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20, obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and separated using 8% SDS-PAGE. Transferred protein was blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20 directly conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For the ATM blot, whole cell lysates were separated on 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blotted with mouse anti-ATM (a generous gift from Dr. Y. Shiloh) at 1:1,000 followed by anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase at 1:2,000. For the PI3-kinase blot, whole cell lysates were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a membrane that was blotted with rabbit anti-PI3-kinase (1:4,000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Happauge, NY) followed by anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at 1:2,000. Visualization of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary reagents employed enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce). Flow cytometry was carried out using a FacsCalibur® (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) as described (15Speck P. Kline K.A. Cheresh P. Longnecker R. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2193-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Speck P. Longnecker R. Arch. Virol. 1999; 144: 1123-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immuno Research (West Grove, PA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from A-T patients and normal donors were infected with EBfaV-GFP (15Speck P. Kline K.A. Cheresh P. Longnecker R. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2193-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the resulting LCLs were screened by EGFP expression and PCR to evaluate the EBV genotype contained. Cells from nine A-T patients were infected with virus EBfaV-GFP and cultured in 96-well plates. Although virus EBfaV-GFP encodes a gene for resistance to the cytotoxic drug G418, drug selection was not applied. LCLs grew from seven of the nine patients, yielding a total of 320 lines. These results are similar to results from normal donors when equal numbers of cells were infected (data not shown). Examination of these lines by fluorescence showed that >95% of the cell lines expressed EGFP. DNA samples from each of these cell lines were examined by PCR, with primers specific for LMP2A which yield a reaction product of 546 bp as described previously (15Speck P. Kline K.A. Cheresh P. Longnecker R. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2193-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). LCLs bearing only recombinant LMP2A-deleted EBV were isolated from cells obtained from three of the patients. Fig.1 shows examples of PCR results obtained from these lines. As an internal control on integrity of the PCR, primers specific for EBV gene BHRF1 and which yield a 239-bp DNA product were included in each reaction. The sensitivity of this PCR to detect EBV LMP2A sequences has been determined previously (15Speck P. Kline K.A. Cheresh P. Longnecker R. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2193-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and is such that a single wild-type EBV genome is detected readily in a background of 10–100 mutant genomes. To confirm the A-T genotype of LCLs derived from A-T patients, Western blotting was performed to examine the expression of ATM, product of the gene mutated in this disorder (Fig. 2). A monoclonal antibody directed against ATM bound to a band of the appropriate size for each of three LCLs derived from healthy controls (Fig. 2A, LCL1, LCL3, and ES.1). In lysates from A-T LCLs, no band was bound by the ATM antibody (Fig. 2B, V4.1, V4.3, and AZ4.1). Overloading of the gel and overexposure of the horseradish peroxidase-treated blots failed to reveal a band (data not shown). Lack of expression of ATM in the A-T patient LCLs is consistent with the clinical diagnoses and demonstrates the A-T lesion at a molecular level. To confirm protein loading for each sample, the blot was stripped and reprobed with antibodies against PI3-kinase, demonstrating that the absence of reactivity with the ATM protein was not the result of the absence of reactive protein in each lane (Fig. 2B, LCL1, LCL3, ES.1, V4.1, V4.3, and AZ4.1).Figure 2Confirmation of genotype of A-Tdiagnosis. Panel A, to confirm the A-T genotype of LCLs derived from A-T patients, Western blotting was performed to examine the expression of atm, the gene mutated in this disorder. A monoclonal antibody (obtained from Y. Shiloh) directed againstatm and used at 1:1,000 followed by anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at 1:2,000 followed by chemiluminescence, bound to a band of the appropriate size (about 350 kDa; location of the largest size marker (220 kDa) is as shown) for each of three LCLs derived from healthy controls (LCL1, LCL3, ES.1). In lysates from A-T LCLs (V4.1, V4.3, AZ4.1), no band was bound by the atm antibody. Overloading of the gel and overexposure of the horseradish peroxidase-treated blots failed to reveal a band (data not shown). Lack of expression of atm in the A-T patient LCLs is consistent with the diagnosis and demonstrates the A-T lesion at a molecular level. Panel B, as a check to show that similar amounts of protein were loaded into each well, the membrane was stripped and probed for the presence of PI3-kinase. The membrane was blotted with rabbit anti-PI3-kinase at 1:4,000, which was detected using anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at 1:2,000 followed by chemiluminescence. The PI3-kinase band is at predicted size of 85 kDa; molecular mass markers are at 97 and 66 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether differences in intracellular signaling could result from altered expression of sIg on cells, expression levels of sIg on normal and A-T cells, bearing either wild-type or LMP2A-deleted EBV, were measured. Expression levels were assessed by flow cytometry using a Southern Biotechnology goat antibody directed against human immunoglobulin, which was detected using a Cy3-labeled secondary antibody. Examples of flow cytometry plots showing sIg levels are shown in Fig. 3, with panel 1 showing the expression level of sIg on A-T cells bearing wild-type EBV and panel 2 showing an LCL derived from a healthy control and bearing wild-type EBV. These expression levels were indistinguishable from one another. All LCLs used in this study, regardless of origin (healthy control or A-T patient) or EBV genotype (wild-type or LMP2A-depleted) were examined for sIg expression and showed sIg levels indistinguishable from those displayed in Fig. 3 (data not shown). This result agrees with the observations of Khanna et al. (1Khanna K.K. Yan J. Watters D. Hobson K. Beamish H. Spring K. Shiloh Y. Gatti R.A. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9489-9495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It was concluded that sIg levels do not account for any measured differences in intracellular signaling among any of the cell lines examined. Intracellular signaling in response to antibody stimulation of the B cell receptor was measured using the ratiometric fluorescent dye indo-1. The cell lines examined included six lines derived from three A-T patients which by PCR had been shown to carry LMP2A-deleted EBV only; four cell lines derived from A-T patients which by PCR had been shown to carry wild-type EBV only; and LCLs derived from healthy controls, and which likewise carried either wild-type or mutant LMP2A-deleted EBV. As shown in Fig. 4, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was similarly blocked for control LCLs bearing wild-type EBV (Fig. 4, panels 1 and 2) and A-T LCLs bearing wild-type EBV (Fig. 4, panel 5). LCLs bearing LMP2A-deleted EBV yielded similar changes in intracellular Ca2+, regardless of whether derived from controls (Fig. 4,panels 3 and 4) or A-T cells (Fig. 4,panels 6–9). The responses shown in Fig. 4, panels 5 and 6, were obtained from cell lines derived from the same patient and differed only in the LMP2A status of the immortalizing EBV. Using Elite version 4.02 software as supplied with the Beckman Coulter Elite ESP flow cytometer, the proportion of cells responding to stimulation was quantified. Table I lists the calcium response phenotype of LCLs tested. Ca2+ flux in A-T cells occurs indistinguishably from that in normal cells. In wild-type and A-T EBV LCLs, <0.5% of cells show a measurable response to anti-Ig. In contrast, in LMP2A-deleted A-T LCLs, between 31.5 and 61.2% of cells responded. In LMP2A-deleted normal LCLs, this range spanned 29.3–42.6%. We conclude that the calcium responses of A-T LMP2A-deleted LCLs fall within the same range as that of LMP2A-deleted normal LCLs. Comparisons among cell lines derived from the same patient and differing in the LMP2A genotype of transforming virus demonstrate the role that LMP2A is playing in blockage of signaling. For example, KS1.1 and KS1.2 cells, which contain wild-type EBV, do not display calcium signaling in response to sIg cross-linking. In contrast, KS1.7 and KS1.11 cells, derived from the same patient and bearing LMP2A-deleted EBV, display calcium fluxes resembling that of normal controls bearing the same virus. Taken together, these data suggests to us that any apparent lack of signaling in A-T LCLs is the result only of the previously described LMP2A effect of blocking normal B cell signal transduction (8Fruehling S.

It was concluded that the calcium responses of A-T LMP2A-deleted LCLs fall within the same range as that of LMP2A-deleted normal LCLs. Because phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a prerequisite for the mobilization of intracellular calcium stores we compared the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to stimulation of sIg in A-T LCLs with that in normal LCLs. As shown in Fig. 5, induction of tyrosine phosphorylation was not observed in LCLs (Fig. 5, LCL1 and LCL3) infected with wild-type EBV. In contrast, induction of phosphotyrosine in response to sIg cross-linking was observed readily in control lines bearing LMP2A-deleted EBV (Fig. 5, ES.1) and in A-T lines bearing LMP2A-deleted EBV (Fig. 5, AZ4.1). A-T cell line AZ4.1 is shown because of the prominence of the tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells. Other A-T LMP2A-deleted LCLs displayed tyrosine phosphorylation similar to the LMP2A-deleted EBV-transformed cell line shown in Fig. 5 indicating that, like LMP2A-deleted from normal individuals, A-T LMP2A-deleted LCLs also show a range of responses (data not shown). We conclude that phosphotyrosine induction in A-T cells occurs in the same manner and to the same extent as it does in normal cells after B cell receptor activation. The product of the ATM gene has multiple functions involving maintaining stability of the genome and signal transduction, and faults within it compromise the immune system. Recent studies suggest that ATM is activated primarily in response to double-strand DNA breaks, the major cytotoxic lesion caused by ionizing radiation, and can directly bind to and phosphorylate c-Abl, p53, and replication protein A (for review, see Ref. 23Khanna K.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The ATM protein is required for phosphorylation of the breast cancer susceptibility gene Brca1 in response to ionizing radiation (24Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Like many aspects of the disorder, the immune deficiency in A-T is pleiotropic in nature, involving multiple aspects of the immune system. In many patients, the thymus is hypoplastic, and numbers of total T cells are reduced. The humoral immune system shows variable deficiency in A-T with whole or partial deficiencies of IgA, IgE, IgG, IgG subclasses and IgM, as well as oligoclonal gammapathy (for review, see Ref. 2Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The proportion of total B cells in the peripheral blood of A-T patients is usually normal or elevated (25Waldmann T.A. McIntire K.R. Lancet. 1972; 2: 1112-1115Abstract PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A reduction of T cell helper activity has been reported in some patients with A-T (25Waldmann T.A. McIntire K.R. Lancet. 1972; 2: 1112-1115Abstract PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), but this may be insufficient to account for the Ig absence. One interpretation of these data is that in A-T patients, B cells have a defect in maturation to Ig-producing cells or that the defect relates to abnormal signal transduction after activation (2Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Another explanation is provided by the chromosomal instability in A-T which particularly involves chromosomes 7 and 14 in the vicinity of the T cell receptor and Ig genes (for review, see Ref. 2Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The humoral immune deficiency in A-T along with the potential importance of the ATM gene product in cell signaling prompted Khanna and colleagues (1Khanna K.K. Yan J. Watters D. Hobson K. Beamish H. Spring K. Shiloh Y. Gatti R.A. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9489-9495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to consider the hypothesis that B cell signaling is intrinsically defective in A-T. In examining B cell signaling in A-T B cells, Khanna and colleagues studied multiple aspects of B cell signaling: cellular proliferation, calcium mobilization, activation of phospholipase Cγ1, tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of PI 3-kinase. Each of these aspects of B cell signaling is a known consequence of cross-linking of B cell sIg. Khanna and colleagues, as we did in the current study, used LCLs generated by EBV infection from A-T patients as well as normal control LCLs with one important difference. In our current study, we used an EBV recombinant virus deleted for LMP2A to generate our LCLs for subsequent signaling analysis. We, as well as others, have shown that LMP2A expressed by single gene transfer into EBV-negative B lymphoma cells or expressed in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes is able to block normal sIg-mediated signal transduction efficiently after sIg cross-linking (8Fruehling S.

We have made specific point mutations within LMP2A delineating the interaction of LMP2A with the Src family PTKs and the Syk PTK as essential for the ability of LMP2A to block B cell sIg signal transduction (8Fruehling S.

Furthermore, this function of LMP2A in EBV-infected LCLs has prompted the use of LMP2A-deleted EBV to study signal transduction in LCLs generated from patients with mutations in Btk (32Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In the Khanna study, the A-T LCLs generated with wild-type EBV have a phenotype that is entirely expected based on our studies and others illustrating the dramatic effect LMP2A has on normal B cell signal transduction (8Fruehling S.

This observation is the result of the presence of LMP2A and not mutation of the ATM gene. What is more difficult to reconcile in the Khanna study is the results with the wild-type EBV-transformed LCLs from normal donors which responded well for a number of cell signaling parameters after sIg cross-linking. Based on our previous studies, we would have expected these control cells to be unresponsive after sIg cross-linking as was observed for the A-T patient LCLs transformed with wild-type EBV. In using the LMP2A-deleted EBV-transformed LCLs, we observed no difference in calcium mobilization or tyrosine phosphorylation after sIg cross-linking in A-T patient or control lines, indicating that signaling was similar. In view of the interrelated nature of the signaling parameters examined by Khanna et al. and the established effect of LMP2 on signaling, it is not necessary for this study to examine each and every parameter addressed by Khannaet al. to show that signaling is normal in A-T B cells. We do not have an explanation of why Khanna and colleagues observed immunoglobulin-mediated signaling in control wild-type transformed LCLs. Despite this discrepancy between their studies and ours, the most important conclusion in our current study is that calcium mobilization and the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation are not defective in A-T patient LCLs as reported previously in the Khanna study. The results of studies of ATM−/− mice are consistent with the results of this study. ATM−/− mice are defective in their T-dependent antibody responses but normal in T-independent antibody responses. B cells derived from ATM−/− mice proliferate normally in response to stimuli including anti-IgM, lipopolysaccharide, and CD40 ligand (33Xu Y. Ashley T. Brainerd E.E. Bronson R.T. Meyn M.S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), suggesting that mouse ATM−/− B cells are functionally normal. Consequently, it is concluded that signaling through the B cell receptor in A-T cells is indistinguishable from that of normal B cells. We thank the people in the laboratories of Dr. R.
