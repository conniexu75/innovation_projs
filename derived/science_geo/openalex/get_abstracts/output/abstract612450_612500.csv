https://openalex.org/W2806820493,"Here, we report that genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 induces a p53-mediated DNA damage response and cell cycle arrest in immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells, leading to a selection against cells with a functional p53 pathway. Inhibition of p53 prevents the damage response and increases the rate of homologous recombination from a donor template. These results suggest that p53 inhibition may improve the efficiency of genome editing of untransformed cells and that p53 function should be monitored when developing cell-based therapies utilizing CRISPR-Cas9."
https://openalex.org/W2807198924,"CRISPR/Cas9 has revolutionized our ability to engineer genomes and conduct genome-wide screens in human cells1-3. Whereas some cell types are amenable to genome engineering, genomes of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been difficult to engineer, with reduced efficiencies relative to tumour cell lines or mouse embryonic stem cells3-13. Here, using hPSC lines with stable integration of Cas9 or transient delivery of Cas9-ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), we achieved an average insertion or deletion (indel) efficiency greater than 80%. This high efficiency of indel generation revealed that double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by Cas9 are toxic and kill most hPSCs. In previous studies, the toxicity of Cas9 in hPSCs was less apparent because of low transfection efficiency and subsequently low DSB induction3. The toxic response to DSBs was P53/TP53-dependent, such that the efficiency of precise genome engineering in hPSCs with a wild-type P53 gene was severely reduced. Our results indicate that Cas9 toxicity creates an obstacle to the high-throughput use of CRISPR/Cas9 for genome engineering and screening in hPSCs. Moreover, as hPSCs can acquire P53 mutations14, cell replacement therapies using CRISPR/Cas9-enginereed hPSCs should proceed with caution, and such engineered hPSCs should be monitored for P53 function."

However, it remains unknown whether T cells in human cancer adopt a similar spectrum of exhausted states based on PD-1 expression levels. We compared transcriptional, metabolic and functional signatures of intratumoral CD8+ T lymphocyte populations with high (PD-1T), intermediate (PD-1N) and no PD-1 expression (PD-1–) from non-small-cell lung cancer patients. PD-1T T cells showed a markedly different transcriptional and metabolic profile from PD-1N and PD-1– lymphocytes, as well as an intrinsically high capacity for tumor recognition. Furthermore, while PD-1T lymphocytes were impaired in classical effector cytokine production, they produced CXCL13, which mediates immune cell recruitment to tertiary lymphoid structures. Strikingly, the presence of PD-1T cells was strongly predictive for both response and survival in a small cohort of non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with PD-1 blockade. The characterization of a distinct state of tumor-reactive, PD-1-bright lymphocytes in human cancer, which only partially resembles that seen in chronic infection, provides potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells with high expression of PD-1 in non-small-cell lung cancer are distinct from exhausted T cells in chronic virus infection, have high tumor reactivity and associate with response to PD-1-targeted immunotherapy."

Development of agents that could inhibit the formation of A1 reactive astrocytes could be used to treat these diseases for which there are no disease-modifying therapies. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists have been indicated as potential neuroprotective agents for neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease3-13. The mechanisms by which GLP1R agonists are neuroprotective are not known. Here we show that a potent, brain-penetrant long-acting GLP1R agonist, NLY01, protects against the loss of dopaminergic neurons and behavioral deficits in the α-synuclein preformed fibril (α-syn PFF) mouse model of sporadic Parkinson's disease14,15. NLY01 also prolongs the life and reduces the behavioral deficits and neuropathological abnormalities in the human A53T α-synuclein (hA53T) transgenic mouse model of α-synucleinopathy-induced neurodegeneration16. We found that NLY01 is a potent GLP1R agonist with favorable properties that is neuroprotective through the direct prevention of microglial-mediated conversion of astrocytes to an A1 neurotoxic phenotype. In light of its favorable properties, NLY01 should be evaluated in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and related neurologic disorders characterized by microglial activation."

We meta-analyzed genotype data from a custom high-density array of 46,939 PrCa cases and 27,910 controls of European ancestry with previously genotyped data of 32,255 PrCa cases and 33,202 controls of European ancestry. Our analysis identified 62 novel loci associated (P < 5.0 × 10−8) with PrCa and one locus significantly associated with early-onset PrCa (≤55 years). Our findings include missense variants rs1800057 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.16; P = 8.2 × 10−9; G>C, p.Pro1054Arg) in ATM and rs2066827 (OR = 1.06; P = 2.3 × 10−9; T>G, p.Val109Gly) in CDKN1B. The combination of all loci captured 28.4% of the PrCa familial relative risk, and a polygenic risk score conferred an elevated PrCa risk for men in the ninetieth to ninety-ninth percentiles (relative risk = 2.69; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.55–2.82) and first percentile (relative risk = 5.71; 95% CI: 5.04–6.48) risk stratum compared with the population average. These findings improve risk prediction, enhance fine-mapping, and provide insight into the underlying biology of PrCa1. A large meta-analysis combining genome-wide and custom high-density genotyping array data identifies 63 new susceptibility loci for prostate cancer, enhancing fine-mapping efforts and providing insights into the underlying biology."
https://openalex.org/W2806128074,"Metabolic reprograming is an emerging hallmark of tumor biology and an actively pursued opportunity in discovery of oncology drugs. Extensive efforts have focused on therapeutic targeting of glycolysis, whereas drugging mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) has remained largely unexplored, partly owing to an incomplete understanding of tumor contexts in which OXPHOS is essential. Here, we report the discovery of IACS-010759, a clinical-grade small-molecule inhibitor of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Treatment with IACS-010759 robustly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in models of brain cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) reliant on OXPHOS, likely owing to a combination of energy depletion and reduced aspartate production that leads to impaired nucleotide biosynthesis. In models of brain cancer and AML, tumor growth was potently inhibited in vivo following IACS-010759 treatment at well-tolerated doses. IACS-010759 is currently being evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials in relapsed/refractory AML and solid tumors. A new inhibitor targeting the mitochondrial complex I shows antitumor activity in preclinical models of acute myeloid leukemia and glioblastoma relying on oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2805322110,"Paradigm-shifting studies in the mouse have identified tissue macrophage heterogeneity as a critical determinant of immune responses. In contrast, surprisingly little is known regarding macrophage heterogeneity in humans. Macrophages within the mouse heart are partitioned into CCR2− and CCR2+ subsets with divergent origins, repopulation mechanisms, and functions. Here, we demonstrate that the human myocardium also contains distinct subsets of CCR2− and CCR2+ macrophages. Analysis of sex-mismatched heart transplant recipients revealed that CCR2− macrophages are a tissue-resident population exclusively replenished through local proliferation, whereas CCR2+ macrophages are maintained through monocyte recruitment and proliferation. Moreover, CCR2− and CCR2+ macrophages have distinct functional properties, analogous to reparative CCR2− and inflammatory CCR2+ macrophages in the mouse heart. Clinically, CCR2+ macrophage abundance is associated with left ventricular remodeling and systolic function in heart failure patients. Collectively, these observations provide initial evidence for the functional importance of macrophage heterogeneity in the human heart. Study of macrophage heterogeneity in human hearts reveals a subset of inflammatory macrophages that is associated with cardiac dysfunction in patients with heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2806672448,"Heterobifunctional small-molecule degraders that induce protein degradation through ligase-mediated ubiquitination have shown considerable promise as a new pharmacological modality. However, we currently lack a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for target recruitment and selectivity, which is critically required to enable rational design of degraders. Here we utilize a comprehensive characterization of the ligand-dependent CRBN-BRD4 interaction to demonstrate that binding between proteins that have not evolved to interact is plastic. Multiple X-ray crystal structures show that plasticity results in several distinct low-energy binding conformations that are selectively bound by ligands. We demonstrate that computational protein-protein docking can reveal the underlying interprotein contacts and inform the design of a BRD4 selective degrader that can discriminate between highly homologous BET bromodomains. Our findings that plastic interprotein contacts confer selectivity for ligand-induced protein dimerization provide a conceptual framework for the development of heterobifunctional ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2806597619,"The brain microenvironment imposes a particularly intense selective pressure on metastasis-initiating cells, but successful metastases bypass this control through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Reactive astrocytes are key components of this microenvironment that confine brain metastasis without infiltrating the lesion. Here, we describe that brain metastatic cells induce and maintain the co-option of a pro-metastatic program driven by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in a subpopulation of reactive astrocytes surrounding metastatic lesions. These reactive astrocytes benefit metastatic cells by their modulatory effect on the innate and acquired immune system. In patients, active STAT3 in reactive astrocytes correlates with reduced survival from diagnosis of intracranial metastases. Blocking STAT3 signaling in reactive astrocytes reduces experimental brain metastasis from different primary tumor sources, even at advanced stages of colonization. We also show that a safe and orally bioavailable treatment that inhibits STAT3 exhibits significant antitumor effects in patients with advanced systemic disease that included brain metastasis. Responses to this therapy were notable in the central nervous system, where several complete responses were achieved. Given that brain metastasis causes substantial morbidity and mortality, our results identify a novel treatment for increasing survival in patients with secondary brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2807106468,"Antiretroviral therapy during the earliest stage of acute HIV infection (Fiebig I) might minimize establishment of a latent HIV reservoir and thereby facilitate viremic control after analytical treatment interruption. We show that 8 participants, who initiated treatment during Fiebig I and were treated for a median of 2.8 years, all experienced rapid viral load rebound following analytical treatment interruption, indicating that additional strategies are required to control or eradicate HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2808620382,"The potential of exosomes as biomarker resources for diagnostics, prognostics and even for therapeutics is an area of intense research. Despite the various approaches available, there is no consensus with respect to the best methodology for isolating exosomes and to provide substantial yields with reliable quality. Differential centrifugation is the most commonly used method but it is time-consuming and requires large sample volumes, thus alternative methods are urgently needed. In this study two precipitation-based methods and one column-based approach were compared for exosome isolation from distinct biofluids (serum, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid). Exosome characterization included morphological analyses, determination of particle concentration, stability and exosome preparations' purity, using different complementary approaches such as Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, Electrophoretic Light Scattering, Transmission Electron Microscopy, EXOCET colorimetric assay, protein quantification methods and western blotting. The three commercial kits tested successfully isolated exosomes from the biofluids under study, although ExoS showed the best performance in terms of exosome yield and purity. Data shows that methods other than differential centrifugation can be applied to quickly and efficiently isolate exosomes from reduced biofluid volumes. The possibility to use small volumes is fundamental in the context of translational and clinical research, thus the results here presented contribute significantly in this respect."
https://openalex.org/W2805849705,"Optical frequency combs, which emit pulses of light at discrete, equally spaced frequencies, are cornerstones of modern-day frequency metrology, precision spectroscopy, astronomical observations, ultrafast optics and quantum information1–7. Chip-scale frequency combs, based on the Kerr and Raman nonlinearities in monolithic microresonators with ultrahigh quality factors8–10, have recently led to progress in optical clockwork and observations of temporal cavity solitons11–14. But the chromatic dispersion within a laser cavity, which determines the comb formation15,16, is usually difficult to tune with an electric field, whether in microcavities or fibre cavities. Such electrically dynamic control could bridge optical frequency combs and optoelectronics, enabling diverse comb outputs in one resonator with fast and convenient tunability. Arising from its exceptional Fermi–Dirac tunability and ultrafast carrier mobility17–19, graphene has a complex optical dispersion determined by its optical conductivity, which can be tuned through a gate voltage20,21. This has brought about optoelectronic advances such as modulators22,23, photodetectors 24 and controllable plasmonics25,26. Here we demonstrate the gated intracavity tunability of graphene-based optical frequency combs, by coupling the gate-tunable optical conductivity to a silicon nitride photonic microresonator, thus modulating its second- and higher-order chromatic dispersions by altering the Fermi level. Preserving cavity quality factors up to 106 in the graphene-based comb, we implement a dual-layer ion-gel-gated transistor to tune the Fermi level of graphene across the range 0.45–0.65 electronvolts, under single-volt-level control. We use this to produce charge-tunable primary comb lines from 2.3 terahertz to 7.2 terahertz, coherent Kerr frequency combs, controllable Cherenkov radiation and controllable soliton states, all in a single microcavity. We further demonstrate voltage-tunable transitions from periodic soliton crystals to crystals with defects, mapped by our ultrafast second-harmonic optical autocorrelation. This heterogeneous graphene microcavity, which combines single-atomic-layer nanoscience and ultrafast optoelectronics, will help to improve our understanding of dynamical frequency combs and ultrafast optics. Coupling graphene sheets with a silicon nitride ring microresonator allows the nonlinear cavity dynamics to be altered by a gate voltage, resulting in tunable, chip-scale, optical frequency combs."
https://openalex.org/W2806513202,"Detyrosinated microtubules provide mechanical resistance that can impede the motion of contracting cardiomyocytes. However, the functional effects of microtubule detyrosination in heart failure or in human hearts have not previously been studied. Here, we utilize mass spectrometry and single-myocyte mechanical assays to characterize changes to the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and their functional consequences in human heart failure. Proteomic analysis of left ventricle tissue reveals a consistent upregulation and stabilization of intermediate filaments and microtubules in failing human hearts. As revealed by super-resolution imaging, failing cardiomyocytes are characterized by a dense, heavily detyrosinated microtubule network, which is associated with increased myocyte stiffness and impaired contractility. Pharmacological suppression of detyrosinated microtubules lowers the viscoelasticity of failing myocytes and restores 40–50% of lost contractile function; reduction of microtubule detyrosination using a genetic approach also softens cardiomyocytes and improves contractile kinetics. Together, these data demonstrate that a modified cytoskeletal network impedes contractile function in cardiomyocytes from failing human hearts and that targeting detyrosinated microtubules could represent a new inotropic strategy for improving cardiac function. Post-translational modification of microtubules by detyrosination is prevalent in failing human cardiomyocytes and inhibits cardiomyocyte contraction, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for improving heart function."
https://openalex.org/W2805660084,"Lung cancer is a devastating disease that remains a top cause of cancer mortality. Despite improvements with targeted and immunotherapies, the majority of patients with lung cancer lack effective therapies, underscoring the need for additional treatment approaches. Genomic studies have identified frequent alterations in components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex including SMARCA4 and ARID1A. To understand the mechanisms of tumorigenesis driven by mutations in this complex, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma by ablating Smarca4 in the lung epithelium. We demonstrate that Smarca4 acts as a bona fide tumor suppressor and cooperates with p53 loss and Kras activation. Gene expression analyses revealed the signature of enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in SMARCA4 mutant tumors. We further show that SMARCA4 mutant cells have enhanced oxygen consumption and increased respiratory capacity. Importantly, SMARCA4 mutant lung cancer cell lines and xenograft tumors have marked sensitivity to inhibition of OXPHOS by a novel small molecule, IACS-010759, that is under clinical development. Mechanistically, we show that SMARCA4-deficient cells have a blunted transcriptional response to energy stress creating a therapeutically exploitable synthetic lethal interaction. These findings provide the mechanistic basis for further development of OXPHOS inhibitors as therapeutics against SWI/SNF mutant tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2806432813,"Slow waves (0.5-4 Hz) predominate in the cortical electroencephalogram during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in mammals. They reflect the synchronization of large neuronal ensembles alternating between active (UP) and quiescent (Down) states and propagating along the neocortex. The thalamic contribution to cortical UP states and sleep modulation remains unclear. Here we show that spontaneous firing of centromedial thalamus (CMT) neurons in mice is phase-advanced to global cortical UP states and NREM-wake transitions. Tonic optogenetic activation of CMT neurons induces NREM-wake transitions, whereas burst activation mimics UP states in the cingulate cortex and enhances brain-wide synchrony of cortical slow waves during sleep, through a relay in the anterodorsal thalamus. Finally, we demonstrate that CMT and anterodorsal thalamus relay neurons promote sleep recovery. These findings suggest that the tonic and/or burst firing pattern of CMT neurons can modulate brain-wide cortical activity during sleep and provides dual control of sleep-wake states."

https://openalex.org/W2806000513,"Identifying disease-associated missense mutations remains a challenge, especially in large-scale sequencing studies. Here we establish an experimentally and computationally integrated approach to investigate the functional impact of missense mutations in the context of the human interactome network and test our approach by analyzing ~2,000 de novo missense mutations found in autism subjects and their unaffected siblings. Interaction-disrupting de novo missense mutations are more common in autism probands, principally affect hub proteins, and disrupt a significantly higher fraction of hub interactions than in unaffected siblings. Moreover, they tend to disrupt interactions involving genes previously implicated in autism, providing complementary evidence that strengthens previously identified associations and enhances the discovery of new ones. Importantly, by analyzing de novo missense mutation data from six disorders, we demonstrate that our interactome perturbation approach offers a generalizable framework for identifying and prioritizing missense mutations that contribute to the risk of human disease."

https://openalex.org/W2807970150,"Background There is limited literature about the clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes of rare histologic variants of gallbladder cancer (GBC). Methods Using SEER database, surgically managed GBC patients with microscopically confirmed adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous/squamous cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma were identified from 1988 to 2009. Patients with second primary cancer and distant metastasis at presentation were excluded. The effect of clinicopathological variables on overall survival (OS) and disease specific survival (DSS) were analyzed using univariate and multivariate proportional hazards modeling. All associations were considered statistically significant at an alpha error of 0.01. Results Out of 4738 cases, 217 adenosquamous/squamous (4.6%), 367 papillary (7.7%), and 4154 adenocarcinomas (87.7%) were identified. Median age was 72 years. Higher tumor grade (grade 2, 3, 4 versus grade 1), higher T stage (T2, T3, T4 versus T1), lymph node positivity (N1 versus N0) and adenosquamous/squamous histology (versus adenocarcinoma) had worse OS and DSS (p < .001). Papillary GBC had better OS and DSS than adenocarcinoma (HR = 0.7; p < .001). Radical surgery (versus simple cholecystectomy) had better OS (HR = 0.83, p = 0.002) in multivariate analysis. OS rates at 3 and 5 years were 0.56 and 0.44 for papillary, 0.3 and 0.22 for adenocarcinoma, and 0.14 and 0.12 for adenosquamous/squamous histology, while DSS rates at 3 and 5 years were 0.67 and 0.61 for papillary, 0.38 and 0.31 for adenocarcinoma, and 0.17 and 0.16 for adenosquamous/squamous subtypes respectively. Conclusion Papillary GBC had better survival outcomes while adenosquamous/squamous GBC had worse survival outcomes compared to gallbladder adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2808619307,"Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is the most abundant liver methyltransferase regulating the availability of the biological methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Moreover, GNMT has been identified to be down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite its role in regulating SAM levels and association of its down-regulation with liver tumorigenesis, the impact of reduced GNMT on metabolic reprogramming before the manifestation of HCC has not been investigated in detail. Herein, we used 2H/13C metabolic flux analysis in conscious, unrestrained mice to test the hypothesis that the absence of GNMT causes metabolic reprogramming. GNMT-null (KO) mice displayed a reduction in blood glucose that was associated with a decline in both hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The reduced gluconeogenesis was due to a decrease in liver gluconeogenic precursors, citric acid cycle fluxes, and anaplerosis and cataplerosis. A concurrent elevation in both hepatic SAM and metabolites of SAM utilization pathways was observed in the KO mice. Specifically, the increase in metabolites of SAM utilization pathways indicated that hepatic polyamine synthesis and catabolism, transsulfuration, and de novo lipogenesis pathways were increased in the KO mice. Of note, these pathways utilize substrates that could otherwise be used for gluconeogenesis. Also, this metabolic reprogramming occurs before the well-documented appearance of HCC in GNMT-null mice. Together, these results indicate that GNMT deletion promotes a metabolic shift whereby nutrients are channeled away from glucose formation toward pathways that utilize the elevated SAM."
https://openalex.org/W2807968746,"Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapeutic used for cancer treatment. Its use associates with peripheral neuropathies and chronic gastrointestinal side-effects. Oxaliplatin induces immunogenic cell death by provoking the presentation of damage associated molecular patterns. The damage associated molecular patterns high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein exerts pro-inflammatory cytokine-like activity and binds to toll-like receptors (namely TLR4). Gastrointestinal microbiota may influence chemotherapeutic efficacy and contribute to local and systemic inflammation. We studied effects of oxaliplatin treatment on 1) TLR4 and high-mobility group box 1 expression within the colon; 2) gastrointestinal microbiota composition; 3) inflammation within the colon; 4) changes in Peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes immune populations in mice. TLR4+ cells displayed pseudopodia-like extensions characteristic of antigen sampling co-localised with high-mobility group box 1 -overexpressing cells in the colonic lamina propria from oxaliplatin-treated animals. Oxaliplatin treatment caused significant reduction in Parabacteroides and Prevotella1, but increase in Prevotella2 and Odoribacter bacteria at the genus level. Downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in colon samples, a reduction in macrophages and dendritic cells in mesenteric lymph nodes were found after oxaliplatin treatment. In conclusion, oxaliplatin treatment caused morphological changes in TLR4+ cells, increase in gram-negative microbiota and enhanced HMGB1 expression associated with immunosuppression in the colon."
https://openalex.org/W2808004945,"The lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) is a dsDNA virus belonging to the Poxviridae family and the Capripoxvirus genus. Lumpy skin diseases (LSD) is a highly contagious transboundary disease in cattle producing major economic losses. In 2014, the disease was first reported in the European Union (in Cyprus); it was then reported in 2015 (in Greece) and has spread through different Balkan countries in 2016. Indirect vector transmission is predominant at small distances, but transmission between distant herds and between countries usually occurs through movements of infected cattle or through vectors found mainly in animal trucks.In order to estimate the threat for France due to the introduction of vectors found in animal trucks (cattle or horses) from at-risk countries (Balkans and neighbours), a quantitative import risk analysis (QIRA) model was developed according to the international standard. Using stochastic QIRA modelling and combining experimental/field data and expert opinion, the yearly risk of LSDV being introduced by stable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans), that travel in trucks transporting animals was between 6 x 10-5 and 5.93 x 10-3 with a median value of 89.9 x 10-5; it was mainly due to the risk related to insects entering farms in France from vehicles transporting cattle from the at-risk area. The risk related to the transport of cattle going to slaughterhouses or the transport of horses was much lower (between 2 x 10-7 and 3.73 x 10-5 and between 5 x 10-10 and 3.95 x 10-8 for cattle and horses, respectively). The disinsectisation of trucks transporting live animals was important to reduce this risk.The development of a stochastic QIRA made it possible to quantify the risk of LSD being introduced in France through the import of vectors that travel in trucks transporting animals. This tool is of prime importance because the LSD situation in the Balkans is continuously changing. Indeed, this model can be updated to process new information on vectors and the changing health situation, in addition to new data from the TRAde Control and Expert System (TRACES, EU database). This model is easy to adapt to different countries and to other vectors and diseases."

We have demonstrated that the deletion of Jarid2 (Jumonji (Jmj) A/T-rich interaction domain 2) in mice results in cardiac malformations recapitulating human congenital cardiac disease and dysregulation of gene expression. However, the precise developmental and epigenetic functions of Jarid2 within the developing heart remain to be elucidated. Here, we determined the cardiac-specific functions of Jarid2 and the genetic networks regulated by Jarid2. Jarid2 was deleted using different cardiac-specific Cre mice. The deletion of Jarid2 by Nkx2.5-Cre mice (Jarid2Nkx) caused cardiac malformations including ventricular septal defects, thin myocardium, hypertrabeculation, and neonatal lethality. Jarid2Nkx mice exhibited elevated expression of neural genes, cardiac jelly, and other key factors including Isl1 and Bmp10 in the developing heart. By employing combinatorial genome-wide approaches and molecular analyses, we showed that Jarid2 in the myocardium regulates a subset of Jarid2 target gene expression and H3K27me3 enrichment during heart development. Specifically, Jarid2 was required for PRC2 occupancy and H3K27me3 at the Isl1 promoter locus, leading to the proper repression of Isl1 expression. In contrast, Jarid2 deletion in differentiated cardiomyocytes by cTnt-Cre mice caused no gross morphological defects or neonatal lethality. Thus, the early deletion of Jarid2 in cardiac progenitors, prior to the differentiation of cardiac progenitors into cardiomyocytes, results in morphogenetic defects manifested later in development. Our studies reveal that there is a critical window during early cardiac progenitor differentiation when Jarid2 is crucial to establish the epigenetic landscape at later stages of development.

Normal cardiovascular development requires precise control of gene expression in a spatial and temporal-dependent manner. Eukaryotic gene transcription is regulated by chromatin structure partly via modifications of histone tails. Due to a groundbreaking discovery of histone demethylases such as Jumonji (Jmj) family factors, histone methylation is now considered a reversible epigenetic mark. Methylated histone tails are recognized as a marker for transcriptional activation or repression. In general, methylation at histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9), H3K27, or H4K20 is associated with gene repression, whereas methylation at H3K4, H3K36, or H3K79 is correlated with gene activation (2Greer E.L.

Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) in humans is characterized by a spongy ventricular myocardium with excessive trabeculations and deep trabecular recesses in the left ventricle leading to a thin ventricular wall (11Towbin J.A. Lorts A. Jefferies J.L. Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy.Lancet. 2015; 386 (25865865): 813-82510.1016/S0140-6736(14)61282-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), which is manifested in Jarid2 KO hearts (9Lee Y.

The American Heart Association formally classified LVNC as a distinct cardiomyopathy (11Towbin J.A. Lorts A. Jefferies J.L. Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy.Lancet. 2015; 386 (25865865): 813-82510.1016/S0140-6736(14)61282-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The genesis of LVNC has been speculated to represent an arrest of the final stage of myocardial morphogenesis, which is often referred to as “myocardial compaction” for a lack of better terminology. The etiology of LVNC remains unclear partly because the genetic causes of LVNC are heterogeneous, and there is insufficient knowledge on the molecular control of normal trabeculation and compaction during ventricular myocardial wall development.

During mammalian heart development, the ventricles undergo complex morphogenetic events (12Zhang W. Chen H. Qu X. Chang C.P. Shou W. Molecular mechanism of ventricular trabeculation/compaction and the pathogenesis of the left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC).Am. J. Med. Genet. C Semin. Med. Genet. 2013; 163C (23843320): 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The initial step is the formation of a single cell layer of myocardium at an early developmental stage, followed by the formation of a trabecular and compact myocardium at early midgestation stage. The final step involves the myocardial compaction to give rise to the thickened ventricular wall with the reduced trabecular layer at late midgestation stage, but molecular events leading to the mature ventricular wall remain poorly understood. In mouse models, noncompaction cardiomyopathy has been used to describe the thin compact layer with normal or excessive trabeculations, leading to the thin ventricular myocardial wall at mid- to late stages of cardiac development (13Chen H. Zhang W. Li D. Cordes T.M. Mark Payne R. Shou W. Analysis of ventricular hypertrabeculation and noncompaction using genetically engineered mouse models.Pediatr.

Notch pathways, Neuregulin1, and bone morphogenetic protein 10 (Bmp10) expression are critical for initiation and expansion of the trabecular layer, which in turn affect the ventricular wall thickness (12Zhang W. Chen H. Qu X. Chang C.P. Shou W. Molecular mechanism of ventricular trabeculation/compaction and the pathogenesis of the left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC).Am. J. Med. Genet. C Semin. Med. Genet. 2013; 163C (23843320): 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cardiac jelly between the endocardium and the underlying trabecular layer is also essential for initiation and growth of the trabecular layer (12Zhang W. Chen H. Qu X. Chang C.P. Shou W. Molecular mechanism of ventricular trabeculation/compaction and the pathogenesis of the left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC).Am. J. Med. Genet. C Semin. Med.

Interestingly, all of the above signals in the heart are significantly reduced in later developmental stages, which coincides with the cessation of trabeculation as well as compaction of the ventricular myocardium. Jarid2 functions as a major component of the transcriptional networks that balance pluripotency and differentiation in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Jarid2 is associated with the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in ES cells and is required for an efficient accumulation of PRC2 on the chromatin (7Shen X. Kim W. Fujiwara Y. Simon M.D. Liu Y.

Cell Biol. 2010; 12 (20473294): 618-62410.1038/ncb2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Major components of PRC2 consist of the SET domain containing histone methylases, EZH1/EZH2 and SUZ12, and EED, which specifically methylate at H3K27. Trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) is associated with repressed chromatin states, and widely distributed among genes encoding developmental regulators. However, it is debated whether Jarid2 loss in ES cells causes increases or decreases in H3K27me3 levels. PRC2 and H3K27me3 occupy a set of genes controlling differentiation and prevent full expression of these genes until lineage commitment in ES cells (17Jones A. Wang H. Polycomb repressive complex 2 in embryonic stem cells: an overview.Protein Cell. 2010; 1 (21213100): 1056-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Vizán P. Beringer M. Ballaré C. Di Croce L.

Although loss of Jarid2 or PRC2 function results in defective ES cell differentiation, the epigenetic role of Jarid2 remains unclear during heart development. We have demonstrated that the endothelial deletion of Jarid2 partially recapitulates cardiac defects observed in Jarid2 KO mice (19Mysliwiec M.R. Bresnick E.H. Lee Y. Endothelial Jarid2/Jumonji is required for normal cardiac development and proper Notch1 expression.J. Biol.

In the endocardial layer, Jarid2 represses Notch1 expression by interacting with Setdb1 via H3K9me3 enrichment at the Notch1 locus (8Mysliwiec M.R. Carlson C.D. Tietjen J. Hung H. Ansari A.Z. Lee Y. Jarid2 (Jumonji, AT-rich interactive domain 2) regulates NOTCH1 expression via histone modification in the developing heart.J. Biol.

This seems crucial for termination of trabeculation and initiation of compaction of the ventricular myocardial wall. As a major epigenetic marker, H3K9 methylation is known as a “histone code” for gene silencing. Conditional deletion of Ezh2, a catalytic subunit of PRC2, using Nkx2.5-Cre mice results in cardiac developmental defects such as hypertrabeculation, thinning of the compact myocardium, and VSD, which are similar to the defects observed in Jarid2 KO mice (9Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Jumonji, a nuclear protein that is necessary for normal heart development.Circ.

In this study, we demonstrate that cardiac-specific deletion of Jarid2 in cardiac progenitors and their progeny causes neonatal lethality and cardiac malformations including VSD, hypertrabeculation, and thin compact layer. In contrast, Jarid2 deletion in differentiated cardiomyocytes did not result in overt cardiac malformation. These data indicate that there is a critical window during early cardiac progenitor differentiation when Jarid2 is crucial to establish the epigenetic landscape at later stages of development. We provide evidence that Jarid2 cooperates with PRC2 for H3K27me3 accumulation on a subset of Jarid2 target genes in the developing heart, which contributes to repress differentiation of other lineages such as neural differentiation, and to guide normal myocardial development. Jarid2 deletion in mice causes congenital heart defects and death right after birth (9Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Jumonji, a nuclear protein that is necessary for normal heart development.Circ. Res. 2000; 86 (10807864): 932-93810.1161/01.RES.86.9.932Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the precise developmental and molecular functions of Jarid2 remain to be elucidated within the early developing heart. Thus, we set out to determine the cardiac-specific function of Jarid2 by deleting Jarid2 in cardiac progenitors and their progeny using Nkx2.5-Cre KI mice (Jarid2Nkx) (21Moses K.A. DeMayo F. Braun R.M. Reecy J.L. Schwartz R.J. Embryonic expression of an Nkx2–5/Cre gene using ROSA26 reporter mice.Genesis. 2001; 31 (11783008): 176-18010.1002/gene.10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We first analyzed Mendelian ratios from embryonic day (E) 9.5 through postnatal day (P) 10 (Table 1). The Mendelian ratios for Jarid2Nkx mutants (Nkx2.5-Cre/+;Jarid2f/f) were normal until birth, but all mutants succumbed to death within 1 day after birth. Heterozygous mutant mice (Nkx2.5-Cre/+;Jarid2f/+) were present at the expected Mendelian ratio. We further examined roles of Jarid2 within the myocardium after cardiac cells had differentiated to cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Jarid2 using αMHC-Cre mice causes neither gross cardiac malformation nor perinatal lethality (19Mysliwiec M.R. Bresnick E.H. Lee Y. Endothelial Jarid2/Jumonji is required for normal cardiac development and proper Notch1 expression.J. Biol.

It is plausible that Jarid2 plays a critical role earlier than expected. cTnt-Cre mice express Cre from E7.5 onwards, whereas αMHC-Cre mice express Cre at E8.5 (22Jiao K. Kulessa H. Tompkins K. Zhou Y. Batts L. Baldwin H.S. Hogan B.L. An essential role of Bmp4 in the atrioventricular septation of the mouse heart.Genes Dev. 2003; 17 (12975322): 2362-236710.1101/gad.1124803Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 23Agah R.

Jarid2cTnt mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio without overt cardiac defects (data not shown) and survived to adulthood (Table 1). These results suggest that Jarid2 in differentiated cardiomyocytes is dispensable for cardiac morphogenesis, supporting the critical roles of Jarid2 early in cardiac progenitors.Table 1Mendelian ratios of embryonic (E) or postnatal (P) miceCre mouseAgeNo. of littersNo. of live miceGenotype of live miceDead+/+;f/f+/+;f/+C/+;f/+C/+;f/fNkx2.5E9.5–14.541344799088874aTwo were not possible for genotyping because of necrosis, and the other two were +/+;f/+.(23.0%)(26.2%)(25.6%)(25.3%)E15–19.527192464852461bOne was C/+;f/f.(24.0%)(25.0%)(27.1%)(24.0%)P1–102410737353508cFive dead mice were C/+;f/f, two were +/+;f/f, and one was C/+;f/+.

All dead ones were observed at P1. Open table in a new tab We first confirmed that Jarid2 was efficiently deleted in the heart. PCR data on isolated genomic DNAs showed that the floxed exon 3 of Jarid2 was deleted only in the heart, but not in the tail or the brain of Jarid2Nkx embryos (Fig. 1A). Jarid2 transcripts and protein levels were significantly decreased in Jarid2Nkx versus control embryonic hearts (Fig. 1, B and C). Jarid2f/f mice were used as the control (Ctrl) throughout this study. Cardiac progenitors can contribute to different cardiac cell types such as endocardium. Conflicting reports exist that Nkx2.5-Cre mice delete a floxed allele only in the myocardium or both in the myocardium and endocardium due to an early expression of Cre in cardiac progenitors (20He A.

To determine whether Jarid2 is deleted only in the myocardium or also in the endocardium, co-immunostaining was performed using antibodies against Jarid2 and MF20, a cardiomyocyte marker (Fig. 1D). Jarid2 was detected in the control myocardium but was not detectable in the Jarid2Nkx myocardium (arrowheads). In contrast, Jarid2 was detected in the endocardium of the Jarid2Nkx heart similar to the control endocardium as indicated by arrows. When primary cultured cells isolated from Jarid2Nkx hearts were co-immunostained using Jarid2 and MF20 or PECAM antibodies, Jarid2 expression was detected in PECAM-positive cells, whereas it was not detectable in MF20 positive cells (Fig. S1, A and B). These data suggest that Jarid2 was deleted in cardiomyocytes but not in endothelial/endocardial cells. We have previously demonstrated that Jarid2 plays important roles in the endocardium by repressing Notch1-Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) signaling pathways to the underlying myocardium (8Mysliwiec M.R. Carlson C.D. Tietjen J. Hung H. Ansari A.Z. Lee Y. Jarid2 (Jumonji, AT-rich interactive domain 2) regulates NOTCH1 expression via histone modification in the developing heart.J. Biol.

Because we cannot exclude a possibility that Jarid2 may be deleted in a subpopulation of endocardial cells in Jarid2Nkx hearts, we examined whether endocardial signaling pathways are altered in Jarid2Nkx hearts. qRT-PCR data showed that Notch1-Nrg1 pathways were not increased in Jarid2Nkx versus control hearts (Fig. S1C). Furthermore, none of the Jarid2 mutants generated by other cardiac Cre drivers including αMHC-, MLC2v-, and Nkx2.5-transgenic (Tg) Cre showed cardiac malformations or perinatal lethality (19Mysliwiec M.R. Bresnick E.H. Lee Y. Endothelial Jarid2/Jumonji is required for normal cardiac development and proper Notch1 expression.J. Biol.

These data support that Jarid2 functions normally in the endocardial cells of Jarid2Nkx hearts. Next, we examined cardiac defects in mutant hearts during development by H&E staining of transverse sections (Fig. 2). At E12.5, Jarid2Nkx hearts showed the grossly normal trabecular and compact layers in the ventricle as compared with the control hearts (Fig. 2A, a and b). However, an increased space between the endocardium and the myocardium was observed in Jarid2Nkx versus control hearts as indicated by an arrow (Fig. 2A, c and d). Around E14, the interventricular septum in the control heart fused to the endocardial cushion and separated the right and left ventricles (Fig. 2A, e). In contrast, Jarid2Nkx hearts showed defective interventricular septation leading to VSD as indicated by a star (Fig. 2A, f). Due to decreased cardiac jelly in the normal heart around E14, the endocardium is in direct contact with the myocardium for termination of trabeculation and compaction of trabeculae into the compact layer, leading to the development of a thick ventricular wall (14Stankunas K. Hang C.T. Tsun Z.Y. Chen H. Lee N.V. Wu J.I. Shang C. Bayle J.H. Shou W. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Chang C.P.

However, Jarid2Nkx ventricles at E14 showed an increased subendocardial space (arrow), a thin compact layer (Fig. 2A, h), and hypertrabeculae (Fig. 2A, f, arrowhead) as compared with controls (Fig. 2A, e and g). At E15.5, the mutants continued to show VSDs (star), thin myocardium, and hypertrabeculation (Fig. 2A, j and l, arrowhead) compared with controls (Fig. 2A, i and k), which persisted in Jarid2Nkx mutant hearts at P1 (Fig. 2A, n). Ventricular wall thickness and a distribution of trabeculae were quantitated at E15.5, indicating a decrease in compact layer thickness mainly in the left ventricle, and an increase in trabeculation in the ventricle of Jarid2Nkx hearts (Fig. 2B). Jarid2Nkx hearts exhibited partially penetrant cardiac defects as summarized in Table 2 (see details in Table S1). Some Jarid2 heterozygous mutant mice (Nkx2.5-Cre/+;Jarid2f/+) showed cardiac defects, whereas either Nkx2.5-Cre alone (Nkx2.5-Cre/+;Jarid2+/+, Table 2 and Fig. S2) or Jarid2 whole body heterozygous mutants (9Lee Y. Song A.J. Baker R. Micales B. Conway S.J. Lyons G.E. Jumonji, a nuclear protein that is necessary for normal heart development.Circ.

Because Nkx2.5-Cre mice contain a deletion of Nkx2.5 in one allele, these results suggest that Nkx2.5 and Jarid2 may cooperate functionally or genetically during development. In summary, Jarid2Nkx mutants exhibit ventricular defects including increased subendocardial space, VSD, hypertrabeculation, and the thin compact layer of the ventricular wall.Table 2Cardiac phenotypic defects observed in Jarid2Nkx miceStagesGenotypeNo. of miceVSDHypertrabeculationThin myocardiumE15.5–E19.5Control (+/+;f/f)10000Jarid2Nkx (C/+;f/f)1110 (91%)9 (82%)8 (73%)Nkx2.5-Cre (C/+;+/+)7000Heterozygous (C/+;f/+)71 (14%)1 (14%)1 (14%) Open table in a new tab Increased subendocardial space in Jarid2Nkx hearts is indicative of increased cardiac jelly.

https://openalex.org/W2808208584,"Bacteria use various endogenous antioxidants for protection against oxidative stress associated with environmental survival or host infection. Although glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant and widely used antioxidant in Proteobacteria, ergothioneine (EGT) is another microbial antioxidant, mainly produced by fungi and Actinobacteria. The Burkholderia genus is found in diverse environmental niches. We observed that gene homologs required for the synthesis of EGT are widely distributed throughout the genus. By generating gene-deletion mutants and monitoring production with isotope-labeled substrates, we show that pathogenic Burkholderia pseudomallei and environmental B. thailandensis areabletosynthesize EGT de novo. Unlike most other bacterial EGT synthesis pathways described, Burkholderia spp. use cysteine rather than γ-glutamyl cysteine as the thiol donor. Analysis of recombinant EgtB indicated that it is a proficient sulfoxide synthase, despite divergence in the active site architecture from that of mycobacteria. The absence of GSH, but not EGT, increased bacterial susceptibility to oxidative stresses in vitro. However, deletion of EGT synthesis conferred a reduced fitness to B. pseudomallei, with a delay in organ colonization and time to death during mouse infection. Therefore, despite the lack of an apparent antioxidant role in vitro, EGT is important for optimal bacterial pathogenesis in the mammalian host.—Gamage, A. M., Liao, C., Cheah, I.

We report here the discovery of a novel lantibiotic for the treatment of C. difficile infection (CDI). The leads were selected from a library of over 300 multiple substitution variants of the lantibiotic Mutacin 1140 (MU1140). Top performers were selected based on testing for superior potency, solubility, manufacturability, and physicochemical and/or metabolic stability in biologically-relevant systems. The best performers in vitro were further evaluated orally in the Golden Syrian hamster model of CDAD. In vivo testing ultimately identified OG716 as the lead compound, which conferred 100% survival and no relapse at 3 weeks post infection. MU1140-derived variants are particularly attractive for further clinical development considering their novel mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W2808299179,"Pathogens causing acute disease and death or lasting immunity require specific spatial or temporal processes to persist in populations. Host traits, such as maternally-derived antibody (MDA) and seasonal birthing affect infection maintenance within populations. Our study objective is to understand how viral and host traits lead to population level infection persistence when the infection can be fatal. We collected data on African fruit bats and a rabies-related virus, Lagos bat virus (LBV), including through captive studies. We incorporate these data into a mechanistic model of LBV transmission to determine how host traits, including MDA and seasonal birthing, and viral traits, such as incubation periods, interact to allow fatal viruses to persist within bat populations. Captive bat studies supported MDA presence estimated from field data. Captive bat infection-derived antibody decayed more slowly than MDA, and while faster than estimates from the field, supports field data that suggest antibody persistence may be lifelong. Unobserved parameters were estimated by particle filtering and suggest only a small proportion of bats die of disease. Pathogen persistence in the population is sensitive to this proportion, along with MDA duration and incubation period. Our analyses suggest MDA produced bats and prolonged virus incubation periods allow viral maintenance in adverse conditions, such as a lethal pathogen or strongly seasonal resource availability for the pathogen in the form of seasonally pulsed birthing."
https://openalex.org/W2805132153,"We demonstrate that a Drosophila Golgi protein, Gorab, is present not only in the trans-Golgi but also in the centriole cartwheel where, complexed to Sas6, it is required for centriole duplication. In addition to centriole defects, flies lacking Gorab are uncoordinated due to defects in sensory cilia, which lose their nine-fold symmetry. We demonstrate the separation of centriole and Golgi functions of Drosophila Gorab in two ways: first, we have created Gorab variants that are unable to localize to trans-Golgi but can still rescue the centriole and cilia defects of gorab null flies; second, we show that expression of C-terminally tagged Gorab disrupts Golgi functions in cytokinesis of male meiosis, a dominant phenotype overcome by mutations preventing Golgi targeting. Our findings suggest that during animal evolution, a Golgi protein has arisen with a second, apparently independent, role in centriole duplication. The roles of of Gorab in the Golgi and in centriole structure and function can be separated mutationally in Drosophila. Complexed to Sas6 in the centriolar cartwheel, Gorab is essential for mitotic centriole duplication in the fly."
https://openalex.org/W2808546717,"Adipose tissue–derived stem cell (ADSC)–based therapy is promising for the treatment of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, but the difficulty in inducing nucleus pulposus (NP)–like differentiation limits its clinical applications. Forkhead box (Fox)-A2 is an essential transcription factor for the formation of a normal NP. We demonstrated that type II collagen stimulates NP-like differentiation of ADSCs, partly by increasing the expression of FoxA2. We constructed FoxA2-overexpressing and -knockdown ADSCs by using lentiviral vectors. FoxA2 overexpression significantly enhanced NP-specific gene expression and the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan and collagen, whereas FoxA2 knockdown decreased NP-like differentiation and the expression of aggrecan and collagen II. The enhanced NP-like differentiation related to FoxA2 overexpression was partially rescued by an Shh signaling pathway inhibitor. In addition, FoxA2 inhibited the expression of Itg-α2 and further promoted NP-like differentiation induced by type II collagen. Furthermore, FoxA2-overexpressing ADSCs combined with type II collagen hydrogels promoted regeneration of degenerated NP in vivo. Our findings suggest that FoxA2 plays an essential role in the NP-like differentiation of ADSCs by activating the Shh signaling pathway.—Zhou, X., Ma, C., Hu, B., Tao, Y., Wang, J., Huang, X., Zhao, T., Han, B., Li, H., Liang, C., Chen, Q., Li, F.

https://openalex.org/W2808316766,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal expansion of polyglutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein (Htt). Transcriptional dysregulation is an early event in the course of HD progression and is thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis, but how mutant Htt causes transcriptional alterations and subsequent cell death in neurons is not well understood. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that expression of a mutant Htt fragment in primary cortical neurons leads to robust gene expression changes before neuronal death. Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1, which is essential for embryogenesis and is normally expressed at low levels in mature neurons, was substantially up-regulated in mutant Htt–expressing neurons in culture and in the brains of HD mouse models. Knockdown of Twist1 by RNAi in mutant Htt–expressing primary cortical neurons reversed the altered expression of a subset of genes involved in neuronal function and, importantly, abrogated neurotoxicity. Using brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), which is known to be involved in HD pathogenesis, as a model gene, we found that Twist1 knockdown could reverse mutant Htt–induced DNA hypermethylation at the Bdnf regulatory region and reactivate Bdnf expression. Together, these results suggest that Twist1 is an important upstream mediator of mutant Htt–induced neuronal death and may in part operate through epigenetic mechanisms.

In this report, we identify mutant Htt (exon 1)–induced genome-wide transcriptome changes in cortical neurons, a vulnerable neuronal type in HD. Among altered genes, we focused on basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Twist1, which is significantly up-regulated by mutant Htt expression in neurons. Whereas the function of Twist1 has been well studied in embryogenesis and cancer metastasis (39Ansieau S. Morel A.P. Hinkal G. Bastid J. Puisieux A.

In this system, a neuropathogenic fragment of mutant Htt, the exon 1–encoded N-terminal fragment with a 72-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat (Htt-72Q), versus WT Htt with a 25-polyQ repeat (Htt-25Q), is expressed in mouse primary cortical neurons by lentivirus (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the diffuse cytosolic localization of WT Htt, accumulation of aggregated mutant Htt was observed preferentially in the nucleus by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B). Consistently, immunoblot analysis with Htt-72Q–expressing neurons showed aggregated high-molecular weight mutant protein (Fig. 1C). Our previous studies have shown that expression of mutant, but not WT, Htt significantly reduced neuronal viability compared with that of control empty vector (21Pan Y. Daito T. Sasaki Y. Chung Y.H.

To identify critical gene expression changes associated with mutant Htt expression in neurons, RNA-Seq analysis was performed using RNA samples prepared from cortical neurons at 5 days following Htt virus infection (DIV 10), a time when neurons do not yet show mutant Htt–induced changes in viability (Fig. 1D). We identified marked transcriptional changes, with 1391 up-regulated and 2314 down-regulated genes (FDR < 0.05), in mutant Htt-72Q–expressing neurons compared with WT Htt-25Q–expressing neurons (Fig. 1E and Table S1). The transcriptome of Htt-25Q–expressing neurons was not significantly different from control neurons transduced with empty-vector lentivirus (Fig. 1E). To gain insight into pathways that are potentially affected by mutant Htt, we performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses using the DAVID functional classification tool (Fig. 1, F and G) (46Huang D.W. Sherman B.T. Tan Q. Collins J.R. Alvord W.G. Roayaei J. Stephens R. Baseler M.W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. The DAVID Gene Functional Classification Tool: a novel biological module-centric algorithm to functionally analyze large gene lists.Genome Biol. 2007; 8 (17784955): R18310.1186/gb-2007-8-9-r183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The differentially expressed genes in mutant Htt–expressing cortical neurons (|log2FC| > 0.5, FDR < 0.05) were associated with a number of specific biological processes and molecular function (Fig. 1 (F and G) and Table S2). In particular, up-regulated genes were associated with biological processes, including regulation of transcription, and down-regulated genes were associated with biological processes relevant to brain and nervous system function, including nervous system development, axon guidance, cell adhesion, and synaptic transmission (Fig. 1F). Molecular function analysis revealed that up-regulated genes were enriched in genes encoding transcriptional regulators, including sequence-specific DNA binding, transcriptional activator activity, and transcriptional factor activity (Fig. 1G). Down-regulated genes are enriched in genes related to calcium ion binding and ion channel activity (Fig. 1G). These results raise the interesting possibility that altered levels of transcriptional regulators represent an early event in the transcriptional dysregulation observed in mutant Htt–expressing neurons. We next examined whether gene expression changes found in our cortical neuron system were observed in mouse and human HD brains in vivo in a previous study (11Vashishtha M. Ng C.W. Yildirim F.

https://openalex.org/W2808388238,"Objective Gestural interfaces allow accessing and manipulating Electronic Medical Records (EMR) in hospitals while keeping a complete sterile environment. Particularly, in the Operating Room (OR), these interfaces enable surgeons to browse Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) without the need of delegating functions to the surgical staff. Existing gesture based medical interfaces rely on a suboptimal and an arbitrary small set of gestures that are mapped to a few commands available in PACS software. The objective of this work is to discuss a method to determine the most suitable set of gestures based on surgeon’s acceptability. To achieve this goal, the paper introduces two key innovations: (a) a novel methodology to incorporate gestures’ semantic properties into the agreement analysis, and (b) a new agreement metric to determine the most suitable gesture set for a PACS. Materials and methods Three neurosurgical diagnostic tasks were conducted by nine neurosurgeons. The set of commands and gesture lexicons were determined using a Wizard of Oz paradigm. The gestures were decomposed into a set of 55 semantic properties based on the motion trajectory, orientation and pose of the surgeons’ hands and their ground truth values were manually annotated. Finally, a new agreement metric was developed, using the known Jaccard similarity to measure consensus between users over a gesture set. Results A set of 34 PACS commands were found to be a sufficient number of actions for PACS manipulation. In addition, it was found that there is a level of agreement of 0.29 among the surgeons over the gestures found. Two statistical tests including paired t-test and Mann Whitney Wilcoxon test were conducted between the proposed metric and the traditional agreement metric. It was found that the agreement values computed using the former metric are significantly higher (p < 0.001) for both tests. Conclusions This study reveals that the level of agreement among surgeons over the best gestures for PACS operation is higher than the previously reported metric (0.29 vs 0.13). This observation is based on the fact that the agreement focuses on main features of the gestures rather than the gestures themselves. The level of agreement is not very high, yet indicates a majority preference, and is better than using gestures based on authoritarian or arbitrary approaches. The methods described in this paper provide a guiding framework for the design of future gesture based PACS systems for the OR."
https://openalex.org/W2808328006,"Introduction Cardiac toxicity after definitive chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer is a critical issue. To reduce irradiation doses to organs at risk, individual internal margins need to be identified and minimized. The purpose of this study was to quantify esophageal motion using fiducial makers based on four-dimensional computed tomography, and to evaluate the inter-CBCT session marker displacement using breath-hold. Materials and methods Sixteen patients with early stage esophageal cancer, who received endoscopy-guided metallic marker placement for treatment planning, were included; there were 35 markers in total, with 9, 15, and 11 markers in the upper thoracic, middle thoracic, and lower thoracic/esophagogastric junction regions, respectively. We defined fiducial marker motion as motion of the centroidal point of the markers. Respiratory esophageal motion during free-breathing was defined as the amplitude of individual marker motion between the consecutive breathing and end-expiration phases, derived from four-dimensional computed tomography. The inter-CBCT session marker displacement using breath-hold was defined as the amplitudes of marker motion between the first and each cone beam computed tomography image. Marker motion was analyzed in the three regions (upper thoracic, middle thoracic, and lower thoracic/esophagogastric junction) and in three orthogonal directions (right-left; anterior-posterior; and superior-inferior). Results Respiratory esophageal motion during free-breathing resulted in median absolute maximum amplitudes (interquartile range), in right-left, anterior-posterior, and superior-inferior directions, of 1.7 (1.4) mm, 2.0 (1.5) mm, and 3.6 (4.1) mm, respectively, in the upper thoracic region, 0.8 (1.1) mm, 1.4 (1.2) mm, and 4.8 (3.6) mm, respectively, in the middle thoracic region, and 1.8 (0.8) mm, 1.9 (2.0) mm, and 8.0 (4.5) mm, respectively, in the lower thoracic/esophagogastric region. The inter-CBCT session marker displacement using breath-hold resulted in median absolute maximum amplitudes (interquartile range), in right-left, anterior–posterior, and superior-inferior directions, of 1.3 (1.0) mm, 1.1 (0.7) mm, and 3.3 (1.8) mm, respectively, in the upper thoracic region, 0.7 (0.7) mm, 1.1 (0.4) mm, and 3.4 (1.4) mm, respectively, in the middle thoracic region, and 2.0 (0.8) mm, 2.6 (2.2) mm, and 3.5 (1.8) mm, respectively, in the lower thoracic/esophagogastric region. Conclusions During free-breathing, esophageal motion in the superior-inferior direction in all sites was large, compared to the other directions, and amplitudes showed substantial inter-individual variability. The breath-hold technique is feasible for minimizing esophageal displacement during radiotherapy in patients with esophageal cancer."

The aim of this study was to determine whether physical activity, as assessed by a smart band activity tracker, is associated with preterm birth in pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery.This was a pilot prospective cohort study including pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery between 24 and 32 weeks-of-gestation. Physical activity level was assessed by smart band activity. Patients with sonographic short cervical length (≤ 20 mm) were asked to wear the smart band activity tracker continuously for at least one week, including one weekend. Both physicians and patients were blinded to the data stored in the smart band activity tracker. No specific recommendations were given to participants as to the level or intensity of physical activity. The primary outcome was the rate of preterm birth (< 37 weeks-of-gestation). Secondary outcomes included the rate of delivery before 34 weeks of gestation and neonatal outcome. Parametric and nonparametric statistics were used for analysis.Study population included 49 pregnant women: 37 women (75.7%) delivered preterm and 12 (24.5%) delivered at or after 37 weeks-of-gestation. The median steps per day was significantly lower in patients who delivered preterm (3576, IQR: 2478-4775 vs. 4554, IQR: 3632-6337, p = 0.02). Regression analysis revealed that the median number of steps per day was independently inversely associated with preterm birth, after adjustment for maternal age, body mass index, gestational age at recruitment, cervical length, cervical dilatation and plurality.This pilot study represents the first quantitative assessment of the association between physical activity and preterm birth. The results of this pilot study do not support the efficacy of decreased physical activity in the prevention of preterm birth in patients with sonographic short cervical length."

We compare the differential expression profile of early-stage MF samples and benign inflammatory dermatoses using microRNA (miRNA) arrays. 114 miRNAs were found to be dysregulated between these entities. The seven most differentially expressed miRNAs between these two conditions were further analyzed using RT-PCR in two series comprising 38 samples of early MFs and 18 samples of inflammatory dermatitis. A series of 51 paraffin-embedded samples belonging to paired stages of 16 MF patients was also analyzed. MiRNAs 26a, 222, 181a and 146a were differentially expressed between tumoral and inflammatory conditions. Two of these miRNAs (miRNA-181a and miRNA-146a) were significantly deregulated between early and advanced MF stages. Bioinformatic analysis showed FOXP3 expression to be regulated by these miRNAs. Immunohistochemistry revealed the level of FOXP3 expression to be lower in tumoral MFs than in plaque lesions in paraffin-embedded tissue. A functional study confirmed that both miRNAs diminished FOXP3 expression when overexpressed in CTCL cells. The data presented here suggest that the analysis of a restricted number of miRNAs (26a, 222, 181a and 146a) could be sufficient to differentiate tumoral from reactive conditions. Moreover, these miRNAs seem to be involved in MF progression."
https://openalex.org/W2807811942,"Circadian clocks, present in almost all cells of the body, are entrained to rhythmic changes in the environment (e.g. light/dark cycles). Genes responsible for this timekeeping are named core-clock genes, which through transcriptional feedback interactions mediated by transcription factor binding to Ebox/RRE/Dbox elements can generate oscillatory activity of their expression. By regulating the transcription of other clock-controlled genes (CCGs) circadian information is transmitted to tissue and organ levels. Recent studies have indicated that there is a considerable variability of clock-controlled gene expression between tissues both with respect to the circadian genes that are regulated and to their phase lags. In this work, a mathematical model was adapted to explore the dynamics of core-clock and clock-controlled genes measured in four tissues of the rat namely liver, muscle, adipose, and lung. The model efficiently described the synchronous rhythmicity of core-clock genes and further predicted that their phases are mainly regulated by Per2 and Cry1 transcriptional delays and Rev-Erba and Cry1 degradation rates. Similarly, after mining databases for potential Ebox/RRE/Dbox elements in the promoter region of clock-controlled genes, the phase variabilities of the same genes between different tissues were described. The analysis suggests that inter-tissue circadian variability of the same clock-controlled genes is an inherent component of homeostatic function and may arise due to different transcription factor activities on Ebox/RRE/Dbox elements."
https://openalex.org/W2807883923,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a growing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure, a major cause of COPD, dysregulates airway epithelial ion transport and diminishes airway surface liquid (ASL) volume. Short palate lung and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC1) is secreted into the airway lumen where it maintains airway hydration via interactions with the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Although ASL hydration is dysregulated in CS-exposed/COPD airways, effects of CS on SPLUNC1 have not been elucidated. We hypothesized that CS alters SPLUNC1 activity, therefore contributing to ASL dehydration. CS exposure caused irreversible SPLUNC1 aggregation and prevented SPLUNC1 from internalizing ENaC and maintaining ASL hydration. Proteomic analysis revealed αβ-unsaturated aldehyde modifications to SPLUNCL's cysteine residues. Removal of these cysteines prevented SPLUNC1 from regulating ENaC/ASL volume. In contrast, SPX-101, a peptide mimetic of natural SPLUNC1, that internalizes ENaC, but does not contain cysteines was unaffected by CS. SPX-101 increased ASL hydration and attenuated ENaC activity in airway cultures after CS exposure and prolonged survival in a chronic airway disease model. These findings suggest that the CS-induced defects in SPLUNC1 can be circumvented, thus making SPX-101 a novel candidate for the treatment of mucus dehydration in COPD.—Moore, P.

https://openalex.org/W2808324208,"Diagnosis of fetal anomaly is a significant life event and social stigma can negatively impact on the well-being of women opting for an abortion. This study investigated the psychometric properties of a measure of stigma among women who had had an abortion after diagnosis of fetal anomaly in a German setting.The Individual Level Abortion Stigma (ILAS) scale was translated into German. Psychometric properties of the ILAS scale were examined among 130 women with a history of an abortion after diagnosis of fetal anomaly. Individual and situational factors associated with stigma in the context of an abortion after diagnosis of fetal anomaly were explored.Factor analysis suggested a four-dimensional structure of the German version of the Individual Level Abortion Stigma scale (Cronbach's α, .83-.91), corresponding to the subscales of the original scale. Test-retest reliability was acceptable for the worries about judgment subscale, the self-judgment subscale, and the community condemnation subscale, but less convincing for the isolation subscale. Associations between the subscales and measures of depression, self-esteem and secrecy were found in directions consistent with theory. Women who did not perceive their fetus to have a low survival chance and women whose fetus was at higher gestational age reported higher levels of stigma, whereas higher perceived partner support was associated with lower levels of stigma.Generalizability of study results was limited, as participants were recruited from one clinic in Germany and the study had a response rate of 46.5%.The ILAS subscales are largely reliable and valid measures to assess stigma among women who have had an abortion after diagnosis of fetal anomaly. Suggestions for improving the assessment of stigma experienced in this population are outlined. The scales can be useful in research aiming at investigating psychological outcomes of abortion after diagnosis of fetal anomaly and improving care structures."
https://openalex.org/W2808379154,"Although late-onset circulatory collapse (LCC) is widely recognized in Japan, its etiology and the reason for center variation in its incidence remain unclear. This study's objectives were to identify the perinatal and neonatal factors related to LCC and to estimate the factors related to the center variation in the incidence of LCC.Extremely preterm infants born between 2008 and 2012 who were registered in the database of the Neonatal Research Network, Japan were retrospectively analyzed. LCC was defined as a clinical diagnosis of LCC and the administration of steroids. We first identified the factors that were significantly related to LCC. We then examined the cause of the center variation in the incidence of LCC, using the standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of LCC and individual factors.The factors significantly associated with LCC included low gestational age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.13), small for date (OR: 1.43), male sex (OR: 1.26), antenatal steroid use (OR: 1.19), respiratory distress syndrome (OR: 1.25), chronic lung disease at 36 weeks (OR: 1.16), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) (OR: 2.57), necrotizing enterocolitis (OR: 0.59), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (OR: 1.73), high-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV) use (OR: 1.31), parenteral nutrition (OR: 1.38), and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (OR: 1.94). The SIR of LCC ranged from 0.05 to 2.94, and was positively correlated with SIRs of PVL, ROP, HFOV use and RBC transfusion.PVL, ROP, HFOV use and RBC transfusion were found to be correlated with the center variation in the incidence of LCC."
https://openalex.org/W2807937337,"Physical activity declines are seen with increasing age; however, the US CDC recommends most older adults (age 65 and older) engage in the same levels of physical activity as those 18-64 to lessen risks of injuries (e.g., falls) and slow deteriorating health. We aimed to identify whether older adults participating in a short (approx. 90-minute sessions) 20 session (approximately 10-weeks) health and wellness program delivered in a community setting saw improvements in physical activity and whether these were sustained over time.Employing a non-equivalent group design, community-dwelling older adults were purposely recruited into either an intervention or comparison group. The intervention was a multicomponent lifestyle enhancement intervention focused on healthy eating and physical activity, including structured physical activity exercises within the class sessions. Two groups were included: intervention (survey group: n = 65; accelerometer subgroup: n = 38) and the comparison group (survey group: n = 102; accelerometer subgroup: n = 55). Measurements were made at baseline and approximately three months later to reflect immediate post-treatment period (survey, accelerometer) with long-term follow-up 6 months after baseline (survey). Adults not meeting the physical activity guidelines (i.e., 150/75 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity or MVPA) were targeted for subgroup analyses. Paired t-tests were used for bivariate comparisons, while repeated measures random coefficient models (adjusting for propensity scores using inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) estimation) were used for multivariate models. Estimated medical costs associated with gains in physical activity were also measured among survey respondents in the intervention group.The accelerometer group contained 38 participants in the intervention group with 71% insufficiently active at baseline and 55 participants in the comparison group with 76% insufficiently active at baseline (<150 weekly MVPA minutes). The survey group contained 65 participants in the intervention group with 73.85% insufficiently active at baseline and 102 participants in the comparison group with 76.47% insufficiently active at baseline. In paired t-tests with the accelerometer group, a moderate effect size (-0.4727, p = 0.0210) indicating higher MVPA was found for intervention participants with <150 weekly MVPA at baseline. In fully adjusted analyses using propensity score matching, among the subjectively measured physical activity (survey) group, there was a differential impact from baseline to 6-month post among the intervention group with an improvement of 160 minutes among all study participants (p < .0001) versus no difference among the comparison group. For those insufficiently active at baseline, there was an improvement of 103 minutes among intervention (p < .0001) and 55 minutes among the comparison (p < .0001) with the improvement of the intervention significantly greater than that among the comparison (p = 0.0224). Further, among those insufficiently active at baseline there was a relative cost savings from baseline to 6-months over and above the estimated cost of the intervention estimated between $143 and $164 per participant.This intervention was able to reach and retain older adults and showed significant MVPA gains and estimated medical cost savings among more at-risk individuals (baseline <150 MVPA). This intervention can be used in practice as a strategy to improve MVPA among the growing population of older community-dwelling adults."
https://openalex.org/W2807806308,"Immunoproteomic analysis was performed to identify unknown, pathology-related molecules in patients with seronegative (SN) obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) who clinically satisfied the diagnostic criteria for APS, but not the serological criteria. We collected peripheral blood from 13 SN-APS outpatients with known thrombotic predisposition, 13 with no known thrombotic predisposition, and four multiparous women with no history of miscarriage (control). Plasma proteins from volunteers were purified and used as plasma protein antigens. Two-dimensional immunoblotting was performed using pooled control or SN-APS serum samples as the primary antibodies. Mass spectrometry of reactive spots specific to SN-APS serum led to the identification of complement molecule C9. Western blotting using commercial purified alkylated C9 was performed to detect autoantibodies. Examination of individual patient serum identified reactivity in one patient with, and in two patients without known thrombotic predisposition. This study suggests that SN-APS pathologies were associated with autoantibodies that react to specific C9 epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W2808251866,"Following cytokinesis in plants, Endoplasmic MTs (EMTs) assemble on the nuclear surface, forming a radial network that extends out to the cell cortex, where they attach and incorporate into the cortical microtubule (CMT) array. We found that in these post-cytokinetic cells, the MT-associated protein CLASP is enriched at sites of EMT-cortex attachment, and is required for stable EMT tethering and growth into the cell cortex. Loss of EMT-cortex anchoring in clasp-1 mutants results in destabilized EMT arrays, and is accompanied by enhanced mobility of the cytoplasm, premature vacuolation, and precocious entry into cell elongation phase. Thus, EMTs appear to maintain cells in a meristematic state by providing a structural scaffold that stabilizes the cytoplasm to counteract actomyosin-based cytoplasmic streaming forces, thereby preventing premature establishment of a central vacuole and rapid cell elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2808504220,"A high coronary artery calcium score (CACS) predicts a poor prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease. We examined the relationship between the bifurcation angle and the CACS of the left main (LM) and left anterior descending (LAD) arteries in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD).We analyzed the data of 121 patients who underwent coronary computed tomography between October 2014 and June 2015 and whose estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. The LM-LAD bifurcation angle was measured by 3-dimensional coronary computed tomography. The CACS of the LM-LAD arteries was also calculated. We excluded stent recipients and patient who had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery.In the overall sample, the mean ± standard deviation (range) LM-LAD bifurcation angle was 35.9 ± 11.4° (6.8-79.4°) and mean CACS was 227 ± 351 (0 to 1,695). The mean LM-LAD arteries angle was 40.3° ± 10.0° in 39 patients whose CACS was ≥200, versus 33.8° ± 11.6° in 82 patients with CACS <200 (p = 0.003). A weak, but positive correlation (r = 0.269, p = 0.003) was observed between the LM-LAD arteries angle and CACS of the LM-LAD arteries. By multiple variable analysis, hemoglobin A1c, triglycerides, eGFR and the LM-LAD arteries angle were independent predictors of a high CACS of the LM-LAD arteries.In patients with CKD, a wide LM-LAD arteries angle was associated with a high CACS of the LM-LAD arteries. The prognostic value of this observation warrants further evaluation."

https://openalex.org/W2807878618,"The self-healing phenomenon can be found in the elastase-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) model, and an enlarging AAA model was successfully induced by coarctation. Unfortunately, aortic coarctation in these enlarging models is generally not found in human AAA disease. This study aimed to create an experiment model of enlarging AAA in rabbits to better mimic human aortic aneurysm disease. Eighty-four male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into three equal groups: two aneurysm groups (A and B) and a SHAM group. Aneurysm group rabbits underwent extrinsic aortic stenosis below the right renal artery and received a 10-minute incubation of 60 μl elastase (1 unit/μl). Absorbable suture was used in Group A and nonabsorbable cotton thread was used in Group B. A sham operation was performed in the SHAM group. Aortic diameter was measured after 1, 3, 7, and 15 weeks; thereafter animals were sacrificed for histopathological, immunohistochemical and quantitative studies. Two rabbits died at 29 and 48 days, respectively, after operation in Group B. All aneurysms formed and enlarged progressively by 3 weeks in the Aneurysm groups. However, diameter enlargement in Group A was significantly lower than that in Group B at 7 weeks. Aneurysm groups developed intimal hyperplasia; intima-media thickness (IMT) increased significantly by week 7, and aortic media thickness and intima-media ratio (IMR) increased significantly by week 15. Marked destruction of elastin fibers and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) occurred 1 week later and increased progressively thereafter. Intimal hyperplasia and SMCs content in Group A increased significantly by week 15 compared with Group B. Aneurysm groups exhibited strong expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 and RAM11 by week 1, and decreased progressively thereafter. In conclusion, this novel rabbit AAA model enlarges progressively without coarctation and is capable of better mimicking human aortic aneurysm disease."
https://openalex.org/W2808366141,"Background Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) has been widely accepted to be a safe, accurate, prompt and inexpensive procedure for diagnosis of both neoplastic and infectious diseases in adult and pediatric populations. Despite its value for diagnosis, FNAC is underutilized in resource limited countries. We reviewed the utilization of FNAC after it was introduced at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH). Methods A retrospective review of all FNAC performed at KCH laboratory during the period of January 2012 to July 2014 was conducted using an electronic database from KCH laboratory. We evaluated factors associated with a diagnostic sample using multivariate logistic regression model. Results 750 FNAC were reviewed from 722 patients: 56.9% were adults >15 years and 54% were female. The number of FNAC increased annually from 56 (2012) to 379 (2013) to 315 (up to July 2014). Of 750 FNAC, 56.4% were performed by non-pathologists. The most common sites were lymph nodes (38.1%), abdomen (25.8%), breast (16.3%), and head & neck (15.7%). Most of the samples (77.6%) were diagnostic. FNAC was more likely to be diagnostic if performed by pathologists versus non-pathologists (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.20–2.64), in 2013 compared to 2012 (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.05–3.56), or performed on a deep lesion versus a subcutaneous lesion (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.15–2.5), or if samples were taken from the head and neck (OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.39–4.39), and abdomen (OR 2.66, 95%CI1.59–4.42) compared to those from the lymph nodes. The odds of a diagnostic test did not differ significantly according to gender, HIV status, or age groups. Conclusion Most FNACs successfully diagnosed the presence or absence of disease, with substantial improvements over time. However, training for non-pathologists may facilitate more diagnostic results."
https://openalex.org/W2808540863,"The Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) predicts the need for dialysis or transplantation using age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR). The eGFR and ACR have known biological and analytical variability. We examined the effect of biological and analytical variability of eGFR and ACR on the 2-year KFRE predicted kidney failure probabilities using single measure and the average of repeat measures of simulated eGFR and ACR. Previously reported values for coefficient of variation (CV) for ACR and eGFR were used to calculate day to day variability. Variation was also examined with outpatient laboratory data from patients with an eGFR between 15 and 50 mL/min/1.72 m2. A web application was developed to calculate and model day to day variation in risk. The biological and analytical variability related to ACR and eGFR lead to variation in the predicted probability of kidney failure. A male patient age 50, ACR 30 mg/mmol and eGFR 25, had a day to day variation in risk of 7% (KFRE point estimate: 17%, variability range 14% to 21%). The addition of inter laboratory variation due to different instrumentation increased the variability to 9% (KFRE point estimate 17%, variability range 13% to 22%). Averaging of repeated measures of eGFR and ACR significantly decreased the variability (KFRE point estimate 17%, variability range 15% to 19%). These findings were consistent when using outpatient laboratory data which showed that most patients had a KFRE 2-year risk variability of ≤ 5% (79% of patients). Approximately 13% of patients had variability from 5-10% and 8% had variability > 10%. The mean age (SD) of this cohort was 64 (15) years, 36% were females, the mean (SD) eGFR was 32 (10) ml/min/1.73m2 and median (IQR) ACR was 22.7 (110). Biological and analytical variation intrinsic to the eGFR and ACR may lead to a substantial degree of variability that decreases with repeat measures. Use of a web application may help physicians and patients understand individual patient's risk variability and communicate risk (https://mccudden.shinyapps.io/kfre_app/). The web application allows the user to alter age, gender, eGFR, ACR, CV (for both eGFR and ACR) as well as units of measurements for ACR (g/mol versus mg/g)."
https://openalex.org/W2808154967,"A crucial mechanism to the formation of native, fully functional, 3D structures from local secondary structures is unraveled in this study. Through the introduction of various amino acid substitutions at four canonical β-turns in a three-fingered protein, Toxin α from Naja nigricollis, we found that the release of internal entropy to the external environment through the globally synchronized movements of local substructures plays a crucial role. Throughout the folding process, the folding species were saturated with internal entropy so that intermediates accumulated at the equilibrium state. Their relief from the equilibrium state was accomplished by the formation of a critical disulfide bridge, which could guide the synchronized movement of one of the peripheral secondary structure. This secondary structure collided with a core central structure, which flanked another peripheral secondary structure. This collision displaced the internal thermal fluctuations from the first peripheral structure to the second peripheral structure, where the displaced thermal fluctuations were ultimately released as entropy. Two protein folding processes that acted in succession were identified as the means to establish the flow of thermal fluctuations. The first process was the time-consuming assembly process, where stochastic combinations of colliding, native-like, secondary structures provided candidate structures for the folded protein. The second process was the activation process to establish the global mutual relationships of the native protein in the selected candidate. This activation process was initiated and propagated by a positive feedback process between efficient entropy release and well-packed local structures, which moved in synchronization. The molecular mechanism suggested by this experiment was assessed with a well-defined 3D structure of erabutoxin b because one of the turns that played a critical role in folding was shared with erabutoxin b."

https://openalex.org/W2807838115,"According to the principle of horizontal equity, individuals with similar need may have the same possibility of access to health services. The aim of this study is to identify patterns of diagnostic services utilization, in people with, and without chronic disease in Italy.Secondary analysis of data from the national survey on Health and use of health care in Italy, carried out in 2013, including 99,497 participants. Multilevel analysis has been used to study the variables associated to diagnostic services utilization.13.78% of participants have had one diagnostic testing in the four weeks before the interview. In healthy people, utilization of diagnostic testing is reduced in people with low educational level (OR 0.75; 95%CI 0.67-0.84), in housewives (OR 0.66; 95%CI 0.51-0.87), or in those unable to work (OR 0.48; 95%CI 0.26-0.87), while increased in those perceiving a worse health status (up to OR 4.00, 95%CI 2.00-8.01 in very bad health). In people afflicted with chronic disease, access to diagnostic assessment is impaired by educational level (OR 0.69; 95%CI 0.61-0.78) and low household income (OR 0.75; 95%CI 0.58-0.97), while it is increased in the presence of a ticket exemption (OR 1.55, 95%CI 1.42-1.68), and fixed-term occupation (OR2.28, 95%CI 1.31-3.95). Being former-smokers in associated to an increased utilization of services in both groups.Despite a universal and theoretically egalitarian, public, health care system, variations in diagnostic services utilization are still registered in Italy, both in healthy people and those afflicted by chronic diseases, on socio-economic/occupational basis, and self-perceived health status. Moreover, this significant effect of occupation on healthcare utilization, suggests the need for a comprehensive evaluation of economics in occupational health."
https://openalex.org/W2808642814,"Eph/Ephrin signaling pathways are crucial in regulating a large variety of physiological processes during development, such as cell morphology, proliferation, migration and axonal guidance. EphrinA (efn-A) ligands, in particular, can be activated by EphA receptors at cell-cell interfaces and have been proposed to cause reverse signaling via RET receptor tyrosine kinase. Such association has been reported to mediate spinal motor axon navigation, but conservation of the interactive signaling pathway and the molecular mechanism of the interaction are unclear. Here, we found Danio rerio efn-A5b bound to Mus musculus EphA4 with high affinity, revealing structurally and functionally conserved EphA/efn-A signaling. Interestingly, we observed no interaction between efn-A5b and RET from zebrafish, unlike earlier cell-based assays. Their lack of association indicates how complex efn-A signaling is and suggests that there may be other molecules involved in efn-A5-induced RET signaling."
