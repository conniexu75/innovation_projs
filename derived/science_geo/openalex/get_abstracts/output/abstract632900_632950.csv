https://openalex.org/W2946298400,"Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a promising strategy for the development of new treatments for inflammatory diseases. MCC950 is a potent and specific small-molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 pathway, but its molecular target is not defined. Here, we show that MCC950 directly interacts with the Walker B motif within the NLRP3 NACHT domain, thereby blocking ATP hydrolysis and inhibiting NLRP3 activation and inflammasome formation."

The molecule sulfonylurea MCC950 is a NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor with potential clinical utility. However, the mechanism of action of MCC950 remains unknown. Here, we characterize the mechanism of action of MCC950 in both wild-type and autoinflammatory-related NLRP3 mutants, and demonstrate that MCC950 closes the 'open' conformation of active NLRP3."
https://openalex.org/W2945711076,"An aged circulatory environment can activate microglia, reduce neural precursor cell activity and impair cognition in mice. We hypothesized that brain endothelial cells (BECs) mediate at least some of these effects. We observe that BECs in the aged mouse hippocampus express an inflammatory transcriptional profile with focal upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), a protein that facilitates vascular-immune cell interactions. Concomitantly, levels of the shed, soluble form of VCAM1 are prominently increased in the plasma of aged humans and mice, and their plasma is sufficient to increase VCAM1 expression in cultured BECs and the hippocampi of young mice. Systemic administration of anti-VCAM1 antibody or genetic ablation of Vcam1 in BECs counteracts the detrimental effects of plasma from aged individuals on young brains and reverses aging aspects, including microglial reactivity and cognitive deficits, in the brains of aged mice. Together, these findings establish brain endothelial VCAM1 at the blood-brain barrier as a possible target to treat age-related neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2949490462,"Ontogeny describes the emergence of complex multicellular organisms from single totipotent cells. This field is particularly challenging in mammals, owing to the indeterminate relationship between self-renewal and differentiation, variation in progenitor field sizes, and internal gestation in these animals. Here we present a flexible, high-information, multi-channel molecular recorder with a single-cell readout and apply it as an evolving lineage tracer to assemble mouse cell-fate maps from fertilization through gastrulation. By combining lineage information with single-cell RNA sequencing profiles, we recapitulate canonical developmental relationships between different tissue types and reveal the nearly complete transcriptional convergence of endodermal cells of extra-embryonic and embryonic origins. Finally, we apply our cell-fate maps to estimate the number of embryonic progenitor cells and their degree of asymmetric partitioning during specification. Our approach enables massively parallel, high-resolution recording of lineage and other information in mammalian systems, which will facilitate the construction of a quantitative framework for understanding developmental processes."
https://openalex.org/W2943858683,"To maximize a desired product, metabolic engineers typically express enzymes to high, constant levels. Yet, permanent pathway activation can have undesirable consequences including competition with essential pathways and accumulation of toxic intermediates. Faced with similar challenges, natural metabolic systems compartmentalize enzymes into organelles or post-translationally induce activity under certain conditions. Here we report that optogenetic control can be used to extend compartmentalization and dynamic control to engineered metabolisms in yeast. We describe a suite of optogenetic tools to trigger assembly and disassembly of metabolically active enzyme clusters. Using the deoxyviolacein biosynthesis pathway as a model system, we find that light-switchable clustering can enhance product formation six-fold and product specificity 18-fold by decreasing the concentration of intermediate metabolites and reducing flux through competing pathways. Inducible compartmentalization of enzymes into synthetic organelles can thus be used to control engineered metabolic pathways, limit intermediates and favor the formation of desired products. Optogenetically controlling the assembly of enzyme clusters enhances product formation and specificity during deoxyviolacein biosynthesis by decreasing concentrations of intermediate metabolites and reducing flux through competing pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2946246317,"The GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, it is not known which dysregulated molecular pathways are primarily responsible for disease initiation or progression. We established an inducible mouse model of poly(GR) toxicity in which (GR)80 gradually accumulates in cortical excitatory neurons. Low-level poly(GR) expression induced FTD/ALS-associated synaptic dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities, as well as age-dependent neuronal cell loss, microgliosis and DNA damage, probably caused in part by early defects in mitochondrial function. Poly(GR) bound preferentially to the mitochondrial complex V component ATP5A1 and enhanced its ubiquitination and degradation, consistent with reduced ATP5A1 protein level in both (GR)80 mouse neurons and patient brains. Moreover, inducing ectopic Atp5a1 expression in poly(GR)-expressing neurons or reducing poly(GR) level in adult mice after disease onset rescued poly(GR)-induced neurotoxicity. Thus, poly(GR)-induced mitochondrial defects are a major driver of disease initiation in C9ORF72-related ALS/FTD. The authors generated a mouse model of C9ORF72-related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia based on dipeptide repeat proteins and report that defects in mitochondria may contribute to disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2945779855,"Deficiency in the deubiquitinating enzyme A20 causes severe inflammation in mice, and impaired A20 function is associated with human inflammatory diseases. A20 has been implicated in negatively regulating NF-κB signalling, cell death and inflammasome activation; however, the mechanisms by which A20 inhibits inflammation in vivo remain poorly understood. Genetic studies in mice revealed that its deubiquitinase activity is not essential for A20 anti-inflammatory function. Here we show that A20 prevents inflammasome-dependent arthritis by inhibiting macrophage necroptosis and that this function depends on its zinc finger 7 (ZnF7). We provide genetic evidence that RIPK1 kinase-dependent, RIPK3-MLKL-mediated necroptosis drives inflammasome activation in A20-deficient macrophages and causes inflammatory arthritis in mice. Single-cell imaging revealed that RIPK3-dependent death caused inflammasome-dependent IL-1β release from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated A20-deficient macrophages. Importantly, mutation of the A20 ZnF7 ubiquitin binding domain caused arthritis in mice, arguing that ZnF7-dependent inhibition of necroptosis is critical for A20 anti-inflammatory function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2945883730,"Developmental programs that generate the astonishing neuronal diversity of the nervous system are not completely understood and thus present a major challenge for clinical applications of guided cell differentiation strategies. Using direct neuronal programming of embryonic stem cells, we found that two main vertebrate proneural factors, Ascl1 and neurogenin 2 (Neurog2), induce different neuronal fates by binding to largely different sets of genomic sites. Their divergent binding patterns are not determined by the previous chromatin state, but are distinguished by enrichment of specific E-box sequences that reflect the binding preferences of the DNA-binding domains. The divergent Ascl1 and Neurog2 binding patterns result in distinct chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity profiles that differentially shape the binding of downstream transcription factors during neuronal differentiation. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how transcription factors constrain terminal cell fates, and it delineates the importance of choosing the right proneural factor in neuronal reprogramming strategies. Aydin et al. show that the proneural factors Ascl1 and Neurog2 bind to largely non-overlapping sites in the genome, establishing distinct chromatin landscapes that shape the activity of downstream factors during neuronal fate specification."
https://openalex.org/W2917146490,"The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a period when ongoing brain development coincides with a substantially increased risk of psychiatric disorders. The developmental brain changes accounting for this emergent psychiatric symptomatology remain obscure. Capitalizing on a unique longitudinal dataset that includes in vivo myelin-sensitive magnetization transfer (MT) MRI scans, we show that this developmental period is characterized by brain-wide growth in MT trajectories within both gray matter and adjacent juxtacortical white matter. In this healthy population, the expression of common developmental traits, namely compulsivity and impulsivity, is tied to a reduced growth of these MT trajectories in frontostriatal regions. This reduction is most marked in dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal regions for compulsivity and in lateral and medial prefrontal regions for impulsivity. These findings highlight that psychiatric traits of compulsivity and impulsivity are linked to regionally specific reductions in myelin-related growth in late adolescent brain development. Ziegler, Hauser et al. report brain-wide, myelin-related microstructural growth from adolescence to adulthood and show that this longitudinal growth is reduced in the presence of compulsivity and impulsivity traits."

It blocks androgen binding to the AR, AR nuclear translocation, and AR-mediated DNA binding. Unfortunately, a considerable proportion of tumors eventually develop resistance during the treatment. The molecular mechanisms underlying enzalutamide resistance are not completely understood. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressor complex 2, has been proposed as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer (PCa). With the goal to test whether EZH2 also plays a critical role in acquisition of enzalutamide resistance in CRPC, here we examined whether EZH2 inhibition/depletion enhances the efficacy of enzalutamide in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. We show that combining the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 with enzalutamide synergistically inhibits cell proliferation and colony formation and promotes apoptosis in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. EZH2 depletion also overcomes enzalutamide resistance in both cultured cells and xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, we found that EZH2 directly binds to the promoter of prostate-specific antigen and inhibits its expression in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. In agreement, bioinformatics analysis of clinical RNA sequencing data involving GSEA indicated a strong correlation between AR and EZH2 gene expression during PCa progression.

Because androgen is essential for PCa development, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay of treatment of advanced PCa. Despite the initial response to ADT, most patients experience disease relapse, and the disease enters a stage called castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (2Donkena K.V. Yuan H. Young C.Y. Recent advances in understanding hormonal therapy resistant prostate cancer.Curr.

In addition to its canonical roles in transcriptional silence, several studies have also identified a PRC2-indenpdent function of EZH2 in transcription activation. For example, EZH2 has been implicated in transcriptional activation of NOTCH1, NF-κB target genes, the genes that are regulated by the estrogen receptor, and Wnt signaling transcription factors in breast cancer (11Shi B.

Moreover, EZH2 binds to the β-catenin transcriptional complex and specifically enhances Wnt target genes transactivation in colon cancer independent of its methyltransferase activity (14Jung H.-Y.

EZH2 also functions as a transcriptional coactivator with AR in CRPC (15Xu K. Wu Z.J. Groner A.C. He H.H. Cai C. Lis R.T. Wu X. Stack E.C. Loda M. Liu T. Xu H. Cato L. Thornton J.E. Gregory R.I. Morrissey C. et al.EZH2 oncogenic activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells is polycomb-independent.Science. 2012; 338 (23239736): 1465-146910.1126/science.1227604Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the functional switch from a transcription silencer to an activator requires S21 phosphorylation of EZH2 by Akt, and activation of AR depends on EZH2 methyltransferase activity. In addition to its known roles in histone modification and transcriptional regulation, EZH2 also methylates a number of nonhistone proteins and modulates their functions. For example, EZH2 can methylate STAT3, GATA4, and Jarid2, to regulate their transcriptional activities (16Kim E. Kim M. Woo D.-H. Shin Y. Shin J. Chang N. Oh Y.T. Kim H. Rheey J. Nakano I. Lee C.

These findings have highlighted an important role of EZH2 in cancer development and progression. However, the mechanisms governing the oncogenic role of EZH2 in enzalutamide-resistant CRPC remain to be elucidated. In this study, we aim to explore the role of EZH2 in acquisition of drug resistance in PCa. We show here that EZH2 binding to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promotor suppresses its transcription independent of AR. Accordingly, we show that EZH2 inhibition overcomes enzalutamide resistance, thus enhancing its efficacy in CRPC. To probe the potential role of EZH2 in development of chemotherapy resistance in CRPC, we evaluated the possible alteration of EZH2 levels in PCa cells by IB analysis. As indicated, the protein levels of EZH2 were slightly increased, and the levels of AR were clearly elevated in MR49F and C4-2R cells compared with those in LNCaP and C4-2 cells, respectively (Fig. 1A). Fusions of the androgen-regulated gene TMPRSS2 to the oncogenic ETS transcription factor ERG occur in 40–80% of prostate cancers (21Clark J. Merson S. Jhavar S. Flohr P. Edwards S. Foster C.S. Eeles R. Martin F.L. Phillips D.H. Crundwell M. Christmas T. Thompson A. Fisher C. Kovacs G. Cooper C.S. Diversity of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcripts in the human prostate.Oncogene. 2007; 26 (17043636): 2667-267310.1038/sj.onc.1210070Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We found that ERG is significantly elevated in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells compared with that of enzalutamide-sensitive counterparts. Intriguingly, the levels of PSA were dramatically reduced in enzalutamide-resistant cells than those in sensitive cells. To distinguish that the accumulation of EZH2 and AR is due to increased transcription or translation, we also compared mRNA levels of EZH2 and AR in four PCa cell lines (Fig. S1A). We found that mRNA levels of AR were higher in MR49F and C4-2R cells than those in LNCaP and C4-2 cells, consistent with the protein levels. The mRNA levels of EZH2 of MR49F and C4-2R cells were actually lower than those of LNCaP and C4-2 cells, which are consistent with our RNA-seq results (Fig. S1, B and C), indicating that additional post-translation mechanisms likely contribute to EZH2 elevation during acquisition of enzalutamide resistance. To further explore the effects of EZH2 on acquisition of enzalutamide resistance, we treated enzalutamide-resistance cells with EZH2 inhibitor GSK126, an SAM competitive binder of EZH2 that inhibits its histone methyltransferase activity and induces a loss of H3K27 trimethylation without affecting the levels of total histone H3 or other PRC2 components (22McCabe M.T. Ott H.M. Ganji G. Korenchuk S. Thompson C. Van Aller G.S. Liu Y. Graves A.P. Della Pietra 3rd, A. Diaz E. LaFrance L.V. Mellinger M. Duquenne C. Tian X. Kruger R.G. et al.EZH2 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for lymphoma with EZH2-activating mutations.Nature. 2012; 492 (23051747): 108-11210.1038/nature11606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). We investigated whether GSK126 and enzalutamide act synergistically to inhibit the growth of enzalutamide-resistant cells. First, C4-2R, MR49F, and 22RV1 cells were treated with GSK126 and/or enzalutamide and subjected to IB to follow cell death and proliferation. Increased levels of apoptotic markers (cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3) and reduced levels of proliferation marker (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) indicated that combination treatment of GSK126 and enzalutamide led to a significantly increased cellular apoptosis compared with GSK126 or enzalutamide treatment alone (Fig. 1B). Next, combination treatment of GSK126 and enzalutamide showed a much stronger inhibitory effect on both cell proliferation and colony formation in C4-2R, MR49F, and 22RV1 cells (Fig. 1, C–F). To further confirm the synergistic effect of two drugs, cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. There was no apparent apoptosis induced by enzalutamide treatment alone and a mild increase in early apoptosis induced by GSK126 treatment alone. However, we observed significantly increased populations of late apoptosis upon combination treatment compared with the mono treatment (Fig. 1G). Moreover, we used the Chou–Talalay method to examine the combination index of GSK126 and enzalutamide as well. The combination index values are 0.744 and 0.85 in C4-2R and 22RV1, respectively, which means significant synergic effects when both drugs are administrated together (Fig. S1D). To address potential off-target effect associated with pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2, we depleted EZH2 with lentivirus-encoded shRNA in C4-2R and 22RV1 cells (Fig. 2A). Knockdown of EZH2 suppressed the growth of these cells, which was more significant following combinatory treatment with enzalutamide (Fig. 2B). Combinatory treatment with enzalutamide also significantly inhibited colony formation in these two cell lines (Fig. 2C). To further confirm the findings of synergic effects of combinatory treatment on cell apoptosis, we treated cells (depleted with or without EZH2) with enzalutamide, followed by IB against cleaved PARP. As shown in Fig. 2D, enzalutamide treatment dramatically increased apoptosis in cells with EZH2 depletion. In a further step, we then treated the EZH2 knockdown cells with GSK126 to determine whether there are further effects on death and proliferation, in the presence and absence of enzalutamide. As shown in Fig. S1E, GSK126 treatment did not induce more cleaved PARP and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in the presence and absence of enzalutamide, which indicates there are no further effects of GSK126 on EZH2 knockdown cells. Altogether, these results demonstrate that EZH2 inhibition can resensitize the resistant cells toward enzalutamide, suggesting a strong synergistic effect between GSK126 and enzalutamide. To assess this combinatory effect in vivo, we next tested the effect of combination treatment in a 22RV1-derived xenograft mouse model. To rule out the potential off-target effect of GSK126 on tumor suppression in vivo, a more stable genetic approach (EZH2 shRNA) was used. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), EZH2 depletion slightly decreased tumor volumes, whereas administration of enzalutamide showed synergistic effects, indicating that knockdown of EZH2 overcame enzalutamide resistance and restored sensitivity to enzalutamide. Although both wet weights and sizes of the tumors were reduced with EZH2 knockdown alone or monotherapy of enzalutamide, the effect was much more significant with EZH2 depletion plus enzalutamide treatment (Fig. 3, C and D). It is important to point out that the combination treatment did not affect animal weights (Fig. 3E). Histologically, H&E staining of tumors from sh-Ctl without treatment showed numerous mitotic cells, suggesting that cell proliferation was active (Fig. 3F). However, tumors derived from EZH2 knockdown cells plus treatment with enzalutamide showed increased numbers of apoptotic bodies with condensed cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei compared with other groups. To determine whether EZH2 knockdown alone or in combination with enzalutamide represses tumor proliferation and promotes apoptosis, tumor slices were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining for Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 3, G and H). A significant increase in cleaved caspase 3-positive cells, along with a reduction in Ki67-positive cells, was observed after combination treatment, indicating a strong induction of cell apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. To further validate that EZH2 depletion sensitizes the tumors to enzalutamide, we conducted another study with xenograft tumors derived from C4-2R cells. Consistent with previous findings, EZH2 depletion plus enzalutamide inhibited the tumor growth significantly (Fig. S2, A–E). A remarkable increase in the number of apoptotic bodies was also observed upon treatment with enzalutamide (Fig. S2F). Immunostaining for Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3 also confirmed that the tumors after enzalutamide therapy had a significant reduction in overall proliferation and a significant increase in apoptosis (Fig. S2, G–J). In summary, these results, consistent with cell-based studies, suggest that GSK126 and enzalutamide can act synergistically both in vitro and in vivo, providing a novel and promising therapeutic option to treat CRPC patients. To investigate the mechanism underlying the observed synergistic effect, C4-2R, MR49F, and 22RV1 cells were treated with GSK126, enzalutamide, or GSK126 plus enzalutamide, followed by IB. As indicated, the protein levels of EZH2, AR, PSA, and ERG were all remarkably reduced with combination treatment compared with monotherapy (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that both EZH2 and AR signal pathway are crucial to the proliferation of enzalutamide-resistant cells. Then we asked whether AR signaling pathway is affected by EZH2 in enzalutamide-resistant cells. As described above, the protein levels of both EZH2 and AR were elevated in MR49F and C4-2R compared with those in their enzalutamide-sensitive parental cells (Fig. 1A). However, we always detected much lower levels of PSA protein in enzalutamide-resistant cells, suggesting that AR pathway is largely inactive in enzalutamide-resistant cells (Fig. 1A). Next, we attempted to investigate the mechanisms by which EZH2 affects AR signaling in enzalutamide-resistant cells. A recent study reported that EZH2 as a transcriptional activator can directly induces AR gene expression in a polycomb- and methylation-independent manner (23Kim J. Lee Y. Lu X. Song B. Fong K.-W. Cao Q. Licht J.D. Zhao J.C. Yu J. Polycomb- and methylation-independent roles of EZH2 as a transcription activator.Cell Rep. 2018; 25 (30517868): 2808-282010.1016/j.celrep.2018.11.035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To investigate whether EZH2 directly occupies the AR promoter region, EZH2 ChIP assays were performed in C4-2R and MR49F cells. Apparent EZH2 occupancy at AR promoter was observed in both cell lines (Fig. 4B). Moreover, ChIP-qPCR assays were performed on reported AR target genes, such as PSA and TMPRSS2. EZH2 occupancy on PSA and TMPRSS2 promoters was observed as well (Fig. 4B). To further investigate the roles of EZH2 on AR, PSA and TMPRSS2 transcription, H3K27me3 ChIP-qPCR assays were performed. Again, occupancy of H3K27me3 at AR, PSA, and TMPRSS2 promoter regions were detected (Fig. 4C). To further demonstrate that EZH2 regulates AR, PSA, and TMPRSS2 transcription, GSK126 was used to treat enzalutamide-resistant cells with increasing doses (5, 10, and 15 μm). As indicated, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that the AR mRNA levels slightly increased after treatment. Interestingly, the levels of PSA and TMPRSS2 mRNA increased significantly upon GSK126 treatment (Fig. 4D). Meanwhile, GSK126 treatment increased the expression of another AR-target gene FKBP5 in MR49F and 22RV1 cells. As positive controls, GSK126 treatment restored expression of reported EZH2 target genes, such as SLIT2 and CNR1. Interestingly, EZH2 mRNA expression was up-regulated to some extent upon GSK126 treatment. These results suggest that EZH2 largely remains as an epigenetic silencer on AR signaling pathway in enzalutamide-resistant cells. Furthermore, IB analysis demonstrated that PSA protein levels increased slightly upon GSK126 treatment, whereas the levels of AR and ERG slightly decreased (Fig. 4A). In agreement, knockdown of EZH2 in C4-2R and 22RV1 cells increased the levels of PSA and decreased the levels of AR and ERG (Fig. 4E). To further validate that EZH2 suppresses the transcription of PSA, we performed reporter gene assays with PSA gene enhancer and promoter-linked luciferase. As indicated, overexpression of EZH2 in 293T cells led to reduced luciferase activity, suggesting that EZH2 indeed down-regulates the PSA expression (Fig. 4F). Moreover, PSA depletion alone can suppress proliferation of MR49F and C4-2R cells, which can be enhanced by GSK126 treatment (Fig. 4, G and H). A previous study has demonstrated that EZH2 directly interacts with AR to modulate AR function (24Liu Q. Wang G. Li Q. Jiang W. Kim J.S. Wang R. Zhu S. Wang X. Yan L. Yi Y. Zhang L. Meng Q. Li C. Zhao D. Qiao Y. et al.Polycomb group proteins EZH2 and EED directly regulate androgen receptor in advanced prostate cancer.Int. J. Cancer. 2019; (in press)Google Scholar). Therefore, we then examined the role of EZH2/AR complex in regulating enzalutamide-resistance in CRPC. In agreement, EZH2 directly interacts with AR in both sensitive and resistant cells. Intriguingly, stronger interaction was found in enzalutamide-resistant cells than that in enzalutamide-sensitive cells. These results indicate that the EZH2–AR complex at least partially contributes to regulation of enzalutamide resistance in CRPC (Fig. S2K). This result indicates that PSA pathway still works in enzalutamide-resistant PCa. In support, EZH2 inhibition elevated the level of PSA, resulting in a synergic effect of inhibition of EZH2 and PSA depletion. In conclusion, our data support the notion that EZH2 plays an epigenetic silence role on PSA expression in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. To determine the clinical relevance of our findings, we analyzed expression levels of AR and EZH2 in 497 tumors from TCGA database. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B) expression levels of both EZH2 and AR were increased in tumors compared with adjacent normal tissues. Next, we further explored the correlation between the levels of EZH2 and AR and observed that there was a strong correlation between the levels of these two genes in tumors (r = 0.5675) but not of those in normal tissues (r = 0.1806) (Fig. 5C). Next, we compared expression levels of EZH2 and AR in enzalutamide-sensitive versus -resistant cell lines. As indicated in Fig. S1B, the levels of AR were dramatically increased in enzalutamide-resistant cells compared with enzalutamide-sensitive cells (C4-2 versus C4-2R and LNCaP versus MR49F). We did not observe significant changes for transcription levels of EZH2 in cells with different sensitivities to enzalutamide (Fig. S1C). To further investigate potential correlations among EZH2, AR, and ADT, we analyzed expression levels of these two genes in seven pairs of PCa patients pre- and post-ADT (GSE48403). As shown in Fig. 5 (D and E), we found that expression levels of EZH2, but not AR, were significantly suppressed upon ADT. Finally, AR expression was significantly elevated in high risk PCa patients (Gleason score = 10). Consistently, EZH2 expression was also gradually increased with disease progression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 5, F and G). These data indicate that EZH2 expression correlates with that of AR, and such a correlation is associated with disease progression. To explore signaling pathway(s) involved in the disease progression associated with EZH2 and AR, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. As indicated, metastasis pathway was found to be activated upon up-regulation of both EZH2 (rank 3) and AR (rank 22) (Fig. 6, A and B, and Fig. S1, F and G). To further determine genes that contribute to enzalutamide resistance, we then overlapped RNA-seq data from both cell lines, including enzalutamide-sensitive and -resistant cells, and human patient tumors. As illustrated in Fig. 6 (C and D), 38 metastasis-related genes were found to correlate with increase of both AR and EZH2 expression (Table S2). To further validate our findings, we then performed IB against markers for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that the levels of E-cadherin were decreased in enzalutamide-resistant cells compared with those in enzalutamide-sensitive cells. At the same time, the levels of N-cadherin and vimentin were dramatically increased in MR49F and C4-2R cells compared with LNCaP and C4-2 cells (Fig. 6E). Meanwhile, Snail, an important transcription factor driving EMT, was also dramatically up-regulated in enzalutamide-resistant cells compared with their enzalutamide-sensitive counterparts. These data suggest that expression levels of both AR and EZH2 correlate with metastasis, which contributes to enzalutamide resistance in PCa. EZH2 was first reported to be elevated in hormone-refractory, metastatic PCa. Although its depletion inhibits cell proliferation, overexpression of EZH2 leads to transcription repression of a specific set of genes in prostate cells. Furthermore, a high expression of EZH2 correlates to a poor prognosis of PCa. Based on these findings, it was concluded that EZH2 might be a good diagnostic marker to distinguish indolent PCa from those at high risk of lethal progression (25Varambally S. Dhanasekaran S.M.

These Aβ species can generally form amyloid plaques implicated in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer disease (AD), but therapies designed to reduce plaque load have not demonstrated clinical efficacy. Recent evidence implicates amyloid oligomers in AD neuropathology, but the precise mechanisms are uncertain. We examined the mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction from HMW-Aβ1-42 exposure by measuring membrane integrity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, membrane lipid peroxidation, membrane fluidity, intracellular calcium regulation, passive membrane electrophysiological properties, and long-term potentiation (LTP). HMW-Aβ1-42 disturbed membrane integrity by inducing ROS generation and lipid peroxidation, resulting in decreased membrane fluidity, intracellular calcium dysregulation, depolarization, and impaired LTP. The damaging effects of HMW-Aβ1-42 were significantly greater than those of LMW-Aβ1-42. Therapeutic reduction of HMW-Aβ1-42 may prevent AD progression by ameliorating direct neuronal membrane damage.-Yasumoto, T., Takamura, Y., Tsuji, M., Watanabe-Nakayama, T., Imamura, K., Inoue, H., Nakamura, S., Inoue, T., Kimura, A., Yano, S., Nishijo, H., Kiuchi, Y., Teplow, D.

To dissect MAP7-mediated regulation of kinesin-driven transport, we examined its effects on the motility and force generation of single and teams of full-length kinesin-1 motors. We find that MAP7 does not alter the force exerted by a single kinesin-1 motor, but instead increases its binding rate to the microtubule.

https://openalex.org/W2946067182,"Enzymes that act on multiple substrates are common in biology but pose unique challenges as therapeutic targets. The metalloprotease insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) modulates blood glucose levels by cleaving insulin, a hormone that promotes glucose clearance. However, IDE also degrades glucagon, a hormone that elevates glucose levels and opposes the effect of insulin. IDE inhibitors to treat diabetes, therefore, should prevent IDE-mediated insulin degradation, but not glucagon degradation, in contrast with traditional modes of enzyme inhibition. Using a high-throughput screen for non-active-site ligands, we discovered potent and highly specific small-molecule inhibitors that alter IDE's substrate selectivity. X-ray co-crystal structures, including an IDE-ligand-glucagon ternary complex, revealed substrate-dependent interactions that enable these inhibitors to potently block insulin binding while allowing glucagon cleavage, even at saturating inhibitor concentrations. These findings suggest a path for developing IDE-targeting therapeutics, and offer a blueprint for modulating other enzymes in a substrate-selective manner to unlock their therapeutic potential."

There is limited data on causes and trends of admission and death among patients on the medical wards. Understanding the major drivers of morbidity and mortality would help inform health systems improvements. We determined the causes and trends of admission and mortality among patients admitted to Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. Methods and results The medical record data base of patients admitted to Mulago Hospital adult medical wards from January 2011 to December 2014 were queried. A detailed history, physical examination and investigations were completed to confirm the diagnosis and identify comorbidities. Any histopathologic diagnoses were made by hematoxylin and eosin tissue staining. We identified the 10 commonest causes of hospitalization, and used Poisson regression to generate annual percentage change to describe the trends in causes of hospitalization. Survival was calculated from the date of admission to the date of death or date of discharge. Cox survival analysis was used to identify factors associate with in-hospital mortality. We used a statistical significance level of p<0.05. A total of 50,624 patients were hospitalized with a median age of 38 (range 13–122) years and 51.7% females. Majority of patients (72%) had an NCD condition as the primary reason for admission. Specific leading causes of morbidity were HIV/AIDS in 30% patients, hypertension in 14%, tuberculosis (TB) in 12%), non-TB pneumonia in11%) and heart failure in 9.3%. There was decline in the proportion of hospitalization due to malaria, TB and pneumonia with an annual percentage change (apc) of -20% to -6% (all p<0.03) with an increase in proportions of admissions due to chronic kidney disease, hypertension, stroke and cancer, with apc 13.4% to 24%(p<0.001). Overall, 8,637(17.1%) died during hospitalization with the highest case fatality rates from non-TB pneumonia (28.8%), TB (27.1%), stroke (26.8%), cancer (26.1%) and HIV/AIDS (25%). HIV-status, age above 50yrs and being male were associated with increased risk of death among patients with infections. Conclusion Admissions and case fatality rates for both infectious and non-infectious diseases were high, with declining trends in infectious diseases and a rising trend in NCDs. Health care systems in sub-Saharan region need to prepare to deal with dual burden of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2945870184,"Theoretical models of time perception suggest a simple bottom-up relationship between physiological arousal and perceived duration. Increases in physiological arousal lengthen the perceived duration of events whereas decreases in physiological arousal reduce them. Whilst this relationship has been demonstrated for highly arousing negatively valenced stimuli, it has not been demonstrated for other classes of distorting stimuli (e.g. positively valenced or low arousal stimuli). The current study tested the effect of valence (positive and negative) and arousal level (high and low) on the relationship between physiological arousal and perceived duration. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) activity was measured during a verbal estimation task in which participants judged the duration of high and low arousal, positive, negative and neutrally valenced IAPS images. SNS and PSNS activity were indexed by measuring Pre-Ejection Period (PEP) and High Frequency Heart-rate Variability (HF-HRV) respectively. SNS reactivity was predicative of perceived duration, but only for high arousal negatively valenced stimuli, with decreases in PEP being associated with longer duration estimates. SNS and PSNS activity was not predictive of perceived duration for the low arousal negative stimuli or the low and high arousal positive stimuli. We therefore propose a new model suggesting that emotional distortions to time result from a combination of bottom-up (physiological arousal) and top-down (threat detection) factors."

The photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX is metabolized from 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) intracellularly, and PDD/PDT using 5-ALA have been approved in dermatologic malignancies and gliomas. However, the molecular mechanism that defines the efficacy of PDD/PDT is unknown. In this study, we analyzed the functions of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in PDD using 5-ALA. Most of the human gastrointestinal cancer line cells examined showed a homogenous staining pattern with 5-ALA, except for the pancreatic cancer line PANC-1, which showed heterogeneous staining. To analyze this heterogeneous staining pattern, single cell clones were established from PANC-1 cells and the expression of ABC transporters was assessed. Among the ABC transporter genes examined, ABCG2 showed an inverse correlation with the rate of 5-ALA-positive staining. PANC-1 clone #2 cells showed the highest level of ABCG2 expression and the lowest level of 5-ALA staining, with only a 0.6% positive rate. Knockdown of the ABCG2 gene by small interfering RNAs increased the positive rate of 5-ALA staining in PANC-1 wild-type and clone cells. Interestingly, PANC-1 clone #2 cells showed the high sphere-forming ability and tumor-formation ability, indicating that the cells contained high numbers of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Knockdown or inhibition of ABCG2 increased the rate of 5-ALA staining, but did not decrease sphere-forming ability. These results indicate that gastrointestinal cancer cell lines expressing high levels of ABCG2 are enriched with CSCs and show low rates of 5-ALA staining, but 5-ALA staining rates can be improved by inhibition of ABCG2."

Data was collected on 528 households by using simple random sampling method. Trained data collectors gathered the data using a pre-tested and structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. To determine the independent predictors of household's satisfaction to CBHI, a cut point of p values < 0.05 were used.This study showed that more than half (54.7%) of the households were satisfied with the CBHI scheme. Satisfaction to CBHI was positively associated with adequate knowledge of CBHI benefit packages (AOR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.55-3.38), type of health facility visit (AOR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.09-3.39), laboratory service provision (AOR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.15-373) and length of enrollment (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.01-2.32).Household's satisfaction to CBHI scheme was moderate. Modifiable factors, including adequate knowledge of CBHI benefit packages, type of health facility visit, laboratory service provision, and length of enrollment were independent determinants of satisfaction. In order to augment enrollee's satisfaction to CBHI, efforts should be given to improving their knowledge of CBHI benefit packages through education and information campaigns.

In this study, we investigated endothelial barrier characteristics of ECFCs, whether vitamin D supports cell-cell adhesion and barrier integrity, and how it affects ECFC mobilization and actin dynamics. Although ECFC barrier was disrupted under inflammatory conditions, this effect was rescued by vitamin D treatment, leading to higher stability of an ECFC monolayer. Furthermore, vitamin D enhanced ECFC mobilization toward directional migration. In addition, immunocytochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunoblotting analysis showed that vitamin D increased endothelial interconnections through vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) junctions and by impacting cell dynamics through cofilin and VE-cadherin phosphorylation. Our results suggest that vitamin D treatment efficiently counteracts inflammation in an ECFC monolayer, resulting in higher ECFC barrier integrity.

The inclusion criteria for this study were Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI of the liver and histopathological evaluation of fibrotic and inflammatory changes. T1-weighted VIBE sequences of the liver with fat suppression were evaluated to determine the relative signal change (RE) between native and hepatobiliary phase (20min). In simple and multiple linear regression analyses, the influence of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis (Ishak score) and the histopathological degree of hepatitis (Modified Hepatic Activity Index, mHAI) on RE were evaluated.RE decreased significantly with increasing liver fibrosis/cirrhosis (p < 0.001) and inflammation (mHAI, p = 0.004). In particular, a correlation between RE and periportal or periseptal boundary zone hepatitis (moth feeding necrosis, mHAI A, p = 0.001) and portal inflammation (mHAI D, p < 0.001) was observed. In multiple linear regression analysis, both the degree of inflammation and the degree of fibrosis were significant predictors for RE (p < 0.01).The results of this study suggest that the MR-based hepatic enhancement index RE is not only influenced by the degree of fibrosis, but also by the degree of inflammation."

In this study, samples were obtained from zebrafish at different developmental stages. The stages that were chosen were 3/4, 4/5, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). Each sample included fifty embryos. The samples were analysed using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). Principle component analysis (PCA) was applied to get an overview of the data and orthogonal projection to latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was utilised to discriminate between the developmental stages. In this way, changes in metabolite profiles during vertebrate development could be identified. Using a GC-TOF-MS metabolomics approach it was found that nucleotides and metabolic fuel (glucose) were elevated at early stages of embryogenesis, whereas at later stages amino acids and intermediates in the Krebs cycle were abundant. This agrees with zebrafish developmental biology, as organs such as the liver and pancreas develop at later stages. Thus, metabolomics of zebrafish embryos offers a unique opportunity to investigate large scale changes in metabolic processes during important developmental stages in vertebrate development. In terms of stability of the metabolic profile and viability of the embryos, it was concluded at 72 hpf was a suitable time point for the use of zebrafish as a model system in numerous scientific applications."
https://openalex.org/W2946812026,"Hyperandrogenism is a risk factor of cerebrovascular diseases as androgens can alter markedly the regulation of cerebrovascular tone. We examined the combined impact of androgen excess and vitamin D deficiency (VDD), a common co-morbidity in hyperandrogenic disorders, on remodeling and testosterone-induced vascular responses of anterior cerebral arteries (ACA) in order to evaluate the interplay between androgens and VDD in the cerebral vasculature. Male and female Wistar rats were either fed with vitamin D deficient or vitamin D supplemented diet. Half of the female animals from both groups received transdermal testosterone treatment. After 8 weeks, vessel lumen, wall thickness and testosterone-induced vascular tone of isolated ACA were determined using pressure microangiometry and histological examination. Androgen receptor protein expression in the wall of cerebral arteries was examined using immunohistochemistry. In female rats only combined VDD and testosterone treatment decreased the lumen and increased the wall thickness of ACA. In males, however VDD by itself was able to decrease the lumen and increase the wall thickness. Vascular reactivity showed similar alterations: in females, testosterone constricted the ACA only after combined VDD and hyperandrogenism, whereas in males VDD resulted in increased testosterone-induced contractions in spite of decreased androgen receptor expression. In conclusion, a marked interplay between hyperandrogenism and VDD results in inward remodeling and enhanced testosterone-induced constrictions of cerebral arteries, which might compromise the cerebral circulation and thus, increase the risk of stroke in the long term. In addition, the early cerebrovascular manifestation of VDD appears to require androgen excess and thus, depends on gender."

The concentrations of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitors, such as lithium chloride or CHIR99021 trihydrochloride, were found to directly correlate with the development of fruiting bodies in the mushroom forming fungi such as Coprinopsis cinerea and Pleurotus djamor. Sensitive windows to these inhibitors throughout the fungal life cycle were also identified. We suggest the inclusion of GSK-3 inhibitors in the cultivation recipes for inhibiting fruiting body formation and regulating mycelium growth. This is the first report of using a GSK-3 inhibitor to suppress fruiting body formation in living fungal mycelium-based materials. It provides an innovative strategy for easy, reliable, and low cost maintenance of materials containing living fungal mycelium."
https://openalex.org/W2945963107,"Although offshore wind energy development (OWED) offers a much-needed renewable energy alternative to fossil fuels, holistic and effective methods for evaluating environmental impacts on wildlife in both space and time have been lacking. The lengthy environmental compliance process, estimated to incur a 7–10 year permitting timeline [1], has been identified as a significant impediment to offshore energy development in U.S. waters. During operation, seabirds can collide and be displaced by turbines. During episodic pre-operation phases, cetaceans are most heavily impacted acoustically by pile driving (and similarly seismic air gun surveys for oil and gas exploration). The varying nature of impacts in space and time leads us to conclude that sites should be selected in space to minimize long-term operational impacts on seabirds, and timing of surveying and construction activities to be conducted in times of the year when sensitive migratory marine mammals are least present. We developed a novel spatiotemporal decision support framework that interactively visualizes tradeoffs between OWED industry profits and wildlife sensitivities, in both space and time. The framework highlights sites on a map that are the most profitable and least sensitive to seabirds. Within the U.S. Mid-Atlantic study area, the New York Call Areas are particularly well optimized for minimal impact on seabirds with maximal profits to OWED. For a given site, pre-operational activities (e.g. pile driving and seismic air gun surveying) are advised by cetacean sensitivity across months of the year that minimize impacts on migratory cetaceans, particularly those of highest conservation concern such as the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena Glacialis). For instance, within optimal sites for the New York Call Area the least impacting months are May and June. Other taxa are certainly affected by OWED and should be incorporated into this framework, but data on their distributions and/or sensitivities is currently less well known. Built with open-source software made publicly available, the authors hope this framework will be extended even more comprehensively into the future as our knowledge on species distributions and OWED sensitivities expands for streamlining environmental compliance."
https://openalex.org/W2944421969,"Map-matching technology is a key and difficult technology in the development of vehicle navigation systems. Only by correctly identifying the road segment on which the vehicle is traveling can the navigation system make the right decision. At the same time, the complexity of the road network structure and a variety of error factors have introduced great challenges to map matching and have attracted the attention of many researchers as well. This paper analyzes various map-matching algorithms, determines that the key to the matching performance is the junction matching, performs an in-depth study on the junction-matching problem, and puts forward the junction decision domain model. The model mainly involves information regarding the width of the road segment, the angle between two road segments, the accuracy of GPS and the accuracy of the road network. In this paper, we use this model to improve the map-matching algorithm based on a hidden Markov model (HMM). The experimental results show that the improved matching algorithm can effectively reduce the error rate of junction matching and improve the matching performance of a navigation system."
https://openalex.org/W2942506315,"Purpose To evaluate the impact of soft contact lens eye-fit on optical power by computational modelling and to produce correction maps for reversing this impact during the design process. Methods Finite element models of spherical and toric hydrogel contact lenses at varying nominal powers of -20 D to +20 D, base curves radii (R1b) of 8.2, 8.5, 8.8 mm, and overall diameters (d3) of 14.5, 15.0, 15.5 mm were generated. Lenses were fitted to computational eye models generated with human eyes’ topography data. Combined eye-lens simulations were run under the boundary conditions of the tears’ surface tension between the contact lens and the eye in addition to the eyelid blink pressure. Lens optical zone power changes were calculated through computational light-ray tracing methods following each simulation. Results Effective power changes (EPC) were affected negatively for all toric simulated lenses with power varying from -20 D to +20 D. Spherical lenses demonstrated similar behaviour, however with some positive EPC over the power range from -20 D to -10 D for spherical power (SPH) lenses. EPC assessment was between +0.25 D and -0.5 D for most lenses, however, lenses with prescriptions from +10 D to +20 D incurred EPC outside this range. The spherical lenses showed a maximum effective power change of +1.046 ± 0.338 D (Average Eye), and a minimum of -3.278 ± 0.731 D (Steep Eye). Similarly, the toric lenses showed a maximum of +1.501 ± 0.338 D (Average Eye), and a minimum of -3.514 ± 0.731 D (Steep Eye). EPC trends, along with minimum and maximum power, generally increased negatively as nominal lens prescription increased positively. Contact lens base curve selection affected the assessed effective power change for both spherical and toric lenses. The effect from lens total diameter for spherical lenses was less substantial than that for toric lenses. Conclusions This study considered the impact of soft contact lens design parameters on effective optical power changes (EPC) after eye-fit. Spherical lenses experienced more EPC of clinical significance (>0.25 D) than toric lenses. Both types of lenses, spherical and toric (simple astigmatism), demonstrated similar trends in EPC on fitting from -20 D to +20 D, with lenses in the extremely positive and the extremely negative prescriptions demonstrating the highest EPCs. The lens base curve impacted the extent of EPC observed, with flatter base curves experiencing less power change. Diameter proved to impact toric lenses more than spherical ones, however generally the diameter has less effect on power change than base curve selection."
https://openalex.org/W2945876362,"Background The growing number of community-dwelling older adults and the increased risks of adverse health events that accompany ageing, call for health promotion interventions. Nurses often lead these interventions. The views and experiences of older adults participating in these interventions have rarely been studied. To understand the views of targeted older adults, qualitative studies are essential. The aim of this study was to investigate the views and experiences of older adults on their participation in a nurse-led intervention, taking into account their views on healthy aging. Methods In a qualitative study, nineteen Dutch older adults aged 62 to 92 years participated in semi-structured interviews. These were transcribed verbatim and coded with the Qualitative Data Analysis Miner software program. The Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven was used for data analysis. Results Based on the analysis of the interviews, the following main themes emerged from the data reflecting the experiences of the participants: 1) awareness of aging, 2) experienced interaction with the nurse, and 3) perception of the consultations as a check-up and/or personal support. Conclusions This study underscores the importance of nurse-led interventions that match older adults’ personal views concerning healthy living, and their views and experiences concerning these interventions. Older adults’ holistic views of healthy living were not always assessed and valued by the nurses. Also, our study shows a wide variety of expectations, views and experiences among the participating older adults. This implies that health professionals should adjust their working and communication methods to the older adult’s views on life."
https://openalex.org/W2900091140,"Soils in areas affected by konzo (a cassava cyanide intoxication paralytic disorder) are predominantly infertile and probably unable to supply cultivated cassava with the nutrients it needs to achieve optimal growth. Soil nutrient supply in these areas could also be influencing cyanogenic glucoside production in cassava, however there is hardly any knowledge on this. An assessment of soil nutrient levels on crop fields in konzo-affected areas was therefore carried out to determine their adequacy for optimal cassava growth. Konzo-affected Mtwara region of Tanzania, was used as a case study. Whether soil nutrient supply influences cyanogenic glucoside production in cassava cultivated in konzo-affected areas and how it could be doing this, was additionally investigated. To investigate this, correlations between total hydrogen cyanide (HCN) levels (a measure of cyanogenic glucoside content) in cassava roots and various soil nutrient levels on crops fields were carried out. This was followed by an investigation of relationships between cases of cassava cyanide intoxication and soil nutrient levels on crop fields from which the consumed toxic cassava roots had been harvested. Cases of cassava cyanide intoxication were used as a proxy for high cyanogenic glucoside levels in cassava roots. Logistic regression analysis was used in the latter investigation. Other important non-nutrient soil chemical characteristics, like pH and soil organic carbon, were also included in all analysis performed. The results revealed that most soil nutrients known to have reducing effects on cassava cyanogenic glucosides, like potassium (mean = 0.09 cmol/kg, SD = 0.05 cmol/kg), magnesium (mean = 0.26 cmol/kg, SD = 0.14 cmol/kg) and zinc (mean = 1.34 mg/kg, SD = 0.26 mg/kg) were deficient on several crop fields. The results also showed that cyanogenic glucosides in cassava roots could be increased with the increased supply of sulphur in soils in bitter cassava varieties (rs = 0.593, p = 0.032), and with the increased supply of P in soils in all cassava varieties (rs = 0.486, p = 0.026). The risk of cassava cyanide intoxication occurring (and thus high cyanogenic glucoside levels in cassava) was found to be likely increased by cultivating cassava on soils with high pH (X2 = 8.124, p = 0.004) and high iron (X2 = 5.740, p = 0.017). The study managed to establish that cassava grows under conditions of severe nutrient stress and that soil nutrient supply influences cyanogenic glucoside production in cassava cultivated in konzo-affected areas of Mtwara region. Despite the multiple soil nutrient deficiencies on crop fields, low soil fertility was however not the only probable cause of increased cyanogenic glucosides in cassava, as high soil nutrient levels were also found to be potential contributors."
https://openalex.org/W2944892365,"Introduction Despite the benefits of early antenatal care visits for early prevention, detection, and treatment of potential complications in pregnancy, a high level of provider adherence to first-visit antenatal care standards is needed. However, little information is available regarding provider adherence to antenatal care in Tanzania. This study was performed to assess provider adherence to first-visit antenatal care standards and to apply stratified analysis to identify associated factors in Tanzania. Methods Data from the 2014–2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment Survey were used in this study. Provider adherence to first-visit antenatal care standards was measured using 10 domains: client history; aspects of prior pregnancies; danger signs of the current pregnancy; physical examination; routine tests; HIV testing and counseling; maintaining a healthy pregnancy; iron/folate supplements; tetanus toxoid vaccination, and preparation for delivery. A composite score was then created in which the highest quantile (corresponding to ≥60.5%) considered to provider adhering to first-visit antenatal care standards. Initially, a series of unadjusted logistic regression analyses according to the type of facility and managing authority were performed separately at each level (i.e., facility, provider, and client). Thereafter, all variables with P < 0.2 were fitted into the respective stratified multivariable logistic regression analysis using a 5% significance level. Results A total of 1756 first-visit antenatal care consultations performed by 822 providers in 648 health facilities were analyzed. The overall median [Interquartile range, IQR] adherence to first-visit antenatal care was relatively low at 47.1% [35.7%–60.5%]. After adjusting for selected variables from each level in specific strata, at dispensary; female providers [AOR = 5.5; 95% CI, 1.8–16.4], at health centre; performance of quality assurance [AOR = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3–3.9], at hospital; availability of routine tests [AOR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3–4.8] and basic medicine [AOR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.4–5.7], at public facilities; availability of medicine [AOR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.2] and receiving refresher training [AOR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.1], and at private facility; receiving external fund from government [AOR = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1–8.4] were significantly associated with better adherence to first-visit antenatal care standards. Conclusions The study highlighted the important factors, including the provision of refresher training, regular distribution of basic medicines, and diagnostics equipment which may influence provider adherence to first-visit ANC standards."
https://openalex.org/W2946676086,"Background The barriers to uptake of guidelines underscore the importance of going beyound the mere synthesis of evidence to tailoring the synthesized evidence into local contexts and situations. This requires in-depth exploration of local factors. This project aimed to assess contextual barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a guideline developed to reduce HIV-related stigma and discrimination (SAD) in the Ethiopian healthcare setting. Methods A descriptive qualitative research study was conducted using a semi-structured interview guide informed by the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO) framework. The interview was conducted among a purposive sample of seven key informants from Jimma University and Jimma Zone HIV Prevention and Control Office. The interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed using Atlas ti version 7.5 software packages. Results Guideline attributes, provider-related factors and organizational and practice-related were identified as factors that can potentially affect the implementation of the guideline. The presence of expert patients were identified as agents for guideline implementation, whilst regular health education programs in addition to initiatives related to service quality improvement, were identified as suitable platforms to assist with the implementation of this guideline. Study participants recommended that the guideline should be disseminated through multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings, gate keepers such as opinion leaders and unit heads, one-to-five networks and mentorship programs, as well as training, workshops and posters. The current study also indicated that continuous monitoring, evaluation and mentorship are critical elements in the integration of the guideline into the system of the hospital. Conclusions This study identified that guideline implementation can make use of existing structures and pathways such as MDT meetings, service quality improvement initiatives, one-to-five networks, training and workshops. Teamwork and partnership with stakeholders should be strengthened to strengthen facilitators and tackle barriers related to the implementation of the guideline. Effective implementation of the guideline also requires establishing an implementation structure. Moreover, indicators developed to track the implementation of stigma reduction guideline should be integrated into mentorship, MDT meetings and evaluation programs of the hospital to improve performance and to assist data collection on implementation experiences."
https://openalex.org/W2946017568,"As the major somatic cell type, Sertoli cells undergo active proliferation and play essential roles to establish testis cord at fetal stage. They also function to maintain germ cell development throughout the life of testicular development. However, the significance of Sertoli cell number for testis cord development and gonocyte fate is still unclear. Nuclear protein ataxia-telangiectasia (NPAT, also known as p220), a substrate of cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2, is well known as a regulator of cell proliferation through regulating histone expression. To study the role of NPAT during Sertoli cell development, we generated a mouse strain carrying conditional floxed Npat alleles, when crossing with anti-Müllerian hormone-cre, leading to the specific deletion of Npat in Sertoli cells. Npat disruption in Sertoli cells inhibited the programmed proliferation of fetal Sertoli cells resulting in disruption of developing testis cords, and subsequent postnatal mutant testes were severely hypoplastic. Germ cells, which are presumed to be in quiescent status during perinatal stage, exited G0 phase arrest and re-enter mitotic cell cycle prematurely. Of particular note, some germ cells possessed the meiotic signal in Npat-deficient testes. Our data thus indicates that the function of Npat-dependent Sertoli cells is essential at multiple steps in testis development, and this study also identifies Sertoli cells as a major regulator of germ cell development, which are required to maintain a local growth niche to repress premature mitosis and meiosis of gonocytes.-Jiang, X., Yin, S., Fan, S., Bao, J., Jiao, Y., Ali, A., Iqbal, F., Xu, J., Zhang, Y., Shi, Q. Npat-dependent programmed Sertoli cell proliferation is indispensable for testis cord development and germ cell mitotic arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2953110917,"Traditional zoonotic disease research focuses on detection of recognized pathogens and may miss opportunities to understand broader microbial transmission dynamics between humans, animals, and the environment. We studied human-macaque microbiome overlap in Kosum Phisai District, Maha Sarakham Province, Thailand, where a growing population of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in Kosumpee Forest Park interact with humans from an adjacent village. We surveyed workers in or near the park with elevated exposure to macaques to characterize tasks resulting in exposure to macaque feces in addition to dietary and lifestyle factors that influence gut microbiome composition. Fecal samples were collected from 12 exposed workers and 6 controls without macaque exposure, as well as 8 macaques from Kosumpee Forest Park and 4 from an isolated forest patch with minimal human contact. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene from fecal sample extracted DNA was amplified and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq to characterize the microbial community. A permuted betadisper test on the weighted UniFrac distances revealed significant differences in the dispersion patterns of gut microbiota from exposed and control macaques (p = 0.03). The high variance in gut microbiota composition of macaques in contact with humans has potential implications for gut microbiome stability and susceptibility to disease, described by the Anna Karenina principle (AKP). Human samples had homogenous variance in beta diversity but different spatial medians between groups (p = 0.02), indicating a shift in microbial composition that may be explained by fundamental lifestyle differences between the groups unrelated to exposure status. SourceTracker was used to estimate the percent of gut taxa in exposed humans that was contributed by macaques. While one worker showed evidence of elevated contribution, the overall trend was not significant. Task observations among workers revealed opportunities to employ protective measures or training to reduce exposure to occupational hazards. These results suggest the potential for hygiene measures to mitigate negative aspects of contact between humans and macaques in order to optimize the health of both populations."
https://openalex.org/W2945727234,"Understanding spatial distribution, habitat use, and temporal activity patterns is important for species conservation planning. This information especially is crucial for mega herbivores like elephants as their ranging patterns encompass a myriad of habitats types. Churia habitat is geological fragile yet important for wildlife in Nepal and India. We used camera trapping and sign surveys covering 536 km2 of Churia and surrounding areas within Chitwan National Park. Across 152 trapping locations, we accumulated 2,097 trap nights in a 60-day survey during the winter season of 2010-11. We used a non-parametric kernel density function to analyze winter activity patterns of elephants detected in camera-traps. Additionally, we walked 643 km over 76 grid cells in two surveys (winter and summer) to estimate elephant distribution and intensity of habitat use using an occupancy framework. Multi-season models allowed us to make seasonal (winter versus summer) inferences regarding changes in habitat use based on covariates influencing use and detection. We photographed 25 mammalian species including elephants with calves with a trapping rate of 2.72 elephant photos events per 100 trap nights. Elephant winter activity pattern was found to be mainly nocturnal, with crepuscular peaks. Covariates such as normalized differential vegetation index and terrain ruggedness positively influenced elephant spatial distribution and habitat use patterns within the Churia habitat. We also found lower elephant habitat use ([Formula: see text]) of Churia in winter 0.51 (0.02) than in summer 0.57 (0.02). Elephants heavily used the eastern portion of Churia in both seasons (67-69%). Overall, Churia habitat, which is often ignored, clearly is used by elephants, with increases in summer use in the west and high use year-round in the east, and thus should no longer be neglected or forgotten in species conservation planning."

Placental P-glycoprotein (P-gp) plays a vital role in fetal toxicants exposure and subsequently affects the risk of toxicants-induced birth defects. However, data on the role of placental P-gp in decreasing toxicants-induced cardiac anomalies is extremely limited. This study aimed to explore the protective role of placental P-gp in reducing the risk of Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) induced cardiac anomalies in mice.The C57BL mice were randomly divided into four groups: the vehicle group (corn oil, n = 10), 500mg/Kg DEHP group (n = 15), 3mg/Kg verapamil group (n = 10) and 500mg/Kg DEHP & 3mg/Kg verapamil group (n = 20). Pregnant dams in different group received respective intervention by gavage once daily from E6.5-14.5. Maternal weights were monitored every day and samples were collected at E15.5. HE staining was used to examine fetal cardiac malformations. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western-Blot were applied to detect Nkx2.5/Gata4/Tbx5/Mef2c/Chf1 mRNA and protein expression, respectively. The mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) was also determined using RT-qPCR.Co-administration of verapamil and DEHP significantly elevated fetal cardiac malformation rates, in comparison with the DEHP group, the verapamil group and the vehicle group. Different phenotypes of cardiac anomalies, including septal defects and ventricular myocardium noncompaction, were noted both in the DEHP group and the DEHP & verapamil group. The ventricular myocardium noncompaction appeared to be more severe in the DEHP & verapamil group. Fetal cardiac PPARγ mRNA expression was notably increased and Gata4/Mef2c/Chf1 expression was markedly decreased in the DEHP & verapamil group.Placental P-gp inhibition enhances susceptibility to DEHP induced cardiac malformations in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2946223216,"Background Musculoskeletal symptoms in people living with HIV (PLWH) such as pain, joint stiffness, and fatigue are commonly reported. Prevalence rates of up to 45%, 79% and 88% respectively have been reported. However, very little is known about differences in prevalence and impact of musculoskeletal symptoms on physical functioning and quality of life of PLWH on effective combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) in high and low-resource settings. Methods A cross-sectional study of PLWH on effective cART enrolled from two large urban clinics in the UK and Zambia was conducted in 2016. Eligible participants had no history of trauma to the joints within 4 weeks of recruitment, or documented evidence of previous rheumatic disease. Current musculoskeletal symptoms, functional ability, and health-related quality of life were evaluated using the health assessment (HAQ) and quality-of-life short form (SF-36) self-reported questionnaires. Results 214 patients were enrolled (108:UK and 106:Zambia). Participants from Zambia were younger (47 vs 44 years) and had significantly lower CD4 counts (640 vs 439 cells/mL p = 0.018) compared to those from the UK, while the UK group had lived with HIV longer (11 vs 6 years; p<0.001) and reported more comorbidities than the Zambian group (66% vs 26%; p<0.001). Musculoskeletal pain was common in both groups (UK:69% vs Zambia:61% p = 0.263) but no significant differences in physical functional capacity between the groups were observed. However, the UK group had significantly worse quality of life measurements (general health, vitality, mental health, emotional, and social functioning) associated with musculoskeletal symptoms compared to the Zambian group (p<0.001). Conclusions Musculoskeletal symptoms in PLWH from both the UK and Zambia were common. PLWH in the UK reported worse quality of life measures associated with musculoskeletal symptoms compared to those in Zambia, suggesting that factors such as mental health, patient expectations and multimorbidity might play a role in determining well-being and quality of life of PLWH with musculoskeletal symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2945601369,"Phlebotomines have been recorded from a wide variety of habitats, and some of these vector species have shown preference for human environments, with high levels of adaptation. This study evaluated the degree of preference of these vectors for urban, rural, and forested environments (synanthropic behavior), as well as the diversity of these species, in three areas (forested, rural, and urban, exhibiting different degrees of anthropogenic changes) in a region of intense transmission of visceral leishmaniasis in Corumbá county, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Using light traps, sand fly specimens were collected from the three environments simultaneously, from May 2015 to April 2017, totaling 7 213 sand flies of 14 species in eight genera. Nuorteva's synanthropy index was determined for the species Lutzomyia cruzi, Brumptomyia brumpti, Micropygomyia peresi, Lu. forattinii, Martinsmyia oliveirai and Evandromyia corumbaensis. Lutzomyia cruzi, the vector of Leishmania infantum in Corumbá, was the most abundant vector species, recorded from all three areas and sampling plots, on all 24 months investigated. This species exhibited the highest synanthropic index (+75.09), indicating a strong preference for urban environments. Brumptomyia brumpti, Micropygomyia peresi, Lu. forattinii, and Martinsmyia oliveirai showed preference, albeit not strong, for urban environments. Overall, males were more abundant than females (W = 490; p < 0.0001). High density, high synanthropic index, and sustained indoor presence were found for Mi. peresi in the rural area. Monitoring changes in the ecological behavior of sand flies is of vital importance, as these changes may indicate an increased likelihood of leishmaniasis emergence or reemergence."
https://openalex.org/W2946201997,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important components of the host innate defense mechanism against invading microorganisms. Although AMPs are known to act on bacterial membranes and increase membrane permeability, the action mechanism of most AMPs still remains unclear. In this report, we found that the TP4 peptides from Nile tilapia anchored on E. coli cells and enabled them permeable to SYTOX Green in few minutes after TP4 addition. TP4 peptides existed in small dots either on live or glutaraldehyde-fixed cells. TP4 peptides were driven into oligomers either in soluble or insoluble form by a membrane-mimicking anionic surfactant, sarkosyl, depending on the concentrations employed. The binding forces among TP4 components were mediated through hydrophobic interaction. The soluble oligomers were negatively charged on surface, while the insoluble oligomers could be fused with each other or piled on existing particles to form larger particles with diameters 0.1 to 20 μm by hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly, the morphology and solubility of TP4 particles changed with the concentration of exogenous sarkosyl or trifluoroethanol. The TP4 peptides were assembled into oligomers on or in bacterial membrane. This study provides direct evidence and a model for the oligomerization and insertion of AMPs into bacterial membrane before entering into cytosol."

This modality finds widespread usage in ophthalmology for the diagnosis and management of various ocular conditions. The volumes generated can contain 200 or more B-scans. Manual inspection of such large quantity of scans is time consuming and error prone in most clinical settings. Here, we present a method for the generation of visual summaries of SDOCT volumes, wherein a small set of B-scans that highlight the most clinically relevant features in a volume are extracted. The method was trained and evaluated on data acquired from age-related macular degeneration patients, and “relevance” was defined as the presence of visibly discernible structural abnormalities. The summarisation system consists of a detection module, where relevant B-scans are extracted from the volume, and a set of rules that determines which B-scans are included in the visual summary. Two deep learning approaches are presented and compared for the classification of B-scans—transfer learning and de novo learning. Both approaches performed comparably with AUCs of 0.97 and 0.96, respectively, obtained on an independent test set. The de novo network, however, was 98% smaller than the transfer learning approach, and had a run-time that was also significantly shorter."
https://openalex.org/W2944574036,"Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter with actions across phylogeny that modulate core behaviors such as motor activity, reward, attention, and cognition. Perturbed DA signaling in humans is associated with multiple disorders, including addiction, ADHD, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease. The presynaptic DA transporter exerts powerful control on DA signaling by efficient clearance of the neurotransmitter following release. As in vertebrates, Caenorhabditis elegans DAT (DAT-1) constrains DA signaling and loss of function mutations in the dat-1 gene result in slowed crawling on solid media and swimming-induced paralysis (Swip) in water. Previously, we identified a mutant line, vt34, that exhibits robust DA-dependent Swip. vt34 exhibits biochemical and behavioral phenotypes consistent with reduced DAT-1 function though vt34; dat-1 double mutants exhibit an enhanced Swip phenotype, suggesting contributions of the vt34-associated mutation to additional mechanisms that lead to excess DA signaling. SNP mapping and whole genome sequencing of vt34 identified the site of the molecular lesion in the gene B0412.2 that encodes the Runx transcription factor ortholog RNT-1. Unlike dat-1 animals, but similar to other loss of function rnt-1 mutants, vt34 exhibits altered male tail morphology and reduced body size. Deletion mutations in both rnt-1 and the bro-1 gene, which encodes a RNT-1 binding partner also exhibit Swip. Both vt34 and rnt-1 mutations exhibit reduced levels of dat-1 mRNA as well as the tyrosine hydroxylase ortholog cat-2. Although reporter studies indicate that rnt-1 is expressed in DA neurons, its re-expression in DA neurons of vt34 animals fails to fully rescue Swip. Moreover, as shown for vt34, rnt-1 mutation exhibits additivity with dat-1 in generating Swip, as do rnt-1 and bro-1 mutations, and vt34 exhibits altered capacity for acetylcholine signaling at the neuromuscular junction. Together, these findings identify a novel role for rnt-1 in limiting DA neurotransmission and suggest that loss of RNT-1 may disrupt function of both DA neurons and body wall muscle to drive Swip."
https://openalex.org/W2945994638,"The genetic programs responsible for pulmonary lymphatic maturation prior to birth are not known. To address this gap in knowledge, we developed a novel cell sorting strategy to collect fetal pulmonary lymphatic endothelial cells (PLECs) for global transcriptional profiling. We identified PLECs based on their unique cell surface immunophenotype (CD31+/Vegfr3+/Lyve1+/Pdpn+) and isolated them from murine lungs during late gestation (E16.5, E17.5, E18.5). Gene expression profiling was performed using whole-genome microarrays, and 1,281 genes were significantly differentially expressed with respect to time (FDR q < 0.05) and grouped into six clusters. Two clusters containing a total of 493 genes strongly upregulated at E18.5 were significantly enriched in genes with functional annotations corresponding to innate immune response, positive regulation of angiogenesis, complement & coagulation cascade, ECM/cell-adhesion, and lipid metabolism. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified several pathways coordinately upregulated during late gestation, the strongest of which was the type-I IFN-α/β signaling pathway. Upregulation of canonical interferon target genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization in E18.5 PLECs. We also identified transcriptional events consistent with a prenatal PLEC maturation program. This PLEC-specific program included individual genes (Ch25h, Itpkc, Pcdhac2 and S1pr3) as well as a set of chemokines and genes containing an NF-κB binding site in their promoter. Overall, this work reveals transcriptional insights into the genes, signaling pathways and biological processes associated with pulmonary lymphatic maturation in the fetal lung."

We proposed a comparative design of a quasi-experimental type, considering as the treatment group the respondents who said that they had used homeopathic products in the past two weeks; and another group, for control, comprising respondents who said that they had not used this type of products, but only conventional medicines, with observable characteristics similar to those of the treatment group. We used a model for rare events logistics regression (relogit) to estimate the probability of using homeopathy. From the propensity score and a vector of control variables, we used techniques of genetic matching to match individuals from the treatment group with similar individuals belonging to the control group.There are no statistically significant differences between users and non-users of homeopathy in visits to the general practitioner (P>|z| 0.387), to the specialist (P>|z| 0.52), in hospitalisations (P>|z| 0.592) or in the use of emergency services (P>|z| 0.109). Nor were there any statistically significant differences in the performance of routine tests, except for the faecal occult blood test, which is more prevalent in users of homeopathic products. 20.9% of users of homeopathy had done this test compared with 15.3% of non-users (P>|z| 0.022). There are also significant differences in vaccination against influenza with 12.6% of homeopathy users stating that they had been vaccinated in the last influenza campaign, against 21.0% of non-users (P>|z| <0.001). The health conditions which homeopathy users reported were constipation (OR: 1.65 CI: 1.16-2.36), malignant tumour (OR: 1.60 CI: 1.09-2.36) osteoporosis (OR: 1.49 CI: 1.05-2.10), varicose veins (OR: 1.35 CI: 1.05-1.74) and allergy (OR: 1.35 CI: 1.06-1.72).Differences in the use of healthcare resources between users and non-users of homeopathic products have not been found to be statistically significant in Spain. It has been shown that most homeopathic products are used as a complement to treatment with conventional medicine. Nevertheless, our results highlight some warning signs which should raise the attention of healthcare authorities. The use of these therapies in patients with malignant tumours and the rejection of vaccines are warning signs of a possible health hazard in the long term."
https://openalex.org/W2950519958,"Vaginal lubricants are commonly used by couples trying-to-conceive. However, most vaginal lubricants are sperm toxic and therefore should not be used by couples trying-to-conceive. Despite this, lubricant sperm toxicity is insufficiently reported and guidance for healthcare professionals (HCPs) is absent. In this study, lubricant-related practices of fertility-based HCPs in Scotland were sampled via an online survey. Lubricants identified as being utilised in the fertility setting were subsequently incubated with prepared sperm samples to establish effects on sperm motility. HCP recommendations (n = 32) on lubricant use were varied although knowledge related to sperm toxicity was generally poor. HCPs infrequently asked about lubricant use and were unaware of guidance in this area. Aquagel, the only prescribed lubricant identified in this study, reduced sperm progressive motility to 49% of control after 10 minutes, even at concentrations as low as 5%. Vitality testing suggested the deterioration in progressive motility with Aquagel was not as a result of cell death. Conversely, Pré Vaginal Lubricant, a ‘sperm-safe’ lubricant, did not significantly affect any markers of sperm function assessed. Development of clinical guidance in this area is recommended to ensure HCPs deliver informed advice as lubricant use in couples trying-to-conceive may inadvertently contribute to delay in conception."
https://openalex.org/W2944865027,"Background We investigated the effects of preoperative oral carbohydrate loading on intraoperative catabolism, nutritional parameters, and adipocytokine levels during anesthesia. Methods Study participants were randomized to two groups who were allowed to consume either no more than 250 mL of 18% oral carbohydrate solution (Arginaid Water: AW group) or no more than 500 mL of plain water (PW group) within the 2 hours before surgery, with no intraoperative glucose administration. Percentage changes from preoperative values of resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total body water (TBW), determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), were compared. Blood levels of serum ketone bodies, free fatty acids (FFAs), insulin, 3-methyl histidine, blood glucose, retinol binding protein, adiponectin, and leptin were measured. BIA measurement and blood sampling were performed on entry to the operating room (M1) and 2 hours after the induction of anesthesia (M2). Chi squared test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon’s test were used for comparisons of parameters. P values less than 0.05 constituted a significant difference. Results Seventeen patients per group (34 patients total) were enrolled. RMR and TBW values did not differ between M1 and M2 measurements. Participants in the AW group had lower blood ketone body and FFA levels and higher insulin levels at M1. However, their ketone body and FFA levels rose and insulin levels fell after 2 hours, although ketone body and FFA levels in the AW group were still lower than those in the PW group. Although retinol binding protein, adiponectin, and leptin levels were not different in terms of preoperative oral carbohydrate loading, the levels of these substances in both groups were lower after 2 hours compared with levels on operating room entry. Conclusions Preoperative oral carbohydrate loading without intraoperative glucose administration appears to suppress catabolism for 2 hours after the start of surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2944951492,"To assess the influence of bariatric surgery on transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) expression and its association with body mass index (BMI) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Prospective study performed between 2016 and 2018, where 26 obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery were divided into two subgroups: diabetics and non-diabetics. The RNAs were extracted from peripheral blood samples that were obtained from each patient in two different moments: before surgery and after 12 months of follow-up. The relative expression of TCF7L2 was determined according to the delta-Ct method.The linear regression model of BMI x delta-Ct showed a positive correlation (p = 0.037). In the subgroups, an inversely proportional relationship was found between delta-Ct and BMI in the diabetic group and a directly proportional relationship in the non-diabetic group (p>0.05 in both). In the postoperative period, the regression model was similar to the preoperative, except when analyzing the subgroups, where diabetic patients showed a directly proportional relationship (p>0.05). The relative expression of TCF7L2 showed an average of 1.16 ± 0.91, CI-95% 0.79-1.53. There was an increase in relative expression of 48% in the non-diabetic group (p = 0.021), and a decrease of 27% in the T2DM group (p>0.05) in the postoperative. There was a positive correlation between a greater decrease in BMI and increased relative expression (p = 0.027).Our results showed that generally, the TCF7L2 expression increase with a decrease in BMI, however, for patients with T2DM, it exhibits an inverse pattern, which is normalized one year after bariatric surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2945396192,"Abnormal red blood cell (RBC) adhesion to endothelial αvβ3 plays a crucial role in triggering vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle cell disease (SCD). It is known that epinephrine, a β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulator, increases the RBC surface density of active intercellular adhesion molecule-4 (ICAM-4) which binds to the endothelial αvβ3. It has also been demonstrated that in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, mouse cardiomyocytes, and COS-7 cell lines, the β-adrenergic and renin-angiotensin systems are interrelated and that there is a direct interaction and cross-regulation between β-AR and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). Selective blockade of AT1R reciprocally inhibits the downstream signaling of β-ARs, similar to the inhibition observed in the presence of a β-AR-blocker. However, it is not known if this mechanism is active in human RBCs. Here, we studied the effect of valsartan, an AT1R blocker, on the surface density of active ICAM-4 receptors in normal, sickle cell trait, and homozygous sickle RBCs. We applied single molecule force spectroscopy to detect active ICAM-4 receptors on the RBC plasma membrane with and without the presence of valsartan and epinephrine. We found that epinephrine significantly increased whereas valsartan decreased their surface density. Importantly, we found that pretreatment of RBCs with valsartan significantly impeded the activation of ICAM-4 receptors induced by epinephrine. The observed reduced expression of active ICAM-4 receptors on the RBC plasma membrane leads us to conjecture that valsartan may be used as a supporting remedy for the prevention and treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in SCD."
https://openalex.org/W2945779910,"Background 
Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of mortality and is associated with cardiac remodeling. Vulnerability to atrial fibrillation (AF) has been shown to be greater in the early stages of HF, whereas ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation develop during late stages. Here, we explore changes in gene expression that underlie the differential development of fibrosis and structural alterations that predispose to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.


Objective 
To study transcriptomic changes associated with the development of cardiac arrhythmias in early and late stages of heart failure.


Methods 
Dogs were tachy-paced from right ventricle (RV) for 2–3 or 5–6 weeks (early and late HF). We performed transcriptomic analysis of right atria (RA) and RV isolated from control dogs and those in early and late HF. Transcripts with mean relative log2-fold change ≥2 were included in the differential analysis with significance threshold adjusted to p<0.05.


Results 
Early HF remodeling was more prominent in RA with enrichment of extracellular matrix, circulatory system, wound healing and immune response pathways; many of these processes were not present in RA in late HF. RV showed no signs of remodeling in early HF but enrichment of extracellular matrix and wound healing in late HF.


Conclusion 
Our transcriptomic data indicate significant fibrosis-associated transcriptional changes in RA in early HF and in RV in late HF, with strong atrial predominance. These alterations in gene expression are consistent with the development of arrhythmogenesis in atria in early but not late HF and in the ventricle in late but not early HF."
https://openalex.org/W2946228348,"The rapid development and diffusion of new technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence makes life more convenient. At the same time, people may develop overdependence on technology to simplify everyday tasks or to reduce the level of effort required to accomplish them. We conduct a two-phase real-effort laboratory experiment to assess how external assistance affects subsequent revealed preferences for the convenience of a lower level of effort versus monetary rewards requiring greater effort. The results suggest that men treated with external help in the first phase tend to choose more difficult options with potentially higher monetary rewards. In contrast, after being treated with external help, women exhibit a stronger propensity to utilize the convenience of an easier task and are less likely to choose a more difficult option that carries higher potential earnings."
