https://openalex.org/W2016620180,"A series of seven monoclonal antibodies was produced against the T-lineage-specific 50 kd T11 sheep erythrocyte rosette (SRBC) receptor protein in order to define the function of the molecule. Three distinct epitopes were detected: T11(1), the SRBC binding site expressed on all T lymphocytes and thymocytes; T11(2), an epitope unrelated to the SRBC binding site but with a similar distribution; and T11(3), a neo-epitope expressed only upon T-cell activation. Simultaneous triggering of T11(2) and T11(3) epitopes by monoclonal antibodies induces T lymphocytes to proliferate and mediate their functional programs in the absence of antigen and/or antigen-presenting cells. This antigen-independent mode of triggering is distinct from that involving the T3-Ti antigen receptor complex and represents an alternate pathway of T-cell activation. Given that T11 is the earliest T-lineage surface glycoprotein to appear in thymic ontogeny and is thus expressed before T3-Ti, the former may be involved in clonal expansion and/or differentiation during early development."
https://openalex.org/W2083611460,"Arachidonate and other unsaturated long-chain fatty acids were found to activate protein kinase C from human neutrophils. Kinase activation by arachidonate required calcium and was enhanced by diolein but did not require exogenous phosphatidylserine. Submaximal levels of arachidonate also enhanced the affinity of the kinase for calcium during activation by phosphatidylserine. Thus the release of arachidonate, which is triggered in many cell types by ligand-receptor interactions, could play a second messenger role in the regulation of cellular function by activation of protein kinase C."

https://openalex.org/W1494605757,"The Sm small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) from mammalian cells have been characterized as containing U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 RNA associated with some subset of at least 10 distinct polypeptides (called 68K, A, A', B, B', C, D, E, F, and G) that range in molecular weight from 68,000 to 11,000. Whereas this entire collection of snRNP particles is precipitated by patient anti-Sm autoantibodies, anti-(U1)RNP autoantibodies specifically recognize U1 snRNPs. Here, we have performed immunoblots using the sera from 29 patients and a mouse anti-Sm monoclonal antibody to identify which HeLa cell snRNP proteins carry anti-Sm or anti-(U1)RNP antigenic determinants. Strikingly, every serum surveyed, as well as the monoclonal antibody, recognizes determinants on two or more snRNP protein components. The three proteins, 68K, A, and C, that uniquely fractionate with U1 snRNPs are specifically reactive with anti-(U1)RNP sera in blots. Anti-Sm patient sera and the mouse monoclonal antibody react with proteins B, B', D, and sometimes E, one or more of which must be present on all Sm snRNPs. The blot results combined with data obtained from a refined 32P-labeled RNA immunoprecipitation assay reveal that, in our collection of the sera from 29 patients, anti-Sm rarely exists in the absence of equal or higher titers of anti-(U1)RNP; moreover, (U1)RNP sera often contain detectable levels of anti-Sm. Our findings further define the protein composition of the Sm snRNPs and raise intriguing questions concerning the relatedness of snRNP polypeptides and the mechanism of autoantibody induction."

https://openalex.org/W2018702592,"The two distal transcription signals of the herpesvirus tk gene share a common hexanucleotide sequence and function in a mutually dependent manner. We examined their roles by introducing corresponding base mutations into each hexanucleotide. The effects of mutations in the hexanucleotide of the first distal signal match the pattern of effects of the corresponding mutations in the second distal signal. These concordant patterns suggest that the hexanucleotide repeats are functionally analogous. There is one difference between the two distal signals. Disruption of the second distal signal concomitantly inactivates the first distal signal; disruption of the first distal signal leads to only partial inactivation of the second distal signal. When the positions of the two distal signals are switched, the partial dependence of the second distal signal is alleviated. We suggest a model for positive transcriptional control analogous to activation of the cl maintenance promoter of bacteriophage lambda by repressor."
https://openalex.org/W1484364314,"In leaves and intact chloroplasts, oxidation and reduction have been shown previously to regulate the ATPase activity of thylakoids. Illumination of spinach chloroplast thylakoids in the presence of dithiothreitol, which activates the ability of thylakoids to catalyze sustained ATP hydrolysis in the dark, causes increased incorporation of N-ethylmaleimide into the gamma subunit of coupling factor 1 (CF1). A disulfide bond in the gamma subunit is reduced during activation. The residues involved in this disulfide bond are the same as those in the disulfide linkage reduced during dithiothreitol activation of soluble CF1. The disulfide and dithiol forms of the gamma subunit may be separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. N-Ethylmaleimide is preferentially incorporated in the dark into the reduced form of the gamma subunit of CF1 in thylakoids previously exposed to dithiothreitol. Only a subpopulation of the CF1 in thylakoids is susceptible to dithiothreitol reduction and subsequent reaction with N-ethylmaleimide in the dark. Alkylation of the thiol groups exposed by reduction of the disulfide bond protects ATPase activity from inhibition by oxidants. At a given value of the transmembrane pH differential, photophosphorylation rates in dithiothreitol-activated thylakoids can be as much as seven to eight times those of nonactivated controls. N-Ethylmaleimide treatment of activated thylakoids in the dark prevents the loss of the stimulation of ATP synthesis on storage of the thylakoids. Photophosphorylation by intact chloroplasts lysed in assay mixtures is also activated in comparison to that by washed thylakoids. At a low ADP concentration, the rate of photophosphorylation approaches saturation as delta pH increases. These results suggest that the gamma subunit of CF1 plays an important role in regulation of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1519935522,"Autoantibodies directed against the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) have been found in the serum of a patient with scleroderma-polymyositis overlap syndrome. This specificity, called anti-(U2)-RNP, is distinct from all previously described autoantibodies, including those that precipitate related snRNPs: anti-Sm antibodies, which react with the entire set of U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs, and anti-(U1)RNP antibodies, which recognize only U1 snRNPs. From HeLa cell extracts, anti-(U2)RNP immunoprecipitates predominantly one 32P-labeled RNA species, identified as U2 small nuclear RNA, and six [35S]methionine-labeled protein bands, A' (Mr = 32,000), B (Mr = 28,000), D (Mr = 16,000), E (Mr = 13,000), F (Mr = 12,000), and G (Mr = 11,000). Protein blot analysis reveals that the A' protein carries (U2)RNP antigenic determinant(s) and therefore represents a polypeptide unique to the U2 snRNP; the B protein associated with U2 snRNPs may also be unique. Like U1 and the other Sm snRNPs, U2 snRNPs occupy a nuclear, non-nucleolar location and are antigenically conserved from insects to man. An antibody specific for the U2 snRNP will be useful in deciphering the function of this particle."
https://openalex.org/W1511506036,"Subunit association of beta-hexosaminidase was studied in intact fibroblasts using antisera that discriminate between free and associated alpha-chains. These were anti-beta-hexosaminidase A (anti-alpha beta), which precipitated all alpha-chains, free or associated; anti-beta-hexosaminidase B (anti-beta beta), which precipitated those alpha-chains that were associated with beta; and anti-alpha-chains, which recognized only monomeric alpha-chains. After biosynthetic labeling, beta-hexosaminidase or its free alpha-subunit were immuno-precipitated from extracts of cells and medium with the aid of protein A-bearing Staphylococcus aureus, subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by fluorography. Pulse-chase labeling showed that the alpha-chains existed predominantly in the monomeric precursor form during the first 5 h, and then began to accumulate in the mature (lysosomal) associated alpha beta form. Precursor alpha beta complexes were secreted, along with some precursor alpha monomers; the latter were catalytically inert. Both alpha- and beta-chains were phosphorylated (a Golgi modification) prior to association. Thus alpha-beta association probably occurred in the Golgi area before transfer to lysosomes and before secretion. Cycloheximide inhibited the association and subsequent maturation of preformed alpha-chains, perhaps by causing a depletion of a pool of beta-chain precursor upstream from the site of subunit association. In fibroblasts from a patient with Sandhoff disease, that produced no beta-chains, the alpha-chains self-associated but their maturation was markedly decreased. We suggest that association with beta-chains is necessary not only for acquisition of catalytic activity but also for transport of alpha-chains to lysosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1513148305,"The purified Ca2+-pumping ATPase of the erythrocyte plasma membrane has been subjected to a controlled proteolytic treatment with trypsin. The treatment has been previously shown to shift the enzyme from low to high Ca2+ affinity in the absence of calmodulin. The treatment leads to the fragmentation of the ATPase molecule into a number of products and to the accumulation of major limit polypeptides having Mr of 14,000, 28,000, 33,500, 48,000, and 76,000. The 33,500 Mr fragment reacts with 3(trifluoromethyl)-3 (m-[125I]iodophenyl)-diazirine, suggesting that it contains intramembrane regions of the enzyme. A number of minor fragmentation products were also formed, among them a polypeptide of Mr = 90,000 which is rapidly degraded further and a limit polypeptide of Mr about 25,000. [125I]Iodoazidocalmodulin cross-linked only to the original ATPase and to the fragments with Mr = 90,000 and Mr about 25,000. The Mr = 90,000 fragment can be isolated on calmodulin-Sepharose and on phenothiazine affinity columns. It retains the functional properties of the intact pump; it has a calmodulin-responsive ATPase activity and it actively accumulates Ca2+ upon incorporation into liposomes. Further proteolysis of the Mr = 90,000 fragment produces a fragment of Mr = 81,000-76,000 which forms an acylphosphate intermediate, which does not bind to calmodulin-Sepharose, and which seems to be responsible for the calmodulin-insensitive activity which appears as it is produced. A model is presented which postulates a major and a minor degradation pattern and rationalizes the pattern of proteolysis and of the [125I]iodoazidocalmodulin binding observed."
https://openalex.org/W1544586363,"The cysteinyl peptides of the gamma subunit of chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1) have been analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Analysis of the reduced enzyme alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine showed that the gamma subunit contains four cysteinyl residues. Two of these residues are involved in a disulfide linkage in CF1 either in solution or bound to washed thylakoid membranes. Two free sulfhydryls, one that is readily attacked by alkylating reagents and another that is less reactive, were also detected. Each of these four cysteinyl residues is present in a separate tryptic peptide derived from the gamma subunit. These results show that 4-vinylpyridine is an excellent reagent for the analysis of cysteinyl-containing peptides and support our analyses of the roles of cysteinyl residues in the gamma subunit in ATP synthesis and hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1500482096,"Cardiac sarcolemma proteins were phosphorylated by exogenous Ca2+-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C). The phosphorylation reactions were absolutely dependent on the simultaneous presence of Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidic acid were ineffective in supporting protein kinase C-catalyzed membrane phosphorylation. The reactions were not stimulated by diolein. In contrast, diolein inhibited phosphatidylserine-stimulated phosphorylation at all calcium concentrations tested. The major substrates for protein kinase C in cardiac membranes were peptides of 88,000, 51,000, 42,000 daltons, and the peptide known as phospholamban (Mr = 27,000 or 11,000 depending on sample preparation). Phosphorylation of phospholamban by protein kinase C was additive with that catalyzed by membrane-bound or exogenous cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and with Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. The results suggest that protein kinase C might have a role in the regulation of cardiac membrane phosphorylation by beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1512105707,"The oxygen exchange parameters for the hydrolysis of ATP by the F1-ATPase have been determined over a 140,000-fold range of ATP concentrations and a 5,000-fold range of reaction velocity. The average number of water oxygens incorporated into each Pi product ranges from a limit of about 1.02 at saturating ATP concentrations to a limit of about 3.97 at very low ATP concentrations. The latter value represents 400 reversals of hydrolysis of bound ATP prior to Pi dissociation. In accord with the binding change mechanism, this means that ATP binding at one catalytic site increases the off constant of Pi and ADP from another catalytic site by at least 20,000-fold, equivalent to the use of 6 kcal mol-1 of ATP binding energy to promote product release. The estimated rate of reversal of hydrolysis of F1-ATPase-bound ATP to bound ADP + Pi varies only about 5-fold with ATP concentration. The rate is similar that observed previously for reversal of bound ATP hydrolysis or synthesis with the membrane-bound enzyme and is greater than the rate of net ATP formation during oxidative phosphorylation. This adds to evidence that energy input or membrane components are not required for bound ATP synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1538690067,"[1-14C]Docosahexaenoic acid (n-3) was incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 min in the presence of rat liver microsomes and 1 mM NADPH. The products were isolated using organic solvent extractions, reverse phase, and normal phase high performance liquid chromatography. Isolates were identified using ultraviolet spectroscopy, capillary gas-liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The major metabolites were: 19,20-, 16,17-, 13,14-, 10,11-, and 7,8-dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acids, 22-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid, and 21-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid. The minor metabolites were 17-hydroxy-4,7,10,13,15,19-, 16-hydroxy-4,7,10,17,19-, 14-hydroxy-4,7,10,12,-16,19-, 13-hydroxy-4,7,10,14,16,19-, 11-hydroxy-4,7,9,13,16,19-, 10-hydroxy-4,7, 11,13,16,19-, 8-hydroxy-4,6,10,13,16,19-, and 7-hydroxy-4,8,10,13,16,19 -docosahexaenoic acids. These metabolites of docosahexaenoic acid resulted from four distinct classes of oxidation, omega-hydroxylations, (omega-1)-hydroxylations, epoxidations, and lipoxygenase-like hydroxylations. The similarity of these product profiles to those reported for comparable microsomal incubations with other essential fatty acids suggest that microsome cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases were involved."
https://openalex.org/W1609924567,"The oligomeric size of calcium pump protein (CPP) in fast skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane was determined using target theory analysis of radiation inactivation data. There was a parallel decrease of Ca2+-ATPase and calcium pumping activities with increasing radiation dose. The loss of staining intensity of the CPP band, observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, also correlated directly with the loss of activity. The target size molecular weight of the CPP in the normal sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane ranged between 210,000 and 250,000, which is consistent with a dimeric structure. Essentially the same size is obtained for the non-phosphorylated CPP or for the phosphoenzyme form generated from either ATP (E1 state) or inorganic phosphate (E2 state). Hence, the oligomeric state of the pump does not appear to change during the catalytic cycle. Similar results were obtained with reconstituted sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane vesicles with different lipid to protein ratios. We conclude that the CPP is a dimer in both native and reconstituted sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. The target size of the calcium-binding protein (calsequestrin) was found to be 50,000 daltons, approximating a monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1550569215,"A factor ( TFIIIA ) specifically required for transcription of the 5 S RNA gene has been physically and enzymatically characterized in its native state. TFIIIA is a monomer of 38,600 Da with a Stokes radius of 34 A and a sedimentation coefficient of 2.8 S. A calculated frictional ratio of 1.53 indicates that it is highly asymmetric, and suggests the possibility that as little as 1 molecule bound/5 S RNA gene is sufficient to account for the previously documented interaction with the promoter region of the gene. In addition, TFIIIA does not contain any detectable ATPase or protein kinase activity, and its ability to be used in transcription is inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. Incubation of a 5 S gene-containing plasmid with a molar excess of TFIIIA results in the formation of a complex which can be separated from unbound TFIIIA by gel exclusion chromatography. The isolated complex displays a TFIIIA :5 S gene stoichiometry of 1:1, is fully functional when complemented with other transcription components, and is directly dependent upon the presence of a 5 S gene for its formation. Further analyses of requirements for complex formation indicate that the presence of 5 S RNA in the prechromatographic incubation is required to eliminate nonspecific interactions of TFIIIA while at the same time allowing retention of its gene-specific interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1575962485,"The vacuoles of Neurospora crassa, grown in minimal medium, contain a 1:1 ratio of basic amino acids and phosphate, the latter in the form of long-chain, inorganic polyphosphate-P. Vacuoles isolated from cells depleted of polyphosphate retain basic amino acids despite the absence of over 90% of their polyphosphate. Thus, vacuolar retention of basic amino acids is not dependent upon binding to or charge neutralization by polyphosphate. Polyphosphate was found to be the only macromolecular polyanion in vacuoles of normal or phosphate-depleted cells. Gel filtration experiments revealed that about half the polyphosphate of normal vacuoles is bound strongly by vacuolar spermidine, Mg2+, and Ca2+. The polyphosphate thus occupied was not available for basic amino acid binding. We have identified about 90% of the cations of isolated vacuoles; in addition to spermidine, Mg2+, and Ca2+, the cation pool consists mainly of arginine, ornithine, histidine, lysine, and Na+, with a small amount of K+. Isolated vacuoles appear to be almost wholly impermeable to all these ions, and in vivo, vacuoles appear to be highly selective in ion uptake by an active process. The interaction of basic amino acid with the available polyphosphate was found to reduce the chemical activity of the former. In keeping with this effect, cells with abnormally high basic amino acid-polyphosphate ratios displayed greatly swollen vacuoles, indicating considerable osmotic activity of the basic amino acids and their counterions under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1491875765,"Abstract The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of thrombospondin and of a 30,000-Da heparin-binding peptide derived from thrombospondin by treatment with plasmin are identical. The heparin-binding peptide is homogeneous in size but slightly heterogeneous in charge with the predominant isoelectric points being 6.1 and 5.7. Electron microscopy of tungsten replicas of thrombospondin reveals a tripartite structure resembling a bola which is about 60 nm across when fully extended. Each part of the molecule terminates in a globular node or head which disappears upon limited plasmin digestion, suggesting that the heparin-binding peptide is located in the head region. In addition to the heparin-binding peptide, a 20,000-Da peptide also apparently associated with the head region is liberated during proteolysis. The electron micrographs indicate that the legs of the bola-like structure must be folded into an extended, flexible, tertiary structure. These legs, each of about 65,000 Da, appear to be attached near the ends opposite the heads, probably by disulfide bonds. Each leg possesses a tab or protein (approximately 20,000 Da) which juts out from this attachment point."
https://openalex.org/W1523690426,"Two specific calmodulin antagonists, compound 48/80 and calmidazolium , at concentrations of 10-20 micrograms/ml and 10-20 microM, respectively, inhibited Ca2+ uptake in skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles without affecting Ca2+-ATPase activity. The drugs also inhibited the calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of 85,000-, 60,000-, and 20,000-dalton proteins, but not the calmodulin-independent phosphorylation of other sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins. The inhibition of phosphorylation of the 60,000-dalton protein closely paralleled the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake. Neither drug affected the passive permeability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane at concentrations up to 5 times the inhibitory dose, and neither drug inhibited Ca2+ uptake into liposomes reconstituted with the purified Ca2+-ATPase. However, calmodulin-dependent reconstitution of Ca2+ uptake in EGTA-extracted sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was inhibited by 48/80. The results of this study suggest that the calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation system plays a functional role in the coupling of ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ accumulation, perhaps through regulation of Ca2+ release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. Perturbation of phosphorylation by 48/80 and calmidazolium may lead to enhanced Ca2+ release, thereby diminishing Ca2+ accumulation without affecting the Ca2+ uptake mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1536965886,"A Ca2+-ATPase from human platelets has been purified after solubilization with octyl glucoside. Following chromatography on Sepharose 4B and hydroxylapatite the Ca2+-ATPase had a specific activity of 1.1 mumol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein at 30 degrees C. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that 80% of the preparation was a polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 100,000. The major contaminant had a molecular weight of 89,000, and both proteins cross-reacted with anti-serum against the Ca2+-ATPase from rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is likely that the 89,000-dalton polypeptide is an inactive proteolysis product of the Ca2+-ATPase. The kinetic properties of the purified ATPase with Ca2+ and MgATP were quite similar to those of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase. Ca2+ transport activity was reconstituted by dialysis of the octyl glucoside. The platelet Ca2+ pump transported 2 Ca2+ for each ATP molecule hydrolyzed. Thus the platelet Ca2+ pump is similar to the ATPase from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in structure and function. Furthermore, the Ca2+ pump is a major membrane component in platelet membranes, and this emphasizes the importance of Ca2+ fluxes in platelet function."

https://openalex.org/W1569758002,"The proton ATPase of rat liver mitochondria has been purified by a simple procedure which involves the use of the novel, zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate to solubilize the membrane-bound complex. The purified enzyme has a high, oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity (11.3 +/- 2.9 mumol/min/mg) in the absence of added phospholipids. It shows, in four different gel electrophoretic systems, the five bands characteristic of the F1 portion of the complex and three additional Coomassie blue-stainable bands which have apparent molecular weights of 28,000, 19,000, and 13,600. A fourth Coomassie blue-stainable component of about 10,000-12,500 daltons comigrates with the delta subunit, whereas a fifth component, detectable only by absorption at 280 nm, is observed between the dye front and the 10,000-dalton species. The enzyme complex has been reconstituted into liposomal vesicles of asolectin. Under these conditions the enzyme catalyzes an ATP-Pi exchange reaction and is capable of translocating protons in an ATP-dependent manner as assayed by quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine. Both activities are inhibited by the addition of oligomycin, uncoupler, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and cadmium. At high detergent concentration, the complex appears in negative stain electron microscopy in a dispersed state. The tripartite structure is clearly visible in monomeric, dimeric, or trimeric forms of the molecule. At the low detergent concentration, the proton ATPase tends to cluster into densely packed arrays. This represents the first report of the properties of a functionally active proton ATPase solubilized and purified in the presence of a zwitterionic detergent."
https://openalex.org/W1551532611,"Coupling of Ca2+ transport to ATP hydrolysis by isolated skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles has been investigated by means of ATP pulse methods. The stoichiometric amounts of Ca2+ transported per pulse of ATP were measured by Ca2+-stat methods, using either a Ca2+ electrode or arsenazo III as end point detectors, or by means of 45CaCl2. Maximum coupling ratios (Ca2+/ATP), of 1.82 +/- 0.13 occurred at pH 6.8, 25 degrees C, and in the presence of saturating Ca2+ concentrations. Ca2+/ATP values decreased at alkaline pH, with an apparent pK alpha of 7.9. The coupling ratio was unaltered between 6 and 30 degrees C, but decreased to 0.4 at 42 degrees C. Uncoupling by alkaline pH and high temperatures was reversible. The coupling process was Ca2+-dependent, with a K0.5 value for Ca2+ of 0.12 microM and a Hill coefficient of 2.0. Ca2+ ions, which were transported into vesicles under conditions resulting in low coupling ratios, were retained as the calcium oxalate precipitate, following complete hydrolysis of substrate. Passive Ca2+ efflux and Ca2+ exchange, were independent of pH. The observed variations in Ca2+/ATP ratio cannot readily be explained on the basis of a pump-leak model. Rather, the Ca2+-ATPase appears to be capable of pumping Ca2+ ions, under physiological conditions, with variable stoichiometry that is dependent upon its thermodynamic loading."
https://openalex.org/W1574256091,"The mechanistic stoichiometry of vectorial H+ translocation coupled to succinate oxidation by rat liver mitochondria in the presence of a permeant cation has been determined under level flow conditions with a membraneless fast responding O2 electrode kinetically matched with a glass pH electrode. The reactions were initiated by rapid injection of O2 into the anaerobically preincubated test system under conditions in which interfering H+ backflow was minimized. The rates of O2 uptake and H+ ejection, obtained from computer-fitted regression lines, were monotonic and first order over 75% of the course of O2 consumption. Extrapolation of the observed rates to zero time, at which zero delta mu H+ and thus level flow prevails, yielded vectorial H+/O flow ratios above 7 and closely approaching 8. The mitochondria undergo no irreversible change and give identical H+/O ratios on repeated tests. In a further refinement, the lower and upper limits of the mechanistic H+/O ratio were determined to be 7.55 and 8.56, respectively, from plots of the rates of O2 uptake versus H+ ejection at increasing malonate and increasing valinomycin concentrations, respectively. It is therefore concluded that the mechanistic H+/O ratio for energy-conserving sites 2 + 3 is 8, in confirmation of earlier measurements. KCl concentration is critical for maximal observed H+/O ratios. Optimum conditions and possible errors in determination of mechanistic H+/O translocation ratios are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1521944811,"The F0F1-ATPase of the inner mitochondrial membrane catalyzes the conversion of a proton electrochemical energy into the chemical bond energy of ATP (Boyer, P.D., Chance, B., Ernster, L., Mitchell, P., Racker, E., and Slater, E.C. (1977) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 46, 955-1026). To assess the role of the membrane potential (delta psi) in this process and to study the effect of very short pulses on ATP synthesis, we employed a high voltage pulsation method (Kinosita, K., and Tsong, T.Y. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 1923-1927) to induce a delta psi of controlled magnitude and duration in a suspension of submitochondrial particles and F0F1-ATPase vesicles. Cyanide-treated submitochondrial particles were exposed to electric pulses of 10-30 kV/cm of magnitude (generating a peak delta psi of 150-450 mV) and 1-100 microseconds duration. Net [32P]ATP synthesis from [32P]Pi and ADP was observed with maximal values of 410 pmol/mg X pulse for a 30 kV/cm-100-microseconds pulse. This corresponds to a yield of 10-12 mol of ATP per mol of F0F1 complex per pulse. As many as 4 nmol/mg were produced after pulsing the same sample 8 times. By varying the ionic strength of the suspending medium, and consequently the pulse width, it is clearly shown that the synthesis was electrically driven and did not correlate with Joule heating of the sample. Titrations using specific inhibitors and ionophores were performed. The voltage-induced ATP synthesis was 50% inhibited by 0.11 microgram/mg of oligomycin and 2.4 nmol/mg of N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Ionophores and uncouplers had varying degrees of inhibition. The dependence of ATP synthesis on pulse width was nonlinear, exhibiting a threshold at 10 microseconds and a biphasic behavior above this value. Isolated F0F1-ATPase reconstituted into asolectin vesicles also synthesized ATP when pulsed with electric fields. A 35 kV/cm pulse induced the synthesis of 115 pmol of ATP per mg of protein, which corresponds to approximately 0.34 mol of ATP per mol of F0F1-ATPase. This synthesis was also sensitive to oligomycin and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The possibility of turnover of the ATPase in microseconds is considered."
https://openalex.org/W2146021843,"Substratum adhesion sites from murine Balb/c SVT2 fibroblasts are enriched in heparan sulfate proteoglycans which have been implicated in mediating adhesion of these cells to a fibronectin-adsorbed tissue culture substratum. Most of the heparan sulfate isolated from newly formed adhesion sites is found covalently attached to protein as proteoglycan while a significant portion of heparan sulfate from older sites has been identified as a single-chain species. This observation suggests that there may be catabolism of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan during the maturation of these adhesion sites at the cell's undersurface. Zwittergent 3-12 selectively extracts the single-chain class of heparan sulfate from either newly formed or mature adhesion sites while leaving the proteoglycan firmly bound in these sites. In an effort to further characterize the metabolism of these proteoglycans, substratum adhesion sites were isolated at various times after the cells had been pulse-radiolabeled using radioactive sulfate and subsequently chased. Greater than 80% of the sulfate-radiolabeled material is lost from the substratum-attached material within 24-48 h. Characterization of both the Zwittergent-soluble and -resistant heparan sulfate indicated that there was an initial accumulation followed by a rapid loss of a portion of the radiolabeled heparan sulfate as the single-chain Zwittergent-soluble class. However, most of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan was lost from the adhesion sites following approximately a 4-h time lag during the chase period without going through a smaller molecular weight intermediate. The turnover properties of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan in the EGTA-detachable cells were different from those in the substratum-attached fraction of the cell. The significance of these two different mechanisms of turnover of heparan sulfate proteoglycan in adhesion sites is discussed in relation to the role of this proteoglycan in mediating adhesion processes."

https://openalex.org/W1542723664,"Human erythrocyte ankyrin was cleaved by restricted proteolysis at 0 degrees C into two distinct chemical domains. The site on ankyrin that binds spectrin was found to be within a 55,000-dalton domain by spectrin affinity chromatography and co-sedimentation with spectrin in a sucrose gradient. A 32,000-dalton fragment of this domain was prepared (tryptic digest, 0 degrees C, 24 h), separated by gel filtration, and shown to inhibit spectrin binding to the membrane. By comparison with previous two-dimensional peptide maps, the spectrin-binding site was located within this 32,000-dalton fragment near the end of the molecule. The band 3-binding site was identified within an 82,000-dalton domain by binding to a band 3 affinity column. Gel electrophoresis in the absence of detergents confirmed these results and demonstrated that a peptide from the cytoplasmic portion of band 3 retained the capacity to bind the 82,000-dalton domain. The binding properties of the structural domains of ankyrin were correlated with a determination of the affinity constant of the intact molecule. Ankyrin bound with a high affinity to the cytoplasmic portion of band 3 (KD = 8 X 10(-8) M) and to spectrin tetramer (KD = 1 X 10(-7) M) but less so to spectrin dimer (KD = 1 X 10(-6) M). These findings are summarized in a preliminary structural and functional model of ankyrin's role in linking spectrin to the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1545038961,"The outer membrane protein LambB from Escherichia coli has been crystallized from detergent-containing solutions. Several different crystal habits can be obtained under the same ionic and precipitant conditions by altering the detergent head group composition of the protein-detergent mixed micelle or by adding polar organic compounds. Two crystal forms have been partially characterized as P1 and C2221, the former diffracting to beyond 4 A resolution and the latter to 6 A. The detergents used were beta-octyl glucoside, octyl tetraoxyethylene, and octyl polyoxyethylene (polydisperse) either alone or as mixtures. In some experiments, the addition of small nonionic amphiphiles having n-butyl alkyl tails significantly influenced crystallization. The experiments suggest that the detergent region of the mixed micelle plays a critical role in crystal formation. Using the methods developed here for LamB and also for matrix porin (Garavito, R. M., Jenkins, J. A., Jansonius, J. N., Karlsson, R., and Rosenbusch, J. P. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 164, 313-327), an additional protein from the outer membrane, OmpA, has been obtained as a microcrystalline preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2154858275,"Abstract Effect of divalent cations bound to the phosphoenzyme intermediate of the ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum was investigated at 0 degree C and pH 7.0 using the purified ATPase preparations. Our previous study (Shigekawa, M., Wakabayashi, S., and Nakamura, H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14157-14161) indicated that 1 mol of the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1P) formed from CaATP has 3 mol of high affinity binding sites for Ca2+, of which two are transport sites for calcium while the remainder is the acceptor site for calcium derived from the substrate, CaATP (substrate site). When incubated with a chelator of divalent cation, E1P formed from CaATP released all of its bound calcium to form a divalent cation-free phosphoenzyme. Evidence was presented that calcium dissociation from the substrate site was faster than that from the transport sites and primarily responsible for the ADP sensitivity loss of E1P induced by the chelator. Divalent cation-free phosphoenzyme was kinetically stable but when treated with divalent cations, it behaved similarly to the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme (E2P) which is the normal reaction intermediate of ATP hydrolysis. 45Ca bound at the substrate site on E1P formed from 45CaATP exchanged readily with nonradioactive ionized Ca2+ in the reaction medium whereas 45Ca at the transport sites on E1P was displaced only at a very slow rate which was almost the same as that for the phosphoenzyme hydrolysis. It was suggested that calcium at the transport sites on E1P formed from CaATP is released only after the rate-limiting conformational transition of the phosphoenzyme from E1P to E2P and that removal of calcium by a chelator from the substrate site facilitates this conformational transition, thereby allowing calcium bound at the transport sites to be released readily from the phosphoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1582762105,"The structural organization of the high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E has been investigated in plasma membrane vesicles from rat basophilic leukemia cells using lactoperoxidase-catalyzed 125I-iodination to label exposed polypeptide regions. Intact vesicles are predominantly right-side-out in orientation, and lactoperoxidase iodination of these vesicles results in labeling of the alpha subunit of receptor but not the beta and gamma subunits. Lysis of these vesicles to expose the cytoplasmic face of the membrane by two different methods permits labeling of the beta and gamma subunits with no increase in labeling of alpha. The results indicate that both the beta and gamma subunits of the receptor have segments exposed at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. These studies have also revealed a previously unidentified IgE binding component in the membrane vesicles; its 125I-labeling characteristics and some other properties are described."
https://openalex.org/W1505896616,"Actin from amebae of Naegleria gruberi has been purified to homogeneity. The purified actin shares many attributes with numerous other actins that have been characterized, including molecular weight, strong binding to DEAE-cellulose, binding to DNase I, reversible polymerization to F-actin, binding of rabbit myosin subfragment 1 to give distinctive arrowheads , formation of Mg paracrystals, and activation of myosin Mg2+-ATPase. In two respects the attributes of Naegleria actin are unusual. Isoelectric focusing resolves three distinct isoforms of the actin, which raises questions about the function of multiple isoforms in a unicellular eukaryote. The amino acid composition closely resembles other actins except that Naegleria actin lacks N tau-methylhistidine. This result indicates that N tau-methylhistidine is not a prerequisite for actin-actin or actin-myosin interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2168462925,"Direct excitation of lanthanide luminescence with a pulsed dye laser has been used to probe the molecular environment of the high affinity sites of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. The direct excitation spectrum of Tb3+ bound to these sites has been determined and a luminescence lifetime of approximately 1 ms measured. Measurements of the difference in lifetime of the Tb X ATPase complex in H2O and D2O indicate that there are approximately 2 H2O molecules in the first coordination sphere of Tb3+ bound at the high affinity sites of the ATPase. The results are compared with the properties of Tb3+ binding to high affinity sites of other Ca2+ binding proteins. The binding constant of Tb3+ to the ATPase is in the range of 0.3-5.0 X 10(8) M-1 as inferred from the KI for inhibition of ATP hydrolysis, in agreement with a previous report (Highsmith, S. R., and Head, M. R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6858-6862). The values of the Ca2+ binding constant (approximately 2 X 10(6) M-1) and the cooperative nature (n = 1.9) of Ca2+ protection of Tb3+ inhibition indicate that Tb3+ and Ca2+ compete for the high affinity sites of the ATPase. The results demonstrate that directly-excited Tb3+ luminescence provides unique information on the environment of the Ca2+ binding-transport sites of the SR ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1528412303,"The kinetic mechanisms of Escherichia coli phosphofructokinase-2 (Pfk-2) and of the mutant enzyme Pfk-2 were investigated. Initial velocity studies showed that both enzymes have a sequential kinetic mechanism, indicating that both substrates must bind to the enzyme before any products are released. For Pfk-2, the product inhibition kinetics was as follows: fructose-1,6-P2 was a competitive inhibitor versus fructose-6-P at two ATP concentrations (0.1 and 0.4 mM), and noncompetitive versus ATP. The other product inhibition patterns, ADP versus either ATP or fructose-6-P were noncompetitive. Dead-end inhibition studies with an ATP analogue, adenylyl imidodiphosphate, showed uncompetitive inhibition when fructose-6-P was the varied substrate. For Pfk-2, the product inhibition studies revealed that ADP was a competitive inhibitor versus ATP at two fructose-6-P concentrations (0.05 and 0.5 mM), and noncompetitive versus fructose-6-P. The other product, fructose-1, 6-P2, showed noncompetitive inhibition versus both substrates, ATP and fructose-6-P. Sorbitol-6-P, a dead-end inhibitor, exhibited competitive inhibition versus fructose-6-P and uncompetitive versus ATP. These results are in accordance with an Ordered Bi Bi reaction mechanism for both enzymes. In the case of Pfk-2, fructose-6-P would be the first substrate to bind to the enzyme, and fructose-1,6-P2 the last product to be released. For Pfk-2, ATP would be the first substrate to bind to the enzyme, and APD the last product to be released."

Certain hypotheses can be tested by examining whether the first nucleotide inserted is incorporated with a significantly higher error rate than subsequent nucleotides. Using synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, we have measured the effect of primer position on single-base misinsertion frequencies at an amber site in phi X174 DNA. Our results show a lack of position effect, indicating that processivity and the most direct energy relay proofreading mechanisms are not important determinants in eucaryotic replication fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W1573835097,"H-protein, a rabbit skeletal muscle myofibrillar component, was isolated and characterized. Its content in the myofibril is about 0.3 to 0.4%. H-protein is located at a specific site in the A-band, which is closer to the M-line than the C-protein zone. Anti-H-protein serum does not react with either C-protein or purified myosin in an Ouchterlony immunodiffusion plate. Immunoblotting experiments show H-protein is an intrinsic component of the myofibril. Its molecular weight, estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is 74,000. One characteristic of its amino acid composition is a high proline content, similar to C-protein. Its sedimentation coefficient is 2.5 S. H-protein binds to myosin; however, C-protein can still bind to myosin even if myosin is saturated by H-protein. Although H-protein itself does not have ATPase activity, it inhibits not only actomyosin ATPase but also acto-heavy meromyosin ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1591198531,"Fodrin, a spectrin-like protein isolated from brain, is a long flexible molecule which binds calmodulin and cross-links F-actin. The effects of fodrin on the actin-activated ATPase of myosin have been examined. When added after ATP, fodrin inhibited the actomyosin ATPase. Two to three times as much fodrin was required for inhibition in the presence of Ca2+ as in its absence. Complete inhibition in the absence of Ca2+ occurred at about one fodrin to 200 actins. Inhibition does not appear to result from fodrin cross-linking F-actin, and, thereby, preventing the myosin filaments from reaching the actin filaments; but cross-linking may promote inhibition by trapping the myosin filaments within the cross-linked F-actin. When added before ATP, fodrin stimulated the actomyosin ATPase almost 3-fold in the presence of Ca2+ and by less than 50% in the absence of Ca2+. Stimulation is thought to result from fodrin cross-linking F-actin. After several minutes the stimulations in Ca2+ were greatly reduced, and in the absence of Ca2+ the actomyosin ATPases were substantially inhibited. Whether added before or after ATP, fodrin inhibited the actin-activated ATPase of myosin subfragment 1. This inhibition was also slightly Ca2+ sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1597001820,"In order to understand the mechanism of action of the activator proteins for the enzymic hydrolysis of GM1 (GM1-activator; Li, S.-C. and Li, Y.-T. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1159-1163; for ganglioside designations, see Svennerholm, L. (1963) J. Neurochem. 10, 613) and GM2 (GM2-activator; Li, S.-C., Hirabayashi, Y., and Li, Y.-T. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 6234-6240), we have studied the effect of chemical modifications of GM1 and GM2 on their susceptibility to the activator-assisted enzymic hydrolysis. Chemically modified GM1 and GM2 were prepared by methyl esterification (Me-GM1 or Me-GM2) and reduction (HO-GM1 or HO-GM2) of the -COO- group of the sialic acid. Me-GM1 and HO-GM1 could be hydrolyzed by human hepatic beta-galactosidase in the presence of GM1-activator at rates comparable to that of the native GM1. However, in contrast to native GM2, Me-GM2 and HO-GM2 were resistant to the hydrolysis by human hepatic beta-hexosaminidase A in the presence of GM2-activator. When GM2-activator was replaced by sodium taurodeoxycholate, the native GM2 and both modified GM2 could be hydrolyzed by beta-hexosaminidase A. These results suggest that the carboxyl function of sialic acid in GM1 is not vital for beta-galactosidase or GM1-activator to carry out the cleavage of the terminal Gal. In the case of GM2 hydrolysis, the carboxyl function of sialic acid is involved in the interaction with GM2-activator. Our results also indicate that the mode of action of GM1-activator is different from that of GM2-activator and that the action of GM2-activator is different from that of sodium taurodeoxycholate."
https://openalex.org/W2035701106,Long-term exposure of C3H mice to ultraviolet radiation resulted in the formation of suppressor T cells that recognize ultraviolet radiation-induced regressor skin cancers as a class before the appearance of overt tumors. Administration of monoclonal antibodies to the product of the I-Jk subregion of the major histocompatibility complex or low doses of cyclophosphamide in vivo inhibited the development or activity of these cells. This activity of the monoclonal antibody was eliminated by adsorption on B10.BR (I-Jk) but not B10.D2 (I-Jd) splenocytes. These findings provide evidence that elements expressing the I-J determinant are important in regulating the host response prior to the overt development of ultraviolet radiation-induced skin cancers and suggest novel therapeutic approaches to malignancies or other diseases involving suppressor T cells in their pathogenesis.
https://openalex.org/W1527419877,"Abstract The coupling factor of oxidative phosphorylation from beef heart mitochondria obtained as a F1, exhibits negligible levels of ATPase activity, contains stoichiometric amounts of the specific F1 inhibitor protein, and is stable to incubation at low temperature (Adolfsen, R., McClung, J.A., and Moudrianakis, E. N. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 1727-1735). Incubation of the latent F1 enzyme at 60 degrees C activates its ATPase activity. We show in this paper that regulation of the interaction of the inhibitor protein with the latent F1 enzyme can be accomplished under more physiological conditions. At 37 degrees C, variations in the proton concentration led to changes in the degree and extent of activation of the enzyme, with maximal activation rates occurring after preincubation at pH 9.6. The energy for the pH 9.6-induced activation process (12.1 kcal/mol) was similar to that reported for the dissociation of the inhibitor protein from the membrane-bound F1 enzyme in energized mitochondria (Gomez-Fernandez, J. C., and Harris, D.A. (1978) Biochem. J. 176, 967-973). The rates of activation were higher in the presence of 5 mM ATP and inhibited by the presence of Mg2+, suggesting the existence of a specific binding site for Mg2+ between the inhibitor subunit and the F1 enzyme. A model is presented in which the activation of the latent F1 enzyme is brought about by a rapid titration of positively charged amino acid residues on the inhibitor subunit, followed by a slow release of a tightly bound Mg2+ atom. This model predicts that the initial event leading to the appearance of ATP synthesis is the deprotonation of the inhibitor subunit and that the onset of ATPase activity in mitochondria is due to sequestering of the available free Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W2124702944,"Adenosine triphosphatase activity which is Mg2+-dependent and stimulated by submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ (as Ca . ATP) was identified in the total particulate fraction of rat pancreatic acini. Half-maximal activity (V0.5) is obtained at 100.1 +/- 6 nM Ca . ATP with a Hill coefficient of 2.2 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- S.E.; n = 4). Maximal activity was 75 +/- 19 pmol of Pi released from ATP minute-1 microgram of membrane protein-1 (mean +/- S.E.; n = 7). High affinity Ca2+-ATPase activity was unaffected by ouabain, Na+, K+, La3+, and added calmodulin. Activity was slightly reduced by ruthenium red (0.1 mM) and by oligomycin (80 micrograms/ml) but was reduced almost 50% by the phenothiazine derivative fluphenazine in a dose-related and Ca2+-dependent manner. Hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate was 9% of the rate of ATP hydrolysis and was independent of Ca2+ concentration. However, ADP, GTP, UTP, and ITP were hydrolyzed at 76-93% the rate that ATP was hydrolyzed with V0.5 values and Hill coefficients similar to those of Ca . ATP. We conclude that rat pancreatic acini contain an enzyme for active Ca2+ translocation: ATPase activity that is Mg2+-dependent and stimulated by submicromolar concentrations of Ca . ATP. Substrate hydrolysis appears to involve positive cooperative interactions of multiple ligand-binding sites and may be regulated in part by calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1523976425,"Adult beta-globin gene chromatin in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells acquired increased sensitivity to both micrococcal nuclease and DNase I during hexamethylenebisacetamide-induced erythoid differentiation. The DNase I hypersensitivity of the globin genes accompanied their actual transcription and was strongly correlated with commitment events. On the other hand, the rate of micrococcal nuclease digestion was closely related to the rate of globin gene transcription. Two distinct DNase I hypersensitive sites were found on the 5' side of the beta-major globin gene in HMBA-induced cells. One site was located near the 5' side of the beta-major globin gene and the second site was located approximately 3 kilobases upstream of the beta-major cap site. Following the commitment of MEL cells to differentiate, DNase I sensitivity was stably inherited in the absence of inducer. In contrast to HMBA, another inducer, hemin, known to cause the accumulation of globin-specific mRNA in MEL cells by a post-transcriptional mechanism, did not elicit alterations of beta-globin gene chromatin. The addition of dexamethasone, a hormone known to inhibit MEL cell commitment, blocked the formation of general and site-specific nuclease sensitivity of beta-globin gene chromatin prior to but not after cell commitment."
https://openalex.org/W1560272770,"Amino acid analysis of the halorhodopsin chromoprotein shows that this protein contains a cysteine residue. Such a residue is absent in bacteriorhodopsin. Low concentrations (micromolar) of HgCl2 inhibit light-dependent chloride transport by halorhodopsin in envelope vesicles prepared from Halobacterium halobium strain L-33 and increase the Km for chloride. The decay rate of the flash-induced absorption change of halorhodopsin, measured at 570 nm, is considerably slowed by HgCl2, and this effect is reversed at higher concentrations of chloride. In addition, the magnitude of the absorption changes is diminished by HgCl2. These effects of the mercurial are also seen with the purified, solubilized chromoprotein. Upon addition of HgCl2 to the chromoprotein at low chloride concentrations in the dark, a decrease of absorption at 580 nm and an increase at 380 nm occur, as well as a blue shift of the chromophore by about 20 nm. Sustained illumination of halorhodopsin results in a 410 nm photoproduct. The reconversion of this species to 580 nm in the dark is strongly inhibited by HgCl2. These results show that a thiol group is essential for the stability of the halorhodopsin chromophore and for its photochemical reactions and suggest that this group is in the vicinity of both the retinal Schiff's base and the chloride-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1520133245,"Abstract The allosteric phosphofructokinase from Escherichia coli has been renatured after complete unfolding in concentrated guanidine hydrochloride. The enzyme regains both its catalytic and regulatory abilities quantitatively. The kinetics of reactivation are biphasic and are consistent with a two-step mechanism in which a monomolecular reaction precedes a bimolecular one. The presence of ATP during reactivation increases the rate at which phosphofructokinase is renatured; the second order rate constant of the bimolecular step increases from about 10(4) M-1 S-1 in the absence of ATP to about 2 X 10(5) M-1 S-1 in the presence of 1 mM ATP. The other ligands of the enzyme have no effect on reactivation. It is tentatively proposed that a folded monomer is the intermediate species which already possesses a functional ATP-binding site and that the rate-limiting association step is the formation of dimeric species. This interpretation is compatible with the known three-dimensional structure of another bacterial phosphofructokinase, that from Bacillus stearothermophilus."
https://openalex.org/W1522886649,"Physarum contains at least two distinct DNase I-binding proteins, i.e. actin and Cap 42 (a + b). The latter, a tight (1:1) complex of Cap 42 (a) and Cap 42 (b) (Maruta, H., Isenberg. G., Schreckenbach, T., Hallmann, R., Risse, G., Schibayama, T., and Hesse, J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10144-10150), is a Ca2+-dependent F-actin capping protein. DNase I binds to Cap 42 (b) but not to Cap 42 (a). Consequently, DNase I-agarose was used for an affinity-purification of Cap 42 (a + b), after its separation from actin by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Cap 42 (a + b) was dissociated into its subunits when released from DNase I-agarose by 8.8 M formamide. The two subunits were subsequently separated from each other on hydroxylapatite. Both Cap 42 (a) and Cap 42 (b) were Ca2+-dependent F-actin capping proteins that cap the fast growing end of actin filaments and block actin polymerization at this end. Like Cap 42 (a + b), Cap 42 (b) required Ca2+ for its capping activity only when phosphorylated. The phosphorylation of Cap 42 (b) was completely blocked by DNase I or a tertiary complex of Cap 42 (a), actin, and Ca2+. Cap 42 (b) is not identical with native (= polymerizable) actin because (i) Cap 42 (b) was unable to form filaments, (ii) the Cap 42 (b) kinase did not phosphorylate native actin, and (iii) fragmin formed a tight (1:1) complex with native actin but not with Cap 42 (b). Although it is unlikely that Cap 42 (b) is simply a denatured form of actin that has lost its polymerizability during the preparation, it still remains to be clarified whether Cap 42 (b) is a nonpolmerizable actin variant derived from a distinct actin gene or a post-translationally modified form of polymerizable actin."

Micrococcal nuclease digestion of the nick translated nuclei was followed by a low ionic strength gel electrophoresis system which separates different types of mononucleosomes. The major label was observed in the vicinity of high mobility group protein containing mononucleosomes. However, further analysis revealed that the particle does not sediment in the position of mononucleosomes on a sucrose gradient. Two alternative explanations are discussed as the possible source of this particle. It is either a high mobility group protein containing nucleosome in some unfolded conformation or the labeled particle originates from discrete DNA fragments, wrapped around some nonhistone proteins, located in a highly DNase I-sensitive region, which is resistant to micrococcal nuclease digestion."
