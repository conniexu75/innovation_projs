This array provides feedback and helps us to avoid a hot object or increase the strength of our grip on an object that may be slipping away. Tee et al. describe an approach to simulate the mechanoreceptors of human skin, using pressure-sensitive foils and printed ring oscillators (see the Perspective by Anikeeva and Koppes). The sensor successfully converted pressure into a digital response in a pressure range comparable to that found in a human grip. Science , this issue p. 313 ; see also p. 274"

Pluto's surface displays diverse landforms, terrain ages, albedos, colors, and composition gradients. Evidence is found for a water-ice crust, geologically young surface units, surface ice convection, wind streaks, volatile transport, and glacial flow. Pluto's atmosphere is highly extended, with trace hydrocarbons, a global haze layer, and a surface pressure near 10 microbars. Pluto's diverse surface geology and long-term activity raise fundamental questions about how small planets remain active many billions of years after formation. Pluto's large moon Charon displays tectonics and evidence for a heterogeneous crustal composition, its north pole displays puzzling dark terrain. Small satellites Hydra and Nix have higher albedos than expected."
https://openalex.org/W2145502498,"Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a hallmark of gene silencing. Here we report the crystal structures of an active PRC2 complex of 170 kilodaltons from the yeast Chaetomium thermophilum in both basal and stimulated states, which contain Ezh2, Eed, and the VEFS domain of Suz12 and are bound to a cancer-associated inhibiting H3K27M peptide and a S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine cofactor. The stimulated complex also contains an additional stimulating H3K27me3 peptide. Eed is engulfed by a belt-like structure of Ezh2, and Suz12(VEFS) contacts both of these two subunits to confer an unusual split active SET domain for catalysis. Comparison of PRC2 in the basal and stimulated states reveals a mobile Ezh2 motif that responds to stimulation to allosterically regulate the active site."

https://openalex.org/W2191493147,"The maintenance of immune homeostasis requires regulatory T cells (T(regs)). Given their intrinsic self-reactivity, T(regs) must stably maintain a suppressive phenotype to avoid autoimmunity. We report that impaired expression of the transcription factor (TF) Helios by FoxP3(+) CD4 and Qa-1-restricted CD8 T(regs) results in defective regulatory activity and autoimmunity in mice. Helios-deficient T(regs) develop an unstable phenotype during inflammatory responses characterized by reduced FoxP3 expression and increased effector cytokine expression secondary to diminished activation of the STAT5 pathway. CD8 T(regs) also require Helios-dependent STAT5 activation for survival and to prevent terminal T cell differentiation. The definition of Helios as a key transcription factor that stabilizes T(regs) in the face of inflammatory responses provides a genetic explanation for a core property of T(regs)."
https://openalex.org/W2242446634,"The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is a major mode of climate variability with important societal impacts. Most previous explanations identify the driver of the AMO as the ocean circulation, specifically the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Here we show that the main features of the observed AMO are reproduced in models where the ocean heat transport is prescribed and thus cannot be the driver. Allowing the ocean circulation to interact with the atmosphere does not significantly alter the characteristics of the AMO in the current generation of climate models. These results suggest that the AMO is the response to stochastic forcing from the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation, with thermal coupling playing a role in the tropics. In this view, the AMOC and other ocean circulation changes would be largely a response to, not a cause of, the AMO."
https://openalex.org/W2308616703,"Transcriptional enhancers direct precise on-off patterns of gene expression during development. To explore the basis for this precision, we conducted a high-throughput analysis of the Otx-a enhancer, which mediates expression in the neural plate of Ciona embryos in response to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and a localized GATA determinant. We provide evidence that enhancer specificity depends on submaximal recognition motifs having reduced binding affinities (""suboptimization""). Native GATA and ETS (FGF) binding sites contain imperfect matches to consensus motifs. Perfect matches mediate robust but ectopic patterns of gene expression. The native sites are not arranged at optimal intervals, and subtle changes in their spacing alter enhancer activity. Multiple tiers of enhancer suboptimization produce specific, but weak, patterns of expression, and we suggest that clusters of weak enhancers, including certain ""superenhancers,"" circumvent this trade-off in specificity and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2273847944,"The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is a small RNA-based innate immune system that defends germ cell genomes against transposons. In Drosophila ovaries, the nuclear Piwi protein is required for transcriptional silencing of transposons, though the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Here we show that the CG9754 protein is a component of Piwi complexes that functions downstream of Piwi and its binding partner, Asterix, in transcriptional silencing. Enforced tethering of CG9754 to nascent messenger RNA transcripts causes cotranscriptional silencing of the source locus and the deposition of repressive chromatin marks. We have named CG9754 ""Panoramix,"" and we propose that this protein could act as an adaptor, scaffolding interactions between the piRNA pathway and the general silencing machinery that it recruits to enforce transcriptional repression."
https://openalex.org/W2225257929,"Neural stem cells show age-dependent developmental potentials, as evidenced by their production of distinct neuron types at different developmental times. Drosophila neuroblasts produce long, stereotyped lineages of neurons. We searched for factors that could regulate neural temporal fate by RNA-sequencing lineage-specific neuroblasts at various developmental times. We found that two RNA-binding proteins, IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (Imp) and Syncrip (Syp), display opposing high-to-low and low-to-high temporal gradients with lineage-specific temporal dynamics. Imp and Syp promote early and late fates, respectively, in both a slowly progressing and a rapidly changing lineage. Imp and Syp control neuronal fates in the mushroom body lineages by regulating the temporal transcription factor Chinmo translation. Together, the opposing Imp/Syp gradients encode stem cell age, specifying multiple cell fates within a lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2136526381,"The cellular synthesis site and ensuing storage location for human factor VIII (FVIII), the coagulation protein deficient in hemophilia A, has been elusive. FVIII stability and half-life is dependent on non-covalent complex formation with von Willebrand factor (VWF) to avoid proteolysis and clearance. VWF is synthesized in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells, and is stored and secreted from platelet alpha granules and Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells. In this paper we provide direct evidence for FVIII synthesis in 2 types of primary human endothelial cells: glomerular microvascular endothelial cells (GMVECs) and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Gene expression quantified by real time PCR revealed that levels of F8 and VWF are similar in GMVECs and HUVECs. Previous clinical studies have shown that stimulation of vasopressin V2 receptors causes parallel secretion of both proteins. In this study, we found that both endothelial cell types express AVPR2 (vasopressin V2 receptor gene) and that AVPR2 mRNA levels are 5-fold higher in GMVECs than HUVECs. FVIII and VWF proteins were detected by fluorescent microscopy in Weibel-Palade bodies within GMVECs and HUVECs using antibodies proven to be target specific. Visual presence of FVIII and VWF in Weibel-Palade bodies was confirmed by correlation measurements. The high extent of correlation was compared with negative correlation values obtained from FVIII detection with cytoplasmic proteins, β-actin and Factor H. FVIII activity was positive in GMVEC and HUVEC cell lysates. Stimulated GMVECs and HUVECs were found to secrete cell-anchored ultra-large VWF strings covered with bound FVIII."

One of the mechanisms underlying this process is the expression of so-called stress-inducible immunostimulating ligands. Although the activating receptor NKG2D has been proven to play roles in tumor therapy through targeting its ligands, the role of NKp30, another key activating receptor, is seldom addressed. In this study, we found that the NKp30 ligand B7-H6 was widely expressed in tumor cells and closely correlated to their susceptibility to NK cell lysis. Further studies showed that treatment of tumor cells with almost all standard tumor therapeutics, including chemotherapy (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil), radiation therapy, non-lethal heat shock, and cytokine therapy (TNF-α), could up-regulate the expression of B7-H6 in tumor cells and enhance tumor sensitivity to NK cell cytolysis. B7-H6 shRNA treatment effectively dampened sensitization of tumor cells to NK-mediated lysis. Our study not only reveals the possibility that tumor therapeutics work as stress inducers to enhance tumor sensitivity to NK cell cytolysis but also suggests that B7-H6 could be a potential target for tumor therapy in the future.

https://openalex.org/W2285040145,"The interaction between advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and receptor of AGEs (RAGE) is associated with the development and progression of diabetes-associated osteoporosis, but the mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. In this study, we found that AGE-modified bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) induced a biphasic effect on the viability of hFOB1.19 cells; cell proliferation was stimulated after exposure to low dose AGE-BSA, but cell apoptosis was stimulated after exposure to high dose AGE-BSA. The low dose AGE-BSA facilitates proliferation of hFOB1.19 cells by concomitantly promoting autophagy, RAGE production, and the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway activation. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of AGE-BSA on the function of hFOB1.19 cells. Interestingly, the results suggest that the short term effects of low dose AGE-BSA increase osteogenic function and decrease osteoclastogenic function, which are likely mediated by autophagy and the RAGE/Raf/MEK/ERK signal pathway. In contrast, with increased treatment time, the opposite effects were observed. Collectively, AGE-BSA had a biphasic effect on the viability of hFOB1.19 cells in vitro, which was determined by the concentration of AGE-BSA and treatment time. A low concentration of AGE-BSA activated the Raf/MEK/ERK signal pathway through the interaction with RAGE, induced autophagy, and regulated the proliferation and function of hFOB1.19 cells."

https://openalex.org/W2108217314,"The latest guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) to test Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cancer after being revised in 2008 underwent a second modification in October 2013. The modification includes changes in cut-offs: 10% strong membranous staining for score 3+ on immunohistochemistry (IHC) (previously 30%) and using the ratio of >2 or absolute gene-copy-number (6 or more) alone or in combination with each other by in-situ-hybridisation technology (previously >2.2 and average copy-number of 6 or more). Hereby we addressed the question, which impact the modified cut-offs had on overall HER2-positivity in a single institution.We prospectively analysed 617 consecutive diagnostic breast-cancer cases which underwent double HER2 testing by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH), using the modified 2013 ASCO/CAP-guidelines for one year (October 2013-October 2014). Results were compared with HER2-test results on 1,528 consecutive diagnostic breast-cancer cases from two previous years (2011-2012), using the 2008 ASCO/CAP guidelines, also tested with IHC and FISH in each case.Between October 2013 and October 2014, overall HER2-positivity was 15.8% (98 of 617 cases were either IHC 3+ or FISH amplified). 79 of 617 cases (13%) were IHC 3+, 96 of 617 cases (15.5%) were FISH amplified. Equivocal cases were seen in 25 of 617 cases (4.1%). 22 of 25 equivocal cases (88%) in 2013-2014 were IHC 1+ or 2+. In 13 equivocal cases, there was a repeated IHC/FISH testing: 2 of 13 cases (15%) became FISH amplified, 1 of 13 cases (7.5%) became IHC 3+. In 2011-2012, overall HER2-positivity (IHC/FISH) was 13.8% (211 of 1,528 cases). 185 of 1,528 cases (12%) were 3+ on IHC, 181 of 1,522 cases (12%) were amplified by FISH. Six of 1,528 cases were equivocal by FISH, and interpreted as non-amplified (0.3%).Applying the modified ASCO/CAP guidelines from 2013 resulted in an increase (2%) in overall HER2-positivity rate compared to overall-HER2-positivity rate using the 2008 ASCO/CAP guidelines. The increased positivity rate was mainly due to more FISH-positive cases (3.5% more than until 2013). The high rate of equivocal cases (4.1%) did not contribute to increase in overall HER2-positivity, but resulted in delay in definitive HER2-status."
https://openalex.org/W2192360039,"Many multicomponent protein complexes mediating diverse cellular processes are assembled through scaffolds with specialized protein interaction modules. The multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC), consisting of nine different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and three non-enzymatic factors (AIMP1–3), serves as a hub for many signaling pathways in addition to its role in protein synthesis. However, the assembly process and structural arrangement of the MSC components are not well understood. Here we show the heterotetrameric complex structure of the glutathione transferase (GST) domains shared among the four MSC components, methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MRS), glutaminyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), AIMP2 and AIMP3. The MRS-AIMP3 and EPRS-AIMP2 using interface 1 are bridged via interface 2 of AIMP3 and EPRS to generate a unique linear complex of MRS-AIMP3:EPRS-AIMP2 at the molar ratio of (1:1):(1:1). Interestingly, the affinity at interface 2 of AIMP3:EPRS can be varied depending on the occupancy of interface 1, suggesting the dynamic nature of the linear GST tetramer. The four components are optimally arranged for maximal accommodation of additional domains and proteins. These characteristics suggest the GST tetramer as a unique and dynamic structural platform from which the MSC components are assembled. Considering prevalence of the GST-like domains, this tetramer can also provide a tool for the communication of the MSC with other GST-containing cellular factors."
https://openalex.org/W2280585733,"Human papilloma virus (HPV) associated Head and Neck Cancers (HNCs) have generated significant amount of research interest in recent times. Due to high incidence of HNCs and lack of sufficient data on high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection from North -East region of India, this study was conceived to investigate hr-HPV infection, its types and its association with life style habits such as tobacco, alcohol consumption etc.A total of one hundred and six primary HNC tumor biopsy specimens were collected. These samples were analyzed for hr-HPV DNA (13 HPV types) using hybrid capture 2 (HC2) assay and genotyping was done by E6 nested multiplex PCR (NMPCR).The presence of hr-HPV was confirmed in 31.13% (n = 33) and 24.52% (n = 26) of the HNC patients by nested multiplex PCR (NMPCR) and HC2 assay respectively. Among hr-HPV positive cases, out of thirteen hr- HPV types analyzed, only two prevalent genotypes, HPV-16 (81.81%) followed by HPV-18 (18.18%) were found. Significant association was observed between hr-HPV infection with alcohol consumption (p <0.001) and tobacco chewing (p = 0.02) in HNC cases. Compared to HPV-18 infection the HPV-16 was found to be significantly associated with tobacco chewing (p = 0.02) habit.Our study demonstrated that tobacco chewing and alcohol consumption may act as risk factors for hr-HPV infection in HNCs from the North-East region of India. This was the first study from North-East India which also assessed the clinical applicability of HC2 assay in HNC patient specimens. We suggest that alcohol, tobacco and hr- HPV infection act synergistically or complement each other in the process of HNC development and progression in the present study population."
https://openalex.org/W2212781247,"There is an increasing interest in unveiling the dynamics of parasite infection. Understanding the interaction patterns, and determinants of host-parasite association contributes to filling knowledge gaps in both community and disease ecology. Despite being targeted as a relevant group for conservation efforts, determinants of the association of amphibians and their parasites in broad scales are poorly understood. Here we describe parasite biodiversity in South American amphibians, testing the influence of host body size and geographic range in helminth parasites species richness (PSR). We also test whether parasite diversity is related to hosts' phylogenetic diversity. Results showed that nematodes are the most common anuran parasites. Host-parasite network has a nested pattern, with specialist helminth taxa generally associated with hosts that harbour the richest parasite faunas. Host size is positively correlated with helminth fauna richness, but we found no support for the association of host geographic range and PSR. These results remained consistent after correcting for uneven study effort and hosts' phylogenic correlation. However, we found no association between host and parasite diversity, indicating that more diversified anuran clades not necessarily support higher parasite diversity. Overall, considering both the structure and the determinants of PRS in anurans, we conclude that specialist parasites are more likely to be associated with large anurans, which are the ones harbouring higher PSR, and that the lack of association of PSR with hosts' clade diversification suggests it is strongly influenced by ecological and contemporary constrains."
https://openalex.org/W2238472783,"Background:Mutations in NFATc1 and BMP-2 genes result in bone abnormalities in mice.Results:BMP-2 activates intracellular Ca2+ release, thus activating calcineurin phosphatase to induce NFATc1 expression involving canonical Smad and noncanonical PI 3-kinase in osteoblasts.Conclusion:BMP-2-stimulated Ca2+-calcineurin-NFATc1 axis potentiates osteoblast differentiation.Significance:NFATc1 autoregulates its expression in response to BMP-2 in osteoblasts.Bone remodeling is controlled by dual actions of osteoclasts (OCs) and osteoblasts (OBs). The calcium-sensitive nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c1 transcription factor, as an OC signature gene, regulates differentiation of OCs downstream of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)-stimulated osteoblast-coded factors. To analyze a functional link between BMP-2 and NFATc1, we analyzed bones from OB-specific BMP-2 knock-out mice for NFATc1 expression by immunohistochemical staining and found significant reduction in NFATc1 expression. This indicated a requirement of BMP-2 for NFATc1 expression in OBs. We showed that BMP-2, via the receptor-specific Smad pathway, regulates expression of NFATc1 in OBs. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling acting downstream of BMP-2 also drives NFATc1 expression and transcriptional activation. Under the basal condition, NFATc1 is phosphorylated. Activation of NFAT requires dephosphorylation by the calcium-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin. We examined the role of calcium in BMP-2-stimulated regulation of NFATc1 in osteoblasts. 1,2Bis(2aminophenoxy)ethaneN,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester, an inhibitor of intracellular calcium abundance, blocked BMP-2-induced transcription of NFATc1. Interestingly, BMP-2 induced calcium release from intracellular stores and increased calcineurin phosphatase activity, resulting in NFATc1 nuclear translocation. Cyclosporin A, which inhibits calcineurin upstream of NFATc1, blocked BMP-2-induced NFATc1 mRNA and protein expression. Expression of NFATc1 directly increased its transcription and VIVIT peptide, an inhibitor of NFATc1, suppressed BMP-2-stimulated NFATc1 transcription, confirming its autoregulation. Together, these data show a role of NFATc1 downstream of BMP-2 in mouse bone development and provide novel evidence for the presence of a cross-talk among Smad, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and Ca2+ signaling for BMP-2-induced NFATc1 expression through an autoregulatory loop. Mutations in NFATc1 and BMP-2 genes result in bone abnormalities in mice. BMP-2 activates intracellular Ca2+ release, thus activating calcineurin phosphatase to induce NFATc1 expression involving canonical Smad and noncanonical PI 3-kinase in osteoblasts. BMP-2-stimulated Ca2+-calcineurin-NFATc1 axis potentiates osteoblast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2281317375,"Low birth weight is associated with both short term problems and the fetal programming of adult onset diseases, including an increased risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Placental insufficiency leading to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) contributes to the prevalence of diseases with developmental origins. Currently there are no therapies for IUGR or placental insufficiency. To address this and move towards development of an in utero therapy, we employ a nanostructure delivery system complexed with the IGF-1 gene to treat the placenta. IGF-1 is a growth factor critical to achieving appropriate placental and fetal growth. Delivery of genes to a model of human trophoblast and mouse placenta was achieved using a diblock copolymer (pHPMA-b-pDMAEMA) complexed to hIGF-1 plasmid DNA under the control of trophoblast-specific promoters (Cyp19a or PLAC1). Transfection efficiency of pEGFP-C1-containing nanocarriers in BeWo cells and non-trophoblast cells was visually assessed via fluorescence microscopy. In vivo transfection and functionality was assessed by direct placental-injection into a mouse model of IUGR. Complexes formed using pHPMA-b-pDMAEMA and CYP19a-923 or PLAC1-modified plasmids induce trophoblast-selective transgene expression in vitro, and placental injection of PLAC1-hIGF-1 produces measurable RNA expression and alleviates IUGR in our mouse model, consequently representing innovative building blocks towards human placental gene therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2216167094,"We investigated the potential plant growth-promoting traits of 377 culturable endophytic bacteria, isolated from Vitis vinifera cv. Glera, as good biofertilizer candidates in vineyard management. Endophyte ability in promoting plant growth was assessed in vitro by testing ammonia production, phosphate solubilization, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and IAA-like molecule biosynthesis, siderophore and lytic enzyme secretion. Many of the isolates were able to mobilize phosphate (33%), release ammonium (39%), secrete siderophores (38%) and a limited part of them synthetized IAA and IAA-like molecules (5%). Effects of each of the 377 grapevine beneficial bacteria on Arabidopsis thaliana root development were also analyzed to discern plant growth-promoting abilities (PGP) of the different strains, that often exhibit more than one PGP trait. A supervised model-based clustering analysis highlighted six different classes of PGP effects on root architecture. A. thaliana DR5::GUS plantlets, inoculated with IAA-producing endophytes, resulted in altered root growth and enhanced auxin response. Overall, the results indicate that the Glera PGP endospheric culturable microbiome could contribute, by structural root changes, to obtain water and nutrients increasing plant adaptation and survival. From the complete cultivable collection, twelve promising endophytes mainly belonging to the Bacillus but also to Micrococcus and Pantoea genera, were selected for further investigations in the grapevine host plants towards future application in sustainable management of vineyards."

https://openalex.org/W2207388150,"We develop a Bayesian analysis framework to detect heterogeneity in the diffusive behaviour of single particle trajectories on cells, implementing model selection to classify trajectories as either consistent with Brownian motion or with a two-state (diffusion coefficient) switching model. The incorporation of localisation accuracy is essential, as otherwise false detection of switching within a trajectory was observed and diffusion coefficient estimates were inflated. Since our analysis is on a single trajectory basis, we are able to examine heterogeneity between trajectories in a quantitative manner. Applying our method to the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) receptor tagged with latex beads (4 s trajectories at 1000 frames s−1), both intra- and inter-trajectory heterogeneity were detected; 12–26% of trajectories display clear switching between diffusive states dependent on condition, whilst the inter-trajectory variability is highly structured with the diffusion coefficients being related by D1 = 0.68D0 − 1.5 × 104 nm2 s−1, suggestive that on these time scales we are detecting switching due to a single process. Further, the inter-trajectory variability of the diffusion coefficient estimates (1.6 × 102 − 2.6 × 105 nm2 s−1) is very much larger than the measurement uncertainty within trajectories, suggesting that LFA-1 aggregation and cytoskeletal interactions are significantly affecting mobility, whilst the timescales of these processes are distinctly different giving rise to inter- and intra-trajectory variability. There is also an ‘immobile’ state (defined as D < 3.0 × 103 nm2 s−1) that is rarely involved in switching, immobility occurring with the highest frequency (47%) under T cell activation (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) treatment) with enhanced cytoskeletal attachment (calpain inhibition). Such ‘immobile’ states frequently display slow linear drift, potentially reflecting binding to a dynamic actin cortex. Our methods allow significantly more information to be extracted from individual trajectories (ultimately limited by time resolution and time-series length), and allow statistical comparisons between trajectories thereby quantifying inter-trajectory heterogeneity. Such methods will be highly informative for the construction and fitting of molecule mobility models within membranes incorporating aggregation, binding to the cytoskeleton, or traversing membrane microdomains."
https://openalex.org/W2296150002,"One of the most difficult aspects of conducting clinical research is the ability to successfully recruit participants. Pediatric clinical research presents unique recruitment challenges that relate to the need for parental consent on behalf of a minor, child assent, and school attendance. Yet, this has been less well studied. We conducted a survey of investigators performing human subjects research in a single large academic pediatric hospital to better understand characteristics of studies with successful recruitment.We conducted a web-based survey from September 2011 to December 2011 of all principal investigators with an Institutional Review Board approved human subjects protocol at Boston Children's Hospital, a pediatric Academic Medical Center. The survey captured various characteristics of the protocols including study design, staffing, resources, and investigator experience and training as well as respondents' perceived barriers and facilitators to recruitment. We used chi square tests and Mantel-Haenszel test for linear trend to examine the relationship between selected predictor variables and the binary outcome of successful vs. unsuccessful recruitment and multivariable logistic regression analyses to examine the simultaneous influence of potential predictors on each outcome.Among the 349 eligible investigators, 52% responded to the survey, and 181 with valid data were included in the analyses. Two-thirds of the 87 protocols closed to enrollment reached 80% or more of their target enrollment, whereas, only one-third of the 94 protocols actively recruiting were meeting 80% of their target. Recruitment method appeared to be the only significant and independent factor associated with achieving 80% or more of target enrollment in closed to enrollment protocols. Closed to enrollment protocols that used recruitment in person were 4.55 times (95% CI 1.30 to 15.93; p = 0.02) more likely to achieve 80% or more of their target enrollment when compared to those that used other recruitment methods. Other potentially modifiable factors such as number of study visits, study duration and investigator experience were suggestive of being meaningfully related to recruitment.Recruiting in person may promote reaching an acceptable target enrollment in pediatric as well as adult clinical research. Future research is needed on larger and more diverse samples to gain a better understanding of how the characteristics and qualifications of the individuals who conduct recruitment influence participant enrollment as well as how best to approach patient and families for their participation."
https://openalex.org/W2278557375,"Microglia have been proposed to play a pivotal role in the inflammation response of the CNS by expressing a range of proinflammatory enzymes and cytokines under pathological stimulus. Our previous study has confirmed that Nogo receptor (NgR), an axon outgrowth inhibition receptor, is also expressed on microglia and regulates cell adhesion and migration behavior in vitro. In the present study, we further investigated the proinflammatory effects and possible mechanisms of Nogo on microglia in vitro. In this study, Nogo peptide, Nogo-P4, a 25-amino acid core inhibitory peptide sequence of Nogo-66, was used. We found that Nogo-P4 was able to induce the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, NO, and prostaglandin E2 in microglia, which could be reversed by NEP1–40 (Nogo-66(1–40) antagonist peptide), phosphatidylinositol-specificphospholipase C, or NgR siRNA treatment. After Nogo-P4 stimulated microglia, the phosphorylation levels of NF-κB and STAT3 were increased obviously, which further mediated microglia expressing proinflammatory factors induced by Nogo-P4. Taken together, we concluded that Nogo peptide could directly take part in CNS inflammatory process by influencing the expression of proinflammatory factors in microglia, which were related to the NF-κB and STAT3 signal pathways. Besides neurite outgrowth restriction, the Nogo/NgR signal might be involved in multiple processes in various inflammation-associated CNS diseases. Microglia have been proposed to play a pivotal role in the inflammation response of the CNS by expressing a range of proinflammatory enzymes and cytokines under pathological stimulus. Our previous study has confirmed that Nogo receptor (NgR), an axon outgrowth inhibition receptor, is also expressed on microglia and regulates cell adhesion and migration behavior in vitro. In the present study, we further investigated the proinflammatory effects and possible mechanisms of Nogo on microglia in vitro. In this study, Nogo peptide, Nogo-P4, a 25-amino acid core inhibitory peptide sequence of Nogo-66, was used. We found that Nogo-P4 was able to induce the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, NO, and prostaglandin E2 in microglia, which could be reversed by NEP1–40 (Nogo-66(1–40) antagonist peptide), phosphatidylinositol-specificphospholipase C, or NgR siRNA treatment. After Nogo-P4 stimulated microglia, the phosphorylation levels of NF-κB and STAT3 were increased obviously, which further mediated microglia expressing proinflammatory factors induced by Nogo-P4. Taken together, we concluded that Nogo peptide could directly take part in CNS inflammatory process by influencing the expression of proinflammatory factors in microglia, which were related to the NF-κB and STAT3 signal pathways. Besides neurite outgrowth restriction, the Nogo/NgR signal might be involved in multiple processes in various inflammation-associated CNS diseases. Nogo-A, a myelin-associated inhibitory molecule, plays an important role in various cellular and molecular events contributing to the failure of CNS axon regrowth and reconnection after transection (1.He Z. Koprivica V. The Nogo signaling pathway for regeneration block.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 341-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).

Accumulating reports have demonstrated that interrupting the function of the Nogo-A/NgR signal on neurons enables the extension of axons over the insulted zone, which is beneficial for the regeneration of the neurite and the functional improvement of the injured CNS (3.McDonald C.L.

Evidence from animal models has elucidated that the efflux of macrophage out of the sites of inflammation in peripheral nerves and the termination of inflammation are mediated by NgR (4.Fry E.J. Ho C. David S. A role for Nogo receptor in macrophage clearance from injured peripheral nerve.Neuron. 2007; 53: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our previous work also demonstrated that NgR is expressed on microglia, and binding of NgR with Nogo-66 inhibits the adhesion and migration of microglia (5.Yan J. Zhou X. Guo J.J. Mao L. Wang Y.J. Sun J. Sun L.X. Zhang L.Y. Zhou X.F. Liao H. Nogo-66 inhibits adhesion and migration of microglia via GTPase Rho pathway in vitro.J. Neurochem. 2012; 120: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that NgR will possibly take part in neuroinflammation via mediating microglia adhesion and migration. So far, although several reports have implied the relationship between the Nogo-A signal and CNS inflammation, there is few direct evidence and mechanisms associated with the role of Nogo in neuroinflammation have been provided. In the present study, we explored the effects of Nogo-P4 on the expression of inflammatory mediators in microglia, including iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, TNF-α, NO, and PGE2. Nogo-P4 is a 25-amino acid inhibitory peptide sequence (residues 31–55 of Nogo-66), an active segment of Nogo-66, and has the core inhibitory activity of Nogo-66, a potent inhibitory component of Nogo-A (19.GrandPré T. Nakamura F. Vartanian T. Strittmatter S.M. Identification of the Nogo inhibitor of axon regeneration as a Reticulon protein.Nature. 2000; 403: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that both the NF-κB pathway and STAT3 pathway were responsible for the expression of inflammatory mediators triggered by Nogo-P4. Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Zhejiang Laboratory Animal Center (Hangzhou, China). All animal tests were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All experimental procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the Nanjing Medical University Experimental Animal Department. Primary microglia culture was prepared following the method described previously with some modifications (5.Yan J. Zhou X. Guo J.J. Mao L. Wang Y.J. Sun J. Sun L.X. Zhang L.Y. Zhou X.F. Liao H. Nogo-66 inhibits adhesion and migration of microglia via GTPase Rho pathway in vitro.J. Neurochem. 2012; 120: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortex from postnatal Sprague-Dawley rats (P0–P2) was stripped of meninges and chopped into small chunks. The tissue was then dissociated in trypsin-EDTA (0.25%; Sigma-Aldrich) before being seeded into poly-l-lysine (0.01 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich)-precoated T75 tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco). Subsequent medium change was carried out after 3 days. After 2 weeks in culture, floating and weakly attached cells on the mixed primary culture cell layer were isolated by gentle shaking of the flask. The resulting cell suspension was then collected by centrifugation. About 95% of these cells were positive for CD11b (cluster of differentiation molecule 11B), a marker for microglial cell types. BV-2 murine microglial cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), penicillin (0.1%; Sigma-Aldrich), streptomycin (0.1%; Sigma-Aldrich) at 5% CO2 at 37 °C. In this study, Nogo peptide, Nogo-P4 (Alpha Diagnostic International Inc.), a 25-amino acid core inhibitory peptide sequence of Nogo-66 (19.GrandPré T. Nakamura F. Vartanian T. Strittmatter S.M. Identification of the Nogo inhibitor of axon regeneration as a Reticulon protein.Nature. 2000; 403: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), was used for stimulating microglia, and Rtn-P4 (Alpha Diagnostic International), a Reticulon 1 (Rtn1) non-inhibitory control/blocking peptide, was used as a control. The method of treating microglia was as described previously with modifications (20.Oertle T. van der Haar M.E. Bandtlow C.E. Robeva A. Burfeind P. Buss A. Huber A.B. Simonen M. Schnell L. Brösamle C. Kaupmann K. Vallon R. Schwab M.E. Nogo-A inhibits neurite outgrowth and cell spreading with three discrete regions.J.

Nogo-A is a myelin-associated neurite outgrowth inhibitor and an antigen for monoclonal antibody IN-1.Nature. 2000; 403: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24-well plates were coated with methanol-solubilized nitrocellulose and air-dried under a sterile hood. Considering the possible anti-adhesion effects of Nogo-P4 on microglia, poly-l-lysine was used to aid in adhesion of microglia. Then Nogo-P4 or Rtn-P4 was applied at 100 μg/ml, and the protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Microglia freshly dissociated from primary culture or BV-2 microglial cells were added into the wells precoated with Nogo-P4 or Rtn-P4 and cultured for the indicated time. After the stimulation, cell lysis and supernatant were collected for further detection. To elucidate the signal pathway related to inflammation cytokine production induced by Nogo-P4, microglia were preincubated with the blocking agent NEP1–40 (Nogo-66(1–40) antagonist peptide) (10 μm; Sigma-Aldrich), PI-PLC (0.3 units/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), JSH-23, NF-κB activation inhibitor II (10 μm; Selleck Chemicals) or S3I-201, and STAT3 inhibitor VII (20 μm; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min before they were transferred into prepared wells. According to the gene sequence of rat NgR, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting NgR (NgR siRNA, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′ (antisense)) was designed. Meanwhile, nonspecific sequences (control siRNA, 5′-GCCGAAAUCUCACUAUCCUTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGGAUAGUGAGAUUUCGGCTT-3′ (antisense)) were used as a control. The siRNA was synthesized by Shanghai GenePharma Co. Ltd. Transfection of siRNAs was performed using Lipofectamine® 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). BV-2 microglial cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and cultured for 12 h. Before transfection, the medium was changed to a fresh one containing no serum. Treatment with control siRNA or NgR siRNA was realized at a final dose of 60 nm siRNA/well and removed 5 h post-transfection. These cells were subsequently cultured for 36 h. After transfection, BV-2 microglial cells were added into the wells precoated with Nogo-P4 or Rtn-P4 and cultured for the indicated time. After transfection, the cellular ability of BV-2 microglial cells was measured by MTT assay. After the indicated time, the medium was changed to a fresh one containing no serum, and MTT reagent (0.05 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cells for 4 h at 37 °C. Medium was carefully removed, and 200 μl of DMSO was added to each well to solubilize the precipitated formazan product. The absorbance was determined at 595 nm. The survival rate of treated samples was expressed as a percentage of absorbance at 595 nm of the PBS control. Microglia obtained from different treatments were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl), and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added just before use. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant protein (50 μg) was run in denaturing gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST and incubated with specific primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The following antibodies were used: goat anti-IL-1β (1:500; R&D Systems, AF-501-NA), rabbit anti-iNOS (1:800; Abcam, ab3523), goat anti-COX-2 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-1747), rabbit anti-NgR (1:1000; Merck Millipore, AB 15138), rabbit anti-phospho-NF-κB p65 at Ser-536 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., catalog no. 3033), rabbit anti-NF-κB p65 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., catalog no. 8242), rabbit anti-phospho-IKKβ (inhibitor of NF-κB kinase-β) at Ser-180 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., catalog no. 2697), rabbit anti-IKKβ (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., catalog no. 8943), rabbit anti-phospho-IκBα (inhibitor of NF-κB-α) at Ser-32 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., catalog no. 2859), mouse anti-IκBα (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., catalog no. 4814), rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3 at Tyr-705 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., catalog no. 9145), mouse anti-STAT3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., catalog no. 9139), or β-actin (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-47778). After incubating with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, anti-mouse IgG (1:3000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., catalog no. 7076), anti-goat IgG (1:500; R&D Systems, HAF019), or anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., catalog no. 7074), immunoreactive bands were then visualized by chemiluminescence reagents (ECL; Thermo Fisher Scientific). For blot densitometry assay, the images of protein bands were captured with a Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR documentation system. Semiquantitative densitometric analysis of the relative expressions of the protein were determined using Quantity One software by scanning the pixel density of the resultant blots. Concentrations of NO in the cell supernatants were determined by measuring nitrite, a major stable product of NO, using the Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide, 0.1% N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, 2.5% H3PO4) (Invitrogen). 100 μl of each culture medium collected from different groups were mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent. Absorbance was measured using a plate reader at 540 nm. The production of NO was calculated relative to that observed after control treatment. Supernatants of various treatment groups were collected to detect the release level of IL-1β, TNF-α, and PGE2 by a commercial ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined by a microplate reader. For identification of the effect of Nogo-P4 on nuclear translocation of NF-κB, microglia cultured on coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and then blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary polyclonal antibody to mouse anti-NF-κB (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8008) diluted in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum. Nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, H3570). After washing three times with PBS (pH 7.4), cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:300; Invitrogen, A11005) for 60 min at room temperature. The fluorescent imaging was visualized by using an Olympus fluorescence microscope (Japan). All present data represent the results of three or four independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey's test using GraphPad Prism version 5 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). All data are presented as mean ± S.D. p values of p < 0.05 (indicated with an asterisk) were considered statistically significant. To investigate the effects of Nogo-P4 on the production of proinflammatory enzymes and cytokines in microglia, wells were precoated with Nogo-P4 (100 μg/ml) or Rtn-P4 (100 μg/ml), and then primary cultured microglia were added into the wells and cultured for 6, 12, or 24 h. At the end of stimulation, the cell lysates and supernatants were collected, and the expression levels of proinflammatory enzymes and cytokines were determined. Results in Fig. 1 showed that Nogo-P4 stimulation significantly promoted microglia to express iNOS (12 and 24 h) and COX-2 (6 and 12 h) and also raised the release of IL-1β (12 h), TNF-α (6 and 12 h), PGE2 (12 h), and NO (12 h) in microglia. However, Rtn-P4 had no effects. Thus, a 12 h stimulation time was used for the following study. Moreover, full-length Nogo-66 increased the expression of IL-1β and NO in microglia (data not shown). These results implied that Nogo peptide could directly participate in inflammation associated with microglia by increasing the expression of proinflammatory enzymes and cytokines in microglia. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface NgR has been widely confirmed to be the Nogo-66 functional receptor to inhibit neurite growth (2.Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Identification of a receptor mediating Nogo-66 inhibition of axonal regeneration.Nature. 2001; 409: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) as well as neural cell migration (5.Yan J. Zhou X. Guo J.J. Mao L. Wang Y.J. Sun J. Sun L.X. Zhang L.Y. Zhou X.F. Liao H. Nogo-66 inhibits adhesion and migration of microglia via GTPase Rho pathway in vitro.J. Neurochem. 2012; 120: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22.Su Z. Cao L. Zhu Y. Liu X. Huang Z. Huang A. He C. Nogo enhances the adhesion of olfactory ensheathing cells and inhibits their migration.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1877-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To elucidate the possible signal pathway related to Nogo-P4, we assessed the mediation of NgR on Nogo-P4 facilitating proinflammatory cytokine production. The expression of NgR on primary cultured microglia has already been clearly identified in our previous study (5.Yan J. Zhou X. Guo J.J. Mao L. Wang Y.J. Sun J. Sun L.X. Zhang L.Y. Zhou X.F. Liao H. Nogo-66 inhibits adhesion and migration of microglia via GTPase Rho pathway in vitro.J. Neurochem. 2012; 120: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); thus, we pretreated microglia with NEP1–40 (10 μm) and the PI-PLC (0.3 units/ml) and then observed the effects of Nogo-P4 on expressing proinflammatory enzymes and cytokines. NEP1–40, a competitive antagonist peptide derived from the first 40 amino acids of the Nogo-66, promotes axonal outgrowth through blocking the binding of Nogo-66 to NgR in vitro and in vivo (23.GrandPré T. Li S. Strittmatter S.M. Nogo-66 receptor antagonist peptide promotes axonal regeneration.Nature. 2002; 417: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). PI-PLC is commonly used to release the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored NgR from the cell surface (2.Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Identification of a receptor mediating Nogo-66 inhibition of axonal regeneration.Nature. 2001; 409: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2, the results showed that NEP1–40 and PI-PLC treatment significantly attenuated the expression of pro-IL-1β, iNOS, and COX-2 as well as the release of IL-1β, NO, and PGE2 in microglia after Nogo-P4 stimulation, indicating that NgR was necessary for the effects of Nogo-P4 on the production of proinflammatory mediators in microglia. Furthermore, NgR was silenced by siRNA interference in BV-2 microglia, and the expression of proinflammatory mediators was analyzed. After transfection with NgR siRNA or control siRNA, the expression of NgR was determined by Western blot. Compared with control siRNA-treated cells, NgR siRNA-treated cells showed a significant decrease of the expression of NgR in BV-2 microglial cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Also, the transfection of control or NgR siRNA did not affect the cellular ability of BV-2 microglial cells (Fig. 3C). Results shown in Fig. 3, D–I, showed that NgR siRNA treatment significantly attenuated the expression of iNOS and COX-2 as well as the release of IL-1β, NO, and TNF-α in microglia after Nogo-P4 stimulation, indicating that NgR was responsible for the effects of Nogo-P4 on the expression of proinflammatory mediators in BV-2 microglial cells. The nuclear factor NF-κB pathway has long been considered as a prototypical proinflammatory signal pathway (24.Lawrence T. The nuclear factor NF-κB pathway in inflammation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1: a001651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2828) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the NF-κB pathway was responsible for the effects of Nogo-P4 on the production of proinflammatory mediators in microglia. Microglia were seeded into the wells precoated with Nogo-P4, and then cell lyses were collected for Western blot. We observed a significant increase in the phosphorylation levels of NF-κB, IKKβ, and IκBα in microglia after stimulation by Nogo-P4 for 6 h (Fig. 4, A–F). In addition, Immunofluorescent staining analysis showed that Nogo-P4 induced NF-κB nuclear translocation in microglia (Fig. 4, G and H). Furthermore, we determined whether NgR mediated NF-κB pathway activation induced by Nogo-P4. Before they were added to the protein-coated plate, microglia were pretreated with NEP1–40 (10 μm) for 30 min to interrupt the function of NgR. Results shown in Fig. 5, A–F, showed that NEP1–40 treatment significantly attenuated phosphorylation levels of NF-κB, IKKβ, and IκBα in microglia increased by Nogo-P4. Also, NF-κB nuclear translocation in microglia was significantly inhibited by NEP1–40. (Fig. 5, G and H). The results above indicated that Nogo-P4 bound to the NgR receptor and further triggered the activation of the NF-κB pathway. To validate whether the activation of NF-κB pathway was a response to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by Nogo-P4, JSH-23 (an NF-κB activation inhibitor), which could inhibit nuclear translocation of NF-κB (25.Ren S. Zhang S. Li M. Huang C. Liang R. Jiang A. Guo Y. Pu Y. Huang N. Yang J. Li Z. NF-κB p65 and c-Rel subunits promote phagocytosis and cytokine secretion by splenic macrophages in cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2013; 45: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was used to block the activity of the NF-κB signal pathway. We found that the nuclear translocation of NF-κB increased by Nogo-P4 was blocked in microglia pretreated with JSH-23 (10 μm) for 30 min (Fig. 6, A and B). Results presented in Fig. 6, C–I, indicated that promotion of Nogo-P4 upon microglial expression of iNOS and COX-2 as well as the release of IL-1β, TNF-α, NO, and PGE2 was attenuated by JSH-23 (10 μm) pretreatment, suggesting that the NF-κB pathway was responsible for the effects of the Nogo/NgR signal on microglia expressing proinflammatory mediators. The STAT3 signal pathway has been shown to play roles in the inflammatory signaling cascades in response to several immune stimulations. Thus, we next investigated whether STAT3 signal pathway acted as the intracellular signal transducer to mediate the release of proinflammatory cytokines in microglia after Nogo-P4 stimulation. Microglia were seeded into the wells precoated with Nogo-P4, and then cells were collected for STAT3 activity detection. It was observed that Nogo-P4 significantly increased the STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylated at residue Tyr-705 (Fig. 7, A and B). Furthermore, the activation of the STAT3 pathway was greatly attenuated after the function block of NgR with NEP1–40 or PI-PLC (Fig. 7, C and D). The results above implied that Nogo-P4 bound to the NgR receptor and further triggered the phosphorylation of STAT3. To validate whether the activation of STAT3 pathway was a response to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by Nogo-P4, S3I-201, an inhibitor of STAT3 (26.Siddiquee K. Zhang S.

S3I-201 (20 μm) lowered the phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by Nogo-P4 (Fig. 7, E and F).

The current study intended to explore the protective role of edible (aqueous) extract of I. aquatica (AEIA) against experimentally induced Pb-intoxication.The cytoprotective role of AEIA was measured on mouse hepatocytes by cell viability assay followed by Hoechst staining and flow cytometric assay. The effect on ROS production, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, intracellular redox status were measured after incubating the hepatocytes with Pb-acetate (6.8 μM) along with AEIA (400 μg/ml). The effects on the expressions of apoptotic signal proteins were estimated by western blotting. The protective role of AEIA was measured by in vivo assay in mice. Haematological, serum biochemical, tissue redox status, Pb bioaccumulation and histological parameters were evaluated to estimate the protective role of AEIA (100 mg/kg) against Pb-acetate (5 mg/kg) intoxication.Pb-acetate treated hepatocytes showed a gradual reduction of cell viability dose-dependently with an IC50 value of 6.8 μM. Pb-acetate treated hepatocytes exhibited significantly enhanced levels (p < 0.01) of ROS production, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation with concomitant depletion (p < 0.01) of antioxidant enzymes and GSH. However, AEIA treatment could significantly restore the aforementioned parameters in murine hepatocytes near to normalcy. Besides, AEIA significantly reversed (p < 0.05-0.01) the alterations of transcription levels of apoptotic proteins viz. Bcl 2, Bad, Cyt C, Apaf-1, cleaved caspases [caspase 3, caspase 8 and caspase 9], Fas and Bid. In in vivo bioassay, Pb-acetate treatment caused significantly high intracellular Pb burden and oxidative pressure in the kidney, liver, heart, brain and testes in mice. In addition, the haematological and serum biochemical factors were changed significantly in Pb-acetate-treated animals. AEIA treatment restored significantly the evaluated-parameters to the near-normal position.The extract may offer the protective effect via counteracting with Pb mediated oxidative stress and/or promoting the elimination of Pb by chelating. The presence of substantial quantities of flavonoids, phenolics and saponins would be responsible for the overall protective effect."

The interaction between GluA2 and PICK1 is required for the removal of GluA2 from the synaptic plasma membrane during long-term depression (LTD). It has been suggested that glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) is activated during LTD, but the relationships between GluA2, PICK1, and GSK-3β are not well understood. In particular, the substrate(s) of GSK-3β have not yet been determined. Here we showed that PICK1 is a substrate of GSK-3β. We found that Ser339, Ser342, Ser412, and Ser416 of PICK1 were putative GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation sites. Among these sites, Ser416 played a crucial role in regulating the interaction between GluA2 and PICK1. We showed that replacing Ser416 with Ala disrupted the GluA2-PICK1 interaction, whereas substituting Ser416 with Glu or Asp retained this interaction. However, deletion of Ser416 did not affect the GluA2-PICK1 interaction, and substitution of Ser416 with Ala did not alter the PICK1-PICK1 interaction. Using image analysis in COS-7 cells with AcGFP1-fused PICK1, we showed that substitution of Ser416 with Ala increased the formation of AcGFP1-positive clusters, suggesting an increase in the association of PICK1 with the membrane. This may have resulted in the dissociation of the GluA2-PICK1 complexes. Our results indicated that GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of PICK1 at Ser416 was required for its association with the AMPA receptor subunit.

The most recent contribution from the EFI was the demonstration of the utility of solute-binding proteins (SBPs) for tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporters to guide functional discovery (12.Vetting M.W. Al-Obaidi N. Zhao S. San Francisco B. Kim J. Wichelecki D.J. Bouvier J.T. Solbiati J.O. Vu H. Zhang X. Rodionov D.A. Love J.D. Hillerich B.S. Seidel R.D. Quinn R.J. et al.Experimental strategies for functional annotation and metabolism discovery: targeted screening of solute-binding proteins and unbiased panning of metabolomes.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 909-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The premise was that the small molecule ligands of SBPs represent the chemical “starting points” of metabolic pathways (i.e. the substrate for the first enzyme in a metabolic pathway). This information imposes significant constraints on the regions of chemical space and types of enzymatic transformations that must be considered for pathway deconvolution. In combination with annotated functions for the proteins encoded by the genes proximal to that encoding the SBP, these insights allow the facilitated prediction of new metabolic pathways and the discovery of novel enzymatic functions. In this study, we apply this strategy to an alternative class of transporters, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Most ABC transporters are composed of three components as follows: a transmembrane domain, a nucleotide binding domain, and an SBP (13.Jones P.M. George A.M. The ABC transporter structure and mechanism: perspectives on recent research.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 14.Davidson A.L. Dassa E. Orelle C. Chen J. Structure, function, and evolution of bacterial ATP-binding cassette systems.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of ATP provides the energy needed to transport the solute across the cell membrane (15.Rees D.C. Johnson E. Lewinson O. ABC transporters: the power to change.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). ABC transporters are widely spread throughout all phyla of life. Applying the SBP-based strategy for pathway discovery to the ABC transporters enabled the discovery of a novel polyol metabolic pathway for catabolism of d-altritol (also known as d-talitol). For this pathway, the SBP-proximal genome neighborhood was found to contain three genes encoding enzymes that convert d-altritol to the central metabolite fructose 6-phosphate. Two enzymes perform novel reactions, and the third enzyme is responsible for a previously orphan Enzyme Commission (EC) number. Notably, one of these is a member of a family of ∼6,000 previously unannotated proteins. Together, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy for facilitating functional discovery and correcting errors in the protein databases. Rare sugars, such as d-altritol, have attracted attention because of their importance to the food, pharmaceutical, artificial sweetener, and nutrition industries (16.Zijie L. Yahui G. Hideki N.

Garcia-Junceda E. Wong C. A short enzymic synthesis of l-glucose from dihydroxyacetone phosphate and l-glyceraldehyde.Beilstein J. Org. Chem. 1995; 9: 2434-2445Google Scholar). From a biomedical perspective, rare sugars and their nucleoside derivatives are candidates for anticancer and antiviral drugs (18.Beerens K. Desmet T. Soetaert W. Enzymes for the biocatalytic production of rare sugars.J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2012; 39: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Specifically, siRNA made from d-altritol-modified nucleic acids has been used to inhibit hepatitis B virus replication (19.Hean J. Crowther C. Ely A. Ul Islam R. Barichievy S. Bloom K.

Herdewijn P. Inhibition of MDR1 expression with altritol-modified siRNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Defining metabolic pathways involving d-altritol may enable the development of new low cost synthetic routes, which will further its impact in medicine and industry. d-Altritol has been isolated from brown algae of the order Fucales (21.Raven J.A. Beardall J. Chudek J.A. Scrimgeour C.M. Clayton M.N. McInroy S.G. Altritol synthesis by Notheia anomala.Phytochemistry. 2001; 58: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although d-altritol is not known to be a widespread plant metabolite, polyols are primary photosynthetic products; therefore, the existence of d-altritol may be phylogenetically widespread, albeit at low abundance (22.Fox T.C.

In this study, d-altritol catabolism was predicted and verified in the tumor-producing plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58. Tumor production proceeds through insertion into the plant genome of a small segment of DNA from Agrobacterium's Ti plasmid (27.Chilton M.D. Drummond M.H. Merio D.J. Sciaky D. Montoya A.L.

Sequence similarity networks (SSNs) for Pfam families PF01547 (bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein), PF01116 (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase), PF00294 (PfkB family carbohydrate kinase), and PF08013 (tagatose-6-phosphate kinase) were generated with Option B of the EFI-Enzyme Similarity Tool (EFI-EST), which uses one or more Pfam families as input (11.Gerlt J.A.

The SSNs of PF00106 (short-chain dehydrogenase) and PF00107 (zinc-binding dehydrogenase) could not be generated via Option B because of the large number of sequences in these Pfam families; these SSNs were generated via Option A of EFI-EST, which uses a protein sequence as input and generates an SSN from the top 5,000 BLAST hits identified by the query sequence. All SSNs were visualized as 100% representative node networks generated with a minimum edge alignment score threshold corresponding to ∼35% sequence identity selected from the percent identity-alignment score quartile plot provided by EFI-EST. The alignment score thresholds for edge inclusion were then made increasingly stringent using Cytoscape to generate the networks used in pathway prediction. The genome neighborhood networks (GNNs) for PF01547 (bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein) and PF00294 (PfkB family carbohydrate kinase) were generated using the EFI-Genome Neighborhood Tool (EFI-GNT). The input was the xgmml file for the SSN cluster containing the d-altritol binding ABC SBPs (AltSBPs). The output was generated using the default parameters (neighborhood size = 10, co-occurrence lower limit = 20%). The genes encoding ABC SBPs were amplified from genomic DNAs by PCR using KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen) and the primers listed in Table 1. The conditions were as follows: 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 66 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C.

In a 10-μl volume (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT), the ligand concentration was 1 mm; the protein concentration was 10 μm, and Sypro-Orange was at 5× (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The ligand library consists of 405 ligands and eight controls (protein without compound) in 192 duplicated wells (384 wells total) (supplemental Table S1). DSF data were measured using an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR system with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 530 nm. The samples were heated from 22 to 99 °C at a rate of 3 °C min−1; the resulting curves were fit to a Boltzmann equation to determine the midpoint temperature of the melting transition (Tm). These values were compared with control wells to calculate the ΔTm. A ΔTm of greater than 5 °C is considered to indicate a significant interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2291711496,"An initial step in amyloid-β (Aβ) production includes amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage via β-Site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Increased levels of brain Aβ have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, β-secretase represents a primary target for inhibitor drug development in AD. In this study, aptamers were obtained from combinatorial oligonucleotide libraries using a technology referred to as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). A purified human BACE1 extracellular domain was used as a target to conduct an in vitro selection process using SELEX. Two DNA aptamers were capable of binding to BACE1 with high affinity and good specificity, with Kd values in the nanomolar range. We subsequently confirmed that one aptamer, A1, exhibited a distinct inhibitory effect on BACE1 activity in an AD cell model. We detected the effects of M17-APPsw cells that stably expressed Swedish mutant APP after aptamer A1 treatment. Aβ40 and Aβ42 concentrations secreted by M17-APPsw cells decreased intracellularly and in culture media. Furthermore, Western blot analysis indicated that sAPPβ expression significantly decreased in the A1 treated versus control groups. These findings support the preliminary feasibility of an aptamer evolved from a SELEX strategy to function as a potential BACE1 inhibitor. To our knowledge, this is the first study to acquire a DNA aptamer that exhibited binding specificity to BACE1 and inhibited its activity."
https://openalex.org/W2342169253,"Nutrition affects milk composition thus influencing its nutritional properties. Nutrition also modifies the expression of mammary genes, whose regulation is not fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non coding RNA which are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression by targeting messenger RNAs. Our goal was to characterize miRNA whose expression is regulated by nutrition in the lactating goat mammary gland, which may provide clues to deciphering regulations of the biosynthesis and secretion of milk components.Using high-throughput sequencing technology, miRNomes of the lactating mammary gland were established from lactating goats fed ad libitum or deprived of food for 48 h affecting milk production and composition. High throughput miRNA sequencing revealed 30 miRNA with an expression potentially modulated by food deprivation; 16 were down-regulated and 14 were up-regulated. Diana-microT predictive tools suggested a potential role for several nutriregulated miRNA in lipid metabolism. Among the putative targets, 19 were previously identified as differently expressed genes (DEG). The functions of these 19 DEG revealed, notably, their involvement in tissue remodelling.In conclusion, this study offers the first evidence of nutriregulated miRNA in the ruminant mammary gland. Characterization of these 30 miRNA could contribute to a clearer understanding of gene regulation in the mammary gland in response to nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2234778104,"Objective Elevated levels of serum leptin are associated with increased adiposity and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Both cytokines and body adiposity have been shown to predict cardiovascular events and mortality. The primary objective of the present study is to explore the associations between serum leptin and all-cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) over a span of 10 years, controlling for body adiposity and proinflammatory cytokines. Methods The Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) study is a prospective cohort of 3,075 older adults aged 70 to 79 years. This analysis includes 2,919 men and women with complete serum leptin and vital status data. Data on all-cause mortality and incident cardiovascular events (including Coronary Heart Disease and Congestive Heart Failure) were collected over 10 years of follow-up (mean 8.4 years). Results Women with leptin in quartile 2 and 3 were at lower risk of all-cause mortality, and those with leptin in quartile 2 were at lower risk of mortality from CVD as compared to women with lowest leptin values when adjusted for age, race, site, years of education, alcohol use, smoking, and physical activity. When these associations were additionally adjusted for body fat, C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines, women with leptin values in quartile 3 were at lower risk of all-cause mortality and women with leptin in quartile 2 and 3 were at lower risk of mortality from CVD than women with lowest leptin values. These associations were not significant among men after adjusting for body fat and cytokines. Conclusions The present study suggests that moderately elevated concentrations of serum leptin are independently associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality and CVD-related mortality among older women. Among men, serum leptin is not associated with reduced risk of all-cause and CVD mortality after controlling for body fat and cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1837104643,"Consistency of between-individual differences in behaviour or personality is a phenomenon in populations that can have ecological consequences and evolutionary potential. One way that behaviour can evolve is to have a genetic basis. Identifying the molecular genetic basis of personality could therefore provide insight into how and why such variation is maintained, particularly in natural populations. Previously identified candidate genes for personality in birds include the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4), and serotonin transporter (SERT). Studies of wild bird populations have shown that exploratory and bold behaviours are associated with polymorphisms in both DRD4 and SERT. Here we tested for polymorphisms in DRD4 and SERT in the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) population on Cousin Island, Seychelles, and then investigated correlations between personality and polymorphisms in these genes. We found no genetic variation in DRD4, but identified four polymorphisms in SERT that clustered into five haplotypes. There was no correlation between bold or exploratory behaviours and SERT polymorphisms/haplotypes. The null result was not due to lack of power, and indicates that there was no association between these behaviours and variation in the candidate genes tested in this population. These null findings provide important data to facilitate representative future meta-analyses on candidate personality genes."
https://openalex.org/W2209724780,"Impaired wound healing represents a high cost for health care systems. Endothelial dysfunction characterizes dermal microangiopathy and contributes to delayed wound healing and chronic ulcers. Endothelial dysfunction impairs cutaneous microvascular blood flow by inducing an imbalance between vasorelaxation and vasoconstriction as a consequence of reduced nitric oxide (NO) production and the increase of oxidative stress and inflammation. Propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC) is a natural derivative of carnitine that has been reported to ameliorate post-ischemic blood flow recovery.We investigated the effects of PLC in rat skin flap and cutaneous wound healing. A daily oral PLC treatment improved skin flap viability and associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduction, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NO up-regulation, accelerated wound healing and increased capillary density, likely favoring dermal angiogenesis by up-regulation for iNOS, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor (PlGF) and reduction of NADPH-oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression. In serum-deprived human dermal microvascular endothelial cell cultures, PLC ameliorated endothelial dysfunction by increasing iNOS, PlGF, VEGF receptors 1 and 2 expression and NO level. In addition, PLC counteracted serum deprivation-induced impairment of mitochondrial β-oxidation, Nox4 and cellular adhesion molecule (CAM) expression, ROS generation and leukocyte adhesion. Moreover, dermal microvascular endothelial cell dysfunction was prevented by Nox4 inhibition. Interestingly, inhibition of β-oxidation counteracted the beneficial effects of PLC on oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction.PLC treatment improved rat skin flap viability, accelerated wound healing and dermal angiogenesis. The beneficial effects of PLC likely derived from improvement of mitochondrial β-oxidation and reduction of Nox4-mediated oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Antioxidant therapy and pharmacological targeting of endothelial dysfunction may represent a promising tool for the treatment of delayed wound healing or chronic ulcers."
https://openalex.org/W2233980060,"Skin represents the largest organ of the human body and plays a crucial role in its protection from the negative impact of the outside environment, maintains its homeostasis, enables sensory interaction and thermoregulation. The traumatized skin tissue undergoes several phenotype switches due to progressive reoxygenation and release of cytokine and growth factors, that activate mechanisms of reparative processes. However, in case of wounds colonized with pathogenic microflora natural regenerative mechanisms become substantially impaired, that could lead to chronic inflammatory states with non-healing skin lesions. Herein, we present the initial results of our studies aimed at the design of bifunctional peptide-based compounds. The chemical approach, that was utilized in this work, was based on the conjugation of antimicrobial peptides with the peptides, that have potential pro-proliferative and/or cytoprotective activity towards human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, in order to obtain antimicrobials with reduced cytotoxicity or compounds that maintain both activities, i.e. inhibit bacterial or fungi growth and activate cell proliferation/migration in in vitro tests. As a result, we obtained a group of peptide conjugates that effectively inhibited the growth of selected bacterial and fungi strains and were able to stimulate proliferation and migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts under their effective microbicidal concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2212337979,"Background Pharmaceutical promotion activities in low and middle-income countries are often neither regulated nor monitored. While Egypt has the highest population and per capita use of medicines in the Arab world, we know very little about pharmaceutical companies promotional activities in the country. Aim To explore and analyze the perceptions of physicians towards promotional and marketing activities of pharmaceutical companies among physicians and pharmacists in Egypt. Methodology Perspectives of different healthcare system stakeholders were explored through semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted in 2014 in Cairo, Egypt. Interviewees were chosen via purposive sampling and snowball technique. Each interview was recorded and transcribed. Then qualitative, thematic analysis was conducted with the help of NVIVO software. Findings The majority of physicians and pharmacists acknowledged exposure to pharmaceutical promotion. It was commonly believed that interaction with the pharmaceutical industry is necessary and both associated risks and benefits were acknowledged. The interviewed physicians considered themselves competent enough to minimize risks and maximize benefits to their prescribing habits. Views diverged on the extent and magnitude of the risks and benefits of pharmaceutical promotion, especially in regard to the influence on patients’ health. Conclusions Pharmaceutical promotion in Egypt is intensely directed at prescribers and dispensers. Physicians, pharmacists and policymakers expressed little skepticism to the influence of promotion towards their individual prescribing. Raising awareness of the pitfalls of pharmaceutical promotion is necessary, especially among the less experienced physicians."
https://openalex.org/W2219924698,"The Atypical ChemoKine Receptor 1 (ACKR1) gene, better known as Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC or Duffy), is responsible for the Duffy Blood Group and plays a major role in regulating the circulating homeostatic levels of pro-inflammatory chemokines. Previous studies have shown that one common variant, the Duffy Null (Fy-) allele that is specific to African Ancestry groups, completely removes expression of the gene on erythrocytes; however, these individuals retain endothelial expression. Additional alleles are associated with a myriad of clinical outcomes related to immune responses and inflammation. In addition to allele variants, there are two distinct transcript isoforms of DARC which are expressed from separate promoters, and very little is known about the distinct transcriptional regulation or the distinct functionality of these protein isoforms. Our objective was to determine if the African specific Fy- allele alters the expression pattern of DARC isoforms and therefore could potentially result in a unique signature of the gene products, commonly referred to as antigens. Our work is the first to establish that there is expression of DARC on lymphoblasts. Our data indicates that people of African ancestry have distinct relative levels of DARC isoforms expressed in these cells. We conclude that the expression of both isoforms in combination with alternate alleles yields multiple Duffy antigens in ancestry groups, depending upon the haplotypes across the gene. Importantly, we hypothesize that DARC isoform expression patterns will translate into ancestry-specific inflammatory responses that are correlated with the axis of pro-inflammatory chemokine levels and distinct isoform-specific interactions with these chemokines. Ultimately, this work will increase knowledge of biological mechanisms underlying disparate clinical outcomes of inflammatory-related diseases among ethnic and geographic ancestry groups."
https://openalex.org/W2189217234,"We performed a systematic analysis of gene expression features in early (10-21 days) development of human vs mouse embryonic cells (hESCs vs mESCs). Many development features were found to be conserved, and a majority of differentially regulated genes have similar expression change in both organisms. The similarity is especially evident, when gene expression profiles are clustered together and properties of clustered groups of genes are compared. First 10 days of mESC development match the features of hESC development within 21 days, in accordance with the differences in population doubling time in human and mouse ESCs. At the same time, several important differences are seen. There is a clear difference in initial expression change of transcription factors and stimulus responsive genes, which may be caused by the difference in experimental procedures. However, we also found that some biological processes develop differently; this can clearly be shown, for example, for neuron and sensory organ development. Some groups of genes show peaks of the expression levels during the development and these peaks cannot be claimed to happen at the same time points in the two organisms, as well as for the same groups of (orthologous) genes. We also detected a larger number of upregulated genes during development of mESCs as compared to hESCs. The differences were quantified by comparing promoters of related genes. Most of gene groups behave similarly and have similar transcription factor (TF) binding sites on their promoters. A few groups of genes have similar promoters, but are expressed differently in two species. Interestingly, there are groups of genes expressed similarly, although they have different promoters, which can be shown by comparing their TF binding sites. Namely, a large group of similarly expressed cell cycle-related genes is found to have discrepant TF binding properties in mouse vs human."
https://openalex.org/W2200515395,"The diet-tissue discrimination factor is the amount by which a consumer’s tissue varies isotopically from its diet, and is therefore a key element in models that use stable isotopes to estimate diet composition. In this study we measured discrimination factors in blood (whole blood, red blood cells and plasma), liver, muscle and feathers of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) for stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. Cormorants exhibited discrimination factors that differed significantly among tissue types (for carbon and nitrogen), and differed substantially (in the context of the isotopic variation among relevant prey species) from those observed in congeneric species. The Double-crested Cormorant has undergone rapid population expansion throughout much of its historic range over the past three decades, leading to both real and perceived conflicts with fisheries throughout North America, and this study provides an essential link for the use of stable isotope analysis in researching foraging ecology, diet, and resource use of this widespread and controversial species."
https://openalex.org/W1919042480,"The molecular mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis have been widely investigated by differential gene expression approach, especially RT-qPCR methodology. However, controversial findings highlight the occurrence of unpredictable sources of variance in the experimental designs. Here, we investigated if diurnal rhythms of transcript's levels may impact on differential gene expression analysis in hippocampus of rats with experimental epilepsy. For this, we have selected six core clock genes (Per1, Per3, Bmal1, Clock, Cry1 and Cry2), whose rhythmic expression pattern in hippocampus had been previously reported. Initially, we identified Tubb2a/Rplp1 and Tubb2a/Ppia as suitable normalizers for circadian studies in hippocampus of rats maintained to 12:12 hour light:dark (LD) cycle. Next, we confirmed the temporal profiling of Per1, Per3, Bmal1, Cry1 and Cry2 mRNA levels in the hippocampus of naive rats by both Acrophase and CircWave statistical tests for circadian analysis. Finally, we showed that temporal differences of sampling can change experimental results for Per1, Per3, Bmal1, Cry1 and Cry2, but not for Clock, which was consistently decreased in rats with epilepsy in all comparison to the naive group. In conclusion, our study demonstrates it is mandatory to consider diurnal oscillations, in order to avoid erroneous conclusions in gene expression analysis in hippocampus of rats with epilepsy. Investigators, therefore, should be aware that genes with circadian expression could be out of phase in different animals of experimental and control groups. Moreover, our results indicate that a sub-expression of Clock may be involved in epileptogenicity, although the functional significance of this remains to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2211508892,"Ten microsatellite loci were characterized for 34 locations from roundtail chub (Gila robusta complex) to better resolve patterns of genetic variation among local populations in the lower Colorado River basin. This group has had a complex taxonomic history and previous molecular analyses failed to identify species diagnostic molecular markers. Our results supported previous molecular studies based on allozymes and DNA sequences, which found that most genetic variance was explained by differences among local populations. Samples from most localities were so divergent species-level diagnostic markers were not found. Some geographic samples were discordant with current taxonomy due to admixture or misidentification; therefore, additional morphological studies are necessary. Differences in spatial genetic structure were consistent with differences in connectivity of stream habitats, with the typically mainstem species, G. robusta, exhibiting greater genetic connectedness within the Gila River drainage. No species exhibited strong isolation by distance over the entire stream network, but the two species typically found in headwaters, G. nigra and G. intermedia, exhibited greater than expected genetic similarity between geographically proximate populations, and usually clustered with individuals from the same geographic location and/or sub-basin. These results highlight the significance of microevolutionary processes and importance of maintaining local populations to maximize evolutionary potential for this complex. Augmentation stocking as a conservation management strategy should only occur under extreme circumstances, and potential source populations should be geographically proximate stocks of the same species, especially for the headwater forms."
https://openalex.org/W2260698573,"In this paper, we apply a real time activity-dependent protocol to study how freely swimming weakly electric fish produce and process the timing of their own electric signals. Specifically, we address this study in the elephant fish, Gnathonemus petersii, an animal that uses weak discharges to locate obstacles or food while navigating, as well as for electro-communication with conspecifics. To investigate how the inter pulse intervals vary in response to external stimuli, we compare the response to a simple closed-loop stimulation protocol and the signals generated without electrical stimulation. The activity-dependent stimulation protocol explores different stimulus delivery delays relative to the fish's own electric discharges. We show that there is a critical time delay in this closed-loop interaction, as the largest changes in inter pulse intervals occur when the stimulation delay is below 100 ms. We also discuss the implications of these findings in the context of information processing in weakly electric fish."

Although many studies have focused on sexual function in women with cervical cancer, little is known about the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction and its risk factors in women with non-malignant cervical diseases. The present study aims to assess sexual function in Chinese women with non-malignant cervical diseases and to identify potential risk factors for these diseases. A cross-sectional hospital-based survey was conducted in Nanjing, China. The Chinese version of the Female Sexual Function Index (CVFSFI) was used to evaluate sexual function. Three hundred three women who had been diagnosed with at least one non-malignant cervical disease and 293 healthy women were recruited from Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. We found that women with non-malignant cervical diseases had a significantly higher prevalence of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) (51.8% vs. 34.8%), low desire (43.2% vs. 26.3%), arousal disorder (41.6% vs. 28.3%), and lubrication disorder (51.2% vs. 36.9%) compared with the control group. Cervicitis and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were found to be independent risk factors for FSD. Our study indicates that women with cervicitis and CIN are at a high risk for FSD and deserve focused initial and follow-up management."

After allogeneic stem cell transplantation, regulatory T cells are known to mitigate graft versus host disease while probably maintaining a graft versus leukemia effect. Short alleles (≤(GT)15) for the (GT)n polymorphism in the promoter/enhancer of FOXP3 are associated with a higher expression of FOXP3, and hypothetically with an increase of regulatory T cell activity. This polymorphism has been related to the development of auto- or alloimmune conditions including type 1 diabetes or graft rejection in renal transplant recipients. However, its impact in the allo-transplant setting has not been analyzed. In the present study, which includes 252 myeloablative HLA-identical allo-transplants, multivariate analysis revealed a lower incidence of grade III-IV acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) in patients transplanted from donors harboring short alleles (OR = 0.26, CI 0.08-0.82, p = 0.021); without affecting chronic GVHD or graft versus leukemia effect, since cumulative incidence of relapse, event free survival and overall survival rates are similar in both groups of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2336832606,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been associated with wheezing and asthma in children and the genetic variation of the IL-10 cytokine production may be linked to post-bronchiolitis lung function. We used impulse oscillometry (IOS) to evaluate the associations of IL10 polymorphisms with lung function at a median age of 6.3 years in children hospitalised for bronchiolitis before six months of age.We performed baseline and post-exercise IOS on 103 former bronchiolitis patients. Data on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of IL10 rs1800896 (-1082G/A), rs1800871 (-819C/T), rs1800872 (-592C/A) were available for 99 children and of IL10 rs1800890 (-3575T/A) for 98 children.IL10 rs1800896, rs1800871 and rs1800872 combined genotype AA+CT+CA and carriage of haplotype ATA, respectively, were associated with higher resistance and lower reactance in baseline IOS in adjusted analyses. At IL10 rs1800890, the A/A-genotype and carriers of A-allele were associated with lower reactance in baseline IOS. There were no significant associations between the studied SNPs and airway hyper-reactivity to exercise.Low-IL-10-producing polymorphisms in the IL-10 encoding gene were associated with obstructive lung function parameters, suggesting an important role for IL-10 in development of lung function deficit in early bronchiolitis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2342265050,"The efficacy of chloroquine, once the drug of choice in the fight against Plasmodium falciparum, is now severely limited due to widespread resistance. Amodiaquine is one of the most potent antimalarial 4-aminoquinolines known and remains effective against chloroquine-resistant parasites, but toxicity issues linked to a quinone-imine metabolite limit its clinical use. In search of new compounds able to retain the antimalarial activity of amodiaquine while circumventing quinone-imine metabolite toxicity, we have synthesized five 4-aminoquinolines that feature rings lacking hydroxyl groups in the side chain of the molecules and are thus incapable of generating toxic quinone-imines. The new compounds displayed high in vitro potency (low nanomolar IC50), markedly superior to chloroquine and comparable to amodiaquine, against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum, accompanied by low toxicity to L6 rat fibroblasts and MRC5 human lung cells, and metabolic stability comparable or higher than that of amodiaquine. Computational studies indicate a unique mode of binding of compound 4 to heme through the HOMO located on a biphenyl moeity, which may partly explain the high antiplasmodial activity observed for this compound."
https://openalex.org/W1852066922,"Earlier studies have shown that genetic variability in the SLC6A4 gene encoding the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) may be important for the re-uptake of serotonin (5-HT) in the central nervous system. In the present study we investigated how the 5-HTT genotype i.e. the short (S) versus long (L) 5-HTTLPR allele and the SNP rs25531 A > G affect the physical and psychosocial functioning in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). All 120 patients were recruited from The Department of Paediatrics at Oslo University Hospital, Norway, a national referral center for young CFS patients (12-18 years). Main outcomes were number of steps per day obtained by an accelerometer and disability scored by the Functional Disability Inventory (FDI). Patients with the 5-HTT SS or SLG genotype had a significantly lower number of steps per day than patients with the 5-HTT LALG, SLA or LALA genotype. Patients with the 5-HTT SS or SLG genotype also had a significantly higher FDI score than patients with the 5-HTT LALG, SLA or LALA genotype. Thus, CFS patients with the 5-HTT SS or SLG genotype had worse 30 weeks outcome than CFS patients with the 5-HTT LALG, SLA or LALA genotype. The present study suggests that the 5-HTT genotype may be a factor that contributes to maintenance of CFS."
https://openalex.org/W2194880053,"Reservoirs around the world contribute to cycling of carbon dioxide (CO2) with the atmosphere, but there is little information on how ecosystem processes determine the absorption or emission of CO2. Reservoirs are the most prevalent freshwater systems in the arid southwest of North America, yet it is unclear whether they sequester or release CO2 and therefore how water impoundment impacts global carbon cycling. We sampled three reservoirs in San Diego, California, weekly for one year. We measured seasonal variation in the abundances of bacteria, phytoplankton, and zooplankton, as well as water chemistry (pH, nutrients, ions, dissolved organic carbon [DOC]), which were used to estimate partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), and CO2 flux. We found that San Diego reservoirs are most often undersaturated with CO2 with respect to the atmosphere and are estimated to absorb on average 3.22 mmol C m-2 day-1. pCO2 was highest in the winter and lower in the summer, indicating seasonal shifts in the magnitudes of photosynthesis and respiration associated with day length, temperature and water inputs. Abundances of microbes (bacteria) peaked in the winter along with pCO2, while phytoplankton, nutrients, zooplankton and DOC were all unrelated to pCO2. Our data indicate that reservoirs of semi-arid environments may primarily function as carbon sinks, and that carbon flux varies seasonally but is unrelated to nutrient or DOC availability, or the abundances of phytoplankton or zooplankton."
https://openalex.org/W2216921496,"Background and Aims Although many studies have indicated a relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hyperuricemia, a few studies specifically examining the effects of the severity of liver fat content (LFC) on serum uric acid (SUA) and the presence of hyperuricemia because of the limitation of the examination methods for NAFLD. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the NAFLD and SUA levels in the Chinese population using standardized quantitative ultrasound. Methods A community-based study was conducted from May 2010 to December 2012. A total of 4,305 people aged 45 years and above without excessive drinking were enrolled. A standard interview and anthropometric and laboratory blood parameters were collected for each person. The standardized ultrasound hepatic/renal ratio and hepatic attenuation rate was used to quantify LFC. Results The prevalence of NAFLD and hyperuricemia was 33.1% and 17.1%, respectively. A total of 23.5% of the NAFLD subjects had hyperuricemia, and their SUA was higher than that of non-NAFLD subjects (327.2±76.8 vs 301.9±77.4 μmol/L, P<0.001). The LFC was positively correlated with SUA (r = 0.130, P<0.001) and an independent factor for SUA (standardized β = 0.054, P<0.001). The OR for the presence of hypreuricemia was 1.175 (95% CI 1.048–1.318; P<0.001) with a 1 SD increase in the log LFC. LFC greater than 10% was related to elevated SUA and an increased presence of hyperuricemia. Conclusions LFC accumulation was associated with an increase in the prevalence of hyperuricemia and elevated SUA in our community-based population. LFC greater than 10% is related to the risk for hyperuricemia."
https://openalex.org/W2217568423,"The effect of recalcitrant hydrocarbons on the fatty acid profile from leaf, basal corm, and roots of Cyperus laxus plants cultivated in greenhouse phytoremediation systems of soils from aged oil spill-impacted sites containing from 16 to 340 g/Kg total hydrocarbons (THC) was assessed to investigate if this is a C18:3 species and if the hydrocarbon removal during the phytoremediation process has a relationship with the fatty acid profile of this plant. The fatty acid profile was specific to each vegetative organ and was strongly affected by the hydrocarbons level in the impacted sites. Leaf extracts of plants from uncontaminated soil produced palmitic acid (C16), octadecanoic acid (C18:0), unsaturated oleic acids (C18:1-C18:3), and unsaturated eichosanoic (C20:2-C20:3) acids with a noticeable absence of the unsaturated hexadecatrienoic acid (C16:3); this finding demonstrates, for the first time, that C. laxus is a C18:3 plant. In plants from the phytoremediation systems, the total fatty acid contents in the leaf and the corm were negatively affected by the hydrocarbons presence; however, the effect was positive in root. Interestingly, under contaminated conditions, unusual fatty acids such as odd numbered carbons (C15, C17, C21, and C23) and uncommon unsaturated chains (C20:3n6 and C20:4) were produced together with a remarkable quantity of C22:2 and C24:0 chains in the corm and the leaf. These results demonstrate that weathered hydrocarbons may drastically affect the lipidic composition of C. laxus at the fatty acid level, suggesting that this species adjusts the cover lipid composition in its vegetative organs, mainly in roots, in response to the weathered hydrocarbon presence and uptake during the phytoremediation process."
https://openalex.org/W2165056807,"A psychoacoustic experiment was carried out to test the effects of microphone handling noise on perceived audio quality. Handling noise is a problem affecting both amateurs using their smartphones and cameras, as well as professionals using separate microphones and digital recorders. The noises used for the tests were measured from a variety of devices, including smartphones, laptops and handheld microphones. The signal features that characterise these noises are analysed and presented. The sounds include various types of transient, impact noises created by tapping or knocking devices, as well as more sustained sounds caused by rubbing. During the perceptual tests, listeners auditioned speech podcasts and were asked to rate the degradation of any unwanted sounds they heard. A representative design test methodology was developed that tried to encourage everyday rather than analytical listening. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the handling noise events was shown to be the best predictor of quality degradation. Other factors such as noise type or background noise in the listening environment did not significantly affect quality ratings. Podcast, microphone type and reproduction equipment were found to be significant but only to a small extent. A model allowing the prediction of degradation from the SNR is presented. The SNR threshold at which 50% of subjects noticed handling noise was found to be 4.2 ± 0.6 dBA. The results from this work are important for the understanding of our perception of impact sound and resonant noises in recordings, and will inform the future development of an automated predictor of quality for handling noise."
