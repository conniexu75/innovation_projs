https://openalex.org/W2000184187,"Human islet cell tumor tissue and isolated islets of Langerhans from rats incorporated radioactive amino acids in vitro into insulin and a larger acid-alcohol soluble protein which could be separated from insulin by gel filtration. The amino acids were incorporated into the larger protein earlier than into insulin; only after incubation of islets for approximately 30 minutes did radioactivity begin to appear in insulin. The transfer of about 70 percent of the radioactivity of the larger protein to insulin was demonstrated in the absence of new peptide bond synthesis (cycloheximide), or during incubation with unlabeled amino acid (chase). The results indicate that the larger protein is a precursor in the biosynthesis of insulin. The name ""proinsulin"" is suggested for this protein."

Passage of submitochondrial particles through a Sephadex column activated the adenosine triphosphatase activity 5- to 10-fold and subsequent treatment with urea removed virtually all ATPase (coupling factor 1). The resulting submitochondrial particles, exposed sequentially to Sephadex and urea (SU-particles), catalyzed the oxidation of succinate but phosphorylation was insignificant. P:O ratios exceeding 0.5 were obtained on addition of coupling factors 1, 2, and 3. 2. Without addition of coupling factor 1, low concentrations of oligomycin or rutamycin did not stimulate phosphorylation in SU-particles. However, in the presence of coupling factor 1 and optimal concentrations of rutamycin considerable phosphorylation rates were observed. Similar to rutamycin, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide stimulated oxidative phosphorylation at low concentrations and inhibited oxidative phosphorylation at high concentrations. 3. Reconstituted SU-particles which catalyzed oxidative phosphorylation with a P:O ratio of 0.5 catalyzed the energy-driven reversal of electron flow from succinate to diphosphopyridine nucleotide at a very slow rate. However, addition of a crude mitochondrial extract restored this activity to a rate about half of that observed in the original submitochondrial particles. 4. In electron micrographs SU-particles were found to be devoid of inner membrane spheres. On reconstitution with coupling factor 1, the inner membrane spheres reappeared. The reconstituted particles were morphologically indistinguishable from untreated submitochondrial particles. Calculations indicate that coupling factor 1 is responsible for most, if not all, of the inner membrane spheres."
https://openalex.org/W1608617260,"A particulate fraction obtained from rat liver nuclei is capable of polymerizing the adenosine diphosphate ribose moiety of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide with the simultaneous release of nicotinamide. Comparative studies on this reaction and the nicotinamide mononucleotide-dependent adenosine triphosphate polymerization, originally described by Chambon, Weill, and Mandel, and later confirmed partly by Fujimura and Sugimura, reveal that both reactions are fundamentally identical and that NAD but not ATP is the immediate substrate for the polymerization. The activity, as assayed with NAD as the substrate, is essentially localized in nuclei from various organs and is markedly decreased by prior incubation of the nuclear preparation with pancreatic deoxyribonuclease but not by pancreatic ribonuclease and T1 RNase, nor is it affected by the addition of actinomycin D or any of the nucleoside triphosphates. The reaction product is resistant to either mild alkaline hydrolysis, pancreatic DNase, RNase, T1 RNase, Neurospora NADase, or various proteinases. Upon treatment with venom phosphodiesterase, more than 95% of this material is made acid-soluble to produce a single compound possessing 1 mole of adenine, 2 moles of ribose, and 2 moles of phosphate. Preliminary analysis of the reaction product suggests that it may be a hitherto unknown macromolecule composed of repeating ADP-ribose units."
https://openalex.org/W1499619607,"Abstract The rate of reaction of reduced cytochrome oxidase with oxygen has been studied under a wide range of conditions by mixing the carbon monoxide compound of the reduced oxidase with oxygen-containing buffers and initiating the reaction by liberating free reduced oxidase photochemically. The method has been improved through the use of complementary filtration procedures and careful attention to electrical and magnetic shielding to a point at which the measurement of first order constants of up to 105 per sec has been possible. With the use of a wide range of oxygen concentrations, the rate of the initial portion of the biphasic record obtained at 445 mµ increases roughly in proportion to oxygen concentration until a rate of about 104 per sec is reached, beyond which it continues to increase but no longer does so in proportion to the oxygen concentration. Good agreement with the experimental findings has been obtained with a scheme in which 1 oxygen molecule diffuses into the oxidase unit (rate, 1 x 108 m-1sec-1) followed by the first order oxidation of cytochrome a3 (3 x 104 sec-1) and of a (7 x 102 sec-1). Previous work by these authors suggests that copper associated with the oxidase unit reacts at 7 x 103 sec-1 and the present publication describes the effect of temperature on these individual steps. In no case was the effect large; it was greatest on the cytochrome a oxidation step, corresponding to a Q10 of 1.4. The improved time resolution has permitted the spectro-kinetic separation of the cytochromes a3 and a oxidized-reduced difference spectra, which, although basically similar to those obtained in static experiments, show several important differences. The isosbestic points for the a3'' - a3''' and the a'' - a''' differences are 434 mµ and 430 mµ, respectively, the converse of the findings from static difference spectrophotometry and from previous work on the dissociation of CO in the presence of O2. Another important difference is that the ratio of the contribution of cytochrome a3 to that of a at 445 mµ was 2.3:1, compared to 1:1 by the static method."
https://openalex.org/W1590313818,"Stellacyanin, or Rhus vernicifera blue protein, was purified from lac acetone powders. It is 20% carbohydrate and 20% hexosamine with the remainder being a polypeptide matrix of 108 amino acid residues in which is embedded a single cupric atom. The molecule contains no methionine or valine. Optical rotatory dispersion and optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectral studies show that the ligand field of the copper of stellacyanin contains large odd and rhombic components and is thereby distorted away from the usual square-planar axial configuration. This results in an unusual EPR spectrum and an extraordinarily intense blue color. Raising the pH of a stellacyanin solution above 8.3 relaxes the rhombic distortions. This leads to downward shifts in wave lengths of the peaks in the visible and near ultraviolet optical spectrum, and the EPR spectrum changes to that of basic copper bis-biuret. The pH may be returned from 11.5 to 8.3, restoring the original optical and EPR spectra. A pH above 11.5 produces irreversible structural changes within the molecule. It is concluded from this stepwise denaturation that the close ligands of copper in stellacyanin are 4 nitrogen atoms. Lowering the pH of a stellacyanin solution below 2.0 releases the odd constraints and the optical absorption decreases. With longer incubation the copper becomes more accessible to ethylenediaminetetraacetate so that raising the pH to neutrality does not effect a reconstitution of color. Ultraviolet optical rotatory dispersion studies indicate that stellacyanin contains little or no helical structure."
https://openalex.org/W1501008006,"Abstract Subcellular fractions of Mycobacterium phlei have been shown to catalyze the biosynthesis of several mannosyl derivatives of phosphatidylmyoinositol, to which we have given the generic name mannophosphoinositides. The major products are a family of dimannophosphoinositides, three in number, and these appear to differ only in the number of fatty acyl groups they contain. Phosphatidylmyoinositol is an effective mannose acceptor and guanosine diphosphate mannose, the sugar donor in the biosynthesis of these complex phospholipids. The three dimannophosphoinositides, A, B, and C, contain, respectively, 4, 3, and 2 moles of fatty acid per phosphate residue in the molecule. Since two of the fatty acid groups are probably present in the phosphatidyl residue, dimannophosphoinositides A and B must be acylated in addition on the mannose or myoinositol parts. The origin of these additional fatty acyl groups is unknown. The enzyme activities which catalyze the biosynthesis of the mannophosphoinositides are present in both the soluble and particulate fractions of cells disrupted by sonic treatment. The particulate enzyme can be solubilized by acetone treatment. The various enzyme activities differ in their requirements, substrate specificities, and detergent effects in ways which are not readily explainable. The acceptor ability of phosphatidylmyoinositol from different sources and following different treatments varies widely. All of these observations probably reflect the complexity of the enzyme system which undoubtedly contains several mannosyltransferases as well as the acylating activity. As a working hypothesis, we suggest that GDP-mannose acts as the donor in the conversion of phosphatidylmyoinositol to phosphatidylmyoinositol dimannoside (dimannophosphoinositide C), and the latter is then acylated in a two-step process to yield first dimannophosphoinositide B and then dimannophosphoinositide A. Alternatively, the intermediate monomannophosphoinositide could be acylated before addition of the second mannose, leading then directly to dimannophosphoinositide B. Presumably, these substances are all precursors of the higher polymannophosphoinositides, including the pentamannoside."
https://openalex.org/W63817432,"Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (EC 2.7.6.1.) from Escherichia coli is inhibited by adenosine diphosphate and to a much smaller extent by other nucleotides and by tryptophan. We propose (a) that the adenosine diphosphate effect is part of a general adenosine triphosphate conservation system that causes the rate of expenditure of ATP to be sharply curtailed when the energy charge of the cell decreases slightly; and (b) that, as appears to be the case with phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate synthase, such ATP conservation control may be superposed on product negative feedback regulation of the same enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1675077779,"A particulate fraction from rat liver nuclei catalyzes polymerization of the adenosine diphosphate ribose moiety of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide into an acid-insoluble polymer with the simultaneous release of nicotinamide. The polymer, prepared by reaction in vitro, can be phenol-extracted and gives a single symmetrical peak upon equilibrium cesium sulfate density gradient centrifugation at a density slightly lighter than transfer ribonucleic acid. On methylated albumin kieselguhr it chromatographs as a broad peak, and, upon centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient, it sediments at S values ranging up to 12 S with a peak at 4 S. The poylmer does not appear to be covalently linked to other nucleic acids or proteins. Venom phosphodiesterase converts the polymer to acid-soluble form with release, primarily, of a single compound containing adenine, ribose, and phosphate in a ratio of 1:2:2. Tracer experiments indicate that this compound is an isomer of ADP-ribose derived from NAD. Available evidence suggests that the polymer is composed of ADP-ribose units linked together through ribose-ribose linkages."

Infectivity and induction of complement-fixing antigen and DNA synthesis declined as a logarithmic function of dose, the latter two properties being more resistant than infectivity to radiation by a factor of 2 to 5. Oncogenicity of all three viruses did not decrease with progressive amounts of both types of irradiation, but actually increased in absolute and relative terms (per infectious unit), even at the maximum dose of irradiation used (24,000 ergs per square millimeter per minute and 2.7 x 10(6) rads)."
https://openalex.org/W43340758,Cell-free particulate fractions from Escherichia coli have been found to catalyze the synthesis of cardiolipin from cytidine diphosphate diglyceride and l -glycerol 3-phosphate. Evidence is presented that phosphatidylglycerol is the immediate precursor of cardiolipin in a reaction involving the transfer of a phosphatidyl moiety from CDP-diglyceride.
https://openalex.org/W1542093177,"Abstract When Escherichia coli in exponential phase of growth are treated in sequence with 1 x 10-4 m ethylenediaminetetraacetate- -0.033 m Tris, pH 7.3–0.5 m sucrose, and then with cold 5 x 10-4 MgCl2, a set of hydrolytic enzymes is selectively released into the dilute MgCl2 solution (shock fluid). This procedure, osmotic shock, has no deleterious effect on viability. Shocked cells can be successfully stored for 3 hours at room temperature before being transferred to growth medium. On being restored to a nutrient medium, the shocked cells do not resume growth at once, but only after a lag period of 30 to 40 min. During this time they are unusually sensitive to Actinomycin D; to bacteriophage T4 infection; to the presence of lysozyme, ribonuclease, or deoxyribonuclease in the medium; and to ethylenediaminetetraacetate. Presumably, osmotic shock has caused a lesion to the cell envelope which is largely repaired during the lag period. E. coli subjected to osmotic shock have difficulty in adapting to synthetic growth media when previously grown on a richer, semidefined medium. Adaptation to galactose is also defective. Active transport of l-leucine is impaired, confirming a report in the literature. Incorporation of l-leucine, uracil, and thymine into an acid-insoluble fraction is reduced during the lag period, and this may be due in part to poor uptake. Resynthesis of the enzymes that were released by osmotic shock takes place during the recovery period, but three generations of growth are required before normal levels are restored. On a suitable medium nearly normal growth rates are obtained, even when the levels of enzyme are very low. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate serves a double purpose in the osmotic shock procedure. It greatly improves the selective release of certain hydrolytic enzymes. It also enables bacteria to withstand osmotic shock more successfully, as judged by reduced leakage of β-galactosidase, protein, and other material absorbing at 260 mµ."
https://openalex.org/W1547519509,"Abstract Staphylococcal nuclease binds various nucleotides in a 1:1 molar ratio. This binding is completely dependent on the presence of Ca++ and is prevented by high urea concentrations and by various chemical modifications of the protein. Dissociation constants have been determined for a number of nucleotide-enzyme complexes. There are good correlations between the affinities of binding and the strengths of inhibition of polynucleotide hydrolysis by the various nucleotides. The dissociation constants vary, just as enzyme activity varies, with pH and Ca++ concentration. The nucleotides studied all bind to the same region of the enzyme, which appears to be the same as the catalytically active site and is probably responsible for hydrolysis of deoxyribo- and ribonucleic acid. It is suggested that the structural unit of the substrate responsible for specific enzyme recognition and binding is a 3',5'-diphosphonucleoside region. Ca++ is bound weakly to the enzyme in a 1:1 molar ratio if monophosphonucleoside derivatives are present, and in a 2:1 ratio if deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate is present. No Ca++ binding occurs in the absence of nucleotide or substrate. Nucleotides (or substrates) and Ca++ are bound to nuclease in a unique complex which forms only when all three components are present concurrently."

https://openalex.org/W5049569,"Abstract An isozyme of malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) from pea seeds has been isolated. The effect of NaCl on the kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme has been studied at four pH values, at all of which the results were essentially the same. The activity of the isozyme increases with increasing salt concentrations up to 0.02 m. Higher concentrations are inhibitory. Salt increases the apparent maximal velocity of the reaction and decreases the affinity of oxalacetate for the enzyme. At NaCl concentrations inhibitory to reduction of oxalacetate, the kinetics is that of competitive inhibition. The Km for reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide is not affected by salt. The effect of sodium ion is nonspecific, since other univalent cations behave similarly."

https://openalex.org/W1491412691,"Abstract Kinetic studies have been performed with crystalline dogfish liver glutamate dehydrogenase with the diphosphopyridine nucleotides as cofactors. The kinetic constants for the various substrates have been determined. In its sensitivity to guanosine 5'-triphosphate, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, and excess reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide the enzyme is similar to that derived from other vertebrates. The extent of inhibition of the initial rate of the aminating reaction by excess reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide was reduced by the presence of increased ammonium chloride in the reaction mixture. The effect is attributable to the chloride ion. A number of anions have been tested, and the order of their effectiveness in preventing inhibition by excess reduced coenzyme followed the Hofmeister series: ClO4- g SCN- g I- g Br- g Cl- g F-. Peak effectiveness was observed at comparatively low concentrations of salts, varying from 0.045 m ClO4- to 0.25 m Cl-. Further increase in salt concentration caused a progressive decrease in the rate of reaction. Concentrations of salts that were effective in preventing inhibition by excess reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide were observed to depress activity at noninhibitory levels of coenzyme. Added salt does not affect the calculated maximum velocity of the reaction but does increase the apparent Km for the diphosphopyridine nucleotide and effectively prevents inhibition at high concentrations of the cofactor. The presence of added salt minimized the regulatory influence of the nucleotides guanosine 5'-triphosphate and adenosine 5'-diphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1622216487,"Although never demonstrated unequivocally, it has been generally accepted that the largest fraction of the ribonucleic acid of mammalian cells is ribosomal. However, it has been reported recently that about 65% of rat liver RNA has a nonribosomal sedimentation coefficient in the range of 4 S. To resolve the question of the ribosomal RNA content of rat liver and to examine the validity of the assumption that the total RNA content of mammalian tissue can be taken as an approximate measure of ribosome content, isotope dilution analysis has been used in the present study for quantitative determination of ribosomal RNA, since this technique yields valid minimal values in this application. These measurements indicate that, of total rat liver RNA, the ribosomal fraction constitutes 85 to 90%, and 4 S RNA, about 7%. The fraction of ribosomal RNA relative to the total remained unchanged despite a period of fasting sufficient to reduce the RNA per hepatic cell to about half the normal value. A rapidly growing neoplasm, the Novikoff hepatoma, was found to contain the same amount of ribosomal RNA, relative to total, as did the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1579084054,"The amino acid compositions of two peptides, obtained from homologous regions of the α1 chains of rat skin and tail tendon collagen by CNBr cleavage, were found to differ only in their contents of hydroxyproline and proline. Sequence analyses of these peptides, each of which contained 36 amino acids, indicated that their primary structures prior to the hydroxylation of proline were identical and that the prolyl residues susceptible to hydroxylation were the same. However, hydroxylation of individual residues was incomplete in both peptides, the degree of hydroxylation of several residues being greater in the peptide from skin collagen. The data indicate that the primary structure of collagen is heterogeneous as a consequence of this incomplete hydroxylation, and provide preliminary information regarding the substrate specificity of proline hydroxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1516422516,"Abstract Adenosine 5'-monophosphate, an inhibitor of the d-fructose 1,6-diphosphatase isolated from Candida utilis, induces a specific dissociation of this enzyme at pH 9.2. On the basis of sucrose density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, it may be concluded that the molecule has dissociated into subunits having one-half the molecular weight of the native enzyme. The dissociation occurs only at alkaline pH and in the cold. It is prevented by low concentrations of fructose 1,6-diphosphate (0.01 mm). d-Fructose 1,6-diphosphatase which has been desensitized to the inhibitory action of 5'-AMP is not dissociated. The results suggest that the dissociation induced by 5'-AMP may be an extreme manifestation of more subtle alterations in the quaternary structure of the enzyme which occur in the presence of substrate at physiological pH."
