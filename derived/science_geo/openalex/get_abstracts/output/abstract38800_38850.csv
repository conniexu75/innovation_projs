https://openalex.org/W1537851214,"Cloned bovine aortic endothelial cells were cultured with [35S]Na2SO4 and proteolyzed extensively with papain. Radiolabeled heparan sulfate was isolated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. The mucopolysaccharide was then affinity fractionated into two separate populations utilizing immobilized antithrombin. The heparan sulfate, which bound tightly to the protease inhibitor, represented 0.84% of the mucopolysaccharide mass, accounted for greater than 99% of the initial anticoagulant activity, and exhibited a specific activity of 1.16 USP units/10(6) 35S-cpm. However, the heparan sulfate that interacted minimally with the protease inhibitor constituted greater than 99% of the mucopolysaccharide mass, represented less than 1% of the starting biologic activity, and possessed a specific anticoagulant potency of less than 0.0002 USP unit/10(6) 35S-cpm. An examination of the disaccharide composition of the two populations revealed that the high-affinity heparan sulfate contained a 4-fold or greater amount of GlcA----GlcN-SO3-3-O-SO3 (where GlcA is glucuronic acid), which is a marker for the antithrombin-binding domain of commercial heparin, as compared with the depleted material. Cloned bovine aortic endothelial cells were incubated with [35S]Na2SO4 as well as tritiated amino acids and completely solubilized with 4 M guanidine hydrochloride and detergents. The double-labeled proteoglycans were isolated by DEAE-Sephacel, Sepharose CL-4B, and octyl-Sepharose chromatography. These hydrophobic macromolecules were then affinity fractionated into two separate populations utilizing immobilized antithrombin. The heparan sulfate proteoglycans which bound tightly to the protease inhibitor represented less than 1% of the starting material and exhibited a specific anticoagulant activity as high as 21 USP units/10(6) 35S-cpm, whereas the heparan sulfate proteoglycan that interacted weakly with the protease inhibitor constituted greater than 99% of the starting material and possessed a specific anticoagulant potency as high as 0.02 USP unit/10(6) 35S-cpm. The high-affinity heparan sulfate proteoglycan is responsible for more than 85% of the anticoagulant activity of the cloned bovine aortic endothelial cells. Binding studies conducted with 125I-labeled antithrombin demonstrated that these biologically active proteoglycans are located on the surface of cloned bovine aortic endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2012819319,"The precise association of DNA-binding proteins with localized regions of DNA is crucial for regulated replication and expression of the genome. For certain DNA transactions, the requirement for precision in localization and control is extremely high. High-precision events amenable to detailed biochemical analysis are the initiation of DNA replication and site-specific recombination by bacteriophage Î» and Escherichia coli. Recent experiments indicate that site-localization and control in these reactions involves the association of DNA-bound proteins to generate organized nucleoprotein structures in which the DNA is folded or wound. These specialized nucleoprotein structures are likely to provide the requisite accuracy for site localization and the necessary regulated reactivity to direct the DNA transaction. Multiple DNA-protein interactions are also required for controlled transcription of the eukaryotic genome. Distant upstream regulator and enhancer sequences may define protein-binding sites that form part of a reactive nucleoprotein structure capable of initiating transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2081949838,"Variation in influenza A viruses was examined by comparison of nucleotide sequences of the NS gene (890 bases) of 15 human viruses isolated over 53 years (1933 to 1985). Changes in the genes accumulate with time, and an evolutionary tree based on the maximum parsimony method can be constructed. The evolutionary rate is approximately 2 X 10(-3) substitution per site per year in the NS genes, which is about 10(6) times the evolutionary rate of germline genes in mammals. This uniform and rapid rate of evolution in the NS gene is a good molecular clock and is compatible with the hypothesis that positive selection is operating on the hemagglutinin (or perhaps some other viral genes) to preserve random mutations in the NS gene."
https://openalex.org/W1531637520,"Vitamin K-dependent protein S exists in two forms in plasma, as free protein and in a bimolecular, noncovalent complex with the regulatory complement protein C4b-binding protein (C4BP). The effects of C4BP on the protein Ca cofactor activity of protein S were studied in a plasma system and in a system using purified components from both human and bovine origin. Bovine protein S was found to interact with human C4BP with a 5-fold higher affinity than that observed for the interaction between human protein S and human C4BP. The binding of protein S, from either species, to human C4BP results in the loss of the protein Ca cofactor function. In bovine plasma, protein S could be totally complexed by the addition of human C4BP, with a concomitant total loss of protein Ca cofactor activity. The addition of purified human C4BP to human plasma resulted in only partial loss of protein Ca cofactor activity and the plasma protein S was not completely complexed. Human protein S functioned as a cofactor to human protein Ca, but not to bovine protein Ca, whereas bovine protein S demonstrated very little species specificity and functioned as a cofactor both with human and bovine protein Ca. The species specificity of the protein Ca-protein S interaction was useful in elucidating the effect of C4BP in the plasma system. In the system with purified bovine components, protein S was required for the degradation of factor Va by low concentrations of protein Ca, whereas in the system with human components protein Ca alone, even when added at very low concentrations, exhibited potential to degrade factor Va, and the presence of protein S only enhanced the reaction rate approximately 5-fold. In both these systems, the stimulating effect of protein S on factor Va degradation by protein Ca was completely lost when protein S bound to C4BP."
https://openalex.org/W1586547911,"Abstract A 36-kDa protein, which is a component of the membrane skeleton, has been shown to co-localize with spectrin in addition to serving as a major substrate for tyrosine-protein kinases. This protein, which will be referred to as calpactin (for calcium-dependent phospholipid and actin binding protein), was isolated from bovine intestine as the complex with a 10-kilodalton light chain and the Ca2+ binding was analyzed by equilibrium dialysis with 45Ca2+ in the presence or absence of phospholipid. Although Ca2+ binding by calpactin alone was negligible at micromolar free Ca2+, it was greatly enhanced by liposomes containing phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylinositol. A proteolytic derivative of calpactin, termed the core, which has lost the site of association with the light chain in addition to the site of tyrosine phosphorylation by pp60src, was also found to contain this high affinity phospholipid enhanced Ca2+-binding activity. Scatchard plots reveal that each calpactin monomer or core polypeptide bound 2 Ca2+ ions with a Kd of 4.5 X 10(-6) M at 200 micrograms of phosphatidylserine/ml. Liposome binding experiments confirmed that calpactin as a complex with light chain as well as calpactin monomer or the 33-kDa core interact with phosphatidylserine liposomes in a Ca2+-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1575753161,"Chemical reduction of human plasma lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) yielded two water-soluble products which were separated by rate zonal ultracentrifugation. Apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) was completely recovered from the bottom of the gradient, whereas lipoprotein(a-) (Lp(a-)), which contained all of the lipids and apo-B100 of Lp(a), floated. By the techniques of circular dichroism and viscometry Lp(a-) was identical to low density lipoprotein (LDL). Lp(a-) was slightly larger in mass than autologous LDL and contained proportionally more triglyceride. The difference in mass between Lp(a) and Lp(a-) was accounted for by the loss of 2 molecules of apo(a) from the Lp(a) particle. The molecular weight of reduced and carboxymethylated apo(a) was 281,000 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium in 6 M guanidine HCl. By circular dichroism the structure of apo(a) was mostly random (71%) with the remainder representing 8% alpha-helix and 21% beta-sheet; its intrinsic viscosity, 28.3 cm3/g, was consistent with an extended flexible coil. The amino acid composition was characterized by an unusually high content of proline (11.4 mol %) as well as tryptophan, tyrosine, arginine, threonine, and a low amount of lysine, phenylalanine, and isoleucine. Apo(a) contained 28.1% carbohydrate by weight represented by mannose, galactose, galactosamine, glucosamine, and sialic acid in an approximate molar ratio of 3:7:5:4:7, respectively. Overall, the structure of Lp(a) appears to be consistent with a rigid spherical LDL-like core particle which, as a consequence of its association with a flexible glycoprotein such as apo(a), favors the entrapment of significant amounts of hydrodynamically associated solvent. Furthermore, the Lp(a-) remnant generated by the removal of apo(a) from Lp(a) was similar in structure but not identical to autologous LDL."
https://openalex.org/W2049813979,"The chitin synthase of Saccharomyces is a plasma membrane-bound zymogen. Following proteolytic activation, the enzyme synthesizes insoluble chitin that has chain length and other physical properties similar to chitin found in bud scars. We isolated mutants lacking chitin synthase activity (chs1) and used these to clone CHS1. The gene has an open reading frame of 3400 bases and encodes a protein of 130 kd. The fission yeast S. pombe lacks chitin synthase and chitin. When a plasmid encoding a CHS1-lacZ fusion protein is introduced into S. pombe, both enzymatic activities are expressed in the same ratio as in S. cerevisiae, demonstrating that CHS1 encodes the structural gene of chitin synthase. Three CHS1 gene disruption experiments were performed. In all cases, strains with the disrupted gene have a recognizable phenotype, lack measurable chitin synthase activity in vitro but are viable, contain normal levels of chitin in vivo, and mate and sporulate efficiently."

https://openalex.org/W2009951300,"Despite the requirement for a functional signal sequence in protein export, little is known of the conformational properties and membrane interactions of these highly hydrophobic amino terminal extensions on nearly all exported proteins. The Escherichia coli lambda phage receptor signal sequence was studied in phospholipid monolayers by circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; the signal peptide was shown to prefer an alpha-helical conformation when inserted into the lipid phase. However, interaction with the lipid surface without insertion induced the signal sequence, which is unstructured in bulk aqueous solution, to adopt a beta structure. These observations are combined in a model for the initial steps in signal sequence-membrane interaction in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1584887355,"Escherichia coli helicase II, product of the uvrD gene, is a single-stranded DNA-dependent nucleoside 5'-triphosphatase with helicase activity. As a DNA-dependent ATPase, helicase II translocates processively along single-stranded DNA (S. W. Matson, unpublished results). The direction of translocation has been determined using a helicase assay that directly measures the ability of helicase II to catalyze the displacement of a labeled DNA fragment from one end of a single-stranded linear DNA molecule. The translocation of helicase II along single-stranded DNA is unidirectional and in the 3' to 5' direction with respect to the DNA strand on which the enzyme is bound. A kinetic analysis of the displacement of a labeled DNA fragment annealed to a linear single-stranded DNA molecule is also consistent with unidirectional translocation in the 3' to 5' direction. These results are contrary to results previously obtained using an indirect helicase assay (Kuhn, B., Abdel-Monem, M., Krell, H., and Hoffmann-Berling, H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11343-11350)."
https://openalex.org/W1577883243,"The omega-conotoxins, a class of Ca2+ channel antagonists from fish-hunting marine snails, have recently been described (Olivera, B. M., McIntosh, J. M., Zeikus, R., Gray, W. R., Varga, J., Rivier, J., de Santos, V., and Cruz, L. J. (1985) Science, 230, 1338-1343). One of these peptide neurotoxins, omega-conotoxin GVIA, was radiolabeled with iodine, and the 125I-labeled toxin was shown to bind specifically to high affinity sites on chick brain synaptosomes. The toxin-receptor complex was extremely stable; addition of an excess of unlabeled toxin did not cause significant displacement of the labeled toxin after 2 h. Binding competition data suggest that omega-conotoxin defines a new high affinity receptor site affecting voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, distinct from both the verapamil and dihydropyridine target sites."
https://openalex.org/W2003110930,"Different hematopoietic cells produce minute amounts of Î²-related interferon (IFN) following induction of differentiation by chemical or natural inducers. The endogenous IFN binds to type I cell surface receptors and modulates gene expression in the producer ceils. We show that self-induction of two members of the IFN-induced gene family differs in the dose response sensitivity and the prolonged kinetics of mRNA accumulation from the response to exogenous IFN-Î²1. Production and response to endogenous IFN are also detected when bone marrow precursor cells differentiate to macrophages after exposure to colony stimulating factor 1. In M1 myeloid cells induced to differentiate by lung-conditioned medium, addition of antibodies against IFN-Î² partially abrogates the reduction of c-myc mRNA and the loss in cell proliferative activity, which both occur during differentiation. The endogenous IFN therefore functions as an autocrine growth inhibitor that participates in controlling c-myc suppression and the specific arrest during terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1502661652,"The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan of rat brain was digested with Pronase, and after removal of glycosaminoglycans, the resulting glycopeptides were treated with alkaline borohydride to release O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides. These were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and preparative thin layer chromatography, and their structural properties were studied by specific enzymatic degradations, methylation analysis, and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of disaccharides as their trimethylsilylated and permethylated derivatives. In addition to the previously characterized N-acetyl-galactosamine-linked oligosaccharides and neutral mannitol-containing oligosaccharides [GlcNAc(beta 1-3) Manol and Gal(beta 1-4)[Fuc(alpha 1-3)]GlcNAc(beta 1-3)Manol] (where Fuc is fucose), we have now identified the sialylated tetrasaccharide NeuAc(alpha 2-3)Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc (beta 1-3)Manol, which accounts for approximately 20% of the mannitol-containing oligosaccharides. The proteoglycan also contains mannose-linked keratan sulfate chains (with a molecular size of 3,000 to 10,000 Da) composed of disaccharide repeating units consisting of Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc-6-O-SO4(beta 1-3), with a small proportion of branch points at C-6 of galactose residues. There is approximately one keratan sulfate chain per four chondroitin sulfate chains of 18,000-19,000 Da. After alkaline borohydride treatment of the neutral and monosialyl glycopeptide fractions, the combined decrease in mannose and N-acetylgalactosamine was very close to the observed destruction of serine + threonine and was accompanied by an equimolar increase in alanine and alpha-aminobutyric acid. One half of the mannose was destroyed by alkaline borohydride treatment of the glycopeptides and stoichiometrically converted to mannitol, while there were only small changes in the relative amounts of the other sugars and amino acids. The data demonstrate that over half of the carbohydrate-peptide linkages in the proteoglycan are of the mannosyl-O-serine/threonine type."
https://openalex.org/W1496490740,"The red genes of phage lambda specify two proteins, exonuclease and beta protein, which are essential for its general genetic recombination in recA- cells. These proteins seem to occur in vivo as an equimolar complex. In addition, beta protein forms a complex with another polypeptide, probably of phage origin, of Mr 70,000. The 70-kDa protein appears to be neither a precursor nor an aggregated form of either exonuclease or beta protein, since antibodies directed against the latter two proteins failed to react with 70-kDa protein on Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis. beta protein promotes Mg2+-dependent renaturation of complementary strands (Kmiec, E., and Holloman, W. K. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 12636-12639). To look for other pairing activities of beta protein, we developed methods of purification to free it of associated exonuclease. Exonuclease-free beta protein appeared unable to cause the pairing of a single strand with duplex DNA; however, like Escherichia coli single strand binding protein (SSB), beta protein stimulated formation of joint molecules by recA protein from linear duplex DNA and homologous circular single strands. Like recA protein, but unlike SSB, beta protein promoted the joining of the complementary single-stranded ends of phage lambda DNA. beta protein specifically protected single-stranded DNA from digestion by pancreatic DNase. The half-time for renaturation catalyzed by beta protein was independent of DNA concentration, unlike renaturation promoted by SSB and spontaneous renaturation, which are second order reactions. Thus, beta protein resembles recA protein in its ability to bring single-stranded DNA molecules together and resembles SSB in its ability to reduce secondary structure in single-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1508581548,"A monoclonal antibody, A1, was produced against sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis purified canine phospholamban and isolated from mouse ascites by chromatography on a hydroxylapatite column. Western immunoblotting experiments showed that the antibody was specific for phospholamban and cross-reacted with the protein from a bovine source. Incubation of bovine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles with the antibody resulted in a marked increase in the ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump activity which was slightly higher than that brought about by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. This observation provides direct proof for the involvement of phospholamban as a SR Ca2+ pump regulatory protein. In addition to stimulating the Ca2+ pump activity, antibody A1 was capable of blocking the phosphorylation of phospholamban by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and by an endogenous SR Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. It was also capable of blocking the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated phospholamban by an endogenous SR protein phosphatase. From these observations, it may be suggested that the antigenic site of A1 antibody is proximal to the phosphorylation sites of phospholamban."

https://openalex.org/W1492670710,"Four monoclonal antibodies were produced that inhibit IgE binding to the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon R) on rat basophilic leukemia cells. The four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) fall into two groups. The first group was comprised of 3 antibodies (mAb BC4, mAb CD3, and mAb CA5) that reacted with the Fc epsilon R at epitopes close or identical to the IgE-binding site. With 125I-labeled antibodies there was reciprocal cross-inhibition between the antibodies and IgE. The antibodies activated both RBL-2H3 cells and normal rat mast cells for histamine release. The 3 antibodies immunoprecipitated the previously described alpha, beta, and gamma components of the receptor. The number of radiolabeled Fab fragments of 2 of these antibodies bound per cell was similar or equal to the number of IgE receptors. In contrast, the mAb BC4 Fab bound to 2.1 +/- 0.4 times the number of IgE receptor sites. Therefore, the portion of the Fc epsilon R exposed on the cell surface must have two identical epitopes and an axis of symmetry. These 3 monoclonal antibodies recognize different but closely related epitopes in the IgE-binding region of the Fc epsilon R. The fourth monoclonal antibody (mAb AA4) had different characteristics. In cross-inhibition studies, IgE and the other 3 monoclonals did not inhibit the binding of this 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody. The number of molecules of this antibody bound per cell was approximately 14-fold greater than the Fc epsilon R number. This monoclonal antibody caused the inhibition of histamine release and it appears to bind to several cell components."
https://openalex.org/W1517924156,"Actin contains a single high-affinity cation-binding site, for which Ca2+ and Mg2+ can compete, and multiple low-affinity cation-binding sites, which can bind Ca2+, Mg2+, or K+. Binding of cations to the low-affinity sites causes polymerization of monomeric actin with either Ca2+ or Mg2+ at the high-affinity site. A rapid conformational change occurs upon binding of cations to the low-affinity sites (G----G) which is apparently associated with the initiation of polymerization. A much slower conformational change (G----G', or G----G' if the low-affinity sites are also occupied) follows the replacement of Ca2+ by Mg2+ at the high-affinity site. This slow conformational change is reflected in a 13% increase in the fluorescence of G-actin labeled with the fluorophore 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzene-2-oxadiazole (NBD-labeled actin). The rate of the ATP hydrolysis that accompanies elongation is slower with Ca-G-actin than with Mg-G'-actin (i.e. with Ca2+ rather than Mg2+ at the high-affinity site) although their rates of elongation are similar. The slow ATP hydrolysis on Ca-F-actin causes a lag in the increase in fluorescence associated with the elongation of actin labeled with the fluorophore N-pyrene iodoacetamide (pyrenyl-labeled actin), even though there is no lag in the elongation rate, because pyrenyl-labeled ATP-F-actin subunits have a lower fluorescence intensity than pyrenyl-labeled ADP-F-actin subunits. The effects of the cation bound to the high-affinity binding site must, therefore, be considered in quantitatively analyzing the kinetics of polymerization of NBD-labeled actin and pyrenyl-labeled actin. Although their elongation rates are not very different, the rate of nucleation is much slower for Ca-G-actin than for Mg-G'-actin, probably because of the slower rate of ATP hydrolysis when Ca2+ is bound to the high-affinity site."
https://openalex.org/W1582119629,"Calpactin I, a Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding cytoskeletal protein, which serves as a major substrate of protein-tyrosine kinases, was isolated from bovine intestine and lung as a species containing two 36-kDa heavy chains and two 10-kDa light chains. The heavy chain is comprised of two distinct domains which can be identified by limited proteolysis: a COOH-terminal 33-kDa core, which contains the Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding sites, and an NH2-terminal tail, which contains the major site of phosphorylation by pp60v-src. To determine the site of association of the light chain on the heavy chain, we analyzed the association states of the light chain, core, and tail by sucrose gradient centrifugation after limited chymotryptic digestion. The core was not detected in higher Mr complexes with the light chain, and the tail cosedimented with a light chain dimer. The tail, isolated from chymotryptic digests and radiolabeled with 125I, was found to form a specific complex with the light chain, but not the core. The authentic tail and a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1-29 of the calpactin I heavy chain were both able to specifically inhibit the reassociation between heavy and light chain, whereas a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 15-33 was inactive. These results suggest that the tail may serve as a site of regulation by light chain or phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1575848162,"The adenovirus-encoded 140-kDa DNA polymerase (Ad Pol) and the 59-kDa DNA binding protein (Ad DBP) are both required for the replication of viral DNA in vivo and in vitro. Previous studies demonstrated that, when poly(dT).oligo(dA) was used as a template-primer, both proteins were required for poly(dA) synthesis. In this report, the interaction between the Ad Pol and Ad DBP was further investigated using poly(dT).oligo(dA) as well as a linear duplex molecule containing 3' poly(dT) tails. DNA synthesis with the tailed template required Ad Pol, Ad DBP, and an oligo(dA) primer hydrogen bonded to the poly(dT) tails. Incorporation was stimulated 8-10-fold by ATP; however, no evidence of ATP hydrolysis to ADP was observed. Synthesis was initiated at either end of the tailed molecule and proceeded through the duplex region to the end of the molecule. This ability to translocate through duplex DNA and to synthesize long poly(dA) chains suggests that the Ad Pol.Ad DBP complex can act efficiently in the elongation reactions involved in the replication of Ad DNA (both type I and type II). During the replication reaction, substantial hydrolysis of deoxynucleoside triphosphates to the corresponding deoxynucleoside monophosphates occurred. This reaction required DNA synthesis and most likely reflects an idling reaction similar to that observed with other DNA polymerases containing 3'----5' exonuclease activity in which the polymerase first incorporates and then hydrolyzes a dNMP."
https://openalex.org/W1527414083,"The interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, the leukocyte-specific membrane glycoprotein, T200, and the class I major histocompatibility antigens (HLA) have been identified as substrates for protein kinase C in vitro. IL-2 receptors on normal human T lymphocytes and the leukemic cell line, HUT102B2, are rapidly phosphorylated in vivo in response to the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Tryptic peptide analysis showed that the in vitro and in vivo 32P-labeled IL-2 receptors were phosphorylated on the same sites. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the IL-2 receptor was shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C. Tryptic digestion of the peptide generated the same 32P-labeled species as those found for the IL-2 receptor. From these studies, it was concluded that Ser-247 is the major site of phosphorylation in the IL-2 receptor and that Thr-250 is a minor site. These results also provide direct evidence that the in vivo phosphorylation of the IL-2 receptor stimulated by TPA is catalyzed by protein kinase C. The sites phosphorylated in the HLA antigens in vitro by protein kinase C or in vivo after TPA stimulation were also localized to the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the heavy chain by limited proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1516634221,"A family of variants of the PRM promoter of lambda phage was constructed, bearing nine base pair substitutions in a stretch of the spacer DNA separating the contacted -10 and -35 regions. The substituted sequences were chosen for their potential to adopt structures different from those of average B-form DNA and thus to affect the interaction of RNA polymerase with the two contacted regions. Characterization of the promoters in vitro and in vivo provides additional support for the lack of specific contacts in the substituted spacer region and shows that a small change in the relative rotational orientation of the -10 and -35 regions is inconsequential to promoter function. However, a 2-3-fold reduction in promoter activity is observed with promoters bearing substitutions of nonalternating dG-dC base pairs in either orientation. This corroborates other studies indicating the anomalous behavior of such sequences and suggests that the structure of the spacer DNA can modulate promoter recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1576186528,"Calcium release from the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase was investigated at 6 degrees C under a variety of conditions using the purified ATPase protein and the rapid membrane filtration system. The rate of calcium release measured in the presence of [ethylene bis-(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid increased monotonically with increasing pH of the medium, the time at which 50% of the bound calcium was released being reduced to one third when the pH was raised from 5.5 to 9.0. Dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 or 20% (v/v) also was very effective in accelerating the calcium release. ATP at a millimolar concentration range also was stimulatory, but millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ were found to be inhibitory. Using an indirect method, i.e. by measuring the overall rate of calcium transport by the reconstituted vesicles under conditions where calcium release from the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme was presumably rate-limiting, the calcium release was shown to be accelerated up to 1.5-fold by the inside-negative potential imposed across the membrane using the K+-valinomycin system. As evidence was presented suggesting that the observed calcium release primarily reflects the phosphoenzyme isomerization which leads to reduction in calcium affinity of the phosphoenzyme, the results strongly suggest that this phosphoenzyme isomerization was affected significantly by each of the factors described above."
https://openalex.org/W1605366140,"Schwann cells cocultured with sensory neurons in a serum-free medium accumulate a single species of radiolabeled heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HS-PG) during incubation in medium containing 35SO4. This HS-PG was poorly extracted from cultures by solutions containing 1% Triton X-100 in low salt buffer or by solutions containing 1 M KCl, 4 M urea plus dithiothreitol, 1 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, or 100 micrograms/ml of heparin. The HS-PG was efficiently extracted, however, by 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of 1 M KCl or by 1% deoxycholate. These treatments solubilize both cell membranes and the Schwann cell cytoskeleton. In intact cells the HS-PG was digested by trypsin, indicating it was at least partially exposed on the cell surface. When solubilized HS-PG was applied to a column of octyl-sepharose CL-4B, more than 90% was retained by the column, but was quantitatively eluted by a solution containing 1% Triton X-100. In addition, the solubilized HS-PG could be incorporated into artificial phospholipid vesicles. These results indicate the HS-PG is an integral plasma membrane protein. The inability of low ionic strength solutions containing Triton X-100 to solubilize the HS-PG suggested it was bound to an additional structure. To determine whether the HS-PG was associated with the cytoskeleton we isolated cytoskeletons by detergent lysis of cells and centrifugation. The major protein components of isolated cytoskeletons were spectrin (Mr 225,000), vimentin (Mr 58,000), and actin (Mr 45,000). When 35SO4-labeled cells were used to prepare cytoskeletons approximately 80% of the total HS-PG was recovered in the cytoskeleton fraction. These results suggest the HS-PG is an externally exposed integral plasma membrane protein that is anchored to the Schwann cell cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1490914758,"We have investigated the oligosaccharide requirements of the UDP-GlcNAc:glycoprotein N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferases from rat liver, Acanthamoeba castellani, and Dictyostelium discoideum. Uteroferrin, an acid hydrolase, was phosphorylated by the three N-acetylglucosaminylphosphotransferases, and the phosphorylated oligosaccharides were isolated and analyzed by ion suppression high performance liquid chromatography. In all three cases, the phosphorylated species contained 6 or more mannose residues. Phosphorylation of the Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide could not be detected even though this was the major species on the native uteroferrin. The Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides lack alpha 1,2-linked mannose residues, whereas the larger oligosaccharides contain 1 or more mannose residues in this linkage. Treatment of intact uteroferrin with an alpha 1,2-specific mannosidase-generated molecules whose oligosaccharides consisted almost entirely of species with 5 mannose residues. The N-acetylglucosaminylphosphotransferases could no longer phosphorylate such molecules. These data indicate that at least 1 alpha 1,2-linked mannose residue must be present on uteroferrin's oligosaccharide for phosphorylation to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1543370562,"Thrombospondin (TSP) is a multifunctional platelet alpha-granule and extracellular matrix glycoprotein that binds specifically to plasminogen (Plg) via that protein's lysine-binding site and modulates activation by tissue activator (TPA). In this study we report that the plasminogen activators, TPA and urokinase, greatly influence the binding of Plg to TSP. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a TSP-Sepharose affinity bead-binding assay we have found that Plg-TSP complex formation was markedly enhanced (up to 5-fold) when catalytic concentrations of Plg activators were included in the reaction mixtures. The enhancement was dependent upon the generation of small amounts of active plasmin and was duplicated by pretreatment of the immobilized TSP with plasmin prior to addition of the Plg. The enhancement effect was associated with selective proteolysis of the immobilized TSP. Purified Lys-Plg (the plasmin modified form of native Glu-Plg) bound to TSP to a greater extent than Glu-Plg, and binding of both forms was augmented by Plg activators. The apparent KD values of complex formation were unchanged in the presence of Plg activators suggesting that the enhancement effect was due to the generation of additional binding sites. The increased amount of bound Plg was demonstrated to result in a similar increase in the amount of plasmin generated from the complexes by TPA. Plg activators did not influence binding of Plg to histidine-rich glycoprotein or of histidine-rich glycoprotein to TSP, demonstrating specificity. In addition when TSP was treated with other proteases (human thrombin or human leukocyte elastase) no augmentation of Plg binding was seen. Thus, the initial production of small amounts of plasmin from Plg immobilized on TSP in fibrin-free microenvironments could generate a positive feedback loop by enzymatically modifying both TSP and Plg, resulting in an increase in TSP-Plg complex formation leading to the localized production of substantially more plasmin."
https://openalex.org/W1532050252,"The biochemical and kinetic properties of UDP-GlcNAc:alpha-D-mannoside (GlcNAc to Man alpha 1,3) beta 1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAc-TI) have been investigated in the Chinese hamster ovary glycosylation mutant Lec1A. Previous studies showed that, whereas Lec1A cells synthesize complex carbohydrates at levels consistent with partial GlcNAc-TI action, no GlcNAc-TI activity was detected in Lec1A cell-free extracts (Stanley, P., and Chaney, W. (1985) Mol. Cell. Biol. 5, 1204-1211). It is now reported that, under altered reaction conditions, GlcNAc-TI activity can be measured in Lec1A cell extracts. The GlcNAc-TI enzyme in Lec1A.2C has a pH optimum of 7.5 (compared with 6.25 for the parental enzyme) and apparent Km values for Man5GlcNAc2Asn and UDP-GlcNAc that are, respectively, 21- and 44-fold higher than the apparent Km values of GlcNAc-TI from parental Chinese hamster ovary cells. Two independent Lec1A mutants possess GlcNAc-TI activities with similarly altered biochemical and kinetic properties. In fact, under optimal assay conditions for each cell line, the level of GlcNAc-TI in Lec1A extracts is equal to that of parental Chinese hamster ovary cell extracts. Interestingly, the two glycosylation sites of the G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus are processed quite differently in Lec1A cells. The glycopeptide nearest the carboxyl-terminal appears to be a preferred substrate for the Lec1A GlcNAc-TI activity. The combined data suggest that the Lec1A mutation affects the gene that codes for GlcNAc-TI, giving rise to a structurally altered glycosyltransferase with different biochemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1548557192,"Bovine striatal dopamine D-2 receptor has been purified approximately 2000-fold by affinity chromatography. The receptor, solubilized with cholic acid and sodium chloride, was adsorbed on haloperidol-linked Sepharose CL-6B and eluted with spiroperidol. The adsorption of receptor to the affinity matrix was biospecific as preincubation of the solubilized preparation with D-2 receptor agonists or antagonists blocked retention of receptor. The process also displayed stereoselectivity with respect to (+)- and (-)-butaclamol. Nondopaminergic agents such as mianserin and propranolol failed to exhibit any effect on the adsorption process. Elution of the receptor was also biospecific, as dopaminergic drugs were most effective (spiroperidol greater than haloperidol greater than dopamine) in eluting the bound receptor; whereas other agents, e.g. propranolol, mianserin, and acetic acid, were only slightly effective. One-cycle affinity purification resulted in a recovery of 12% of the original membrane-bound dopamine D-2 receptor with a specific activity of 169,600 fmol/mg of protein as assayed with [3H]spiroperidol binding. The order of potency of D-2 agonists (N-propylnorapomorphine greater than NO434 greater than apomorphine greater than dopamine) and antagonists (spiroperidol greater than (+)-butaclamol greater than domperidone) with the purified preparation was found to be similar to that of the solubilized dopamine D-2 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1583315785,"A platelet membrane glycoprotein, 61 kDa, has been identified, which binds specifically to insoluble collagen. The detection of this protein was accomplished by incubating radiolabeled Triton-solubilized platelet supernatant with insoluble collagen, and, after washing the collagen pellet, extracting the 61-kDa glycoprotein from the pellet with sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer. The optimal conditions for specific binding were incubation of 120 micrograms of total platelet supernatant protein with 2 mg of collagen at 4 degrees C for 0.5 h in 0.5 ml of the incubating buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.2% Triton, pH 7.4). The 61-kDa glycoprotein is cleaved by trypsin into a major peptide (44 kDa) and a smaller peptide(s) linked together by disulfide bonds in a molecule which still binds to collagen. When intact platelets are treated first with trypsin and then with dithiothreitol, the 44-kDa peptide is released and was shown to bind to collagen. We conclude that the 61-kDa glycoprotein is a platelet membrane protein which specifically interacts through its extracellular domain with insoluble collagen, and, thus, must be considered as a possible component of the initial platelet-matrix adhesion process which leads to platelet aggregation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1585605881,"Aldosterone increases sodium absorption, short circuit current, and transmural potential difference in rat colon. We studied the rat colonic aldosterone receptor using the synthetic glucocorticoid, 11 beta, 17 beta-dihydroxy-17 alpha-propynylandrosta-1,4,6-triene-3-one, to prevent binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. Specific aldosterone binding was found in proximal and distal colon. Heating to 25 degrees C decreased binding within 15 min, but the protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, stabilized binding. Binding was highest in terminal distal colon. Competitive binding assay showed aldosterone specificity compared to other competitors was greater at 30 than at 4 degrees C, suggesting temperature-sensitive changes in receptor specificity. Scatchard analysis revealed a straight line with a KD of 2.5 nM at 0 degrees C and 4.1 nM at 30 degrees C. Bmax was higher in distal than in proximal colon (30 degrees C, 156 +/- 33 versus 65 +/- 9 fmol/mg protein) and increased by 36% in proximal and 180% in distal colon at 30 degrees C compared to 0 degrees C. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of unactivated receptor demonstrated a single peak eluting at 200-250 mM KCl. Heat, ATP, and gel filtration did not activate the receptor, whereas increasing cytosolic salt concentration to 300 mM KCl, raising the pH to 8, or adding EGTA and EDTA caused increased DNA-cellulose binding and a new peak eluting at 30-80 mM KCl on DEAE-cellulose chromatography. There is a specific aldosterone receptor in colon with increasing number of binding sites from proximal to most distal segments paralleling aldosterone's physiological effects. Absence of receptor activation with heat, gel filtration, or ATP suggests differences between activation of the aldosterone receptor and other steroid hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1968212563,"Replication of UV-irradiated oligodeoxynucleotide-primed single-stranded phi X174 DNA with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in the presence of single-stranded DNA-binding protein was investigated. The extent of initiation of replication on the primed single-stranded DNA was not altered by the presence of UV-induced lesions in the DNA. The elongation step exhibited similar kinetics when either unirradiated or UV-irradiated templates were used. Inhibition of the 3'----5' proofreading exonucleolytic activity of the polymerase by dGMP or by a mutD mutation did not increase bypass of pyrimidine photodimers, and neither did purified RecA protein influence the extent of photodimer bypass as judged by the fraction of full length DNA synthesized. Single-stranded DNA-binding protein stimulated bypass since in its absence the fraction of full length DNA decreased 5-fold. Termination of replication at putative pyrimidine dimers involved dissociation of the polymerase from the DNA, which could then reinitiate replication at other available primer templates. Based on these observations a model for SOS-induced UV mutagenesis is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1507767855,"UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:glycoprotein N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase activity has been identified in both Acanthamoeba castellani and Dictyostelium discoideum. Each of these activities exhibits a different in vitro specificity toward various purified glycoproteins. The N-acetylglucosaminyl-phosphotransferase of A. castellani is very similar to the mammalian enzyme in that it phosphorylates the lysosomal enzymes cathepsin D and uteroferrin much more efficiently than nonlysosomal glycoproteins and appears to recognize a determinant on the protein portion of these good acceptors. In contrast the D. discoideum enzyme cannot utilize cathepsin D as a good substrate and, although it phosphorylates uteroferrin efficiently, it does not recognize the protein portion of this acceptor. The oligosaccharide of uteroferrin appears to assume a different conformation than the oligosaccharides of other glycoproteins and glycopeptides, as evidenced by its enhanced sensitivity to mannosidase digestion. This conformation, presumably induced by some interaction with the underlying protein, may be responsible for the specific phosphorylation of uteroferrin by the N-acetylglucosaminylphosphotransferase of D. discoideum."
https://openalex.org/W1490126140,"The apparent molecular weight of functional protein S in citrated plasma was observed to be between 115,000 and 130,000 as measured by sedimentation equilibrium in the air-driven ultracentrifuge. The molecular weight of the functional protein decreased to approximately 62,000 when copper ions were added to the plasma. This suggested the presence of a protein S-binding protein in plasma, which was confirmed by gel filtration experiments. Frontal analysis of plasma indicated that functional protein S could exist in as many as three forms. Addition of copper ions to plasma reduced the number of forms to one. In order to isolate the binding protein, plasma was fractionated first on a column of immobilized iminodiacetic acid that had been equilibrated with copper ions. The proteins that eluted in a 0.6 M NaCl wash were passed over a column of protein S immobilized on agarose beads. A protein, eluted in the 0.6 M NaCl wash, was observed to bind to protein S in gel filtration experiments. When added to plasma depleted of both protein S and the binding protein, the binding protein was observed to enhance the anticoagulant activity of activated protein C only in the presence of protein S. Protein S-binding protein was also observed to enhance the rate of factor Va inactivation by activated protein C and protein S."
https://openalex.org/W1499530101,"The effect of hydrostatic pressure on the self-association of sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase solubilized by nonionic detergent was studied in the pressure range of 1 atm up to 2 kilobars. Polarization of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence or of fluorescence of a pyrene probe covalently attached to the ATPase was measured. An increase in hydrostatic pressure promoted dissociation of the protein into monomers. For a midpoint dissociation pressure of 1.3 kilobars, the standard volume change in the dissociation reaction was delta Vop = -167 ml/mol. Full reversibility of the pressure effects was shown to occur, as seen by recovery of polarization. An increase in Ca2+ concentration from 50 microM to 5 mM and of pH from 6.9 to 8.6 were found to increase the midpoint dissociation pressure, indicating that these factors stabilize the dimeric state. The hydrolytic activity of the ATPase was measured under pressure. The activity was inhibited by pressure increase. It was found that an irreversible inactivation of the solubilized enzyme occurred during turnover and that increasing pressure added to this instability. Reversibility of the activity was critically dependent on the presence of 10 mM Ca2+ in the assay medium."
https://openalex.org/W1483594884,"Atrial natriuretic peptides refer to a family of related peptides secreted by atria that appear to have an important role in the control of blood pressure. The structure of these peptides shows the amino acid sequence Arg101-Arg102-Ser103-Ser104, which is a typical recognition sequence (Arg-Arg-X-Ser) for phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. With this background, we tested two synthetic atrial natriuretic peptides (Arg101-Tyr126 and Gly96-Tyr126) as substrates for in vitro phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The tested atrial natriuretic peptides were found to be substrates for the reaction. Sequence studies demonstrated that the site of phosphorylation was located, as expected, at Ser104. Kinetic studies demonstrate that both atrial natriuretic peptides are excellent substrates for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. In particular, the longer peptide Gly96-Tyr126 exhibited an apparent Km value of about 0.5 microM, to our knowledge the lowest reported Km for a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase substrate. Preliminary studies to measure the biological activity of the in vitro phosphorylated atrial peptides indicate that these compounds are more effective than the corresponding dephospho forms in stimulating Na/K/Cl cotransport in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1592862284,"We have measured the uptake of arginine into vacuolar membrane vesicles from Neurospora crassa. Arginine transport was found to be dependent on ATP hydrolysis, Mg2+, time, and vesicle protein with transported arginine remaining unmodified after entry into the vesicles. The Mg2+ concentration required for optimal arginine transport varied with the ATP concentration so that maximal transport occurred when the MgATP2- concentration was at a maximum and the concentrations of free ATP and Mg2+ were at a minimum. Arginine transport exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics when the arginine concentration was varied (Km = 0.4 mM). In contrast, arginine transport did not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics when the MgATP2-concentration was varied (S0.5 = 0.12 mM). There was no inhibition of arginine transport when glutamine, ornithine, or lysine were included in the assay mixture. In contrast, arginine transport was inhibited 43% when D-arginine was present at a concentration 16-fold higher than that of L-arginine. Measurements of the internal vesicle volume established that arginine is concentrated 14-fold relative to the external concentration. Arginine transport was inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone, and potassium nitrate (an inhibitor of vacuolar ATPase activity). Inhibitors of the plasma membrane or mitochondrial ATPase such as sodium vanadate or sodium azide did not affect arginine transport activity. In addition, arginine transport had a nucleoside triphosphate specificity similar to that of the vacuolar ATPase. These results suggest that arginine transport is dependent on vacuolar ATPase activity and an intact proton channel and proton gradient."
https://openalex.org/W57903268,"Phosphorylation of the 20,000-Da light chains, LC20, of vertebrate smooth muscle myosins is thought to be the primary mechanism for regulating the actin-activated ATPase activities of these myosins and consequently smooth muscle contraction. While actin stimulates the MgATPase activities of phosphorylated smooth muscle myosins, it is generally believed that the MgATPase activities of the unphosphorylated myosins are not stimulated by actin. However, under conditions where both unphosphorylated (5% phosphorylated LC20) and phosphorylated calf aorta myosins are mostly filamentous, the maximum rate, Vmax, of the actin-activated ATPase of the unphosphorylated myosin is one-half that of the phosphorylated myosin. While LC20 phosphorylation causes only a modest increase in Vmax, in the presence of tropomyosin, this phosphorylation does cause up to a 10-fold decrease in Kapp, the actin concentration required to achieve 1/2 Vmax. In the presence of low concentrations of tropomyosin/actin, a linear relationship is obtained between the fraction of LC20 phosphorylated and stimulation of the actin-activated ATPase. The relatively high actin-activated ATPase activity of unphosphorylated aorta myosin suggests that other proteins may be involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. In contrast to the results presented here for aorta myosin, it has been reported that actin does not activate the MgATPase activity of unphosphorylated gizzard myosin and that the actin-activated ATPase of gizzard myosin increases more slowly than LC20 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1529422375,"The binding site of IgG on human platelets was studied by the use of the cleavable heterobifunctional cross-linking agent N-succinimidyl (4-azidophenyldithio)propionate. Binding characteristics of the derivatized IgG were similar to normal IgG. Periodate-borohydride treatment of platelets also did not significantly alter their ability to bind IgG. N-Succinimidyl (4-azidophenyldithio)propionate was bound to IgG via a succinimidyl ester and then photolyzed in the presence of intact platelets. Their membrane glycoproteins were first tritiated by the periodate-borohydride method. The cross-linked product was analyzed by two dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. The non-reduced first-dimension gels were subjected to 5% 2-mercaptoethanol prior to separation in the second dimension. Such gels were then evaluated by fluorography, silver staining, and counting the radioactivity of sequential gel strips in the area of cross-linking. The protein complexes at the interface between stacking and running gel were further resolved in isoelectric focusing gels. One IgG-containing band could be identified. After reduction, the constituent proteins of the cross-linked complex were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis and subsequent immunoblotting with an antiserum against platelet membrane glycoproteins. All of these studies gave evidence of glycoprotein IIIa as the receptor of IgG. Based on the results of the different experimental approaches, we conclude that glycoprotein IIIa is the IgG receptor in human platelets."

The radioactive ligand was cross-linked to three macromolecules forming labeled complexes of apparent Mr values of 130,000, 220,000, and 320,000. Betaseron, human alpha-interferon, human interleukin 2 but not recombinant human gamma-interferon competed with the labeled ligand for binding to these putative receptor(s). Human leukocyte-produced gamma-interferon competed weakly with 125I-Betaseron for binding to Daudi cells. The Betaseron-receptor complex(es) was purified by passage through a wheat germ lectin column followed by chromatography on an anti-interferon immunosorbent column and semipreparative gel electrophoresis. The cross-linked ligand-receptor complex was shown to be highly purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate and acetic acid:urea:Triton X-100 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It can be dissociated into the labeled Betaseron (Mr = 17,000) ligand and a receptor moiety which has an apparent molecular weight of 110,000. The chromatographic behavior of the ligand-receptor complex on wheat germ lectin column suggests that the receptor is a glycoprotein. The described procedure yielded about 1 microgram of Betaseron receptor from 10(10) Daudi cells, estimated to contain a maximum of about 15 micrograms of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1874384462,"We have observed two modes each of ADP and K+ regulation of phosphoenzyme (EP) intermediates formed in the early phase of skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum hydrolysis of ATP at 20 degrees C, using, for the first time, a five-syringe quench flow apparatus for transient-state kinetic measurements. The total acid-stable EP formed for 20.5 and 116 ms in the K+ medium appears to be composed of either two monomers in rapid equilibrium, E1P in equilibrium E'1P, or a dimer of the two subunits, PE1E'1P. The ADP-sensitive E1P may form an acid-labile ADP X E1P (or ATP X E1) complex rapidly, giving ATP as a consequence of acid quenching. The ADP may also induce decomposition of the ADP-reactive E'1P. Monomeric and dimeric mechanisms are introduced to account for the hyperbolic relation between the rate constant of the ADP-induced E'1P decomposition and [ADP], consistent with the fact that the E'1P may also give ATP in the presence of ADP. As to the K+ effects, the K+, which is bound to the unphosphorylated enzyme and possibly becomes occluded during EP formation, may either facilitate the one-to-one E1P in equilibrium E'1P equilibrium or maintain the dimeric functional unit. The subsequent forward transformation of the E'1P to the ADP-insensitive K+-sensitive E'2P, possibly the rate-determining step for the catalytic cycle, is found to be K+ independent. The major effect of the K+ in the medium is its catalytic cleavage of the E'2P, which is detected as the missing EP under these conditions. When K+ is not involved in the EP formation, the forward sequential transformation E1P----E'1P----E'2P----E2P or PE1E'1P----PE'2E2P is apparent in the time range from 20.5 to 116 ms after EP formation, and the E'2P may accumulate in the K+ devoid medium and be detected as the major component of the total acid-stable EP. The Mg2+-sensitive E2P represents the EP missing in the medium containing no ADP and K+."
https://openalex.org/W1629048254,"Highly purified preparations of Xenopus transcription factor A exhibit DNA-activated ATPase (ATP phosphorylase, EC 3.6.1.3) activity, which is inhibited by affinity-purified anti-factor A antibodies but not by nonspecific gamma-globulins. This enzymatic activity copurifies with both factor A and the 7 S particle, a ribonucleoprotein complex composed of factor A and 5 S RNA in a one-to-one stoichiometric ratio. At equal concentrations of protein, factor A and the 7 S particle catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi at similar rates. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that factor A is a fairly typical ATPase with a Vmax of 1.7 nmol/min/mg of protein and a KM of 5.0 X 10(-5) M, whereas the corresponding values for the 7 S particle are 2.7 nmol/min/mg of protein and 1.4 X 10(-4) M, respectively. Besides ATP, dATP is also an effective substrate for the enzyme with a Vmax of 0.7 nmol/min/mg of protein and a KM of 3.3 X 10(-5) M in reactions catalyzed by the 7 S particle. The ATPase activity of free factor A, but not the 7 S particle, can be stimulated approximately 3-fold by the addition of pBR322 plasmid DNA. Proteolytic fragments of factor A generated by treatment of the 7 S particle with papain and trypsin retain a portion of their catalytic activity, 50 and 10%, respectively, in concert with their relative size. Radioactive ATP and dATP can be photocross-linked to factor A by UV irradiation. These radioactive substrates are also cross-linked to the papain- and trypsin-generated fragments with markedly decreased efficiencies. UV photocross-linking of non-substrate nucleotides to factor A was not detectable. These results provide evidence that the ATPase activity is intrinsic to the factor A protein which is essential for the specific initiation of 5 S RNA gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1493538625,"Myosin was isolated from amoebae of Physarum polycephalum and compared with myosin from plasmodia, another motile stage in the Physarum life cycle. Amoebal myosin contained heavy chains (Mr approximately 220,000), phosphorylatable light chains (Mr 18,000), and Ca2+-binding light chains (Mr 14,000) and possessed a two-headed long-tailed shape in electron micrographs after rotary shadow casting. In the presence of high salt concentrations, myosin ATPase activity increased in the following order: Mg-ATPase activity less than K-EDTA-ATPase activity less than Ca-ATPase activity. In the presence of low salt concentrations, Mg-ATPase activity was activated approximately 9-fold by skeletal muscle actin. This actin-activated ATPase activity was inhibited by micromolar levels of Ca2+. Amoebal myosin was indistinguishable from plasmodial myosin in ATPase activities and molecular shape. However, the heavy chain and phosphorylatable light chains of amoebal myosin could be distinguished from those of plasmodial myosin in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, peptide mapping, and immunological studies, suggesting that these are different gene products. Ca2+-binding light chains of amoebal and plasmodial myosins were found to be identical using similar criteria, supporting our hypothesis that the Ca2+-binding light chain plays a key role in the inhibition of actin-activated ATPase activity in Physarum myosins by micromolar levels of Ca2+."

When 1.9 lysyl residues were modified, the K+- and Ca2+-ATPase activities were almost completely inhibited, whereas the Mg2+-ATPase activity was increased to 180% of original activity. The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity was decreased to 30% of original activity by this modification. However, affinity of S-1 for actin in the presence of ATP was unchanged. The NBD fluorescence of the modified S-1 was quenched on addition of ATP, suggesting that ATP induced conformational changes around the NBD groups attached to S-1. Tryptic digestion of the modified S-1 revealed that the NBD groups are attached mainly to the 50-kDa peptide of S-1, more precisely the 45-kDa peptide. These results confirm the recent reports that the 50-kDa peptide of S-1 is involved in the myosin ATPase reaction (Korner, M., Thiem, N. V., Cardinaud, R., and Lacombe, G.

https://openalex.org/W1508870254,"Although low concentrations of polyethylene glycol (1-5%, w/v) are essential for growing crystals of phosphoglucomutase from ammonium sulfate solutions (at close to 50% of saturation), the observed rate constant for short-term crystal growth on a defined, microcrystalline surface is essentially independent of polyethylene glycol concentration under these conditions. But this cosolute produces a substantial increase in the observed rate constant for the dissolution process and thus a corresponding increase in the solubility of the crystalline phase. These observations can be rationalized in terms of a decrease in the thermodynamic activity of the soluble form of phosphoglucomutase at high salt due to favorable interactions with polyethylene glycol (PEG) at the protein surface, coupled with a difference in accessibility of protein surfaces in the crystalline and solution states. Surfaces with a differential exposure in these two phases likely include both groups that interact favorably with polyethylene glycol relative to water (nonpolar groups) as well as those that interact unfavorably (ionic groups), but favorable PEG-protein interactions produced on dissolution must outweigh unfavorable ones. A PEG-induced increase in protein solubility at high salt concentration is likely to be general; PEG also may affect the growth of other protein crystals at high salt concentrations as it affects phosphoglucomutase."
https://openalex.org/W1518363335,"Telomere-linked genes coding for the variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) of African trypanosomes have been difficult to clone because their flanking regions frequently lack restriction sites. Therefore, we constructed a genomic DNA library of fragments generated by digestion of purified trypanosome DNA with mung bean nuclease, an enzyme that cleaves before and after genes in Plasmodium falciparum DNA (McCutchan, T. F., Hansen, J. L., Dame, J. B., and Mullins, J. A. (1984) Science 225, 625-628). Southern hybridizations with several gene probes showed that under the appropriate conditions mung bean nuclease produces discrete trypanosome DNA fragments that are as clearly resolved on an agarose gel as restriction fragments. The majority of VSG genes are on fragments of about 1.7 kilobase pairs. To examine the sites of mung bean nuclease cleavage, the insert boundary sequences of eight recombinant clones in the library containing VSG genes were determined. In general, mung bean nuclease cleaved 300-800 base pairs in front of the VSG start codon and within 50 base pairs on either side of the termination codon. These regions also form the boundaries of VSG gene conversion events indicating that the enzyme recognizes, in part, a conformational structure rather than a specific sequence. The analyzed clones included both telomere-linked and interior basic copy VSG genes indicating that the library potentially contains all of the telomere-linked VSG genes in the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1520005276,The second tryptic digestion (TD2) of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase results in the decrease of Ca2+ transport due to uncoupling and the alteration of one of the two high affinity sites to a low affinity site. The eight amino acids adjacent to the tryptic digestion site form a torus with two carboxylic side chains of one aspartic and one glutamic acid for the fast twitch skeletal ATPase and two aspartic acids for the slow twitch/cardiac ATPase toward the inside. The eight amino acid peptides were synthesized for both forms of the ATPase and their binding characteristics were studied with luminescent Eu3+ as a Ca2+ analogue. The data indicate that the peptide binds Eu3+ with 1.0 Eu3+/peptide and strips off two water molecules. The peptide region is a candidate for the Ca2+ transport site of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase.
https://openalex.org/W1572381722,"The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of phosphorylated Acanthamoeba myosin I was previously shown to be cooperatively dependent on the myosin concentration (Albanesi, J. P., Fujisaki, H., and Korn, E. D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11174-11179). This observation was rationalized by assuming that myosin I contains a high-affinity and a low-affinity F-actin-binding site and that binding at the low-affinity site is responsible for the actin-activated ATPase activity. Therefore, enzymatic activity would correlate with the cross-linking of actin filaments by myosin I, and the cooperative increase in specific activity at high myosin:actin ratios would result from the fact that cross-linking by one myosin molecule would increase the effective F-actin concentration for neighboring myosin molecules. This model predicts that high specific activity should occur at myosin:actin ratios below that required for cooperative interactions if the actin filaments are cross-linked by catalytically inert cross-linking proteins. This prediction has been confirmed by cross-linking actin filaments with either of three gelation factors isolated from Acanthamoeba, one of which has not been previously described, or by enzymatically inactive unphosphorylated Acanthamoeba myosin I."
https://openalex.org/W1573844152,"Atrial 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity from the hearts of diabetic rats was decreased by 50%, but ventricular 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity was found not to be insulin-sensitive. This decrease in atrial 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity during diabetes was characterized by diminished levels of all three types of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase subunits. As shown by immunological titration and column chromatography, the population of native 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase isozymes in the ventricles was not measurably affected during insulin deprivation. However, the atrial isozyme population in diabetic rat heart appeared to contain, on a relative basis, higher levels of the isozymic forms containing the L-type subunit. Measurement of the levels of this subunit indicated that in diabetic atria it was less affected than the other subunits. In the ventricles, insulin deficiency did not promote significant losses of fructose-2,6-P2; but, in diabetic rats, the atrial levels of this activator were decreased by 80% and subsequently restored by insulin treatment. These data suggest that any insulin-mediated effects on ventricular 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity and resultant effects on ventricular glycolysis do not appear to be exerted through changes in enzyme concentration, but probably through changes in modulators other than fructose-2,6-P2. In contrast to the ventricles, it appears that insulin exerts its effects on atrial 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity and, in part, influences atrial glycolysis through alteration of fructose-2,6-P2 levels, enzyme concentration, and isozymic content."

Flux reverted to the uninhibited rate more quickly in feedback-resistant strains than in wild type strains upon removal of exogenous arginine. These results rule out enzyme repression as a major factor in controlling arginine biosynthesis. Feedback inhibition was shown to be independent of the size of the mycelial arginine pool or of the cytosolic arginine concentration, suggesting a role for the mitochondrial membrane in controlling the concentration of arginine at the site of inhibition--the mitochondrial matrix. The implications of these results are discussed."
