https://openalex.org/W1964105560,"With the world’s population now in excess of 7 billion, it is vital to ensure the chemical and microbiological safety of our food, while maintaining the sustainability of its production, distribution and trade. Using UN databases, here we show that the international agro-food trade network (IFTN), with nodes and edges representing countries and import-export fluxes, respectively, has evolved into a highly heterogeneous, complex supply-chain network. Seven countries form the core of the IFTN, with high values of betweenness centrality and each trading with over 77% of all the countries in the world. Graph theoretical analysis and a dynamic food flux model show that the IFTN provides a vehicle suitable for the fast distribution of potential contaminants but unsuitable for tracing their origin. In particular, we show that high values of node betweenness and vulnerability correlate well with recorded large food poisoning outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W1965835805,"Cyclotides are a large family of plant peptides that are structurally defined by their cyclic backbone and a trifecta of disulfide bonds, collectively known as the cyclic cystine knot (CCK) motif. Structurally similar cyclotides have been isolated from plants within the Rubiaceae, Violaceae, and Fabaceae families and share the CCK motif with trypsin-inhibitory knottins from a plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. Cyclotides have previously been reported to be encoded by dedicated genes or as a domain within a knottin-encoding PA1-albumin-like gene. Here we report the discovery of cyclotides and related non-cyclic peptides we called “acyclotides” from petunia of the agronomically important Solanaceae plant family. Transcripts for petunia cyclotides and acyclotides encode the shortest known cyclotide precursors. Despite having a different precursor structure, their sequences suggest that petunia cyclotides mature via the same biosynthetic route as other cyclotides. We assessed the spatial distribution of cyclotides within a petunia leaf section by MALDI imaging and observed that the major cyclotide component Phyb A was non-uniformly distributed. Dissected leaf midvein extracts contained significantly higher concentrations of this cyclotide compared with the lamina and outer margins of leaves. This is the third distinct type of cyclotide precursor, and Solanaceae is the fourth phylogenetically disparate plant family to produce these structurally conserved cyclopeptides, suggesting either convergent evolution upon the CCK structure or movement of cyclotide-encoding sequences within the plant kingdom.

Cyclotides are a family of backbone-cyclized plant peptides first discovered in Oldenlandia affinis from the Rubiaceae plant family but since found in a growing number of plants from the Violaceae, Cucurbitaceae, and Fabaceae families (1Craik D.J.

The definitive structural feature common to cyclotides is the cyclic cystine knot (CCK) 4The abbreviations used are: CCKcyclic cystine knotMSImass spectrometric imagingESTexpressed sequence tagACNacetonitrileRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsAEPasparaginyl endopeptidaseSFTIsunflower trypsin inhibitor. motif in which three disulfide bonds are entwined in a knotted conformation such that one disulfide bond is threaded through an opening bounded by two sections of the peptide backbone and the two disulfide bonds constraining them (9Saether O.

The cystine knot has been demonstrated to be the feature that confers most of their stability at high temperatures, in extremes of pH, and against proteolytic enzymes (10Colgrave M.L. Craik D.J.

Kolmar H. Chiche L. Knottin cyclization. Impact on structure and dynamics.BMC Struct. Biol. 2008; 8: 54Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The CCK motif is very tolerant to sequence variation of the non-Cys residues, as exemplified by the observation that it occurs in two cyclic trypsin inhibitors, MCoTI-I and MCoTI-II (12Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D.

The stability and tolerance to sequence substitution has led to consideration of the CCK framework as a natural combinatorial template (13Craik D.J. Cemazar M. Wang C.K. Daly N.L.

Several recent studies have demonstrated the suitability of the CCK framework as a stable drug design scaffold, exemplified by the synthesis of modified cyclotides to incorporate bioactive peptide epitopes that would otherwise have short in vivo half-lives. Examples include cyclotide-based vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) agonists (15Chan L.Y. Gunasekera S. Henriques S.T. Worth N.F. Le S.J. Clark R.J. Campbell J.H. Craik D.J. Daly N.L.

These studies highlight the potential value cyclotides have as peptide therapeutics and provide an impetus for investigating their biosynthesis in plants, potentially opening new opportunities for the expression of “designer” cyclotides with pharmaceutical traits in plants. In Rubiaceae and Violaceae plants, cyclotides are products of dedicated genes that comprise an endoplasmic reticulum signal sequence and a pro-region, followed by up to three cyclotide domains, each flanked by an N-terminal pro-domain and a C-terminal tail (18Dutton J.L.

Analysis and classification of circular proteins in CyBase.Biopolymers. 2010; 94: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported the occurrence of cyclotides in the Fabaceae plant Clitoria ternatea (20Poth A.G. Colgrave M.L. Philip R. Kerenga B. Daly N.L. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. Discovery of cyclotides in the fabaceae plant family provides new insights into the cyclization, evolution, and distribution of circular proteins.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and subsequently it was demonstrated that the Fabaceae cyclotides are encoded within a PA1b-like albumin where the cyclotide has “replaced” the first of its usual two domains (21Poth A.G. Colgrave M.L. Lyons R.E. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Discovery of an unusual biosynthetic origin for circular proteins in legumes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2011; 286: 24275-24287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Typical Fabaceae albumin-1 genes encode a PA1 pro-protein that is post-translationally cleaved to liberate PA1b (a member of the knottin family) and PA1a albumins (23Higgins T.J. Chandler P.M. Randall P.J. Spencer D. Beach L.R. Blagrove R.J. Kortt A.A. Inglis A.S. Gene structure, protein structure, and regulation of the synthesis of a sulfur-rich protein in pea seeds.J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11124-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in the C. ternatea albumin-1 gene, a cyclotide domain has replaced the PA1b knottin domain. Despite being encoded within its unusual gene architecture, Cter M, the best characterized cyclotide from C. ternatea, shares the key structural feature of a CCK motif with cyclotides derived from dedicated cyclotide genes. Interestingly, another of the isolated peptides from C. ternatea is identical in primary sequence to a previously reported cyclotide, Psyle F from Psychotria leptothyrsa from Rubiaceae (24Gerlach S.L. Burman R. Bohlin L. Mondal D. Göransson U. Isolation, characterization, and bioactivity of cyclotides from the Micronesian plant Psychotria leptothyrsa.J. Nat. Prod. 2010; 73: 1207-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although their gene expression does not appear to be dynamically regulated (25Mylne J.S. Wang C.K. van der Weerden N.L. Craik D.J. Cyclotides are a component of the innate defense of Oldenlandia affinis.Biopolymers. 2010; 94: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), cyclotides are known to be differentially expressed within a plant. In Viola hederacea, cyclotide vhr1 is specific for only root tissue (26Trabi M. Craik D.J.

Recent work has demonstrated that GFP-tagged cyclotide precursors accumulate in plant cell vacuoles (27Conlan B.F. Gillon A.D. Barbeta B.L. Anderson M.A. Subcellular targeting and biosynthesis of cyclotides in plant cells.Am. J. Bot. 2011; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported insecticidal activity in cyclotides (2Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Biosynthesis and insecticidal properties of plant cyclotides.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometric imaging (MALDI-MSI) is an analytical technique in which mass spectra are collected in a raster pattern across a tissue section to generate an average mass spectrum, which, when overlaid upon an image of the sample, can reveal the spatial distribution and relative abundances of analytes (30Caprioli R.M.

MALDI-MSI (31Chughtai K. Heeren R.M. Mass spectrometric imaging for biomedical tissue analysis.Chem.

Our discovery of cyclotides in Petunia arose from interrogating expressed sequence tag (EST) databases by tBLASTN with the Cter A peptide sequence, which yielded many matches to potential cyclotide-encoding transcripts. Here we describe the characterization of cyclotides in Petunia x hybrida following their isolation and tandem MS sequencing and report a novel architecture of their genes based upon cloning of three full-length cDNA clones and a wealth of other EST-derived sequences. The discovery of cyclotides in the Solanaceae is significant and exciting because this plant family includes many crop species, including potato and tomato, two of the largest food crops by global yield with a combined world annual production of more than 450 million tons. Given the demonstrated potent insecticidal activity of isolated cyclotides (2Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Biosynthesis and insecticidal properties of plant cyclotides.

The combination of MALDI-MSI on cyclotide expression and localization in petunia and MS analysis of leaf region extracts provided evidence of non-uniform distribution of the major cyclotide mass consistent with location in the vasculature of the leaf. A vascular location is common for small molecule (39Shroff R. Vergara F. Muck A. Svatos A. Gershenzon J.

Exploitation of Solanaceae cyclotide genes might thus allow production of novel, ultrastable therapeutics, lead to the enhancement of the staple crops as “functional foods” (44Thurnham D.I.

Previous studies investigating the expression of the cyclotide-encoding gene Oak1 from Rubiaceae in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana reported the production of mainly misprocessed peptides (27Conlan B.F.

The discovery of a cyclotide-encoding gene from the Solanaceae has great potential to improve the value of N. benthamiana as a research tool to study cyclotide processing and also to study the effects of cyclotides in plant defense. P. x hybrida seedlings were sourced from Pohlmans Nursery (Gatton, Queensland, Australia). Solid phase extraction cartridges and reverse phase HPLC columns were from Grace Vydac. All solvents and enzymes were supplied as described previously (20Poth A.G. Colgrave M.L. Philip R. Kerenga B. Daly N.L. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. Discovery of cyclotides in the fabaceae plant family provides new insights into the cyclization, evolution, and distribution of circular proteins.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). P. x hybrida plants were rinsed extensively with distilled water to remove soil prior to separation of the various plant tissues. Fresh leaf (8.0 g) and root (5.3 g) samples were lyophilized prior to ball-milling using a Retsch MM300 homogenizer in three 30-s bursts at 25 Hz. Powdered plant samples were subsequently extracted in 60% acetonitrile (ACN), 1% formic acid with vortexing and probe sonication. Crude extracts were then centrifuged in a benchtop centrifuge at 4000 × g, and the supernatants were collected and diluted with 1% formic acid to give final solvent extract concentrations of 10% ACN, 1% formic acid, and 100 g/liter or 80 g/liter wet plant weight for leaf and root materials, respectively. Crude extracts were separated on Grace C18-Max solid phase extraction cartridges. Briefly, cartridges were equilibrated following the manufacturer's instructions using six bed volumes of methanol followed by six bed volumes of 10% ACN, 1% formic acid. Crude extracts were applied to the cartridges and washed with six bed volumes of 10% ACN, 1% formic acid. Bound peptide components were eluted from the cartridges in a stepwise fashion, using increasing concentrations of ACN in 1% formic acid. Alternatively, crude extracts were subjected to preparative HPLC using a Grace Vydac C18 reverse phase HPLC column (250 × 20 mm, 300 Å, 15-μm particle size) with a linear 1%/min ACN gradient as supplied by a Shimadzu LC-2010 HPLC system. Eluent was monitored at 214 nm, and fractions were collected manually. Enzymatic digestion of reduced and alkylated cyclotides was carried out prior to tandem MS analyses as described previously (20Poth A.G. Colgrave M.L. Philip R. Kerenga B. Daly N.L. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. Discovery of cyclotides in the fabaceae plant family provides new insights into the cyclization, evolution, and distribution of circular proteins.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, cyclotides were cleaved to produce linearized fragments following reduction and alkylation to prevent reoxidation. Lyophilized crude leaf extract (1 mg) was reconstituted in 150 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) and reduced by the addition of 15 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min under nitrogen gas. To alkylate the sample, 15 μl of 250 mm iodoacetamide was added, and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The alkylated sample was digested by the addition of 20 μl of 400 ng/μl endoproteinase Glu-C (P2922, Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Each sample was quenched with 20 μl of 5% formic acid and stored at 4 °C until further analysis. Leaf and stem cryosections were applied directly to indium tin oxide-coated glass slides (Bruker) and dried in a vacuum desiccator before undergoing further washing and dehydration through submersion in cold 70% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol for 30 s, and cold 96% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol for 15 s before being returned to vacuum to dry for 20 min. Washed slides were observed under an Olympus SZX7 stereomicroscope. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix was prepared at a concentration of 7 mg/ml in 50% ACN, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid and misted onto the surface of the dried sample slides using a Bruker Daltonics ImagePrep matrix sprayer. Sample slides were clamped into a Bruker Daltonics MTP Slide Adapter II MALDI plate and analyzed using a Bruker Daltonics UltraFlex III MALDI-TOF instrument running flexImaging version 2.1 software. Spectra were collected in linear positive ion mode using a 100-μm raster across the leaf section over a mass range of 2500–5000 Da with signals of <1800 Da suppressed to remove matrix and polymer peaks. Following data analysis in flexImaging, positions on the leaf section corresponding to peaks of interest were respotted manually with two applications of the matrix solution prior to manual collection of MALDI-TOF spectra in reflectron positive ion mode using flexControl software. Localization of specific m/z values was determined over a window of ±5 Da centered on the peak maxima. MALDI-TOF analyses were conducted using an Applied Biosystems 4700 TOF-TOF Proteomics Analyzer. Samples were spotted 1:1 with matrix consisting of 5 mg/ml cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% (v/v) ACN, 1% (v/v) formic acid directly onto a stainless steel MALDI target. MALDI-TOF spectra were acquired in reflector positive operating mode with the following parameters: source voltage set at 20 kV, Grid1 voltage at 12 kV, mass range 800–5000 Da, focus mass 3000 Da, collecting 2000 shots using a random laser pattern and with a laser intensity of 5000. Spectra were externally calibrated as described previously (48Saska I. Colgrave M.L. Jones A. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. Quantitative analysis of backbone-cyclised peptides in plants.J. Chromatogr.

https://openalex.org/W2003354864,"Key synaptic proteins from the soluble SNARE (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) family, among many others, are organized at the plasma membrane of cells as clusters containing dozens to hundreds of protein copies. However, the exact membranal distribution of proteins into clusters or as single molecules, the organization of molecules inside the clusters, and the clustering mechanisms are unclear due to limitations of the imaging and analytical tools. Focusing on syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25, we implemented direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy together with quantitative clustering algorithms to demonstrate a novel approach to explore the distribution of clustered and nonclustered molecules at the membrane of PC12 cells with single-molecule precision. Direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy images reveal, for the first time, solitary syntaxin/SNAP-25 molecules and small clusters as well as larger clusters. The nonclustered syntaxin or SNAP-25 molecules are mostly concentrated in areas adjacent to their own clusters. In the clusters, the density of the molecules gradually decreases from the dense cluster core to the periphery. We further detected large clusters that contain several density gradients. This suggests that some of the clusters are formed by unification of several clusters that preserve their original organization or reorganize into a single unit. Although syntaxin and SNAP-25 share some common distributional features, their clusters differ markedly from each other. SNAP-25 clusters are significantly larger, more elliptical, and less dense. Finally, this study establishes methodological tools for the analysis of single-molecule-based super-resolution imaging data and paves the way for revealing new levels of membranal protein organization."
https://openalex.org/W2008071826,"Objective Several transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are expressed in pancreatic beta cells and have been proposed to be involved in insulin secretion. However, the endogenous ligands for these channels are far from clear. Here, we demonstrate the expression of the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) ion channel in the pancreatic beta cells and its role in insulin release. TRPA1 is an attractive candidate for inducing insulin release because it is calcium permeable and is activated by molecules that are produced during oxidative glycolysis. Methods Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western blot techniques were used to determine the expression of TRPA1 channel. Ca2+ fluorescence imaging and electrophysiology (voltage- and current-clamp) techniques were used to study the channel properties. TRPA1-mediated insulin release was determined using ELISA. Results TRPA1 is abundantly expressed in a rat pancreatic beta cell line and freshly isolated rat pancreatic beta cells, but not in pancreatic alpha cells. Activation of TRPA1 by allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PGJ2) and a novel agonist methylglyoxal (MG) induces membrane current, depolarization, and Ca2+ influx leading to generation of action potentials in a pancreatic beta cell line and primary cultured pancreatic beta cells. Activation of TRPA1 by agonists stimulates insulin release in pancreatic beta cells that can be inhibited by TRPA1 antagonists such as HC030031 or AP-18 and by RNA interference. TRPA1-mediated insulin release is also observed in conditions of voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channel blockade as well as ATP sensitive potassium (KATP) channel activation. Conclusions We propose that endogenous and exogenous ligands of TRPA1 cause Ca2+ influx and induce basal insulin release and that TRPA1-mediated depolarization acts synergistically with KATP channel blockade to facilitate insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W2102289551,"The individual movements of large numbers of people are important in many contexts, from urban planning to disease spreading. Datasets that capture human mobility are now available and many interesting features have been discovered, including the ultra-slow spatial growth of individual mobility. However, the detailed substructures and spatiotemporal flows of mobility--the sets and sequences of visited locations--have not been well studied. We show that individual mobility is dominated by small groups of frequently visited, dynamically close locations, forming primary ""habitats"" capturing typical daily activity, along with subsidiary habitats representing additional travel. These habitats do not correspond to typical contexts such as home or work. The temporal evolution of mobility within habitats, which constitutes most motion, is universal across habitats and exhibits scaling patterns both distinct from all previous observations and unpredicted by current models. The delay to enter subsidiary habitats is a primary factor in the spatiotemporal growth of human travel. Interestingly, habitats correlate with non-mobility dynamics such as communication activity, implying that habitats may influence processes such as information spreading and revealing new connections between human mobility and social networks."
https://openalex.org/W2023641180,"Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure is associated with increased mucus production and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). MUC5AC is the major inducible mucus gene in the airway. The purpose of this investigation was to elucidate the mechanisms of CS-induced activation of MUC5AC gene transcription. We observed that the region -3724/-3224 of the MUC5AC promoter is critical for CS-induced gene transcriptional activity and that this region contains two Sp1 binding sites. Using a lung-relevant model, we observed that CS increased nuclear Sp1 protein expression. Consequently, CS exposure resulted in enhanced Sp1-DNA binding activity and Sp1 trans-activation. Co-transfection of the MUC5AC-luc reporter with Sp1 expression plasmids resulted in significantly increased MUC5AC-luc activity, whereas co-treatment with mithramycin A, a Sp1 inhibitor, abolished CS-induced MUC5AC promoter activity. Using mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that two Sp1 binding sites in the MUC5AC promoter are functional and responsive to CS exposure. A mutation of either Sp1 binding site in the MUC5AC promoter significantly decreased CS-induced promoter activity. Together, these data indicate that CS induces MUC5AC gene transcription predominantly through increased Sp1 nuclear protein levels and increased Sp1 binding to its promoter region."
https://openalex.org/W2135835560,"Hereditary hyperekplexia or startle disease is characterized by an exaggerated startle response, evoked by tactile or auditory stimuli, leading to hypertonia and apnea episodes. Missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site mutations, and large deletions in the human glycine receptor α1 subunit gene (GLRA1) are the major known cause of this disorder. However, mutations are also found in the genes encoding the glycine receptor β subunit (GLRB) and the presynaptic Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent glycine transporter GlyT2 (SLC6A5). In this study, systematic DNA sequencing of SLC6A5 in 93 new unrelated human hyperekplexia patients revealed 20 sequence variants in 17 index cases presenting with homozygous or compound heterozygous recessive inheritance. Five apparently unrelated cases had the truncating mutation R439X. Genotype-phenotype analysis revealed a high rate of neonatal apneas and learning difficulties associated with SLC6A5 mutations. From the 20 SLC6A5 sequence variants, we investigated glycine uptake for 16 novel mutations, confirming that all were defective in glycine transport. Although the most common mechanism of disrupting GlyT2 function is protein truncation, new pathogenic mechanisms included splice site mutations and missense mutations affecting residues implicated in Cl(-) binding, conformational changes mediated by extracellular loop 4, and cation-π interactions. Detailed electrophysiology of mutation A275T revealed that this substitution results in a voltage-sensitive decrease in glycine transport caused by lower Na(+) affinity. This study firmly establishes the combination of missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations in the GlyT2 gene as the second major cause of startle disease."
https://openalex.org/W2140211058,"Cytochromes P450 (CYP) from the 2A subfamily are known for their roles in the metabolism of nicotine, the addictive agent in tobacco, and activation of the tobacco procarcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). Although both the hepatic CYP2A6 and respiratory CYP2A13 enzymes metabolize these compounds, CYP2A13 does so with much higher catalytic efficiency, but the structural basis for this has been unclear. X-ray structures of nicotine complexes with CYP2A13 (2.5 Å) and CYP2A6 (2.3 Å) yield a structural rationale for the preferential binding of nicotine to CYP2A13. Additional structures of CYP2A13 with NNK reveal either a single NNK molecule in the active site with orientations corresponding to metabolites known to form DNA adducts and initiate lung cancer (2.35 Å) or with two molecules of NNK bound (2.1 Å): one in the active site and one in a more distal staging site. Finally, in contrast to prior CYP2A structures with enclosed active sites, CYP2A13 conformations were solved that adopt both open and intermediate conformations resulting from an ∼2.5 Å movement of the F to G helices. This channel occurs in the same region where the second, distal NNK molecule is bound, suggesting that the channel may be used for ligand entry and/or exit from the active site. Altogether these structures provide multiple new snapshots of CYP2A13 conformations that assist in understanding the binding and activation of an important human carcinogen, as well as critical comparisons in the binding of nicotine, one of the most widely used and highly addictive drugs in human use."
https://openalex.org/W2051857414,"Translesion synthesis is a fundamental biological process that enables DNA replication across lesion sites to ensure timely duplication of genetic information at the cost of replication fidelity, and it is implicated in development of cancer drug resistance after chemotherapy. The eukaryotic Y-family polymerase Rev1 is an essential scaffolding protein in translesion synthesis. Its C-terminal domain (CTD), which interacts with translesion polymerase ζ through the Rev7 subunit and with polymerases κ, ι, and η in vertebrates through the Rev1-interacting region (RIR), is absolutely required for function. We report the first solution structures of the mouse Rev1 CTD and its complex with the Pol κ RIR, revealing an atypical four-helix bundle. Using yeast two-hybrid assays, we have identified a Rev7-binding surface centered at the α2-α3 loop and N-terminal half of α3 of the Rev1 CTD. Binding of the mouse Pol κ RIR to the Rev1 CTD induces folding of the disordered RIR peptide into a three-turn α-helix, with the helix stabilized by an N-terminal cap. RIR binding also induces folding of a disordered N-terminal loop of the Rev1 CTD into a β-hairpin that projects over the shallow α1-α2 surface and creates a deep hydrophobic cavity to interact with the essential FF residues juxtaposed on the same side of the RIR helix. Our combined structural and biochemical studies reveal two distinct surfaces of the Rev1 CTD that separately mediate the assembly of extension and insertion translesion polymerase complexes and provide a molecular framework for developing novel cancer therapeutics to inhibit translesion synthesis."

We investigated the association of CpG island methylation in candidate genes and clinicopathological features in 65 African-American (AA) and European-American (EA) breast cancer patients. Quantitative methylation analysis was carried out on bisulfite modified genomic DNA and sequencing (pyrosequencing) for promoter CpG islands of p16, ESR1, RASSF1A, RARβ2, CDH13, HIN1, SFRP1 genes and the LINE1 repetitive element using matched paired non-cancerous and breast tumor specimen (32 AA and 33 EA women). Five of the genes, all known tumor suppressor genes (RASSF1A, RARβ2, CDH13, HIN1 and SFRP1), were found to be frequently hypermethylated in breast tumor tissues but not in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Significant differences in the CDH13 methylation status were observed by comparing DNA methylation between AA and EA patients, with more obvious CDH13 methylation differences between the two patient groups in the ER- disease and among young patients (age<50). In addition, we observed associations between CDH13, SFRP1, and RASSF1A methylation and breast cancer subtypes and between SFRP1 methylation and patient's age. Furthermore, tumors that received neoadjuvant therapy tended to have reduced RASSF1A methylation when compared with chemotherapy naïve tumors. Finally, Kaplan Meier survival analysis showed a significant association between methylation at 3 loci (RASSF1A, RARβ2 and CDH13) and reduced overall disease survival. In conclusion, the DNA methylation status of breast tumors was found to be significantly associated with clinicopathological features and race/ethnicity of the patients."
https://openalex.org/W2038452110,"Mutations in the WNK1 gene, encoding a serine-threonine kinase of the WNK (With No lysine (K)) family, have been implicated in two rare human diseases, Familial Hyperkalemic Hypertension (FHHt) and Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type 2 (HSAN2). Alternative promoters give rise to a ubiquitous isoform, L-WNK1, and a kidney-specific isoform, KS-WNK1. Several other isoforms are generated through alternative splicing of exons 9, 11 and 12 but their precise tissue distribution is not known. Two additional exons, 8b and HSN2, involved in HSAN2, are thought to be specifically expressed in the nervous system. The purpose of this study was to establish an exhaustive description of all WNK1 isoforms and to quantify their relative level of expression in a panel of human and mouse tissues and in mouse nephron segments. For the latter purpose, we developed a new methodology allowing the determination of the proportions of the different isoforms generated by alternative splicing. Our results evidenced a striking tissue-specific distribution of the different isoforms and the unexpected presence of exon HSN2 in many tissues other than the nervous system. We also found exon 26 to be alternatively spliced in human and identified two new exons, 26a and 26b, within intron 26, specifically expressed in nervous tissues both in humans and mice. WNK1 should therefore no longer be designated as a 28- but as a 32-exon gene, with 8 of them - 8b, HSN2, 9, 11, 12, 26, 26a and 26b - alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific manner. These tissue-specific isoforms must be considered when studying the different roles of this ubiquitous kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2063055942,"Quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) are used to monitor relative changes in very small amounts of DNA. One drawback to qPCR is reproducibility: measuring the same sample multiple times can yield data that is so noisy that important differences can be dismissed. Numerous analytical methods have been employed that can extract the relative template abundance between samples. However, each method is sensitive to baseline assignment and to the unique shape profiles of individual reactions, which gives rise to increased variance stemming from the analytical procedure itself.We developed a simple mathematical model that accurately describes the entire PCR reaction profile using only two reaction variables that depict the maximum capacity of the reaction and feedback inhibition. This model allows quantification that is more accurate than existing methods and takes advantage of the brighter fluorescence signals from later cycles. Because the model describes the entire reaction, the influences of baseline adjustment errors, reaction efficiencies, template abundance, and signal loss per cycle could be formalized. We determined that the common cycle-threshold method of data analysis introduces unnecessary variance because of inappropriate baseline adjustments, a dynamic reaction efficiency, and also a reliance on data with a low signal-to-noise ratio.Using our model, fits to raw data can be used to determine template abundance with high precision, even when the data contains baseline and signal loss defects. This improvement reduces the time and cost associated with qPCR and should be applicable in a variety of academic, clinical, and biotechnological settings."

https://openalex.org/W2000188558,"Protein folding is the primary role of proteostasis network (PN) where chaperone interactions with client proteins determine the success or failure of the folding reaction in the cell. We now address how the Phe508 deletion in the NBD1 domain of the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) impacts the binding of CFTR with cellular chaperones. We applied single ion reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS) to quantitatively characterize the stoichiometry of the heat shock proteins (Hsps) in CFTR folding intermediates in vivo and mapped the sites of interaction of the NBD1 domain of CFTR with Hsp90 in vitro. Unlike folding of WT-CFTR, we now demonstrate the presence of ΔF508-CFTR in a stalled folding intermediate in stoichiometric association with the core Hsps 40, 70 and 90, referred to as a 'chaperone trap'. Culturing cells at 30 C resulted in correction of ΔF508-CFTR trafficking and function, restoring the sub-stoichiometric association of core Hsps observed for WT-CFTR. These results support the interpretation that ΔF508-CFTR is restricted to a chaperone-bound folding intermediate, a state that may contribute to its loss of trafficking and increased targeting for degradation. We propose that stalled folding intermediates could define a critical proteostasis pathway branch-point(s) responsible for the loss of function in misfolding diseases as observed in CF."

Initially, the SUMO and ubiquitin pathways were viewed as having a largely antagonistic relationship by competing for overlapping target site residues (14Gill G.

However, recent studies reveal that sumoylated substrates can be targeted to the ubiquitin system by a family of RING finger ubiquitin ligases, known as SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbL proteins), promoting target protein degradation by the 26 S proteasome (16Prudden J.

However, the mechanistic basis for control of the transcriptional regulatory activity of Bcl11b is largely unknown. Signaling cascades initiated by T-cell receptor (TCR) activation direct the reprogramming of the gene expression network in progenitor cells that drives T-cell differentiation and maturation toward the mature, SP phenotypes (37Rothenberg E.V.

We hypothesized that Bcl11b may be regulated by PTMs in the context of T-cell signaling events. To test this hypothesis, we adapted a previously described in vitro system that was shown to serve as a surrogate for TCR activation (44Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Tozawa Y. Zhao Y. Mukai M. Motegi Y.

Phorbol ester and calcium ionophore can replace TCR signals that induce positive selection of CD4 T cells.J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1508-1513PubMed Google Scholar). Data presented herein suggest that the MAP kinase pathways dynamically regulate the PTM status of Bcl11b; treatment with a phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore resulted in the sequential and rapid phosphorylation, desumoylation, dephosphorylation, resumoylation, ubiquitination, and ultimately degradation of Bcl11b. Furthermore and importantly, these PTMs modified the transcriptional regulatory activity of Bcl11b on a natural transcriptional target, the mouse Id2 promoter. Our findings strongly suggest that Bcl11b is a highly regulated node in MAP kinase pathways, linking TCR activation to altered gene expression programs that are required to initiate the SP differentiation program in DP thymocytes. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanistic basis for and the molecular consequences of cell signaling-dependent modification of Bcl11b by PTMs. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (P1269) PDBu and anti-FLAG antibody (F4042) were purchased from Sigma.

https://openalex.org/W1967534579,"Introduction Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using field strengths up to 3 Tesla (T) has proven to be a powerful tool for stroke diagnosis. Recently, ultrahigh-field (UHF) MRI at 7 T has shown relevant diagnostic benefits in imaging of neurological diseases, but its value for stroke imaging has not been investigated yet. We present the first evaluation of a clinically feasible stroke imaging protocol at 7 T. For comparison an established stroke imaging protocol was applied at 3 T. Methods In a prospective imaging study seven patients with subacute and chronic stroke were included. Imaging at 3 T was immediately followed by 7 T imaging. Both protocols included T1-weighted 3D Magnetization-Prepared Rapid-Acquired Gradient-Echo (3D-MPRAGE), T2-weighted 2D Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (2D-FLAIR), T2-weighted 2D Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (2D-T2-TSE), T2* weighted 2D Fast Low Angle Shot Gradient Echo (2D-HemoFLASH) and 3D Time-of-Flight angiography (3D-TOF). Results The diagnostic information relevant for clinical stroke imaging obtained at 3 T was equally available at 7 T. Higher spatial resolution at 7 T revealed more anatomical details precisely depicting ischemic lesions and periinfarct alterations. A clear benefit in anatomical resolution was also demonstrated for vessel imaging at 7 T. RF power deposition constraints induced scan time prolongation and reduced brain coverage for 2D-FLAIR, 2D-T2-TSE and 3D-TOF at 7 T versus 3 T. Conclusions The potential of 7 T MRI for human stroke imaging is shown. Our pilot study encourages a further evaluation of the diagnostic benefit of stroke imaging at 7 T in a larger study."
https://openalex.org/W2056963346,"The human selenoprotein VIMP (VCP-interacting membrane protein)/SelS (selenoprotein S) localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and is involved in the process of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). To date, little is known about the presumed redox activity of VIMP, its structure and how these features might relate to the function of the protein in ERAD. Here, we use the recombinantly expressed cytosolic region of VIMP where the selenocysteine (Sec) in position 188 is replaced with a cysteine (a construct named cVIMP-Cys) to characterize redox and structural properties of the protein. We show that Cys-188 in cVIMP-Cys forms a disulfide bond with Cys-174, consistent with the presence of a Cys174-Sec188 selenosulfide bond in the native sequence. For the disulfide bond in cVIMP-Cys we determined the reduction potential to -200 mV, and showed it to be a good substrate of thioredoxin. Based on a biochemical and structural characterization of cVIMP-Cys using analytical gel filtration, CD and NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with bioinformatics, we propose a comprehensive overall structural model for the cytosolic region of VIMP. The data clearly indicate the N-terminal half to be comprised of two extended α-helices followed by a C-terminal region that is intrinsically disordered. Redox-dependent conformational changes in cVIMP-Cys were observed only in the vicinity of the two Cys residues. Overall, the redox properties observed for cVIMP-Cys are compatible with a function as a reductase, and we speculate that the plasticity of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal region allows the protein to access many different and structurally diverse substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2095140787,"Background High coverage of personal protection measures that kill mosquitoes dramatically reduce malaria transmission where vector populations depend upon human blood. However, most primary malaria vectors outside of sub-Saharan Africa can be classified as “very zoophagic,” meaning they feed occasionally (<10% of blood meals) upon humans, so personal protection interventions have negligible impact upon their survival. Methods and Findings We extended a published malaria transmission model to examine the relationship between transmission, control, and the baseline proportion of bloodmeals obtained from humans (human blood index). The lower limit of the human blood index enables derivation of simplified models for zoophagic vectors that (1) Rely on only three field-measurable parameters. (2) Predict immediate and delayed (with and without assuming reduced human infectivity, respectively) impacts of personal protection measures upon transmission. (3) Illustrate how appreciable indirect communal-level protection for non-users can be accrued through direct personal protection of users. (4) Suggest the coverage and efficacy thresholds required to attain epidemiological impact. The findings suggest that immediate, indirect, community-wide protection of users and non-users alike may linearly relate to the efficacy of a user’s direct personal protection, regardless of whether that is achieved by killing or repelling mosquitoes. High protective coverage and efficacy (≥80%) are important to achieve epidemiologically meaningful impact. Non-users are indirectly protected because the two most common species of human malaria are strict anthroponoses. Therefore, the small proportion of mosquitoes that are killed or diverted while attacking humans can represent a large proportion of those actually transmitting malaria. Conclusions Simplified models of malaria transmission by very zoophagic vectors may be used by control practitioners to predict intervention impact interventions using three field-measurable parameters; the proportion of human exposure to mosquitoes occurring when an intervention can be practically used, its protective efficacy when used, and the proportion of people using it."
https://openalex.org/W2133505212,"Recently, it was identified that Pseudomonas aeruginosa competes with rival cells to gain a growth advantage using a novel mechanism that includes two interrelated processes as follows: employing type VI secretion system (T6SS) virulence effectors to lyse other bacteria, and at the same time producing specialized immunity proteins to inactivate their cognate effectors for self-protection against mutual toxicity. To explore the structural basis of these processes in the context of functional performance, the crystal structures of the T6SS virulence effector Tse1 and its complex with the corresponding immunity protein Tsi1 were determined, which, in association with mutagenesis and Biacore analyses, provided a molecular platform to resolve the relevant structural questions. The results indicated that Tse1 features a papain-like structure and conserved catalytic site with distinct substrate-binding sites to hydrolyze its murein peptide substrate. The immunity protein Tsi1 interacts with Tse1 via a unique interactive recognition mode to shield Tse1 from its physiological substrate. These findings reveal both the structural mechanisms for bacteriolysis and the self-protection against the T6SS effector Tse1. These mechanisms are significant not only by contributing to a novel understanding of niche competition among bacteria but also in providing a structural basis for antibacterial agent design and the development of new strategies to fight P. aeruginosa.

Competitions for survival occur everywhere between living beings. Niche competition among bacteria in natural environments is fierce and often influences the pathogenesis and progress of certain human diseases during polymicrobial infections (1Reid G. Howard J.

It is now known that T6SS is a specialized protein secretory apparatus evolved by Gram-negative bacteria to deliver effector proteins into target cells in a cell contact-dependent manner. Two conserved T6SS components, hemolysin co-regulated protein and valine-glycine repeat protein G, have been structurally characterized and have remarkable homology to bacteriophage tail proteins (10Mougous J.D.

These findings prompt the speculation that T6SS may assemble as an inverted phage tail across the envelope of bacteria, targeting bacterial cells by a puncturing manner analogous to bacteriophage entry (13Kanamaru S. Leiman P.G. Kostyuchenko V.A. Chipman P.R. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Arisaka F. Rossmann M.G.

However, the mechanism underlying effector delivery through this secretory apparatus and the functions of the effectors in recipient cells remain unclear. Most recently, it was demonstrated that the hemolysin co-regulated protein secretion island I-encoded T6SS (H1-T6SS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa plays an important role in P. aeruginosa competition with other Gram-negative bacteria (15Hood R.D. Singh P. Hsu F. Güvener T. Carl M.A. Trinidad R.R. Silverman J.M. Ohlson B.B. Hicks K.G. Plemel R.L. Li M. Schwarz S. Wang W.Y. Merz A.J. Goodlett D.R. Mougous J.D.

The system delivers two novel effector proteins, Tse1 and Tse3, into target bacterial cells, which breach the barrier of the Gram-negative outer membrane by virtue of the T6SS and act as lytic enzymes that hydrolyze the murein in the periplasm of recipient cells (16Russell A.B. Hood R.D. Bui N.K. LeRoux M. Vollmer W. Mougous J.D. Type VI secretion delivers bacteriolytic effectors to target cells.Nature. 2011; 475: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Interestingly, P. aeruginosa cannot distinguish between its siblings and other bacteria, and thus the bacteria export these effectors into each other through the T6SS. To protect against mutual toxicity, P. aeruginosa produces two immunity proteins (Tsi1 and Tsi3) that specifically inactivate their cognate effectors (16Russell A.B. Hood R.D. Bui N.K. LeRoux M. Vollmer W. Mougous J.D. Type VI secretion delivers bacteriolytic effectors to target cells.Nature. 2011; 475: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). These findings indicate an ingenious bacterial niche competition strategy. Exploring the molecular mechanism of this strategy using a three-dimensional structural basis of the effectors and their specific immune proteins is of great significance for understanding interbacterial competitive interactions, and it also provides a potential application value in the development of effective antibacterial agents and approaches. Tse1 has been functionally characterized as a dl-endopeptidase that specifically hydrolyzes the γ-d-glutamyl-l-meso-diaminopimelic acid (γ-d-glutamyl-DAP) linkage in the murein peptide bridge (16Russell A.B. Hood R.D. Bui N.K. LeRoux M. Vollmer W. Mougous J.D. Type VI secretion delivers bacteriolytic effectors to target cells.Nature. 2011; 475: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism for the recognition and cleaving of the murein peptide substrate by Tse1 has remained elusive because of the low primary sequence homology with known dl-endopeptidases and the lack of a solved structure for this T6SS effector. The immunity protein Tsi1, which is only detected in P. aeruginosa, also bears no significant sequence homology to characterized proteins. Therefore, the question of how Tsi1 specifically inactivates Tse1 to protect P. aeruginosa against mutual toxicity has remained open. In this study, we report on the crystal structures of Tse1 and its complex with Tsi1. These findings build a structural framework for the understanding of the bacteriolysis mechanisms underlying the T6SS effectors and self-protection via corresponding immunity proteins. In addition, these findings provide a structural basis for antibacterial agent design and the development of new strategies to fight P. aeruginosa. The gene sequences encoding the full-length Tse1 and truncated Tsi1 without the N-terminal 19-residue signal peptide were synthesized with proper optimization to reduce the high GC contents (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). Then both genes were subcloned into a pET-28a vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) between the NdeI and XhoI sites, which resulted in an N-terminal fusion sequence (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM). The mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the wild-type (WT) vector as the template and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) grown in LB medium and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 289 K. Bacterial pellets were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g and then resuspended in lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, and 10 mm imidazole) with 0.1 mm PMSF and lysed by sonication in an ice bath. After centrifugation, the soluble proteins were first purified using Ni2+-resin (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and then diluted with buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1% v/v glycerol), followed by a thrombin digestion of the His6 tag. A second nickel chromatography step was performed, and the flow-through proteins were collected and concentrated. Tse1 was further purified by cation-exchange (HiTrap SP HP column, GE Healthcare) and gel filtration (Hiload 16/60 Superdex 75 column, GE Healthcare) chromatography. Selenomethionine-substituted (SeMet) Tse1 was produced by expression in the E. coli methionine auxotrophic strain B834 (DE3). The purification procedure for the SeMet derivative was the same as that of the native protein. Tsi1 was further purified by anion-exchange (HiTrap Q HP column, GE Healthcare) and gel filtration (Hiload 16/60 Superdex 75 column, GE Healthcare) chromatography. All the Tsi1 mutants were expressed and purified using the same protocol. The Tse1-Tsi1 complex was obtained by mixing two proteins with excess Tse1 followed by gel filtration (Hiload 16/60 Superdex 75 column, GE Healthcare) chromatography. All purified proteins were stored in buffer A (5 mm dithiothreitol and 0.2 mm EDTA added for the SeMet protein) at 193 K. The crystallization experiments were performed using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K with 2-μl drops containing a 1-μl protein solution and 1-μl reservoir solution equilibrated over a 0.5-ml reservoir solution. Initial crystallization hits were found using an Index Kit (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). The Tse1 crystals and SeMet-labeled Tse1 were grown in 1.8 m sodium formate and 50 mm MES, pH 6.2. The Tse1-Tsi1 complex crystals were grown from a solution of 20% (v/v) PEG4000, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.4, and 20% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol. The single wavelength anomalous diffraction data set for SeMet-labeled Tse1 was collected at beamline 3W1A of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Beijing, China). The high resolution data set of Tse1 and the Tse1-Tsi1 complex data set were collected at beamline 17A of the Photon Factory (KEK, Tsukuba, Japan). Prior to data collection, all of the crystals were transferred to a well solution supplied with 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. All the data sets were processed with MOSFLM and scaled with SCALA from the CCP4 program suite (17Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 The CCP4 suite. Programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). Phase determination and automatic model building of Tse1 were performed with PHENIX (18Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C.

Model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar). The refinement was carried out with PHENIX. The structure of the Tse1-Tsi1 complex was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER of the CCP4 program suite using the apo-Tse1 structure as a search model. Model building and structural refinement were performed with COOT and PHENIX, respectively. The statistics of data collection and refinement are summarized in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab The tse1 gene was also subcloned into a pET-22b vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) between the NcoI and XhoI sites for expression in the periplasm by fusion with an N-terminal signal peptide. The vector also added a C-terminal hexahistidine tag to the expressed protein, allowing for Western blot analysis of expression. The catalytic residue mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the WT-Tse1 as the template. BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells harboring WT-Tse1 expression plasmids and mutant Tse1 were grown overnight in LB medium at 310 K and subinoculated to a starting absorbance of ∼0.06 at 600 nm (A600) in LB medium. The cultures were grown to an A600 0.26–0.27 and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The A600 values of the cultures were recorded for growth curves. Protein expression levels were detected at 40 min after induction by Western blot analysis against the anti-His antibody (Abmart, Shanghai, China) and the anti-β-lactamase antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Protein kinetics were investigated using a surface plasmon resonance Biacore T100 machine (GE Healthcare) at 298 K. The running buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20) was prepared, vacuum filtered, and degassed immediately prior to use. One CM5 sensor chip flow cell was activated for 7 min with a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.1 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Tse1, at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate pH 5.0, was immobilized to 300 response units on the flow cell. The remaining binding sites were blocked by 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The WT-Tsi1 and mutant Tsi1 proteins were injected at different concentrations over the Tse1 surface and blank flow cell for 2 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. After 2–4 min at dissociation phase, the bound protein was removed with a 30-s wash with 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.0. The resulting data were analyzed with Biacore T100 evaluation software by fitting to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Although Tse1 has been defined as a novel dl-endopeptidase that belongs to the superfamily of papain-like cysteine peptidases, determining the structure of Tse1 with available structures of other dl-endopeptidases as search models was unsuccessful. We solved the crystal structure of apo-Tse1 by selenium single-wavelength anomalous diffraction at a −1.5-Å resolution. The structure of apo-Tse1 contains one Tse1 molecule in an asymmetric unit, which is consistent with the observation that Tse1 exists as a monomer in solution (Fig. 1A). The final model includes residues 3–154 of Tse1. The first two residues are not included in the final model due to the lack of interpretable electron density. The details of the crystallographic analysis are summarized in Table 1. Tse1 adopts a compact papain-like α+β fold that consists of six β-strands (β1-β6) and five helices (α1-α5). The six β-strands constitute a curved antiparallel β-sheet in the center of the structure, and the five helices flank each side of the central β-sheet (Fig. 1B). Following the last β6 is a long flexible loop that is fixed by a disulfide bond between Cys-148 within the loop and Cys-7 located at the N terminus of α1 (Fig. 1B). Extensive side-chain hydrophobic interactions play important roles in maintaining the integrated structure. Structural homology searches by DALI (23Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server. Conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar) reveal that Tse1 shares a notable structural similarity with characterized NlpC/P60 domains of other dl-endopeptidases. The significant hits retrieved by DALI include dl-endopeptidase YkfC from Bacillus cereus (Z = 10.0, PDB code 3H41) (24Xu Q. Abdubek P. Astakhova T. Axelrod H.L. Bakolitsa C. Cai X. Carlton D.

Structural comparisons between Tse1 and the NlpC/P60 domains of these dl-endopeptidases yield a moderate root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 2.7–3.8 Å for 112 aligned Cα atoms, indicative of notable differences between them, particularly in the flexible loop connecting the conserved second structure elements. As a branch of papain-like cysteine peptidases widespread in bacteria, NlpC/P60 dl-endopeptidases possess the highly conserved catalytic triad Cys-His-Xaa (where Xaa is a polar residue) in which the catalytic Cys-His pair hydrolyzes the substrate and the third polar residue orients the second His to the first Cys (29Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Evolutionary history, structural features, and biochemical diversity of the NlpC/P60 superfamily of enzymes.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence alignment indicates that despite bearing a low sequence homology with other NlpC/P60 dl-endopeptidases, Tse1 retains the crucial catalytic Cys-His pair (supplemental Fig. 1). In the apo-Tse1 structure, the reactive Cys-30 is located in the N terminus of α2, spatially adjacent to the catalytic His-91 located on the N terminus of β3. Both catalytic residues could be well superimposed to their corresponding counterparts in other NlpC/P60 dl-endopeptidases (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W2088338179,"The bacterial multidrug transporter EmrE is a dual-topology membrane protein and as such is able to insert into the membrane in two opposite orientations. The functional form of EmrE is a homodimer; however, the relative orientation of the subunits in the dimer is under debate. Using EmrE variants with fixed, opposite orientations in the membrane, we now show that, although the proteins are able to form parallel dimers, an antiparallel organization of the subunits in the dimer is preferred. Blue-native PAGE analyses of intact oligomers and disulfide cross-linking demonstrate that in membranes, the proteins form parallel dimers only if no oppositely orientated partner is present. Co-expression of oppositely orientated proteins almost exclusively yields antiparallel dimers. Finally, parallel dimers can be disrupted and converted into antiparallel dimers by heating of detergent-solubilized protein. Importantly, in vivo function is correlated clearly to the presence of antiparallel dimers. Our results suggest that an antiparallel arrangement of the subunits in the dimer is more stable than a parallel organization and likely corresponds to the functional form of the protein."

We have previously demonstrated that a withanolide, tubocapsenolide A, induced cycle arrest and apoptosis in human breast cancer cells, which was associated with the inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). To investigate whether other withanolides are also capable of inhibiting Hsp90 and to analyze the structure-activity relationships, nine withanolides with different structural properties were tested in human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 in the present study. Our data show that the 2,3-unsaturated double bond-containing withanolides inhibited Hsp90 function, as evidenced by selective depletion of Hsp90 client proteins and induction of Hsp70. The inhibitory effect of the withanolides on Hsp90 chaperone activity was further confirmed using in vivo heat shock luciferase activity recovery assays. Importantly, Hsp90 inhibition by the withanolides was correlated with their ability to induce cancer cell death. In addition, the withanolides reduced constitutive NF-κB activation by depleting IκB kinase complex (IKK) through inhibition of Hsp90. In estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells, the withanolides also reduced the expression of ER, and this may be partly due to Hsp90 inhibition. Taken together, our results suggest that Hsp90 inhibition is a general feature of cytotoxic withanolides and plays an important role in their anticancer activity."
https://openalex.org/W2085622333,"Plant cyclotides are the largest family of gene-encoded cyclic proteins. They act as host defense molecules to protect plants and are promising candidates as insecticidal and nematocidal agents in agriculture. For this promise to be realized a greater understanding of the post-translational processing of these proteins is needed. Cyclotides are cleaved from precursor proteins with subsequent ligation of the N and C termini to form a continuous peptide backbone. This cyclization step is inefficient in transgenic plants and our work aims to shed light on the specificity requirements at the excision sites for cyclic peptide production. Using the prototypic cyclotide kalata B1 (kB1) expressed from the Oak1 gene, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to examine the cyclization efficiency when mutants of the Oak1 gene were expressed in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana. Cleavage at the N terminus of the cyclotide domain occurs rapidly with no strict specificity requirements for amino acids at the cleavage site. In contrast, the C-terminal region of the cyclotide domain in the P2, P1, P1', and P2' positions is highly conserved and only specific amino acids can occupy these positions. The cyclization reaction requires an Asn at position P1 followed by a small amino acid (Ala, Gly, Ser) at the P1' position. The P2' position must be filled by Leu or Ile; in their absence an unusual post-translational modification occurs. Substitution of the P2' Leu with Ala leads to hydroxylation of the neighboring proline. Through mutational analysis this novel proline hydroxylation motif was determined to be Gly-Ala-Pro-Ser."

Artemisinin resistance has recently been confirmed in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and efforts for surveillance and containment are intensified. To determine potential mechanisms of artemisinin resistance and monitor the emergence and spread of resistance in other regions of the GMS, we investigated the in vitro sensitivity of 51 culture-adapted parasite isolates from the China-Myanmar border area to four drugs. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of dihydroartemisinin, mefloquine and lumefantrine were clustered in a relatively narrow, 3- to 6-fold range, whereas the IC50 range of artesunate was 12-fold. We assessed the polymorphisms of candidate resistance genes pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfATP6, pfmdr6 and pfMT (a putative metabolite/drug transporter). The K76T mutation in pfcrt reached fixation in the study parasite population, whereas point mutations in pfmdr1 and pfATP6 had low levels of prevalence. In addition, pfmdr1 gene amplification was not detected. None of the mutations in pfmdr1 and pfATP6 was associated significantly with in vitro sensitivity to artemisinin derivatives. The ABC transporter gene pfmdr6 harbored two point mutations, two indels, and number variations in three simple repeats. Only the length variation in a microsatellite repeat appeared associated with altered sensitivity to dihydroartemisinin. The PfMT gene had two point mutations and one codon deletion; the I30N and N496– both reached high levels of prevalence. However, none of the SNPs or haplotypes in PfMT were correlated significantly with resistance to the four tested drugs. Compared with other parasite populations from the GMS, our studies revealed drastically different genotype and drug sensitivity profiles in parasites from the China-Myanmar border area, where artemisinins have been deployed extensively for over 30 years."

https://openalex.org/W2032737825,"Metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) is widely overexpressed in human cancers and is associated with malignant phenotypic changes contributing to morbidity in the associated diseases. Here we discovered for the first time that MTA1, a master chromatin modifier, transcriptionally represses the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a tumor suppressor gene, by recruiting class II histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) along with the transcription factor Yin-Yang 1 (YY1) onto the PTEN promoter. We also found evidence of an inverse correlation between the expression levels of MTA1 and PTEN in physiologically relevant breast cancer microarray datasets. We found that MTA1 up-regulation leads to a decreased expression of PTEN protein and stimulation of PI3K as well as phosphorylation of its signaling targets. Accordingly, selective down-regulation of MTA1 in breast cancer cells increases PTEN expression and inhibits stimulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling. Collectively, these findings provide a mechanistic role for MTA1 in transcriptional repression of PTEN, leading to modulation of the resulting signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2015736238,"Variations of breeding success with age have been studied largely in iteroparous species and particularly in birds: survival of offspring increases with parental age until senescence. Nevertheless, these results are from observations of free-living individuals and therefore, it remains impossible to determine whether these variations result from parental investment or efficiency or both, and whether these variations occur during the prenatal or the postnatal stage or during both. Our study aimed first, to determine whether age had an impact on the expression of maternal breeding care by comparing inexperienced female birds of two different ages, and second, to define how these potential differences impact chicks’ growth and behavioural development. We made 22 2-month-old and 22 8-month-old female Japanese quail foster 1-day-old chicks. We observed their maternal behaviour until the chicks were 11 days old and then tested these chicks after separation from their mothers. Several behavioural tests estimated their fearfulness and their sociality. We observed first that a longer induction was required for young females to express maternal behaviour. Subsequently as many young females as elder females expressed maternal behaviour, but young females warmed chicks less, expressed less covering postures and rejected their chicks more. Chicks brooded by elder females presented higher growth rates and more fearfulness and sociality. Our results reveal that maternal investment increased with age independently of maternal experience, suggesting modification of hormone levels implied in maternal behaviour. Isolated effects of maternal experience should now be assessed in females of the same age. In addition, our results show, for first time in birds, that variations in maternal care directly induce important differences in the behavioural development of chicks. Finally, our results confirm that Japanese quail remains a great laboratory model of avian maternal behaviour and that the way we sample maternal behaviour is highly productive."
https://openalex.org/W1968646181,"The human transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. TAP plays an essential role in the antigen presentation pathway by translocating cytosolic peptides derived from proteasomal degradation into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Here, the peptides are loaded into major histocompatibility class I molecules to be in turn exposed at the cell surface for recognition by T-cells. TAP is a heterodimer formed by the association of two half-transporters, TAP1 and TAP2, with a typical ABC transporter core that consists of two nucleotide binding domains and two transmembrane domains. Despite the availability of biological data, a full understanding of the mechanism of action of TAP is limited by the absence of experimental structures of the full-length transporter. Here, we present homology models of TAP built on the crystal structures of P-glycoprotein, ABCB10, and Sav1866. The models represent the transporter in inward- and outward-facing conformations that could represent initial and final states of the transport cycle, respectively. We described conserved regions in the endoplasmic reticulum-facing loops with a role in the opening and closing of the cavity. We also identified conserved π-stacking interactions in the cytosolic part of the transmembrane domains that could explain the experimental data available for TAP1-Phe-265. Electrostatic potential calculations gave structural insights into the role of residues involved in peptide binding, such as TAP1-Val-288, TAP2-Cys-213, TAP2-Met-218. Moreover, these calculations identified additional residues potentially involved in peptide binding, in turn verified with replica exchange simulations performed on a peptide bound to the inward-facing models."

However, little is known about initiation of bacterial death under physiological conditions. Membrane depolarization has been suggested, but never shown to be involved, due to the difficulty of performing such studies in bacteria and the paucity of information that exists regarding ion transport mechanisms in prokaryotes. In this study, we performed the first extensive investigation of ion transport and membrane depolarization in a bacterial system. We found that HAMLET, a human milk protein-lipid complex, kills Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) in a manner that shares features with activation of physiological death from starvation. Addition of HAMLET to pneumococci dissipated membrane polarity, but depolarization per se was not enough to trigger death. Rather, both HAMLET- and starvation-induced death of pneumococci specifically required a sodium-dependent calcium influx, as shown using calcium and sodium transport inhibitors. This mechanism was verified under low sodium conditions, and in the presence of ionomycin or monensin, which enhanced pneumococcal sensitivity to HAMLET- and starvation-induced death. Pneumococcal death was also inhibited by kinase inhibitors, and indicated the involvement of Ser/Thr kinases in these processes. The importance of this activation mechanism was made evident, as dysregulation and manipulation of physiological death was detrimental to biofilm formation, a hallmark of bacterial colonization.

Objective To evaluate the effects of the web portal compared to no intervention in a real-life setting. Methods A pragmatic randomised controlled parallel trial using simple randomisation of 96 parents who had children aged <4 years. Parents were allocated to receive either access to the portal or no intervention, and assigned three tasks to perform over a three-week period. These included a searching task, a critical appraisal task, and reporting on perceptions about participation. Data were collected from March through June 2011. Results Use of the web portal was found to improve attitudes towards searching for health information. This variable was identified as the most important predictor of intention to search in both samples. Participants considered the web portal to have good usability, usefulness, and credibility. The intervention group showed slight increases in the use of evidence-based information, critical appraisal skills, and participation compared to the group receiving no intervention, but these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion Despite the fact that the study was underpowered, we found that the web portal may have a positive effect on attitudes towards searching for health information. Furthermore, participants considered the web portal to be a relevant tool. It is important to continue experimenting with web-based resources in order to increase user participation in health care decision-making. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01266798"

Here, we have explored whether ubiquitination, another major post-translational modification, takes place on RalA or B, and, if so, under which circumstances and for what purpose.

We show here that the endogenous RalA and RalB GTPases are ubiquitinated, which contributes to selective membrane localization. RalA (but not RalB) de-ubiquitination occurs in lipid raft microdomains and promotes raft endocytosis upon loss of cell-matrix interactions. HeLa cells were cultured as described previously (22Balakireva M. Rossé C. Langevin J. Chien Y.C. Gho M. Gonzy-Treboul G. Voegeling-Lemaire S. Aresta S. Lepesant J.A. Bellaiche Y. White M. Camonis J.

Plasmid and siRNA transfections were performed using Jet-PEI (Polyplus Transfection) and Hi-perfect (Qiagen), according to supplier protocols, respectively. siRNA for caveolin was a pool of four siRNAs from Qiagen. A vector (pRK5-Ubi) 8The abbreviations used are: UbiubiquitinCTXcholera toxin BGM1monosialotetrahexosylgangliosidePFAparaformaldehydeGEFguanosine exchange factor. to express proteins fused by their N terminus to ubiquitin was generated by inserting an oligonucleotide encoding ubiquitin in the polylinker of plasmid pRK5.

Inhibition of the proteasome was performed using 10 mm MG132 or ALLN for 4 h. Inhibition of lysosomes was performed using a combination of the inhibitors E-64 and pepstatin at 10 mg/ml and 50 mm, respectively, for 4 h. Inhibition of ubiquitination was achieved using the E1 inhibitor PYR41 at 50 mm for 6 h. Inhibition of dynamin-1 and -2 was performed with Dynasore (80 mm for 30 min). Destruction of lipid rafts was performed by treating cells with 15 mm methyl-b-cyclodextrin for 30 min. All inhibitors were purchased from Sigma. Cell lysis was performed using a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Lysates were mildly sonicated. Immunoprecipitation of vesicular stomatitis virus- or HA-tagged ubiquitin was carried out with vesicular stomatitis virus (Abcam) or HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) according to standard procedures. Sepharose G and A beads were purchased from GE Healthcare. The bound proteins and whole cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with the antibodies detecting the following proteins: RalA (BD 610222), RalB (Upstate 04-037; Cell Signaling 3523), b-catenin (BD 610154), caveolin-1 (BD 610060), and FLAG epitope (Sigma F1804). Secondary antibodies coupled to peroxidase were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and used at a dilution of 1/25,000. Purification of ubiquitinated proteins was performed according to published procedures (23Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Analysis of protein ubiquitination.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2002; (Chapter 14:Unit 14 5)Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In short, HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding a His6-tagged-ubiquitin (His6-Ubi) and/or Ral alleles. Then, 10 × 106 cells were lysed for the purification of ubiquitinated overexpressed proteins, and 20 × 106 cells for the purification of ubiquitinated endogenous ones. Cells were harvested in buffer B (PBS, pH 8, 6 m guanidium HCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm b-mercaptoethanol), lysed by sonication (cycles of 30 s for 15 min at 200 W; Bioruptor, diagenode) and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 100 ml of TALON metal affinity beads (Clontech; 1:1 slurry equilibrated in buffer B). Prior to purification, a 100-ml aliquot of the lysate was precipitated with 10% ethanol to eliminate buffer B and resuspended in 50 ml of sample buffer 2×. The resin was washed once with buffer B, twice with buffer 1B/2C (1 volume of buffer B, 2 volumes of buffer C), once in buffer 1B/3C (1 volume of buffer B, 3 volumes of buffer C), and once in buffer C. Buffer C is 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole in PBS, pH 8. Proteins were eluted with 100 ml of sample buffer supplemented with 200 mm DTT. For those experiments concerning the impact of adhesion on ubiquitination, 10 × 106 transfected cells were plated on a 10-cm dish coated with 1% agarose (cells in suspension) for 90 min and afterward on fibronectin (25 mg/ml), where cells were allowed to adhere for 20 min prior to lysis and purification. For RalA localization, cells were fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol for 10 min followed by 1 min in cold acetone at -20 °C. After saturation in 3% BSA in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, they were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (1/1,000 in 0.3% BSA in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cy3-coupled anti-mouse antibody and DAPI diluted in 0.3% BSA in PBS were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were mounted using ProLong (Invitrogen). The “t0” point cells were placed on ice for 20 min to inhibit endocytosis and incubated with CTX coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (15 mg/ml; Molecular Probes) and transferrin coupled to Alexa Fluor 647 (10 mg/ml; Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 4 °C. Finally, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min. In t = 40 min, cells were shifted from ice to 37 °C for 40 min prior to fixing with 3.7% PFA for 10 min at 4 °C. All cells were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS solution for 10 min on ice and processed for immunofluorescence as above. Cells in suspension were treated as adherent cells for CTX labeling and fixed with 3.7% PFA before being cytospun on slides. Images were acquired on an inverted microscope (model DMIRE2; Leica) equipped with a cool CCD camera (CoolSNAP HQ). The Z-positioning was accomplished using a piezoelectric motor, and stacks were processed and analyzed using the Metamorph software. We determined whether RalA and RalB can undergo ubiquitination in vivo (Fig. 1). Plasmids expressing Ral and His-tagged ubiquitin were transfected into HeLa cells together and separately as controls. Cobalt affinity chromatography was used to purify ubiquitin conjugates, followed by Western blotting to detect RalA and RalB, as done previously for Ras GTPases (18Jura N. Scotto-Lavino E. Sobczyk A. Bar-Sagi D. Differential modification of Ras proteins by ubiquitination.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 679-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1A, Western blot analysis using specific anti-Ral antibodies revealed two RalA and RalB ubiquitin-conjugated species: a major ubiquitinated band at 42 kDa and a minor ubiquitinated band at 35 kDa (arrowheads). These bands were not detected when His-tagged ubiquitin or Ral GTPases were expressed alone in the cells and disappeared when the experiments were performed in the presence of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitor PYR41 (24Yang Y. Kitagaki J. Dai R.M. Tsai Y.C. Lorick K.L. Ludwig R.L. Pierre S.A. Jensen J.P. Davydov I.V. Oberoi P. Li C.C. Kenten J.H. Beutler J.A. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. Inhibitors of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a new class of potential cancer therapeutics.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9472-9481Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1A). Ubiquitination of RalA mutants deleted of the C-terminal domain required for Ral membrane localization (RalA ΔCterm) was strongly decreased (supplemental Fig. 2C). HA-fused ubiquitin was also coexpressed with RalA or RalB, and ubiquitinated proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies. Both RalA and B were detected in these immunoprecipitates and displayed patterns similar to those obtained by affinity chromatography (Fig. 1B). Ral ubiquitination was neither cell type- nor species-specific. It was observed in murine cells (hamster HET-SR fibroblasts (25Deichman G.I. Kashleva H.A. Kluchareva T.E. Matveeva V.A. Clustering of discrete cell properties essential for tumorigenicity and metastasis. II. Studies of Syrian hamster embryo fibroblasts transformed by Rous sarcoma virus.Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 44: 908-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and CHO cells) as well as in human ones (HeLa (Fig. 1) and HEK293 (data not shown)). Considering that a single ubiquitin molecule is ∼8 kDa, Ral (25 kDa) was ubiquitinated mostly by one (minor band at ∼35 kDa) or two ubiquitin moieties (major band at ∼42 kDa), but higher molecular mass species were also observed (Fig. 1A). To distinguish between poly-ubiquitination (a second ubiquitin attached to a lysine of the first ubiquitin, attached directly to Ral) and multi-ubiquitination (a second ubiquitin attached directly to Ral), a plasmid expressing a vesicular stomatitis virus G-tagged ubiquitin mutated on all lysines (K0-ubiquitin) was used. Supplemental Fig. 1B shows that the same pattern of Ral ubiquitination was observed with both wild-type and K0-ubiquitin. The second ubiquitin is therefore not attached to the first one. When bi-ubiquitinated, the two ubiquitins are directly attached to Ral on different lysines. Poly-ubiquitination targets proteins for proteosomal degradation. Cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors MG132 or ALLN and lysosomal degradation inhibitors pepstatin + E64 or (Fig. 1C) leupeptin (data not shown). β-Catenin, which is known to be degraded after ubiquitination, accumulated in cells treated with MG132 or ALLN, whereas Ral never changed. Taken together, these results show that RalA and B undergo multi-ubiquitination in vivo and their ubiquitination does not regulate protein degradation. To ascertain whether the ubiquitination of Ral was dependent on its activation, we tested dominant active RalA mutants (G23V) and two dominant negative mutations (S28N and G26A). RalA G23V was more ubiquitinated than wild-type RalA, but the G26A and S28N mutants showed opposite behaviors, with the former more and the latter less ubiquitinated than wild type (supplemental Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained for RalB (data not shown). Ral GTPase activity therefore did not modulate their ubiquitination. Subsequent investigation concerned the link between Ral GTPase ubiquitination and function. RalA has been reported to support anchorage-independent growth (2Chien Y. White M.A. RAL GTPases are linchpin modulators of human tumour cell proliferation and survival.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In nonadherent cells, RalA promotes membrane raft exocytosis to sustain proliferative signaling (26Balasubramanian N. Meier J.A. Scott D.W. Norambuena A. White M.A. Schwartz M.A. RalA-exocyst complex regulates integrin-dependent membrane raft exocytosis and growth signaling.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 75-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Exogenous Ral GTPase ubiquitination status was therefore explored in nonadherent versus adherent cells. First, the ubiquitination of exogenous Ral GTPases was analyzed. Cells overexpressing RalA or RalB together with His6-Ubi were grown in adherent conditions or in suspension for 48 h (Fig. 2A). Nonadherent cells displayed a substantial and reproducible 2-fold increase in RalA ubiquitination (Fig. 2A). No variation in the ubiquitination level of RalB was detected under these conditions (Fig. 2A). When cells are detached from their substrate, lipid rafts are internalized. Upon reattachment to the matrix, rafts are exocytosed for surface display using the RalA/Sec5 pathway (26Balasubramanian N. Meier J.A. Scott D.W. Norambuena A. White M.A. Schwartz M.A. RalA-exocyst complex regulates integrin-dependent membrane raft exocytosis and growth signaling.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 75-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To test whether RalA ubiquitination might be regulated by raft trafficking or adhesion, RalA ubiquitination was investigated within the time frame of raft internalization (90 min of suspension) and re-exposure (20 min of re-adhesion). To avoid any effects of overexpressed RalA in cell adhesion, it was decided to follow endogenous RalA ubiquitination (Fig. 2C). Conditions to detect endogenous Ral GTPase ubiquitination were previously established (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 2A). By doubling the cell number (20 × 106) used for purification (compare experiments in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2B), it was possible to detect a major mono-ubiquitinated endogenous RalA band at 35 kDa and a weaker bi-ubiquitinated band at 42 kDa, suggesting that endogenous RalA is mostly mono-ubiquitinated. The bi-ubiquitinated band at 42 kDa increased in highly exposed blots (supplemental Fig. 2A), but higher exposure also revealed nonspecific 50-kDa bands. The proportion of mono-ubiquitinated endogenous RalA among RalA proteins increased by a 1.5 factor in cells detached from the substrate for 90 min (Fig. 2C) and returned to steady-state levels after 20 min of cell re-adhesion (Fig. 2C), when rafts are also re-exposed on the plasma membrane. These observations indicated that endogenous RalA ubiquitination was up-regulated upon cell detachment from the substrate and perhaps also upon raft endocytosis. We also confirmed that the activation of endogenous RalA did not regulate its ubiquitination because serum stimulation induced no change in endogenous RalA-ubiquitinated 35-and 42-kDa bands (supplemental Fig. 2A). Lipid raft endocytosis has been reported to be dependent on caveolin-1 and dynamin-2 (27Del Pozo M.A. Integrin signaling and lipid rafts.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 725-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28del Pozo M.A. Balasubramanian N. Alderson N.B. Kiosses W.B. Grande-García A. Anderson R.G. Schwartz M.A. Phospho-caveolin-1 mediates integrin-regulated membrane domain internalization.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 was depleted in His6-Ubi-expressing HeLa cells. The purification of endogenous ubiquitinated RalA was less efficient in RNAi-treated cells, but it was possible to detect the mono-ubiquitinated RalA band increasing 1.5-fold in siControl cells detached from the matrix compared with adherent cells (Fig. 2D). siCaveolin-1-treated cells showed a RalA ubiquitination inhibited by 80% in both adherent and nonadherent cells compared with siControl cells (Fig. 2D). When dynamin-2 was inhibited with the chemical inhibitor dynasore, decrease in endogenous RalA ubiquitination was also observed (Fig. 2E). Because RalA was less ubiquitinated when rafts were at the plasma membrane, one possibility could be that RalA is de-ubiquitinated in rafts at the plasma membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that when raft structures were destroyed (by treating cells for 30 min with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which extracts cholesterol) (29Kilsdonk E.P. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Cellular cholesterol efflux mediated by cyclodextrins.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), endogenous RalA ubiquitination was increased 1.5-fold (Fig. 2F). We conclude that lipid rafts at the plasma membrane are required for RalA de-ubiquitination. To explore the role of RalA ubiquitination, efforts were devoted to identifying the lysine(s) of Ral that are subjected to ubiquitination. By changing all 21 RalA lysine residues into arginine one by one, it was found that several lysines on RalA could serve as ubiquitination sites (supplemental Table 1). Ubiquitinated RalA was detected in all combinations with the exception of the variant in which all lysines were mutated (data not shown). These results showed that Ral can be ubiquitinated on several lysines, but precluded any genetic approach to unraveling the functional significance of Ral ubiquitination. It was therefore decided to use a constitutively ubiquitinated form of Ral in which the ubiquitin moiety was fused via a peptide bound to the N terminus of RalA or RalB. This approach has been successfully employed elsewhere for functional studies of Ras ubiquitination (18Jura N. Scotto-Lavino E. Sobczyk A. Bar-Sagi D. Differential modification of Ras proteins by ubiquitination.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 679-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Three FLAG epitopes were inserted between ubiquitin and the Ral protein, leading to a protein with a topology of N-ubiquitin-3×FLAG-Ral-C. The 3×FLAG-RalA and ubiquitin-3×FLAG-RalB fusions served as controls. These Ubi-Ral constructs were consistently highly overexpressed as fusion proteins, suggesting, as expected, that they are not sensitive to de-ubiquitin hydrolases (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3A and as previously published, RalA was observed at the plasma membrane as well as in endomembranes (30Shipitsin M. Feig L.A. RalA but not RalB enhances polarized delivery of membrane proteins to the basolateral surface of epithelial cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5746-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). By contrast, Ubi-RalA was almost totally absent from the cytoplasm and mainly localized at the plasma membrane. However, RalB was observed on endomembranes and at the plasma membrane, whereas Ubi-RalB was absent from the cytoplasm but accumulated in internal punctate structures of 400–900 nm in size (Fig. 3A). The different impacts of ubiquitin fusions on RalA and RalB localization strongly support the notion that ubiquitin fusion itself does not drive nonspecific protein localization and suggest that the ubiquitination of RalA is a signal for plasma membrane targeting or stabilization. To track the fate of rafts as a function of Ral ubiquitination status, the CTX receptor GM1 was used as a marker of lipid rafts, and transferrin receptor as a marker of clathrin-coated vesicles (31Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. Lipid domain structure of the plasma membrane revealed by patching of membrane components.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts were found scattered in low quantities at the plasma membrane of control cells either not transfected or transfected with plasmids expressing ubiquitin alone (data not shown) or FLAG-RalA (Fig. 3B; upper panel, t = 0). By contrast, lipid rafts were dramatically enriched at the plasma membrane of cells expressing Ubi-RalA (Fig. 3B; t = 0) but not Ubi-RalB (supplemental Fig. 3). The endocytosis of lipid rafts was then followed upon expression of RalA, RalB, Ubi-RalA, and Ubi-RalB. After binding of CTX-Alexa Fluor 488 to the ganglioside receptor GM1 at 4 °C, cells were washed and then shifted at 37 °C, and GM1 localization was observed 40 min later. In both nontransfected cells and cells transfected to express Ubi alone (data not shown), RalA (Fig. 3B, upper panel, t = 40), or RalB (supplemental Fig. 3), CTX was found to be predominantly internalized as “normal.” In contrast, cells expressing Ubi-RalA did not internalize GM1: almost all of the CTX-Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence was detected at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B; t = 40). Transferrin receptor was tracked in the same cells using transferrin-Alexa Fluor 647. The abundance of transferrin receptor at the plasma membrane and its internalization were not affected by the expression of Ubi-RalA (Fig. 3B), demonstrating the specificity of the effect of ubiquitinated RalA on lipid rafts. When Ubi-RalB was expressed, levels of labeled CTX and transferrin, as well as their localization and dynamics, were also equivalent to control (supplemental Fig. 3), indicating that the effect on lipid rafts was specific to ubiquitinated RalA. Ubi-RalA was also sufficient to inhibit GM1 internalization in suspension cells (Fig. 3B, lower panel). These results suggest that the de-ubiquitination of RalA is required for the endocytosis of lipid rafts. Because RalA-GTP is known to promote raft exposure (26Balasubramanian N. Meier J.A. Scott D.W.

https://openalex.org/W2085743604,"Purpose The purpose of the study was to: (1) evaluate the subarachnoid space (SAS) width and pial artery pulsation in both hemispheres, and (2) directly compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to near-infrared transillumination/backscattering sounding (NIR-T/BSS) measurements of SAS width changes in healthy volunteers. Methods The study was performed on three separate groups of volunteers, consisting in total of 62 subjects (33 women and 29 men) aged from 16 to 39 years. SAS width was assessed by MRI and NIR-T/BSS, and pial artery pulsation by NIR-T/BSS. Results In NIR-T/BSS, the right frontal SAS was 9.1% wider than the left (p<0.01). The SAS was wider in men (p<0.01), while the pial artery pulsation was higher in women (p<0.01). Correlation and regression analysis of SAS width changes between the back- and abdominal-lying positions measured with MRI and NIRT-B/SS demonstrated high interdependence between both methods (r = 0.81, p<0.001). Conclusions NIR-T/BSS and MRI were comparable and gave equivalent modalities for the SAS width change measurements. The SAS width and pial artery pulsation results obtained with NIR-T/BSS are consistent with the MRI data in the literature related to sexual dimorphism and morphological asymmetries between the hemispheres. NIR-T/BSS is a potentially cheap and easy-to-use method for early screening in patients with brain tumours, increased intracranial pressures and other abnormalities. Further studies in patients with intracranial pathologies are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2044789038,"NOD2 is one of the best characterized members of the cytosolic NOD-like receptor family. NOD2 is able to sense muramyl dipeptide, a specific bacterial cell wall component, and to subsequently induce various signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation and autophagy, both events contributing to an efficient innate and adaptive immune response. Interestingly, loss-of-function NOD2 variants were associated with a higher susceptibility for Crohn disease, which highlights the physiological importance of proper regulation of NOD2 activity. We performed a biochemical screen to search for new NOD2 regulators. We identified a new NOD2 partner, c-Jun N-terminal kinase-binding protein 1 (JNKBP1), a scaffold protein characterized by an N-terminal WD-40 domain. JNKBP1, through its WD-40 domain, binds to NOD2 following muramyl dipeptide activation. This interaction attenuates NOD2-mediated NF-κB activation and IL-8 secretion as well as NOD2 antibacterial activity. JNKBP1 exerts its repressor effect by disturbing NOD2 oligomerization and RIP2 tyrosine phosphorylation, both steps required for downstream NOD2 signaling. We furthermore showed that JNKBP1 and NOD2 are co-expressed in the human intestinal epithelium and in immune cells recruited in the lamina propria, which suggests that JNKBP1 contributes to maintain NOD2-mediated intestinal immune homeostasis."

However, the mechanisms explaining how Pim-1 mRNA stability is determined by its 3′-UTR are not well known. Here, we demonstrate that tristetraprolin (TTP) plays a critical role in the regulation of Pim-1 mRNA stability. Our results show that the level of Pim-1 expression is inversely correlated with TTP expression in human cancer cells. Pim-1 mRNA contains two AU-rich elements (ARE1 and ARE2) in the 3′-UTR. TTP bound to ARE2 and enhanced the decay of Pim-1 mRNA. Overexpression of TTP decreased Pim-1 expression and p21 and p27 phosphorylation and inhibited cell growth. Overexpression of Pim-1 cDNA without the 3′-UTR attenuated the inhibitory effects of TTP on p21 phosphorylation and cell growth. In addition, inhibition of p21 by siRNA attenuated the inhibitory effect of TTP on cell growth. Our results suggest that TTP post-transcriptionally down-regulates Pim-1 expression and that the overexpression of TTP may contribute to tumor suppression in part by down-regulating Pim-1 expression.

In this study, we investigated the role of TTP in the post-transcriptional regulation of Pim-1 gene expression in human prostate cancer cells. Here, we report that the overexpression of TTP decreased the Pim-1 expression levels in LNCaP cells. TTP bound to the AUUUA motif in the 3′-UTR of Pim-1 mRNA and promoted the AUUUA motif-mediated degradation of the Pim-1 mRNA. Mutation in the ARE motif prevented the binding of TTP to this motif and the degradation of the luciferase gene containing the Pim-1 3′-UTR. Overexpression of TTP in LNCaP cells decreased the phosphorylation of Pim-1 substrates p21 and p27 and significantly inhibited the growth of cells, and transfection of Pim-1 cDNA without the 3′-UTR restored the phosphorylation of p21 and p27 and cell growth. Together, our findings suggest that TTP inhibits the expression of Pim-1 through interaction with the ARE motif in the Pim-1 3′-UTR and that limiting cellular TTP levels or mutation in the Pim-1 ARE motif can enhance the Pim-1 level, which may contribute to the development and progression of several types of cancers. The human cancer cell lines DU145, LNCaP (prostate carcinoma), and HeLa were purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). A549, DU145, and LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM. All cell lines were supplemented with 10% FBS (WelGENE, Inc., Daegu, Korea) were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The pcDNA6/V5-TTP construct has been described previously (32.Lee H.H. Vo M.T. Kim H.J. Lee U.H. Kim C.W. Kim H.K. Ko M.S. Lee W.H. Cha S.J. Min Y.J. Choi D.H. Suh H.S. Lee B.J. Park J.W. Cho W.J.

Full-length human Pim-1 was amplified from the cDNA of LNCaP cells using PCR primers 5′-GGATCCACGATGCTCTTGTCCAA-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGAAAGGCTGCTATTTGCT-3′ (with restriction enzyme sites underlined). The PCR product was ligated into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pCMVT2B/FLAG (Stratagene) to generate pCMVT2B/FLAG-Pim-1. The cells were transfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP or pCMVT2B/FLAG-Pim-1 using TurboFectTM in vitro transfection reagent (Fermentas, Hanover, MD). siRNAs against human Pim-1 (sc-36225) and p21 (sc-29427) and control siRNA (scrambled siRNA; sc-37007) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A549 cells were transfected with siRNA using LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were collected, and the level of Pim-1 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Two of the deletion mutants of the Pim-1 3′-UTR were PCR-amplified from the cDNA of LNCaP cells using Taq polymerase (Solgent, Daejeon, Korea) and the following primer sets: Frag-ARE1, 5′-CGCTCGAGCAGCCTTTCTGGCA-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCTCGGAAGAGGTGAC-3′; and Frag-ARE2, 5′-CGCTCGAGTGGAAGAGGCTACA-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCAACTGCTTTTCATA-3′ (with restriction enzyme sites underlined). The PCR products were inserted into the XhoI/NotI sites of the psiCHECK2 Renilla/firefly Dual-Luciferase expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Oligonucleotide containing AUUUA (Oligo-ARE2 WT, 5′-TCGAGCCTGGAGGTCAATGTTATGTATTTATTTATTTATTTATTTGGTTCCCTTCCTATTCCGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCGGAATAGGAAGGGAACCAAATAAATAAATAAATAAATACATAACATTGACCTCCAGGC-3′) and mutant oligonucleotides in which the AUUUA pentamers were substituted with AGCA (Oligo-ARE2 MUT, 5′-TCGAGCCTGGAGGTCAATGTTATGTAGCAGCAGCAGCATTTGGTTCCCTTCCTATTCCGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCGGAATAGGAAGGGAACCAAATGCTGCTGCTGCTACATAACATTGACCTCCAGGC-3′, with restriction enzyme sites underlined) in the Pim-1 mRNA 3′-UTR were synthesized at Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The oligonucleotides were ligated into the XhoI/NotI sites of the psiCHECK2 vector. For luciferase assays, LNCaP and HeLa cells were cotransfected with various types of psiCHECK2-Pim-1 3′-UTR constructs and pcDNA6/V5-TTP using TurboFectTM in vitro transfection reagent. Transfected cells were lysed with lysis buffer (Promega) and mixed with luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and the chemiluminescence signal was measured in a SpectraMax L microplate (Molecular Devices). Firefly luciferase was normalized to Renilla luciferase in each sample. Cells were harvested, washed twice in PBS at room temperature, and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in PBS. For propidium iodide staining, the washed cells were fixed overnight in pure ethanol at −20 °C and then treated according to the manufacturer's procedure (Molecular Probes). Cells were washed twice in PBS, resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS, 0.2% BSA, and 1% sodium azide), and analyzed using a FACSFlow cytometer (BD Biosciences). DNase I-treated total RNA (3 μg) was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed using the following primer sets: TTP, CGCTACAAGACTGAGCTAT and GAGGTAGAACTTGTGACAGA; Pim-1, TCTCATTAGATGGTGCTTGGCCCT and TGTGGAGGTGGATCTCAGCAGTTT; Pim-2, TGTCAGACTCAGTCACATGCCCA and ATCAATGAGTTTGGCACAGCCACG; Pim-3, TGCACCGCGACATTAAGGACGAAA and ACACCATATCGTAGAGAAGCACGC; and GAPDH, ATCTTCAAGCCATCCTGTGTGC and TGCGCTTGTCACATTTTTCTTG. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman), and probed with the appropriate dilutions of the following antibodies: anti-human TTP (ab36558, Abcam); anti-V5 (20-783-70389, GenWay Biotech, Inc.); and anti-human Pim-1 (2409-1), anti-p21 (2990-1), anti-phospho-p21 (T3753), anti-p27 (2814-1), and anti-phospho-p27 (T3757) (Epitomics, Inc.). Immunoreactivity was detected using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Films were exposed at multiple time points to ensure that the images were not saturated. For the RNA kinetic analysis, we used actinomycin D and assessed expression of Pim-1 and luciferase mRNAs by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). qRT-PCR was performed using the ABI StepOnePlusTM system by monitoring in real time the increase in fluorescence of Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The specificity of each primer pair was confirmed by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. The same Pim-1 and GAPDH primer pairs as described above were used, with the following luciferase primer pair: qLuc, ACGTGCTGGACTCCTTCATC and GACACTCTCAGCATGGACGA. The biotinylated RNA probes for wild-type (5′-CCUGGAGGUCAAUGUUAUGUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUGGUUCCCUUCCUAUUCC-3′) and mutant (5′-CCUGGAGGUCAAUGUUAUGUAGCAGCAGCAGCAUUUGGUUCCCUUCCUAUUCC-3′) Pim-1 ARE2 were synthesized by ST Pharm Co., Ltd. (Seoul, Korea). A mutant RNA probe in which four AUUUA petamers were each substituted with AGCA was used as a negative control. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from LNCaP and HeLa cells non-transfected or transfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent (Pierce). RNA EMSA was performed using the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 50 fmol of biotinylated RNA was combined with 3 μg of cytoplasmic protein extract in binding buffer. For competition EMSA, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant RNA probe was added to the binding reaction. For the supershift EMSA, anti-V5 antibody, anti-human TTP antibody, or control antibody (I-5381, Sigma) was added to the reaction mixture. After the addition of antibodies, reaction mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The reaction mixtures were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Gels were transferred to a nylon membrane (HybondTM-N+) in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA at 70 V for 1 h at 4 °C. The RNAs were UV light-cross-linked to the membrane and detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase binding and chemiluminescence. For ribonucleoprotein precipitation assay, the biotinylated RNA probe-protein complexes in the reaction mixture were precipitated using streptavidin magnetic beads (656-01, Invitrogen). TTP proteins in the precipitated samples were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-V5 antibody. For the MTS cell proliferation assay, LNCaP cells were plated in triplicate at 5.0 × 104 cells/well in 96-well culture plates in RPMI 1640 medium. At the indicated times, CellTiter 96® AQueous One solution reagent (Promega) was added to each well according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance at 490 nm was determined for each well using a Wallac 1420 VICTOR multilabel counter. For statistical comparisons, p values were determined using Student's t test It has previously been reported that Pim-1 mRNA has a short half-life due to the presence of ARE motifs in the 3′-UTR (24.Selten G.

TTP is an ARE-binding protein and enhances the degradation of ARE-containing transcripts (27.Blackshear P.J.

AU-binding proteins recruit the exosome to degrade ARE-containing mRNAs.Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible to speculate that the expression of Pim-1 is post-transcriptionally regulated by TTP. To confirm this hypothesis, we first examined TTP and Pim-1 expression levels by Western blotting in four human cancer cell lines: DU145, LNCaP, A549, and HeLa. The expression level of TTP was high in DU145 and A549 cells but extremely low in LNCaP and HeLa cells. In contrast, the level of Pim-1 expression in A549 and DU145 cells was low compared with that in LNCaP and HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). We next determined whether the overexpression of TTP could reduce the Pim-1 expression in LNCaP and HeLa cells. Cells were transfected with the TTP expression vector (pcDNA6/V5-TTP) or the pcDNA6/V5 empty vector as a negative control. Overexpression of TTP in LNCaP and HeLa cells was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1A). Overexpression of TTP significantly inhibited the level of Pim-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1B). It has been reported that the Pim-1 gene encodes two isoforms of 34 and 44 kDa through the use of alternative translation initiation codons of the Pim-1 mRNA (34.Saris C.J. Domen J. Berns A. The pim-1 oncogene encodes two related serine/threonine protein kinases by alternative initiation at AUG and CUG.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Overexpression of TTP inhibited the levels of both Pim-1 isoforms (supplemental Fig. 1C). The Pim kinase family consists of three members: Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3. To determine whether the expression of Pim-2 and Pim-3 is affected by TTP, we analyzed their expression levels by RT-PCR in LNCaP and HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP or pcDNA6/V5. overexpression of TTP did not affect the expression levels of both Pim-2 and Pim-3 (supplemental Fig. 1, D and E). We also tested whether the down-regulation of TTP affects Pim-1 expression. For this purpose, we used A549 cells expressing high levels of TTP. A549 cells were transfected with siRNA against TTP to reduce the expression level of TTP. Although treatment with nonspecific siRNA (scrambled siRNA) did not induce a change in Pim-1 expression, down-regulation of TTP by siRNA significantly increased the level of Pim-1 expression (Fig. 1D). However, the inhibition of TTP by siRNA did not affect the levels of Pim-2 and Pim-3 (supplemental Fig. 1F). These results indicate that TTP down-regulates Pim-1 expression in human cancer cells. To determine whether TTP-induced inhibition of Pim-1 expression resulted from changes in the stability of Pim-1 mRNA, the half-life of this mRNA was measured by qRT-PCR LNCaP and HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP (LNCaP/TTP and HeLa/TTP, respectively) or the pcDNA6/V5 control vector (LNCaP/pcDNA and HeLa/pcDNA, respectively). In the control LNCaP/pcDNA and HeLa/pcDNA cells, the half-life of Pim-1 mRNA was >1 h after actinomycin D treatment. However, in the TTP-overexpressing cells, the half-life was reduced to <30 min in LNCaP/TTP cells (Fig. 2A) and to <1 h in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. 2A). These results indicate that the overexpression of TTP contributes to a decrease in Pim-1 levels through the destabilization of Pim-1 mRNA. The TTP protein regulates mRNA stability through binding to the AREs in the mRNA 3′-UTR (27.Blackshear P.J.

Consistent with a previous study (25.Wingett D. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. Stability changes in pim-1 proto-oncogene mRNA after mitogen stimulation of normal lymphocytes.J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3653-3659PubMed Google Scholar), analysis of the 1335-bp-long human Pim-1 3′-UTR revealed the presence of two ARE motifs: ARE1 (AUUUA) and ARE2 (AUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUA) (Fig. 2B). To determine whether they are necessary for the TTP inhibitory effect, we used a luciferase reporter gene linked to the Pim-1 3′-UTR fragments containing the AREs (Frag-ARE1 or Frag-ARE2) in plasmid psiCHECK. When LNCaP cells were transfected to overexpress TTP (Fig. 2A), the half-life of the reporter gene linked to Frag-ARE2 was significantly decreased (<1 h) compared with the original reporter gene (>1 h) (Fig. 2E), and the luciferase activity of Frag-ARE2 was dramatically inhibited by 84% (Fig. 2C). However, Frag-ARE1 abrogated the effects of TTP on the half-life (>1 h) and activity (6% inhibition) of the reporter gene in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2, C and E). To determine whether the ARE2 motif in Frag-ARE2 is essential for the TTP inhibitory effect, we prepared the oligonucleotide Oligo-ARE2 WT (containing ARE2) and its deletion mutant, Oligo-ARE2 MUT (Fig. 2B). The ARE2 mutant prevented the TTP effects on the half-life and activity of the reporter gene (Fig. 2, D and E), strongly suggesting that Pim-1 ARE2 is involved in the TTP inhibitory activity. ARE2 of Pim-1 was also responsible for the TTP inhibitory effect in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. 2, B and C). To determine whether TTP interacts with the ARE2 in the Pim-1 3′-UTR, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from LNCaP or HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP to overexpress TTP and incubated with a biotinylated RNA probe containing wild-type or mutant ARE2 of Pim-1. The biotinylated RNA probe-protein complexes were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose, and the presence of TTP in the precipitates was determined by Western blotting using anti-V5 antibody. Although a TTP band was observed in the precipitated samples obtained using wild-type Pim-1 ARE2, it was not detected in the samples using mutant Pim-1 ARE2 (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B). These results demonstrate that TTP interacts specifically with Pim-1 ARE2. To confirm the interaction between TTP with Pim-1 ARE2, RNA EMSA was conducted. When RNA EMSA was conducted using the wild-type Pim-1 ARE2 probe, a dominant probe-protein complex was observed. However, mutation of Pim-1 ARE2 prevented the formation of this complex. The complex was reduced, and a high molecular weight antibody complex was formed by preincubation of the reaction mixture with anti-V5 antibody but not with control antibody (Fig. 2F a"

Conjugation of ligands to different SNAP-tag fusions permits the validation of suspected interactions in cell extracts and fixed cells as well as the establishment of high-throughput assays. The different assays allow the analysis of strong and weak interactions. Conversion of ligands into SNAP-tag substrates thus provides access to a powerful toolbox for the analysis of their interactions with proteins.

Although laser and UV irradiation have immunosuppressive effects on inflammatory diseases by suppressing mast cells, little is known about the effects of γ-ionizing radiation on mast cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of γ-ionizing radiation on RBL-2H3 cells, a convenient model system for studying regulated secretion by mast cells. Low-dose radiation (<0.1 gray (Gy)) did not induce cell death, but high-dose radiation (>0.5 Gy) induced apoptosis. Low-dose ionizing radiation significantly suppressed the release of mediators (histamine, β-hexosaminidase, IL-4, and tumor necrosis factor-α) from immunoglobulin E (IgE)-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells. To determine the mechanism of mediator release inhibition by ionizing radiation, we examined the activation of intracellular signaling molecules such as Lyn, Syk, phospholipase Cγ, PKCs, and MAPK, and intracellular free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i). The phosphorylation of signaling molecules following stimulation of high-affinity IgE receptor I (FcϵRI) was specifically inhibited by low-dose ionizing radiation (0.01 Gy). These results were due to the suppression of FcϵRI expression by the low-dose ionizing radiation. Therefore, low-dose ionizing radiation (0.01 Gy) may function as a novel inhibitor of mast cell activation.

Perhaps the most controversial and disputed field of radiation biology is the biological effects of low-dose radiation. The immune-suppressing effects of high-dose radiation have been clearly demonstrated and confirmed both experimentally and in epidemiological studies (1Akiyama M.

However, the effects of low-dose ionizing radiation on the immune system remain controversial. The connection between UV radiation and the immune system was recognized ∼30 years ago, resulting in the development of photoimmunology. A single or limited number of UV radiation exposures can suppress cell-mediated immunity (3Hanneman K.K. Cooper K.D. Baron E.D. Ultraviolet immunosuppression: mechanisms and consequences.Dermatol.

Specifically, the narrow band of UVB and UVA phototherapy is a mainstay of treatments; both natural and artificial UVB irradiations are commonly employed in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (5Jekler J.

Although laser and UV irradiation have immunosuppressive effects on inflammatory diseases by suppressing mast cells, little is known about the effects of ionizing radiation on mast cells. For many years, mast cells have been considered to participate specifically in allergic reactions (8Bradding P. Walls A.F. Holgate S.T. The role of the mast cell in the pathophysiology of asthma.J.

Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of FcϵRI-bound IgE with multivalent antigens initiates the activation of mast cells by promoting the aggregation of FcϵRI (11Kawakami T. Galli S.J. Regulation of mast cell and basophil function and survival by IgE.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The FcϵRI-dependent mast cell activation process has three outcomes: (i) degranulation: secretion of preformed mediators that are stored in cytoplasmic granules of the cell; (ii) the de novo synthesis of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators; and (iii) synthesis and secretion of cytokines and chemokines (11Kawakami T. Galli S.J. Regulation of mast cell and basophil function and survival by IgE.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). This activation process constitutes an important step in the immediate hypersensitivity reaction that occurs during allergic diseases such as urticaria, bronchial asthma, and allergic rhinitis (12Kitamura Y. Heterogeneity of mast cells and phenotypic change between subpopulations.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 59-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). high-affinity IgE receptor I dinitrophenyl gray human serum albumin 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide rat basophilic leukemia. Low-dose ionizing radiation has positive biostimulation effects on living organisms both in vitro and in vivo and has various applications in the medical field (14Nowosielska E.M. Cheda A. Wrembel-Wargocka J. Janiak M.K. Immunological mechanism of the low-dose radiation induced suppression of cancer metastases in a mouse model.Dose-Response. 2010; 8: 209-226Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, few studies have extensively studied the effects of low-dose ionizing radiation, unlike UV radiation, on allergic reactions resulting from mast cell activation. Therefore, we first examined whether low-dose ionizing radiation modulates allergic reaction by activated mast cells. Rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (GIBCO) containing 15% FBS (GIBCO) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 95% air and 5% CO2. RBL-2H3 cells were irradiated with 0.01–5 Gy using a 137Cs γ-irradiator (IBL 437C; CIS Bio International, Bangnols sur Ceze, France) with a dose rate of 0.8 Gy/min for high-dose rate irradiation (acute irradiation). A low-dose rate irradiation facility equipped with a 137Cs source and a dose rate of 0.01 Gy/h was used for low-dose rate irradiation (chronic irradiation). Cell viability was measured using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye (Sigma) 48 h and 72 h after irradiation. Yellow MTT is reduced to purple formazan in the mitochondria of living cells. The absorbance of this colored solution was measured at 540 nm spectrophotometer (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) (15Tada H. Shiho O. Kuroshima K. Koyama M. Tsukamoto K. An improved colorimetic assay for interleukin 2.J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 93: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). For long-term cell survival determination, irradiated cells were seeded in methylcellulose complete medium (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). After 14 days of incubation, colonies were stained with nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) and counted (>50 cells). Data were normalized to untreated control plating efficiencies. RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with 0.1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) (IgE) Ab clone SPE-7 (Sigma). Cells were washed with modified Tyrode's buffer consisting of 137 mm NaCl, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 2.6 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm dextrose, 1 g/liter glucose, 1 μg/liter gelatin, pH 7.4. Cells were irradiated with 0.01–2 Gy before stimulation with 0.01 μg/ml DNP-human serum albumin (HSA) (Sigma). After 1 h, histamine concentrations were detected using enzyme immunoassay kits (Oxford Biomedical Research, Rochester Hills, MI). The amount of released histamine was expressed as a percentage of the total histamine produced by unstimulated cells (16Siraganian R.P. Hook W.A. Histamine Release and Assay Methods for the Study of Human Allergy: Manual of Clinical Immunology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C1980Google Scholar). To determine β-hexosaminidase release, supernatants and lysed pellets were aliquoted into 96-well plates. Samples were mixed with substrate solution (1 mm p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine in 0.05 m citrate buffer, pH 4.5) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.05 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 10. Absorbance was measured with a spectrophotometer (Labsystems) at 405 nm (17Oka T. Hori M. Tanaka A. Matsuda H. Karaki H. Ozaki H. IgE-alone-induced actin assembly modifies calcium signaling and degranulation in RBL-2H3 mast cells.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells were irradiated and stimulated with DNP-HSA for 5 h. IL-4 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) concentrations in cell culture supernatants were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems, Inc.). RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized, irradiated, and incubated with 5 μm Fluo-3/AM (Molecular Probes) in modified Tyrode's buffer (without CaCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells were stimulated with DNP-HSA. Fluo-3/AM fluorescence intensities were monitored using a microplate fluorometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Cytosolic free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) were calculated as described previously (18Suzuki Y. Yoshimaru T. Matsui T. Inoue T. Niide O. Nunomura S. Ra C. FcϵRI signaling of mast cells activates intracellular production of hydrogen peroxide: role in the regulation of calcium signals.J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6119-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Following treatment RBL-2H3 cells were harvested, washed, and lysed. Cell lysates of equal protein concentrations were subjected to immunoblotting. RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized and irradiated with 0.01–0.5 Gy. After 30 min incubation, cells were treated with FITC-conjugated rat anti-IgE (BD Pharmingen) and analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter). RBL-2H3 cells, cultured on 5 mm glass coverslips, were stimulated and irradiated. After 30 min incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for in PBS containing 0.1% saponin, 5% FBS, and 2% BSA. Coverslips were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 30 min with FITC-conjugated rat anti-IgE. After washing and mounting, fluorescence image were observed using a fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 200; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) (19Asai K. Fujimoto K. Harazaki M. Kusunoki T. Korematsu S.

Experimental data are represented as means ± S.E. The analysis of significance between controls and experimental groups was performed using SAS software (version 8.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and t tests. p values <0.05 were considered significant. The reduction of cell viability by ionizing radiation is commonly used as a criterion to determine irradiation-induced cytotoxicity. Therefore, we examined the cell viability following various doses of ionizing radiation before investigating the effects of ionizing radiation in the activated RBL-2H3 cells. We used the MTT assay to assess short-term cell viability (48 h and 72 h after irradiation) and the colony-forming assay to examine long-term viability (14 days after irradiation). Changes in cell viability following low-dose radiation (<0.1 Gy) were not detected. However, cell viability following high-dose radiation (>0.5 Gy) was significantly reduced in both short-term and long-term analyses compared with that of non-irradiated cells (Fig. 1). To examine the effects of ionizing radiation on mediator release following activation of IgE-mediated RBL-2H3 cells, we measured histamine and β-hexosaminidase levels in culture supernatants. Acute low-dose ionizing radiation decreased histamine release by RBL-2H3 cells with statistical significance in the range of 0.01–0.1 Gy (Fig. 2A), β-hexosaminidase release also decreased similarly (Fig. 2B). To examine the effects of chronic low-dose radiation, RBL-2H3 cells were continually irradiated at a dose rate of 0.01 Gy/h until the final accumulated dose reached 0.001–0.05 Gy. Both histamine and β-hexosaminidase release were most significantly inhibited by irradiation with 0.01 Gy (Fig. 2, C and D). This finding correlated with the results from the acute irradiation. As shown in Fig. 2, low-dose radiation, especially 0.01 Gy, inhibited mast cell degranulation. Thus, we examined whether low-dose radiation would alter the secretion of IL-4 and TNF-α by RBL-2H3 cells following IgE-mediated stimulation. Challenging IgE-sensitized mast cells with antigens led to the production of multiple cytokines. Because IL-4 and TNF-α play important roles in allergic diseases induced by mast cell activation, effects of low-dose radiation on the production of these cytokines were examined. Low-dose radiation significantly inhibited IL-4 and TNF-α production (Fig. 3, A and B). To observe the effects of chronic radiation, we measured cytokine production after cells were irradiated with 0.001–0.05 Gy at 0.01 Gy/h dose rate. We used a specific negative control for each condition because radiation exposure times varied due to the accumulated doses. However, there is no difference in cytokine production between the negative controls. Chronic low-dose irradiation with 0.01 Gy and 0.05 Gy significantly inhibited IL-4 and TNF-α production (Fig. 3, C and D). FcϵRI-mediated degranulation is dependent on calcium influx (12Kitamura Y. Heterogeneity of mast cells and phenotypic change between subpopulations.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 59-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to learn more about the mechanism of degranulation suppression following low-dose radiation, we examined intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in RBL-2H3 cells. In IgE-sensitized mast cells, DNP-HSA stimulation enhanced calcium mobilization within a few seconds and maximized mobilization after ∼6 min, and maintained mobilization through 15 min (Fig. 4). RBL-2H3 cells that were exposed to ionizing radiation in the range of 0.01–0.5 Gy showed decreased levels of calcium influx in a dose-dependent manner compared with the IgE-mediated activation group (Fig. 4). Low-dose radiation decreased mast cell degranulation and cytokine production. Therefore, we asked whether the inhibitory effect of low-dose radiation occurs only during IgE-mediated signaling. To examine whether the inhibitory effects on degranulation and cytokine production by low-dose radiation were dependent on the FcϵRI-mediated signaling, we compared IgE-mediated reactions with reactions mediated by agonists, such as the calcium ionophore A23187 and LPS, which are unrelated to FcϵRI-mediated signaling in RBL-2H3 cells. Low-dose radiation did not inhibit mast cell degranulation by A23187 and cytokine production by LPS. The inhibitory effect of low-dose radiation was only observed during IgE-mediated mast cell activation (Fig. 5). To investigate the signaling mechanism of the inhibitory effect on degranulation by low-dose ionizing radiation, we examined early intracellular signaling events. DNP-HSA treatment of IgE-sensitized cells induced phosphorylation of Lyn, Syk, PKCs, and phospholipase Cγ at early time, this phosphorylation was reduced following low-dose radiation (Fig. 6, A and B). Specifically, RBL-2H3 cells irradiated with 0.01 Gy had the lowest phosphorylation levels as compared with cells irradiated with the other doses (Fig. 6B). During IgE-mediated activation of mast cells, three major subfamilies of MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) were activated, which resulted in cytokine production (21Zhang C. Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Beaven M.A. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase regulates production of tumor necrosis factor-α and release of arachidonic acid in mast cells: indications of communication between p38 and p42 MAP kinases.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13397-13402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To further identify relevant downstream effectors that directly modulated cytokine production following low-dose ionizing irradiation, we examined the levels of phosphorylated ERK, JNK, and p38. The phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 were most inhibited by low-dose ionizing radiation (Fig. 6D). We examined whether low-dose radiation altered FcϵRI expression because low-dose radiation suppressed FcϵRI-mediated early stage signaling (Lyn and Syk). Low-dose ionizing radiation reduced the expression of FcϵRI in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). As seen with our previous data, 0.01 Gy decreased the expression of FcϵRI most dramatically. Additionally, we observed the expression of FcϵRI using fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 7B). FcϵRI expression was remarkably reduced following low-dose ionizing radiation (0.01 Gy). However, the reduction was nearly absent at the dose of 0.5 Gy. To further evaluate the effect of ionizing radiation on receptor internalization, we performed fluorescence microscopy analysis. Sensitized cells were stimulated with DNP-HSA for 30 min with or without radiation pretreatment. Fixed and permeabilized cells were stained with FITC-conjugated rat anti-IgE. After 30 min, FcϵRI was internalized and present in endocytic vesicles dispersed throughout the cytoplasm of RBL-2H3 cells. At this same time point, there were reduced numbers of endocytic vesicles in the cytoplasm of cells treated with low-dose ionizing radiation (0.01 Gy), whereas the endocytic vesicles in cells treated with 0.5 Gy were similar to those in the positive control cells without radiation treatments (Fig. 8). Although high-dose ionizing radiation is carcinogenic, ionizing radiation can have different effects on immune responses depending on doses and dose rates. Therefore, we examined the immunomodulatory effects of low-dose ionizing on mast cells that contribute to allergic responses, one type of hypersensitivity. Because IgE-dependent release of mediators can begin within minutes of antigen challenge, the crucial roles of mast cells in acute allergic reactions are now widely accepted (8Bradding P. Walls A.F.

RBL-2H3 cells are a histamine-releasing cell line commonly used in inflammation, allergy, and immunological research (22Passante E. Frankish N. The RBL-2H3 cell line: its provenance and suitability as a model for the mast cell.Inflamm. Res. 2009; 58: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells have been extensively to investigate the interactions of IgE with FcϵRI because RBL-2H3 cells possess some typical characteristics of mast cells (22Passante E. Frankish N. The RBL-2H3 cell line: its provenance and suitability as a model for the mast cell.Inflamm. Res. 2009; 58: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of low-dose ionizing radiation on mast cell activation using RBL-2H3 cells. Following exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation, RBL-2H3 cells activated through IgE cross-linking significantly reduced production levels of IL-4 and TNF-α and decreased release of mediators through degranulation. These results suggest that 0.01 Gy of low-dose radiation is an effective approach for inhibiting host hypersensitivity responses. There are two types of radiation exposure, acute and chronic. Acute exposure is a sudden dose that occurs over a short time, and chronic exposure is a dose that occurs for long time with at a low-dose rate. Therefore, we examined whether the biological effects of acute and chronic irradiation are different. Activated RBL-2H3 cells were suppressed by both acute and chronic irradiation (Figs. 2 and 3). To determine whether the inhibition of mast cell activation by low-dose radiation only occurred during FcϵRI-mediated activation, we examined the effect of ionizing radiation on calcium ionophore (A23187)-induced degranulation and LPS-induced cytokine production. A23187 induces artificial activation of mast cells and is routinely used to study exocytosis by bypassing the molecular events that are associated with FcϵRI excitation (23Baranes D. Razin E. Protein kinase C regulates proliferation of mast cells and the expression of the mRNAs of fos and jun proto-oncogenes during activation by IgE-Ag or calcium ionophore A23187.Blood. 1991; 78: 2354-2364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS from most species of Gram-negative bacteria activates cells via TLRs and can activate mast cells to produce cytokines without degranulation (24Leal-Berumen I. Conlon P. Marshall J.S.

Biol. 2001; 70: 977-984PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the inhibitory effects of low-dose ionizing radiation on mast cells occurred only during activation through FcϵRIs. Based on these results, the inhibitory effect of low-dose radiation was likely caused by suppressing the initial steps of mast cell activation. Therefore, we examined whether low-dose radiation inhibited the expression of FcϵRI because the resulting mast cell activation was induced by the crossing of FcϵRI and IgE. Although mast cells were irradiated for only a short time, FcϵRI expression was dramatically reduced (Fig. 7). According to a recent report, lipid rafts are specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane that play an important role in FcϵRI signaling (26Oliver C. Fujimura A. Silveira E Souza A.M. Orlandini de Castro R. Siraganian R.P. Jamur M.C. Mast cell-specific gangliosides and FcϵRI follow the same endocytic pathway from lipid rafts in RBL-2H3 cells.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2007; 55: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These microdomains are thought to be important sites for protein tyrosine kinase-mediated protein-protein interactions that are involved in the initiation of receptor signaling pathways (27Silveira e Souza A.M. Mazucato V.M. de Castro R.O. Matioli F. Ciancaglini P. de Paiva Paulino T. Jamur M.C. Oliver C. The α-galactosyl derivatives of ganglioside GD1b are essential for the organization of lipid rafts in RBL-2H3 mast cell.Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 2515-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, FcϵRI is loosely dispersed throughout the plasma membranes of unstimulated cells, but upon activation, FcϵRI rapidly aggregates and can be found in lipid rafts in association with gangliosides. Following aggregation, FcϵRI is internalized in coated vesicles (26Oliver C. Fujimura A. Silveira E Souza A.M. Orlandini de Castro R. Siraganian R.P. Jamur M.C. Mast cell-specific gangliosides and FcϵRI follow the same endocytic pathway from lipid rafts in RBL-2H3 cells.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2007; 55: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated endocytosis, including endocytosis of FcϵRI, is a temporally and spatially organized process. Following the binding of a ligand to its receptor, the receptor clusters in lipid rafts of the plasma membrane. Full activation of FcϵRI requires receptor redistribution into lipid rafts. Upon FcϵRI engagement, membrane rafts coalesce into larger and more stable structures where engaged receptors are concentrated and more easily interact with signaling molecules such as activated Lyn (28Molfetta R. Gasparrini F. Santoni A. Paolini R. Ubiquitination and endocytosis of the high-affinity receptor for IgE.Mol. Immunol. 2010; 47: 2427-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduction of FcϵRI expression following low-dose radiation resulted in reduced receptor internalization and, therefore, decreased release of mediators and cytokines. In conclusion, both acute and chronic low-dose radiation did not induce mast cell death and inhibited mast cell degranulation and cytokine production by FcϵRI-dependent signaling suppression via the reduction of FcϵRI expression in mast cell. Therefore, we suggest that 0.01 Gy of low-dose radiation is an effective approach for inhibiting host inflammatory disease because inflammatory disease, like allergic disease, is related to mast cell activation. So why did higher doses radiation cause less inhibition of activation than lower doses? We suggest that it is the hormesis effect, which is the term for generally favorable biological responses to low exposure to toxins. Although ionizing radiation has toxicity in large doses, including cell death and damage, low-dose ionizing radiation has the opposite effect and positively regulates the hypersensitivity by mast cell activation. However, additional research is required using human mast cell lines and animal system to confirm these findings from the RBL-2H3 cells. We are currently working to confirm the effect of low-dose radiation in the human cell lines, HMC-1(5C6) and LAD2. We thank Dr. Meeseon Jeong for professional assistance in statistical analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2095150566,"Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) genes are fundamental components that contribute to adaptive immune responses. While characterization of the chromatin features at the core promoter region of these genes has been studied, the scope of histone modifications and the modifying factors responsible for activation of these genes are less well defined. Using the MHC-II gene HLA-DRA as a model, the extent and distribution of major histone modifications associated with active expression were defined in interferon-γ induced epithelial cells, B cells, and B-cell mutants for MHC-II expression. With active transcription, nucleosome density around the proximal regulatory region was diminished and histone acetylation and methylation modifications were distributed throughout the gene in distinct patterns that were dependent on the modification examined. Irrespective of the location, the majority of these modifications were dependent on the binding of either the X-box binding factor RFX or the class II transactivator (CIITA) to the proximal regulatory region. Importantly, once established, the modifications were stable through multiple cell divisions after the activating stimulus was removed, suggesting that activation of this system resulted in an epigenetic state. A dual crosslinking chromatin immunoprecipitation method was used to detect histone modifying protein components that interacted across the gene. Components of the MLL methyltransferase and GCN5 acetyltransferase complexes were identified. Some MLL complex components were found to be CIITA independent, including MLL1, ASH2L and RbBP5. Likewise, GCN5 containing acetyltransferase complex components belonging to the ATAC and STAGA complexes were also identified. These results suggest that multiple complexes are either used or are assembled as the gene is activated for expression. Together the results define and illustrate a complex network of histone modifying proteins and multisubunit complexes participating in MHC-II transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2042357345,"Background Vibrotactile discrimination tasks have been used to examine decision making processes in the presence of perceptual uncertainty, induced by barely discernible frequency differences between paired stimuli or by the presence of embedded noise. One lesser known property of such tasks is that decisions made on a single trial may be biased by information from prior trials. An example is the time-order effect whereby the presentation order of paired stimuli may introduce differences in accuracy. Subjects perform better when the first stimulus lies between the second stimulus and the global mean of all stimuli on the judged dimension (“preferred” time-orders) compared to the alternative presentation order (“nonpreferred” time-orders). This has been conceptualised as a “drift” of the first stimulus representation towards the global mean of the stimulus-set (an internal standard). We describe the influence of prior information in relation to the more traditionally studied factors of interest in a classic discrimination task. Methodology Sixty subjects performed a vibrotactile discrimination task with different levels of uncertainty parametrically induced by increasing task difficulty, aperiodic stimulus noise, and changing the task instructions whilst maintaining identical stimulus properties (the “context”). Principal Findings The time-order effect had a greater influence on task performance than two of the explicit factors–task difficulty and noise–but not context. The influence of prior information increased with the distance of the first stimulus from the global mean, suggesting that the “drift” velocity of the first stimulus towards the global mean representation was greater for these trials. Conclusions/Significance Awareness of the time-order effect and prior information in general is essential when studying perceptual decision making tasks. Implicit mechanisms may have a greater influence than the explicit factors under study. It also affords valuable insights into basic mechanisms of information accumulation, storage, sensory weighting, and processing in neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2058089229,"Combined pelvic floor electromyography (EMG) and videocystourethrography (VCUG) during urodynamic investigation are the most acceptable and widely agreed methods for diagnosing detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia (DESD). Theoretically, external urethral sphincter pressure (EUSP) measurement would provide enough information for the diagnosis of DESD and could simplify the urodynamic investigation replacing combined pelvic floor EMG and VCUG. Thus, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of EUSP measurement for DESD. PATIENTS #ENTITYSTARTX00026;A consecutive series of 72 patients (36 women, 36 men) with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction able to void spontaneously was prospectively evaluated at a single university spinal cord injury center. Diagnosis of DESD using EUSP measurement (index test) versus combined pelvic floor EMG and VCUG (reference standard) was assessed according to the recommendations of the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Initiative.Using EUSP measurement (index test) and combined pelvic floor EMG and VCUR (reference standard), DESD was diagnosed in 10 (14%) and in 41 (57%) patients, respectively. More than half of the patients presented discordant diagnosis between the index test and the reference standard. Among 41 patients with DESD diagnosed by combined pelvic floor EMG and VCUR, EUSP measurement identified only 6 patients. EUSP measurement had a sensitivity of 15% (95% CI 5%-25%), specificity of 87% (95% CI 76%-98%), positive predictive value of 60% (95% CI 30%-90%), and negative predictive value of 56% (95% CI 44%-68%) for the diagnosis of DESD.For diagnosis of DESD, EUSP measurement is inaccurate and cannot replace combined pelvic floor EMG and VCUR."
https://openalex.org/W2058562728,"Epitope mapping from affinity-selected peptides has become popular in epitope prediction, and correspondingly many Web-based tools have been developed in recent years. However, the performance of these tools varies in different circumstances. To address this problem, we employed an ensemble approach to incorporate two popular Web tools, MimoPro and Pep-3D-Search, together for taking advantages offered by both methods so as to give users more options for their specific purposes of epitope-peptide mapping. The combined operation of Union finds as many associated peptides as possible from both methods, which increases sensitivity in finding potential epitopic regions on a given antigen surface. The combined operation of Intersection achieves to some extent the mutual verification by the two methods and hence increases the likelihood of locating the genuine epitopic region on a given antigen in relation to the interacting peptides. The Consistency between Intersection and Union is an indirect sufficient condition to assess the likelihood of successful peptide-epitope mapping. On average from 27 tests, the combined operations of PepMapper outperformed either MimoPro or Pep-3D-Search alone. Therefore, PepMapper is another multipurpose mapping tool for epitope prediction from affinity-selected peptides. The Web server can be freely accessed at: http://informatics.nenu.edu.cn/PepMapper/"
https://openalex.org/W2052155108,"Bartonellae are hemotropic bacteria, agents of emerging zoonoses. These bacteria are heme auxotroph Alphaproteobacteria which must import heme for supporting their growth, as they cannot synthesize it. Therefore, Bartonella genome encodes for a complete heme uptake system allowing the transportation of this compound across the outer membrane, the periplasm and the inner membranes. Heme has been proposed to be used as an iron source for Bartonella since these bacteria do not synthesize a complete system required for iron Fe3+uptake. Similarly to other bacteria which use heme as an iron source, Bartonellae must transport this compound into the cytoplasm and degrade it to allow the release of iron from the tetrapyrrole ring. For Bartonella, the gene cluster devoted to the synthesis of the complete heme uptake system also contains a gene encoding for a polypeptide that shares homologies with heme trafficking or degrading enzymes. Using complementation of an E. coli mutant strain impaired in heme degradation, we demonstrated that HemS from Bartonella henselae expressed in E. coli allows the release of iron from heme. Purified HemS from B. henselae binds heme and can degrade it in the presence of a suitable electron donor, ascorbate or NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. Knocking down the expression of HemS in B. henselae reduces its ability to face H2O2 induced oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2088355769,"Accumulating evidence suggests that natural killer (NK) cells may have an important role in HIV-1 disease pathogenesis; however, in vivo studies are lacking. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection of cats provides a valuable model to study NK cell function in vivo. The immune response against Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is well characterized, allowing its use as an innate immune probe. We have previously shown that locally delivered IL-15 can improve Lm clearance in FIV-infected animals, and this correlated with an increase in NK cell number. In the present study, chronically FIV-infected and SPF-control cats were challenged with Lm by unilateral subcutaneous injection next to the footpad and then treated with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU). The Lm draining and contralateral control lymph nodes were evaluated for NK, NKT, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell number, proliferation, apoptosis, and NK cell function. Listeria monocytogenes burden was also assessed in both control and Lm draining lymph nodes. NK, NKT, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells in the Lm-challenged lymph node of FIV-infected cats did not increase in number. In addition, after Lm challenge, NK cells from FIV-infected cats did not increase their proliferation rate, apoptosis was elevated, and perforin expression was not upregulated when compared to SPF-control cats. The failure of the NK cell response against Lm challenge in the draining lymph node of FIV-infected cats correlates with the delayed control and clearance of this opportunistic bacterial pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2054734318,"It has been emphasized that chronic generalized immune dysfunction is the leading event in the pathogenesis of HIV infection, in which the contribution of dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) should not be underestimated. In current study, we assessed the longitudinal changes of peripheral blood DC subsets and Tregs in chronically asymptomatic treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients during 60 weeks of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and compared with those in healthy controls and long term non-progressors (LTNPs). Blood samples were collected at week 0, 4, 12, 24, 48 and 60 of treatment to measure the counts of DC subsets and Tregs by flow cytometry and IFN-a plasma levels by ELISA. The counts of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) increased during ART, reaching similar levels to healthy controls at week 60 post ART but still lower than those of LTNPs. In HIV-1-infected patients, the mDCs counts were directly correlated with CD4 counts during ART. Changes in mDCs at week 8 were positively correlated with the changes in CD4 counts at week 60 post ART. However, the counts and function of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) remained relatively stable during ART, and similar to those in healthy controls and LTNPs. The percentage of Tregs increased before ART and normalized after ART. Importantly, we found pDCs counts were associated with percentage of Tregs during ART, which may help in understanding of the role of these cells in HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2095401207,"The membrane protein prestin is native to the cochlear outer hair cell that is crucial to the ear's amplification and frequency selectivity throughout the whole acoustic frequency range. The outer hair cell exhibits interrelated dimensional changes, force generation, and electric charge transfer. Cells transfected with prestin acquire unique active properties similar to those in the native cell that have also been useful in understanding the process. Here we propose a model describing the major electromechanical features of such active membranes. The model derived from thermodynamic principles is in the form of integral relationships between the history of voltage and membrane resultants as independent variables and the charge density and strains as dependent variables. The proposed model is applied to the analysis of an active force produced by the outer hair cell in response to a harmonic electric field. Our analysis reveals the mechanism of the outer hair cell active (isometric) force having an almost constant amplitude and phase up to 80 kHz. We found that the frequency-invariance of the force is a result of interplay between the electrical filtering associated with prestin and power law viscoelasticity of the surrounding membrane. Paradoxically, the membrane viscoelasticity boosts the force balancing the electrical filtering effect. We also consider various modes of electromechanical coupling in membrane with prestin associated with mechanical perturbations in the cell. We consider pressure or strains applied step-wise or at a constant rate and compute the time course of the resulting electric charge. The results obtained here are important for the analysis of electromechanical properties of membranes, cells, and biological materials as well as for a better understanding of the mechanism of hearing and the role of the protein prestin in this mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2001209446,"Calcium (Ca+2) is a ubiquitous messenger in eukaryotes including Caenorhabditis. Ca+2-mediated signalling processes are usually carried out through well characterized proteins like calmodulin (CaM) and other Ca+2 binding proteins (CaBP). These proteins interact with different targets and activate it by bringing conformational changes. Majority of the EF-hand proteins in Caenorhabditis contain Ca+2 binding motifs. Here, we have performed homology modelling of CaM-like proteins using the crystal structure of Drosophila melanogaster CaM as a template. Molecular docking was applied to explore the binding mechanism of CaM-like proteins and IQ1 motif which is a ∼25 residues and conform to the consensus sequence (I, L, V)QXXXRXXXX(R,K) to serve as a binding site for different EF hand proteins. We made an attempt to identify all the EF-hand (a helix-loop-helix structure characterized by a 12 residues loop sequence involved in metal coordination) containing proteins and their Ca+2 binding affinity in Caenorhabditis by analysing the complete genome sequence. Docking studies revealed that F165, F169, L29, E33, F44, L57, M61, M96, M97, M108, G65, V115, F93, N104, E144 of CaM-like protein is involved in the interaction with IQ1 motif. A maximum of 170 EF-hand proteins and 39 non-EF-hand proteins with Ca+2/metal binding motif were identified. Diverse proteins including enzyme, transcription, translation and large number of unknown proteins have one or more putative EF-hands. Phylogenetic analysis revealed seven major classes/groups that contain some families of proteins. Various domains that we identified in the EF-hand proteins (uncharacterized) would help in elucidating their functions. It is the first report of its kind where calcium binding loop sequences of EF-hand proteins were analyzed to decipher their calcium affinities. Variation in Ca+2-binding affinity of EF-hand CaBP could be further used to study the behaviour of these proteins. Our analyses postulated that Ca+2 is likely to be key player in Caenorhabditis cell signalling."
https://openalex.org/W1976220807,"Background Factors affecting the efficacy of platelet and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have not been studied extensively. We aimed to evaluate platelet and RBC transfusion efficacy by measuring the platelet corrected count increment and the hemoglobin increment, respectively, 24 h after transfusion in 105 patients who received HSCT. Methodology/Principal Findings Using retrospective analysis, we studied whether factors, including gender, time of transplantation, the compatibility of ABO group between HSC donors and recipients, and autologous or allogenic transplantation, influence the efficacy of blood component transfusion. We found that the infection rate of HSCT patients positively correlated with the transfusion amount, and the length of stay in the laminar flow room was associated with transfusion. We found that platelet transfusion performed during HSCT showed significantly better efficacy than that performed before HSCT. The effect of platelet transfusion in auto-transplantation was significantly better than that in allo-transplantation. The efficacy of RBC transfusion during HSCT was significantly lower than that performed before HSCT. The efficacy of RBC transfusion in auto-transplantation was significantly higher than that in allo-transplantation. Allo-transplantation patients who received HSCs from compatible ABO groups showed significantly higher efficacy during both platelet and RBC transfusion. Conclusions We conclude that the efficacy of platelet and RBC transfusions does not correlate with the gender of patients, while it significantly correlates with the time of transplantation, type of transplantation, and ABO compatibility between HSC donors and recipients. During HSCT, the infection rate of patients positively correlates with the transfusion amount of RBCs and platelets. The total volume of RBC units transfused positively correlates with the length of the patients’ stay in the laminar flow room."
https://openalex.org/W2015176491,"Workstations and electronic display devices in a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) provide a convenient and efficient platform for medical diagnosis. The performance of display devices has to be verified to ensure that image quality is not degraded. In this study, we designed a set of randomized object test patterns (ROTPs) consisting of randomly located spheres with various image characteristics to evaluate the performance of a 2.5 mega-pixel (MP) commercial color LCD and a 3 MP diagnostic monochrome LCD in several aspects, including the contrast, resolution, point spread effect, and noise. The ROTPs were then merged into 120 abdominal CT images. Five radiologists were invited to review the CT images, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was carried out using a five-point rating scale. In the high background patterns of ROTPs, the sensitivity performance was comparable between both monitors in terms of contrast and resolution, whereas, in the low background patterns, the performance of the commercial color LCD was significantly poorer than that of the diagnostic monochrome LCD in all aspects. The average area under the ROC curve (AUC) for reviewing abdominal CT images was 0.717±0.0200 and 0.740±0.0195 for the color monitor and the diagnostic monitor, respectively. The observation time (OT) was 145±27.6 min and 127±19.3 min, respectively. No significant differences appeared in AUC (p = 0.265) and OT (p = 0.07). The overall results indicate that ROTPs can be implemented as a quality control tool to evaluate the intrinsic characteristics of display devices. Although there is still a gap in technology between different types of LCDs, commercial color LCDs could replace diagnostic monochrome LCDs as a platform for reviewing abdominal CT images after monitor calibration."
https://openalex.org/W2063227331,"HIV infection usually leads to a progressive decline in number and functionality of CD4+ T lymphocytes, resulting in AIDS development. In this study, I investigated the strategy of using inoculated SupT1 cells to move infection from HIV-1 X4 strains toward the inoculated cells, which should theoretically prevent infection and depletion of normal CD4+ T cells, preventing the development of AIDS-related pathologies. Interestingly, the persistent in vitro replication in SupT1 cells renders the virus less cytopathic and more sensitive to antibody-mediated neutralization, suggesting that replication of the virus in the inoculated SupT1 cells may have a vaccination effect in the long run. In order to mimic the scenario of a therapy in which SupT1 cells are inoculated in an HIV-seropositive patient, I used infected SupT1/PBMC cocultures and a series of control experiments. Infections were done with equal amounts of the wild type HIV-1 LAI virus. The SupT1 CD4+CD8+ T cell population was distinguished from the PBMC CD4+CD8− T cell population by FACS analysis. The results of this study show that the virus-mediated killing of primary CD4+ T cells in the SupT1/PBMC cocultures was significantly delayed, suggesting that the preferential infection of SupT1 cells can induce the virus to spare primary CD4+ T cells from infection and depletion. The preferential infection of SupT1 cells can be explained by the higher viral tropism for the SupT1 cell line. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that it's possible in an in vitro system to use SupT1 cells to prevent HIV infection of primary CD4+ T cells, suggesting that further exploration of the SupT1 cell line as a cell-based therapy against HIV-1 may prove worthwhile."
