https://openalex.org/W2036968376,"The neural basis of pattern recognition is a central problem in visual neuroscience. Responses of single cells were recorded in area V4 of macaque monkey to three classes of periodic stimuli that are based on spatial derivative operators: polar (concentric and radial), hyperbolic, and conventional sinusoidal (Cartesian) gratings. Of 118 cells tested, 16 percent responded significantly more to polar or hyperbolic (non-Cartesian) gratings than to Cartesian gratings and only 8 percent showed a significant preference for Cartesian gratings. Among cells selective for non-Cartesian gratings, those that preferred concentric gratings were most common. Cells selective for non-Cartesian gratings may constitute an important intermediate stage in pattern recognition and the representation of surface shape."

However, with the use of polymerase chain reaction-based DNA differentiation tests, allozymic frequency analyses, crossing experiments, and mating behavior studies, the introduced whitefly is found to be a distinct species. Recognition of this new species, the silverleaf whitefly, is critical in the search for management options."
https://openalex.org/W2076479500,"Rat C6 glioma cells express insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and form rapidly growing tumors in syngeneic animals. When transfected with an episome-based vector encoding antisense IGF-I complementary DNA, these cells lost tumorigenicity. Subcutaneous injection of IGF-I antisense-transfected C6 cells into rats prevented formation of both subcutaneous tumors and brain tumors induced by nontransfected C6 cells. The antisense-transfected cells also caused regression of established brain glioblastomas when injected at a point distal to the tumor. These antitumor effects result from a glioma-specific immune response involving CD8+ lymphocytes. Antisense blocking of IGF-I expression may reverse a phenotype that allows C6 glioma cells to evade the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2061154169,"The tumor suppressor p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein with characteristics of a transcription factor. It displays sequence-specific DNA binding, contains a potent transactivation domain, and has been implicated as both a transcriptional activator and a repressor. Transcription of the human hsp70 gene is stimulated by adenovirus E1a protein. This E1a transactivation of the hsp70 promoter is mediated by CCAAT binding factor (CBF). It is demonstrated here that p53 both represses transcription from the human hsp70 promoter and also interacts with CBF. Thus, the repression of the hsp70 promoter by p53 may be mediated by direct protein-protein interaction with CBF. These results suggest that protein-protein interaction between p53 and specific transcription factors may be an additional mechanism by which p53 regulates gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2057858723,"A myelin-associated protein from the central nervous system, the neurite growth inhibitor NI-35, inhibits regeneration of lesioned neuronal fiber tracts in vivo and growth of neurites in vitro. Growth cones of cultured rat dorsal root ganglion neurons arrested their growth and collapsed when exposed to liposomes containing NI-35. Before morphological changes, the concentration of free intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) showed a rapid and large increase in growth cones exposed to liposomes containing NI-35. Neither an increase in [Ca2+]i nor collapse of growth cones was detected in the presence of antibodies to NI-35. Dantrolene, an inhibitor of calcium release from caffeine-sensitive intracellular calcium stores, protected growth cones from collapse evoked by NI-35. Depletion of these caffeine-sensitive intracellular calcium stores prevented the increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by NI-35. The NI-35-evoked cascade of intracellular messengers that mediates collapse of growth cones includes the crucial step of calcium release from intracellular stores."
https://openalex.org/W1535774104,"Type I and type II adenylylcyclases have been purified after expression in Sf9 cells, each by application of a two-step purification protocol. The specific activities of the essentially homogeneous enzymes are approximately 7 and 2 mumol.min-1.mg-1, respectively. Each purified enzyme preparation is activated by Gs alpha, but they are regulated in an opposite fashion by G protein beta gamma subunits. Purified beta gamma inhibits Gs alpha-stimulated type I adenylylcyclase directly, while beta gamma activates type II adenylylcyclase and potentiates the Gs alpha-mediated stimulation of the enzyme. This is the first demonstration of the activation of a purified effector molecule by G protein beta gamma subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1593223362,"Heat shock proteins of the 82-90 kDa class (hsp82 and hsp90) are abundant, conserved, and ubiquitous from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Although proposed to be chaperones, they had not been reported to possess enzymatic activity until our recent observation that pure trypanosomatid hsp83 had potent ATPase activity (Nadeau, K., Sullivan, M., Engman, D., and Walsh, C. T. (1992) Protein Sci. 1, 970-979). We have now purified the hsp90 homolog from Escherichia coli (HtpG) and from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (hsp82) to homogeneity and observe ATPase activity with kcat values of 3 min-1 and 140 min-1. In addition, examinations of purified rat hsp90 and human hsp90 detect ATPase activity with a kcat of 0.6 min-1 and 10 min-1. Each of these hsp90s undergoes autophosphorylation on serine or threonine residues. In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the induction of hsps during heat shock is controlled, respectively, by the binding of an alternate sigma 32 or a transcriptional activator (heat shock factor or HSF) at heat shock promoter elements. Here we show that E. coli HtpG immobilized to Affi-Gel beads selectively retains sigma 32 while the yeast hsp90 and rat hsp90 retain HSF. The peptidyl prolyl isomerase hsp59 of the FK506 binding class is known to bind to hsp90. We also detect binding of the other family of PPIases, the cyclophilins, to immobilized hsp90, consistent with a functional convergence of protein foldases."
https://openalex.org/W2073569988,"During development, motion of nerve growth cones ceases on contact with particular targets. The signaling mechanism is unknown. In culture, growth cone collapse can be caused by solubilized embryonic brain membranes, central nervous system myelin, a 35-kilodalton protein isolated from myelin, and mastoparan. Collapse induced by each of these is blocked by pertussis toxin. Thus, collapse of growth cones is mediated by G protein-coupled receptors, which may be activated by proteins associated with the cell surface as well as by soluble ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1483803290,"Tau protein is an integral component of paired helical filaments, a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease. tau extracted from these filaments displays decreased electrophoretic mobility due to aberrant phosphorylation. Here we show that recombinant human tau can be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase resulting in decreased electrophoretic mobility. Phosphorylation of tau by cAMP-dependent protein kinase caused a 92% decrease in the maximum rate of tau-induced microtubule assembly. The sites of phosphorylation were identified by digesting phosphorylated tau with proteases, separating the peptides by reversed-phase HPLC, and analyzing the isolated peptides by liquid-secondary ion mass spectrometry and solid-phase N-terminal sequencing. Five phosphorylation sites were identified, two of which were located within microtubule binding domains. One site was previously shown to be the sole phosphorylation site for CaM kinase II; phosphorylation at this site by CaM kinase II was sufficient to cause decreased electrophoretic mobility (Steiner, B., Mandelkow, E. M., Biernat, J., Gustke, N., Meyer, H. E., Schmidt, B., Mieskes, G., Soling, H. D., Drechsel, D., Kirschner, M. W., Goedert, M., and Mandelkow, E. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 3539-3544). Thus two different second messenger-dependent protein kinases can phosphorylate tau at the same site and induce a shift in tau mobility like that seen in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1599706474,"This paper reports an investigation on the regulation of the mitochondrial cyclosporin A-sensitive permeability transition pore (MTP). Energized, coupled rat liver mitochondria incubated in sucrose medium in the presence of phosphate maintain a high proton electrochemical gradient (delta microH) and a low permeability to solutes. Addition of a small (10-20 microM) Ca2+ pulse leads to a transient membrane depolarization. After Ca2+ accumulation, a high delta microH is recovered, and mitochondria remain coupled indefinitely. Yet, addition of fully uncoupling concentrations of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP) brings about MTP opening within seconds. This finding confirms that MTP opening is the consequence rather than the cause of membrane depolarization, and allowed us to study the operation of the MTP in a synchronized population of mitochondria, since pore opening can be triggered by the addition of uncoupler under a series of experimental conditions. We find that three regulatory sites can be defined: (i) an internal Me2+ binding site: when this site is occupied by Ca2+, the pore probability increases, while other Me2+ ions (Sr2+, Mn2+) have an inhibitory effect; (ii) an external Me2+ binding site: when this site is occupied by Me2+ ions, including Ca2+, the pore open probability decreases; (iii) an independent cyclosporin A binding site: when this site is occupied by cyclosporin A the pore open probability decreases. We show that at variance from the case of cyclosporin A, MTP inhibition by the phospholipase A2 inhibitors nupercaine and trifluoperazine is Ca(2+)-competitive and is presumably related to interference by these drugs with Ca2+ binding to the internal regulatory site."
https://openalex.org/W1519218889,"The SRS2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was identified through mutational analysis as a suppressor of radiation-sensitive mutations in the error-prone repair pathway and by a hyper-recombination phenotype. Comparison of the derived amino acid sequence revealed the gene to have high homology to the bacterial DNA helicases UvrD and Rep (Aboussekhra, A., Chanet, R., Zgaga, Z., Cassier-Chauvat, C., Heude, M., and Fabre, F. (1989) Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 7211-7219). We have purified the SRS2 protein from Escherichia coli extracts by tagging the SRS2 gene with 6 carboxyl-terminal histidine residues and overexpressing the tagged protein in a pET-3c vector. Extracts were passed over a metal-chelating affinity chromatography column followed by gel filtration to obtain an enriched protein fraction. Sephacryl gel filtration of pooled fractions containing the SRS2 protein yielded purified SRS2 protein by Coomassie Blue stain of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. The purified SRS2 protein was found to have in vitro DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase activities. The polarity of the helicase activity was determined to be 3‘ to 5‘, the same polarity as that found for the UvrD and Rep proteins. The carboxyl-terminal region of the protein is shown to contain a sequence for nuclear localization. Expression of the SRS2 in yeast was examined and found to be extremely low."
https://openalex.org/W1871651935,"The regulation of the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex is essential for control of the hemostatic response. However, the role of the inhibitor antithrombin III in the regulation of factor VIIa has remained in question. The inhibition of factor VIIa activity by antithrombin III and heparin in the presence and absence of tissue factor was evaluated using the fluorescent substrate m-LGR-nds. Our data show that the activity of recombinant human factor VIIa is inhibited by antithrombin III in the presence of heparin at a rate of 1.7 x 10(2) M-1 s-1. In the presence of tissue factor, the rate constant for this reaction increases to 5.6 x 10(3) M-1 s-1. A 1:1 stoichiometric complex between factor VIIa and antithrombin III, with an apparent molecular weight of 110,000, was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A heterogeneous mixture of factor VIIa products with molecular weights between 50,000 and 80,000, most likely representing proteolytically degraded factor VIIa-antithrombin III complexes, was also observed."
https://openalex.org/W1591948006,"The majority of the GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily hydrolyze GTP to GDP very slowly. A notable exception to this are the Rac proteins, which have intrinsic GTPase rates at least 50-fold those of Ras or Rho. A protein (or proteins) capable of inhibiting this GTPase activity exists in human neutrophil cytosol. Since Rac appears to exist normally in neutrophils as a cytosolic protein complexed to (Rho)GDI, we examined the ability of (Rho)GDI to inhibit GTP hydrolysis by Rac. (Rho)GDI produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of GTP hydrolysis by Rac1 that paralleled its ability to inhibit GDP dissociation from the Rac protein. Maximal inhibition occurred at or near equimolar concentrations of the GDI and the Rac substrate. The ability of two molecules exhibiting GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rac to stimulate GTP hydrolysis was also inhibited by the presence of (Rho)GDI. The inhibitory effect of the GDI could be overcome by increasing the GAP concentration to levels equal to that of the GDI. (Rho)GDI weakly, but consistently, inhibited GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate) dissociation from Rac1, confirming an interaction of (Rho)GDI with the GTP-bound form of the protein. These data describe an additional activity of (Rho)GDI and suggest a mechanism by which Rac might be maintained in an active form in vivo in the presence of regulatory GAPs."
https://openalex.org/W1551420438,"The mRNA encoding S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) has a 330-nucleotide 5'-transcript leader containing an open reading frame (uORF) that codes for the hexapeptide MAGDIS. The uORF restricts the intracellular distribution of AdoMetDC mRNA primarily to monosomes in normal T-lymphocytes and in T-cell lines. In contrast, non-lymphoid cells normally carry an average of seven to nine ribosomes per AdoMetDC mRNA molecule (Hill, J.R., and Morris, D. R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21886-21893). Several alterations abolish the negative regulatory effect of the uORF in T-cells. These include removing the site of translational initiation; weakening the context of the translational initiation site; changing the coding capacity of the fourth, fifth, and sixth codons; increasing the length of the uORF at either the 5' or 3' end; or changing the primary order of the codons. In contrast, altering the nucleic acid sequence of the uORF at degenerative positions without changing the amino acid coding capacity did not cause deregulation. The uORF does not regulate translation in the trans-configuration. Our results support a model in which translation of the uORF generates a nascent hexapeptide that interacts with its translating ribosome to suppress translation of AdoMetDC mRNA in a cell-specific manner. Structural features of the carboxyl-terminal 3 amino acids of the putative hexapeptide govern the interaction of the peptide with a component of the translation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2091171997,"T cell receptor (TCR) vaccination in rats prevents the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. The mechanism of this potential immunotherapy was examined by vaccinating mice with an immunogenic peptide fragment of the variable region of the TCR V beta 8.2 gene. Another immunogen that usually induces an immune response mediated by V beta 8.2+ T cells was subsequently inhibited because specific clonal unresponsiveness (anergy) had been induced. Depletion of CD8+ cells before TCR peptide vaccination blocked such inhibition. Thus, the clonal anergy was dependent on CD8+ T cells, and such immunoregulatory T cells may participate in the normal course of EAE."

https://openalex.org/W1510047882,"The localization of ubiquinone (UQ) and plastoquinone (PQ) biosynthesis in subfractions isolated from spinach leaves has been studied. UQ-9 and UQ-10 were found mainly in mitochondria, whereas PQ was enriched in chloroplasts, but also found in Golgi membranes. alpha-Unsaturated polyprenol-11 was also present at a low concentration in chloroplasts. Autoradiography revealed the presence of nonaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (NPHB) and nonaprenyl-2-methylquinol (NPMQ) transferase activities involved in quinone biosynthesis in all subfractions, but the specific activities involved in quinone biosynthesis in the total microsomal fraction were 20 times higher than those in mitochondria and chloroplasts. The isolated Golgi vesicles were particularly enriched in both activities. When the incubation medium containing total microsomes or Golgi membranes was supplemented with NADH, NADPH, S-adenosylmethionine, and an ATP-generating system, NPHB and NPMQ were transferred to UQ-9 and PQ, respectively. trans-Prenyltransferase, which synthesizes the side chain of UQ and PQ, was present in the total microsomal fraction. With farnesyl-PP as substrate, no product was formed, but with geranyl-PP, solanesyl-PP was synthesized and transferred to 4-hydroxybenzoate present in the total microsomal fraction. The results show that these membranes from spinach contain farnesyl-PP synthetase. It is concluded that the plant leaf Golgi membranes contain the enzymes for both UQ and PQ biosynthesis and that a specific transport and targeting system is required for selective transfer of UQ to the mitochondria and of PQ to the chloroplast."
https://openalex.org/W1560137837,"Cathepsin L is a lysosomal cysteine protease whose expression and secretion is induced by malignant transformation, growth factors, and tumor promoters. Many human tumors express high levels of cathepsin L, which is a broad spectrum protease with potent elastase and collagenase activities. Two published human cathepsin L cDNA sequences differ only in their 5'-untranslated regions. In this study, we demonstrate the concurrent expression of two distinct human cathepsin L mRNAs (hCATL-A and hCATL-B) in adenocarcinoma, hepatoma, and renal cancer cell lines. Cloning of the human cathepsin L gene by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and subsequent sequencing reveals that hCATL-A and hCATL-B mRNAs are encoded by a single gene. The 3' end of the first intron contains the 5' portion of hCATL-B and is contiguous to the second exon of the gene. These data suggest either the possibility of alternative splicing or the presence of a second promoter within the first intron of the hCATL gene. We mapped the hCATL gene to chromosome 9q21-22. Sequencing of both the mouse and human cathepsin L genes demonstrates almost complete conservation of exon and intron position, but significant divergence in intron structure, possibly reflecting differences in regulation of expression of the mouse and human cathepsin L genes."
https://openalex.org/W1582199693,"The hepatitis B virus core gene codes for two polypeptides: the core protein, which assembles to form particles (HBcAg), and the secreted precore protein (HBeAg). Expression vectors directing the synthesis in Escherichia coli of a recombinant HBeAg corresponding in sequence to serum-derived HBeAg encompassing the 10 precore amino acids remaining after cleavage of the precursor and residues 1-149 of HBcAg (PC-HBeAg) were constructed. Recombinant PC-HBeAg, HBcAg, and C-terminally truncated HBcAg were isolated from E. coli and analyzed by sucrose velocity sedimentation, electron microscopy, anti-HBc/e specific monoclonal antibody analysis, and for immunogenicity. HBcAg and truncated HBcAg formed 27-nm particles and displayed HBc antigenicity. In contrast, PC-HBeAg was nonparticulate and did not band in sucrose gradients. PC-HBeAg was recognized efficiently by HBeAg-specific antibodies and displayed little HBc antigenicity. Immunogenicity studies including T and B cell recognition confirmed that PC-HBeAg demonstrates HBe antigenicity. The presence of the 10 precore amino acids therefore prevented particle formation. To analyze which precore amino acids might be responsible for the prevention of particle formation a cysteine to glutamine substitution at amino acid position -7 was introduced into PC-HBeAg (-7C-->Q)PC-HBeAg. This single amino acid change at position -7 restored particle formation and HBc antigenicity. The evolutionarily conserved cysteine at position -7 thus appears responsible for the prevention of particle assembly in the HBeAg biosynthesis pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1589729211,"Melanoma growth-stimulatory activity (MGSA)/GRO is well characterized as a potent neutrophil chemoattractant. In the present study, we have demonstrated that MGSA induced a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of interstitial collagens by rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts. The decrease was observed over a dose range of 0.6-6.0 nM MGSA. This effect was specific, as MGSA had no demonstrable effect on the expression of collagen-degrading metalloproteinases, nor did it affect the collagenase inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. It also had no effect on the proliferation rate of these fibroblasts, unlike its mitogenic effect on melanoma cells. The ability to inhibit collagen expression was also demonstrated by another member of the C-X-C branch of the platelet factor 4 superfamily, interleukin-8 (IL-8), but not by RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, or MIP-1 beta, which belong to the C-C branch. Steady-state levels of expression of MGSA and IL-8 transcripts in normal adult tissues were dissimilar, suggesting that expression may be an important level at which the activity of these cytokines is regulated. Direct binding experiments with 125I-MGSA on synovial fibroblasts have allowed us to identify an MGSA receptor with a KD of 10.1 nM and approximately 75,000 binding sites/fibroblast. 125I-MGSA binding was specific and could not be displaced by unlabeled IL-8. These results suggest that MGSA, as well as IL-8, may play a role other than that of neutrophil chemo-attractant and more specifically, may be important in the regulation of collagen turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1514367239,"The GEO colon carcinoma cell line is weakly tumorigenic in athymic mice and shows differentiated properties both in tissue culture and in xenografts. Proliferating monolayer cultures of GEO cells which normally require exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) for optimal growth displayed a marked inhibition in growth upon addition of antibodies that block binding to the EGF receptor or neutralize TGF-alpha. These results indicated that GEO cells utilize TGF-alpha in a weak autocrine loop. The availability of a weakly malignant model system in which TGF-alpha had demonstrable, but low level autocrine activity, permitted the investigation of the role of TGF-alpha in tumorigenesis by generating a stronger autocrine loop through the overexpression of the polypeptide. GEO cells were electroporated with an expression vector containing the human TGF-alpha cDNA, and stable clones were isolated that constitutively expressed the TGF-alpha cDNA in a strong autocrine loop. However, the growth rate of the parental cells in EGF-supplemented medium was the same as that of transfected cells with or without growth factor-supplemented medium. Thus, any biological changes generated by the overexpression of TGF-alpha were due to the autocrine nature of the growth mechanism rather than due to any decrease in doubling time leading to a faster growth rate. Transfected GEO cells showed an increase in anchorage-independent growth and formed tumors more readily in athymic nude mice indicating that TGF-alpha plays a role in progression of transformed properties."
https://openalex.org/W1546294341,"RNA polymerase II is a multisubunit enzyme composed of two large subunits of molecular weight in excess of 100,000 and a collection of 8-10 smaller subunits. The largest subunit, designated IIa, contains at its carboxyl terminus a highly repetitive domain consisting of tandem repeats of the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. Extensive phosphorylation within this COOH-terminal domain (CTD) gives rise to subunit IIo which has a markedly reduced mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) relative to subunit IIa. Recent evidence suggests that RNA polymerase IIA, containing an unphosphorylated CTD, is involved in preinitiation complex assembly, whereas RNA polymerase IIO is involved in elongation. Consequently, CTD phosphorylation is thought to occur after RNA polymerase II has bound to the promoter by a protein kinase that stably associates with the preinitiation complex. We present here the partial purification and characterization of two distinct CTD kinases from a HeLa cell transcription extract. These CTD kinases, designated CTDK1 and CTDK2, are fractionated by chromatography on Mono Q. CTDK1 catalyzes the incorporation of approximately 33 pmol of phosphate/pmol of calf thymus RNA polymerase subunit IIa, almost exclusively on serine. CTDK2 catalyzes the incorporation of approximately 50 pmol of phosphate/pmol of calf thymus subunit IIa, predominantly on serine; appreciable phosphate transfer onto threonine is also observed. Phosphorylation by CTDK2, but not CTDK1, results in a complete mobility shift in SDS-PAGE of subunit IIa to the position of IIo. CTDK1 can utilize ATP, dATP, or GTP as phosphate donor, whereas CTDK2 can utilize only ATP or dATP. The apparent Km for ATP is 30 microM for CTDK1 and 60 microM for CTDK2. CTDK1 and CTDK2 also differ in their protein substrate specificity. CTDK1 phosphorylates casein whereas CTDK2 does not. Neither kinase phosphorylates phosvitin or histone H1 to an appreciable extent. CTDK1 and CTDK2 do not appear to be related to cdc2 kinases as determined by their inability to phosphorylate H1 and their failure to react with antibodies directed against the cdc2 kinase. These results establish that a partially fractionated HeLa transcription extract contains two distinct CTD kinases that differ in their nucleotide requirements and in their patterns of CTD phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1556878161,"The expression and purification of the rabbit muscle aldolase A (D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate:D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate lyase, EC 4.1.2.13) from an expression plasmid in bacteria is described. The enzyme is produced in bacteria at a level of 300 mg/liter and is indistinguishable from the enzyme isolated from muscle in assays using fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 1-phosphate. The recombinant enzyme has the same primary, secondary, and quaternary structure as the muscle enzyme. Aspartic acid 33, found near the active site lysine in the crystal structure, is changed to alanine, serine, and glutamic acid by site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in the mutant proteins, D33A, D33S, and D33E, respectively. The mutant enzymes are purified by substrate affinity elution from carboxylmethyl-Sepharose, the same method as that used for the wild-type enzyme. The secondary and quaternary structure of D33A is identical to wild-type aldolase when analyzed by light scattering, gel filtration, and circular dichroism. Moreover, the hexose substrate can be fixed in the active site by reduction of the Schiff base with sodium borohydride, indicating that the active site is not drastically altered. These single mutations in the active site have a serious effect on the activity of the enzyme. In addition, the rate of carbanion oxidation for D33A is 17-29 times slower when the substrate is fructose 1,6-bisphosphate versus dihydroxyacetone phosphate, whereas in the wild-type there is no significant difference in these rates. This evidence and the conservation of this residue in other class I aldolases indicate that aspartic acid 33 is an essential residue in the catalytic mechanism, possibly involved in abstraction of the carbon 4 hydroxyl proton."
https://openalex.org/W1537627033,"The cellular localization of the origin of alpha-aminoadipate used in penicillin biosynthesis and the first enzymic step in Penicillium chrysogenum involved, delta-(alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase (ACVS), has been studied. Subcellular fractions were obtained from protoplasts of a high penicillin-producing strain upon lysis by Triton X-100, and vacuoles purified from them. They were identified by the aid of alpha-mannosidase as a marker enzyme, by the presence of polyphosphate, and their ability to sequester [14C]lysin, added to the protoplasts prior to subcellular fractionation. 15.6 and 26.5%, respectively, of 6-[14C]alpha-aminoadipate, and 8.5 and 10.3%, respectively, of [14C]valine added accordingly were also found in the vacuole, and the higher proportion was found in vacuoles isolated from penicillin-producing mycelia. ACVS protein was detected in the membrane as well as the soluble fraction of the purified vacuoles. We propose therefore that ACVS is located either within or bound to the vacuolar membrane, and that the precursor amino acids for penicillin biosynthesis are withdrawn from the vacuolar amino acid pool."
https://openalex.org/W1636853739,"Integration host factor protein (IHF) was shown to be required for Fnr- and NarL-dependent activation of the nitrate reductase (narGHJI) operon of Escherichia coli in response to nitrate availability and anaerobiosis. Using a narG-lacZ reporter fusion to evaluate narGHJI expression in vivo both the nitrate and anaerobic dependent controls were severely impaired in a himA mutant compared with the wild type strain. IHF was also required for Fnr-independent anaerobic control of narGHJI expression. In vitro, purified IHF protein was shown to bind to a narG promoter fragment with an apparent dissociation value of 5 nM by use of a gel shift assay. DNase I footprinting studies revealed that IHF protects a 37-base pair region centered 125 base pairs 5' of the narG transcription site. These studies suggest that the IHF protein performs a DNA bending function at the narG promoter to allow nitrate-dependent activation by the NarL regulatory protein, and second, it enhances the Fnr-dependent expression from the narG promoter under anaerobic cell growth conditions. A model whereby three transcriptional activators, NarL, IHF, and Fnr, induce expression of a sigma 70-dependent promoter for the narGHJI operon is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1598923468,"The direct effect of the eukaryotic nuclear DNA-binding protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase on the activity of DNA polymerase alpha was investigated. Homogenously purified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (5 to 10 micrograms/ml) stimulated the activity of immunoaffinity-purified calf or human DNA polymerase alpha by about 6 to 60-fold in a dose-dependent manner. It had no effect on the activities of DNA polymerase beta, DNA polymerase gamma, and primase, indicating that its effect is specific for DNA polymerase alpha. Apparently, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of DNA polymerase alpha was not necessary for the stimulation. The stimulatory activity is due to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase itself since it was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody directed against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Kinetic analysis showed that, in the presence of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, the saturation curve for DNA template primer became sigmoidal; at very low concentrations of DNA, it rather inhibited the reaction in competition with template DNA, while, at higher DNA doses, it greatly stimulated the reaction by increasing the Vmax of the reaction. By the automodification of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, however, both the inhibition at low DNA concentration and the stimulation at high DNA doses were largely lost. Furthermore, stimulation by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase could not be attributed to its DNA-binding function alone since its fragment, containing only the DNA-binding domain, could not exert full stimulatory effect on DNA polymerase, as of the intact enzyme. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is co-immunoprecipitated with DNA polymerase alpha, using anti-DNA polymerase alpha antibody, clearly showing that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase may be physically associated with DNA polymerase alpha. In a crude extract of calf thymus, a part of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity existed in a 400-kDa, as well as, a larger 700-kDa complex containing DNA polymerase alpha, suggesting the existence in vivo of a complex of these two enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1495877624,"The forward and reverse reactions for integration were characterized for the Moloney murine leukemia virus integrase (M-MuLV IN) protein. The M-MuLV IN was recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli, and was purified to greater than 90% homogeneity by a one-step affinity purification scheme. M-MuLV IN was highly active for integration as measured by in vitro cleavage and strand transfer assays. Furthermore, the integration of a model viral substrate into lambda concatamers by IN correctly produced the flanking 4-base pair duplications characteristic of M-MuLV IN. The reverse reaction of integration, disintegration, was also catalyzed by the recombinant M-MuLV IN. Two products were generated, a 3'-recessed long terminal repeat and a ligated target DNA, from a model integration-intermediate substrate in the presence of M-MuLV IN. The requirements and optimal conditions for maximal integration and disintegration activity for M-MuLV IN were determined. The forward and reverse reactions required different concentrations of manganese ion and reductant. Salt was also titrated for the forward and reverse reactions. Sodium chloride inhibited integration, but had little affect on disintegration. Low concentrations of potassium chloride enhanced integration, but had no affect on disintegration. The dinucleotide cleavage, strand transfer, and the disintegration reactions each had a unique pH profile of activity."
https://openalex.org/W1533933556,"Previous studies demonstrated that at least two mechanisms are involved in the epoxidation of styrene and stilbene by myoglobin and H2O2 (Ortiz de Montellano, P. R., and Catalano, C. E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9265-9271). One mechanism, reaction of the olefin with the ferryl oxygen, preserves the olefin stereochemistry and incorporates an oxygen from H2O2 into the epoxide. The second mechanism, proposed to be a protein-mediated co-oxidation process, results in loss of stereochemistry and incorporation of an atom of molecular oxygen. To examine the role of individual residues in olefin epoxidation, we have examined the catalytic activities of the possible Tyr-->Phe mutants, the His-64-->Val mutant, and a protein combining all the tyrosine and histidine mutations. The latter protein is less stable than the other mutants and is the only one for which a protein radical is not detected in the reaction with H2O2. The Km and Vmax for styrene epoxidation range, respectively, from 0.3-8 mM and 12-35 pmol/min/nmol of protein. Incubation with H(2)18O2 results in 20-30% incorporation of labeled oxygen into the epoxide with all the mutants except Y103F/Y151F, Y146F/Y151F, H64V, and H64V/Y103F/Y146F/Y151F, for which 52, 58, 89, and 96% of the epoxide oxygen, respectively, is labeled. Oxidation of cis-beta-methylstyrene by wild-type myoglobin yielded a 54:46 ratio of cis- and trans-beta-methylstyrene oxides. The cis-isomer accounts for 47-100% of the epoxide produced by the mutant hemoproteins, with the two H64V mutants yielding almost exclusively the cis-epoxide. The oxygen in the cis-epoxide derives primarily or exclusively from H2O2 and that in the trans-epoxide from an alternative source. These results indicate that tyrosine residues may participate in, but are not essential for, protein-mediated epoxidation. In contrast, His-64 appears to be essential for co-oxidative epoxidation because in its absence olefin epoxidation is mediated almost exclusively by ferryl oxygen transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1927629618,"The binding of [3H]inositol hexakisphosphate ([3H] InsP6) to rat cerebellar membranes has been characterized with the objective of establishing the role, if any, of a membrane protein receptor. In the presence of EDTA, we have previously identified an InsP6-binding site with a capacity of approximately 20 pmol/mg protein (Hawkins, P. T., Reynolds, D. J. M., Poyner, D. R., and Hanley, M. R. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 167, 819-827). However, in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+, the capacity of [3H]InsP6 binding to membranes was increased approximately 9-fold. This enhancing effect of Mg2+ was reversed by addition of 10 microM of several cation chelators, suggesting that the increased binding required trace quantities of other metal cations. This is supported by experiments where it was possible to saturate binding by addition of excess membranes, despite not significantly depleting radioligand, pointing to removal of some other factor. Removal of endogenous cations from the binding assay by pretreatment with chelex resin also prevents the Mg(2+)-induced potentiation. Consideration of the specificity of the chelators able to abolish this potentiation suggested involvement of Fe3+ or Al3+. Both these ions (but not several others) were able to increase [3H]InsP6 binding to chelex-pretreated membranes at concentrations of 1 microM. It is possible to demonstrate synergy between Fe3+ and Mg2+ under these conditions. We propose that [3H]InsP6 may interact with membranes through non-protein recognition, possibly via phospholipids, in a manner dependent upon trace metals. The implications of this for InsP6 biology are considered."
https://openalex.org/W1529741804,"Abstract beta-All-trans-retinoic acid (RA)-induced endodermal differentiation of mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells is accompanied by changes in glycoprotein glycosylation, including expression of i antigen (i.e. polylactosamine) and leukophytohemagglutinin-reactive oligosaccharides (i.e. -GlcNAc beta 1-6Man alpha 1-6-branched N-linked). We have used the F9 teratocarcinoma cells as a model to study developmental regulation of glycosyltransferase activities which are responsible for the biosynthesis of beta 1-6GlcNAc-branched N- and O-linked oligosaccharides and polylactosamine. Growth of F9 cells in the presence of 10(-6) M RA for 4 days increased core 2 GlcNAc transferase and GlcNAc transferase V activities by 13- and 6-fold, respectively, whereas the activities of GlcNAc transferase I, beta 1-3GlcNAc transferase (i), beta 1-4Gal transferase, and beta 1-3Gal transferase increased 2-4-fold. Induction of glycosyltransferase activities by RA was dose-dependent and showed a biphasic response with approximately half of the increase observed 3 days after RA treatment and the remainder occurred by day 4. PYS-2, a parietal endoderm cell line, showed levels of glycosyltransferase activities similar to those of RA-treated F9 cells. Glycosyltransferase activities in the RA-resistant F9 cell line (RA-3-10) were low and showed only a small induction by RA. These observations suggest that differentiation of F9 cells is closely associated with induction of multiple glycosyltransferase activities, with most pronounced increases in GlcNAc transferase V and 2',5'-tetradenylate (core 2) GlcNAc transferase. The increase in GlcNAc transferase V was also reflected by the 4-6-fold increase in the binding of 125I-leukophytohemagglutinin to several cellular glycoproteins, which occurred after 3 days of RA treatment. The endo-beta-galactosidase-sensitive polylactosamine content of membrane glycoproteins and, in particular, the LAMP-1 glycoprotein was markedly increased after RA treatment of F9 cells. Consistent with these observations, fucosylated polylactosamine (i.e. dimeric Lex) was also increased in RA-treated cells. Analysis of the aryl oligosaccharides produced by F9 cells cultured in the presence of aryl alpha-D-GalNAc showed that RA treatment enhanced the synthesis of disialyl core 2 O-linked oligosaccharides and increased the polylactosamine content of the aryl oligosaccharides by > 20-fold. The results suggest that differentiation of F9 cells into endoderm is closely associated with increased GlcNAc transferase V and core 2 GlcNAc transferase activities, enzymes which control the level of beta 1-6GlcNAc-branched N- and O-linked oligosaccharides, the preferred substrates for polylactosamine addition."
https://openalex.org/W1594906225,"We established the identity of a 52-kDa protein secreted by fetal lamb ductus arteriosus (DA) smooth muscle cells (SMC) and suggest how it might be related to structural changes unique to DA development, i.e. reduced assembly of elastic laminae and associated formation of intimal cushions. We produced a monoclonal antibody (HI-20) to the 52-kDa protein and observed, by electron microscopy, immunogold labeling of elastin in both DA and aorta vessel walls. Western immunoblotting showed that HI-20, as well as antibodies to tropoelastin, reacted with the 52-kDa protein secreted by DA SMC, as well as with 68-kDa tropoelastin. The highly specific antibody to the carboxyl-terminal sequence of tropoelastin failed, however, to recognize the 52-kDa protein, although it reacted well with the 68-kDa tropoelastin. Amino acid analysis and sequencing data confirmed the identity of the affinity-purified 52-kDa protein as truncated tropoelastin with an intact amino terminus. Cell-free translation of mRNA extracted from DA and aorta SMC produced a 68-kDa, but not a 52-kDa, immunoprecipitated tropoelastin. When DA and aorta SMC were pulsed with [14C]valine, we immunoprecipitated, after only a 15-min chase, both 68-kDa and 52-kDa tropoelastin from cell extracts of DA SMC, but only the 68-kDa tropoelastin was present in aorta SMC. There was no evidence of proteolytic degradation of radiolabeled aorta 68-kDa tropoelastin to a 52-kDa species when mixed with DA SMC conditioned medium. This suggests that the 52-kDa tropoelastin is the result of cell-associated processing or degradation of an original 68-kDa product of translation. Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments showed initial secretion of equivalent amounts of 68-kDa and 52-kDa tropoelastins by cultured DA SMC with increasing accumulation of the 52-kDa species, suggesting its impaired insolubilization. The production, in high concentration, of a 52-kDa tropoelastin product that lacks the carboxyl terminus, may prevent its alignment on the microfibrillar scaffold, resulting in abnormal assembly of elastic laminae in the DA. The accumulation of this soluble tropoelastin may be associated with the previously described property of chemotaxis resulting in the increased SMC migration into the subendothelium associated with DA intimal thickening."
https://openalex.org/W1498923699,"Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with a recombinant DNA containing the entire coding sequence of human lysosomal protective protein cDNA under the control of mouse metallothionein I promoter. Neomycin and methotrexate-resistant stably transformed cell lines expressing this protein were isolated. Immunoprecipitation of the product with antiserum against human placental protective protein-beta-galactosidase complex revealed a 52-kDa protective protein precursor, which was then processed to mature form, a heterodimer of 32- and 20-kDa polypeptides. The precursor secreted in the culture medium was taken up by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor system and restored acid carboxypeptidase, beta-galactosidase, and neuraminidase activities in galactosialidosis fibroblasts. The expressed protein showed a granular pattern in intracellular distribution, was fractionated at the density of lysosomes, and had serine esterase activities; acid carboxypeptidase at pH 5.6, esterase at pH 7.0, and carboxyl-terminal deamidase at pH 7.0. They were inhibited simultaneously by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, or iodoacetamide. The acid carboxypeptidase activity of the purified monomeric mature protective protein was labile in vitro under the acidic condition. Saposins (sphingolipid activator proteins) stabilized the activity at micromolar level concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2110918511,"m-Calpain (calpain II, m-CANP), which normally requires millimolar Ca2+ for activity in vitro, was capable of proteolyzing a number of matrix proteins in isolated rat liver nuclei at Ca2+ concentrations as low as 3 microM (Mellgren, R. L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 13920-13924). Treatment of nuclei with deoxyribonuclease I eliminated the activity of m-calpain at low Ca2+ concentrations, while ribonuclease A and phospholipase C had no effect. Addition of DNA to DNase-treated nuclei restored m-calpain activity at low Ca2+. RNA had little if any effect. Eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA were equally effective, and synthetic polydeoxyribonucleotides were also activators. m-Calpain did not bind to a DNA-cellulose column in the presence of 200 microM Ca2+, and m-calpain preincubated in the presence of DNA and 200 microM Ca2+ was not activated at low Ca2+ concentrations following removal of the DNA. DNA did not alter the Ca2+ requirement for m-calpain-catalyzed cleavage of casein. These results demonstrate that the Ca2+ requirement for proteolysis of nuclear matrix proteins by m-calpain can be dramatically decreased in the presence of DNA. Activation did not seem to be a result of DNA binding directly to calpain but appeared to require interaction of DNA, calpain, and calpain substrates in the nuclear matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1517630357,"Genetic evidence suggests that the Bacillus subtilis recR gene product is involved in DNA repair and recombination. To assign a biochemical function to the recR gene product, the RecR protein was labeled and purified by monitoring the radioactive label. NH2-terminal protein sequence analysis of RecR was consistent with the deduced amino acid sequence of the recR gene. The RecR protein (molecular mass of 25 kDa, isoelectric point 5.4) bound single- and double-stranded DNA in a filter binding assay. RecR-DNA complex formation is enhanced by the presence of a damage in the DNA substrate. The RecR-DNA complex formation proceeds in the absence of divalent cations and nucleotide cofactors, but is markedly stimulated by ATP and divalent cations. In our experimental conditions the apparent equilibrium constants of the optimized RecR-DNA complexes are 3 x 10(-7) M and 9 x 10(-7) M for damaged and undamaged DNA, respectively. The binding reaction is cooperative. Electron microscopy studies show that the presence of divalent cations increases the rate of RecR protein self-assembly. Addition of ATP or dATP promotes the organization of discrete series of quaternary structures on DNA, but ATP gamma S inhibits the DNA binding activity. A possible mechanism for the RecR function in DNA repair is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1585832473,"Abstract The intracellular concentration of ionized calcium is involved in regulating mitosis. However, little is known about intracellular levels of calcium during G1. We have demonstrated in vascular smooth muscle cells a mid-G1 decrease in ionized calcium concentration followed by a 2-fold rise at the G1/S interface (44 nM +/- 0.6 nM versus 98 nM +/- 1.1 nM, p < 0.01). The elevation of intracellular calcium is preceded by an increase in c-myb mRNA levels and is abolished with antisense but not missense c-myb oligonucleotides. Furthermore, cells stably transfected with c-myb show a similar 2-fold augmentation in intracellular calcium concentrations, as compared with untransfected cells, which is also abolished by antisense c-myb oligonucleotides. The c-myb-induced rise in intracellular calcium is dependent upon the presence of extracellular calcium and is not suppressed by L type calcium channel blockers. We conclude that c-myb induces an elevation in intracellular calcium levels of vascular smooth muscle cells at the G1/S interface which provides a novel role for this proto-oncogene as well as a potentially important control point for cell cycle regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1600072158,"G protein-mediated signal transduction is dependent on alpha subunit interactions with βy subunits, receptors, effectors, magnesium ions, and guanine nucleotides. The interdependence of these interactions can be probed by mutational analysis. We developed large scale screening procedures in recombinant Escherichia coli to identify and characterize novel mutations in Goα. Random mutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction in the amino-terminal 56 amino acids of Goα. Guanine nucleotide binding properties of the mutants were assayed in situ and in crude extracts of recombinant E. coli. βy interactions were assayed by pertussis toxin mediated ADP-ribosylation. Efficacy of the screening procedures was evaluated by studying properties of wild-type Goα and site-directed mutations that were characterized previously in other G proteins. Several novel mutants with altered GTP binding characteristics and reduced ability to interact with beta gamma had been isolated from the randomly generated mutant library. ADP-ribosylation of mutants R10G, K21N, and K35E was significantly reduced, whereas two of the mutants bearing multiple amino acid substitutions were refractory to modification. Mutant K35E also exhibited reduced affinity to guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate at submicromolar concentrations of magnesium. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using large scale random mutagenesis in the studies of G protein function."
https://openalex.org/W1541650158,"Fasciclin I is a lipid-linked cell-surface glycoprotein that can act as a homophilic adhesion molecule in tissue culture cells. It is thought to be involved in growth cone guidance in the embryonic insect nervous system. To facilitate structure-function studies, we have generated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing high levels of cell surface grasshopper and Drosophila fasciclin I. Grasshopper fasciclin I released by phospholipase C cleavage was purified on an immunoaffinity column and single crystals were obtained that diffracted to approximately 5-A resolution. We also generated CHO and Drosophila S2 cell lines that produce a secreted form of fasciclin I. Fasciclin I expressed in S2 cells contains significantly less carbohydrate than the protein expressed in CHO cells, and may therefore be more suitable for crystallization. Biochemical characterization of purified fasciclin I indicates that the extracellular portion exists as a monomer in solution. Circular dichroism studies suggest that fasciclin I is primarily alpha-helical. Its structure is therefore different from other known cell adhesion molecules, which are predicted to be elongated beta-sheet structures. This suggests that fasciclin I may define a new structural motif used to mediate adhesive interactions between cell surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1563607954,"Multiple, nonallelic forms of histone H1 are found in most mammalian tissues. Attempts to determine a functional significance to this diversity is hindered by a paucity of primary amino acid sequence data. Although numerous H1 genes have been cloned, the type of variant they encode cannot be determined by sequence analysis alone. We used transformation and overexpression methods to determine that two cloned mouse H1 genes, MH143 and MH175, encode H1c and H1e, respectively. Since these genes have been completely sequenced, these results establish the amino acid sequence of these variants. Assignment was accomplished by mutagenically tagging the genes by incorporation of a codon for methionine, which is not found in the major somatic H1 variants. These genes were placed under the control of the mouse metallothionein I promoter and introduced into 3T3 cells. Products of these mutagenized genes were detected by [35S]methionine labeling and identified by high performance liquid chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We were also able to induce major alterations in the normal stoichiometry of chromatin-associated H1 variants through overproduction of H1c and H1e. This had little effect on the growth properties of these transformants."
https://openalex.org/W1487489831,"Mutant a and alpha yeast cells were created with histone H3 containing cysteine in place of alanine 110. Because transcriptionally active nucleosomes unfold to reveal the histone H3-thiol groups at the center of the core, the active nucleosomes of the mutant strain can be isolated by mercury-affinity chromatography. We compared the unbound and mercury-bound nucleosomes of haploid H3-mutant strains expressing either the MAT alpha or the MATa mating-type locus. In a MAT alpha strain, the Hg-bound nucleosomes are enriched in MAT alpha DNA but lack the DNA of the transcriptionally silent HMRa mating-type locus. Conversely, in a MATa strain, the Hg-bound nucleosomes are enriched in MATa DNA sequences but deficient in HML alpha DNA. When the SIR3 gene, known to be required for silencing of the repressed mating-type loci, is mutated in the MAT alpha strain, transcription of the HMRa ensues, and its nucleosomes, as well as those of the MAT alpha locus, are retained by the organomercurial column. It follows that derepression of the silent mating-type locus, caused by the sir3 null mutation, is accompanied by an unfolding of its nucleosomes to reveal the histone H3 SH groups at their centers. Nucleosomes of the pheromone-encoding gene MFA2, a gene that is expressed in MATa cells but not in MAT alpha cells, are bound to the organomercurial column when isolated from MATa cells but not from MAT alpha cells. Thus, there is a good correlation between nucleosome unfolding and the renewed transcriptional activity at mating-type loci, and at MFA2, which had been silenced for prolonged periods. A close temporal correlation between nucleosome refolding and the cessation of transcription is not always observed in yeast, however, in contrast to observations in mammalian cells. For example, nucleosomes of the GAL1 gene are maintained in a poised or primed thiol-reactive state even when the gene is not being transcribed (Chen, T. A., Smith, M. M., Le, S., Sternglanz, R., and Allfrey, V. G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 6489-6498). It follows that the unfolding of the nucleosome cores of the yeast H3 mutant is regulated by factors that are not temporally linked to the recruitment or traverse of the RNA polymerase complex, but which may determine the rate at which different domains of chromatin adapt to the need for transcription of the associated DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1505867161,"Although mouse interleukin-3-dependent, bone marrow culture-derived progenitor mast cells (BMMC) and a Kirsten sarcoma virus (KiSV)-immortalized mouse mast cell line (MC4w) both express on their surfaces receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (Fc gamma R), only MC4w degranulate upon Fc gamma R perturbation. As shown by surface iodination and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of deglycosylated proteins immunoprecipitated with the Fc gamma R-specific monoclonal antibody 2.4G2, a 26-kDa protein, identified as Fc gamma RIII by immunoblotting with antibody to Fc gamma RIII, was predominantly expressed on the surface of MC4w but minimally on BMMC. However, both BMMC and MC4w expressed mRNA for Fc gamma RIII as determined by RNA blot analysis, and both translated Fc gamma RIII as assessed by intrinsic radiolabeling and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of deglycosylated monoclonal antibody 2.4G2 immunoprecipitates. Pulse-chase analysis showed that intrinsically radiolabeled Fc gamma RIII was stable in MC4w cells but was degraded rapidly in BMMC and that newly synthesized Fc gamma RIII remained sensitive to digestion by endoglycosidase H in BMMC but rapidly became resistant in MC4w. These data suggest that the deficiency in surface Fc gamma RIII expression on BMMC is due to the degradation of Fc gamma RIII in the endoplasmic reticulum. Immunoprecipitation of surface Fc gamma R and Fc receptors for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) from digitonin-extracted cells followed by immunoblotting with antibody to Fc epsilon RI gamma-chain showed that gamma-chain is associated with surface Fc epsilon RI and Fc gamma R in MC4w, but only with Fc epsilon RI in BMMC, which lack surface Fc gamma RIII. Inasmuch as BMMC are progenitors of serosal mast cells, which, like MC4w, express surface Fc gamma RIII and undergo Fc gamma R-mediated activation, the data suggest that maturation of BMMC enables Fc gamma RIII to bypass degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in the acquisition of functional Fc gamma RIII/gamma-chain complexes on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1638260110,"5,10-Dideazatetrahydrolic acid (DDATHF) is representative of a new class of antifolates acting through inhibition of de novo purine synthesis. We report here the transport characteristics of the diastereomers of DDATHF, which differ in configuration at C6, and comparison studies with other folate and antifolate analogs. (6R)-DDATHF showed high affinity for the influx system of CCRF-CEM cells with a Km of 1.07 microM and an influx Vmax of 4.04 pmol/min/10(7) cells. Comparative studies with methotrexate yielded an influx Km of 4.98 microM and a Vmax of 6.64 pmol/min/10(7) cells, and with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate an influx Km of 2.18 microM and a Vmax of 6.84 pmol/min/10(7) cells. Uptake of (6R)-DDATHF was competitively inhibited by (6S)-DDATHF, methotrexate (MTX), and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, all with Ki values similar to their influx Km. The (6S)-DDATHF diastereomer had an influx Km of 1.04 microM, similar to that of (6R)-DDATHF; however, the Vmax of 1.72 pmol/min/10(7) cells was 2.3-fold lower than for (6R)-DDATHF. The transport properties of DDATHF were also studied in a mutant cell line (CEM/MTX), resistant to MTX based on impaired drug transport. In this system (6R)-DDATHF showed an influx Km of 1.49 microM and a decreased influx Vmax of 0.60 pmol/min/10(7) cells. A similar effect was shown for MTX (Km of 7.48 microM, Vmax of 1.02 pmol/min/10(7) cells). The number of binding sites in CCRF-CEM cells was similar for (6R)-DDATHF, (6S)-DDATHF, and MTX, 0.74, 0.71, and 0.76 pmol/10(7) cells, respectively. These values were slightly higher in the CEM/MTX cell line (1.07 and 1.09 pmol/10(7) cells for (6R)-DDATHF and MTX, respectively). Treatment of CCRF-CEM cells with either the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of MTX or the corresponding N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of (6R)-DDATHF caused substantial inhibition (> 90%) of the influx of (6R)-[3H]DDATHF and [3H]MTX, respectively. These results suggest strongly that DDATHF and MTX share a common influx mechanism through the reduced folate transport system. The internalization of DDATHF by monkey kidney epithelial MA104 cells, which express a high affinity folate receptor, was also studied. Competitive binding studies using purified folate receptor and radiolabeled 5-methyltetrahydrofolate showed that (6S)- and (6R)-DDATHF both had I50 values lower than 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (12 nM). Further studies indicate that both DDATHF isomers are actively intracellularly concentrated through this route and are also rapidly converted to high chain length polyglutamates. Transport via this system was inhibited in folate-depleted cells by 10 nM folic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1962614587,"It has been well established that the regulation of thymidine kinase (TK) expression is highly growth-dependent. In this report, we present evidence that TK expression in undifferentiated HL-60 cells is not stringently controlled in a growth-dependent manner, except for a very moderate activation of TK in response to growth stimulation. Moreover, we have demonstrated for the first time that TK becomes phosphorylated, and the fluctuation of TK activity in these cells is related to the extent of phosphorylation of seryl residues of the TK polypeptide. This is further reinforced by the observation that the presence of Ser/Thr phosphatases inhibitor in the crude extract increases TK activity. Our data suggest that post-translational modification by phosphorylation is implicated in TK regulation in HL-60 cells."

https://openalex.org/W1554681813,"Fusion of Golgi membranes isolated from rabbit liver with liposomes was studied by lipid mixing of fluorescent lipid analogues and internal content mixing and by electron microscopic observation of transfer of horseradish peroxidase from liposomes into Golgi membranes. A monoclonal antibody was used to confirm fusion of Golgi membranes but not other contaminating vesicles. Fusion was rapid and efficient, reaching about 20% of the maximum after a 5-min incubation using small or large unilamellar dioleoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles. The fusion was dependent on temperature, decreasing at lower temperatures, and becoming nearly zero below 10 degrees C. The addition of ATP, GTP, cytosolic factors, or N-ethylmaleimide did not affect fusion. Treatments of Golgi membranes with 0.1 M Na2CO3 or 1 M KCl did not cause any changes in fusion. However, treatment with proteases inhibited fusion. These results suggest that Golgi integral membrane protein(s) are involved in fusion. Changing the medium to an isoosmotic substance, sucrose, in place of KCl or NaCl inhibited fusion. The binding assay of fluorescent liposomes to Golgi membranes showed that lowering the temperature or replacing salts with sucrose did not affect binding. However, treatment of Golgi membranes with proteases inhibited binding. Addition of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylethanolamine to dioleoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes caused a 2-fold increase in binding and fusion. Fusion between Golgi membranes by themselves did not occur. These results provide some information on the mechanism of intracellular vesicular transport."
https://openalex.org/W1497099025,"We have used site-directed mutagenesis to change several amino acids of the C-terminal portion of the FLP recombinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These residues are absolutely conserved among the six FLP-like proteins from various yeast strains. We have examined the ability of the altered proteins to catalyze recombination in vivo and in vitro and to perform various partial steps of the reaction in vitro. Two of the mutations produced a partial defect in DNA binding but the remainder resulted in normal binding. All of these mutations caused impairment of the ability of the protein to induce the type II bend of the FRT site, and some of these proteins were also defective in DNA strand cleavage. None of the mutations affected the ability of the proteins to perform synapsis between two FRT sites, but some were defective in strand ligation. Interestingly, some mutant proteins showed impairment of the initial stages of the recombination reaction on a linear substrate and yet they maintained the ability to resolve a Holliday intermediate in the reaction. We conclude that this conserved region of the FLP protein is important for the early stage(s) of the recombination reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1580085491,"The stereochemistry and kinetics for hydrogen transfer to the catalytically essential NAD+ of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHase) have been determined for selected adenosine analogues. Reduced SAHase (ENADH), which was made by reconstituting apoSAHase with NADH, stereospecifically transferred the pro-R hydrogen of NADH to 3'-ketoadenosine, a proposed reaction intermediate. Reduction of SAHase by 5'-deoxyadenosine, alpha-L-lyxofuranosyladenine, or adenosine-5'-carboxylate quenched the intrinsic protein fluorescence and increased the absorbance of the enzyme at 330 nm. The kinetics for reduction were consistent with a two-step mechanism [formula: see text] where E.L was an initial complex between ligand (L) and enzyme (E), and E'.L' was a complex between reduced enzyme and oxidized ligand. Initial complex formation between SAHase and alpha-L-lyxofuranosyladenine (k-1/k-1 = 22.6 microM) was too rapid to be followed by stopped-flow spectrofluorometry at 25 degrees C. The first-order rate constants for reduction (k 2) and oxidation (k-2) of the enzyme were 7.7 and 0.22 s-1, respectively. The dissociation constant for initial complex formation between 5‘-deoxyadenosine and SAHase was 24 microM; k2 and k-2 were 8.4 x 10(-3) and 4.2 x 10(-3) s-1, respectively. The association rate constant for binding of adenosine-5‘-carboxylate to SAHase (k 1) was 2.1 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, and the dissociation rate constant (k-1) was 0.15 s-1; k 2 and k-2 were 0.1 and 0.15 s-1, respectively. The association rate constant for adenine was 5.5 x 10(6) M-1 s-1, and the dissociation rate constant was 6.4 s-1."
https://openalex.org/W1546766816,"Abstract In vitro nuclear run-on transcription analysis using probes directed against different regions of CYP1A2 revealed that the 70-100-fold induction of CYP1A2 mRNA by polycyclic aromatic compounds is associated with a corresponding increase in the transcriptional activation of this gene in rat liver. Probes from regions of the 1st, 2nd, and 4th introns detected approximately 50-100-fold higher CYP1A2 run-on transcription in liver nuclei from inducer-treated animals than in nuclei from untreated animals. The run-on signals from untreated rats were 3-5-fold above background signals. Additional experiments using single-stranded DNA probes and a probe from a region 5' to the CYP1A2 transcription start site revealed that the inducer-dependent transcripts were colinear with the CYP1A2 mRNA and that they did not result from read through of an initiation event 5' to CYP1A2. Run-on transcription analyses were also carried out with nuclei from isolated hepatocytes using the same series of probes spanning CYP1A2. These analyses indicated that the inducer-dependent accumulation of CYP1A2 mRNA in hepatocytes is associated with at least a 20-fold increase in CYP1A2 transcription. In contrast to liver and hepatocytes, these probes failed to detect run-on transcripts from kidney nuclei, indicating that the lack of CYP1A2 mRNA in this tissue is due to the lack of transcriptional activation of this gene by polycyclic aromatic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1522244153,"Abstract Introns interrupt many of the tRNA genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at a constant position in the anticodon loop. Pre-tRNA transcripts must be accurately cleaved at 3' and 5' splice sites by tRNA endonuclease to release these introns. In order to study splice site cleavage order, substrates were prepared in which the ribose 2'-OH at each of the splice sites was phosphorylated. This modification blocked cleavage by the endonuclease. We found that whichever splice site was blocked the endonuclease can cleave the other site, indicating that the two splice sites were cleaved independently. The endonuclease also cleaved both 3'- and 5'-nicked pre-tRNA(Phe). In addition, both kinds of 2/3 molecules (exon+intron) were observed in kinetic studies, indicating that they were true biochemical intermediates. The rates of cleavage at the 3' and 5' splice sites of pre-tRNA were compared in several ways. The results showed that the endonuclease cleaves 3' and 5' sites at almost the same rate in the first cleavage, whereas in the second cleavage the 3' site was cleaved faster, indicating that the rates of the two routes for cleavage were unequal. These results demonstrated that the endonuclease cleaved pre-tRNA in a random order, creating two routes for removal of introns from pre-tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1586034546,"The proteins which bind copper when it first enters cells and deliver that copper to the cellular sites where copper is incorporated into copper enzymes are unknown. When radiolabeled (64Cu(II)) cytosol proteins were fractionated on Superose columns, two large copper-binding protein fractions were detected which together bound 63% of the total 64Cu recovered from the column. A self-associating, 50-kDa copper-binding protein was identified whose tetramer and dimer appeared to elute in one of the major copper-binding fractions and the monomer eluted in the other. This protein was purified to homogeneity by successive Mono Q, chelating Superose, and phenyl-Superose columns. The concentrated, purified protein showed high amounts of tetramer and monomer plus some dimer, each of which bound copper. Rechromatography of the tetramer-dimer fraction on Superose gave rise to approximately equal amounts of tetramer, dimer, and monomer. Similarly, rechromatography of the monomer fraction gave rise to dimer and tetramer. Thus, the results with the purified protein confirmed that the 50-kDa protein exists as a tetramer-dimer-monomer equilibrium. The 50-kDa protein apparently makes a major contribution to the total copper-binding activity of the mouse hepatic cytosol and may play a significant role in intracellular copper metabolism."
