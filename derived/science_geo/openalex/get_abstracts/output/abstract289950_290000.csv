https://openalex.org/W2082024900,"When two fluid phases are near a critical point, one of them will be excluded from contact with any third phase that happens to be present by a wetting film of the other critical phase. A simple and quite general strategy that may be used to induce a phase transition from complete wetting of the third phase to incomplete wetting is to add a new component to the fluid phases chosen to drive the two phases away from their critical point. This strategy is illustrated for methanol-cyclohexane mixtures."

Shortwave solar radiation appears to be an important physical factor controlling the biology of shallow tropical benthic marine communities."
https://openalex.org/W2062447230,Extraction of lipids from the shed epidermis of the terrestrial snake Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta increases cutaneous water loss in vitro as much as 15-fold. Partial denaturation of epidermal keratin without lipid extraction increases cutaneous water loss only twofold. Histological observations and thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography of the lipid extracts indicate a complex mixture of polar and neutral lipids predominantly in the mesos layer of the cornified epidermis. Comparative measurements of cutaneous water loss in other species of snakes and a lizard show that permeabilities differ naturally but are essentially identical after lipid extraction. These findings establish the importance of lipids in the permeability barrier of reptilian skin and suggest that keratin or scale morphology are of nominal importance in limiting water exchange.

https://openalex.org/W2082033673,"Analysis of middle Eocene to early, Oligocene calcareous and siliceous microfossils shows gradual biotic changes with no massive extinction event across the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. Biotic changes in the late Paleogene appear to reflect changing paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic conditions and do not support suggestions of a catastrophic biotic event caused by a bolide impact at the Eocenel Oligocene boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2058916711,"The Dufour's gland of Anthophora abrupta, a solitary bee, secretes a complex mixture of liquid triglycerides containing one long-chain and two shortchain fatty acids. This is applied inside the earthen brood cells and added to the provision, where it is converted, perhaps by enzymes from the bee's saliva or gut, to solid diglycerides that are later eaten by the bee larvae. This use of Dufour's gland secretion as food and its nutritive function are reminiscent of the royal jelly secreted by honey bees."

https://openalex.org/W2162968366,"The planar lipid bilayer membrane is assumed to be in osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding Plateau-Gibbs border (annulus) and entrapped microlenses. An electric field applied across the membrane raises the chemical potential of the alkane in the bilayer, causing it to shift from the bilayer to the annulus and microlenses. This shift results in a decrease in thickness."
https://openalex.org/W1980142981,"Plutonium isotopes, derived from global fallout following atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, have been measured in the water and sediments of a natural alkaline, saline lake. The activities of fallout plutonium in the water column are about two orders of magnitude greater than in most freshwater lakes, where these nuclides are found predominantly in the sediments."
https://openalex.org/W1974190605,"Underfed colonies of Neivamyrmex nigrescens in the laboratory emigrated on 62 percent of the nomadic days, as compared with only 28 percent for overfed colonies. Because the emigration frequency in the field is similar to that of underfed colonies, nomadic raids may not bring in enough food to satiate the larval broods. Since emigrations take time away from raiding, the food-related mechanism underlying emigrations may have evolved under more stringent ecological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1979037101,"Despite several decades of international effort, the development problems of sub-Saharan Africa remain acute. By many of the quality of life indexes, the majority of African countries are standing still or moving backward. A rapidly growing population with an adverse dependency ratio places demands on services that present development strategies cannot satisfy. A reorientation of development is necessary to establish realistic population policies and to implement comprehensive family planning programs."
https://openalex.org/W2079609455,"Three pollen spectra from lake sediments stratigraphically well below mid-Kansan fauna indicate plant associations for the Sonoran desert, Arizona, approximating those found now at elevations of 1500 ft and more above the desert floor. The presence of Ostrya, Betula, and Artemisia may indicate some invasion by northern species as well. A climate cooler or wetter, or both cooler and wetter, than the present climate is inferred from paleobotanical and sedimentary evidence. Correlation with the Nebraskan glacial stage is tentatively suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2089472471,"A large geophysical program of exploration that uses deep seismic sounding has been under way in the Soviet Union for decades. Underground nuclear explosives have been used as strong seismic sources since 1971. The wide spacing between these seismic sources-for example, 500 kilometers-has permitted seismic exploration of inaccessible areas in traverses up to 3000 kilometers in length. During the same time an ultra-deep drilling program has also been under way. The data gathered have been used to elucidate details of the crust as well as to describe layering and inhomogeneities in the underlying mantle. By Soviet account, deep seismic sounding has been instrumental in confirming the existence of numerous sedimentary structures containing oil and gas fields in western and eastern Siberia."
