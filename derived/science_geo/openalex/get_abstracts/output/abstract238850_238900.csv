https://openalex.org/W1973353128,"Complex networks have been studied extensively due to their relevance to many real systems as diverse as the World-Wide-Web (WWW), the Internet, energy landscapes, biological and social networks \cite{ab-review,mendes,vespignani,newman,amaral}. A large number of real networks are called ``scale-free'' because they show a power-law distribution of the number of links per node \cite{ab-review,barabasi1999,faloutsos}. However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not {\it length-scale} invariant or self-similar. This conclusion originates from the ``small-world'' property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the ``diameter'' of the network \cite{erdos,bollobas,milgram,watts}, rather than the power-law relation expected for a self-similar structure. Nevertheless, here we present a novel approach to the analysis of such networks, revealing that their structure is indeed self-similar. This result is achieved by the application of a renormalization procedure which coarse-grains the system into boxes containing nodes within a given ""size"". Concurrently, we identify a power-law relation between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box defining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties, which are shown for the WWW, social, cellular and protein-protein interaction networks, help to understand the emergence of the scale-free property in complex networks. They suggest a common self-organization dynamics of diverse networks at different scales into a critical state and in turn bring together previously unrelated fields: the statistical physics of complex networks with renormalization group, fractals and critical phenomena."

https://openalex.org/W2054873911,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a naturally occurring gas with potent vasodilator activity. Cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) utilize L-cysteine as substrate to form H2S. Of these two enzymes, cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) is believed to be the key enzyme that forms H2S in the cardiovascular system. Whilst H2S has been reported to relax precontracted rat arteries in vitro and to lower blood pressure in the rat, its effect in an inflammatory condition such as acute pancreatitis has not previously been reported. In this paper, we report the presence of H2S synthesizing enzyme activity and CSE (as determined by mRNA signal) in the pancreas. Also, prophylactic, as well as therapeutic, treatment with the CSE inhibitor, DL-propargylglycine (PAG), significantly reduced the severity of caerulein-induced pancreatitis and associated lung injury, as determined by 1) hyperamylasemia [plasma amylase (U/L) (control, 1204+/-59); prophylactic treatment: placebo, 10635+/-305; PAG, 7904+/-495; therapeutic treatment: placebo, 10427+/-470; PAG, 7811+/-428; P<0.05 PAG c.f. placebo; n=24 animals in each group]; 2) neutrophil sequestration in the pancreas [pancreatic myeloperoxidase oxidase (MPO) activity (fold increase over control) (prophylactic treatment: placebo, 5.78+/-0.63; PAG, 2.97+/-0.39; therapeutic treatment: placebo, 5.48+/-0.52; PAG, 3.03+/-0.47; P<0.05 PAG c.f. placebo; n=24 animals in each group)]; 3) pancreatic acinar cell injury/necrosis; 4) lung MPO activity (fold increase over control) [prophylactic treatment: placebo, 1.99+/-0.16; PAG, 1.34+/-0.14; therapeutic treatment: placebo, 2.03+/-0.12; PAG, 1.41+/-0.97; P<0.05 PAG c.f. placebo; n=24 animals in each group]; and 5) histological evidence of lung injury. These effects of CSE blockade suggest an important proinflammatory role of H2S in regulating the severity of pancreatitis and associated lung injury and raise the possibility that H2S may exert similar activity in other forms of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1981615091,"Dnmt3L has been identified as a stimulator of the catalytic activity of de novo DNA methyltransferases. It is essential in the development of germ cells in mammals. We show here that Dnmt3L stimulates the catalytic activity of the Dnmt3A and Dnmt3B enzymes by directly binding to their respective catalytic domains via its own C-terminal domain. The catalytic activity of Dnmt3A and -3B was stimulated ∼15-fold, and Dnmt3L directly binds to DNA but not to S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet). Complex formation between Dnmt3A and Dnmt3L accelerates DNA binding by Dnmt3A 20-fold and lowers its Km for DNA. Interaction of Dnmt3L with Dnmt3A increases the binding of the coenzyme AdoMet to Dnmt3A, and it lowers the Km of Dnmt3A for AdoMet. On the basis of our data we propose a model in which the interaction of Dnmt3A with Dnmt3L induces a conformational change of Dnmt3A that opens the active site of the enzyme and promotes binding of DNA and the AdoMet. We demonstrate that the interaction of Dnmt3A and Dnmt3L is transient, and after DNA binding to Dnmt3A, Dnmt3L dissociates from the complex. Following dissociation of Dnmt3L, Dnmt3A adopts a closed conformation leading to slow rates of DNA release. Therefore, Dnmt3L acts as a substrate exchange factor that accelerates DNA and AdoMet binding to de novo DNA methyltransferases.

In vertebrates DNA is methylated at the 5-position of cytosine residues within CG dinucleotides, which are methylated to 70–80% in a tissue- and cell-specific pattern (1.Hermann A. Gowher H.

Methylation is involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and development (4.Li E. Nat. Rev.

The methyl group of the coenzyme S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; MTase, methyltransferase; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; MTase, methyltransferase; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. is transferred to cytosine residues of the DNA by DNA methyltransferases (MTases) three families of which have been identified to date in mammals: Dnmt1, Dnmt2, and Dnmt3 (8.Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All these enzymes contain a domain of ∼400–500 amino acid residues, which is characterized by the presence of 10 conserved amino acid motifs, shared between prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes of DNA-(cytosine-C5)-methyltransferases (8.Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition, the Dnmt1 and the Dnmt3 enzymes harbor large N-terminal regulatory parts (8.Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Chen T. Li E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2004; 60: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Dnmt1 has a strong preference for hemimethylated CG sites implicating a function in maintenance of the methylation pattern of the DNA after replication (11.Gruenbaum Y. Cedar H. Razin A.

Dnmt2 is the smallest enzyme among the eukaryotic methyltransferases comprising only the catalytic domain. It has been shown to be an active methyltransferase, with a very slow turnover (16.Hermann A. Schmitt S. Jeltsch A. J. Biol.

Dnmt3A and -3B have a regulatory N-terminal domain that in contrast to Dnmt1 is not essential for catalysis (22.Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Biol.

The N-terminal parts of Dnmt3A and -3B contain an ATRX-like Cys-rich domain (also called PHD domain) and a PWWP domain, which are involved in interactions of the enzymes with other proteins and in targeting to heterochromatin (24.Bachman K.E.

Dnmt3A and -3B also methylate cytosines in a non-CG context, however the biological function of this activity is not known (29.Aoki A. Suetake I. Miyagawa J. Fujio T. Chijiwa T. Sasaki H. Tajima S.

Both enzymes do not distinguish between unmethylated and hemimethylated substrates and are involved in de novo methylation in vivo (20.Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar, 30.Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 33.Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4413) Google Scholar). Despite these biochemical similarities the Dnmt3A and -3B enzymes have distinct biological roles. Dnmt3B is responsible for methylation of pericentromeric satellite regions (33.Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4413) Google Scholar, 34.Hansen R.S. Wijmenga C. Luo P. Stanek A.M. Canfield T.K. Weemaes C.M. Gartler S.M.

Viegas-Pequignot E. Nature. 1999; 402: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Dnmt3B–/– knock-out mice die during late embryonic stage and the embryos lack methylation in pericentromeric repeat region (33.Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4413) Google Scholar). Loss of Dnmt3B activity in human leads to the ICF syndrome, a genetic disorder that is accompanied by low methylation in pericentromeric satellite region of chromosomes 1, 9, and 16 (36.Ehrlich M. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 109: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Dnmt3A knock-out mice show developmental abnormalities and die few weeks after birth (33.Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4413) Google Scholar). This enzyme has been associated with the methylation of single copy genes and retrotransposons (37.Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Bourc'his D. Bestor T.H. Nature. 2004; 431: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 39.Bourc'his D. Xu G.L. Lin C.S. Bollman B. Bestor T.H. Science. 2001; 294: 2536-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), and it is required for the establishment of the genomic imprint during germ cell development (40.Kaneda M. Okano M. Hata K. Sado T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Sasaki H. Nature. 2004; 429: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar).The third member of the Dnmt3 family, Dnmt3L, shows clear homology to the Dnmt3A and -3B enzymes (21.Aapola U. Kawasaki K. Scott H.S. Ollila J. Vihinen M. Heino M. Shintani A. Minoshima S. Krohn K. Antonarakis S.E. Shimizu N. Kudoh J. Peterson P. Genomics. 2000; 65: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Its N-terminal part contains the PHD domain, but not the PWWP domain, and the C-terminal part extends up to conserved motif VIII (Fig. 1). Strikingly, Dnmt3L carries mutations within all conserved motifs that contain the catalytic residues of DNA-(cytosine-C5)-methyltransferases, suggesting that Dnmt3L adopts the typical MTase fold, but it does not have catalytic activity. In cotransfection experiments Dnmt3L has been shown to stimulate DNA methylation by Dnmt3A in human cell lines (41.Chedin F. Lieber M.R. Hsieh C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16916-16921Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Stimulation of Dnmt3B was not detectable in these experiments. However, biochemical studies revealed an interaction of Dnmt3L with Dnmt3A and -3B (37.Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Dnmt3L has been shown to interact with histone deacetylases via its PHD-like Zn domain and to contribute to gene silencing that is not mediated by DNA methylation (28.Aapola U. Liiv I. Peterson P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3602-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 42.Deplus R. Brenner C. Burgers W.A. Putmans P. Kouzarides T. de Launoit Y. Fuks F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3831-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Dnmt3L is expressed during gametogenesis and embryonic stages (37.Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Bourc'his D. Bestor T.H. Nature. 2004; 431: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 39.Bourc'his D. Xu G.L. Lin C.S. Bollman B. Bestor T.H. Science. 2001; 294: 2536-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) showing a similar expression pattern as the Dnmt3A and -3B enzymes. Dnmt3L knock-out mice display a normal phenotype (37.Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Bourc'his D. Bestor T.H.

Science. 2001; 294: 2536-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Homozygous female mice are fertile, but when crossed with wild-type males their pups die at embryonic day 10.5. Analysis of the DNA methylation pattern showed that the female imprint was not properly established in oocytes of Dnmt3L knockout females (37.Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Bourc'his D. Xu G.L. Lin C.S. Bollman B. Bestor T.H. Science. 2001; 294: 2536-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Dnmt3A and -3L together are required for the establishment of an imprint during gametogenesis. Homozygous male knock-out animals are sterile because of defects in spermatogenesis. Methylation analysis showed major loss of methylation in spermatogonial stem cells leading to a demethylation of the DNA and male infertility (37.Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Bourc'his D. Bestor T.H. Nature. 2004; 431: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar).Although several studies have been carried out that elucidate the role of Dnmt3L in vivo, the mechanism by which Dnmt3L stimulates de novo methylation has not been thoroughly investigated. Recently, Suetake et al. (43.Suetake I. Shinozaki F. Miyagawa J. Takeshima H. Tajima S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27816-27823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Dnmt3L stimulates Dnmt3A and -3B in vitro 1.5- to 3-fold independent of the sequence of the substrate DNA. In this work we extend these findings by demonstrating that Dnmt3L stimulates the catalytic activity of the Dnmt3A and -3B enzymes ∼15-fold in vitro. Furthermore, we investigate the mechanism of activation and find that binding to Dnmt3L induces a conformational change of Dnmt3A that facilitates DNA and AdoMet binding. The interaction of Dnmt3A and Dnmt3L is transient and Dnmt3L dissociates from Dnmt3A-DNA complexes. Therefore, Dnmt3L functions as a substrate exchange factor for Dnmt3A and -3B.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteins—Dnmt1, Dnmt3A, Dnmt3B, and their catalytic domains were expressed and purified as described (14.Fatemi M. Hermann A. Pradhan S. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 23.Reither S. Li F. Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol.

Murine Dnmt3L (421 amino acid residues) was cloned into pET28a+ by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA isolated from mouse testis, and its sequence was confirmed. A truncated version of Dnmt3L (CD-Dnmt3L comprising amino acids 208–421) was prepared by PCR mutagenesis as described previously (44.Jeltsch A. Lanio T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar). Dnmt3L and CD-Dnmt3L were purified as described for Dnmt3A. All proteins were >90% pure as determined from Coomassie-stained SDS-gels.Oligonucleotide Substrates—The following oligodeoxynucleotide substrates were used in this study (written in 5′ → 3′ direction): CG30: Bt-GAA GCT GGG ACT TCCGGG AGG AGA GTG CAA/TTG CAC TCT CCT CCC GGA AGT CCC AGC TTC; CA30: Bt-GAA GCT GGG ACT TCC AGG AGG AGA GTG CAA/TTG CAC TCT CCT CCT GGA AGT CCC AGC TTC; CT30: Bt-GAA GCT GGG ACT TCC TGG AGG AGA GTG CAA/TTG CAC TCT CCT CCA GGA AGT CCC AGC TTC; CG16: Bt-GG ACT TCC GGG AGG AG/CT CCT CCC GGA AGT CC; CG 12: Bt-ACT TCCGGG AGG/CCT CCC GGA AGT; CG45: Bt-ATC GCT GAG AAG CTG GGA CTT CCG GGA GGA GAG TGC AAT AGA TTC/GAA TCT ATT GCA CTC TCC TCC CGG AAG TCC CAG CTT CTC AGC GAT.Purified oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). The quality of the oligonucleotide synthesis was confirmed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, demonstrating all oligonucleotides had the expected length and were pure to >95%. Duplex oligonucleotides were prepared by adding equimolar amounts of complementary strands, heating to 95 °C, and slowly cooling to room temperature. Extinction coefficients were used as provided by the supplier.Biochemical Assays—DNA methylation reactions were carried out in methylation buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA basically as described previously (45.Roth M. Jeltsch A. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). If not indicated differently, DNA and labeled [methyl-3H]AdoMet (3048 GBq/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used at concentrations of 0.5 μm and 0.76 μm, respectively. DNA binding was analyzed by nitrocellulose filter binding assay in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA as described (46.Jeltsch A. Friedrich T. Roth M. J. Mol.

UV-cross-linking experiments to analyze AdoMet binding to MTases were performed by mixing 1.3 μm CD-Dnmt3A with [methyl-3H]Adomet (1.4 μm) in the absence or presence of 12 μm CD-Dnmt3L in methylation buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was incubated on ice for 5 min and then exposed to UV in a UV cross-linker (Hoefer UVC 500) for 5 min at 7 × 104 mJ/cm2. The samples were then mixed with SDS loading dye, heated at 80°C for 5 min, and separated on a denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel. After the run, the gel was treated with Amplify solution (NAMP 100, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol and dried. This was followed by exposure to a hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) at –80 °C for 3–4 days.Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—Biomolecular interaction analysis was performed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments using a Biacore X instrument in buffer HBS-EP (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) as recommended by the supplier. Experiments were performed at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at ambient temperature. DNA binding was analyzed using streptavidin-coated chips (Sensor Chip SA, Biacore), which were loaded with 400–800 resonance units of biotinylated oligonucleotide as recommended by the supplier (typically 1–3 μlof1 μm oligonucleotide solution was applied to the chip). Protein-protein interaction was analyzed after covalent immobilization of one protein on the surface of Sensor Chip CM5 (Biacore) using amine coupling kit (Biacore). SPR data were analyzed by standard procedures (47.Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Hogget J. Jeltsch A. Biochemical Methods. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2002: 327-344Google Scholar). Briefly, a non-linear least-squares minimization of the deviation of the experimental data from theoretical data was performed using the Microsoft Excel solver module. Theoretical data were generated by numerical integration of the differential equations given by the different binding models using time integration intervals of 1 s. Three to five data sets obtained at different concentrations of ligands were fitted simultaneously in global analyses. In these fits, kinetic constants were treated as global variables. The accuracy of the numerical integration was confirmed by simulations of simplified systems that could be analytically solved. Error analysis was performed by extensive simulations in which the value of one individual rate constant was fixed and all others varied.RESULTSActivation of Dnmt3A and -3B by Dnmt3L—It has been shown previously that Dnmt3L stimulates DNA methylation by Dnmt3A and -3B ∼1.5- to 3-fold in vitro (43.Suetake I. Shinozaki F. Miyagawa J. Takeshima H. Tajima S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27816-27823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). As an initial step in investigating the mechanism of this process we purified Dnmt3A, -3B, and -3L and studied the stimulation of DNA methylation by Dnmt3L using synthetic oligonucleotide substrates. As shown in Fig. 2A, in the presence of 4 μm Dnmt3L the initial rate of the enzymatic reaction of Dnmt3A was stimulated about 5-fold. We confirmed the absence of DNA methylation activity of Dnmt3L (data not shown), which is in agreement with the observation that all the essential DNA-(cytosine-C5)-MTase amino acid sequence motifs are disrupted in Dnmt3L. Therefore, the increased rates of DNA methylation by Dnmt3A observed in the presence of Dnmt3L must be due to a stimulation of the activity of Dnmt3A. Similar experiments using purified Dnmt1 did not show any influence of Dnmt3L on its methylation activity (Fig. 2F). To examine if the stimulation of Dnmt3A by Dnmt3L requires the interaction of the N-terminal part of Dnmt3A, we have investigated the stimulation of the isolated catalytic domain of Dnmt3A (CD-Dnmt3A), which is active even in the absence of the N-terminal domain (22.Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20409-20414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23.Reither S. Li F. Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate a similar level of stimulation of CD-Dnmt3A by addition of Dnmt3L as observed for the full-length Dnmt3A protein (Fig. 2B). To test for an involvement of the PHD domain of Dnmt3L in the stimulation process, we deleted the N-terminal part of Dnmt3L and studied stimulation of Dnmt3A by the resulting C-terminal fragment of Dnmt3L. Again a strong increase in methylation activity was observed (Fig. 2D), indicating that the stimulation is caused by an interaction of the catalytic domain of Dnmt3A with the C-terminal domain of Dnmt3L. Titration experiments using the same amounts of Dnmt3L and Cd-Dnmt3L demonstrated a comparable degree of stimulation. Similar experiments were also performed with Dnmt3B and its isolated catalytic domain, which was activated to a similar degree as Dnmt3A (Fig. 2, C and E). In summary, addition of Dnmt3L or CD-Dnmt3L caused a 5- to 10-fold stimulation of the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt3A, Dnmt3B, CD-Dnmt3A, and CD-Dnmt3B but not of Dnmt1.Fig. 2Stimulation of DNA methylation of DNA MTases by Dnmt3L. In A–C stimulation of Dnmt3A (100 nm), the catalytic domain of Dnmt3A (150 nm), and the catalytic domain of Dnmt3B (500 nm) by Dnmt3L (4 μm) is shown. D and E, stimulation of CD-Dnmt3A (150 nm) and Dnmt3B (100 nm) by addition of CD-Dnmt3L (10 μm). F, Dnmt1 (100 nm) enzyme is not stimulated by addition of Dnmt3L (4 μm). Unmethylated CG30 was used as substrate (0.5 μm) for all the experiments, except F, where hemimethylated CG30 was used. In all figures the data points without Dnmt3L are labeled by squares (▪), the data points with Dnmt3L are labeled by diamonds (♦).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Determination of the Maximum Level of Stimulation—We were interested to determine the maximum level of stimulation of Dnmt3A and -3B by Dnmt3L. Because this process involves a functional interaction of Dnmt3A and Dnmt3L, the degree of stimulation should be dependent on the concentration of Dnmt3L and the ratio of Dnmt3L and active methyltransferase (Dnmt3A or -3B). Higher amounts of Dnmt3L will increase the level of stimulation until saturation is reached. Therefore, we performed methylation experiments with CD-Dnmt3A and CD-Dnmt3B in the presence of increasing amounts of Dnmt3L (Fig. 3A). The stimulation effects were analyzed as binary binding experiments to estimate the apparent binding affinity of both proteins and the intrinsic level of stimulation of Dnmt3L on CD-Dnmt3A and CD-Dnmt3B. With CD-Dnmt3A and CD-Dnmt3B apparent binding constants of Dnmt3L were in the lower micromolar range indicating a low affinity interaction: Ka(CD-Dnmt3A) = 8 × 104 m–1 and Ka(CD-Dnmt3B) = 9 × 104 m–1. A binary binding model was chosen for analysis, because it is the simplest model that allowed fitting the activity curves. Given that a more complicated reaction mechanism is likely (see below), these numbers can only be interpreted as phenomenological values that do not reflect the real binding affinities of the two proteins. These titration experiments allow extrapolation to the stimulation level that would be observed at saturating concentrations of Dnmt3L. This stimulation level reflects the absolute difference between the catalytic activities of free Dnmt3A or -3B and the Dnmt3A- or -3B-Dnmt3L complexes. On the basis of our data the molecular activation level of CD-Dnmt3A and -3B by Dnmt3L is estimated 15-fold in the case of CD-Dnmt3A and 13-fold in the case of CD-Dnmt3B. We conclude that saturating amounts of Dnmt3L induce a considerable (∼15-fold) stimulation of the catalytic activity of the catalytic domains of Dnmt3A and -3B.Fig. 3A, titration of the catalytic activity of CD-Dnmt3A (150 nm) and CD-Dnmt3B (500 nm) with Dnmt3L. Rates were determined by linear regression from kinetics similar as shown in Fig. 2. The data points represent averages of three independent experiments, and variations of the individual stimulation levels were below 10%. The stimulation is defined as the ratio of the reaction rate CD-Dnmt3A in the presence Dnmt3L versus CD-Dnmt3A alone. B, stimulation of CD-Dnmt3A (150 nm) by Dnmt3L (4 μm) in the presence of various concentrations of oligonucleotide substrate (CG30) and AdoMet. The lines represent global fits of the data to the Michaelis-Menten model. Data points without Dnmt3L are labeled by diamonds (♦), the data points with Dnmt3L are labeled by squares (▪). C, stimulation of AdoMet binding to CD-Dnmt3A (1.3 μm) by CD-Dnmt3L (12 μm) as observed by UV-cross-linking experiments carried out with 3H-labeled AdoMet (1.4 μm). The figure compares the efficiency of cross-linking in the presence and absence of Dnmt3L. The lanes labeled C and A show the Coomassie stain (C) and autoradiogram (A) of the same gel lanes. The apparent molecular masses of Dnmt3A and 3L are 36 and 28 kDa, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Biochemical Analysis of the Stimulation of CD-Dnmt3A— Next we attempted to understand the mechanistic basis of the activation of the de novo DNA MTases by Dnmt3L. For technical reasons, we performed these experiments with the catalytic domain of Dnmt3A. First, we have determined the rates of DNA methylation at different concentrations of DNA and AdoMet (Fig. 3B). A global fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten model yielded Km(AdoMet) = 2.55 μm, Km(DNA) = 0.76 μm, and kcat = 0.65 min–1 in the absence of Dnmt3L. In the presence of Dnmt3L these values were determined as Km(AdoMet) = 0.96 μm, Km(DNA) = 0.25 μm, and kcat = 0.78 min–1. Simulations revealed Km values were valid within ±20%, and the accuracy of kcat values was ±30%. These results demonstrate that the apparent Km values of CD-Dnmt3A for DNA and AdoMet were improved 3.0- and 2.7-fold, respectively, whereas kcat was only marginally changed (1.2-fold).Because the Michaelis-Menten analysis suggested an influence of Dnmt3L on DNA and AdoMet binding of Dnmt3A, we directly tested the effect of Dnmt3L on AdoMet binding using a UV-cross-linking assay. In this assay, 3H-labeled AdoMet was incubated with Dnmt3A, cross-linked to the protein by UV-irradiation, and the binding was analyzed by autoradiography of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. As shown in Fig. 3C, AdoMet binding by Dnmt3A was improved in the presence o"

NPC1L1 was highly expressed in HepG2 cells and localized in a subcellular vesicular compartment rich in the small GTPase Rab5. mRNA expression profiling revealed significant differences between mouse and man with highest expression found in human liver and significant expression in the small intestine. In contrast, liver expression in mouse was extremely low with mouse small intestine exhibiting the highest NPC1L1 expression. A mouse knock-out model of NPC1L1 was generated and revealed that mice lacking a functional NPC1L1 have multiple lipid transport defects. Surprisingly, lack of NPC1L1 exerts a protective effect against diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Further characterization of cell lines generated from wild-type and knock-out mice revealed that in contrast to wild-type cells, NPC1L1 cells exhibit aberrant plasma membrane uptake and subsequent transport of various lipids, including cholesterol and sphingolipids. Furthermore, lack of NPC1L1 activity causes a deregulation of caveolin transport and localization, suggesting that the observed lipid transport defects may be the indirect result of an inability of NPC1L1 null cells to properly target and/or regulate caveolin expression."

https://openalex.org/W1972726656,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting an estimated 4 million people worldwide. Intracellular proteinaceous inclusions called Lewy bodies are the histological hallmarks of PD and are primarily composed of aggregated α-synuclein (αSyn). Although the detailed mechanisms remain unclear, mounting evidence suggests that the misfolding of αSyn into prefibrillar and fibrillar species is the driving force responsible for cellular toxicity. We show here that the molecular chaperone heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 strongly inhibits αSyn fibril formation via preferential binding to prefibrillar species. Moreover, our studies reveal that Hsp70 alters the characteristics of toxic αSyn aggregates and indicate that cellular toxicity arises from the prefibrillar forms of αSyn. This work therefore elucidates a specific role of Hsp70 in the pathogenesis of PD and supports the general concept that chaperone action is a crucial aspect in protecting against the otherwise damaging consequences of protein misfolding.

A variety of interconverting conformational states is accessible to a protein under biological conditions, with the distribution among these states governed by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors (1Dobson C.M. Karplus M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Just as enzymes facilitate changes in chemical states within living systems, molecular chaperones and other cellular factors regulate transitions between protein conformations (2Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3702) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones are likely to mediate the flux between different protein conformations, for example, by binding unfolded or partially folded regions of proteins enriched with hydrophobic amino acids, an ability common to many chaperones including heat shock protein (Hsp) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; αSyn, α-synuclein; CD, circular dichroism; EM, electron microscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; mAU, milli-arbitrary units; PD, Parkinson's disease; PI, propidium iodide; R1, region with healthy cells; R2, region with leaky cells and cell ghosts; R3, region with intact dead cells; thioT, thioflavin T.1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; αSyn, α-synuclein; CD, circular dichroism; EM, electron microscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; mAU, milli-arbitrary units; PD, Parkinson's disease; PI, propidium iodide; R1, region with healthy cells; R2, region with leaky cells and cell ghosts; R3, region with intact dead cells; thioT, thioflavin T. 70 (3Hartl F.U.

The formation of amyloid fibrils, the species associated with a large family of human disorders including Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes (4Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 5Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar), is likely to occur via monomeric or oligomeric intermediates exhibiting exposed hydrophobic surfaces (6Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin.

Thus, molecular chaperones might naturally be expected to target such intermediate species, and indeed a range of molecular chaperones has been observed to be sequestered within amyloid plaques generated in several forms of neurodegeneration (8Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 9Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y. Gray-Board G.L. Chai Y. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar).In addition to their role in assisting protein folding, molecular chaperones appear to have been strongly selected by evolution to protect cells against the harmful effects of protein aggregates (2Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3702) Google Scholar, 3Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2765) Google Scholar, 10Ellis R.J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Amorphous aggregates are usually relatively harmless to cells, at least in part because they may eventually be degraded by the proteolytic machinery (11Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G Sittler A Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Highly ordered amyloid fibrils can, however, be resistant to degradation (12Nordstedt C. Naslund J. Tjernberg L.O. Karlstrom A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30773-30776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in addition they, or perhaps more generally their precursors, can be exceedingly toxic (13Bucciantini M. Giannoni E.

Consistent with their role in the prevention of protein misfolding, molecular chaperones have been shown specifically to inhibit fibril formation (11Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G Sittler A Wanker E.E.

Evidence also suggests that molecular chaperone networks are degraded in old age, which may explain the late onset of most protein misfolding diseases (17Nardai G. Csermely P. Soti C. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 1257-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Dobson C.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 729-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown, for example, that increasing the expression of small heat shock proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans results in improved longevity and resistance to protein aggregation (19Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). These studies therefore suggest that molecular chaperones are likely to play a critical role in the prevention of protein misfolding disorders.Like enzymes, individual molecular chaperones are often components in coupled systems, working in tandem with co-chaperones and co-factors to select distinct protein conformations (20Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Although a combination of Hsp70, Hsp40, ATP, and other factors is likely to be required for full chaperone activity (20Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), recent studies have shown that chaperone binding alone can have a powerful impact on protein refolding and aggregation. For example, the isolated GroEL substrate binding domain has been shown to facilitate the refolding of several proteins (21Zahn R. Buckle A. Perrett S. Johnson C. Corrales F. Golbik R. Fersht A.

Science. 2004; 304: 1793-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Of particular significance for the present study is the finding that the substrate binding domain of the bacterial Hsp70 homologue DnaK has the same high affinity for peptide substrates as the ADP-bound full-length DnaK (25Burkholder W. Zhao X. Zhu X. Hendrickson W. Gragerov A. Gottesman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10632-10637Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Zhang J. Walker G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and that chaperone binding assists in both aggregation suppression and protein refolding (27Tanaka N. Nakao S. Wadai H. Ikeda S. Chatellier J. Kunugi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15398-15403Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that substrate binding alone reveals the most fundamental steps in chaperone function. Our objective, exemplified in the present work, is to understand the specific role of individual chaperones in distinct steps of the aggregation process in order to define factors such as substrate binding that regulate the conformational interconversion of specific proteins (2Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3702) Google Scholar). As part of this strategy, we have investigated the effect of Hsp70 on αSyn aggregation in vitro and show that fibril formation can be strongly inhibited via chaperone binding to cytotoxic prefibrillar species, even in the absence of co-factors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Proteins—Wild-type human αSyn (vector pT7-7) was expressed and purified as described previously (28Hoyer W. Antony T. Cherny D. Heim G. Jovin T.M. Subramaniam V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Recombinant, His-tagged, human Hsp70 was expressed and purified as described previously (29McLaughlin S.H. Smith H.W. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Protein purity exceeded 95% as determined by SDS-PAGE.Thioflavin T Fluorescence—Solutions contained 70 μm αSyn alone or with 7 μm Hsp70 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 150 mm KCl. For kinetic aggregation studies, 15 μm thioflavin T (thioT) (Sigma) was included prior to aggregation. Following filtration using 0.22-μm sterile filters, aggregation was induced by heating the sample to 37 °C with magnetic stirring, and readings were taken every 30 min in a Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer with excitation at 450 nm, emission at 485 nm, and an averaging time of 10 s. ThioT fluorescence measurements were made for 10-μl reaction aliquots by diluting them 150-fold in 50 mm glycine-OH (pH 8.5) containing 5 μm thioT using the experimental parameters described above. Hsp70 alone did not contribute to the thioT fluorescence under these conditions.Electron Microscopy—Samples were prepared from 10-μl aliquots of the relevant aggregation reaction using negative staining by 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate on Formvar-coated nickel grids. Images were obtained at ×25,000 magnification using a Phillips CEM100 transmission electron microscope.Circular Dichroism—Reaction aliquots of 150 μl were diluted 2-fold with buffer and analyzed on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C. Each scan was run in triplicate and averaged. The appropriate buffer spectrum was subtracted from the spectrum of each sample, and the signal contribution from Hsp70 was subtracted from samples containing both αSyn and Hsp70.Gel Filtration—Prefibrillar αSyn was prepared as described previously (30Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Samples consisted of prefibrillar species (18 μm monomer concentration), Hsp70 (54 μm), or a combination of the two at these final concentrations and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The samples (250 μl) were centrifuged and filtered to remove insoluble material and injected on to a Superdex 200 10/30 GL column equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline at 10 °C. A flow rate of 0.4 ml/min was used, and 0.4-ml fractions were collected. Injections were performed in triplicate from independently prepared samples. The molecular mass standards used were as follows: bovine thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, 150 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa (all from Sigma).NMR Spectroscopy—Isotopically enriched α-synuclein was expressed by substituting M9 minimal medium with 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl and/or 3 g/liter 13C-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Two-dimensional gradient-enhanced 15N-1H HSQC spectra of solutions containing αSyn in the absence or presence of Hsp70 were collected on Bruker DRX800 and Avance 700 MHz spectrometers at 10 °C. The samples were made with 100 μm uniformly 15N-labeled αSyn and either 100 or 300 μm Hsp70 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% D2O. HSQC spectra were collected using 16 scans per increment, with 1024 complex points for the direct dimension and 128 complex points for the indirect dimension. Chemical shift values were omitted from further analysis in cases of severe peak overlap. Resonance assignment was performed using modern triple resonance experiments (31Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). NMR data were processed with NMRPipe (32Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11379) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRView (33Johnson B. Blevins R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar).Cytotoxicity Assays—Samples for cytotoxicity assays were prepared and allowed to aggregate according to the conditions described for fluorescence experiments, except for the omission of thioT. Aliquots were removed at varying intervals and, if desired, centrifuged at 16,000 × g to separate aggregates into insoluble and soluble fractions. The insoluble fraction was washed three times with aggregation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 150 mm KCl) to remove any residual, soluble protein species. Samples were then resuspended in aggregation buffer and lyophilized for storage. The retention of aggregate morphology after lyophilization and resuspension was confirmed by electron microscopy (EM). U937 (human myelomonocytic) cells were obtained from the American Tissue Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and cultured at 37 °C and 5% (v/v) CO2. To minimize the effects of endogenous extracellular chaperones such as clusterin (34Poon S. Treweek T.M. Wilson M.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Carver J.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), Aim V serum-free medium (Invitrogen) was used for cell cultures. Untreated U937 cells cultured in Aim V medium under these conditions maintained 85–90% viability. Aliquots of U937 cells suspended in Aim V medium (100 μl containing 20,000 cells) were seeded into the wells of sterile 96-well microplates (Greiner, Germany). Proteins were added from stock solutions to wells at a 5-fold dilution and incubated with the cells for 48 h. In control experiments, only aggregation buffer or a control protein (e.g. ovalbumin) was added to the same final concentration. Following a 48-h incubation, cells were removed from each well (suspended in 100 μl of Aim V), diluted by the addition of 0.2 ml of phosphate buffered saline, and stained with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) immediately before flow cytometric analysis. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSort (BD Biosciences); cells were excited with a 488-nm argon laser, and red fluorescence was collected using a 650-nm long pass filter. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using CellQuest software (version 3.1; BD Biosciences). The statistical functions of the CellQuest software were used to quantify the proportions of cells falling into each of three arbitrarily defined regions defined on the basis of forward scatter and PI fluorescence. The regions corresponded to healthy cells (with low PI staining; R1), “leaky” cells and cell ghosts (both stained to an intermediate level with PI and with either “normal” forward scatter or reduced forward scatter, respectively; R2), and intact dead cells (highly stained with PI; R3). The percentage of dead/damaged cells was defined as R2 + R3.RESULTSαSyn forms amyloid fibrils in vitro that closely resemble those found in Lewy bodies (35Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 36Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar). The assembly and propagation of such structures was quantified by the binding of thioT, a widely used amyloid-specific dye that fluoresces strongly upon binding to fibrillar species. Under our experimental conditions, αSyn forms fibrils on a time scale of 1–2 days (Fig. 1a). The kinetic curve is characteristic of a nucleationdependent aggregation reaction in which an initial lag phase is followed by the rapid formation of thioT-binding amyloid fibrils, ending in a plateau phase for extended periods of aggregation. The mechanism for such a reaction has been studied in detail (37Serio T. Cashikar A. Kowal A. Sawicki G. Moslehi J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M. Lindquist S. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 38Zerovnik E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3362-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and is believed to be initiated by prefibrillar species capable of driving the assembly of mature fibrils such that the rate-limiting step in fibril formation is the growth of prefibrillar species. Indeed, it has been observed that the removal of such species prior to the initiation of aggregation results in a greatly extended lag phase (35Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). ThioT binding experiments were performed both by including initially the dye molecule in the reaction and continuously monitoring increases in fluorescence (Fig. 1a) and by aliquot analysis with the thioT addition occurring immediately prior to the fluorescence measurement (Fig. 1b); similar fluorescence intensity patterns were observed for both methods in the present work.In preliminary studies we observed that Hsp70 could suppress fibril formation; we therefore systematically varied the Hsp70 concentration and the solution conditions to examine their effects on fibril formation. We discovered in particular that a critical but highly sub-stoichiometric concentration of Hsp70 is required for the strong inhibition of fibril formation. Thus, the addition of a 1:10 molar equivalent of Hsp70 (relative to the starting concentration of monomeric αSyn) virtually abolished the increase in thioT fluorescence that is observed in its absence (Fig. 1, a and b). Below the critical concentration, Hsp70 does not prevent the transition from lag phase to elongation and rapid fibril formation, whereas increasing the amount of Hsp70 above the critical concentration had no further detectable effect on the thioT fluorescence. Although the addition of Hsp70 at intermediate time points during the course of an aggregation reaction resulted in a premature leveling of the fluorescence intensity, additional experiments showed that Hsp70 alone does not alter the thioT fluorescence in a reaction that has already reached its steady-state maximum. This latter result indicates that Hsp70 does not modify the structural properties of mature αSyn fibrils or cause them to dissociate, in contrast to the disaggregation behavior observed for other chaperones such as Hsp104 (24Shorter J. Lindquist S. Science. 2004; 304: 1793-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).EM was used to monitor the morphology of aggregates generated in both the presence and absence of Hsp70. EM of αSyn aggregates in the absence of Hsp70 revealed the presence of long, highly ordered fibrils as well as large web-like networks composed of many fibrils (Fig. 1a, upper inset). In aggregation reactions containing both αSyn and Hsp70, however, such long fibrils or dense fibrillar networks were rarely seen (Fig. 1a, lower inset). Instead, a variety of smaller, apparently amorphous aggregates is observed, corresponding to non-fibrillar αSyn species (see below) as well as Hsp70 aggregates, the latter perhaps due in part to the known tendency of Hsp70 to self-associate (39Gething M-J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein-Folding Catalysts. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 3-70Google Scholar). Such a process is particularly likely to occur for Hsp70 under the relatively harsh temperature and agitation conditions used here to initiate aggregation. Moreover, in a Drosophila model of PD (8Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), overexpression of Hsp70 alleviated αSyn toxicity, but proteinaceous aggregates were still observed. Furthermore, Hsp70 has been shown to co-localize with Lewy bodies in postmortem PD brain tissue (8Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), implying an intimate relationship between Hsp70 and the aggregates formed in diseases of protein misfolding.Amyloid fibril formation is typically associated with a concomitant increase in a β-sheet or “cross-β” structure (40Dobson C.M. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2003; 2: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). αSyn, which is an intrinsically disordered protein in dilute solution (41Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar), undergoes a β-sheet transition during fibril formation (42El-Agnaf O. Irvine G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 30: 559-565Crossref Google Scholar), as observed here by circular dichroism (CD) studies (Fig. 2a, upper section). Prior to incubation, αSyn exhibits a CD signal characteristic of a random coil with a minimum at ∼200 nm, but as aggregation progresses a minimum at ∼220 nm is observed, indicative of the formation of β-sheet structure. In the presence of Hsp70, however, the CD spectrum of αSyn remained largely that of a random coil throughout the course of the aggregation reaction, demonstrating the inhibition of β-sheet formation (Fig. 2a, lower section). These data suggest that Hsp70 inhibits the formation of amyloid fibrils by maintaining the majority of αSyn in a soluble state. This conclusion was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the soluble fraction of αSyn reactions in both the presence and absence of Hsp70 (Fig. 2b). It is clear that in the absence of Hsp70, but not in its presence, bands corresponding to soluble αSyn grow progressively fainter with time, consistent with the formation of insoluble forms of the protein (Fig. 2b) that are removed by centrifugation and filtration before gel loading. We conclude, therefore, that the presence of Hsp70 in the aggregation reaction shifts the distribution of αSyn from insoluble to soluble species and thereby inhibits the formation of mature amyloid fibrils.Fig. 2Hsp70 inhibits the formation of β-sheet structure in αSyn.a, during the course of αSyn aggregation, an increase in β-sheet structure was observed by CD, corresponding to the formation of amyloid fibrils (upper section). Samples containing both Hsp70 and αSyn do not show this β-sheet transition (lower section). In the lower section the CD contribution of Hsp70 has been subtracted to show only the spectrum arising from αSyn. b, SDS-PAGE analysis of the soluble fraction of aggregation samples, as collected by centrifugation and filtration, revealed that Hsp70 prevents fibril formation by maintaining the solubility of αSyn. Lanes 2, 4, and 6 contain only αSyn (14 kDa), whereas lanes 3, 5, and 7 contain both αSyn and Hsp70 (70 kDa). Aggregation times for the samples are indicated above the lanes; lane 1, molecular mass marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the addition of Hsp70 after the completion of aggregation has no effect on thioT fluorescence, it would appear that Hsp70 inhibits fibril formation via interactions with monomeric and/or prefibrillar forms of αSyn. To probe potential interactions between Hsp70 and monomeric αSyn, we used heteronuclear NMR methods capable of detecting binding between the two proteins. A 1H-15N correlation (HSQC) spectrum of αSyn in the absence of Hsp70 yielded ∼120 discrete cross-peaks, each corresponding to one of the 135 (non-proline) amino acids of αSyn (Fig. 3); severe overlap prevented the observation of the small number of remaining peaks. The resolved cross-peaks have been shown to be excellent reporters of environmental variation through the observation that substantial line-broadening and chemical shift changes result from interactions between αSyn and SDS (43Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell R.J. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 44Chandra S. Chen X. Rizo J. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Griesinger C. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To analyze potential interactions on a residue-by-residue basis, the backbone assignments of αSyn were obtained by standard triple resonance methods and supplemented with published data (43Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell R.J. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). The HSQC spectra of αSyn, in both the absence and presence of a 3-fold molar excess of Hsp70 relative to monomeric αSyn (an amount of chaperone 30 times greater than that observed to inhibit fibril formation), are virtually identical (Fig. 3), with no 1H or 15N chemical shift changes greater than ±0.01 and ±0.1 ppm respectively (Fig. 4). Only two peaks, Val-3 and His-50, approach these thresholds, and their chemical shifts were shown to be highly sensitive to slight deviations in sample conditions such as pH. A binding event, particularly at this saturating concentration of Hsp70, would trigger much larger and highly correlated chemical shift changes (43Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell R.J. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 44Chandra S. Chen X. Rizo J. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

In addition to the absence of chemical shift changes, no line broadening was observed for αSyn in the presence of Hsp70, conclusively indicating that no significant interactions between Hsp70 and monomeric αSyn occur under these conditions.Fig. 3Hsp70 does not interact with monomeric αSyn. An overlay of αSyn HSQC spectra in both the presence and absence of a 3-fold molar excess of Hsp70 shows no significant chemical shift changes, signifying the absence of an interaction between the two proteins. The cross-peaks corresponding to αSyn alone are indicated by red contours, whereas the cross-peaks observed for αSyn in the presence of Hsp70 are indicated by single black contours. Chemical shift changes were also not observed for the amide side-chain region (not shown) following the addition of Hsp70. Resonance assignments are indicated where space permits.

Although cofilin undergoes dephosphorylation in response to extracellular stimuli that elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, signaling mechanisms mediating Ca2+-induced cofilin dephosphorylation have remained unknown. We investigated the role of Slingshot (SSH) 1L, a member of a SSH family of protein phosphatases, in mediating Ca2+-induced cofilin dephosphorylation. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, ATP and histamine, induced SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation in cultured cells. A23187- or histamine-induced SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation were blocked by calcineurin inhibitors or a dominant-negative form of calcineurin, indicating that calcineurin mediates Ca2+-induced SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation. Importantly, knockdown of SSH1L expression by RNA interference abolished A23187- or calcineurin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation. Furthermore, calcineurin dephosphorylated SSH1L and increased the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L in cell-free assays. Based on these findings, we suggest that Ca2+-induced cofilin dephosphorylation is mediated by calcineurin-dependent activation of SSH1L.

Actin cytoskeletal reorganization is essential for numerous cell activities, including migration, morphological change, and vesicle transport. The actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin family proteins are key regulators for actin filament dynamics and reorganization, with potential to bind to actin monomers and filaments and stimulate depolymerization and severance of actin filaments (1.Moon A.

These activities of actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin (henceforth referred to as cofilin) are negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Ser-3 and reactivated by dephosphorylation (5.Agnew B.J.

Given the essential role of cofilin in actin filament dynamics, it is important to elucidate signal transduction mechanisms that regulate cofilin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in order to better understand stimulus-induced actin cytoskeletal remodeling and the cell activities related to it. LIM kinases (LIM kinases 1 and 2) and testicular protein kinases (testicular protein kinases 1 and 2), which specifically phosphorylate cofilin at Ser-3, have been identified as mediators of cofilin phosphorylation (7.Yang N.

Cytoskeleton. 2003; 54: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), neither downstream signaling pathways nor the roles of SSHs in stimulus-induced cofilin dephosphorylation have been determined. We recently showed that SSH1L is activated downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase in insulin-stimulated cells, but the signaling pathway linking phosphoinositide 3-kinase and SSH1L has remained unknown (29.Nishita M.

We also showed that the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L is increased by association with actin filaments and suppressed by 14-3-3 proteins (30.Nagata-Ohashi K. Ohta Y. Goto K. Chiba S. Mori R.

However, the mechanisms regulating SSH1L activity through F-actin and 14-3-3 proteins are not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the signaling mechanism of Ca2+ signal-induced cofilin dephosphorylation. Previous studies reported that elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration stimulates cofilin dephosphorylation in a variety of cell types (20.Davidson M.M. Haslam R.J. Biochem.

Ono S. Minamide L.S. Takahashi M. Bamburg J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 172-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 31.Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol.

However, it remained to be determined whether or not calcineurin directly dephosphorylates cofilin or merely mediates cofilin dephosphorylation in cells through activation of a cofilin-specific phosphatase, such as SSH1L. Here we now provide evidence that Ca2+-induced cofilin dephosphorylation is mediated by SSH1L via calcineurin. Materials—A23187, histamine, cyclosporin A, FK506, cypermethrin, calmodulin, and recombinant active calcineurin Aα containing calcineurin B subunit were purchased from Calbiochem, and okadaic acid was purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Mouse monoclonal antibody against Myc epitope (9E10) and rat monoclonal antibody against hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (3F10) were purchased form Roche Diagnostics.

Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). pSUPER vector for small interfering RNA (siRNA) was provided by Dr. R. Agami (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) (33.Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). An SSH1L siRNA plasmid (pSUPER-SSH1L) that targets the human SSH1L mRNA sequence (TCGTCACCCAAGAAAGATA) was constructed as described previously (29.Nishita M. Wang Y. Tomizawa C. Suzuki A. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7193-7198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A mutated SSH1L siRNA plasmid, pSUPER-SSH1L(mt), was constructed by substituting two bases in the target sequence (TCTTCCCCCAAGAAAGATA). Cell Culture and Transfection—293T and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. 293T and HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), respectively. Cells were used for assays after being in culture for 30–44 h. Detection of the Level of P-cofilin—Serum-starved 293T or HeLa cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After incubation on ice for 30 min, lysates were incubated in Laemmli's sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) for 5 min at 95 °C, and aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-P-cofilin and anti-cofilin antibodies. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (15.Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphatase Assay of SSH1L—Cofilin-His6 expressed in Vero cells was purified and used as a substrate for in vitro phosphatase reactions. 293T or HeLa cells were lysed in phosphatase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). SSH1L was immunoprecipitated with anti-SSH1L antibody and incubated with purified cofilin-His6 for 2 h at 30 °C. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies to cofilin, P-cofilin, and SSH1L. To examine the effect of calcineurin on SSH1L activity in cell-free assays, lysates of 293T cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-SSH1L antibody or control IgG. The precipitates were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 7.5 units/μl recombinant active calcineurin Aα containing calcineurin B subunit, 14 μg/ml calmodulin, and 6.3 μg/ml cofilin-His6 in 20 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and then further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in reaction buffer containing 0.25 mg/ml F-actin. Reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies to cofilin, P-cofilin, and SSH1L. Dephosphorylation of SSH1L by Calcineurin in Cell-free Assays— Lysates of 293T cells transfected with plasmids for Myc-SSH1L were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody or control IgG. The precipitates were incubated with recombinant active calcineurin Aα and B and calmodulin, as described above. Phosphatase inhibitor (5 mm pyrophosphate) was preincubated with active calcineurin for 15 min at 4 °C. Reaction mixtures were run on SDS-PAGE, and the amounts of phosphorylated SSH1L and total SSH1L were analyzed by staining the gel with Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain kit (Molecular Probes) and Coomassie Brilliant Blue, respectively. Cell Staining—HeLa cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 5 min. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with 3F10 rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody and rabbit anti-P-cofilin antibodies, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on glass slides. Images were obtained using a Leica DMLB fluorescence microscope. Ca2+Ionophore Stimulates Cofilin Dephosphorylation and SSH1L Activation—It was reported that cofilin undergoes dephosphorylation in response to extracellular stimuli that increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration (20.Davidson M.M. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21.Okada K. Takano-Ohmuro H. Obinata T. Abe H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22.Takuma T. Ichida T. Yokoyama N. Tamura S. Obinata T. J. Biochem.

Commun. 2001; 286: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To explore signaling pathways of Ca2+-induced cofilin dephosphorylation, we first examined the effects of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 on levels of cofilin phosphorylation in cultured cells. Serum-starved 293T or HeLa cells were exposed to 5 μm A23187 for different time periods, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-P-cofilin antibody that specifically recognizes P-cofilin and an anti-cofilin antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of cofilin (10.Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Stimulation of 293T or HeLa cells with A23187 significantly decreased the level of P-cofilin in a time-dependent manner, without affecting the total cofilin level (Fig. 1A). A23187-induced cofilin dephosphorylation was also observed in WI-38 human lung fibroblasts (data not shown). These findings suggest that the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations induces cofilin dephosphorylation in various types of cells. We next analyzed changes in cofilin-phosphatase activity of endogenous SSH1L after stimulating the cells with A23187. Serum-starved 293T or HeLa cells were incubated with or without 5 μm A23187 for 10 min, cell lysates were prepared, and SSH1L was immunoprecipitated with an anti-SSH1L antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro phosphatase assay, using a recombinant phosphorylated cofilin-His6 substrate. Cofilin-phosphatase activity was measured by the decrease in P-cofilin immunoreactivity. In both 293T and HeLa cells, the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L significantly increased after A23187 stimulation (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that Ca2+ signaling induces both SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation. Ca2+-mobilizing Agents Induce Cofilin Dephosphorylation and SSH1L Activation—Extracellular ATP and histamine are known to elevate the intracellular Ca2+ concentration by mobilizing Ca2+ from internal stores in 293T and HeLa cells, respectively (34.Aguiari G. Campanella M. Manzati E. Pinton P. Banzi M. Moretti S. Piva R. Rizzuto R. del Senno L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We asked whether these Ca2+-mobilizing agents would induce cofilin dephosphorylation and SSH1L activation in these cells. The level of P-cofilin significantly decreased after exposure of 293T cells to 50 μm ATP (Fig. 2A, top panel). In vitro phosphatase assay showed that the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L in 293T cells increased after ATP stimulation (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). In a similar manner, stimulation of HeLa cells with 10 mm histamine induced both cofilin dephosphorylation and SSH1L activation (Fig. 2B). Therefore extracellular Ca2+-mobilizing agents do have the potential to induce cofilin dephosphorylation and SSH1L activation. Calcineurin Inhibitors Block Ca2+-induced Cofilin Dephosphorylation and SSH1L Activation—A23187-induced cofilin dephosphorylation was reported to be blocked by calcineurin inhibitors, which suggested that calcineurin is involved in the Ca2+-induced cofilin dephosphorylation (23.Meberg P.J. Ono S. Minamide L.S. Takahashi M. Bamburg J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 172-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether or not calcineurin directly dephosphorylates cofilin. We examined the effects of calcineurin inhibitors on A23187- or histamine-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and SSH1L activation in HeLa cells. When HeLa cells were preincubated with calcineurin inhibitors (10 μm cyclosporin A, 50 nm FK506, or 100 nm cypermethrin) and then treated with 5 μm A23187 for 10 min, A23187-induced cofilin dephosphorylation was almost completely blocked in the presence of any one of these calcineurin inhibitors (Fig. 3A, top panel). Interestingly, A23187-induced SSH1L activation was also suppressed by calcineurin inhibitors (Fig. 3A, bottom panel), which indicates that calcineurin is required for the Ca2+-induced SSH1L activation. Both histamine-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and SSH1L activation in HeLa cells were inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with FK506 (Fig. 3B). These findings suggest that Ca2+-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and SSH1L activation are dependent on calcineurin activity and that calcineurin functions upstream of SSH1L. In addition, pretreatment of cells with 1 μm okadaic acid (an inhibitor of protein phosphatases type 1 and 2A) had no apparent effect on histamine-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and SSH1L activation (Fig. 3C), which suggests that neither protein phosphatase type 1 nor 2A is involved in Ca2+-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and SSH1L activation. Expression of Dominant-negative Calcineurin Suppresses A23187-induced Cofilin Dephosphorylation and SSH1L Activation—To further examine the role of calcineurin in Ca2+-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and SSH1L activation, we overexpressed either HA-tagged wild-type calcineurin A (CnA(WT)) or its dominant-negative form (ΔCnA(H160Q)) in HeLa cells and analyzed changes in the levels of P-cofilin and SSH1L activity before and after A23187 treatment. Expression of CnA(WT) alone had no apparent effect, unless cells had been exposed to agents that increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration (32.Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). A23187-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and SSH1L activation were suppressed in cells expressing ΔCnA(H160Q), but not in cells expressing CnA(WT) (Fig. 4). These data further indicate that calcineurin activity is required for Ca2+-induced SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation. Phosphatase-inactive SSH1L Suppresses A23187-induced Cofilin Dephosphorylation—To examine the role of SSH1L in Ca2+-induced cofilin dephosphorylation, we overexpressed either SSH1L(WT) or SSH1L(CS) in HeLa cells and analyzed changes in P-cofilin levels before and after A23187 stimulation. In cells expressing SSH1L(WT), the level of P-cofilin decreased significantly even before A23187 stimulation and declined further after stimulation (Fig. 5A). In contrast, in cells expressing SSH1L(CS), a phosphatase-inactive Slingshot-1L mutant in which catalytic Cys is replaced by Ser, A23187-induced cofilin dephosphorylation was significantly suppressed (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained when CnA(WT) was co-expressed with either SSH1L(WT) or SSH1L(CS) in HeLa cells. A23187-induced cofilin dephosphorylation in CnA(WT)-expressing cells was stimulated by co-expression of SSH1L(WT) and inhibited by SSH1L(CS) (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 3, 6, and 9). These findings suggest that the phosphatase activity of SSH1L is critical for Ca2+/calcineurin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and that SSH1L(CS) acts as a dominant-negative mutant. Suppression of SSH1L Expression by siRNA Inhibits A23187-induced Cofilin Dephosphorylation—To confirm that SSH1L mediates Ca2+/calcineurin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation, expression of endogenous SSH1L in HeLa cells was suppressed by transfection of a pSUPER siRNA expression plasmid, pSUPER-SSH1L, which directs the synthesis of an siRNA targeting human SSH1L (29.Nishita M. Wang Y. Tomizawa C. Suzuki A. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7193-7198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). An empty pSUPER vector and siRNA plasmid mutated in the SSH1L target sequence, pSUPER-SSH1L(mt), were transfected as control experiments. Immunoblot analysis revealed that transfection with pSUPER-SSH1L significantly reduced the level of endogenous SSH1L expression, whereas control vector or mutated siRNA plasmid did not suppress it (Fig. 6A). HeLa cells were co-transfected with CnA(WT) and siRNA plasmids, and changes in P-cofilin levels in cells were analyzed before and after A23187 stimulation. In cells transfected with control pSUPER vector or pSUPER-SSH1L(mt), A23187 stimulation induced cofilin dephosphorylation (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 9). In contrast, in cells transfected with pSUPER-SSH1L, A23187-induced cofilin dephosphorylation was significantly inhibited (Fig. 6B, lane 6). These observations further suggest that SSH1L plays a critical role in Ca2+/calcineurin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation. Suppression of SSH1L Expression by siRNA Inhibits Calcineurin-induced Cofilin Dephosphorylation—We further examined the effects of SSH1L RNA interference on calcineurin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation by staining cells with an anti-P-cofilin antibody. HeLa cells transfected with plasmids coding for HA-tagged constitutively active calcineurin A and calcineurin B (ΔCnA/B) with or without pSUPER-SSH1L siRNA plasmids were cultured for 44 h and then co-stained with anti-HA and anti-P-cofilin antibodies. As shown in the left panels of Fig. 7, the P-cofilin level significantly decreased in cells expressing ΔCnA/B (indicated by arrowheads), compared with the levels in neighboring non-expressing cells. In contrast, the P-cofilin levels in cells co-transfected with ΔCnA/B and pSUPER-SSH1L were similar to those in surrounding cells (Fig. 7, right panels), which indicates that SSH1L is required for ΔCnA/B-induced cofilin dephosphorylation. These observations strongly suggest that calcineurin induces cofilin dephosphorylation via SSH1L activation. Calcineurin Dephosphorylates and Activates SSH1L in Cell-free Assays—We next examined whether calcineurin has the potential to dephosphorylate and activate SSH1L in cell-free assays. Lysates of 293T cells transfected with plasmids for Myc-SSH1L were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody or control IgG, the precipitates were incubated in the presence or absence of recombinant active calcineurin, and the levels of SSH1L phosphorylation were analyzed (Fig. 8A). The amounts of phosphorylated SSH1L (P-SSH1L) and total SSH1L were measured by Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein staining and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, respectively. Pro-Q Diamond staining revealed that Myc-SSH1L was phosphorylated in 293T cells (Fig. 8A, lane 3) and dephosphorylated in vitro by treatment with active calcineurin (Fig. 8A, lane 5). Calcineurin-catalyzed dephosphorylation was blocked by pretreatment of calcineurin with pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of phosphatases including calcineurin (Fig. 8A, lane 6). These results suggest that SSH1L is a phosphoprotein in cultured cells and that calcineurin has the potential to dephosphorylate SSH1L in cell-free assays. The slight increase in the P-SSH1L level by pyrophosphate may be due to the inhibitory effect on SSH1L autodephosphorylation (Fig. 8A, lane 4). We also examined the effect of active calcineurin on the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L in cell-free assays. SSH1L purified from 293T cells by immunoprecipitation was incubated with or without recombinant active calcineurin and subjected to the in vitro cofilin-phosphatase assay (Fig. 8B). Incubation of SSH1L with calcineurin significantly increased the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L (Fig. 8B, lanes 3 and 4). In control experiments, calcineurin alone had no apparent effect on the P-cofilin level (Fig. 8B, lane 2). These results suggest that calcineurin has the potential to stimulate the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L, but not to catalyze cofilin dephosphorylation itself, in cell-free assays. These data, taken together with the data of Fig. 8A, indicate that calcineurin appears to activate SSH1L by dephosphorylation. Cofilin plays an essential role in regulating actin filament dynamics. Its actin-depolymerizing and -severing activities are inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser-3 by LIM kinases and testicular protein kinases and reactivated by dephosphorylation by SSH family phosphatases (7.Yang N.

Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although a variety of extracellular stimuli induce cofilin dephosphorylation, the signaling pathways that lead to cofilin dephosphorylation have not been well understood. In the present study, we provided evidence that Ca2+ signal-induced cofilin dephosphorylation is mediated by consecutive activation of two protein phosphatases, calcineurin and SSH1L. We showed that Ca2+ ionophore and Ca2+-mobilizing agents induced SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation, both of which were suppressed by inhibition of calcineurin. These data indicate that Ca2+-induced SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation are mediated by calcineurin. Importantly, knockdown of endogenous SSH1L expression by siRNA abolished Ca2+- or calcineurin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation. Furthermore, calcineurin dephosphorylated SSH1L and stimulated cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L in cell-free assays, but it had no apparent activity to catalyze cofilin dephosphorylation directly. Taken together, these findings suggest that SSH1L is essential for Ca2+-induced cofilin dephosphorylation as a downstream effector of calcineurin and that calcineurin stimulates cofilin dephosphorylation apparently only through SSH1L activation. Thus, we propose a novel signaling cascade of Ca2+-calcineurin-SSH1L-cofilin for Ca2+ signal-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and activation. The precise mechanism of calcineurin-mediated SSH1L activation is still unclear. It is important to identify the residue(s) of SSH1L that is phosphorylated in resting cells but becomes dephosphorylated by calcineurin in response to stimulation of the Ca2+-induced signaling pathway. SSH1L activity is inhibited by association with 14-3-3 proteins, in a manner dependent on the phosphorylation of SSH1L serine residues (30.Nagata-Ohashi K. Ohta Y. Goto K. Chiba S. Mori R. Nishita M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and it is possible that calcineurin stimulates SSH1L activity by dephosphorylating the serine residues that are involved in 14-3-3 binding. In the case of Ca2+-induced apoptosis, calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of BAD causes its dissociation from 14-3-3 and translocation to mitochondria to inhibit Bcl-xL (35.Wang H.-G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Additional studies are necessary to determine whether calcineurin induces SSH1L activation through a similar mechanism. Ca2+ is a versatile intracellular signal mediator that can regulate many different cellular processes, including those related to actin cytoskeletal rearrangement. Ca2+-mediated cofilin dephosphorylation has been observed in various cell types and is thought to contribute to various cell responses, such as thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (20.Davidson M.M. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), chemotactic peptide-induced neutrophil migration (28.Zhan Q. Bamburg J.R. Badway J.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 54: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and nicotine-induced noradrenalin secretion by adrenal chromaffin cells (24.Birkenfeld J. Kartmann B. Betz H. Roth D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because cofilin appears to play an essential role in actin filament dynamics and remodeling, Ca2+-induced SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation/activation must represent an important signaling pathway supporting stimulus-induced actin cytoskeletal changes and related cell responses. In neurons, intracellular Ca2+ signals play important roles in regulating growth cone motility and guidance (36.Henley J. Poo M.-m. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 320-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Local Ca2+ signals can cause growth cone steering responses, with higher Ca2+ signals mediating attraction and lower Ca2+ signals mediating repulsion (37.Hong K. Nishiyama M. Henley J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M.-m. Nature. 2000; 403: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Based on findings that both cofilin and SSH1L stimulate growth cone motility and extension (18.Endo M. Ohashi K. Sasaki Y. Goshima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Meberg P.J. Bamburg J.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2459-2469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), local activation of the Ca2+-SSH1L-cofilin signaling pathway appears to stimulate the directional steering of growth cones. In addition, Ca2+ and calcineurin are known to regulate neuronal plasticity and memory formation in the central nervous system (39.Groth R.D. Dunbar R.L. Mermelstein P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1159-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Modulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in dendritic spines by cofilin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation contributes to spine structure, persistence of long-term potentiation, and synaptic plasticity (40.Meng Y. Zhang Y. Tregoubov V. Janus C. Cruz L. Jackson M. Lu W.Y. MacDonald J.F. Falles D.L. Jia Z. Neuron. 2002; 35: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 41.Fukazawa Y. Saitoh Y. Ozawa F. Ohta Y. Mizuno K. Inokuchi K. Neuron. 2003; 38: 447-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+/calcineurin-induced SSH1L activation may be one of the mechanisms by which Ca2+/calcineurin regulates neuronal actin cytoskeletal dynamics and hence modulates synaptic function and neuronal plasticity. Various signaling pathways are involved in stimulus-induced cofilin dephosphorylation. In insulin-stimulated cells, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and its product, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, are involved in SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation (29.Nishita M. Wang Y. Tomizawa C. Suzuki A. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7193-7198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In other types of cells, cAMP and protein kinase C signals stimulate cofilin dephosphorylation (1.Moon A. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 2.Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 21.Okada K.

Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 172-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In contrast to the Ca2+ signal, cAMP- or protein kinase C signal-induced cofilin dephosphorylation is insensitive to calcineurin or calmodulin inhibitors (23.Meberg P.J. Ono S. Minamide L.S. Takahashi M. Bamburg J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 172-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 28.Zhan Q. Bamburg J.R. Badway J.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 54: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which indicates the existence of calcineurin-independent signaling pathways for cofilin dephosphorylation. Additional studies are required to determine whether SSH1L, other members of a SSH family (e.g. SSH2L and SSH3L), or other more general classes of protein phosphatases, such as protein phosphatase type 1 and 2A (27.Ambach A. Saunus J. Konstandin M. Wesselborg S. Meuer S.C. Samstag Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3422-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), are involved in cAMP- and protein kinase C-induced cofilin dephosphorylation. Indeed, cofilin dephosphorylation/activation appears to be one of the important and convergent points in a cell signaling network through which a variety of extracellular stimuli regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics and organization.

Unlike other TGFβ ligands, co-receptors for BMP ligands have not been described. Here we show that DRAGON, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored member of the repulsive guidance molecule family, which is expressed early in the developing nervous system, enhances BMP but not TGFβ signaling. DRAGON binds directly to BMP2 and BMP4 but not to BMP7 or other TGFβ ligands. The enhancing action of DRAGON on BMP signaling is also reduced by administration of Noggin, a soluble BMP antagonist, indicating that the action of DRAGON is ligand-dependent. DRAGON associates directly with BMP type I (ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6) and type II (ActRII and ActRIIB) receptors, and its signaling is reduced by dominant negative Smad1 and ALK3 or -6 receptors. In the Xenopus embryo, DRAGON both reduces the threshold of the ability of Smad1 to induce mesodermal and endodermal markers and alters neuronal and neural crest patterning. The direct interaction of DRAGON with BMP ligands and receptors indicates that it is a BMP co-receptor that potentiates BMP signaling.

Cho K.W. Dev. Biol. 2001; 239: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2.Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These functions require the tight control of ligand production, ensuring a highly ordered spatiotemporal distribution and specific activation, via receptor complexes, of particular intracellular signaling pathways. The TGFβ/activin/nodal ligand subfamily contributes to the specification of endoderm and mesoderm in pregastrula embryos and at gastrula stages, to dorsal mesoderm formation and anterior-posterior patterning (3.Stemple D.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 843-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 4.Kimelman D. Griffin K.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Later, TGFβ ligands influence the body axis and patterning of the nervous system (5.Altmann C.R. Brivanlou A.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 203: 447-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BMPs, a second major ligand subfamily, contribute to the ventralization of germ layers in the early embryo and suppress the default neural cell fate of the ectoderm (6.Munoz-Sanjuan I. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). BMPs also participate later in development in the formation and patterning of the neural crest, heart, blood, kidney, limb, muscle, and skeletal system (7.Waite K.A. Eng C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Signal transduction in the BMP subfamily is initiated by ligand binding to a receptor complex composed of two type I and two type II receptors. Three different BMP type I receptors (activin receptor-like kinase ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6) and three BMP type II receptors (BMP type II receptor (BMPRII), activin type IIA receptor (ActRIIA), activin type IIB receptor (ActRIIB)), each with intracellular serine/threonine kinase domains, have been identified (8.Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Ligand binding induces phosphorylation of the type I receptor by the type II receptor, which leads to phosphorylation of cytoplasmic receptor-activated Smads. The BMP subfamily signals through one set of receptor-activated Smads (Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8) whereas the TGFβ subfamily signals via another (Smad2, Smad3). The receptor-activated Smads form heteromeric complexes with a co-Smad, Smad4, which translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Multiple modulators enhance or reduce TGFβ and BMP signaling. The access of TGFβ ligands to receptors is inhibited by the soluble proteins LAP, decorin, and α2-macroglobulin that bind and sequester the ligands (2.Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble BMP antagonists include Noggin, chordin, chordin-like, the DAN/Cerberus protein family, and sclerostin (2.Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGFβ ligand access to receptors is also controlled by membrane-bound receptors. BAMBI acts as a decoy receptor, competing with the type I receptor (9.Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massague J. Niehrs C. Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), β-glycan (TGFβ type III receptor) enhances TGFβ binding to the type II receptor (10.Brown C.B. Boyer A.S. Runyan R.B.

Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Cripto, an EGF-CFC glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein, acts as a co-receptor, increasing the binding of the TGFβ ligands nodal, Vg1, and growth and differentiation factor 1 to activin receptors (16.Cheng S.K.

Only co-receptors acting within the TGFβ/activin/nodal signal transduction pathway have been identified so far. We now find that DRAGON, a 436-amino-acid GPI-anchored protein identified by us and expressed early in the embryonic nervous system (18.Samad T.A. Srinivasan A. Karchewski L.A. Jeong S.J.

DRAGON is a member of a gene family comprising two other GPI-linked proteins, repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) (19.Monnier P.P. Sierra A. Macchi P. Deitinghoff L. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Flad M.

Here, we show that DRAGON enhances BMP signaling, binds to specific BMP ligands, associates with BMP receptors, and potentiates BMP cellular signaling, indicating that DRAGON is a BMP co-receptor. The rabbit polyclonal DRAGON antibody was characterized and described previously (18.Samad T.A. Srinivasan A. Karchewski L.A. Jeong S.J. Campagna J.A. Ji R.R. Fabrizio D.A. Zhang Y. Lin H.Y. Bell E. Woolf C.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2027-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the peptide sequence TAAAHSALEDVEALHPRKC (molecular weight, 2019.01), which is present in the C terminus of DRAGON up-stream of its hydrophobic tail and affinity-purified using the same peptide. The antibody binds with high affinity to recombinant DRAGON expressed in HEK293T-transfected cells, recognizing a band of 50-55 kDa in Western blots. Western blots of protein extracts from neonatal and adult dorsal root ganglion and dorsal root ganglion primary cultures show a similar band with an additional lower band of 35-40 kDa, indicating possible proteolytic cleavage of endogenous DRAGON, similar to that found for chick RGM (19.Monnier P.P. Sierra A. Macchi P. Deitinghoff L. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Flad M. Hornberger M.R. Stahl B. Bonhoeffer F. Mueller B.K. Nature. 2002; 419: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Preincubation of DRAGON antibody with 1 μm of the above antigenic peptide (4 h at room temperature) results in a loss of both bands by Western blot and staining signals by immunohistochemistry. To obtain E2.5 embryos, 5-week-old female ICR mice were superovulated by injecting 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma) 48 h after a prior administration of 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (Sigma). Treated females were mated with fertile male mice of the same strain and E2.5 embryos were flushed from oviducts. Embryos were washed with PBS containing 3% FBS (3% FBS-PBS) and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. They were permeabilized for 30min with 20 mm HEPES, 300 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH7.4. After blocking with 3% FBS-PBS for 30min, embryos were incubated with the DRAGON antibody diluted 1:2000 in 3% FBS-PBS overnight at 4 °C, washed, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with 3% FBS-PBS for 30min at room temperature, embryos were mounted with mounting medium containing propidium iodide (Vector Laboratories, Inc). Whole mount immunohistochemistry in mouse E10.5 embryos was carried out as described previously (22.Kitsukawa T. Shimizu M. Sanbo M. Hirata T. Taniguchi M. Bekku Y. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly dissected embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, washed in saline for 2 h, and then soaked in 80% methanol series. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% H2O2 in 80% methanol and 20% Me2SO for 3 h. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 3 h, the embryos were incubated with DRAGON antibody (1:500) in TBS-T containing 5% skim milk and 5% Me2SO for 2 days at room temperature. The embryos were then washed 3 times and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution in TBS-T containing 5% skim milk and 5% Me2SO). Horseradish peroxidase activity was detected with diaminobenzidine. The premade Northern blot containing ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane from mouse embryos at the indicated stages (Clontech, Inc.) was used. The membrane was hybridized with a 300-bp DRAGON cDNA probe as described previously (18.Samad T.A. Srinivasan A. Karchewski L.A. Jeong S.J. Campagna J.A. Ji R.R. Fabrizio D.A. Zhang Y. Lin H.Y.

Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos to be sectioned were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in 20% gelatin-PBS.

HepG2, 10 T1/2, or LLC-PK1 cells were transiently transfected with calcium phosphate/DNA precipitation or Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). The next day cells were washed with medium containing 0.2% FBS and treated overnight with BMP2, BMP4, or TGFβ as indicated. Cell lysates were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was monitored by a plate reader luminometer. Relative light units were determined and corrected for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity, as all plates were co-transfected with β-galactosidase expression construct to normalize transfection efficiency. Carrier-free human BMP2, -4, and -7, as well as TGFβ1, -2, and activin were purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). Noggin was also purchased from R&D systems. TGFβ superfamily receptor constructs (28.Rebbapragada A. Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Celeste A.J. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7230-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected into COS-1 cells with Lipofectamine reagent. Cells were affinity-labeled with 1.5 nm [125I]-BMP2 or 500 pm TGFβ for 4 h at 4 °C,andthe receptors were cross-linked to ligands with disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) as described previously (28.Rebbapragada A. Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Celeste A.J. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7230-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-DRAGON polyclonal or anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (12CA5, Roche Diagnostics) and were separated by SDS-PAGE, and 125I-bound ligand was visualized by phosphorimaging. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, cells lysates were incubated with anti-DRAGON, anti-HA, or anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibodies (1:1000) for 4 h, and immune complexes were collected on protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were transferred to nitrocellulose, and proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. DRAGON-Fc (18.Samad T.A. Srinivasan A. Karchewski L.A. Jeong S.J.

This allowed us to express a soluble DRAGON-Fc fusion protein. DRAGON-Fc collected in the medium of stably transfected HEK293T cells was purified using HiTrap protein A affinity columns (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.0. The elution fraction was neutralized with 0.3 m Tris-HCl, pH 9. Purified DRAGON-Fc was run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with anti-Dragon antibody and anti-Fc antibody. For ligand binding assays, 2 μg of BMP2 ligand/reaction was iodinated with 125I by the modified chloramine-T method as described previously (29.Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10995-11000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified soluble DRAGON-Fc (18.Samad T.A. Srinivasan A. Karchewski L.A. Jeong S.J. Campagna J.A. Ji R.R. Fabrizio D.A.

For competition binding assays, fixed amounts of radioligands (50,000-100,000 counts) were added to the samples together with increasing amounts (2 pm-500 nm) of non-radioactive TGFβ superfamily ligands or as indicated. Samples were then placed on protein A-coated 96-well plates (Pierce) for 90 min, washed 3 times with wash buffer (BioFX), and radioactivity was counted using a standard gamma counter. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed on isolated Xenopus animal cap explants or embryos, with orthidine decarboxylase as loading control (30.Munoz-Sanjuan I. Bell E. Altmann C.R. Vonica A.

DRAGON is expressed in mouse E2.5 pre-implantation embryos (Fig. 1A), and in postimplantation embryos (>E7) (Fig. 1B). In E10.5 embryos, DRAGON is found along the neural tube, in the dorsal root ganglia, and in the tips of the neural folds and the tail bud (Fig. 1C) as assessed by whole mount immunohistochemistry. Xenopus orthologs of both DRAGON and RGM are expressed maternally and throughout development and are detected at high levels by tadpole stages (Fig. 1D). Analysis by whole mount in situ hybridization of RGM expression at stage 12 reveals high levels in the ectoderm by the blastopore (Fig. 1E, i). More restricted expression is seen by stage 17 and stage 20 in the neural plate, specifically in the dorsal aspect of the neural tube (Fig, 1E, ii and iii). By stage 35, the expression of RGM is detected in the hindbrain, midbrain, and forebrain regions, as well as the branchial arches. In addition, expression is seen posteriorly in the somites and tail bud (Fig. 1E, iv). The expression pattern of DRAGON and RGM at different embryonic stages in both the developing mouse and Xenopus is comparable with the expression of the BMP type I receptors, ALK3 and ALK6 and BMP type II receptor (31.Dewulf N. Verschueren K. Lonnoy O. Moren A. Grimsby S. Vande S.K. Miyazono K. Huylebroeck D. ten Dijke P. Endocrinol. 1995; 136: 2652-2663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Ebendal T. Bengtsson H. Soderstrom S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This observation prompted us to investigate whether DRAGON contributes to or modulates TGFβ superfamily signal transduction. TGFβ superfamily ligands are classified as TGFβ or BMP-like based on the particular Smad-dependent intracellular pathways they activate. We examined whether DRAGON activates these pathways using specific BMP- and TGFβ-responsive luciferase reporters in LLC-PK1 (kidney epithelial cells), as these cells are highly responsive to many TGFβ family members and thereby allow a parallel analysis of any action of DRAGON on TGFβ superfamily signaling. To determine whether DRAGON alters BMP signaling we used the BMP-inducible promoter BRE-Luc, an Id1 promoter-derived reporter construct (24.Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4883-4891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). BMP2 stimulates BRE-Luc activity in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 2). Co-expression of DRAGON with BRE-Luc in the absence of exogenous ligand increases BRE-Luc activity to levels comparable with that achieved by BMP2 stimulation in the absence of DRAGON (Fig. 2A). To assess whether DRAGON regulates the signaling produced by BMP ligands, LLC-PK1 cells were co-transfected with the BRE-Luc reporter and DRAGON (2 and 20 ng) and incubated with BMP2. BMP2 (50 ng/ml) induces a 6-fold increase in luciferase activity in the absence of DRAGON and a 14-fold increase in DRAGON co-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). DRAGON expression had no effect on TGFβ signaling, assessed by using a TGFβ-responsive promoter (TGFβ-responsive CAGA reporter (12.del Re E. Babitt J.L. Pirani A. Schneyer A.L. Lin H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22765-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) in LLC-PK1 cells (data not shown). DRAGON expression activates BMP signaling in the absence of any added ligand (Fig. 2A). To determine whether this represents a ligand-independent action or is mediated by endogenous BMP ligands either produced by the cell lines or present in the medium, we investigated whether DRAGON activation of BMP signaling is blocked by administration of the soluble BMP antagonist Noggin (2.Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When added to the medium Noggin (50-1000 ng/ml) inhibits both the DRAGON- and BMP2-induced activation of the BRE-Luc reporter in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 2B). Noggin has no effect on TGFβ-induced stimulation of the TGFβ-responsive CAGA reporter (Fig. 2B). DRAGON-mediated activation of BMP signaling is, therefore, ligand-dependent. DRAGON significantly enhances BMP signaling and increases cellular sensitivity to BMP2 in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). To rule out a potential cell-type or reporter-specific effect of DRAGON expression, we examined the generality of this effect, i.e. whether it is restricted to one cell line or to one BMP-inducible reporter construct. We tested the effect of DRAGON expression in 10 T1/2 cells (mouse mesenchymal stem cells), another BMP-responsive cell line (28.Rebbapragada A. Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Celeste A.J. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7230-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), using another BMP-inducible promoter reporter construct, I-BRE-Luc, which contains a portion of intron 1 of the Smad7 gene (25.Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6646-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). DRAGON significantly enhances BMP2-dependent reporter activity in this cell line at BMP2 concentrations of 25-300 pm (Fig. 2C). This effect is lost at 300 pm or higher, where maximal signaling is achieved. Similar results were obtained using LLC-PK1, 10 T1/2, and HepG2 cell lines and different BMP-responsive promoters (I-BRE-Luc, BRE-Luc, and Msx2-Luc) (Fig. 2, and data not shown). DRAGON significantly increases cellular sensitivity, therefore, to low doses of BMP2 in a manner that is neither reporternor cell-specific. These results suggest that the regulatory role of DRAGON in BMP signaling is a generalized phenomenon. This finding prompted us to study the mechanism of the enhancement of BMP signaling by DRAGON and where and how it interacts with BMP signaling components. DRAGON could potentially enhance BMP signaling through a direct modulation of the BMP signaling complex or through an independent receptor pathway that converges on the intracellular Smads. We therefore investigated whether DRAGON binds to BMP ligands, interacts directly with BMP receptors, and whether a dominant negative BMP receptor or Smad mutants reduce the DRAGON-induced enhancement of BMP signaling. DRAGON Binds to BMP but Not TGFβ Ligands—To determine whether cell surface-localized DRAGON binds directly to BMP ligands, COS-1 cells expressing DRAGON were incubated with [125I]-BMP2 or [125I]-TGFβ and receptor-bound ligand cross-linked. HA-tagged BMP type I receptor (ALK6) or TGFβ type II receptor (TβRII) served as positive controls for BMP2 or TGFβ binding, respectively. Immunoprecipitation of DRAGON from [125I]-BMP2-but not [125I]-TGFβ-labeled cells revealed the presence of two [125I]-BMP2-bound proteins of ∼55-65 kDa (Fig. 3A), consistent with the expected size of a BMP-bound DRAGON. The presence of two bands suggests that cell surface-localized DRAGON may be subject to post-translational modification. These data, indicating that cell surface-expressed DRAGON can bind BMP2 but not TGFβ, prompted us to assess whether DRAGON can directly bind BMP ligands. We examined whether DRAGON directly binds to BMP ligands using a soluble DRAGON-Fc fusion protein in a cell-free binding system (12.del Re E. Babitt J.L. Pirani A. Schneyer A.L. Lin H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22765-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). DRAGON-Fc binds [125I]-BMP2 with high affinity and an apparent dissociation rate constant (Kd) of 1.5 nm (Fig. 3B). This binding is competed with an excess of unlabeled BMP2 as well as by BMP4 (4 nm) (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, BMP7 (4 nm), activin A, TGFβ1, -2, or -3 (4 nm each) do not competitively inhibit the binding of DRAGON-Fc to BMP2 (Fig. 3C). Pretreatment of cells with DRAGON-Fc decreases BMP2-but not BMP7-mediated activation of the BRE-Luc promoter in a dose-dependent manner (60 and 300 ng/ml) (Fig. 3D) but had no effect on TGF-β1-dependent activation of the CAGA-Luc promoter (Fig. 3E). DRAGON directly interacts with members of the BMP but not the TGFβ ligand family, with a preference for BMP2 and BMP4. DRAGON Enhances BMP Signaling Only when Expressed on the Cell Surface—To assess whether the GPI anchor is required for the action of DRAGON on BMP signaling, we used the DRAGON-Fc fusion protein where the C-terminal GPI anchor is deleted and replaced by human Fc (18.Samad T.A. Srinivasan A. Karchewski L.A. Jeong S.J. Campagna J.A. Ji R.R. Fabrizio D.A. Zhang Y. Lin H.Y. Bell E. Woolf C.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2027-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). When cotransfected with the BRE-Luc reporter construct this DRAGON-Fc, which is secreted into the medium, fails to increase BMP signaling (Fig. 4A). Western blot confirms the expression of both DRAGON and DRAGON-Fc in the transfected cells (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that the expression of DRAGON on the cell surface is required for its action on BMP signaling. DRAGON Binds to BMP Type I and Type II Receptors—BMP type I and type II receptors are essential for mediating BMP responses. To test whether DRAGON directly interacts with BMP type I and type II receptors, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected either with DRAGON alone or with HA epitope-tagged type I and type II BMP receptors. Anti-Dragon immunoprecipitation followed by anti-HA immunoblotting reveals that DRAGON associates directly with all BMP type I receptors, (ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6) (Fig. 5A) and with the BMP type II receptors ActRII and ActRIIB (Fig. 5B). DRAGON Signaling Is Blocked by Dominant Negative ALK3, -6, and Smad1—We used dominant negative type I receptors (ALK1-DN, ALK3-DN, and ALK6-DN), which are deficient in kinase activity and unable to phosphorylate Smads (33.Clarke T.R. Hoshiya Y. Yi S.E. Liu X. Lyons K.M. Donahoe P.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 946-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), to confirm that DRAGON acts through modulation of BMP receptors and subsequent activation of the downstream Smad1 pathway (Fig. 5, C and D). Co-expression of DRAGON with ALK3-DN and ALK6-DN in LLC-PK1 cells decreases DRAG-ON-mediated induction of I-BRE luciferase activity to base line, whereas co-expression of ALK1-DN does not affect DRAG-ON-mediated BMP signaling (Fig. 5C). Co-expression of DRAGON in LLC-PK1 cells with a Smad1 dominant negative mutant that lacks the C-terminal phosphoacceptor domain (15.Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700A"
https://openalex.org/W2143763602,"Recently, we have demonstrated that anti-ulcer drugs, such as H2-receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors, promote the development of immediate type food allergy toward digestion-labile proteins in mice. The aim of this study was to examine the allergological relevance of these findings in humans. In an observational cohort study, we screened 152 adult patients from a gastroenterological outpatient clinic with negative case histories for atopy or allergy, who were medicated with H2-receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors for 3 months. IgE reactivities to food allergens before and after 3 months of anti-acid treatment were compared serologically. Ten percent of the patients showed a boost of preexisting IgE antibodies and 15% de novo IgE formation toward numerous digestion-labile dietary compounds, like milk, potato, celery, carrots, apple, orange, wheat, and rye flour. Thus, the relative risk to develop food-specific IgE after anti-acid therapy was 10.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.44-76.48). The long-term effect was evaluated 5 months after therapy. Food-specific IgE could still be measured in 6% of the patients, as well as significantly elevated serum concentrations of ST2, a Th2-specific marker. An unspecific boost during the pollen season could be excluded, as 50 untreated control patients revealed no changes in their IgE pattern. In line with our previous animal experiments, our data strongly suggest that anti-ulcer treatment primes the development of IgE toward dietary compounds in long-term acid-suppressed patients."

DPP10 is highly homologous to subfamily member DPPX, which we previously reported as a modulator of Kv4-mediated A-type potassium channels (Nadal, M.

We studied the ability of DPP10 protein to modulate the properties of Kv4.2 channels in heterologous expression systems. We found DPP10 activity to be nearly identical to DPPX activity and significantly different from DPPIV activity.

It is a membrane-bound enzyme belonging to the S9B prolyl oligopeptidase class of serine proteases. Its exopeptidase activity has great physiological importance in the metabolism of peptide hormones and is currently being investigated as a target for the treatment of type II diabetes. DPPIV has important functions also in cell adhesion, cellular trafficking, and regulation of T cell activation, which are mediated by functional domains distinct from the catalytic domain (2Lambeir A.M.

DPPIV is the most studied member of a growing class of interesting molecules with diverse activities.DPP10 is prominently expressed in the brain as well as adrenal glands and trachea, but its functions remain to be discovered. The human DPP10 gene was recently identified as a candidate for susceptibility to asthma, a common disease of the airways involving atopic inflammation and hyper-responsiveness to various agents (6Allen M. Heinzmann A. Noguchi E. Abecasis G. Broxholme J. Ponting C.P. Bhattacharyya S. Tinsley J. Zhang Y. Holt R. Jones E.Y. Lench N. Carey A. Jones H. Dickens N.J. Dimon C. Nicholls R. Baker C. Xue L.

Consistent with this report, independent mouse genome screens have linked airway hyper-responsiveness in mice to a region homologous to the location of DPP10 in humans (7Ewart S.L. Kuperman D.

Insight into how DPP10 relates to human physiology and disease is hindered by the lack of understanding of its cellular functions. In this study, we attempt to ascribe a function to this potentially important protein.Within the DPPIV-like class of proteins, DPP10 is most closely related to DPPX (also known as DPP6). In DPPX, an aspartic residue replaces the serine of the catalytic triad, rendering the protein inactive against substrates cleaved by DPPIV and other S9B prolyl oligopeptidases. The catalytic serine residue is also mutated in DPP10; accordingly, DPP10 was found to lack DPP activity (1Qi S.Y. Riviere P.J. Trojnar J. Junien J.L. Akinsanya K.O. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that DPPX and DPP10 may not act as enzymes in vivo, whereas peptidase activity is a defining property of the DPPIV-like class of proteins.We recently found that DPPX is associated with the poreforming subunits of Kv4-mediated A-type K+ channels and modulates the cellular trafficking, membrane targeting, and functional properties of these channels (9Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Amarillo Y. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ma Y. Mo W. Goldberg E.M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Neubert T.A. Rudy B. Neuron. 2003; 37: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Given the sequence similarities between DPP10 and DPPX and in an attempt to understand the functions of DPP10, we investigated its ability to modulate Kv4-mediated A-type K+ channels. We found striking similarities to DPPX in the ability of DPP10 to traffic Kv4.2 proteins to the membrane and to modulate the functional properties of Kv4.2 channels. In contrast, DPPIV had more modest effects on Kv4.2 channels. We constructed chimeras lacking the extracellular portion of the protein, including the entire catalytic domain. These DPPX and DPP10 chimeras displayed significant Kv4 modulatory activity, strongly suggesting that this function is not mediated by enzymatic activity.Moreover, in situ hybridization showed that DPP10 is expressed in neuronal populations also known to express Kv4 products (10Serodio P. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 11Rhodes K.J. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Doliveira L.C. Monaghan M.M. Burke S.L. Strassle B.W. Buchwalder L.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7903-7915Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and DPP10 protein was found to coprecipitate with Kv4.2 channel complexes from brain membranes, further suggesting that the in vitro effects likely occur in native cells of the central nervous system. Together, these results distinguish DPPX and DPP10 as a functional DPP subfamily able to effectively traffic and modulate Kv4 channels, a unique property within the larger DPPIV-like class of proteins. This function of DPP10 on potassium currents of excitable membranes is the first demonstrated activity of DPP10 and could be important in determining asthma susceptibility.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Cells Expressing Kv4.2 and DPP Proteins—CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were plated at 70% confluence. CHO cells were cotransfected with green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-c3, Clontech) and Kv4.2 cDNA utilizing the FuGENE 6 method (Roche Diagnostics) as described by the manufacturer. In other experiments, DPPX, DPP10, or DPPIV cDNA was cotransfected along with green fluorescent protein and Kv4.2. Note that, in this study, DPPX refers to the isoform previously identified as DPPX-s (9Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Amarillo Y. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ma Y. Mo W. Goldberg E.M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y.

In some experiments, we utilized a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Kv4.2 construct instead of Kv4.2 cDNA. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4) and fixed for 20 min at 37 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and washed again with PBS. The sample was blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal goat serum, and 0.2% gelatin in PBS (blocking solution) at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (0.1 ng/μl; Roche Diagnostics) in blocking solution at 4 °C overnight to detect HA-tagged Kv4.2 or with rabbit anti-Kv4.2 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; Sigma) to detect Kv4.2. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in PBS for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS and then coverslipped. To visualize the fluorescence, we used a Zeiss LSM510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope with a 30-milliwatt argon laser.Electrophysiological Analysis—Whole cell currents were obtained at room temperature with the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique in tissue culture dishes on the stage of an inverted microscope using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Patch pipettes with 2–5-megaohm resistance were filled with solution containing 144 mm potassium gluconate, 0.2 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 4 mm MgATP, and 0.5 mm NaGTP (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH). The extracellular solution contained 135 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH). Seal resistance was typically >2 gigaohms. Currents were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz using an eight-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices Inc.) and digitized at 2.5 kHz. Clampex Version 8 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.) was used to generate voltage clamp protocols and for data acquisition and analysis. Junction potential was determined as 12.5 mV using a salt-agar bridge. This was consistent with a theoretical calculation of 12 mV using Clampex Junction Potential Calculator software. Accordingly, voltages were corrected by 12 mV after experimentation.Protein Modeling—The Jigsaw 3D server (available at www.bmm.icnet.uk/servers/3djigsaw/) was used to predict the structures of human DPPX and DPP10. The predicted structures were aligned and color-coded for sequence diversity using the Swiss Protein Database software package.Generation of Myc-tagged Truncations of DPPs—Tagged DPPs were generated by fusing PCR-generated fragments (see Fig. 5A) of DPPIV (GenBank™/EBI accession number M74777), DPPX (accession number M76427, and DPP10 (accession number AY172661) cDNAs in the mammalian expression vector pCS2+MT (6-myc tags) (12Roth M.B. Zahler A.M. Stolk J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar).Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cells were transfected with Kv4.2 cDNA and DPP or chimeric cDNA. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 and incubated with 1 mg/ml N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) diluted in the same buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Afterward, cells were rinsed twice with 0.1 m glycine in PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 20 min in the same buffer to quench free biotin. Finally, cells were lysed in TTNE buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 10% glycerol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C, and samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g to obtain the solubilized fraction. The biotinylated proteins were recovered from the solubilized cell lysates by incubation with 50 μl of packed immobilized streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma). Bound proteins were eluted from the beads in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously (13Ozaita A. Martone M.E. Ellisman M.H. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 394-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The blot was incubated with anti-Kv4.2 or anti-HA primary antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega), and developed with enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce).Immunopurification of Kv4.2 Channel Complexes—Nondenaturing detergent extracts of brain membranes from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared as described previously (9Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Amarillo Y. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ma Y. Mo W. Goldberg E.M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Neubert T.A. Rudy B.

Briefly, after preclearing the membrane extracts with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads cross-linked to anti-Kv4.2 antibody with dimethyl pimelimidate·2HCl (Pierce). The complexed beads were washed four times by centrifugation/resuspension with TTNE buffer, and the bound Kv4.2 complexes were eluted from the beads by adding sample buffer containing 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol (which dissociates cross-linked complexes), 1 mm EDTA, 1.5% SDS, and 10% glycerol in 50 mm Tris (pH 6.7). Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% Criterion gel, Bio-Rad). The gels were either silver-stained or used for immunoblotting.Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblots prepared as described previously (9Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Amarillo Y. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ma Y. Mo W.

Bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL detection kit (Pierce).Mass Spectrometry and Protein Identification—Silver-stained protein bands were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels under a tissue culture hood to minimize contamination, destained, and digested with trypsin as described previously (9Nadal M.S.

Rat DPP10 cDNA (GenBank™/EBI accession number AY557199) was a kind gift from Dr. Koichi Takimoto. PCR primers CTGACCCTCTGTGATGCCACCAC and TGAGGCATAGAGTTTGAAGTCCGTTATCG were utilized to amplify a 1029-bp fragment of DPPX; primers GGAAATACGAAATGACATCTGACACCTGG and GAGGCATACAACTTCATGTCTGAGATGGG were used to amplify a 982-bp fragment of DPP10 cDNA (DPP10-A). A second 805-bp DPP10 probe (DPP10-B) was amplified using primers GGTAGTATGCTCCCTCATCACAATGTCTG and GGGTGGCATCAGCTCCAAAGTATG. PCR amplification products were cloned into the TOPO TA cloning vector for sequencing (Invitrogen), and the vector was linearized with the appropriate restriction enzyme. Antisense digoxigenin (Roche)-labeled RNA probes were made by in vitro transcription with T3 RNA polymerase. The quality of the probes was verified as described previously (15Saganich M.J. Machado E.

Machado E. Rudy B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4609-4624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 40-μm sections were taken from 10-week-old C57/BL6 mice. Floating sections were prehybridized at 60 °C for 2 h and then hybridized at the same temperature for 15 h. Post-hybridization washes were conducted at 65 °C. Detection of digoxigenin labeling proceeded for 7–13 h. Images were acquired with an Olympus Provis microscope equipped with a Magna-Fire digital camera.Statistics—The two-population (independent) t test (Origin Version 6.1) was used for statistical comparisons. Traces of inactivating currents were fit to second-order exponentials using the standard exponential algorithm of Clampfit Version 8.2, constraining parameters to positive values. For correlation analysis, linear regressions with confidence intervals were determined using Origin Version 6.1 software.RESULTSDPP10 Increases the Surface Expression of Kv4.2 Proteins— When Kv4.2 proteins are expressed alone in mammalian cells, they produce minimal expression of functional potassium channels presumably due to retention of the channel proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (9Nadal M.S.

Coexpression of Kv4.2 with DPPX has been reported to rescue endoplasmic reticulum retention and to generate a large increase in potassium conductance in heterologous cells (9Nadal M.S. Ozaita A.

We investigated whether DPP10 is also able to facilitate the trafficking of Kv4 proteins to the plasma membrane. CHO cells were transfected with Kv4.2 cDNA alone or with DPPX, DPP10, or DPPIV cDNA and analyzed for Kv4.2 expression 48 h later. Fig. 1A shows that, in CHO cells transfected with Kv4.2 cDNA alone, there was minimal surface expression of Kv4.2 protein, with most detected protein residing in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi complex. A similar distribution of Kv4.2 protein was observed when Kv4.2 was coexpressed with DPPIV (Fig. 1B), suggesting that DPPIV does not efficiently traffic Kv4.2 proteins to the membrane. As reported previously (9Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Amarillo Y. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ma Y. Mo W. Goldberg E.M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Neubert T.A. Rudy B. Neuron. 2003; 37: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and replicated in Fig. 1C, DPPX promoted a robust trafficking of Kv4.2 protein to the plasma membrane. Like DPPX, DPP10 facilitated surface expression of Kv4.2 protein (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that, like DPPX, DPP10 may be used endogenously to regulate the amount of Kv4.2 protein expressed at the cell surface, thereby regulating the excitability of the cell membrane.Fig. 1DPPX and DPP10, but not DPPIV, promote the trafficking of Kv4.2 to the cell membrane. CHO cells were transiently transfected with Kv4.2 cDNA alone (A) or with DPPIV (B), DPPX (C), or DPP10 (D) cDNA. Cells were treated with anti-Kv4.2 antibody 48 h after transfection and labeled with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. Images were taken with a confocal microscope. When expressed alone or when coexpressed with DPPIV, Kv4.2 protein was retained in the perinuclear region. When coexpressed with DPPX or DPP10, Kv4.2 protein was located predominantly at the cell surface. Scale bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DPP10 Modulates Kv4.2 Channels—The same population of cells analyzed by immunofluorescence was used for electrophysiology. CHO cells transfected only with Kv4.2 were often fragile, producing unstable whole cell electrophysiological recordings, perhaps due to bulky endoplasmic reticulum retention of proteins. In more healthy cells, Kv4.2 currents tended to be very small. Fig. 2A shows records from a CHO cell transiently transfected with Kv4.2 cDNA. This particular cell had unusual large currents compared with other cells transfected with Kv4.2 alone. However, the kinetics and voltage dependence of the currents in this cell were similar to those in other cells expressing Kv4.2 alone. Fig. 2 (B–D) shows representative recordings of cells cotransfected with Kv4.2 cDNA and DPPIV, DPPX, or DPP10 cDNA, respectively. The peak currents with DPPX and DPP10 were significantly larger than those produced by Kv4.2 expression alone, yielding 6.7 and 5.9 times more current upon depolarization to 48 mV (Fig. 2E). In contrast to the large effects of DPPX and DPP10 on current levels, DPPIV coexpression produced only small increases in Kv4.2 currents (Fig. 2E). These observations are consistent with the results of Fig. 1, in which DPPX and DPP10, but not DPPIV, induced effective trafficking of Kv4.2 protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface.Fig. 2Modulating effects of DPPX, DPP10, and DPPIV on Kv4.2-mediated currents in CHO cells. Shown are Kv4.2-mediated A-type currents in CHO cells transfected with Kv4.2 cDNA alone (A) or with DPPIV (B), DPPX (C), or DPP10 (D) cDNA obtained by whole cell recordings under voltage clamp. The inset shows the pulse protocol. Cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of –82 mV and hyperpolarized for 1 s to –112 mV to remove channel inactivation, followed by depolarizing test pulses from –82 to 48 mV in increments of 10 mV. Note the different values of the scale bars of current magnitude during the test pulse, indicating notably larger current magnitude with DPPX or DPP10 coexpression. Peak current magnitude (Imax) is plotted against time to peak (tp) during depolarization to 48 mV in cells transfected with Kv4.2 cDNA alone or in combination with DPPIV, DPPX, or DPP10 (E). DPPX and DPP10 considerably increased current magnitude and decreased time to peak, whereas DPPIV yielded moderate effects for both parameters. The normalized conductance-voltage (G/Gmax) relation is shown for each population (mean ± S.E.; n = 7 for Kv4.2 alone and with DPPX and DPPIV and n = 6 with DPP10) (F). Data were fitted with Boltzmann functions. Kv4.2 alone and Kv4.2 coexpressed with DPPIV resulted in largely overlapping current-voltage plots. However, both DPPX and DPP10 similarly shifted the voltage dependence to hyperpolarizing potentials.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DPP10 and DPPX also had similar effects in modulating the kinetic properties and voltage dependence of Kv4.2 channels. Time to peak of A-type K+ currents produced by Kv4.2 when expressed alone was 11.4 ms at 48 mV for the example illustrated in the Fig. 2A and averaged 11.8 ± 3.7 ms (n = 6). Coexpression with DPPX or DPP10 produced a large reduction in time to peak: 3.8 and 2.2 ms at 48 mV for DPPX and DPP10, respectively, for the examples shown in Fig. 2 (C and D) and an average of 3.8 ± 0.4 ms (n = 7) and 3.5 ± 0.9 ms (n = 6), respectively.A key feature of the effects of DPPX on Kv4 channels is the acceleration of the rate of macroscopic inactivation of the transient A-type current during a depolarizing step (9Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Amarillo Y. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ma Y. Mo W. Goldberg E.M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Neubert T.A. Rudy B. Neuron. 2003; 37: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This is an important effect of this protein because the native A-type K+ current in neurons inactivates at faster rates than the currents expressed by Kv4 proteins alone (9Nadal M.S. Ozaita A.

(Lond.). 2001; 537: 801-809Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). DPP10 produced an even stronger effect than DPPX on inactivation rates (Fig. 2). The average t0.5 (time to achieve half-inactivation) when depolarized to 18 mV was 32.4 ± 6.7 ms for Kv4.2 plus DPPX (n = 7) and 17.1 ± 4.7 ms for Kv4.2 plus DPP10 (n = 5), both significantly faster than Kv4.2 alone at 61.5 ± 23 ms (n = 7).To further characterize the difference in inactivation rates of the currents expressed by Kv4.2 subunits in the presence of DPPX or DPP10 protein, we fitted the decline of the transient Kv4-mediated current with exponential functions. A double exponential was required to fit the decline of the currents in the presence of DPPX and DPP10, as reported previously for Kv4-mediated currents with DPPX in Xenopus oocytes and for the transient K+ current in many neurons (9Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Amarillo Y. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Ma Y. Mo W. Goldberg E.M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Neubert T.A. Rudy B.

In comparing DPP10 with DPPX, we found that the fast time constant was significantly different (18.8 ± 4.9 ms for DPP10 (n = 5) and 35.0 ± 5.9 ms for DPPX (n = 7), p < 0.001). Differences in the slow time constant and contributions of each component did not reach statistical significance, suggesting that the difference in inactivation rates in the presence of DPP10 or DPPX is due mainly to changes in the rate of the process(es) underlying the fast time constant of inactivation. However, the mechanism responsible for this difference in inactivation rates is currently unknown.DPPX and DPP10 also dra"

Previously, Hu proteins have been shown to enhance the stabilization and/or translation of target mRNAs, such as p21 (CIP1), by binding to AU-rich elements in untranslated regions (UTRs). In this study, we show that Hu induces p21 expression, cell cycle arrest, and neuronal differentiation in mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells. p21 expression is also up-regulated during Me2SO-induced differentiation in N1E-115 cells and is controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms through its 3′-UTR. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of Hu functions, we used a proteomics strategy to isolate Hu-interacting proteins and identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K. hnRNP K also specifically binds to CU-rich sequences in p21 mRNA 3′-UTR and represses its translation in both nonneuronal and neuronal cells. Further, using RNA interference experiments, we show that the Hu-p21 pathway contributes to the regulation of neurite outgrowth and proliferation in N1E-115 cells, and this pathway is antagonized by hnRNP K.

Cell differentiation and development are achieved by differential gene expression, which is regulated by various mechanisms such as protein degradation, modification, transcription, and post-transcriptional regulation. Although post-translational protein modification and transcription have been thought to play central roles in gene regulation during the process of development, recent studies have revealed the important role of the post-transcriptional regulation of messenger RNA (1.Okabe M.

Both Hu proteins and Elav contain three well characterized RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that mediate specific and high affinity binding to the AU-rich elements of target mRNAs (20.Fan X.C.

Interestingly, most of the target mRNAs encode proteins that play important roles in the regulation of differentiation and proliferation. These findings suggest that the simultaneous regulation of the expression of these mRNAs by neuronal Hu may play an important role in the timing control of growth/differentiation switching. Key events in terminal differentiation, such as neurite outgrowth, are always accompanied by withdrawal from the cell cycle. An important regulator of this event is cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (e.g. p21 and p27 associate with several cyclin-dependent kinase-cyclin complexes to suppress cell cycle-promoting activity). Several papers have reported that p21 gene expression is up-regulated during neuronal differentiation. In PC12 cells, for instance, nerve growth factor induces p21 expression, accompanied by neurite extension (28.Dobashi Y. Kudoh T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23031-23037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29.Erhardt J.A. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23517-23523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, p21 expression is regulated not only at the transcriptional level, but also at the post-transcriptional level (30.Gorospe M. Wang X. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1400-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The stability of p21 mRNA is controlled by Hu proteins that specifically bind to AU-rich element in its 3′-UTR (21.Joseph B. Orlian M. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20511-20516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30.Gorospe M. Wang X. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1400-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To reveal the molecular mechanisms of the timing control of neuronal differentiation by Hu, we isolated and identified Hu-associated proteins. Here, we show that the RNA-binding protein hnRNP K directly interacts with Hu, represses the translation of p21 mRNA by binding to its 3′-UTR sequence, and antagonizes the action of the Hu protein, inducing cell cycle arrest and neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells. Our findings suggest that the activity balance of these two functionally antagonizing RNA-binding proteins involved in p21 mRNA post-transcriptional regulation is important to switch from proliferation to differentiation.

Purification of Hu-associated Proteins—FLAG-tagged mouse HuB or GFP was overexpressed in 293T cells using recombinant adenovirus prepared as described previously (31.He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar). After 2 days, whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Hu-associated proteins were immunopurified using an anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma). After washing four times, the associated proteins were eluted by treatment with 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluted products were separated with SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie or silver staining. Specific bands were excised from the gel and digested with trypsin. A MALDI-TOF mass analysis was performed by APRO Science (Tokushima, Japan). Recombinant Proteins, in Vitro Translation, and GST Pull-down Assays—Recombinant GST- or His-tagged mouse hnRNP K, HuB, and HuC fusion proteins were produced by transforming BL21 competent cells, followed by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and purification by nickel chelation or glutathione chromatography. Full-length and mutant hnRNP K RNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro using PURESYSTEM classic (Post Genome Institute Co., Ltd.) with l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Ten micrograms of GST-fused Hu or GST protein was incubated with 35S-labeled, in vitro translated, hnRNP K deletion mutant proteins or the indicated cell lysates in the binding buffer (PBS with 0.1% Nonidet P40 and protease inhibitor mixture) for 2 h at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h; the beads were then washed three times with binding buffer and resolved using 10–15% SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were analyzed by autoradiography or Western blotting. Biotin Pull-down Assay—40 μg of 293T or PC12 cell lysate or 1 μgof GST-hnRNP K or HuB protein was incubated with 0.1 μg of biotinylated and in vitro transcribed p21 3′-UTR RNA, together with 0–0.2 μg of nonbiotinylated p21 3′-UTR RNA, for 2 h at 4 °C. RNA-protein complexes were isolated with streptavidin beads. After washing three times, the samples were subjected to Western blot analysis to detect Hu or hnRNP K protein using anti-Hu human serum (1:2000; a gift from Dr. Robert Darnell), anti-hnRNP K polyclonal antibody (1:500), or anti-hnRNP K/J antibody 3C2 (1:500; ImmuQuest). Anti-Hu serum is reactive with HuB, -C, and -D. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—293T cells were co-transfected with Myc-hnRNP K and FLAG-HuB using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants, which included the FLAG fusion proteins, were immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) pretreated with or without 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with lysis buffer, the proteins were eluted by boiling in loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to an Immobilon P-membrane (Millipore Corp.). The blots were probed with anti-Myc monoclonal (1:1000 dilution; Sigma) and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (1:500; Sigma) or anti-hnRNP K polyclonal antibodies (1:500). Rabbit anti-hnRNP K polyclonal antibody was made by immunizing animals with a full-length GST-hnRNP K bacterial fusion protein. Immunoprecipitation and RT-PCR—Six-well plates of NIH3T3 cells were infected with recombinant retroviral expression vectors, pMY including FLAG alone, FLAG-HuB or FLAG-hnRNP K cDNA, and IRES GFP (a gift from Dr. T. Kitamura) (32.Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours post-infection, the infected cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation products were prepared as described using a cytosol extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES, KOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and RNasin (Promega)). The amount of cell lysates was normalized according to the total protein. RT-PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primers specific for p21 (5′-GTCTAGACAAGAGAAAACCCTGAAG-3′, 5′-GTCTAGATTAAGTTTGGAGACTGGG-3′) or GAPDH (5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′) mRNA. The products of RT-PCR were resolved by 8% PAGE and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Real time RT-PCR was performed using a MX3000P (Stratagene) with SYBR green (TaKaRa). PCR primer was 5′-GGGATCCATGTCCAATCCTGGTGAT-3′, 5′-GGGATCCACACAGAGTGAGGGCTAA-3′ for p21 or as above for GAPDH. RNA Gel Shift Assay—In vitro transcribed 32P-labeled RNA probes (∼10,000 cpm) for p21 3′-UTR were incubated with hnRNP K fusion proteins at final concentrations of 0, 10, 50, or 100 nm in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) at room temperature for 30 min. RNA-protein complexes were applied to 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE at room temperature. Bands were visualized by autoradiography. Luciferase Reporter Assay—293T or N1E-115 cells were cultured in 12-well plates and transfected with a Renilla luciferase construct with or without p21 3′-UTR together with increasing amounts of pcDNA-Myc-hnRNP K expression vector using FuGENE 6. Firefly luciferase or β-galactosidase vector was co-transfected as an internal control. The total amount of transfected DNA was equalized with control pcDNA-Myc vectors. Luciferase activities were measured according to the recommended procedures for the Dual luciferase assay system (Promega). A Berthold Lumat LB9507 luminometer was used for detection. Cell Growth and Neurite Outgrowth Assay—N1E-115 cells were culture in 6-well plates and co-transfected with 1 μg of pCXN2-Myc-GFP, -FLAG-HuB, -Myc-hnRNP K, or -Myc-p21 together with 0.2 μg of pCXN2-mRFP, carrying a CAG promoter (33.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar), as a marker of transfected cells. The cells were cultured for 4 days after transfection. The number of cells with long neurites in monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-positive cells was then counted (neurite growth assay). The relative cell number represents the ratio of cells on day 2 to those on day 1 (cell growth) BrdUrd Incorporation—48 h after transfection, N1E-115 cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml BrdUrd (Sigma) for 4 h. Cells attached to polyornithine-coated coverslips were washed once in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. The cells were rinsed with PBS two times and incubated in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After rinsing in PBS, the cells were incubated with 1% H2O2 in PBS followed by two rinses in PBS and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-FLAG (M2) or anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:5000 (Sigma) in tyramide signal amplification-blocking reagent. After washing three times in PBS, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, followed by observation using a tyramide signal amplification fluorescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After treatment with 1 n HCl at 50 °C for 20 min, the samples were washed twice in PBS and incubated with anti-BrdUrd antibody at 1:200 (Fitzgerald) overnight. For the secondary antibody, Alexa 568 (A-21099) was used. After washing three times in PBS, the samples were mounted on slides and examined using a universal fluorescence microscope (Axiophot; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). RNA Interference—Short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes for p21 and the recommended negative control were obtained from Ambion in annealed and purified forms. Transfection of the siRNA duplexes was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Three microliter of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent with 100 pmol of siRNA duplexes, 0.5 μg of FLAG-HuB, and 0.1 μg of mRFP expression vectors were used per well (12-well plate). After transfection, the cells were subjected to a cell growth assay, a neurite outgrowth assay, or a Western blot analysis (34.Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar). Isolation of Hu-associated Protein Complexes—As a first step in our study of the biological functions of neuronal Hu proteins in vivo, we tried to identify Hu-interacting proteins. For this purpose, we isolated protein complexes containing HuB from 293T whole cell extracts using FLAG tag affinity purification. The protein fractions from control GFP- or FLAG-tagged HuB (FLAG-HuB) that had been overexpressed by recombinant adenoviruses were separated using SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining (Fig. 1A). Several bands were found specifically in the lane of the FLAG-HuB immune complexes, compared with the control lane. Three major bands were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). A protein with a molecular mass of about 60 kDa appeared to be the RNA-binding protein hnRNP K, whereas the other two bands representing proteins with a molecular mass of about 70 and 45 kDa were the arginine methyltransferase skb-1 and nuclear protein NF45, respectively. We were particularly interested in hnRNP K, because this protein is a translational repressor for mRNA containing differentiation control elements (DICEs), such as 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) mRNA (4.Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the direct interaction between hnRNP K and Hu proteins, we performed a GST pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In vitro, purified HuC- or HuB-bacterially prepared fusion protein was tested for binding to glutathione beads prebound with GST alone or GST-hnRNP K. The results indicated that HuC associated with hnRNP K, and the interaction between hnRNP K and HuC was also detected after the treatment with RNase A, although the interaction was partly affected by RNase A (Fig. 1B). A similar result was obtained by using HuB fusion protein (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that hnRNP K and two proteins of Hu family are capable of interacting directly in the absence of an RNA intermediate. To confirm the interaction between hnRNP K and Hu proteins in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. FLAG-GFP or FLAG-HuB with Myc-tagged hnRNP K (Myc-hnRNP K) were overexpressed in 293T cells, and whole lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody-beads, followed by Western blot analysis with an antibody against Myc tag or hnRNP K. Myc-hnRNP K and endogenous hnRNP K, expressed in 293T cells, were both co-precipitated equally well with transfected FLAG-HuB protein but not with the GFP control protein (Fig. 1C). The specificity of the immunoprecipitation study was further confirmed using anti-FLAG antibody-beads preincubated with FLAG peptide. These results indicated that hnRNP K interacts directly with Hu proteins both in vivo and in vitro. We further examined the interaction between hnRNP K and HuB using truncated constructs in a pull-down assay. The truncated versions of hnRNP K, as shown in Fig. 2A, were translated in vitro, subjected to a GST pull-down assay, and visualized by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2A, the spacer domain of hnRNP K containing an RGG box (Kd5) was sufficient to produce as robust an interaction with HuB as was full-length hnRNP K. We also demonstrated that both HuBM and HuBS, splicing isoforms of HuB, bound to hnRNP K. In contrast, no single hnRNP K deletion construct without an RGG box was able to mediate a strong interaction with HuB. Next, by using two in vitro translated C-terminal domains with or without the RGG box (Kd2 and Kd3, respectively), we mapped the interaction regions in HuB that bind to hnRNP K. The resulting data indicated that the Kd2 interacted with all HuB truncated mutants except the RRM2 domain alone (Fig. 2B). hnRNP K Repressed p21 mRNA Translation—hnRNP K has been shown to bind to CU-rich DICE in the 3′-UTR of Lox mRNA and silence its translation (4.Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). On the other hand, neuronal Hu as well as HuR have been shown to bind to an AU-rich element in the 3′-UTR of p21 mRNA. Interestingly, three potential consensus binding sites (CU-rich regions) for hnRNP K exist downstream of the Hu-binding element and the CU-rich regions and have been shown not to bind to Hu (21.Joseph B. Orlian M. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20511-20516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We examined whether hnRNP K might also bind to these elements in p21 mRNA 3′-UTR (Fig. 3A). To study the interaction between hnRNP K and p21 mRNA 3′-UTR in vivo, we performed a combined immunoprecipitation/RT-PCR assay. NIH3T3 cells were infected with retrovirus expressing FLAG alone, FLAG-HuB, or FLAG-hnRNP K, and each FLAG-tagged protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody-beads, followed by RT-PCR with p21- or GAPDH-specific primers. PCR products were resolved by 8% PAGE or 2% agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3B). Specific 180-bp bands for p21 mRNA were detected in the FLAG-HuB and FLAG-hnRNP K lanes but not in the control or RT (–) lanes. In contrast, GAPDH mRNA was not detected in any of the immunoprecipitants. To identify hnRNP K binding sequence in the p21 mRNA 3′-UTR, a gel shift assay was performed using four in vitro transcribed 20–40-bp RNA fragments (Hu binding site, CU-rich1, CU-rich2, and CU-rich3 regions). hnRNP K interacted with CU-rich2 with a high affinity and with CU-rich3, whereas no detectable binding to the Hu binding site or CU-rich1 was detected (Fig. 3C). To assess whether endogenously expressed Hu proteins or hnRNP K were also able to interact with the p21 mRNA 3′-UTR, we performed a biotin pull-down assay with extracts from 293T or PC12 cells using synthesized biotin-labeled RNA (Fig. 3D). In the 293T cells, which endogenously express hnRNP K but not neuronal Hu proteins, a robust association of hnRNP K with biotinylated p21 mRNA 3′-UTR was detected, and this association decreased upon competition with increased amounts of nonbiotinylated transcripts. The same assay using extracts from PC12 cells, which express both Hu proteins and hnRNP K, showed that both endogenous Hu proteins and hnRNP K bound specifically with p21 mRNA 3′-UTR (Fig. 3D and data not shown). These results indicated that hnRNP K binds directly to specific sites in p21 mRNA 3′-UTR in vitro and in vivo. Next, to assess whether HuB and hnRNP K compete at the level of RNA bonding, we carried out a biotin pull-down assay using AU element of the Hu binding site or AU-CU element, containing both Hu binding and hnRNP K binding (CU-rich1 and CU-rich2) sites of p21 mRNA 3′-UTR. These results showed that GST-hnRNP K interacted with AU-CU element but not with AU element and control beads. Interestingly, GST-hnRNP K was pulled down with the AU element in the presence of GST-HuB, and furthermore equally strong interactions were detected between HuB and AU-CU RNA element in the presence or absence of hnRNP K (Fig. 3E). These data indicated that HuB-hnRNP K interaction did not interfere with the RNA-binding ability of HuB, and as a result, HuB, hnRNP K, and RNA formed an RNA-protein-protein triple complex. To investigate whether hnRNP K mediates the translational silencing of p21 mRNA, we next used a chimeric reporter gene assay system containing Renilla luciferase cDNA fused with the p21 mRNA 3′-UTR sequence. Three Renilla luciferase reporter constructs containing a 1.2-kb full-length (Luc-FL) sequence or a 0.3-kb fragment (Luc-ΔCU) with either the deletion of the CU-rich regions or Luc as a negative control were placed under control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. A firefly luciferase expression vector under the control of an SV40 promoter was co-transfected as an internal control (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, the luciferase activity of Luc-FL was repressed by hnRNP K in a dose-dependent m"
https://openalex.org/W2063339343,"In this study, we demonstrate the infiltration of blood-derived monocytic cells and their morphologic transformation into microglia in zones of acute, anterograde (Wallerian) axonal degeneration induced by entorhinal cortex lesion (ECL). ECL was performed in mice which had received green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transduced bone marrow grafts allowing identification of blood-derived elements within the brain. While in the unlesioned hemisphere GFP+ cells were restricted to perivascular and leptomeningeal sites, many round fluorescent cells appeared in hippocampal zones of axonal degeneration at 24 h post lesion (hpl). Within 72 hpl, these GFP+ cells acquired ramified, microglia-like morphologies, which persisted for at least 7 days post ECL. Differentiation of GFP+ cells into glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ astrocytes was never observed. To exclude that this recruitment is an artifact of irradiation or bone marrow transplantation, the fluorescent cell tracker 6-carboxylfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) was injected into spleens of normal mice 1 day before ECL. Again, fluorescent cells appeared at the lesion site and along the layers of axonal degeneration at 48 hpl and CFDA+/MAC-1+, cells exhibited amoeboid and ramified morphologies. Thus, blood-derived cells infiltrate not only the site of mechanical lesion, but also the layers of anterograde axonal degeneration, where they readily transform into microglia-like elements. A role for infiltrating leukocytes in facilitating or modulating postlesional plasticity, e.g., by phagocytosis of growth-inhibiting myelin should now be considered. Moreover, monocytic cells may serve as vehicles to transport therapeutic substances such as neurotrophic factors or caspase inhibitors to zones of axonal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2003980854,"Because sex steroids regulate the life span of bone cells by modulating cytoplasmic kinase activity via a nongenotropic action of their classical receptors, we have explored the possibility that the vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR) might exhibit similar nongenotropic actions. We report that the conformationally flexible full VDR agonist, 1α,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3), and the 6-s-cis-locked 1α,25(OH)2-lumisterol3 (JN) analog, also acting through the VDR but with poor transcriptional activity, protected murine osteoblastic or osteocytic cells from apoptosis. This effect was reproduced in HeLa cells transiently transfected with either wild type VDR or a mutant consisting of only the VDR ligand binding domain. The VDR ligand binding domain bound [3H]1α,25(OH)2D3 as effectively as wild type VDR but did not induce vitamin D response element-mediated transcription. The anti-apoptotic effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and the 6-s-cis-locked 1α,25(OH)2-lumisterol3 analog in calvaria cells were blocked by three cytoplasmic kinase inhibitors: Src kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP1), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor Wortmannin, and the JNK kinase inhibitor SP600125. However, inhibition of p38 with SB203580 or ERK with either U0126 or a transfected dominant negative MEK did not interfere with these anti-apoptotic actions. Further, 1α,25(OH)2D3 induced rapid (5 min) association of VDR with Src kinase in OB-6 cells. Finally, actinomycin D or cycloheximide prevented the anti-apoptotic effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3, indicating that transcriptional events are also required. These findings suggest that nongenotropic modulation of kinase activity is also a general property of the VDR and that ligands that activate nongenotropic signals, but lack transcriptional activity, display different biological profiles from the steroid hormone 1α,25(OH)2D3.

ERβ, or AR), attenuate the apoptosis of several different cell types, including osteoblasts and osteocytes, by rapidly activating the Src/Shc/ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and down-regulating the JNK signaling pathways. This effect requires only the ligand binding, not the DNA binding, domain of the receptor, and, unlike its classical transcriptional action, it is eliminated by nuclear targeting of the receptor (9.Kousteni S.

Activation of ERKs leads to the rapid translocation of the kinases into the nucleus where they phosphorylate common transcription factors like Elk-1, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-β, and cAMP-response element-binding protein. These transcription factors in turn up-regulate gene expression, as exemplified by the up-regulation of the early growth response-1 protein gene, an ERK/serum response element target gene. Likewise, suppression of the JNK signaling cascade by sex steroids leads to down-regulation of c-Jun expression (10.Kousteni S. Han L. Chen J.-R. Almeida M. Plotkin L.I. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1651-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We have earlier used a ligand that potently and selectively activates nongenotropic actions of the classical ER or AR and thereby activates kinases and their downstream transcription factors and target genes with only minimal effects on classical estrogen response element-mediated genotropic transcription.

In the present study, we have followed up these preliminary observations and show that 1α,25(OH)2D3, as well as other natural metabolites of vitamin D and synthetic analogs of 1α,25(OH)2D3 incapable of inducing vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE)-mediated transcription, attenuates osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis. Chemicals—1α,25(OH)2D3 and the vitamin D3 metabolites 24R,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 were obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The 1α,25(OH)2D3 analogs 1α,25(OH)-dihydrotachysterol3 (JB), 1α,25(OH)2-trans-isotachysterol3 (JD), 1α,25(OH)2-7-dehydrocholesterol (JM), 1α,25(OH)2-lumisterol (JN), 1β,25(OH)2D3 (HL), and (23S)-25-dehydro-1α-dihydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone (MK) were obtained from Dr. William H.

Osteoblastic and osteocytic cells were treated at 80% confluence with either vehicle or the appropriate kinase inhibitor for 30 min prior to the addition of 1α,25(OH)2D3 or the indicated 1α,25(OH)2D3 metabolites or its synthetic analogs for an additional 1 h in the presence of 10% serum. To induce apoptosis, etoposide was added to the cells (final concentration of 50 and 100 μm for calvaria or MLO-Y4 cells and OB-6 cells, respectively), and the cultures were continued for 6 h. CV-1 monkey kidney cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106 cells/150-mm culture dishes and cultured in minimal Eagle's medium with Earl's buffered salts and non-essential amino acids (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA). Cos-1 monkey kidney cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/150-mm culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids—pcDNA plasmid was purchased from Invitrogen. The human VDR and RXR plasmids were obtained from D. McDonnell (Duke University, Durham, NC) and D. Mangelsdorf (University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), respectively. The nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP) was obtained by attaching the SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization sequence to the N terminus of the cDNA construct encoding GFP (7.Plotkin L.I.

Katzenellenbogen (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). The wild type and dominant negative MEK plasmids were donated by Natalie Ahn from the University of Colorado at Boulder (23.Mansour S.J.

The VDRE-secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter was constructed by removing the promoter and untranslated regions from the osteocalcin VDRE-human growth hormone reporter and cloning into the pSEAP2-Basic plasmid (Stratagene, Palo Alto, CA) (24.Liu Y.Y. Collins E.D. Norman A.W. Peleg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3336-3345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This reporter contains the osteocalcin gene VDRE (235-219 bp with respect to the transcription start site) and the calcitonin promoter, having both the Octomer element (167-149 bp) and the Sp1 element (81-76 bp). An N-terminal fluorescent tag was positioned in-frame with the wtVDR or VDR ligand binding domain (LBD-VDR) by using PCR-generated restriction enzyme-flanked inserts included into the pECFP-Nuc plasmid (Stratagene). The full-length wtVDR (residues 4-427) was inserted into pECFP-Nuc, and the nuclear localization signal was removed. The LBD-VDR residues 119-427 were inserted into the pECFP-NUC plasmid, and the nuclear localization signal was also removed. Expression of the plasmid constructs was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy. Transient Transfections—HeLa cells were transiently transfected at 80% confluency with 0.1 μg of nuclear GFP and 0.1 μg of either ERα, wtVDR, VDR 119-C, RXR, or pCDNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Cells were allowed to recover overnight and then treated with vehicle, 1α,25(OH)2D3, or the indicated 1α,25(OH)2D3 analog 1 h prior to exposure to stimulation of apoptosis by etoposide. Subsequently, etoposide was added to a final concentration of 100 μm, and the cultures were continued (in the presence of the D-compounds or vehicle) for an additional 6 h. Transient transfection of CV-1 cells was performed at 60% confluency and involved 10 min of pretreatment with 0.2 mg/ml DEAE-dextran (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Pretreated cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 μg/well pcDNA3, wt hVDR, or the appropriate mutants of hVDR and 0.5 μg/well of the VDRE-Luc reporter. Transfected cells were incubated in 80 μm chloroquine in minimal Eagle's medium with Earl's buffered salts and nonessential amino acids (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) with 4.5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum for 4 h followed by the same culture medium without chloroquine for 24 h. Twenty-eight hours after transfection, the cell medium was replaced with the same medium containing vehicle or 1α,25(OH)2D3. Twenty-two hours later, cell medium was harvested to measure secreted alkaline phosphatase using the Phospha-Light™ kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The data are presented as dose response curves of the reporter with raw luminometer units plotted versus the log dose of ligand. All experiments were carried out on quadruplicate samples with data expressed as the mean ± S.E. Quantification of Apoptotic Cells in Vitro—HeLa cell apoptosis was quantified by direct visualization of changes in nuclear morphology as previously described (6.Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T.

Visualization of pyknotic or fragmented nuclei was facilitated by co-transfections of cells plated on glass coverslips with nuclear GFP. The percentage of apoptosis was determined by determining the nuclear morphology in 200-500 transfected (fluorescent) cells. Apoptosis of calvaria cells, OB-6 osteoblastic cells, and MLO-Y4 osteocytes was quantified by trypan blue staining. Equilibrium Saturation Binding Assay—Cos-1 cells were grown to 80% confluency and were then transfected with 3 μg of pcDNA3, wt hVDR, or the appropriate mutants of hVDR as described for CV-1 cells. Sixty-six hours following transfection, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping in TED (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) hypotonic buffer with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Cos-1 cell lysate (0.2 ml) was incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]1α,25(OH)2D3 106 Ci/mmol in the presence or absence of excess nonradioactive 1α,25(OH)2D3 for 4 h at 0 °C. Samples were performed in triplicate. After equilibrium was established, 200 μl of 50% hydroxyapatite solution in TED was added and washed three times in 1 ml of TED plus 0.5% Triton-X100. Bound [3H]1α,25(OH)2D3 was eluted with 1 ml of ethanol, and the tritium content was determined in 7 ml of Liquiscint™ scintillation mixture using a Beckman LS6500. The dissociation constant KD for binding of 1α,25(OH)2D3 to a given VDR construct was determined by non-linear regression of the curve generated by plotting specific binding versus concentration of [3H]1α,25(OH)2D3 using a one-site binding equation (26.Bula C.M. Bishop J.E. Ishizuka S. Norman A.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1788-1796PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of the Src/VDR Complex and Western Blot Analysis—OB-6 osteoblastic cells were treated with 1α,25(OH)2D3 for the indicated periods of time, and cells were lyzed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.14 units/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm NA orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. Cell lysates were collected and were either used to determine total protein concentration with the Bio-Rad 500-0001 protein assay kit or were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-VDR antibody N-20 (SC-1009; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C. An equal amount of goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (SC-2004; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the lysate for 30 min, followed by the addition of 50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were size fractionated with SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. Immunoblotting was performed using a mouse monoclonal anti-v-Src antibody (1:2000, catalogue number OP07; Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA). The primary antibody was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and enhanced chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 in OB-6 cells was analyzed by immunoblotting. The antibodies used were a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK1/2 and a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing total ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed by analysis of variance, and the Student-Newman-Kleuss method was used to estimate the level of significance of differences between means. Attenuation of HeLa and Calvaria Cell Apoptosis by 1α,25(OH)2D3 and Other Vitamin D Metabolites—To confirm our earlier observations indicating that 1α,25(OH)2D3 attenuates apoptosis by a VDR- or RXR-dependent mechanism, we performed a dose response study of the effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 in HeLa cells transiently transfected with VDR or RXR. Pretreatment of the cells for 1 h with the hormone dose dependently attenuated HeLa cell apoptosis induced by 6 h of treatment with etoposide (Fig. 1A). As in our earlier studies, 1α,25(OH)2D3 had no effect on the apoptosis of HeLa cells transfected with an empty vector. In full support of the findings for the HeLa cells, 1α,25(OH)2D3 as well as 24,25(OH)2D3 or 25(OH)D3, but not vehicle, protected primary cultures of osteoblastic cells derived from murine calvaria from apoptosis induced by etoposide. As in the case of the HeLa cells, this effect was dose dependent at concentrations ranging from 10−12 to 10−7 m (Fig. 1B). The anti-apoptotic effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 (at 10−8 m) was reproduced in both the OB-6 osteoblastic murine cell line and murine MLO-Y4 osteocytic cells, and it was comparable with the anti-apoptotic effect of estradiol in these cell types (Fig. 1C). Synthetic Vitamin D Analogs Exhibit Potent Anti-apoptotic Effects That Are Independent of Their Relative Binding Affinity for the VDR—Numerous synthetic 1α,25(OH)2D3 analogs have been previously classified as genotropic or nongenotropic based on their ability to induce the transcription of VDRE-containing genes like osteocalcin via VDR-VDRE interactions or to induce rapid calcium influxes in the intestine and numerous isolated cell types, via rapid phosphorylation of ERKs (13.Song X. Bishop J.E. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Using six such synthetic analogs (Fig. 2 and Table I), we proceeded to examine whether the anti-apoptotic effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 result from genotropic or nongenotropic actions of the hormone. As shown in Fig. 3A, the 6-s-cis-locked analog JN prevented etoposide-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner very similar to the dose response curve for 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1A). Another 6-s-cis-locked analog, JM, also prevented etoposide-induced apoptosis of calvaria cells as effectively as JN and 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 3B). Both analogs are potent agonists for the rapid membrane-mediated effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 but associate poorly with the classical VDR under equilibrium binding conditions (13.Song X. Bishop J.E.

Additionally, the analog HL, an epimer of 1α,25(OH)2D3 (28.Norman A.W. Bouillon R. Farach-Carson M.C. Bishop J.E. Zhou L.X. Nemere I. Zhao J. Muralidharan K.R. Okamura W.H. J. Biol.

Steroids. 2002; 67: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), was able to prevent apoptosis when used either alone or in combination with JM or JN. On the other hand, the analog MK, which is an antagonist of the nuclear actions of the VDR (29.Miura D. Manabe K. Gao Q. Norman A.W. Ishizuka S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was ineffective by itself but was able to block the protective effects of analogs JM and JN (Fig. 3C) and 1α,25(OH)2D3(Fig. 3D) in calvarial cells. The 6-s-trans-locked analogs JB and JD, which are weak agonists of both genotropic and nongenotropic actions, also exhibited a modest anti-apoptotic effect in calvaria cells (Fig. 3D) (27.Norman A.W. Okamura W.H. Hammond M.W. Bishop J.E. Dormanen M.C. Bouillon R. Van Baelen H. Ridall A.L. Daane E. Khoury R. Farach-Carson M.C. Mol.

Similar to the cis-analogs, HL prevented apoptosis when used alone or in combination with JB, JD, or 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 3D).

Conversely, the overproduction of these molecules is associated with several disease pathologies, including atherosclerosis and obesity. The human acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 2 gene superfamily comprises seven members, four of which have been previously implicated in the synthesis of di- or triacylglycerol. The remaining 3 members comprise an X-linked locus and have not been characterized. We describe here the expression of DGAT2 and the three X-linked genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains virtually devoid of neutral lipids. All four gene products mediate the synthesis of triacylglycerol; however, two of the X-linked genes act as acyl-CoA wax alcohol acyltransferases (AWAT 1 and 2) that predominantly esterify long chain (wax) alcohols with acyl-CoA-derived fatty acids to produce wax esters. AWAT1 and AWAT2 have very distinct substrate preferences in terms of alcohol chain length and fatty acyl saturation. The enzymes are expressed in many human tissues but predominate in skin. In situ hybridizations demonstrate a differentiation-specific expression pattern within the human sebaceous gland for the two AWAT genes, consistent with a significant role in the composition of sebum.

Understanding the metabolic pathways of triglyceride (TG) synthesis and the roles of the enzymes involved in these reactions may hasten the development of therapeutic interventions by clarifying the pathophysiological processes of these diseases. Diacylglycerol is esterified to triglyceride by an acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) reaction. There are at least two independent mammalian enzymes known to catalyze this reaction, DGAT1 (8Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J.

DGAT1 is a member of the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) gene family with high levels of expression in human small intestine, colon, testis, and skeletal muscle. Mice lacking DGAT1 are surprisingly healthy with normal serum TAG but are resistant to diet-induced obesity, and have impaired sebaceous gland secretion (11Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C.

Subsequent to the discovery of DGAT1, DGAT2, the original member of a second human DGAT family, was identified by sequence similarity to lipid droplet proteins purified from Mortierella ramanniana, an oleaginous fungus (10Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38870-38876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). When expressed in insect cells, DGAT2 produces robust DGAT activity. DGAT2 shares no sequence similarity with DGAT1 and exhibits widespread expression in humans, with particularly high levels in liver and adipose tissue. Recently it has been shown that DGAT2–/– mice are severely depleted of triglycerides in their tissues and plasma, and possess poor skin barrier function, leading to early death (15Stone S.J. Myers H.M. Watkins S.M. Brown B.E. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11767-11776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). DGAT1 was unable to fully compensate for the loss of DGAT2, suggesting different roles for the two enzymes, and that DGAT2 is the enzyme responsible for the majority of TAG synthesis in mice. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DGA1 is the sole member of the DGAT2 gene family and is responsible for a large portion of triglyceride synthesis in this model organism (16Sandager L. Dahlqvist A. Banas A. Stahl U. Lenman M. Gustavsson M. Stymne S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This activity is supplemented by that of LRO1 (an ortholog of mammalian lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase), which also esterifies diacylglycerol but uses phospholipids as the acyl donor (19Oelkers P.

While their relative contribution varies with culture conditions, together these enzymes are responsible for about 98% of triglyceride synthesis in yeast. Deletion of ARE2, a steryl ester synthase, in conjunction with DGA1 and LRO1 eliminates all detectable TAG synthesis in yeast (17Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8877-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). As described here, we have utilized this “triple” deletion strain to study mammalian mediators of triglyceride metabolism such as the DGAT2 gene family. The human DGAT2 gene family consists of seven members: DGAT2 (10Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol.

Based on expression patterns, MGAT2 and MGAT3 were proposed as the major mediators of the intestinal MAG pathway. This pathway predominates in the intestine, whereby 2-monoacylglycerol, a product of partial lipolysis of triglyceride, is re-esterified using a fatty acyl-CoA to produce diacylglycerol. Moreover, the substrate preference of MGAT3 (49% sequence identity with human DGAT2) for 2-monoacylglycerol, compared with MGAT1 and MGAT2, which primarily use the sn-1 and sn-3 stereoisomers of MAG, implicates it as the major MGAT involved in intestinal fat absorption. Interestingly; however, there is no mouse ortholog of MGAT3. Murine MGAT2 is 46% identical to DGAT2 and is predominantly expressed in small intestine; however, human MGAT2 is more widespread (22Yen C.L. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol.

Metab. 2003; 285: E927-E937Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The MGATs also exhibit some DGAT activity and so the precise physiologic roles of these members of the DGAT2 gene family remain to be determined. Two other DGAT2 family members were originally reported (human DGAT candidate (hDC) genes 3 and 4, Ref. 10Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38870-38876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), and in this report we describe the final member of the human family, which we temporarily name DGA2. We have isolated and expressed cDNAs for these three genes and defined the substrate specificity, tissue expression patterns, and genealogic relationships of the enzymes, relative to human DGAT2. Markedly, all three enzymes are capable of esterifying DAG. However, the preferred alcohol substrates for two of them are long chain alcohols leading to the production of wax esters. We therefore rename these enzymes acyl-CoA wax alcohol acyltransferase (AWAT) 1 and 2. General—Molecular biology and yeast procedures were performed according to conventional protocols (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Complete (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose; YPD), synthetic complete (SC), and selective media (with galactose for cDNA expression) were prepared as described (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar). DNA-modifying reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. Human cDNA obtained as part of a Quick Screen cDNA panel of human tissues was obtained from Clontech (BD Biosciences). Skin cDNA was obtained from Invitrogen. IMAGE clones were obtained from Invitrogen. The Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and the Wizard PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega) were used to purify PCR products. The Prime-It random priming probe synthesis kit was obtained from Stratagene. [32P]dCTP, [9,10-3H(N)] and [1-14C]oleic acid, and [9,10-3H(N-)]palmitic acid were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [1-14C]Hexadecanol was obtained from Sigma. Automated DNA sequencing was performed at the Columbia University Cancer Center sequencing facility. Identification, Isolation, and Construction of Expression Plasmids with Human DGA2, hDC3, and hDC4—Human expressed sequence tags, genomic sequences, and predicted mRNA sequences for DGA2, hDC4, and hDC3 were obtained through a comprehensive BLAST search (29Altschul S.F.

Sequence comparisons were made across all currently available genome data sets at NCBI, Ensembl, UCSC, and Celera. The resultant sequences were then used to predict the coding sequence of the candidate genes, analyzed, and compared using DNAStrider (31Marck C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) and the ClustalW program in MacVector (32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Protein sequences were analyzed using the PROSITE and SMART analysis programs (33Bairoch A. Bucher P. K. H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D142-D144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length coding sequence for DGAT2 and hDC3 (GenBank™ accession number BG743707) were obtained as IMAGE cDNA clones in the pOTB7 (clone ID 4644380) and pCMV-SPORT6 (clone ID 4778300) vectors, respectively, and sequenced. Expression plasmids for the full-length human DGAT2 and hDC3 were engineered by subcloning the cDNA fragments into the EcoRI and XmaI, and EcoRI sites, respectively, of the yeast galactose inducible vector, pRS423-GP, downstream of the GAL 1/10 promoter (35Yang H. Cromley D. Wang H. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3980-3985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Using predicted cDNA-flanking regions, oligo primer pairs (Supplementary Table I) were designed to amplify the full-length coding region of DGA2 and hDC4 from thymus and lung cDNA, respectively. Amplification was performed with nested PCR using 2 ng of human cDNA, 10× PCR buffer, 1.75 mm MgCl2, 1.5 units of Taq polymerase, (TaqDNA polymerase, Invitrogen), 1 μm oligo primers, and 0.4 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in the Gene Amp PCR System 2400 (Applied Biosystems). PCR reactions were held at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 28 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. PCR products were gel-isolated, purified, TA-cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and transformed into chemically competent Top10 Escherichia coli (Rapid One Shot Chemical Transformation, Invitrogen). The full-length hDC4 was then subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pRS423-GP vector downstream of the GAL 1/10 promoter. The full-length DGA2 was subcloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the pRS423-GP vector, also downstream to the GAL 1/10 promoter. The full-length cDNA of DGA2 and hDC4 was completely sequenced. Yeast Strains and Transformation—Strains of S. cerevisiae with triple deletions of the DGA1, LRO1, and ARE2 (SCY2056, dga1Δ::URA3 lro1Δ::URA3 are2::LEU2) genes have been previously described to possess almost 99% depletion of triglyceride synthesis capabilities (17Oelkers P.

These strains were transformed with the human DGAT2, DGA2, hDC3, and hDC4 expression plasmids or pRS423-GP using lithium acetate followed by prototrophic selection (36Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of DGA2, hDC3, and hDC4—RNA was prepared from transformed yeast strains grown in SC-His + 2% galactose + 1% raffinose or SC-His + 2% dextrose (control). 10 μg of RNA from each culture was resolved on a 1.2% agarose, formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized in Quik-Hyb buffer (Stratagene) at 65 °C for 1 h with a random hexamer-primed, [32P]dCTP-labeled gene specific probe, generated with PCR (Table I).

A dilute inoculation (1:20–1:30) of a saturated culture grown in SC-His + 2% dextrose, followed by washes and resuspension in SC-His + 2% galactose + 1% raffinose, was grown at 30 °C to early logarithmic phase (A600 = 0.3–0.4). For in vivo DGAT assays, 10 ml of cells were added to 0.01 μCi/ml of [3H] or [14C]oleate or 0.25 μCi/ml of [3H]palmitate and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with shaking, washed twice with 0.5% tergitol and once with dH2O, and lyophilized. Lipids were extracted from dried cell pellets by cell wall hydrolysis (lyticase) and organic extraction (37Tinkelenberg A.H. Liu Y. Alcantara F. Khan S. Guo Z. Bard M. Sturley S.L. J. Biol.

For in vivo AWAT assays, cells were incubated with 70 nmol of hexadecanol, 30 nmol of [14C]hexadecanol, and 100 nmol of oleate. Lipids were resolved in hexane for 30 min followed by air drying for 15 min and subsequent development in toluene for 30 min. Each lane was cut according to lipid standards and counted by liquid scintillation. Assays were performed on three independent isolates of each genotype. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t tests. Lipid Accumulation—Assessment of the steady-state accumulation of lipids was performed by labeling a dilute inoculation (∼1:1000 of a saturated culture) of each strain into 10 ml of SC-His + 2% galactose + 1% raffinose with 0.01 μCi/ml [3H] or [14C]oleate or 0.25 μCi/ml [3H]palmitate and overnight growth at 30 °C. Cells were washed, and lipids were extracted and analyzed as described above. In Vitro Assay of DGAT and AWAT Activity and Substrate Specificity in Yeast Microsomes—A dilute inoculation of each strain into 500 ml of SC-His + 2% galactose + 1% raffinose was grown overnight at 30 °C into log phase. Cells were washed and lysed, and microsomes were prepared from a 100,000 × g spin, as previously described (39Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

In brief, microsomes (100 μg) were preincubated for 5 min at 37°in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5 containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, 160 μm dioleoylglycerol (in 5 μl acetone, final volume 200 μl). The reaction was initiated by the addition of [14C]oleoyl-CoA (10–20,000 dpm/nmol, 40 μm) and stopped after 10 min by the addition of 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Carrier TAG (10 μg) and internal standard ([3H]triolein, 30,000 dpm) were added followed by 0.8 ml of water to separate phases. The lower chloroform layer containing the lipids was removed, evaporated to dryness, resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform, and individual lipid classes separated on Varian chromatography paper using a hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (170:30:1, v/v) mobile phase. The spot corresponding to TG was cut out and counted. Similar assays were performed in triplicate for AWAT activity using at least three independent yeast microsome preparations. Initially (Table II), conditions were similar to those used for DGAT activities (i.e. 100 μg microsomes, assayed for 20 min in a final volume of 250 μl) with the substitution of 200 μm cetyl alcohol (unlabeled or 14C-labeled 10,000 dpm/nmol) for DAG. After separation by TLC, the spot corresponding to wax ester was cut out and counted. The AWAT assays were subsequently optimized to be linear with time and so that the reaction velocity was proportional to the amount of protein (Table III). For AWAT1 (DGA2), microsomes (10 μg) were preincubated for 5 min at 30 °C in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5 containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 μm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 200 μm wax alcohol in 2 μl of acetone). The reaction (final volume 250 μl) was initiated by the addition of [14C]oleoyl-CoA (40 μm) and stopped after 10 min by the addition of chloroform/methanol. Cholesteryl ester (15 μg) and [3H]cholesteryl ester (30,000 dpm) were added as carrier and internal standard, respectively and lipids extracted and separated as described above. Cholesteryl ester and wax ester have the same solubility in the mobile phase. The assay for AWAT2 (hDC4) was performed as AWAT1 except there was no preincubation and the assay length was 20 min. In some AWAT assays [14C]cetyl alcohol was used to follow esterification. Kill reactions and vector controls were included in all experiments. To assess substrate specificities, the various wax alcohols and acyl-CoAs were substituted for cetyl alcohol or oleoyl-CoA at the concentrations specified above.

Mouse microsomes were used as a positive control in both assays. Determination of Tissue Expression of DGAT2 Gene Family—Nested PCR was performed on all members of the DGAT2 gene family (except MGAT3) using 2 ng of human cDNA, 10× PCR buffer, 1.75 mm MgCl2, 2 μm dNTPs, 1.5 units of Taq polymerase, and 1 μm oligo primers (Supplementary Table I) designed to amplify a portion of the gene of interest. The initial PCR was held at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 28–30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The second PCR was conducted under similar conditions using 10% of the initial PCR product, 1 μm internal oligo primers, and a 72 °C extension time ranging from 40 s to 1 min for 28–30 cycles. Tissue expression for MGAT3 was determined using the above components held at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 53 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were resolved on a 1–2% agarose, 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide gel. Splice variants for hDC4 and MGAT1 were gel-isolated, purified, and sequenced. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed on mRNA from human adipose tissue (kindly provided by A. Ferrante, Columbia University, NY), with and without reverse transcriptase (SuperScriptII, Invitrogen), using 1 μg of RNA. 10% of the product was used as the template in the initial reaction of a nested PCR (as described above) designed to amplify a portion of each of the DGAT2 gene family members. Primers were similar to those utilized in experiments above except for the 2nd reaction using MGAT2 and MGAT3 (see Supplementary Table I). Expression of the DGAT2 gene family in skin was determined via standard and nested PCR as described above, using 2 ng of human skin cDNA and primers specific to each gene (Supplementary Table I). In situ hybridization was performed on freshly cut human scalp frozen sections using antisense probes for DGA2, hDC3, hDC4 and counterpart sense probe controls using standard procedures. Gene-specific PCR primer pairs described in Supplementary Table I were used to amplify templates from the pRS423-GP vector harboring each cDNA insert. The resulting PCR products (∼1 kb for DGA2, and ∼0.5 kb for hDC3 and hDC4) were ligated to the pCRII dual promoter vector (T7 and SP6) using the TA-cloning kit (Invitrogen). After sequencing to determine the orientation of the insert, the vector was linearized using either BamHI (T7, sense) or XhoI (SP6, antisense). Subsequently, in vitro transcription and DIG-labeling reactions were carried out following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Finally, the DIG-labeled RNA probes were ethanol-precipitated, quantified, and tested for alkaline phosphatase activity on nitrocellulose membranes to determine the optimal concentration for both sense and antisense probes. For hybridization, the slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/1× phosphate-buffered saline, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by acetylation using acetic anhydride and subsequent washing in phosphate-buffered saline. After prehybridization in hybridization buffer (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at 58 °C, the probes were added and the slides incubated overnight at the"

RNA-splicing FTDP-17 mutations alter the wild-type ∼50:50 3-repeat (3R) to 4-repeat (4R) tau isoform ratio, usually resulting in an excess of 4R tau. To examine further how splicing mutations might cause dysfunction by misregulation of microtubule dynamics, we used video microscopy to determine the in vitro behavior of individual microtubules stabilized by varying amounts of human 4R and 3R tau. At low tau:tubulin ratios (1:55 and 1:45), all 3R isoforms reduced microtubule growth rates relative to the no-tau control, whereas all 4R isoforms increased them; however, at a high tau:tubulin ratio (1:20), both 4R and 3R tau increased the growth rates. Further analysis revealed two distinct subpopulations of growing microtubules in the absence of tau. Increasing concentrations of both 4R and 3R tau resulted in an increase in the size of the faster growing subpopulation of microtubules; however, 4R tau caused a redistribution to the faster growing subpopulation at lower tau:tubulin ratios than 3R tau. This modulation of discrete growth rate subpopulations by tau suggests that tau causes a conformational shift in the microtubule resulting in altered dynamics. Quantitative and qualitative differences observed between 4R and 3R tau are consistent with a “microtubule misregulation” model in which abnormal tau isoform expression results in the inability to properly regulate microtubule dynamics, leading to neuronal death and dementia.

Tau dysfunction has been correlated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, fronto-temporal dementia with parkinsonism associated with chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), Pick disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Each of these diseases is characterized by dead neurons filled with abnormal fibers primarily composed of hyperphosphorylated tau (6.Buee L. Bussiere T. Buee-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R.

A. 1998; 95: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar) reported a direct genetic linkage between mutations in the tau gene and FTDP-17. These mutations all exhibit dominant phenotypes and fall into the following two general classes: structural mutations that alter the encoded sequence of the tau protein, and regulatory mutations that alter the pattern of tau RNA alternative splicing (13.Ingram E.M. Spillantini M.G. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mutations in the latter class do not affect the primary sequence of tau but rather alter the expression ratios of the different wild-type isoforms. Thus, both tau dysfunction and misregulation of isoform expression can cause neuronal cell death and dementia. Although there is only a single tau gene, alternative RNA splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 produces six different tau isoforms in the central nervous system (14.Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar, 15.Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A.

Biol. 1989; 9: 1381-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Each of the tau isoforms possess either three or four imperfect 18 amino acid repeats separated by 13–14 amino acid inter-repeats near the C terminus (Fig. 1A). The inclusion or exclusion of exon 10, encoding the first inter-repeat and the second repeat, determines whether a molecule will be a “4-repeat tau” (4R) or a “3-repeat tau” (3R). Inclusion or exclusion of exons 2 and 3 near the N terminus results in short (S), medium (M), or long (L) tau. Because proper MT behavior is essential for numerous cellular functions (17.Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Fojo T. Microtubules: Importance in Human Diseases and as Therapeutic Targets.

Cell. 2004; 15: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that cells impose extensive regulatory control over tau activity. Indeed, tau activity is finely regulated, both by complex combinatorial patterns of phosphorylation (6.Buee L. Bussiere T. Buee-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) and developmentally regulated alternative RNA splicing. Human fetal brain expresses only the shortest tau isoform (3RS), whereas all six tau isoforms are expressed in the adult brain, with 4R and 3R tau being expressed in an ∼50:50 ratio (10.Hong M.

Bakalis S. Neve R.L. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1389-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The regulatory FTDP-17 mutations cause disease by expressing improper ratios of wild-type tau isoforms, generally resulting in an increase in the expression ratio of 4R:3R tau to ∼75:25 (13.Ingram E.M. Spillantini M.G. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The fact that such alterations in isoform ratio are sufficient to induce neuronal cell death highlights the necessity for fine regulation of tau activity and indicates that 4R and 3R tau are likely to exert functionally distinct effects on MTs. Previous work suggests that 4R and 3R tau differ mechanistically in their interactions with MTs; however, whether the differences are qualitative or only quantitative remains unclear. Four-repeat tau binds to MTs with greater affinity than 3R tau (26.Goode B.L. Chau M. Denis P.E. Feinstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38182-38189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27.Gustke N. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar); 4R tau is also a more potent promoter of MT assembly in vitro (24.Goedert M. Jakes R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 29.Lee G. Neve R.L. Kosik K.S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9548-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 23.Bunker J.M. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Feinstein S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, competition studies of MT binding suggest that 4R and 3R tau may interact with MTs in qualitatively different ways (30.Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Differences between the short, medium, and long isoforms have been much less intensively investigated. Although these N-terminal inserts do not affect MT binding affinity (27.Gustke N. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9511-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), they do appear to regulate MT spacing and bundling (31.Chen J. Kanai Y. Cowan N.J. Hirokawa N. Nature. 1992; 360: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 32.Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Frappier T.F.

Res. 1992; 33: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, their ability to regulate MT assembly and dynamics has not been methodically investigated. Although the genetic linkage between tau mutations and neuronal cell death establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between tau dysfunction/misregulation and neurodegenerative disease, the underlying molecular mechanism leading to neuronal cell death and dementia is not well understood. A widely held, gain-of-toxic-function model suggests that tau mutations lead to the formation and accumulation of abnormal intracellular tau fibers, which in turn cause cell death by virtue of their proposed cytotoxicity (10.Hong M. Zhukareva V. Vogelsberg-Ragaglia V. Wszolek Z. Reed L. Miller B.I. Geschwind D.H. Bird T.D. McKeel D. Goate A. Morris J.C. Wilhelmsen K.C. Schellenberg G.D. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6136-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This model is consistent with the ubiquitous presence of abnormal tau fibers in numerous neurodegenerative diseases (7.Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). However, it has not been established that insoluble tau fibers are in fact cytotoxic. Indeed, numerous animal models have shown that tau-mediated neurodegeneration can occur in the absence of tangles, indicating that they may not necessary for cell death (36.Hall G.F. Chu B. Lee G. Yao J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Wittmann C.W. Wszolek M.F. Shulman J.M. Salvaterra P.M. Lewis J. Hutton M. Feany M.B.

A. 2003; 100: 9980-9985Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). An alternative “microtubule misregulation” model suggests that tau mutations interfere with the normal ability of tau to regulate MT dynamic instability, which in turn leads to cell death. This model is consistent with a variety of pharmacological and somatic cell genetics investigations demonstrating that tight regulation of MT dynamics is essential for proper cell function and viability (17.Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Fojo T. Microtubules: Importance in Human Diseases and as Therapeutic Targets. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2005Google Scholar, 18.Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev.

To assess further the plausibility of the MT misregulation model, we have used differential interference contrast enhanced video microscopy to analyze the dynamic instability behavior of individual MTs stabilized by each of the six human tau isoforms. We show that the N-terminal insertions have no effect on the regulation of MT dynamics. However, we have identified both quantitative and qualitative mechanistic differences between 4R and 3R tau. 4R tau increases the MT growth rate at all concentrations tested, 3R tau decreases the MT growth rate at low tau:tubulin ratios and increases the MT growth rate at high tau:tubulin ratios. Furthermore, we found two subpopulations of growing MTs in both the absence and presence of tau. Both 4R and 3R tau exerted two distinct effects on these subpopulations, which we term “subpopulation shifting” and “subpopulation redistribution,” but did so in different ways. These observations provide strong support for the view that abnormal tau action can cause neuronal cell death and dementia by virtue of aberrant regulation of MT dynamics. Purification of Tau and Tubulin—Expression vectors containing the human cDNA sequences encoding all six tau isoforms expressed in the central nervous system (pET vector containing 3RS tau; pRK vectors containing 3RM, 3RL, 4RS, 4RM, and 4RL) were the kind gifts from Dr. Kenneth Kosik (University of California, Santa Barbara) and Dr. Gloria Lee (Iowa State University). Tau was expressed and purified, as described (23.Bunker J.M. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Feinstein S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, tau was expressed in Rosetta (DE3) pLacI cells (Novagen, Madison, WI). Bacteria were lysed by sonication and boiled for 20 min. Heat-stable proteins were isolated by centrifugation, bound to a phosphocellulose column, and eluted with a salt gradient (0.2 to 1.0 m NaCl). Tau-containing fractions were pooled and further purified using reverse phase-HPLC (DeltaPak-C18; Millipore, Billerica, MA). HPLC fractions containing tau were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in BRB-80 buffer (80 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4) with 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The concentration of each tau sample was determined by SDS-PAGE comparison with a 3RM tau mass standard, the concentration of which was established by amino acid analysis (20.Panda D. Samuel J.C. Massie M. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9548-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The accuracy of our tau concentration determinations is demonstrated by the gel shown in Fig. 1B. Tubulin was purified, as described (41.Toso R.J. Jordan M.A. Farrell K.W. Matsumoto B. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtubule-associated protein-rich bovine brain MT protein was prepared by three cycles of assembly and disassembly. Tubulin was purified from other MT proteins by elution through a Whatman P-11 phosphocellulose column equilibrated in PEM50 (50 mm Pipes, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm GTP). Purified tubulin (>99% pure) was drop-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C. MT Co-sedimentation Assays—Tubulin (15 μm tubulin dimer) was mixed with 3RS or 4RS tau at 0.19 μm (1:80 tau:tubulin), 0.25 μm (1:60), 0.75 μm (1:20), 1.5 μm (1:10), and 7.5 μm (1:2) in PMEM buffer (87 mm Pipes, 36 mm MES, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8) with 2 mm GTP. Microtubules were assembled at 35 °C until steady-state was achieved (2 h), layered over an 80-μl sucrose cushion (50% sucrose in PMEM, 2 mm GTP) in 5 ×20-mm ultraclear centrifuge tubes (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA), and centrifuged in a Beckman AH650 swinging bucket rotor for 12 min at 35,000 rpm (150,000 × g) at 35 °C. Supernatants and pellets were harvested and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Relative amounts of tau in the supernatants and pellets were determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody tau-1 (42.Binder L.I. Frankfurter A. Rebhun L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Dynamic Instability Analyses—Purified tubulin (15 μm tubulin dimer) was polymerized at the ends of sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) axonemal seeds at 37 °C in the presence or absence of a purified tau isoform in PMEM buffer (87 mm Pipes, 36 mm MES, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8) and 2 mm GTP. The dynamics of individual MTs were recorded at 37 °C using differential interference contrast-enhanced video microscopy. The ends were designated as plus or minus on the basis of the growth rate, the number of MTs that grew at opposite ends of the seeds, and the relative lengths of the MTs (21.Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 43.Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Plus ends were analyzed during the early elongation phase of polymerization (2–10 min after initiation of polymerization). Life histories of individual MTs were collected as described by Panda et al. (21.Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with modifications. Data points were collected at 1- to 3-s intervals. Recalibration of tracking software revealed a previous error in scaling factors, resulting in previously reported growth and shortening rates being ∼1.56-fold below true values. Values reported here have been corrected for this error, and thus growth and shortening classifications have been corrected accordingly. A MT was considered to be growing or shortening if it increased or decreased in length at a rate >0.5 μm/min. MTs exhibiting growth rates of ≤0.5 μm/min over a period greater than 30 s were considered to be in an attenuated state. Average growth rates are the average of independent growth events. The catastrophe frequency was calculated by dividing the number of shortening events by the total time tracked. Growth rate histograms were plotted by grouping individual growth events into 0.4 μm/min bins. Best-fit Gaussian distributions were determined using Kaleidagraph software. To control for experimental error, each condition was filmed over multiple days using 2–5 distinct tau/tubulin/GTP mixtures (3–4 slides each). No gross variation in MT dynamics was observed between mixtures or slides of a given condition. Growth rates of the relatively fast and slow growing subpopulations did not grossly correlate with time after polymerization initiation. Growth rates of a given MT were typically different before and after an attenuation or catastrophe event. MTs were tracked by two independent investigators each of whom obtained approximately equal average growth rates for each condition. Before determining the effects of 4R and 3R tau on in vitro MT dynamic instability, we first sought to determine the efficiency with which each isoform incorporates into growing MTs under the conditions of our standard MT dynamics assay. Therefore, we used a co-sedimentation assay to determine the fraction of tau bound to MTs assembled with varying tau: tubulin dimer ratios (1:80 to 1:2). As shown in Fig. 1C, >95% of both 4R and 3R tau was MT-associated at ratios of 1:80, 1:60, and 1:20. At 1:10 and 1:2, an increasing fraction of the tau was not MT-associated, indicating saturation of the MTs. Based on these data, all dynamics studies were performed at tau:tubulin molar ratios between 1:20 and 1:55. Thus, any differences in the abilities of 4R and 3R to regulate MT dynamics can be attributed to inherent mechanistic differences between the bound isoforms. 4R and 3R Tau Have Opposite Effects on the MT Growth Rate at Low Tau:Tubulin Ratios—The in vitro dynamic instability behavior at the plus ends of individual MTs assembled in the presence of 3RS tau or 4RS tau was analyzed during the early elongation phase of MT polymerization. Examples of the dynamic instability of MTs assembled with either no tau, 3RS tau, or 4RS tau at a tau:tubulin ratio of 1:55 are shown in Fig. 2A. Because these studies were performed during the early elongation phase of MT polymerization, we observed mostly growth events with few catastrophes or attenuations. Consistent with previous findings (20.Panda D. Samuel J.C. Massie M. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9548-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 22.Trinczek B. Biernat J. Baumann K. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1887-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), quantitative analysis of many MTs revealed that 4RS tau increased the average MT growth rate significantly (p < 0.01) from 2.8 ± 0.1 μm/min for control MTs to 3.3 ± 0.1 μm/min. Most surprisingly, the same concentration of 3RS tau had the opposite effect, significantly (p < 0.01) decreasing the average growth rate to 2.3 ± 0.1 μm/min (Fig. 2B). To ensure that the unexpected decrease in MT growth rate was not unique to an idiosyncratic aspect of a given tau or tubulin preparation, the above experiments were repeated using independent preparations of all six tau isoforms and a different tubulin preparation. At a 1:55 tau:tubulin ratio, 4RS, 4RM, and 4RL each significantly (p < 0.05) increased the MT growth rate (2.6 ± 0.1, 2.7 ± 0.1, and 2.7 ± 0.1 μm/min, respectively) relative to MTs assembled in the absence of tau (2.3 ± 0.1 μm/min), whereas 3RS, 3RM, and 3RL each significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the growth rate (2.0 ± 0.1, 2.0 ± 0.1, and 1.9 ± 0.1 μm/min, respectively; Table I and Fig. 3). Consistent with earlier work, all six isoforms dramatically decreased the catastrophe frequency (Table I).Table IEffects of all tau isoforms on microtubule growth and shorteningParameterNo tau (15 μm tubulin)3-Repeat tau (0.27 μm)4-Repeat tau (0.27 μm)3RS3RM3RL4RS4RM4RLAverage growth rate (μm/min)2.3 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.1aValues significant at 95% confidence level compared with no tau control.2.0 ± 0.1aValues significant at 95% confidence level compared with no tau control.1.9 ± 0.1aValues significant at 95% confidence level compared with no tau control.2.6 ± 0.1aValues significant at 95% confidence level compared with no tau control.2.7 ± 0.1aValues significant at 95% confidence level compared with no tau control.2.7 ± 0.1aValues significant at 95% confidence level compared with no tau control.Percent of time in phase (no. events) Growing84.2 (36)96.4 (44)86.0 (31)90.4 (37)93.1 (44)87.1 (27)90.9 (28) Shortening0.3 (10)0 (0)0.4 (1)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0.1 (1) Attenuated15.5 (17)3.6 (6)13.6 (12)9.6 (9)6.9 (12)12.9 (9)9.1 (7)Catastrophe frequency (Shortening events/100 min)6.700.80001.2a Values significant at 95% confidence level compared with no tau control. Open table in a new tab Two additional points are worthy of note. First, although the data indicate that low concentrations of 3R tau reduce the MT growth rate, the data in Table I also show that 3R tau increases the percentage of time spent growing and decreases the catastrophe frequency. Therefore, the overall effect of low concentrations of 3R tau may be promotion of net microtubule assembly, albeit growth at a slower rate. Second, the N-terminal inserts may have some subtle effect on time spent in attenuation phase. The short (4RS and 3RS), medium (4RM and 3RM), and long (4RL and 3RL) isoforms spent ∼5, ∼13, and ∼9% of the time in attenuation phase, respectively. However, because attenuation events are relatively rare during early elongation, these apparent differences may be due to normal variation within a small sample size. Both 4R and 3R Tau Increase the Growth Rate at High Tau:Tubulin Ratios—Given that the N-terminal inserts do not appear to dramatically affect MT dynamics (compare values in Table I), we focused our subsequent investigations on a comparison of 4RS and 3RS tau. To characterize further the differences between 4R and 3R tau, we assayed the effect of 4RS and 3RS tau on MT growth rate at four tau:tubulin molar ratios (1:55, 1:45, 1:38, and 1:20). In agreement with previous studies (19.Drechsel D.N. Hyman A.A. Cobb M.H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google"

Cells defective in BRCA2·FANCD1 are extremely sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC) similarly to cells deficient in any of the Fanconi anemia (FA) complementation group proteins (FANC). These observations suggest that the FA pathway and the BRCA2 and Rad51 repair pathway may be linked, although a functional connection between these pathways in DNA damage signaling remains to be determined. Here, we systematically investigated the interaction between these pathways. We show that in response to DNA damage, BRCA2-dependent Rad51 nuclear focus formation was normal in the absence of FANCD2 and that FANCD2 nuclear focus formation and mono-ubiquitination appeared normal in BRCA2-deficient cells. We report that the absence of BRCA2 substantially reduced homologous recombination repair of DNA breaks, whereas the absence of FANCD2 had little effect. Furthermore, we established that depletion of BRCA2 or Rad51 had a greater effect on cell survival in response to MMC than depletion of FANCD2 and that depletion of BRCA2 in FANCD2 mutant cells further sensitized these cells to MMC.

Furthermore, BRCA1 directly interacts with ubiquitinated FANCD2 and FANCA protein (19Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol.

In addition, it was recently reported that FA-D1 cells contain biallelic BRCA2 inactivating mutations and that expression of full-length BRCA2 in FA-D1 cells can partially reverse the MMC sensitivity of these cells (14Howlett N.G.

Supporting the involvement of BRCA2 and its associated protein Rad51 in the classical FA pathway, Digweed et al. (25Digweed M. Rothe S. Demuth I. Scholz R. Schindler D. Stumm M. Grompe M. Jordan A. Sperling K. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have reported that Rad51 focus formation in response to x-rays depends on the integrity of the FA pathway. In addition it has been suggested that mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 promotes IR-induced BRCA2 focus formation (26Wang X. Andreassen P.R. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5850-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, Godthelp et al. (27Godthelp B.C. Artwert F. Joenje H. Zdzienicka M.Z. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5002-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reported normal Rad51 focus formation after MMC or IR treatment in all FA cells other than FA-D1 cells. Thus, the role of BRCA2 in the classical FA pathway in response to DNA damage remains to be resolved. In this study, we further investigated the functional interaction between BRCA2 and FANCD2 following DNA damage. We used BRCA2- and FANCD2-deficient cells and cells treated with siRNAs specifically targeting BRCA2, Rad51, and FANCD2 and demonstrated that FANCD2 does not have a direct role in BRCA2- and Rad51-associated homologous recombination repair following DNA damage.

At least 150 cells in 5–10 different fields were counted for each experiment. Homologous Recombination (HR) Repair Assay—An HR repair assay was carried out as described previously (28Ward I.M. Reina-San-Martin B. Olaru A. Minn K. Tamada K. Lau J.S. Cascalho M. Chen L. Nussenzweig A. Livak F. Nussenzweig M.C. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, the efficiency of HR was assessed using an I-SceI expression plasmid (pCBASce) and an I-SceI repair reporter plasmid (DR-GFP) composed of two differentially mutated GFP genes, one of which contained a unique I-SceI restriction site. The assay works through gene conversion repair of a double strand break caused by I-SceI digestion. DR-GFP plasmids repaired by homologous recombination express GFP (29Moynahan M.E. Pierce A.J. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The relevant cells were transfected with either 2 μg of DR-GFP plus 8 μg of pCBASce or 2 μg of DR-GFP plus 8 μg of control plasmids. 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, and the number of GFP-expressing cells was assessed by flow cytometry. RNA Interference—RNA interference was performed using the Smart Pool siRNA (Dharmacon) for BRCA2, Rad51, and FANCD2. A pSSHUP vector with BRCA2 short hairpin RNA was used for PD20 cells or PD20 + FANCD2 cells. A pSSHUP vector (courtesy of Daniel Billadeau, Mayo Clinic) that produced a short hairpin RNA against BRCA2 was generated with the following oligonucleotides: forward, 5′-gatccccGTTTAGAAAGCCAAGCTACttcaagagaGTAGCTTGGCTTTCTAAACtttttggaaa-3′; reverse, 5′-gggCAAATCTTTCGGTTCGATGaagttctctCATCGAACCGAAAGATTTGaaaaacctttt-3′. Transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides was carried out with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates according to the manufacturer's specifications. Cells were incubated for 48 h posttransfection prior to MMC treatment. MTT Assay—The sensitivity of siRNA-transfected cells to MMC was evaluated using an MTT assay as described previously (30Zhang M. Zhang X. Bai C.X. Chen J. Wei M.Q. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2004; 25: 61-67PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, 5,000 cells were seeded into 96-well plates with 100 μl of culture medium, incubated for 16 h, and exposed to various concentrations of MMC for 72 h. MTT solution (CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent, Promega) (20 μl) was added to each well and incubated for 1.5 h. The absorbance of each well was measured in a micro-plate reader at 490 nm, and the absorbance in treated cells relative to untreated cells was displayed. BRCA2 Is Required for Cell Survival and Rad51 Focus Formation following MMC and Ionizing Radiation—Recent studies indicate that BRCA2-defective cells are extremely sensitive to cross-linking agents (7Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Overkamp W.J. van Lange R.E. Essers J. van Duijn-Goedhart A. Wiggers I. Swaminathan S. van Buul P.P. Errami A. Tan R.T. Jaspers N.G. Sharan S.K. Kanaar R. Zdzienicka M.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To confirm that this hypersensitivity in V-C8 cells deficient in Brca2 is due to the loss of Brca2, we generated V-C8-derivative cell lines stably expressing wild-type human BRCA2 (V-C8 + BRCA2). Expression of human BRCA2 in these V-C8 cells was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). We noted that the exogenously expressed human BRCA2 associated with endogenous Rad51 in these cells (Fig. 1A, middle panel) and that the expression level of Rad51 remained the same as that in V-C8 cells (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). The reconstitution of a BRCA2·Rad51 DNA repair complex in the V-C8 + BRCA2 cells using exogenous human BRCA2 suggested that BRCA2-dependent DNA repair was active in these cells. This was confirmed by demonstrating that the sensitivity of V-C8 cells to double strand breaks and cross-links induced by IR and MMC was largely rescued by the introduction of human BRCA2 into these cells (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, although V-C8 cells showed defective Rad51 focus formation following MMC or IR treatment, we found that BRCA2-reconstituted V-C8 cells displayed a 64.3% increase in the number of cells containing ≥5 foci following MMC treatment and a 78.0% increase after IR treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). Taken together, these data confirm that BRCA2 is required for Rad51 focus formation following DNA damage and suggest that the absence of BRCA2 confers hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents through an inability to recruit Rad51 homologous recombination complexes to sites of DNA damage.Fig. 2FANCD2 functions independently of Rad51 and BRCA2 in response to DNA damage.A, V-C8 reconstituted with BRCA2 form Rad51 foci.

The letters u and l indicate the mono-ubiquitinated (FANCD2-L) and nonubiquitinated (FANCD2-S) forms of FANCD2, respectively. Band intensity of FANCD2 was measured by densitometry. The lower panel shows band intensity of FANCD2-L relative to FANCD2-S.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FANCD2 Is Not Required for Damage-induced Rad51 Focus Formation—Fanconi anemia cells, like V-C8 cells, are extremely sensitive to MMC. To explore the connection between BRCA2 and FANCD2, we examined whether Rad51 damage-induced nuclear focus formation depends on FANCD2. For this study, we used FA-D2 cells (PD20) and an FA-D2-derivative cell line stably expressing human FANCD2 (PD20 + FANCD2). As shown in Fig. 2C, Rad51 localized to nuclear foci following MMC or IR treatment in both PD20 cells and PD20 + FANCD2 cells. The percentage of Rad51-foci positive cells in PD20 cells following MMC treatment or IR treatment was very similar to that in PD20 cells reconstituted with wild-type FANCD2 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, FANCD2 foci were detected only in FA-D2 + FANCD2 cells and not in FA-D2 cells (data not shown). Thus, it appears that FANCD2 is not required for the localization of Rad51 to nuclear DNA damage foci. BRCA2 Is Not Required for FANCD2 Mono-ubiquitination or FANCD2 Focus Formation following DNA Damage—Although FANCD2 is not required for Rad51 localization to nuclear DNA damage foci, it is possible that the BRCA2·Rad51 complex may be involved in the regulation of FANCD2. To investigate whether BRCA2 affects FANCD2 regulation following DNA damage, we evaluated FANCD2 DNA damage focus formation in the absence of functional BRCA2 using BRCA2 mutant FA-D1 cells (VU423/PMMP) cells. Following MMC or IR treatment, the percentage of FA-D1 cells with FANCD2 foci was similar to that in FA-D1 + BRCA2 cells (Fig. 2, E and F). Similarly to V-C8 cells, these FA-D1 cells showed defective Rad51 focus formation after MMC or IR treatment, which could be restored upon expression of exogenous human BRCA2 (data not shown). This suggests that BRCA2 is not required for the formation of FANCD2 foci following DNA damage. Previous studies have shown that FANCD2 is mono-ubiquitinated following DNA damage and that this modified form of FANCD2 can be detected as an upward mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (19Garcia-Higuera I.

Therefore, we further evaluated the influence of BRCA2 on FANCD2 function by examining the effect of the absence of functional BRCA2 on FANCD2 ubiquitination in BRCA2 mutant FA-D1 cells. As shown in Fig. 2G, the mono-ubiquitinated form of FANCD2 was prominent in both FA-D1 cells and FA-D1 cells reconstituted with human BRCA2 (A913 423/2-33; FA-D1 + BRCA2) following MMC or IR treatment. Importantly, the expression levels of FANCD2 in these cells remained the same (data not shown). Taken together these data strongly suggest that BRCA2 is not required for FANCD2 activity in response to DNA damage. FANCD2 Is Not Required for Homologous Recombination Repair of DNA Breaks—To confirm the requirement for BRCA2 in HR repair and to investigate whether FANCD2 is involved in the same HR repair pathway as BRCA2, we used an I-SceI-dependent GFP reporter assay to measure homologous recombination activity in BRCA2- or FANCD2-deficient cells (29Moynahan M.E. Pierce A.J. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). This assay depends on reconstitution of the GFP signal as a consequence of repair of an I-SceI-induced double strand break, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We transfected V-C8, V-C8 + BRCA2, PD20, and PD20 + FANCD2 cells with the DR-GFP reporter plasmid and an I-SceI expression plasmid (pcBASce). 48 h after transfection the proportion of cells expressing GFP following homologous recombination repair of the I-SceI-induced double strand break was measured by flow cytometry. As shown in the example in Fig. 3A, GFP positive cells were rare in both V-C8 + BRCA2 and V-C8 cells transfected with DR-GFP and control vector, whereas the combination of DR-GFP and I-SceI resulted in a substantial increase in GFP positive cells in V-C8 + BRCA2 cells (left panel) but not in V-C8 cells (right panel). When taking the mean of three experiments, we detected an 18.6-fold increase in GFP cells in BRCA2-reconstituted V-C8 cells but only a 3.9-fold increase in GFP cells among V-C8 cells, relative to the controls (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that BRCA2 is required for recombination repair of I-SceI-induced DNA double strand breaks. In FANCD2-deficient PD20 cells, we observed a 13.9-fold increase of GFP positive cells following DNA breaks when compared with controls (Fig. 3C). Moreover, this increase is very similar to the one observed in PD20 cells reconstituted with wild-type FANCD2 (13.7-fold increase), suggesting that FANCD2 does not make a substantial contribution to HR repair, whereas BRCA2 is required for this process. FANCD2 Mediates the Response to MMC Treatment in a BRCA2- and Rad51-independent Manner—To assess whether BRCA2·Rad51 and FANCD2 contribute independently to cell survival in response to MMC, we utilized RNA interference approaches. 293T cells or HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting BRCA2, Rad51, and FANCD2. Each of these siRNAs significantly reduced the expression of targeted proteins (Fig. 4A). In addition, treatment of cells with combinations of these siRNAs resulted in similar reductions in protein levels (data not shown). As expected, depletion of each of these proteins substantially reduced cell survival following MMC treatment. Specifically, depletion of BRCA2 or Rad51 resulted in hypersensitivity to MMC (Fig. 4B). As sensitivity to MMC was not increased when both proteins were depleted in unison, it appears that BRCA2 and Rad51 respond to MMC treatment through the same pathway. In contrast, we noted that depletion of FANCD2 had a small but nonetheless significant effect on cell survival following MMC treatment (Fig. 4C), suggesting that FANCD2 might not influence MMC sensitivity in the same manner as BRCA2 and Rad51. Importantly, when FANCD2 was depleted along with Rad51, we observed enhanced MMC sensitivity compared with cells with either Rad51 or FANCD2 depletion alone (Fig. 4C). This increase in MMC sensitivity following co-depletion of FANCD2 was also observed in the cells depleted of BRCA2 (data not shown). The additive effect of FANCD2 deficiency and either Rad51 or BRCA2 deficiency on MMC sensitivity suggests that FANCD2 functions through a BRCA2- and Rad51-independent repair pathway. However, it is formally possible that combinations of partial defects in the same functional pathway, as might be caused by combined siRNA treatments, could lead to a greater effect than for a single defect. To address this possibility, we evaluated the influence of reduced BRCA2 levels on MMC sensitivity in FANCD2-deficient PD20 cells and in FANCD2-reconstituted PD20 cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, depletion of BRCA2 in both PD20 and PD20-reconstituted cells enhanced MMC sensitivity. Given that the FANCD2 pathway is inactive in these cells, the added MMC sensitivity following BRCA2 depletion provides strong evidence against cooperation of partial defects in the same pathway. Overall, these results suggest that FANCD2 and BRCA2·Rad51 function independently in cell survival following MMC treatment. In this study, we investigated the relationship between BRCA2·Rad51 and FANCD2 in DNA damage-signaling pathway and DNA repair. We have shown that Rad51 focus formation following DNA damage depends on BRCA2 but not FANCD2. In addition, the regulation of FANCD2 following DNA damage is independent of BRCA2, suggesting that FANCD2 may function independently of BRCA2·Rad51. In agreement with this hypothesis, we have shown that FANCD2 is dispensable for a BRCA2·Rad51-dependent homology-directed recombination. Moreover, cells with deficiency in both FANCD2 and BRCA2·Rad51 pathways are more sensitive to MMC, supporting the observation that FANCD2 and BRCA2·Rad51 function in different DNA repair pathways. BRCA2 mutant and deficient cells display extreme sensitivity to DNA damage. In this study, we confirm that the DNA damage hypersensitivity in V-C8 cells (Brca2-deficient) is due to the lack of full-length Brca2. In addition, we show that Rad51 focus formation in response to DNA damage depends on BRCA2 (31Tarsounas M. Davies A.A. West S.C. Philos. Trans R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2004; 359: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), as previously reported for CAPAN-1 cells and Brca2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (32Yu V.P. Koehler M. Steinlein C. Schmid M. Hanakahi L.A. van Gool A.J. West S.C. Venkitaraman A.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1400-1406PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wang J.A. Fan S. Yuan R.Q. Ma Y.X. Meng Q. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that BRCA2 is directly involved in DNA repair by recruiting Rad51 to the sites of DNA damage. Our findings support recent studies showing that BRCA2 and Rad51 are recruited together to sites of double strand DNA breaks (34Davies A.A. Masson J.Y. McIlwraith M.J. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Venkitaraman A.R. West S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 273-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) to facilitate homologous recombination repair (29Moynahan M.E. Pierce A.J. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) as opposed to single strand annealing (35Stark J.M. Pierce A.J. Oh J. Pastink A. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9305-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). BRCA2 and Rad51 mutant and deficient cells display great sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as MMC, a phenomenon similar to that observed in Fanconi anemia cells (10Zdzienicka M.Z. Arwert F. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 458-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As biallelic mutations of BRCA2 have been identified in FA-D1 cells (14Howlett N.G. Taniguchi T. Olson S. Cox B. Waisfisz Q. De Die-Smulders C. Persky N. Grompe M. Joenje H. Pals G. Ikeda H. Fox E.A. D'Andrea A.D. Science. 2002; 297: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), it is now accepted that BRCA2 mutations are responsible for the phenotype observed in FA-D1 cells. These observations led to the hypothesis that the FA pathway is linked with the BRCA2 and Rad51 homologous recombination DNA repair pathway. Data in support of this came from the observations by Digweed et al. (25Digweed M. Rothe S. Demuth I. Scholz R. Schindler D. Stumm M. Grompe M. Jordan A. Sperling K. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that Rad51 foci are attenuated in FA-A, FA-C and FA-G cells after IR exposure. In addition, it appears that FANCG interacts with BRCA2 and co-localizes with BRCA2 after DNA damage (36Hussain S. Witt E. Huber P.A. Medhurst A.L. Ashworth A. Mathew C.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that FANCD2 interacts with BRCA2 (37Hussain S. Wilson J.B. Medhurst A.L. Hejna J. Witt E. Ananth S. Davies A. Masson J.Y. Moses R. West S.C. de Winter J.P. Ashworth A. Jones N.J. Mathew C.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and is required for BRCA2 focus formation (26Wang X. Andreassen P.R. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5850-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In addition, mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 is needed for the assembly of IR-induced FANCD2 and BRCA2 foci (26Wang X. Andreassen P.R. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5850-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, Godthelp et al. (27Godthelp B.C. Artwert F. Joenje H. Zdzienicka M.Z. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5002-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reported that normal Rad51 focus formation is observed in all FA cells except FA-D1 cells in response to DNA damage induced by MMC or X-rays, suggesting that the BRCA2-associated Rad51 homologous recombination repair pathway and the FA repair pathway may function independently in the response to these types of DNA damage. In this study, we attempted to clarify these apparently inconsistent findings by systematically examining the contribution of FANCD2 to the BRCA2- and Rad51-dependent DNA damage response. Our data show the normal appearance of nuclear Rad51 foci in FANCD2-deficient PD20 cells. We did not detect any quantitative difference in Rad51 focus formation in FANCD2-deficient or proficient cells following MMC or IR treatment. We also noted that Rad51 focus formation appeared normal in FA-F cells following MMC or IR treatment (data not shown), whereas Rad51 foci failed to form in BRCA2-deficient cells. Our results are in keeping with those of Godthelp et al. (27Godthelp B.C. Artwert F. Joenje H. Zdzienicka M.Z. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5002-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and strongly suggest that FANCD2 is not required for Rad51 focus formation following DNA damage. The results also appear to suggest that FANCD2 functions independently of BRCA2 and Rad51 in DNA repair. To further address this possibility, we evaluated the influence of BRCA2 deficiency on FANCD2 function. We found that FANCD2 foci formed normally in BRCA2-deficient cells following exposure to DNA damaging agents. We also failed to detect any difference in damage-induced mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 in BRCA2-defective or reconstituted cells, suggesting that BRCA2 is not involved in FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination after DNA damage. In support of our studies, Bruun et al. (38Bruun D. Folias A. Akkari Y. Cox Y. Olson S. Moses R. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have recently shown that BRCA2 depletion does not affect FANCD2 ubiquitination after DNA damage. Taken together, these findings establish that BRCA2 is not upstream of FANCD2 in the DNA damage-signaling pathway. We next assessed the role of FANCD2 in homologous recombination repair of DNA breaks. It has been clearly established using a homology-directed repair reporter assay (29Moynahan M.E. Pierce A.J. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) that BRCA2 and Rad51 are required for HR repair of DNA double strand breaks. We used the same assay to confirm the requirement for BRCA2 in HR repair in V-C8 cells and to demonstrate that FANCD2 does not have a significant involvement in this BRCA2- and Rad51-dependent HR repair using FANCD2-deficient PD20 cells. Similarly, Nakanishi et al. (39Nakanishi K. Yang Y. Pierce A.J. Taniguichi T. Digweed M. D'Andrea A.D. Wang Z. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) have reported that a deficiency in FANCD2 has a very mild effect on HR repair as measured by this assay (39Nakanishi K. Yang Y. Pierce A.J. Taniguichi T. Digweed M. D'Andrea A.D. Wang Z. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In addition, we used RNA interference to show that depletion of FANCD2 resulted in mild MMC sensitivity compared with the effects of BRCA2 or Rad51 depletion. Moreover, we observed that FANCD2 depletion or inactivation in combination with depletion of BRCA2 or Rad51 enhanced Rad51- and BRCA2-dependent MMC sensitivity, whereas double depletion of BRCA2 and Rad51 did not enhance MMC sensitivity. On the basis of these data we propose a model in which FANCD2 mediates repair of IR-induced and other DNA damage through a pathway that is independent of the Rad51 homologous recombination repair pathway. Similarly, Nakanishi et al. (39Nakanishi K. Yang Y. Pierce A.J. Taniguichi T. Digweed M. D'Andrea A.D. Wang Z. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) have proposed a role for FANCD2 in a second BRCA2-independent double strand break pathway involving homology. Likewise, based on the recent finding that FANCD2-disrupted chicken DT40 cells exhibit normal Rad51 repair foci and do not display decreased spontaneous sister chromatid exchange, Yamamoto et al. (40Yamamoto K. Hirano S. Ishiai M. Morishima K. Kitao H. Namikoshi K. Kimura M. Matsushita N. Arakawa H. Buerstedde J.M. Komatsu K. Thompson L.H. Takata M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have proposed that FANCD2 functions in a sub-DNA repair pathway that is independent of DNA crossover and sister chromatid exchange. Importantly these FANCD2-defective chicken cells were deficient in HR-mediated DNA repair. In contrast, studies in human cells have shown that deficiency in FANCD2 does not have a substantial effect on HR repair in human cells (39Nakanishi K. Yang Y. Pierce A.J. Taniguichi T. Digweed M. D'Andrea A.D. Wang Z. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The difference in these observations may be explained by the use of different HR assays to detect homology-directed repair. Certainly, a number of different recombination assays exist that appear to measure different HR and double stand break repair processes, some of which are yet to be fully understood. Alternatively, the contrasting results may derive from differences in double strand break repair between chicken DT40 cells and human cells. Nevertheless, it is clear that FANCD2 functions in a DNA repair pathway that is different from that of BRCA2 and Rad51. Future studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the FA- or FANCD2-dependent DNA repair pathway. We thank Alan D. D'Andrea and Toshiyasu Taniguchi for valuable reagents and members of the Chen and Couchlaboratories for helpful discussions.

The E-selectin gene is rapidly and transiently expressed by endothelial cells activated by inflammatory stimuli. Despite the identification of factors critical for cytokine-induced activation of the E-selectin promoter, little is known about the mechanisms that restrict the gene expression to endothelial cells. We used in vivo approaches to characterize the E-selectin promoter in primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and umbilical artery smooth muscle cells. In endothelial cells specifically, nucleosomes are remodeled after tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α induction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the binding of the p65 (RelA) component of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to the endogenous E-selectin promoter after TNFα stimulation along with IκB kinase α. Multiple coactivators, including p300, steroid receptor coactivator-1, and p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP)-associated factor localize differentially to the E-selectin promoter. Additionally, TNFα induced localized histone hyperacetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation in the E-selectin gene specifically in endothelial cells.

Blood. 1996; 88: 3259-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Pober J.S. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). E-selectin gene expression is rapidly up-regulated upon exposure to inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HDAC, histone deacetylase; CHART PCR, chromatin accessibility real-time PCR; ChIP; chromatin immunoprecipitation; CRR, cytokine response region; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; p/CAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; IKK, IκB kinase; TBP, TATA-binding protein; RT, reverse transcription; SCR-1, steroid receptor coactivator; UASMC, umbilical artery smooth muscle cell.1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HDAC, histone deacetylase; CHART PCR, chromatin accessibility real-time PCR; ChIP; chromatin immunoprecipitation; CRR, cytokine response region; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; p/CAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; IKK, IκB kinase; TBP, TATA-binding protein; RT, reverse transcription; SCR-1, steroid receptor coactivator; UASMC, umbilical artery smooth muscle cell.

The increase in mRNA after the induction is due to an increase in the rate of gene transcription, which is maintained for several hours in the continuous presence of cytokine (4Read M.A. Neish A.S. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3472-3479PubMed Google Scholar, 5Whelan J. Ghersa P. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gray J. Chandra G. Talabot F. DeLamarter J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2645-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). After removal of TNFα, there is a rapid post-induction transcriptional repression, with gene expression falling to basal levels within 24 h. Studies of the regulation of E-selectin gene expression have identified promoter elements that regulate inflammatory cytokine inducibility. Sequences within the first 160 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site, the cytokine response region (CRR), are necessary for efficient cytokine-inducible expression of the human E-selectin promoter in transient transfection assays. This promoter region contains binding sites for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activating transcription factor-2/c-JUN transcription factors as well as the architectural factor, high mobility group I(Y) (HMG-I(Y)) (6Kaszubska W. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Ghersa P. DeRaemy-Schenk A.M. Chen B.P. Hai T. DeLamarter J.F. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7180-7190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lewis H. Kaszubska W.

Mutations within any of these sites severely reduces or eliminates inducible expression from the E-selectin promoter. The ability of the transcriptional activators to stimulate E-selectin gene expression depends upon their specific spatial arrangement (10Meacock S. Pescini-Gobert R. DeLamarter J.F. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31756-31762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and their ability to recruit a series of coactivators (11Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.K. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Merika M. Williams A.J. Chen G. Collins T. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). NF-κB inhibition, mRNA degradation, and post-induction repression all play a role in the down-regulation of E-selectin gene expression (4Read M.A. Neish A.S. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3472-3479PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kluger M.S. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 887-896PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chu W. Presky D.H. Swerlick R.A. Burns D.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4179-4189PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the identification of factors critical for cytokine-induced activation of the E-selectin promoter, little is known about the mechanisms that restrict the gene expression to endothelial cells. In fact, the activators that regulate the cytokine response region in the E-selectin promoter are broadly expressed, and the proximal promoter of the E-selectin gene is inducible in both endothelial and non-endothelial cells when it is used in promoter-reporter constructs and transient transfection assays. Mechanisms must exist that allow NF-κB to activate only specific genes in a given cell type. Because the higher order structure of chromatin represents an obstacle to the binding of transcription factors and the formation of preinitiation complexes (for review, see Ref. 15Adelman K. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 451-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that chromatin remodeling might be key in controlling the selective induction of many NF-κB-dependent inflammatory genes, including E-selectin (16Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Parekh B. Yie J. Maniatis T. Thanos D. Cell. 2000; 103: 667-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 17Lomvardas S. Thanos D.

Immunity. 1999; 11: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A second potential mechanism for controlling chromatin structure is selective histone modification. The histone octamers around which genomic DNA is packed can be extensively modified at their N-terminal tails and can serve as signals to regulatory complexes that can either induce or repress expression of the marked region (for review, see Ref. 20Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In this way the histone modifications serve as an epigenetic code that indicates a subset of available genes that can be expressed in a given cell in response to a signal (21Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7468) Google Scholar). Previous studies of NF-κB-dependent gene expression suggest that histone modifications may play a role in the regulation of specific target genes (22Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 23Saccani S. Natoli G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 24Agalioti T. Chen G. Thanos D. Cell. 2002; 111: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Here we use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and nucleosome analysis to demonstrate that the induction of authentic E-selectin gene expression is associated with localized hyperacetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation of histones as well as nucleosome remodeling at the promoter. Neither the localized histone modifications nor the changes in nucleosome positioning take place at the E-selectin locus in vascular smooth muscle cells, suggesting that these chromatin changes are an important part of the endothelial-specific expression of the E-selectin gene. Cell Culture and Antibodies—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from fresh human umbilical cords and cultured as described (25Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1976; 3: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). HUVECs were maintained in Medium 199 (Cambrex Corp.) containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml endothelial growth supplement (Biomedical Technologies, Inc.). Human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells were obtained from Cambrex and maintained according to the supplier's instructions. Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: anti-p65 (sc-109), anti-p/CAF (sc-8999), HDAC1 (sc-7872), anti-HDAC2 (sc-7899), anti-HDAC3 (sc-11417), anti-HDAC4 (sc-11418), anti-Sin3A (sc-767), anti-IKKα (sc-7218), anti-IKKβ (sc-7330), c-Rel (sc-272), anti-p52 (sc-298), anti-RNA polymerase II (sc-899), anti-TBP (sc-273), and anti-SRC-1 (sc-6096) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-p300 (BD Biosciences); anti-diacetyl-H3, anti-phospho-H3-S10, anti-dimethyl-H3-K9, anti-acetyl-H3-K9, and anti-tetra-acetyl-H4 (Upstate Biotechnology); anti-dimethyl-H3-K4 and anti-trimethyl-H3-K4 (Abcam); anti-acetyl-H4-K5, anti-acetyl-H4-K8, anti-acetyl-H4-K12, and anti-acetyl-H4-K16 (Serotec); anti-CBP (a generous gift of D. M. Livingston, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute); anti-Brg-1 (a generous gift of W. Wang, NIA, National Institutes of Health). Quantitative, Reverse Transcriptase Real-time PCR—Primary cultures of HUVECs at passage 3 were grown to confluence in 10-cm dishes and then treated with 10 ng/ml recombinant, human TNFα (Peprotech) for the indicated time points. Total RNA was harvested using the Absolutely RNA RT-PCR miniprep kit (Stratagene), and the quality was verified on a agarose gel. 500 ng of total RNA was used with the Brilliant SYBR green quantitative RT-PCR master mix (Stratagene). PCR reactions were performed in triplicate with primers to β-actin and E-selectin cDNA (see the sequences in Table I) in separate wells and monitored using a Mx3000P real-time PCR machine (Stratagene). Results are presented as the amount of E-selectin mRNA present relative to the untreated cells and normalized to the level of β-actin mRNA. Specificity of the PCR reaction was verified with dissociation curve analysis, no-template controls, and no-RT controls.Table ISequences of the primers used for quantitative RT-PCR, ChIP analysis, and CHART PCRPrimersSequenceQuantitative RT-PCRE-selectin5′-TGAAGCTCCCACTGAGTCCAA-3′5′-GGTGCTAATGTCAGGAGGGAGA-3′β-actin5′-GCCGATCCACACGGAGTACT-3′5′-CATGGAATTCGAACCCAAACA-3′ChIP quantitative PCR5′5′-AGAGCTGTGATGGTCAAGGATGT-3′5′-CGAGATTCCTTGTTCTACCCAAGT-3′Primer set A5′-GGGAAAGTTTTTGGATGCCATT-3′5′-TGTCCACATCCAGTAAAGAGGAAAT-3′Promoter/primer set B5′-ACCCACCTGAGAGATCCTGTGT-3′5′-GGCTGCCCTTATAAAGCGTTCT-3′CDS5′-TGTGAACGAGCTTGGCAAGT-3′5′-GCTCCAAGCCACCTTTGAAG-3′3′5′-TGGCAGGCAGAGGAATGG-3′5′-CCATTTTCCACACCGCTATGA-3′CHART PCRP15′-GAGACACTACTAACAAGCAAAGTTTTACAA-3′5′-TGCCTTTATATCGTATATGCAATTTTATTAA-3′P25′-TGACATCATTGTAATTTTAAGCATCGT-3′5′-CCAATGGCATCCAAAAACTTTC-3′P35′-ACCCACCTGAGAGATCCTGTGT-3′5′-GCTTGTACAGATGTGGTTTTTATTAGAAG-3′P45′-ATGCTGCCTTAAACATCATGGTAGA-3′5′-GGAGATAAAACACAAAATGAATTAAAGAAG-3′β-Actin5′-CAGCTCACCATGGATGATGATATC-3′5′-TGCCGGAGCCGTTGTC-3′ Open table in a new tab Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described (26Edelstein L.C.

Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Chromatin was harvested from 5 150-mm plates (∼2.7 × 107) of passage 4 HUVECs or 10 150-mm plates of vascular smooth muscle cells. Cells were treated for the indicated times with 10 ng/ml TNFα. The cells were then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Isolated nuclei were subjected to 15 20-s sonication pulses from a Branson Sonifer 250 at the maximum microtip output level. Uniformity of the sonication treatment was confirmed by reversing the cross-linking and running recovered DNA on an agarose gel (data not shown). The chromatin preparation was then divided into 20-μl aliquots, To confirm uniformity, aliquots were subjected to reverse cross-linking and DNA recovery. The quantity of DNA was then compared using real-time PCR. The difference in quantity between aliquots did not exceed 5% (data not shown). Additionally, aliquots from different chromatin preparations were also compared using real-time PCR. The difference in chromatin quantity between chromatin preparations did not differ more than 10% (data not shown). For each ChIP one aliquot of chromatin was incubated with the indicated antibody overnight at 4 °C. Additionally, an aliquot from the same chromatin preparation was used for a no-antibody negative control. Preblocked protein-A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) were added to the binding reaction for 3 h at 4 °C. Real-time PCR reactions were performed in triplicate with 2 μl of precipitated DNA with and the Brilliant SYBR green quantitative PCR kit (Stratagene). DNA recovered from samples containing an antibody was compared with no-antibody negative controls performed on aliquots from the same chromatin preparation. Additionally, uniformity of the chromatin preparations was confirmed by analyzing the background level of an unrelated genomic locus by real-time PCR. Data are then presented as the amount of DNA recovered relative to the appropriate negative control. In this way, differences between chromatin preparations are normalized. Conclusions are only made about the presence or absence of a particular protein on a stretch of DNA over time. Because each antibody has a different efficiency at binding to its target, no conclusions can be drawn about the relative abundance of proteins on a particular segment of the genome. CHART-PCR—Nucleosome mapping was performed using chromatin accessibility real-time PCR assays (28Rao S. Procko E. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4494-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). 5 150-mm passage 4 HU-VECs were untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 30, 60, or 120 min. The cells were then harvested and washed in PBS and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 μm spermine, and 500 μm spermidine. The isolated nuclei were then washed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 150 μm spermine, and 500 μm spermidine; then they were resuspended in 700 μl of the same buffer but with the addition of 1 mm CaCl2. 100 μl of nuclei were digested with the indicated amount of micrococcal nuclease (Upstate Cell Signalling Solutions) for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% SDS, and 75 μg of proteinase K. Genomic DNA was then extracted using the QIAmp kit (Qiagen). 50 μg of DNA from micrococcal nuclease-digested or non-digested control cells was used in real-time PCR with the primer sets listed in Table I. Percent protection was calculated as the amount of DNA recovered from the digested cells relative to the control cells. TNFα Induces Rapid Expression of the E-selectin Gene—To investigate the sequence of events occurring at the human E-selectin promoter upon induction of the gene by TNFα, we utilized primary cultures of HUVEC cells, which are known to be responsive to inflammatory cytokines. Our group and many others previously demonstrated that upon exposure to TNFα, these cells rapidly express the E-selectin adhesion molecule. To quantitate the induction of E-selectin mRNA in endothelial cells, real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed. HUVEC cells were exposed to recombinant human TNFα for 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 min and 12 h. Total RNA was collected and used to evaluate the level of E-selectin mRNA relative to the expression level of β-actin (Fig. 1A). Induction of E-selectin gene expression was seen 30–60 min after the addition of TNFα. E-selectin mRNA levels peaked at 11-fold, relative to the untreated cells, at 2 h and then declined. After 12 h of continuous exposure to TNFα, levels of E-selectin mRNA had dropped back down to 4-fold over the levels of resting cells. These data are consistent with other reports of the regulation of E-selectin gene expression (3Bevilacqua M.P. Stengelin S. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Seed B. Science. 1989; 243: 1160-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar, 4Read M.A. Neish A.S. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3472-3479PubMed Google Scholar, 5Whelan J. Ghersa P. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gray J. Chandra G. Talabot F. DeLamarter J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2645-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To correlate the induction of E-selectin gene expression with the binding of RNA polymerase II, we used ChIP assays to evaluate the presence of proteins on the chromatin in vivo. Two primer sets were used for real-time PCR to evaluate the results of the ChIP. Primer set A correlates with the cytokine regulatory region (referred to as CRR throughout the remainder of the paper) at –156/–66, whereas Primer set B corresponds to an area immediately downstream of the transcription start site at +65/+139 (referred to as the downstream region) (Fig. 1B). Although the distance between the two primer sets (131 bp) is smaller than the average chromatin fragments produced during sonication (∼1000 bp), the real-time PCR method allowed us to look at the two regions and make logical conclusions about the location of factor binding based on the relative enrichment of each amplified region. The data are presented as the -fold enrichment of target DNA in the antibody containing sample versus that in the negative no-antibody control using the comparative CT method (ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, User Bulletin 2). The results from the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and RNA polymerase II ChIP show that TBP is maximally detected at the downstream area (primer set B) after 30 min of TNFα treatment and less so by 60 min (Fig. 1C). Likewise, RNA polymerase is observed at the downstream area (primer set B) maximally at 1 h and is then equivalent to basal levels by 12 h (Fig. 1D). This corresponds with the expression data (Fig. 1A). No appreciable polymerase binding is detectable at the CRR at any point. NF-κB Factors Play a Role in E-selectin Expression Both Early and Late after Induction—The NF-κB dimer is believed to be a critical regulator of E-selectin expression (5Whelan J. Ghersa P. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gray J. Chandra G. Talabot F. DeLamarter J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2645-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 7Lewis H. Kaszubska W. DeLamarter J.F. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Whitley M.Z. Thanos D.

Med. 1994; 179: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To date, however, there has been no direct demonstration that NF-κB interacts in vivo with the promoter of the authentic E-selectin gene. Using the ChIP technique, we observed that the p65 component of the canonical NF-κB p50/p65 dimer bound mainly to the CRR with peak detection occurring 30 min after TNFα treatment (Fig. 2A). Detection of p65 peaked before maximal E-selectin mRNA accumulation (120 min, Fig. 1) and appeared to be transient, with enrichment levels falling at 60 min. Interestingly, although p50 occurred at the CRR at 30 min, the peak of detection occurred on the downstream region 1 h after treatment (Fig. 2B). Enrichment of p50 is also detected on the CRR 12 h after treatment (Fig. 2B). p50 appears to be present on the E-selectin promoter as p65 levels are diminished or absent. Attempts to identify proteins that are known to interact with p50 such as Bcl-3 were negative (data not shown). Additionally, studies using ChIP for c-Rel and p52 were also negative (data not shown). Multiple Coactivators Localize Differentially to the E-selectin Promoter—Multiple coactivators have been implicated in NF-κB-dependent gene expression (11Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.K. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used ChIP analysis to determine whether histone acetyltransferase-containing coactivators associate with the authentic E-selectin promoter during TNFα-induced expression. p300 and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), closely related histone acetyltransferases with bromodomains for binding to acetylated histone tails, show different patterns of recruitment to the E-selectin promoter. p300 is observed at the downstream region of the E-selectin promoter in HUVECs 30 min after treatment with TNFα (Fig. 3A). In contrast, CBP is minimally detected, and its levels don't change with induction of E-selectin (Fig. 3B). Like p300, the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), a member of the p160 family of coactivators, is also detected at the downstream region 30 min after TNFα treatment (Fig. 3C). p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF) exhibits a different recruitment pattern from that of p300 or SRC-1. Undetectable on the downstream region at any point, there is a dramatic peak of enrichment of the CRR after ChIP for p/CAF 60 min after TNFα treatment (Fig. 3D). The differences in both time and location of the coactivators recruited to the promoter suggest that at least two distinct coactivator complexes, one containing p300 and another containing p/CAF, participate in the regulation of the E-selectin gene. The Histones on the E-selectin Gene Are Locally Acetylated on Specific Residues—The H3 and H4 subunits of the nucleosome octamer are capable of undergoing extensive modifications including acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation (for review, see Ref. 20Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The modifications occur in a locus-specific manner in a way that can determine whether an area of the genome is actively transcribed (euchromatic) or silent (heterochromatic). To determine what modifications were taking place on the E-selectin promoter in HUVECs after TNFα treatment, we used various antibodies specific for modified histone tails in ChIP assays and multiple primer sets covering the extreme 5′ region (–2851/–2772), promoter (+65/+139), coding sequence (+7040/+7109), and extreme 3′ region of the E-selectin gene (+13914/+13977) (Fig. 4A). Acetylation has long been known to associate with actively transcribed genes (31Marushige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3937-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Caldarera C.M. Casti A. Guarnieri C. Moruzzi G. Recent Adv. Stud. Card. Struct. Metab. 1975; 7: 91-97PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for diacetylated H3 (K9 and K14) and tetraacetylated H4 (K5, K8, K12, and K16) reveal a pattern of transient, localized acetylation at the promoter and 5′ regions of the E-selectin gene (Figs. 4B and 5A). Both detect a strong increase in histone acetylation at the 0.5-h time point with maximum detection of the 5′ region at the 1-h mark. In both instances acetylation is more pronounced in the 5′ and promoter regions of the E-selectin gene, indicating a localized effect. It is important to note that the diacetyl-H3 (Fig. 4B) and tetraacetyl-H4 antibodies (Fig. 5A), which preferentially recognize the fully modified tails, do not precipitate E-selectin chromatin at 12 h post-induction. Detailed analysis with antibodies that recognize individual acetylation sites on histones H3 and H4 disclose more complex patterns. Acetylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3-K9) is observed primarily in the coding sequence and the promoter at 0.5 h and again at 12 h over a broader range of the E-selectin gene (Fig. 4C). Analysis of individual lysines on histone H4 suggests that these residues appear to have different patterns of acetylation and deacetylation. Both lysines 5 and 8 are acetylated at the 60-min time point, and lysine 8 retains acetylation after 12 h, whereas lysine 5 becomes deacetylated (Figs. 5, B and C). It is interesting to note that the acetylation of H4-K8 histones appears to spread downstream, from being predominantly on the 5′ end of the gene to being highly enriched throughout the gene (Fig. 5C). H4-K12 appears to be maximally acetylated within 30 min at the promoter, 5′, and coding regions and decrease afterward (Fig. 5D). ChIP analysis of lysine 16 (H4-K16) gave high background levels, and the relative change in this modification appears to be minimal (data not shown). Histones on the E-selectin Promoter Are Transiently and Locally Phosphorylated—Histone phosphorylation has been shown to mark the promoter of some stimulus-induced inflammatory genes (22Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). E-selectin possesses this trait, showing H3-S10 phosphorylation in the promoter and coding regions of the gene (Fig. 6A). This phosphorylation is transient, peaking at 30 min post-induction and no longer detectable at 60 min. Primers for the 5′ and 3′ regions of the E-selectin gene failed to show phosphorylation at any time point, indicating that histone H3-S10 phosphorylation is a localized modification of the E-selectin gene. Recent evidence points to a role for the IκB kinase α (IKKα) in the modification of chromatin in NF-κB-regulated genes (33Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 34Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). ChIP analysis using an antibody against IKKα revealed dramatic recruitment to the promoter. The kinase was specifically associated with the CRR region of the E-selectin promoter at the 30-min time point and released by 1 h (Fig. 6B) in a kinetic pattern similar to that of p65 (Fig. 2A). To serve as a control, we also used an antibody against IKKβ, another kinase in the NF-κB pathway (for review, see Ref. 35Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar) and were unable to detect significant levels at any point (Fig. 6C). This suggests that there is some specificity in the recruitment of kinases to the E-selectin promoter. Histone Methylation Leaves a Lasting Mark on the E-selectin Gene—Histone methylation is also an important regulator of transcriptional expression, signaling activation, repression, and silencing of a particular locus (fo"

The chaperone activity of Hsp90 requires ATP, which binds with ∼10-fold lower affinity than ADP. This suggests that Hsp90 may be a physiological ATP sensor, regulating the stability of growth signaling cascades in relation to cellular energy charge. Here we show that lowering ATP concentration by inhibiting glycolysis or mitochondrial respiration in isolated myocytes triggers rapid dissociation of Hsp90 from ErbB2 and degradation of ErbB2 along with other client proteins. The effect of disrupting Hsp90 chaperone activity by ATP depletion was similar to the effect of the pharmacological Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. ATP depletion-induced disruption of Hsp90 chaperone activity was associated with cellular resistance to growth factor activation of intracellular signaling. ErbB2 degradation was also induced by the physiological stress of β-adrenergic receptor stimulation in electrically stimulated cells. These results support a role for Hsp90 as an ATP sensor that modulates tissue growth factor responsiveness under metabolically stressed conditions and provide a novel mechanism by which cellular responsiveness to growth factor stimulation is modulated by cellular energy charge.

The physiological mechanisms by which cells dynamically shift between steady states of tissue function, for example from tissue growth to cell survival during periods of metabolic stress, are incompletely understood. The activity of large sets of proteins must be coordinately regulated during these shifts. Many of the proteins involved in cell growth are stabilized by the constitutively expressed chaperone heat shock protein (Hsp) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ARVM, adult rat ventricular myocyte; β-AR, β-adrenergic receptor; CHIP, carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GA, geldanamycin; HSF, heat shock factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NE, norepinephrine; NRG, neuregulin.1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ARVM, adult rat ventricular myocyte; β-AR, β-adrenergic receptor; CHIP, carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GA, geldanamycin; HSF, heat shock factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NE, norepinephrine; NRG, neuregulin. 90 (1.Blagosklonny M.V.

Dissociation of Hsp90 from its client proteins induced by Hsp90 inhibitors leads to rapid degradation of proteins involved in cell growth and the activation of a stress response (3.Nishiyama N. Nori A. Malugin A. Kasuya Y. Kopeckova P. Kopecek J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7876-7882PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, pharmacologically induced disruption in Hsp90 chaperone function alone can cause a cell to “shift gears” to a stress-mode.Hsp90 inhibitors such as geldanamycin (GA) bind with high affinity to a conserved pocket in the Hsp90 family of proteins and thereby prevent the ATP binding that is required for chaperone function (4.Chiosis G. Timaul M.N. Lucas B. Munster P.N. Zheng F.F. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Rosen N. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 289-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The relative affinity of Hsp90 for GA, ADP, and ATP were recently measured and exhibited dissociation constants of 0.2, 12, and 124 μm, respectively (5.Carreras C.W. Schirmer A. Zhong Z. Santi D.V. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 317: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The relatively high affinity of Hsp90 for GA is consistent with its established potency as an inhibitor of Hsp90 chaperone function. The ∼10-fold higher affinity of Hsp90 for ADP versus ATP is intriguing. Under basal conditions, when the intracellular [ATP]/[ADP] ratio is between 2 and 10:1 (6.Wiggers H. Noreng M. Paulsen P.K. Bottcher M. Egeblad H. Nielsen T.T. Botker H.E. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2001; 37: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the higher affinity of Hsp90 for ADP suggests that a small drop in the ATP/ADP ratio will result in a relatively large drop in the proportion of Hsp90 occupied by ATP and, therefore, available for client protein stabilization.These observations led us to hypothesize that Hsp90 functions as a physiologic ATP sensor, regulating the stability of growth and stress signaling proteins in response to a reduction in cellular energy charge. We tested this hypothesis by examining the role of Hsp90 in the stabilization of ErbB2 in cardiac myocytes. We have previously demonstrated that ErbB2 activation by neuregulin regulates growth and stress signaling in cardiac myocytes (7.Sawyer D.B. Zuppinger C. Miller T.A. Eppenberger H.M. Suter T.M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1551-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and ErbB2 is a well known Hsp90 client protein (8.Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 9.Zhou P. Fernandes N. Dodge I.L. Reddi A.L. Rao N. Safran H. DiPetrillo T.A. Wazer D.E. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13829-13837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the high basal energy requirements of contracting ventricular myocytes might make them more likely to reveal such an ATP-sensing activity of Hsp90. We show that Hsp90 inhibitors induce the rapid dissociation of Hsp90 from ErbB2 and the degradation of ErbB2 via a proteasome pathway that involves Hsp70 and the carboxyl terminus Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP). We demonstrate that ATP depletion has a similar effect on Hsp90/ErbB2 association and ErbB2 stability, along with other Hsp90 client proteins, and resistance to growth factor-stimulated kinase signaling. The potential role of Hsp90 as an ATP sensor that modulates tissue growth factor responsiveness under stressed conditions is discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and Antibodies—GA and MG132 were purchased from EMD Biosciences Inc.

Mouse anti-actin was from Sigma.Preparation of Cardiac Myocytes—Adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150–200 g as described previously (7.Sawyer D.B. Zuppinger C. Miller T.A. Eppenberger H.M. Suter T.M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1551-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). For most experiments, ARVMs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm Hepes, and 100 units/ml 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 100 μm bromodeoxyuridine culture medium. ARVMs were treated on day 7 in culture at a time when cells are spontaneously beating (10.Lim C.C. Zuppinger C. Guo X. Kuster G.M. Helmes M. Eppenberger H.M. Suter T.M. Liao R. Sawyer D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8290-8299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For experiments involving electrical stimulation, ARVMs were maintained in serum-free media for 16 h prior to electrical stimulation at 5 Hz using a 2-ms pulse duration and 6.6 V/cm stimuli with alternating polarity using a cell culture pacing system (Ionoptix) as described (11.Kuramochi Y. Lim C.C. Guo X. Colucci W.S. Liao R. Sawyer D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 286: C222-C229Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These conditions result in >70% capture of myocytes.Lysate Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) and lysed by scraping in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (4 °C) for 15 min. For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of lysate protein was incubated with 2 μg of mouse monoclonal antibodies at 4 °C overnight, followed by the addition of protein G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0005% bromphenol blue), and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins (or cell lysates mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer) were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE. Protein was detected with an antibody using a chemiluminescence-based Western blotting kit (DuPont) according to the supplier's instructions. Membranes were exposed for various times to Kodak X-Omat AR film. Films were scanned and analyzed by densitometry to obtain semi-quantitative analysis of protein expression.Metabolic Labeling of Cultured Cells—Cells-were washed and incubated for 12 h in medium free of methionine, followed by the addition of 5 Ci/ml 35S-labeled methionine for an overnight incubation (pulse). Cells were then washed thoroughly, incubated in media containing methionine, and given GA treatment for different times (chase). This was followed by cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis, and autoradiography of dry gels.Luminescence ATP Detection Assay—1.0 ×104 ARVMs per well in a 96-well microplate were washed and incubated for 12 h in fetal calf serum-free medium after culture for 7 days. Cells were treated by 2-deoxy-d-glucose and antimycin-A as indicated. Cellular ATP was measured using ATPLite™ (12.Kangas L. Gronroos M. Nieminen A.L. Med. Biol. 1984; 62: 338-343PubMed Google Scholar), an ATP monitoring system based on firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase according to the manufacturer's instructions. A LumiCount microplate reader was used to measure the luminescence.Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as mean ± S.D. from at least four experiments in each group at each time point (except any-where mentioned in the text). Comparisons were made by unpaired t test or by one-way analysis of variance as appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSHsp90 Inhibition Induces ErbB2 Degradation via a Proteasome Pathway with Disruption of Hsp90/ErbB2—We first examined the chaperone function of Hsp90 in cardiac myocytes using the Hsp90 inhibitor GA. As in the other cell types (9.Zhou P. Fernandes N. Dodge I.L. Reddi A.L. Rao N. Safran H. DiPetrillo T.A. Wazer D.E. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13829-13837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), GA treatment (1 μm) led to a significant decrease of ErbB2 expression in myocytes (Fig. 1A). Treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (1 μm) prevented GA-induced degradation of ErbB2 (Fig. 1B). GA disruption of Hsp90-ErbB2 interaction in ARVM was evident within 1 h of treatment (Fig. 1C). Recently, the Hsp70/Hsp90 co-chaperone CHIP has been shown to function as a ubiquitin ligase toward several Hsp90 client proteins including ErbB2 (8.Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 9.Zhou P. Fernandes N. Dodge I.L. Reddi A.L. Rao N. Safran H. DiPetrillo T.A. Wazer D.E. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13829-13837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Upon GA treatment of cardiac myocytes, there was association of CHIP and Hsp70 with ErbB2 (Fig. 1D, lane 2), which further increased after 12 h of exposure to GA, despite the reduced ErbB2 expression at this time point (Fig. 1D, lane 3). Thus, ErbB2 stability is regulated by Hsp90 in myocytes and degraded via a proteasome pathway upon the disruption of Hsp-90-ErbB2, which appears to involve Hsp70 and the ubiquitin ligase CHIP.GA is a quinone that not only inhibits Hsp90-ATP interactions but is also known to undergo redox cycling, increasing the generation of reactive oxygen species (13.Dikalov S. Landmesser U. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25480-25485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To exclude nonspecific oxidant effects of GA on Hsp90 client protein stability, other agents that alter redox state were investigated. Equimolar concentrations of the quinone menadione, a potent ROS generator, did not alter ErbB2 stability (data not shown). Similarly, there was no effect of the antioxidants Mn(III) tetrakis 1-methyl 4-pyridyl porphyrin pentachloride (MnTMPyP) or N-acetyl cysteine on ErbB2 degradation induced by GA (data not shown). In addition, the non-quinone Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol reproduced the same effect on ErbB2 degradation as GA (data not shown). Thus, oxidative stress does not appear to play a role in the disruption of Hsp90/client protein interactions.Hsp90 Inhibition Alters Expression of Other Hsp90 Client Proteins—GA treatment caused alterations in the expression and function of other Hsp90 client proteins such as Akt, HSF-1, and Hsp70 that mediate cell growth and survival. With GA treatment, Akt was degraded (Fig. 2A) and HSF-1 was activated. HSF-1 is maintained in an inactive state by Hsp90 and, upon dissociation from this complex, is subjected to hyperphosphorylation with the subsequent activation of transcription (14.Hu Y. Mivechi N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17299-17306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Consistent with this literature, GA caused a shift in the molecular weight of HSF-1 within 15 min of treatment (1Fig. 2C), with the subsequent induction of Hsp70 expression after several hours (Fig. 2B). These observations demonstrate that Hsp90 exerts a generalized chaperone activity in ARVMs.Fig. 2Effects of Hsp90 inhibition on expression and activity of Hsp90 client proteins. ARVM lysates were proved for Akt (A), Hsp70 (B), or HSF-1 (C) before (Con, control) or after treatment with GA. C, lysates probed for HSF-1 after GA treatment at early time points showed a shift in its apparent molecular mass consistent with the hyperphosphorylation and activation of HSF-1. The Western blots (WB) are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Metabolic Inhibition Triggers Hsp90 Client Protein Degradation—Treatment of ARVM with either 2-deoxyglucose or antimycin A causes a significant decrease in myocyte ATP (Fig. 3, A and B). Metabolic inhibition resulted in degradation of Hsp90 client proteins (Fig. 3C), with ErbB2 exhibiting the greatest sensitivity of these client proteins. Within 1 h of 2-deoxy-d-glucose or antimycin A treatment, ErbB2 degradation was evident. The Hsp90 client proteins Raf-1 and Akt were also degraded in response to ATP depletion, although later than ErbB2. The effect of metabolic stress on ErbB2/Hsp interaction was examined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis 30 min and 1 h after 2-deoxyglucose treatment or 15 min and 1 h after antimycin A treatment. Like GA, metabolic stress caused dissociation of Hsp90 from ErbB2 (Fig. 3D), with evidence of Hsp70/ErbB2 interaction by1hof metabolic inhibition (data not shown).Fig. 3Effects of metabolic inhibition on Hsp90 client protein stability.A and B, luciferase assay was used to measure the concentration of ATP in ARVMs during treatment with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (DOG) (A) or antimycin A (B), respectively. Both compounds caused a significant decrease in [ATP] (*, p < 0.01; #, p < 0.05). C, the effect of metabolic inhibition on Hsp90 client protein stability was examined by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylation state of α-AMPK was examined as an indicator of metabolic stress. D, the effect of metabolic stress on ErbB2/Hsp90 interaction was examined by immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western blot (IB) analysis 15 min, 30 min, and 1 h after 2-deoxyglucose (DOG) or antimycin A treatments. The amount of immunoprecipitated ErbB2 was examined by reprobing with anti-ErbB2. The blots are representative of at least three separate experiments. Con, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With ATP depletion we did not see any increase in Hsp70 expression (Fig. 3C), and the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 was stable until 8 h, when there was evidence of Hsp90 degradation (Fig. 3C). In contrast to Hsp90 or Hsp70, actin expression was stable.Effects of Metabolic Inhibition on ErbB2 Ligand-dependent Signaling—We examined the effect of antimycin A or 2-deoxy-d-glucose on the activation of an intracellular kinase signal by exogenous NRG-1β and epidermal growth factor (EGF), ligands that activate and signal in part through ErbB2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Under control conditions, Akt and ERK are activated by NRG (50 ng/ml) and 10% fetal calf serum, with EGF causing only weak activation of ERK. After 1 h of antimycin A treatment, all ligand-dependent signaling was suppressed. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose treatment for 2 h suppressed ERK and Akt signaling by NRG and fetal calf serum but had no clear effect on EGF-dependent ERK activation. As kinase signaling is itself dependent on ATP, this result could be explained by either a disruption of Hsp90-ErbB2 interactions leading to ErbB2 degradation or simply to an insufficient supply of ATP to allow kinase activity. Therefore, we allowed cells to recover by washing away antimycin A and adding back glucose. After 1 h of antimycin A treatment followed by ATP recovery, there was no increase in ErbB2. Interestingly, recovery induced Akt phosphorylation but did not restore NRG-dependent signaling (Fig. 4C). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was completely suppressed by antimycin A treatment, and induced during ATP recovery, with no discernible effect of NRG in the presence of antimycin A (Fig. 4C). NRG activation of JNKs was also suppressed by antimycin A treatment, although JNK phosphorylation could be seen with ATP recovery alone, similar to ERK1/2 (Fig. 4C). The increased phosphorylation of AMPK during antimycin A treatment demonstrates that ATP levels are sufficient to support protein kinase activity in general. It is interesting that neuregulin alone appears to induce phosphorylation of α-AMPK, which has not previously been reported. Collectively, these data demonstrate that ATP depletion activates Hsp90 client protein degradation, which renders myocytes insensitive to growth factor-stimulated kinase signaling.Fig. 4Effects of metabolic inhibition on ErbB2 signaling. Phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), phosphorylated ERK (pErk), and total Akt were examined by Western blot analysis after treatment with 2 μm antimycin A (AA) for 1 h (A) or 5 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose for 2 h (B) followed by growth factor stimulation for 15 min. A, antimycin A treatment for 1 h suppressed NRG, EGF, and serum signaling. B, 2 h of 2-deoxy-d-glucose treatment suppressed ERK and Akt signaling activated by NRG and fetal calf serum but had no clear effect on EGF-dependent ERK activation. The blots are representative of four separate experiments. C, ATP recovery was induced by washing in 1,000 mg/liter d-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min prior to stimulation by NRG-1β. ErbB2 expression did not increase with recovery, and NRG-1β activation of pAkt was not restored by ATP recovery. Blots are representative of three separate experiments. Con, control. pJNK, phosphorylated JNK; pAMPK, phosphorylated AMPK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Physiological Stress Causes ErbB2 Degradation—To examine whether physiological metabolic stress can activate Hsp90 client protein degradation, we examined the effect of electrical pacing and β-AR on ErbB2 expression (Fig. 5). Both β-AR stimulation and mechanical stimulation increase oxygen consumption and ATP utilization (15.Gorman M.W. Ning X.H. He M.X. Portman M.A. Sparks H.V. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we have shown previously under these conditions that myocytes are insensitive to neuregulin 1-β cytoprotection (11.Kuramochi Y. Lim C.C. Guo X. Colucci W.S. Liao R. Sawyer D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 286: C222-C229Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Neither pacing alone (p > 0.05) nor β-AR stimulation (NE plus prazosin at 100 nm) (p > 0.05) altered ErbB2 expression. However the combination caused marked ErbB2 degradation (Fig. 5B; #, p < 0.05; *, p < 0.01), explaining the resistance to NRG cytoprotection under these conditions.Fig. 5Metabolic stress causes ErbB2 degradation.A, ErbB2, Akt, and actin expression were examined by immunoblot in myocytes electrically stimulated or left quiescent for 4 h in the absence (0 μm) or presence of NE (0.1 and 1 μm). The blots are representative of three separate experiments. B, ErbB2 expression was analyzed by densitometry and normalized to untreated myocytes without (W/O) pacing. ErbB2 expression decreased in ARVM electrically paced and treated with a pharmacologic concentration of NE. #, p < 0.05; *, p < 0.01; n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur present findings demonstrate a role for Hsp90 in regulating the stability of ErbB2 and other Hsp90 client proteins in relation to cellular energy charge. This observation is consistent with the recently published report on the relative affinity of Hsp90 for ATP versus ADP (5.Carreras C.W. Schirmer A. Zhong Z. Santi D.V. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 317: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the well known importance of ATP binding and hydrolysis by Hsp90 in the formation and function of protein heterocomplexes (16.Owen B.A. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7086-7091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17.Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This result may provide some insight into the physiological role of Hsp90 chaperone activity, placing Hsp90 into a group of proteins that sense energy charge and modulate growth factor responsiveness.We have focused our attention on how ATP depletion alters Hsp90 stabilization of ErbB2, a member of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family that plays a key role in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration and has emerged as an important contributing factor in tumorigenesis (18.Xu W. Mimnaugh E. Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C. Marcu M. Yarden Y. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3702-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In the heart, ErbB2 is critical for cardiac development (19.Lee K.F. Simon H. Chen H. Bates B. Hung M.C. Hauser C. Nature. 1995; 378: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) as well as for the maintenance of cardiac function postnatally (20.Schneider J.W. Chang A.Y. Rocco T.P. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 18-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings that ErbB2 expression in cardiac myocytes is stabilized by Hsp90 and that degradation is mediated by the CHIP/Hsp70/proteosomal pathway is predictable based upon in vitro work with cell lines (9.Zhou P. Fernandes N. Dodge I.L. Reddi A.L. Rao N. Safran H. DiPetrillo T.A. Wazer D.E. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13829-13837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 21.Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of this mechanism in a cell expressing endogenous levels of ErbB2 and Hsp90, as well as its activation by metabolic stress in any cell type.This is only one of the mechanisms for ErbB2 degradation, as both EGF- and antibody-induced ErbB2 degradation are mediated through the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase Cbl to ErbB2 autophosphorylated at Tyr-1112 (22.Levkowitz G. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Freywald A. Sela M. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1117-1125PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Klapper L.N. Waterman H. Sela M. Yarden Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3384-3388PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase activity of ErbB2 is essential for Cbl-dependent ubiquitinylation and down-regulation. In contrast, ErbB2 down-regulation induced by the Hsp90 inhibitor GA requires the kinase domain but not the kinase activity of ErbB2, and the C-terminal tail carrying the Cbl-binding site is dispensable (23.Klapper L.N. Waterman H. Sela M. Yarden Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3384-3388PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that distinct mechanisms are involved in ligand-associated ErbB2 degradation versus that induced by the disruption of Hsp90 chaperone activity.We found that the sensitivity of Hsp90 client proteins differs in response to metabolic stress, with some proteins showing earlier evidence of degradation than others. For both conditions of metabolic stress, the rank order of sensitivity appears to be ErbB2 > Raf-1 > Akt. One explanation for this finding is that Hsp90 client protein interactions have differential sensitivity to ATP/ADP ratios. In contrast to the effect of GA, Hsp70 expression did not increase with ATP depletion. Thus, HSF-1 and the classic heat shock response are not activated by ATP depletion in cardiac myocytes, in contrast to what has been observed in kidney cells (24.Ruchalski K. Mao H. Singh S.K. Wang Y. Mosser D.D. Li F. Schwartz J.H. Borkan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. 2003; 285: C1483-C1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).

In particular, β subunits affect the time course of the Ba2+ current decay up to 3-fold depending on the type of the β subunit. To study conformational rearrangements in the channel in response to depolarization, measurements of differential changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the cyan (ECFP) and yellow (EYFP) fluorescent proteins fused to the α1C and β subunit termini have been an effective approach. The current findings begin to specify the central features of conformational rearrangements associated with the transition of the channel from the resting (–90 mV) to the inactivated state of Cav1.2. With the (EYFP)N-α1C,77-(ECFP)C/β1a/α2δ channel as a model, FRET microscopy showed reversible voltage-gated rearrangements between the α1C,77 tails and pointed to a role for the C-terminal mobile tail in intracellular Ca2+ signal transduction (5.Kobrinsky E.

To investigate further the role of voltage-gated mobility of the α1C,77 N-terminal tail for function of the Cav1.2 channel, here we have investigated the effects of N-terminal deletion or plasma membrane immobilization on Ca2+- and voltage-dependent inactivation, as well as β subunit regulation of the channel. Most interestingly, if the α1C/α2δ channel is assembled without a β subunit, either deletion or anchoring of the α1C,77 N-terminal tail results in high amplitude non-inactivating Ba2+ or Ca2+ currents. This provides a mechanism to explain how limited mobility of the α1C subunit N-terminal tail integrates the β subunit and the α1C subunit C terminus in inactivation of the channel. Molecular Biology—Reverse transcription-PCR cloning of human hippocampal α1C subunit (see Supplemental Material) showed substantial diversity of the transcripts because of alternative splicing. The exon-22 isoform (GenBank™ accession number Z34815) of the human hippocampus α1C subunit, known as α1C,77 (21.Soldatov N.M. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol.

Nucleotide sequences of all PCR and ligation products were confirmed at the DNA sequencing facility of the University of Maryland. The β1a and α2δ subunits in pcDNA3 vector were prepared as described by Soldatov et al. (24.Soldatov N.M. Zhenochin S. AlBanna B. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Membr.

Transient Expression in COS1 Cells—COS1 cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). For transient Ca2+ channel expression, cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (MatTek) 18 h before transfection with cDNAs coding for the indicated α1C, β1a, and α2δ subunits of the Ca2+ channel (1:1:1, w/w) using an Effectene kit (Qiagen) according to the protocol described previously (20.Kobrinsky E.

Transfected cells were visualized by ECFP or EYFP tags genetically fused to the α1C subunits. In some experiments, the Gαq Q209L mutant (The Guthrie Research Institute, Sayre, PA) was co-expressed with Ca2+ channel subunits. Electrophysiological Experiments—Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C) using the Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) 48–72 h after transfection. The extracellular bath solution contained the following (in mm): 100 NaCl, 20 BaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4, with NaOH. Borosilicate glass pipettes were fire-polished and showed a typical resistance of 3–6 megohms when filled with pipette solution containing the following (in mm): 110 CsCl, 5 MgATP, 10 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 20 tetraethylammonium, 0.2 cAMP, and 20 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH (24.Soldatov N.M.

Currents were sampled at 2.5–5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Voltage protocols were generated, and data were digitized, recorded, and analyzed using pClamp 8.1 software (Axon Instruments). The holding potential (Vh) was –90 mV, and test pulses were applied at 30-s intervals. Current-voltage (I-V) curves were obtained by step depolarizations to test potentials in the range of –60 to +50 mV (with 10-mV increments) applied from the holding potential. Statistical values are given as means ± S.E. Single channel recordings were carried out in cell-attached configurations at 24 °C in the bath solution containing the following (in mm): 110 l-aspartic acid, 20 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 EGTA, and 20 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH. The pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 110 BaCl2, 5 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The pipettes were heat-polished and showed resistances of 3–4.5 megohms. Step depolarizations to the indicated potentials were applied from Vh = –90 mV for 1 s followed by inter-pulse intervals of 5 s. Currents were sampled at 40 kHz and low pass-filtered with a gauss filter at 500 Hz. Histograms with a bin size of 0.03 pA were fit with a sum of two gauss functions. Single channel data were analyzed using Clampfit 9.2 software (Axon Instruments) FRET measurements were combined with whole-cell patch clamp as described in detail by Kobrinsky et al. (5.Kobrinsky E.

Images were recorded with a Hamamatsu digital camera C4742-95 mounted on the Nikon epifluorescent microscope TE200 (60 × 1.2 N.A. objective) equipped with an excitation 75-watt xenon lamp and multiple filter sets (Chroma Technology). Acquisition and analysis of FRET images were carried out with C-Imaging (Compix) and MetaMorph (Universal Imaging) software packages. Conditions for the measurements of corrected images of FRET between (ECFP)N-PH and (EYFP)N-α1C,77 in the absence or on the presence of the β1a subunit closely matched those described recently (20.Kobrinsky E.

Our goal in this study was to reveal the role of the α1C,77 subunit C- and N-terminal tails in inactivation of the Cav1.2 channel and its regulation by β subunits. To simplify the interpretation of the results, in most of this series of experiments we used the protein kinase C-insensitive Cav1.2 assembled with the α1C,77 subunit identified in human hippocampus (see Supplemental Material). Our previous experiments (5.Kobrinsky E. Schwartz E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5021-5028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20.Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M.

Measurements of state-dependent FRET, as an indicator of the voltage-gated rearrangements of the ECFP/EYFP-labeled channel, have demonstrated significant mobility of the α1C subunit C-terminal tail and its crucial role for Ca2+ signal transduction, contrasting with a relatively weak β subunit dependent mobility of the α1C N terminus. Effect of Plasma Membrane Immobilization of the α1C C Terminus on CDI, Voltage-dependent Inactivation, and Ion Selectivity of the Channel—In the first set of experiments, the C terminus of the α1C,77 subunit was immobilized to the plasma membrane via the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of phospholipase Cδ1. To prepare the plasmid encoding α1C,77-(PH-ECFP)C, the PH domain was genetically fused to the last C-terminal Leu-2138 residue of the α1C,77 subunit, and the reading frame was completed with the ECFP-coding sequence. The β subunit-deficient α1C,77-(ECFP)C/α2δ channel was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and did not show substantial membrane targeting (for details, see Harry et al. (26.Harry J.B. Kobrinsky E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46367-46372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). The C-terminal fusion of the PH domain was sufficient to direct the plasma membrane insertion of the channel, as one can see from the distribution of the ECFP fluorescence across the cell (Fig. 1A, inset). When co-expressed in COS1 cells with the α2δ subunit but in the absence of β subunits (Fig. 1A), the α1C,77-(PH-ECFP)C/α2δ channel generated only a minute Ba2+ current in response to a +10-mV depolarization applied from Vh = –90 mV. However, when α2δ and α1C,77-(PH-ECFP)C were co-expressed with the β1a subunit (Fig. 1B), the amplitude of the Ba2+ current increased severalfold, and the current decay exhibited a distinctly prolonged plateau at approximately half-maximum of the current. Fig. 1C shows a set of the representative traces of the Ba2+ current evoked by 600-ms test pulses in the range of 0 to +50 mV (10-mV increments) applied from Vh = –90 mV. The corresponding averaged I-V relation is presented in Fig. 1D. The most prominent feature of the Ba2+ current through the channel with the plasma membrane-anchored α1C subunit C terminus was the sustained component of the current (Fig. 1D, open circles in the I-V curve) that, in a wide range of the current-evoking potentials, composed 35.5 ± 3.5% (n = 7) of the total Ba2+ current (from 31.4% at –10 mV to 56.1% at +50 mV). The sustained current was preceded by a rapidly inactivating component with the fast time constant τf of 20.0 ± 5.0 ms (at +20 mV; n = 9). Overall, the anchoring of the α1C subunit C terminus in the plasma membrane accelerated fast inactivation and inhibited slow inactivation of the Ba2+ current. Release of the α1C,77 subunit C-tail could be stimulated by the hydrolysis of the PH domain PIP2 upon activation of phospholipase C. In previous studies, we demonstrated that activation of PIP2 hydrolysis by epidermal growth factor-mediated stimulation of the co-expressed epidermal growth factor receptors helped to fully restore the CDI and voltage-dependent slow inactivation of the channel (5.Kobrinsky E. Schwartz E. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5021-5028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because the epidermal growth factor-mediated recovery was transient and additionally complicated by inhibition of the channel activity (27.Wu L. Buer C.S. Zhen X.-G. Xie C. Yang J. Nature. 2002; 419: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effects of the co-expression of the constitutively active mutant (Q209L) of the Gαq protein that depletes the plasma membrane PIP2 (e.g. see Howes et al. (28.Howes A.L. Arthur J.F. Zhang T. Miyamoto S. Adams J.W. Dorn II, G.W. Woodcock E.A. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40343-40351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)). Fig. 1E (inset) shows the fluorescence image of a COS1 cell co-expressing the α1C,77-(PH-ECFP)C, α2δ, and β1a subunits, the Gαq Q209L mutant, and representative traces of the Ba2+ current generated in response to step depolarizations in the range of +10 to +40 mV applied from Vh = –90 mV. Co-expression of the Gαq Q209L mutant shifted inactivation of the channels to the normal phenotype with a prominent slow component. Single exponential fitting shows the time constant of the Ba2+ current decay of 200 ± 38 ms (at +10 mV; n = 9) and the lack of sustained component. The inability of the channel with the immobilized C-terminal tail to complete inactivation was corroborated by the analysis of steady-state inactivation properties (Fig. 1F). Approximately 70% of the Ba2+ current through the α1C,77-(PH-ECFP)C/α2δ/β1a channel evoked by a +10-mV depolarization remained non-inactivated after a depolarizing prepulse in a range of –10 to +50 mV was applied from Vh = –90 mV prior to the +10-mV test pulse (Fig. 1F, closed circles). The release of the α1C,77 C-tail restored inactivation of the channel, as can be seen from a comparison of the Ba2+ current decay (Fig. 1E) and steady-state inactivation curves recorded in the absence and in the presence of the constitutively active Gαq Q209L mutant (Fig. 1F). Cav1.2 channels classically inactivate by a combination of the voltage- and Ca2+-dependent mechanisms. One of the main consequences of the replacement of Ba2+ for Ca2+ as the charge carrier is an acceleration of the macroscopic current decay or CDI (29.Zhou J. Olcese R. Qin N. Noceti F. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2301-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, this was not found to hold true for the C-terminal tail-anchored Ca2+ channel. Indeed, the representative traces of the Ca2+ current through the α1C,77-(PH-ECFP)C/α2δ/β1a channel (Fig. 1G), recorded from the same cell as Ba2+ currents in Fig. 1C, show both inactivating and sustained components of the decay. Similar to the Ba2+ current, the large sustained Ca2+ current components lasted for the duration of depolarization at all indicated test pulses (+20 to +50 mV). Although the fast component of inactivation was not as prominent as in the case of the Ba2+ current, the average fraction of the sustained currents (44.9 ± 2.3%, from 33.3% at –10 mV to 48.6% at +50 mV, Fig. 1H) was essentially the same as with Ba2+ as the charge carrier. All these features of the C-terminal tail-anchored α1C,77-(PH-ECFP)C channel closely matched the phenotype of the α1C,IS-IV channel, which has the slow inactivation mechanism inhibited by the specific mutation in the cytoplasmic pore region (30.Shi C. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6813-6821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The I-V relations for the Ba2+- and Ca2+-conducting α1C,77-(PH-ECFP)C channel show a number of common patterns (Fig. 1, D and H). Immobilization of the α1C,77 subunit C-terminal tail caused a shift in activation of ion conductance by 10–15 mV to more positive potentials. Currents reached the peak of the I-V relationship at +20 (Ca2+) or +30 mV (Ba2+), exhibiting a 10–20-mV shift of the maximum toward more positive voltages as compared with the α1C,77-(ECFP)C/α2δ/β1a channel. The apparent reversal potential was also notably changed. Both the Ba2+ and Ca2+ currents reversed direction at much higher voltages than in the wild-type channel. Although this effect was not investigated in detail, it may be due to altered ion selectivity and/or decreased permeability to Cs+ ions (introduced in electrodes) in the outward direction that contributed significantly to the apparent reversal potential of the wild-type channel (≈ +65 mV) (31.Zhou Z. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 523: 57-66Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Release of the α1C,77-(PH-ECFP)C subunit C-terminal tail by co-expression of the Gαq Q209L mutant reversed these changes in the I-V relationship to parameters that are more characteristic for the α1C,77-(ECFP)C/α2δ/β1a channel, including ion selectivity and the peak current voltage (Fig. 1D, filled squares). The permeability of the wild type α1C,77 channel to Ba2+ is on average 2.8 times greater than that of the Ca2+ ions (24.Soldatov N.M. Zhenochin S. AlBanna B. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 177: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30.Shi C. Soldatov N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6813-6821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immobilization of the α1C subunit C-tail reduced the difference between the maximum amplitudes of the Ba2+ and Ca2+ currents (compare traces in Fig. 1, C and G), again indicating that the anchoring of the α1C subunit C-terminal tail may affect the ion conductance of the channel. Taken together, these data support the model (7.Soldatov N.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 167-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that links CDI and slow inactivation of the Cav1.2 channel to specific folding of the α1C subunit C terminus vis à vis the cytoplasmic pore region. β Subunit Facilitation of the Cav1.2 Channel Gating Is Revealed by Immobilization of the α1C Subunit N-terminal Tail—In the second set of experiments, the N-terminal tail of the (EYFP)N-α1C,77 subunit was anchored to the plasma membrane via the PH domain. The (PH-EYFP)N-α1C,77 channel was expressed in COS1 cells in different combinations with auxiliary β1a and α2δ subunits. Fig. 2 shows a collection of representative traces of the Ba2+ current elicited by depolarization to +10 mV from Vh = –90 mV in a set of COS1 cells of approximately similar size. The insets in Fig. 2 are fluorescent images of the expressing cells showing subcellular localization of the EYFP-tagged α1C subunits. Confirming earlier data (32.Meir A. Bell D.C. Stephens G.J.

Transfection of COS1 cells with a mixture of cDNAs coding for the (EYFP)N-α1C,77, β1a and α2δ subunits (Fig. 2B) renders the current with characteristics (Fig. 3, curves 3) closely resembling those of the wild-type channel (24.Soldatov N.M. Zhenochin S. AlBanna B. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 177: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Anchoring of the α1C subunit N terminus by co-expression of (PH-EYFP)N-α1C,77 with the β1a and α2δ subunits (Fig. 2C) accelerated the kinetics of inactivation of the Ba2+ current by ∼15% (5.Kobrinsky E.

An acceleration of inactivation was also seen when the PH domain was separately co-expressed with the (EYFP)N-α1C,77, β1a, and α2δ subunits (Fig. 2D). Making no assumptions about the nature of these variations, we investigated the effect of the deletion of the β1a subunit from the expressed constituents of the channel.Fig. 3Effect of the β subunit on inactivation properties of the Ca2+ channel with the N terminus of the α1C subunit immobilized in the plasma membrane. The (PH-EYFP)N-α1C,77 and α2δ subunits were co-expressed in COS1 cells with (curve 1) or without β1a (curve 2).

Here we demonstrate that the cell surface expression of CD147 is regulated by cyclophilins via the transmembrane domain of CD147. Solution binding experiments demonstrated that the transmembrane domain was both necessary and sufficient for CD147 binding to cyclophilin A (CypA). Treatment with cyclosporin A significantly reduced surface expression of CD147 and of CD8-CD147 fusion protein carrying the extracellular domain of CD8 fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CD147, but did not affect expression of CD8. Peptide binding studies demonstrated specific interaction between CypA and the proline-containing peptide from the CD147 transmembrane domain. Mutation of this proline residue reduced binding of CD147-derived peptides to CypA and also diminished transport of CD147 to the plasma membrane without reducing the total level of CD147 expression. These results suggest involvement of a cyclophilin-related protein in CD147 cell surface expression and provide molecular details for regulation of CD147 trafficking by cyclophilins.

CD147 is a type 1 integral membrane protein shown to regulate intercellular adhesion pathways through an intracellular signaling mediated mechanism (1Kasinrerk W. Tokrasinwit N. Phunpae P. Immunology. 1999; 96: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is also known as extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), 1The abbreviations used are: EMMPRIN, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer; CypA, cyclophilin A; PPIase, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CsA, cyclosporin A; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PE, phycoerythrin; MIF, migration inhibitory factor; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PerCP, peridinin chlorophyll protein. and studies by Biswas and co-workers (2Ellis S.M.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 434-439PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that EMMPRIN expressed by cultured tumor cells stimulates fibroblasts to produce very high levels of collagenase activity, which likely facilitates tumor metastasis. To support its key role in the processes of tumorigenesis and metastasis, EMMPRIN was reported as one of the most constantly up-regulated mRNAs in metastatic cells (4Klein C.A. Seidl S. Petat-Dutter K. Offner S. Geigl J.B. Schmidt-Kittler O. Wendler N. Passlick B. Huber R.M. Schlimok G. Baeuerle P.A. Riethmuller G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Another physiologic role of CD147 relates to its activity as a receptor for extracellular cyclophilins (5Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T. Guo H. Hung H.C. Toole B. Gallay P. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol.

Commun. 2001; 288: 786-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because cyclophilins emerge as mediators of intercellular communication that may regulate chemotactic responses in many physiologic and pathologic processes, such as cell-mediated immunity and inflammation (7Bukrinsky M.I. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 323-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), regulation of CD147 expression may determine the outcome of these events. The fact that CD147 interacts with extracellular cyclophilins in a cyclosporin-sensitive fashion (5Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T. Guo H. Hung H.C. Toole B. Gallay P. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22959-22965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) suggests that such an interaction may also occur intracellularly, where cyclophilins are abundant. Cyclophilins are a family of proteins that share peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity and serve as receptors for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). The PPIase activity of cyclophilins is the basis for their proposed role in protein folding (8Ivery M.T. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 452-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, cyclophilins also bind folded proteins, raising the possibility that certain functions of mature proteins may be regulated by cyclophilins. An example of such activity is the inhibitory effect of cyclophilin A (CypA), a prototypic member of the cyclophilin family, on the tyrosine kinase Itk (9Brazin K.N. Mallis R.J. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which is essential for the maintenance of proper CD4+ T cell responses (10Colgan J.

Another established activity of cyclophilins is regulation of protein trafficking in cells. Cyclophilin A has been shown to be a component of the transport complexes that regulate surface expression of asialoglycoprotein receptor expression in human cells (11Huang T. Deng H. Wolkoff A.W. Stockert R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37798-37803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In yeast, CypA was shown to mediate the import of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase into intermediate transport vesicles for vacuole delivery (12Brown C.R. Cui D.Y. Hung G.G. Chiang H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48017-48026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and to promote nuclear export of Zpr1, an essential zinc finger protein (13Ansari H. Greco G. Luban J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6993-7003Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Drosophila cyclophilin homolog NinaA participates in trafficking of rhodopsin, the most abundant subclass of photoreceptors (14Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 15Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S.

NinaA and its mammalian counterparts are retina-expressed integral membrane proteins with the cyclophilin-homologous domain located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and intracellular transport vehicles (15Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4886-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 17Ferreira P.A. Hom J.T. Pak W.L. J. Biol.

Cell. 1991; 65: 219-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In all these examples, except interaction with Zpr1, cyclophilins were found to form a specific stable complex with the substrate, suggesting that they function as a chaperone escorting its protein substrate through the traffic pathway. Recent reports (19Shiraishi S. Yokoo H. Kobayashi H. Yanagita T. Uezono Y. Minami S. Takasaki M. Wada A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 293: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Chklovskaia E. Nissen C. Landmann L. Rahner C. Pfister O. Wodnar-Filipowicz A. Blood. 2001; 97: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggest that cyclophilins may be involved in cell surface externalization of two other proteins, namely insulin receptor and Flt3 ligand. In both cases, treatment of the cells with CsA reduced surface expression of the proteins without altering their total cellular levels, suggesting a block at the level of transition from the endoplasmic reticulum to trans-Golgi network. The cyclophilin(s) involved in regulation of trafficking of these proteins have not yet been identified. The mechanisms by which cyclophilins regulate protein trafficking remain unknown. Molecular studies of Drosophila ninaA mutants have shown that CsA has only a minor effect on rhodopsin transport, and ninaA mutations need not be within the PPIase/CsA-binding domain to cause severe reductions in rhodopsin levels (21Ondek B.

Nature. 1989; 338: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of the Flt3 ligand and insulin receptor, on the other hand, was greatly reduced by CsA, suggesting involvement of the PPIase/CsA-binding domain of cyclophilin in the regulation of trafficking of these proteins (19Shiraishi S. Yokoo H. Kobayashi H. Yanagita T. Uezono Y. Minami S. Takasaki M. Wada A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 293: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Chklovskaia E. Nissen C. Landmann L. Rahner C. Pfister O. Wodnar-Filipowicz A. Blood. 2001; 97: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the cyclophilin-interacting domain within these target proteins has not been determined. Analysis of CD147 cell surface expression revealed its unexpected sensitivity to CsA, suggesting involvement of a cyclophilin in the regulation of CD147 intracellular trafficking. In this report, we present evidence that sensitivity to CsA is eliminated by mutating a single proline residue in the transmembrane domain of CD147. Mutation of this residue abrogates binding of cyclophilin to CD147 and also reduces the cell surface expression of CD147. These results suggest that intracellular trafficking of CD147/EMMPRIN is regulated by a cyclophilin. Antibodies and Reagents—FITC- or PE-conjugated anti-CD147 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Ancell (Bayport, MN); PerCP-conjugated anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody was from BD Biosciences, and PE-labeled anti-CD71 monoclonal antibody was from Caltag (Burlingame, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-CypA antibody was from US Biological (Swampscott, MA). Cyclosporin A was purchased from Sigma. Plasmids and Transfection—Complementary DNAs for human CypA and CypB were cloned into the pET14b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Cyclophilins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by using the histidine-binding methodology as described (24Sherry B. Zybarth G. Alfano M. Dubrovsky L. Mitchell R. Rich D. Ulrich P.

All mutations were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla) and verified by DNA sequence analysis. For protein expression in mammalian cells, cells were transfected using Metafectene (Biontex, Munich, Germany), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Efficiency of transfection of CHO K1 and HEK 293T was routinely 20–30%. For solution binding studies, DNA fragments encoding the full-length (lacking only the signal peptide) or truncated versions of CD147, CD8 α-chain, and CD8/CD147 chimeric protein were cloned into the pT7Blue2 vector (Novagen) and expressed using the TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI). Solution Binding Assay—Affinity resins were prepared by coupling recombinant human CypA or CypB to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control resin was prepared similarly, except that cyclophilins were either replaced by the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) or omitted entirely during the coupling step. Binding reactions were performed using [35S]methionine/[14C]leucine-labeled proteins for 90 min at room temperature in the binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8; 150 mm KOAc; 2 mm Mg(OAc)2; 2 mm dithiothreitol; 0.1% Tween 20; 0.1% casamino acids; protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Unbound proteins were removed by washing the resin three times with the binding buffer, and then bound proteins were eluted with the Laemmli buffer and revealed by electrophoresis and autoradiography. HPLC Analysis—Peptides (2 μm each) were incubated with CypA (1 μm) overnight in the HPLC binding buffer (100 mm NH4OAc, pH 8.5) at 4 °C. Unbound peptides were removed by centrifugation through the gel filtration Micro Bio-Spin P6 chromatography column (Bio-Rad). Material that passed through the column was loaded on the C18 column and analyzed by the reverse phase HPLC (running gradient program from 20 to 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 60 min). Mass Spectral Analysis by MALDI-TOF—Peptides (50 μm) were incubated at room temperature in the presence or absence of CypA (10 μm) for 45 min, at which time the reaction mixture was run through a Micro Bio-Spin P-6 column (Bio-Rad) to remove unbound peptide. Samples of the starting material and the flow-through fraction from the column (containing CypA and bound peptide) were lyophilized, dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, desalted by passing through a ZipTip C18 (Millipore, Billeric, MA) according to manufacturer's instructions, and loaded on mass spectrometer for analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on the Kratos Kompact SEQ (Kratos Analytical, Chestnut Ridge, NY) machine using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) as a matrix. Measurements were taken in the linear delayed extraction mode, with external calibration. Analysis of CD147 Expression after Subtilisin Treatment—U937 (human monocytic cell line) or HEK 293T (human embryonic kidney epithelial) cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were treated with 0.3 mg/ml subtilisin B (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and incubated in RPMI, 10% fetal bovine serum with or without CsA (5 μg/ml). Samples were collected for analysis before the subtilisin treatment, immediately after the treatment, and following various incubation times. Cells were stained with anti-CD147-FITC or anti-CD4-PerCP (U937 cells) or PE-conjugated anti-CD147 or anti-CD71 (HEK 293T cells) antibodies (or fluorescently labeled isotype controls) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy—HEK 293T cells cultured on polylysine-coated coverslips (BD Biosciences) were transfected with the vector encoding the CD147-GFP fusion protein (25Zucker S. Hymowitz M. Rollo E.E. Mann R. Conner C.E. Cao J. Foda H.D. Tompkins D.C. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1921-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). 16–18 h after transfection, cells were washed and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, followed by a 15-min incubation at room temperature in 100 mm glycine in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl). Following three washes with PBS, slides were blocked with 4% goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then stained with mouse monoclonal antibody against the Golgi matrix protein GM130 (BD Biosciences) followed by rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Slides were viewed in an Olympus IT-2 microscope attached to a Bio-Rad 1024MRC scanning confocal system. Images were collected with a ×60 objective.

This result implies the presence of a cyclophilin-binding site on CD147, which could also bind cyclophilin intracellularly. Previous reports (14Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 19Shiraishi S. Yokoo H. Kobayashi H. Yanagita T. Uezono Y. Minami S. Takasaki M. Wada A. Neurosci.

Blood. 2001; 97: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) implicated cyclophilins in regulation of cell surface expression of several transmembrane proteins, e.g. rhodopsin, insulin receptor, or Flt3 ligand. We therefore hypothesized that surface expression of CD147 could be regulated by a cyclophilin. To start addressing this question, we tested the effect of cyclosporin A on the cell surface localization of CD147. Because we failed to find a human cell line that does not express CD147, we used hamster CHO cells and transfected them with a vector expressing human CD147. As shown in Fig. 1 (panels in the left column), a marked decrease in CD147 expression was observed in the presence of CsA. In contrast, the expression of human CD8 in CHO cells transfected with a CD8-expressing vector was not affected by CsA (panels in the right column). This result suggests that CD147 expression is regulated by cyclophilin and involves its PPIase/CsA-binding domain. This effect could be due to diminished expression of the constructs or inefficient transport to the plasma membrane. To discriminate between these two possible mechanisms, we investigated the effect of CsA on expression of the CD147 construct carrying GFP linked at the C-terminal end, which has been shown previously (25Zucker S. Hymowitz M. Rollo E.E. Mann R. Conner C.E. Cao J. Foda H.D. Tompkins D.C. Toole B.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1921-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) to be physiologically similar to the wild-type CD147. Analysis of CD147 expression demonstrated that CsA significantly reduced the surface expression of CD147-GFP without affecting total GFP expression (Fig. 2). Results presented so far show the effect of CsA on CD147 expression in transfected CHO cells. To test whether CsA blocked surface expression of endogenous CD147 in human cells, we treated a human promonocytic cell line, U937, with subtilisin to strip cells of surface CD147, and we then monitored re-expression of CD147 on the cell surface in the presence or absence of CsA. These experiments demonstrated that CD147 surface expression was reconstituted to almost original levels 24 h after subtilisin treatment (lightly shaded peaks in Fig. 3A); longer incubation led to only a small increase in CD147 expression (not shown). Results presented in Fig. 3A show a consistent decrease in the re-expression of CD147 on the cell surface in the presence of CsA (Fig. 3A, peaks with dark shading). Most importantly, CsA did not affect re-expression of CD4 after subtilisin treatment (Fig. 3A, right panels), indicating that the observed effect was not due to toxicity of CsA and that it was specific for CD147. By using the same approach, we studied the effect of CsA on CD147 surface expression in adherent human cells, HEK 293T. As shown in Fig. 3B, CD147 surface expression on HEK 293T cells was greatly reduced by subtilisin treatment (peak with light shading) but was almost completely restored after 12 h. Similar to the results with U937 cells (Fig. 3A), in the presence of CsA expression of CD147 12 h after subtilisin treatment was reduced by almost 2-fold as revealed by reduction of the mean fluorescence intensity in the CsA-treated culture (RMFI = 1.9, Fig. 3B). Most importantly, no such reduction was observed with the transferrin receptor (CD71), another transmembrane protein, thus indicating the specificity of the CsA effect. To visualize intracellular localization of CD147, we transfected HEK 293T cells with the CD147-GFP-expressing vector and analyzed CD147 localization in CsA-treated and untreated cells by confocal fluorescent microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3C, cell surface localization of CD147-GFP was reduced in CsA-treated cells, consistent with results in Fig. 3, A and B. Moreover, as expected for the transmembrane protein, CD147 partially co-localized with the Golgi marker (Golgi matrix protein GM130), and this co-localization substantially increased in CsA-treated cells (Fig. 3C, yellow staining in the merged image). Taken together, results presented in this section suggest that transport of CD147 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane is regulated by a cyclophilin and may involve the active (PPIase) site of the cyclophilin molecule. Most importantly, this mechanism operates in both nonadherent (U937) and adherent (CHO and HEK 293T) human and non-human cells. Cyclophilin-binding Site on CD147, the Critical Role of Pro211—To gain further insight into the mechanisms of cyclophilin-mediated regulation of CD147 expression, we wanted to identify the domain of CD147 responsible for interaction with cyclophilins. Because CD147 interaction with cyclophilin appears to involve the PPIase domain (it is sensitive to CsA) and cyclophilins are highly homologous in their active site (26Gothel S.F. Marahiel M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), we used readily available recombinant CypA for these studies. To identify the cyclophilin-binding region in CD147, we expressed truncated forms of CD147 composed of the extracellular domain alone (CD147.e), extracellular and transmembrane domains (CD147.et), or extracellular and cytoplasmic domains (CD147.ec) fused in-frame (Fig. 4A), and we performed binding analyses using immobilized CypA and these constructs. Specific binding was observed with the full-length CD147 (CD147.etc) and CD147.et constructs, which expressed the extracellular and transmembrane domains (Fig. 4B). No binding was detected with the CD147.e or CD147.ec constructs, which expressed the extracellular domain but did not include the transmembrane domain of the protein. This result was unexpected, given that CD147 has been shown to function as a receptor for extracellular CypA (5Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T. Guo H. Hung H.C. Toole B. Gallay P. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22959-22965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using CypB-coated beads (not shown), suggesting that interaction with the CD147 transmembrane domain may involve the active site common to all cyclophilins. To test whether the transmembrane domain of CD147 was both necessary and sufficient to bind cyclophilin, we constructed a fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of the CD8 α-chain (which does not bind CypA, Fig. 4C, lane 5) fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CD147 (CD8.e/CD147.tc). When expressed in CHO cells, this construct was susceptible to CsA inhibition, similar to CD147 (Fig. 1, panels in the middle column). A specific binding interaction was detected between this construct and CypA-coated beads (Fig. 4C, lane 4). To rule out the possibility of a nonspecific binding to the beads, we performed a similar analysis with beads coated with the macrophage MIF, a cytokine with molecular mass similar to that of CypA (28Bernhagen J. Calandra T. Bucala R. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). No binding was detected (Fig. 4C, lanes 6–9), supporting the specificity of the interaction between CD147 and CypA. Taken together, these results suggest that the transmembrane region of CD147 is both necessary and sufficient for the binding interaction with CypA in solution. To map precisely the CypA-interacting region within the CD147 transmembrane domain, we synthesized three peptides (P1–P3) covering contiguous areas of the domain (Fig. 5A). Because these peptides were very hydrophobic and could be dissolved only in Me2SO, we prepared water-soluble forms of the peptides by adding two lysine residues at the amino terminus (P4–P6). We also synthesized peptides with mutations in potential CypA-binding sites; peptide P7 had a Pro to Ala substitution in the position corresponding to Pro211 of CD147, whereas in peptide P8 Leu was replaced by Ala, thus disrupting a potential leucine zipper. To analyze binding of peptides to CypA, we used mass spectral analysis. Peptides were incubated with CypA overnight at 4 °C, and unbound peptides were removed by centrifugation through the gel filtration column. Material that passed through the column was analyzed on the Kratos Kompact SEQ machine using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. This analysis demonstrated that peptides P1, P4, and P8 bound CypA, whereas P2, P3, P5, P6, and P7 did not. A typical example of binding and nonbinding interactions is shown in Fig. 5B for peptides 4 and 6, respectively. To compare peptide-CypA binding in a quantitative manner, we relied on HPLC analysis. Peptides were incubated with CypA as described above. The reaction mixture was run through a gel filtration column (to remove the unbound peptide), and CypA and bound peptide were fractionated by HPLC. All peptides used in this study separated well from each other and from CypA by elution time. The quantification of binding interactions is shown in Fig. 5C. The water-soluble forms of the investigated peptides (P4–P6) did not differ from their native analogs in CypA-binding properties. Consistent with results of mass spectrometry analysis, peptide 1 (and its water-soluble form peptide 4), but not peptides 2, 3, 5 or 6, bound CypA. The binding was due mainly to the Pro residue in the peptide sequence (corresponding to Pro211 of CD147), because it was almost completely abolished by a single point mutation Pro → Ala (compare P4 to P7). Disruption of the leucine zipper in P4 by the Leu → Ala point mutation did not reduce CypA binding (compare P8 to P4), indicating that the leucine zipper motif was not involved in this interaction. Because the P211A mutation greatly reduced the interaction between the CD147-derived peptide and cyclophilin A, we tested CD147 surface expression in CHO cells transfected either with wild-type human CD147 with the GFP fused at the C terminus (CD147.wt-GFP) or human CD147.P211A-GFP carrying a proline 211 to alanine substitution. In both CD147.wt-GFP and CD147.P211A-GFP-transfected cultures, ∼35% of the cells expressed GFP. Surface CD147 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with PE-conjugated anti-CD147 antibody and gating on GFP-positive cells. As shown in Fig. 6, surface expression of CD147.P211A was reduced compared with wild-type CD147 (reduction of mean fluorescence from 427.5 to 233.4). If P211 is critical for the cyclophilin-regulated surface expression of CD147, one would expect the cell surface expression of CD147.P211A mutant to be independent of cyclophilin and thus resistant to CsA. Indeed, although the cell surface expression of the CD147.P211A mutant was reduced when compared with the wild-type protein, it was not affected by CsA treatment (Fig. 6), in contrast to the wild-type CD147. The experiments presented in this report demonstrate that the cell surface expression of CD147 correlates with the capacity of its transmembrane domain to interact with cyclophilin. We also identified Pro211 as a critical determinant in this interaction. When CD147-cyclophilin interaction was blocked, either by CsA or by mutating the critical proline 211 residue, transport of CD147 to the cell surface was delayed. This effect is consistent with the proposed role of cyclophilins in assisting transport of the proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (15Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4886-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 19Shiraishi S. Yokoo H. Kobayashi H. Yanagita T. Uezono Y. Minami S. Takasaki M. Wada A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 293: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mutation of Pro211 impaired the binding to cyclophilin (Fig. 5) and the cell surface expression of CD147 (Fig. 6), suggesting that these two effects are related. However, another possibility is that Pro211 mutation reduces CD147 cell surface expression by affecting its conformation and not cyclophilin binding. Two lines of evidence argue against this explanation. First, the effect of Pro211 mutation is very similar in magnitude to the effect of CsA (compare expression of CD147.P211A in untreated cells to CD147.wt expression in CsA-treated cells in Fig. 6), whereas a more dramatic change would be expected to occur if protein conformation were grossly affected. Second, and more important, CsA treatment did not further reduce the cell surface expression of CD147.P211A, indicating that the mutant is not regulated by cyclophilin. It remains possible that conformational change is responsible for impairment of interaction with cyclophilin, and future studies will determine the effect of Pro211 mutation on CD147 conformation. An unusual feature of CD147 is that this protein, which has been shown to function as a receptor for extracellular CypA and CypB (5Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T.

Guo H. Toole B. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 786-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), can interact with cyclophilins as a mature protein expressed on the plasma membrane and as an immature form during its intracellular translocation. The first interaction involves the proline residue located in position 180, in the membrane-proximal region of the CD147 extracellular domain (5Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T. Guo H. Hung H.C. Toole B. Gallay P. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22959-22965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the Pro211-containing region also takes part in this interaction with extracellular cyclophilins. Different computational techniques predict a slightly different position of Pro211 relative to the transmembrane region. According to TMpred (29Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar, 30Ikeda M. Arai M. Lao D.M. Shimizu T. In Silico Biol. 2002; 2: 19-33PubMed Google Scholar), the TM helix is located between residues 212 and 229, thus positioning Pro211 immediately prior to the TM region. Several other techniques predict Pro211 as a part of the TM region as follows: TOPPRED (31Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) (TM between residues 209 and 229), DAS (32Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 673-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (residues 206–228), TMHMM (33Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9158) Google Scholar) (residues 207–229), and PHDhtm (27Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) (residues 209–226). Although in all methods, except TMPred, the helix starts before residue 211, in most cases this proline residue is close to the helix end. The length of the predicted helix is in the range of 18–23 residues. The distance between the ends of such helices is 27–32 Å. Because the effective thickness of phospholipid membranes impenetrable for water is less than 25 Å, Pro211 would be accessible to solvent even if it is not the first residue in the TM helix. Therefore, it is likely that this proline residue is accessible for interaction with cyclophilin in the lumen of the Golgi vesicles. The identity of the cyclophilin responsible for CD147 trafficking remains unknown. It appears unlikely that this cyclophilin is CypA, the most abundant cytoplasmic cyclophilin, as our preliminary experiments failed to identify CypA in CD147 immunoprecipitates. 2V. Yurchenko, T. Pushkarsky, J.-H. Li, W. W. Dai, B. Sherry, and M. Bukrinsky, unpublished results. The intracellular interaction of CD147 with cyclophilin likely occurs during transport of CD147 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Most importantly, Pro180 in CD147 extracellular domain, mutation of which has been shown to impair the receptor function of CD147 (5Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T. Guo H. Hung H.C. Toole B. Gallay P. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22959-22965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), is also accessible at this time and theoretically may interact with cyclophilin. However, this interaction is not involved in the regulation of CD147 intracellular trafficking, as substitution of Pro180 with Ala does not reduce the surface expression of CD147, while eliminating signaling response to extracellular CypA (5Yurchenko V. Zybarth G. O'Connor M. Dai W.W. Franchin G. Hao T. Guo H. Hung H.C. Toole B. Gallay P. Sherry B. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22959-22965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Therefore, Pro211, and not Pro180, seems to define the binding site for the intracellular interaction between CD147 and cyclophilin. Because proline 211 is close to the extracellular domain of CD147, the interacting cyclophilin must be on the luminal side of the Golgi membrane to access this site. This also argues against CypA as a regulator of CD147 expression, despite CypA binding to CD147 in solution; CypA is a cytosolic protein. In summary, our results demonstrate that plasma membrane expression of CD147 is regulated by cyclophilin and identify Pro211 as the critical residue responsible for this regulation. The identity of the cyclophilin involved remains to be determined. We are grateful to S. Zucker (State University of New York, Stony Brook) for the kind gift of the CD147-GFP construct; C.

Aβ is produced when amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by β- and γ-secretases at the N and C termini of the Aβ domain, respectively. The β-secretase is membrane-bound aspartyl protease, most commonly known as BACE1. Because BACE1 cleaves APP at the N terminus of the Aβ domain, it catalyzes the first step in Aβ generation. PAR-4 (prostate apoptosis response-4) is a leucine zipper protein that was initially identified to be associated with neuronal degeneration and aberrant Aβ production in models of AD. We now report that the C-terminal domain of PAR-4 is necessary for forming a complex with the cytosolic tail of BACE1 in co-immunoprecipitation assays and in vitro pull-down experiments. Overexpression of PAR-4 significantly increased, whereas silencing of PAR-4 expression by RNA interference significantly decreased, β-secretase cleavage of APP. These results suggest that PAR-4 may be directly involved in regulating the APP cleavage activity of BACE1. Because the increased BACE1 activity observed in AD patients does not seem to arise from genetic mutations or polymorphisms in BACE1, the identification of PAR-4 as an endogenous regulator of BACE1 activity may have significant implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for AD.

https://openalex.org/W2129786506,"YidC plays a role in the integration and assembly of many (if not all) Escherichia coli inner membrane proteins. Strikingly, YidC operates in two distinct pathways: one associated with the Sec translocon that also mediates protein translocation across the inner membrane and one independent from the Sec translocon. YidC is homologous to Alb3 and Oxa1 that function in the integration of proteins into the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts and inner membrane of mitochondria, respectively. Here, we have expressed the conserved region of yeast Oxa1 in a conditional E. coli yidC mutant. We find that Oxa1 restores growth upon depletion of YidC. Data obtained from in vivo protease protection assays and in vitro cross-linking and folding assays suggest that Oxa1 complements the insertion of Sec-independent proteins but is unable to take over the Sec-associated function of YidC. Together, our data indicate that the Sec-independent function of YidC is conserved and essential for cell growth.

Together, our data indicate that the Sec-independent function of YidC is conserved and essential for cell growth. Membrane proteins destined for the mitochondrial inner membrane, chloroplast thylakoid membrane, or plasma membrane of bacteria are targeted and inserted via distinct and partly conserved pathways (1.Stuart R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2.Kuhn A. Stuart R. Henry R. Dalbey R.E.

In Escherichia coli, two pathways have been identified by which membrane proteins integrate into the inner membrane. One pathway involves both the Sec translocon and YidC (the Sec-YidC pathway), whereas the other only involves YidC (the “YidC-only” pathway) (5.de Gier J.W. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6.Chen M. Xie K. Jiang F. Yi L. Dalbey R.E. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Most inner membrane proteins (IMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: IMP, inner membrane protein; SRP, signal recognition particle; TM, transmembrane segment; HA, hemagglutinin; Lep, leader peptidase; IMV, inner membrane vesicle; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; mAb, monoclonal antibodies; PspA, phage shock protein A. appear to follow the Sec-YidC pathway. Targeting to the Sec translocon is mediated by the signal recognition particle (SRP) that associates with a hydrophobic targeting signal in a nascent IMP near the ribosomal exit site (7.Koch H.G. Moser M. Muller M. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 146: 55-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Luirink J. Sinning I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 17-35PubMed Google Scholar). The nascent IMP is then transferred to the Sec translocon in the inner membrane. The mechanism of targeting and transfer is not fully understood but most likely involves both the SRP receptor FtsY that is in part associated with the inner membrane and the large ribosomal subunit that has affinity for the Sec translocon. The core of the Sec translocon is the heterotrimeric SecYEG complex that functions not only as the insertion site for IMPs but also as the general translocation channel for secretory proteins (9.Mori H. Ito K. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 494-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10.Rapoport T.A. Goder V. Heinrich S.U. Matlack K.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 568-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Translocation of secretory proteins and of large periplasmic domains of IMPs is powered by the cytosolic ATPase SecA that is connected with the Sec translocon during the translocation process. Cross-link and pull-down experiments have identified YidC as another Sec-associated component that interacts with Sec-dependent IMPs during their membrane insertion (11.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 12.Houben E.N.G. Scotti P.A. Valent Q.A. Brunner J. de Gier J.W.L. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The contact with YidC is transient and specific for transmembrane segments (TMs) of substrate IMPs. The function of Sec-associated YidC is enigmatic and may be versatile. Order of interaction studies using nascent IMPs suggest a role for YidC both in the reception and the lateral diffusion of individual TMs from the Sec translocon into the lipid bilayer (13.Houben E.N. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M.

Muller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In support of this proposed function, membrane insertion of subunit a of F1F0-ATPase is affected upon depletion of YidC (17.Yi L. Celebi N. Chen M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39260-39267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Notably, YidC is not per se essential for insertion of all Sec-dependent IMPs, although it may enhance the fidelity and efficiency of this process (15.Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W.L. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 18.van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A recent study indicates that YidC plays an important role in the folding of the Sec-dependent lactose permease (LacY) suggesting a function for YidC as a chaperone or folding catalyst (19.Nagamori S. Smirnova I.N. Kaback H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, YidC is involved in a Sec-independent integration process (20.Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Jiang F.L. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Substrates of this YidC-only pathway include small phage coat proteins and the important endogenous IMP F0c (subunit c of F1F0-ATPase) (reviewed in Ref. 4.Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro reconstitution experiments reveal a direct catalytic but otherwise undefined function of the Sec-independent form of YidC in membrane insertion (18.van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21.Serek J. Bauer-Manz G. Struhalla G. Van Den Berg L. Kiefer D. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, YidC is a member of the Alb3/Oxa1/YidC protein family (1.Stuart R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2.Kuhn A. Stuart R. Henry R. Dalbey R.E.

Alb3 and Oxa1 are involved in insertion of proteins into the chloroplast thylakoid and mitochondrial inner membrane, respectively. Alb3 is required for insertion of subunits of the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein in an apparently Sec-independent process. However, association of Alb3 with SecY has been demonstrated in Arabidopsis thaliana (22.Klostermann E. Droste Gen Helling I. Carde J.P. Schunemann D. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and Alb3 can functionally complement a conditional E. coli yidC mutant in both the Sec-YidC pathway as well as the YidC-only pathway suggesting the involvement of Alb3 in distinct insertion pathways similar to E. coli YidC (23.Jiang F. Yi L. Moore M. Chen M. Rohl T. Van Wijk K.J. De Gier J.W. Henry R. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19281-19288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Oxa1 is the first identified and best studied member of this family (reviewed in Ref. 1.Stuart R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Oxa1 was found to mediate insertion and assembly of various proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane without being absolutely essential for this process. Substrates of Oxa1 include both nuclear and mitochondrially encoded IMPs, most notably subunits of respiratory chain complexes. Cross-linking experiments revealed direct proximity between Oxa1 and its substrates early during their biogenesis and membrane integration as observed for E. coli YidC (24.Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Oxa1 has been purified as a homo-oligomeric, probably tetrameric, complex from Neurospora crassa mitochondria (25.Nargang F.E. Preuss M. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12846-12853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) consistent with the fact that mitochondria do not possess a Sec translocon (26.Glick B.S. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2651-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, it has been postulated that Oxa1 and the Sec-independent form of YidC share structural and functional properties. In the present study, we expressed the conserved region of yeast Oxa1 fused to a non-essential targeting domain of YidC in a conditional E. coli yidC mutant. The hybrid Oxa1 restores growth upon depletion of YidC and complements the insertion of Sec-independent proteins but appears incapable to take over the Sec-associated function of YidC. Thus, the Sec-independent function of YidC appears conserved and essential for cell growth. Reagents and Sera—Restriction enzymes and the Expand Long Template PCR system were obtained from Roche Applied Science. T4 DNA ligase was from Invitrogen. The MEGAshortscript T7 transcription kit was from Ambion Inc. [35S]methionine and protein A-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were supplied by Sigma. Antiserum against the hemagglutinin (HA) tag was purchased from Sigma, and antisera against YidC, leader peptidase (Lep), trigger factor, and OmpA have been described previously (11.Scotti P.A.

Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—E. coli strain Top10F′ (Invitrogen) was used for cloning and maintenance of plasmid constructs. Strain MRE600 was used to prepare translation lysate for suppression of TAG stop codons in the presence of l-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-diazirin-3H-yl] phenylalanine ((Tmd)Phe)-tRNAsup (11.Scotti P.A.

Strain MC4100 was used to obtain inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) (prepared as described in Ref. 28.de Vrije T. Tommassen J. De Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The YidC depletion strain JS7131 (20.Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Jiang F.L. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) was used for the preparation of IMVs and for in vivo protease accessibility experiments. The temperature-sensitive amber suppressor YidC depletion strain KO1672 and its isogenic parent strain KO1670 (29.Froderberg L. Houben E.N. Baars L. Luirink J. De Gier J.W. J. Biol.

All strains were routinely grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium with appropriate antibiotics. Plasmids pC4Meth108FtsQTAG40, pC4Meth50LepTAG10, and pC4Meth50LepTAG15 have been described before (11.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.

Plasmid pEH1-ecOxa1His harbors the ecOxa1 fusion construct with a N-terminal hexahistidinyl tag under control of a lac promoter. For construction of this plasmid, the sequence encoding residues 2–247 of YidC was amplified by PCR from DNA isolated from E. coli DH5α. Codons for one methionine, one alanine, and six histidine residues were introduced via the 5′ primer directly upstream of the YidC sequence. The PCR product was cleaved by NcoI and KpnI and cloned into the expression plasmid pEH1 (30.Hashemzadeh-Bonehi L. Mehraein-Ghomi F. Mitsopoulos C. Jacob J.P. Hennessey E.S. Broome-Smith J.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 676-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sequence encoding residues 43–402 of Oxa1 was amplified from genomic yeast DNA using an upstream primer that introduced a short linker containing a tobacco etch virus cleavage site. The resulting PCR product was digested with KpnI and SmaI and also cloned into the pEH1 plasmid, giving rise to plasmid pEH1-ecOxa1His. For complementation studies, a low copy ecOxa1 plasmid was constructed as follows. The EcoRV/AgeI fragment of pEH1-ecOxa1His was replaced by the corresponding fragment of pEH1-YidCX (lab collection), thereby removing the hexahistidinyl tag and introducing an XbaI site upstream of the YidC coding region. The hybrid construct lacking the tag was cloned XbaI/SmaI into pUC19, yielding pUC19-ecOxa1. Subsequently, the ecOxa1 coding sequence was cloned XbaI/SacI into the low copy expression plasmid pCL1921.Km, yielding pCL-ecOxa1. pCL1921.Km is a derivative of pCL1921 (31.Lerner C.G. Inouye M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) containing the HincII fragment of pUC4K harboring the kanamycin resistance gene cloned into the NaeI site in the streptomycin resistance gene. ecOxa1 expression plasmids were introduced into strain JS7131, KO1672, and KO1670 together with a compatible LacIq plasmid (when indicated) to suppress uninduced expression of the ecOxa1 construct. For in vivo protease accessibility experiments, the previously described pASKIBA3-M13P2 and pBAD24-F0cHA were used (27.van Bloois E. Jan Haan G. de Gier J.W. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In Vivo Protease K Accessibility Assay—Strain JS7131 harboring pCL-ecOxa1 together with pASKIBA3-M13P2 was essentially grown as described (20.Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Jiang F.L. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown overnight in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% l-arabinose. The overnight culture was diluted 1:50 in fresh LB supplemented with 0.2% l-arabinose to express YidC. To deplete cells for YidC, l-arabinose was omitted from the medium, and for the expression of the ecOxa1 construct IPTG was added to the medium as indicated. Cells were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and resuspended in M9 minimal medium. Expression of M13P2 was induced for 10 min by adding anhydrotetracycline (500 ng/ml). Subsequently, the cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (30 μCi/ml), converted to spheroplasts and processed as described previously (32.Froderberg L. Houben E. Samuelson J.C. Chen M.

Briefly, both strains were grown overnight at 30 °C in LB medium. The overnight culture was diluted 1:50 into fresh LB. To deplete KO1672 for YidC, cells were grown at 42 °C, and for the expression of the ecOxa1 construct IPTG was added to the medium as indicated. Cells were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and resuspended in M9 minimal medium. Expression of F0cHA was induced for 10 min by adding l-arabinose (0.2%). Subsequently, the cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (30 μCi/ml), converted to spheroplasts, and processed as described previously (32.Froderberg L. Houben E. Samuelson J.C. Chen M.

Folding of in Vitro Synthesized lacY—In vitro transcription/translation/insertion was performed at 30 °C for 15 min, and IMVs containing in vitro synthesized LacY were collected onto 50% sucrose and washed with urea as described (33.Nagamori S.

After in vitro transcription/translation/insertion of LacY, IMVs were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and incubated with purified monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (25 μg/ml) as specified in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 2% dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside for 6 h at 4 °C. Before the addition of mAb, 5% of each reaction mixture was saved for quantification of LacY (see Fig. 8, Insertion). Supernatants obtained by ultracentrifugation were treated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous rotation.

E. coli YidC has an additional TMs upstream from this core followed by a large periplasmic domain. The organellar Alb3 and Oxa have extended C-terminal domains downstream of the last TMs. Alb3 and Oxa are initially synthesized with an N-terminal targeting signal that is cleaved from the mature protein. To study the function of Oxa1 in E. coli, a chimeric protein was constructed consisting of the first 247 amino acids of YidC fused to residues 43–402 of Oxa1 separated by a linker sequence at the fusion point (Fig. 1B). The fused N-terminal region of YidC comprises the first TMs and part of the periplasmic loop (Fig. 1A). The first TMs has been shown to function in the targeting of YidC to the inner membrane (34.Urbanus M.L. Froderberg L. Drew D. Bjork P. de Gier J.W.L. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol.

The periplasmic region downstream of the first TMs is neither conserved nor essential for YidC functioning per se (23.Jiang F. Yi L. Moore M. Chen M. Rohl T. Van Wijk K.J. De Gier J.W. Henry R.

The hybrid construct was named ecOxa1 for E. coli-targeted Oxa1 and was cloned under lac promoter control in the medium and low copy expression plasmids pEH1 and a pCL1921 derivative, respectively (30.Hashemzadeh-Bonehi L. Mehraein-Ghomi F. Mitsopoulos C. Jacob J.P. Hennessey E.S. Broome-Smith J.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 676-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31.Lerner C.G. Inouye M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The plasmids were introduced into strain JS7131 that depends on arabinose for YidC expression, and hence for growth. To minimize uninduced expression of the ecOxa1 construct in pCL1921.Km, a compatible lacIq plasmid (pEH3) was used. Complementation of the growth defect upon depletion of YidC was assayed by monitoring growth on solid medium in the absence of arabinose. As a control, JS7131 cells containing wild type yidC in the low copy vector pCL1921.Km (see “Experimental Procedures”) grew only when IPTG was present in the medium to induce YidC expression thus validating our assay conditions (Fig. 2A, compare panels 1 and 3). The ecOxa1 construct expressed from the same low copy expression vector could not complement depletion of YidC under these conditions (data not shown). However, induced expression of the hybrid from the medium copy vector pEH1 did restore growth of JS7131 in the absence of arabinose (Fig. 2B, compare panels 1 and 3) indicating that Oxa1 can complement depletion of YidC. To examine whether the plasmid-dependent complementation is related to a difference in expression levels, strain JS7131 harboring the various constructs was grown in liquid LB in the presence of IPTG or arabinose and analyzed by immunoblotting for ecOxa1 content (Fig. 3). The plasmids that were shown to complement the yidC conditional strain in Fig. 2 expressed comparable levels of YidC and ecOxa1 (IPTG-induced expression of pCL-YidC in the presence of pEH3 (lane 5) versus pEH1-ecOxa1 alone (lane 6)). Expression of ecOxa1 from the low copy plasmid pCL1921.Km could be enhanced to almost identical levels by using a higher concentration of IPTG (lane 7). Under the latter conditions, the growth defect upon depletion of YidC was restored but only on minimal medium plates (data not shown). Notably, under these conditions expression of ecOxa1 is higher than the arabinose-induced expression of YidC from the chromosomal yidC gene (lane 2) that yet fully supports cell growth in any tested medium. The difference in expression levels between wild type YidC and ecOxa1 was already observed in cells grown in the presence of arabinose but in the absence of IPTG. pEH1-YidC showed much stronger background expression than pEH1-ecOxa1 indicating a relatively low expression of the ecOxa1 construct (compare lanes 1 and 3) possibly caused by inefficient codon usage. Together, the data indicate a concentration-dependent complementation by the ecOxa1 construct of the growth defect in strain JS7131 caused by depletion of YidC. ecOxa1 Is Localized in the Inner Membrane and Complements the Phage Shock Protein A (PspA) Response—To verify that ecOxa1 is correctly localized in the E. coli inner membrane, IMVs were gradient-purified from JS7131 cells expressing ecOxa1. As expected (23.Jiang F. Yi L. Moore M. Chen M. Rohl T. Van Wijk K.J. De Gier J.W. Henry R. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol.

We have shown that IMVs devoid of YidC contain massive amounts of PspA (Ref. 37.van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar; Fig. 4, compare lanes 2 and 4). PspA is a stress protein that responds to dissipation of the proton motive force, a consequence of YidC depletion caused by defects in the functional assembly of cytochrome o oxidase and the F1F0-ATPase complex (Ref. 37.van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and references therein). As shown in Fig. 4, the PspA response upon depletion of YidC is almost completely prevented by simultaneous expression of ecOxa1. This suggests that cells expressing ecOxa1 are able to sustain the proton motive force and that ecOxa1 complements the assembly of respiratory membrane complexes in E. coli. ecOxa1 Can Fulfill the Sec-independent Membrane Integration Function of YidC—A subset of IMPs in E. coli integrates into the membrane via a Sec-independent mechanism that probably only involves YidC. To investigate whether ecOxa1 can replace YidC and facilitate the membrane integration of Sec-independent IMPs, we tested insertion and translocation of M13P2. M13P2 is an M13 procoat derivative extended at its C terminus with the P2 domain of Lep. M13P2 is synthesized with a signal sequence that is processed by Lep, resulting in mature M13P2 (Fig. 5A). Processing and membrane integration of M13P2 is, like wild type M13 procoat, strongly affected by"

In the STOP-NIDDM study, even patients without overt diabetes, but with impaired glucose tolerance, had a reduction in cardiovascular events when treated with acarbose. Therefore, we investigated the effect of repetitive postprandial hyperglycemia on the cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. Mice were treated daily by single applications of placebo, sucrose (4 g/kg body weight), or sucrose + acarbose (10 mg/kg body weight) by gavage for 7 days. Acarbose treatment significantly reduced the sucrose-induced increase in plasma glucose concentration. Subsequently, animals underwent 30 min of ischemia by coronary artery ligation and 24 h of reperfusion in vivo. In the sucrose group, ischemia/reperfusion damage was significantly increased (infarct/area at risk, placebo vs. sucrose, 38.8+/-7.5% vs. 62.2+/-4.8%, P<0.05). This was prevented by acarbose treatment (infarct/area at risk 30.7+/-7.2%). While myocardial inflammation was similar in all groups, oxidative stress as indicated by a significant increase in lipid peroxides was enhanced in the sucrose, but not in the sucrose + acarbose group. In summary, repetitive postprandial hyperglycemia increases ischemia/reperfusion damage. This effect can be prevented by treatment with the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose."

In previous studies, we found that PrP molecules carrying mutations in the N-terminal signal peptide (L9R) and the transmembrane domain (3AV) were synthesized exclusively in the CtmPrP form in transfected cell lines. To characterize the properties of CtmPrP in a neuronal setting, we have utilized cerebellar granule neurons cultured from Tg(L9R–3AV) mice that developed a fatal neurodegenerative illness. We found that about half of the L9R-3AV PrP synthesized in these neurons represents CtmPrP, with the rest being SecPrP, the glycolipid anchored form that does not span the membrane. Both forms contained an uncleaved signal peptide, and they are differentially glycosylated. SecPrP was localized on the surface of neuronal processes. Most surprisingly, CtmPrP was concentrated in the Golgi apparatus, rather in the endoplasmic reticulum as it is in transfected cell lines.

Prion diseases are fatal neurological disorders of humans and animals characterized by ataxia and neuronal degeneration (1Prusiner S.B. Prion Biology and Diseases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004Google Scholar). Unlike other neurodegenerative diseases, they can have an infectious as well as a sporadic or familial origin. Most cases are associated with the presence of PrPSc, 1The abbreviations used are: PrPSc, scrapie isoform of prion protein; endo H, endoglycosidase H; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PIPLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; PK, proteinase K; PrP, prion protein; PrPC, cellular isoform of PrP; WT, wild type; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BHK, baby hamster kidney; Tg, transgene; PNGase, peptide:N-glycosidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase. a conformationally altered isoform of PrPC, a cell surface glycoprotein of uncertain function that is expressed primarily in neurons of the brain and spinal cord. PrPC is monomeric, protease-sensitive, and rich in α-helical structure. In contrast, PrPSc is aggregated, protease-resistant, and rich in β-sheets. There is considerable evidence that PrPSc is an infectious protein and that conversion of PrPC into PrPSc is the central event in the propagation of prions, the infectious agents in these diseases (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar, 3Weissmann C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that PrPSc accumulates in the brain during most prion diseases, there is uncertainty about the mechanisms responsible for neuronal death. Several lines of evidence suggest that PrPSc is not toxic when it is presented to neurons externally (4Brandner S. Isenmann S. Raeber A. Fischer M. Sailer A. Kobayashi Y. Marino S. Weissmann C.

Science. 2003; 302: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) and that conversion of PrPC to PrPSc within neurons may generate toxic intermediates or by-products. However, there is debate about the identity of these neurotoxic species (6Chiesa R. Harris D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 743-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Several alternative forms of PrP, distinct from both PrPC and PrPSc, have been proposed as key pathogenic entities based on experiments in cell culture and transgenic mice. These include transmembrane PrP (7Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R.

PrP is unusual because it can exist in several different topological forms that are generated during synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Most molecules assume the form designated SecPrP, in which the polypeptide chain has been fully translocated into the ER lumen with its C terminus attached to the lipid bilayer by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (12Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 13Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5405-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Under certain circumstances, however, the protein can adopt either of two opposite transmembrane orientations (designated CtmPrP and NtmPrP) in which a highly conserved stretch of hydrophobic amino acids in the middle of the sequence integrates into the membrane (7Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 14Hölscher C. Bach U.C.

Mutations within and adjacent to the transmembrane domain that enhance its hydrophobicity increase the proportion of CtmPrP (from <10% to 20–30% of the total PrP) (7Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 8Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D.

Some of these mutations (A117V and P105L) are associated with familial prion diseases, whereas others (3AV) are not seen in human patients. Because the brains of patients with the A117V mutation do not contain conventional PrP27–30 (the protease-resistant core of PrPSc) (18Tateishi J. Kitamoto T. Doh-ura K. Sakaki Y. Steinmetz G. Tranchant C. Warter J.M. Heldt N. Neurology. 1990; 40: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was proposed that CtmPrP, rather than PrPSc, is the proximal cause of neurodegeneration in this these and possibly other cases of prion disease (7Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 8Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, transgenic mice expressing PrP with CtmPrP-favoring mutations develop a spontaneous neurodegenerative illness that is similar to scrapie, but without detectable PrPSc (7Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. Defea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Based on these and other results, it was suggested that CtmPrP is a key neurotoxic intermediate in both familial and infectious prion diseases and that the amount of this form can be increased directly by pathogenic mutations, or indirectly by accumulation of PrPSc (8Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, uncertainties remain about the role of CtmPrP in prion diseases because of recent reports that CtmPrP levels do not change significantly during scrapie infection (19Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45960-45968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or as a result of most pathogenic mutations (17Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2212-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has been interested in investigating further the role of CtmPrP in prion diseases. To this end, we have identified mutations that cause PrP to be synthesized exclusively with the CtmPrP topology, thus facilitating analysis of this form in the absence of the other topological variants. We demonstrated that CtmPrP has an uncleaved, N-terminal signal peptide (16Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and that substitution of charged residues in the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence strongly favors synthesis of CtmPrP (19Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45960-45968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Combining one of these mutations (L9R) with a previously studied mutation in the transmembrane domain (3AV) resulted in a protein that was expressed entirely as CtmPrP after in vitro translation and transfection of cultured cells (16Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The presence of the L9R-3AV mutation caused a striking change in the subcellular distribution of PrP; the protein was no longer present on the plasma membrane like wild-type PrP but was instead concentrated in the ER of transfected CHO, BHK, and N2a cells (16Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This result raised the possibility that the ER could be a potential site for the neurotoxic action of CtmPrP. To extend our studies to an in vivo setting, we have recently created transgenic mice expressing L9R-3AV PrP. 2Stewart, R. S., Piccardo, P., Ghetti, B., and Harris, D. A. (2005) J. Neurosci., in press. We found that these mice develop a fatal, ataxic neurological disorder accompanied by extensive degeneration of cerebellar granule neurons and hippocampal pyramidal cells. To our surprise, we found that this phenotype was strongly dependent on coexpression of endogenous, wild-type PrP. Here we have taken advantage of the availability of Tg(L9R-3AV) mice to study the cell biology and metabolism of CtmPrP in neurons. We find that, in contrast to transfected cell lines, cultured neurons expressing transgenically encoded L9R-3AV localize CtmPrP to the Golgi apparatus rather than to the ER. This observation dramatically changes our view of the possible cellular pathways that may be responsible for CtmPrP-induced neurotoxicity. Transgenic Mice—Engineering of Tg(L9R-3AV) mice is described elsewhere.2 The experiments reported here were carried out using mice from the B line, but similar results were obtained using mice from the C line (data not shown). Mice were hemizygous for the transgene array, and were maintained on both Prn-p+/+ and Prn-p0/0 backgrounds. Tg(WT-E1)/Prn-p0/0 and Tg(PG14-A2)/Prn-p0/0 mice have been described previously (20Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Harris D.A.

Cells were used after 4–5 days in culture. Based on staining with cell type-specific marker proteins, these cultures typically contained >95% granule neurons, with the remainder of cells being fibroblasts and astrocytes.

To treat PrP with glycosidases, protein was eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7). The eluate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with endo H, neuraminidase, or PNGase F (all from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Immunoprecipitated PrP was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. PrP Membrane Topology Assay—Cerebellar granule cells were metabolically labeled for 4–6 h as described above. Cells were then scraped into PBS, spun at 2,000 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). Cells were lysed by 12 passages through silastic tubing (0.3-mm inner diameter) connecting two syringes with 27-gauge needles, and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots of the postnuclear supernatant were diluted into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 250 μg/ml PK in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100. Digestion was terminated by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 mm final concentration), and PrP was then immunoprecipitated and deglycosylated by treatment with PNGase F. Western Blotting—Brain tissue was homogenized using a Teflon pestle in 10 volumes of PBS containing protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml; leupeptin and pepstatin, 10 μg/ml). Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min. Cultured neurons were lysed in 0.5% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and the lysates were heated at 95 °C for 10 min. Protein was quantified using a BCA Assay (Pierce). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-PrP antibodies. In some cases, samples were treated with endo H or PNGase F, and proteins were recovered by methanol precipitation prior to SDS-PAGE. Immunocytochemistry—Cerebellar granules cells were grown in 8-well chamber slides. For surface staining, cells were transferred to B27 medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing B27 vitamin supplement) and stained with anti-PrP antibodies (1:500 dilution) for 10 min at 37 °C. After rinsing in PBS, cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde, 5% sucrose in PBS, blocked for 10 min in PBS, 2% goat serum, and stained with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were mounted in 50% glycerol/PBS. In some cases, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with PIPLC (1 unit/ml) in B27 medium prior to fixation. For visualization of intracellular PrP, cells were first fixed for 10 min at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde, 5% sucrose in PBS and were then incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, either in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (to permeabilize all membranes) or in 10 μg/ml digitonin in digitonin buffer (10% sucrose, 100 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.0) (to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane) (26Otto J.C.

After treatment with blocking solution, cells were stained with antibodies against PrP, giantin (Covance, Berkeley, CA), or PDI (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Cells were then incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG). In some experiments, cells were treated for 4 h with 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma) prior to staining. Cells were viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with an Axiovert 200 laser scanning system. The L9R-3AV mutation is illustrated in Fig. 1. We have generated and characterized two lines of transgenic mice that express PrP carrying this mutation.2 These Tg(L9R-3AV) mice develop a spontaneous neurological disorder characterized by ataxia and by loss of cerebellar granule cells and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We utilized primary cultures of granule cells prepared from the cerebella of Tg(L9R-3AV) mice at postnatal day 5 to characterize the cell biology and metabolism of the mutant PrP in a neuronal setting. Cultured Neurons from Tg(L9R-3AV) Mice Produce BothCtmPrP and SecPrP—We first used a protease protection assay to analyze the topology of L9R-3AV PrP in microsomes from granule neurons. Microsomes in a postnuclear supernatant prepared from [35S]methionine-labeled neurons were subjected to digestion with proteinase K (PK), and PrP was then immunoprecipitated with 3F4 antibody after enzymatic deglycosylation (Fig. 2). We observed the following two protease-protected forms of PrP in approximately equal amounts (Fig. 2, lane 6): a 27-kDa band representing SecPrP molecules that were fully protected from digestion because of their localization in the microsome lumen, and a 19-kDa fragment representing the luminal and transmembrane domains of CtmPrP with the exposed cytoplasmic domain removed. We did not detect a 15-kDa fragment indicative of NtmPrP. As expected, inclusion of Triton X-100 during protease treatment in order to disrupt microsomal membranes resulted in complete digestion of PrP (Fig. 2, lane 7). When the same analysis was carried out on microsomes from Tg(WT) neurons, only a fully protected 25-kDa band corresponding to SecPrP was observed (Fig. 2, lane 2). Thus, granule neurons produce approximately equal proportions of SecPrP and CtmPrP from PrP carrying the L9R-3AV mutation. For both wild-type and mutant proteins, there was a decrease in the total amount of protected PrP after PK treatment, an effect that we attribute to the presence of some inside-out and damaged microsomes and not to the presence of cytoplasmic PrP. Biosynthesis and Turnover of Mutant PrP—We used pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine to analyze the biosynthetic maturation and degradation of L9R-3AV PrP in cerebellar granule neurons (Fig. 3A). A portion of each cell lysate was incubated with endoglycosidase H (endo H) prior to immunoprecipitation of PrP in order to test whether the N-linked glycans had matured to an endo H-resistant state, a step that occurs as proteins transit the mid-Golgi apparatus. At the end of the 20-min pulse-labeling period, a single species of PrP with a molecular mass of 32 kDa was observed. This form was shifted to 27 kDa, the size of unglycosylated PrP, by treatment with endo H, indicating the presence of immature glycan chains. The 32-kDa species was converted into two glycoforms of 32 and 35 kDa over the next 20 min of chase. Both of these mature forms contained glycans that were endo H-resistant. The 32- and 35-kDa glycoforms both decayed with a half-life of ∼2.5 h, similar to the half-life of wild-type PrP in granule neurons (25Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These data suggest the existence of a single metabolic pool of L9R-3AV PrP in neurons, implying that the CtmPrP and SecPrP in these cells do not have markedly different kinetic properties. For comparison, we also analyzed the biosynthesis of L9R-3AV PrP in transiently transfected CHO cells (Fig. 3B). In CHO cells, the mutant protein was initially synthesized as two species of 32 and 27 kDa. The 27-kDa form was not glycosylated, and the 32-kDa form was core-glycosylated, because it is sensitive to endo H. However, the 32-kDa form in CHO cells remained endo H-sensitive throughout the entire chase period, unlike the case for the glycosylated forms of L9R-3AV in granule neurons. These results indicate that, whereas the mutant protein is retained in a pre-Golgi compartment in CHO cells, it transits beyond the mid-Golgi in granule neurons. Despite these differences in glycosylation and cellular trafficking, L9R-3AV PrP in CHO cells decayed with a half-life (∼2.5 h) that was similar to the one observed for this mutant in neurons (see above) and for wild-type PrP in CHO cells (25Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21732-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). L9R-3AV PrP Retains an Uncleaved Signal Peptide—We demonstrated previously that CtmPrP synthesized by in vitro translation or by expression in CHO cells contains an uncleaved N-terminal signal peptide (16Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine whether L9R-3AV PrP in cerebellar granule neurons also has the same feature, we immunoprecipitated PrP from [35S]methionine-labeled cultures using anti-SP, an antibody that specifically recognizes PrP molecules containing an intact signal peptide (19Stewart R.S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45960-45968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Parallel samples were immunoprecipitated with 3F4 or 8H4 antibodies, which recognize PrP molecules regardless of the presence of the signal peptide (see Fig. 1 for the location of antibody epitopes). As an additional way of discriminating molecules with and without the signal peptide, proteins were enzymatically deglycosylated to permit detection of the small size difference between the two species (27 and 25 kDa for signal peptide bearing, and signal peptide-cleaved forms, respectively). When cultures from Tg(L9R-3AV)/Prn-p+/+ mice were analyzed, two bands (25 and 27 kDa) of approximately equal intensity could be resolved after immunoprecipitation with 8H4 antibody (Fig. 4, lane 1). However, only the larger band was recognized by 3F4 and anti-SP antibodies (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). This result demonstrates that the 27-kDa form represents transgenically encoded PrP that contains the 3F4 epitope and has an intact signal peptide, whereas the 25-kDa form represents endogenous mouse PrP that lacks the 3F4 epitope and has a cleaved signal peptide. Because >90% of the PrP recognized by 3F4 migrated at 27 kDa (lane 2), we infer that the majority of the L9R-3AV PrP in granule neurons, comprising both SecPrP and CtmPrP, retained an intact signal peptide. This conclusion was confirmed when we analyzed neurons from Tg(L9R-3AV)/Prn-p0/0 mice. In this case, ∼90% of the PrP immunoprecipitated by 3F4 migrated at 27 kDa, with the rest migrating at 25 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 5). A similar ratio of the two forms was observed with 8H4, the expected result because the neurons contain no endogenous PrP that would be recognized by this antibody (Fig. 4, lane 4). Again, only the 27-kDa form was immunoprecipitated by anti-SP (Fig. 4, lane 6). The amount of 25-kDa PrP in Tg(L9R-3AV) neurons varied somewhat in different experiments, possibly due to artifactual proteolysis after cell lysis, but it never exceeded ∼20% of the total. As anticipated, Tg(WT) neurons produced only a 25-kDa form of PrP that was immunoprecipitated by 8H4 and 3F4 but not by anti-SP (Fig. 4, lanes 7–9). Further evidence that SecPrP contains an uncleaved signal peptide was provided by immunoprecipitation of PrP from PK-treated microsomes using anti-SP antibody (Fig. 2). The fully protected 27-kDa species in Tg(L9R-3AV) neurons reacted with anti-SP (Fig. 2, lane 8), whereas the corresponding 25-kDa band from Tg(WT) neurons did not (lane 4), implying that SecPrP in the former cells contains an uncleaved signal peptide. As expected, the 19-kDa CtmPrP fragment in Tg(L9R-3AV) neurons was not recognized by anti-SP (compare Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 8), because the N terminus of CtmPrP lies on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, and so its uncleaved signal peptide would be accessible to protease digestion. SecPrP but Not CtmPrP Is Present on the Neuronal Surface—In a previous study, we found by immunofluorescence staining that L9R-3AV PrP was absent from the surface of transfected CHO and BHK cells and was completely retained in the ER (16Stewart R.S. Drisaldi B. Harris D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This result was in accord with the observed endo H sensitivity of the protein in these cells. Our observation (Fig. 3) that L9R-3AV PrP in granule neurons matures to an endo H-resistant form suggested that localization of the mutant protein in these cells was likely to be different from CHO and BHK cells. We therefore analyzed the distribution of L9R-3AV PrP in granule neurons by using immunofluorescence microscopy. In our first set of experiments, neurons from Tg(L9R-3AV)/Prn-p0/0 mice were stained in the living state without permeabilization to selectively recognize PrP on the cell surface. As shown in Fig. 5, A–C, we observed positive staining with antibodies directed against three different epitopes distributed along the length of the PrP molecule (Fig. 1), including 8B4 (residues 34–52), 3F4 (residues 108–111), and 8H4 (residues 147–200). Staining was distributed along neuronal processes, which formed an extensive network throughout the culture. Because the epitopes for antibodies 8B4 and 3F4 are extracellular in SecPrP but not in CtmPrP, the accessibility of these epitopes to externally applied antibodies implied that at least some of the L9R-3AV PrP on the surface of the neurons must be in the SecPrP form. Control experiments demonstrated that endogenous, wild-type PrP on neurons from Prn-p+/0 mice stained with 8B4 and 8H4, but not with 3F4 (because e"

However, the downstream target genes regulated by RelA-NF-κB in the initiation of proapoptotic signaling were not identified. We previously showed that RelA-NF-κB functioned as a proapoptotic factor by activating the p53-signaling pathway in response to doxycycline-induced superoxide. In the present study, we demonstrate that the ability of doxycycline/superoxide to induce expression of polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3) depends on NF-κB activity. We identified a κB binding site in the promoter of Plk3, and this κB site is directly involved in its induction by the RelA-NF-κB complex. Plk3 formed a complex with p53 and was involved in the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20 in response to superoxide. Inhibition of Plk3 expression by Plk3 small interfering RNA suppressed the doxycycline/superoxide-mediated apoptosis. Overexpression of wild-type Plk3 in HCT116 p53+/+ cells induced rapid apoptosis, whereas overexpression of wild-type Plk3 in HCT116 p53–/– cells and the kinase-defective mutant Plk3K91R in p53+/+ cells induced delayed onset of apoptosis. Furthermore, mutagenesis of Plk3 showed that the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–26) is essential for the induction of delay onset of apoptosis. These data show that Plk3 is a RelA-NF-κB-regulated gene that induces apoptosis in both p53-dependent and -independent signaling pathways, suggesting a possible mechanism for RelA-NF-κB-regulated proapoptotic responses.

Many studies have shown that proapoptotic signals can induce NF-κB, which in turn induces the expression of the genes involved in suppressing apoptotic signals (4Karin M. Lin A. Nat.

Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). However, a proapoptotic aspect of RelA activity has also been reported; recently, NF-κB was shown to induce cell death after after the engagement of T-cell receptor or exposure to DNA-damaging agents (7Kasibhatla S.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 3469-3473PubMed Google Scholar). Other reports have shown that NF-κB activation is required for the onset of apoptosis induced by alphavirus or kainic acid (10Lin K.I.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The opposing roles of NF-κB in regulating apoptosis have also been shown within individual cells. For example, in the same cells in which inhibition of NF-κB promotes the induction of apoptosis by glucocorticoids, NF-κB is required for the induction of apoptosis by stimulation of phorbol ester and ionomycin for mimicking T-cell activation (12Lin B. Williams-Skipp C. Tao Y. Schleicher M.S. Cano L.L. Duke R.C. Scheinman R.I. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that whether the function of NF-κB is proapoptotic or antiapoptotic in a given cell depends on the cell type, extent of NF-κB activation, and nature of the apoptotic signals. Doxycycline, like chemotherapeutic agents, radiation, cytokines, and other apoptosis inducers, causes structural and morphologic damage to the cell, such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation (13Wyllie A.H.

Our previous report showed that doxycycline induces superoxide formation, suggesting that decreased synthesis of mitochondrial protein disrupts electron transport function and results in electron leakage from the respiratory chain to O2, thus elevating levels of superoxide radicals (18Fujioka S.

However, the molecular mechanism by which doxycycline induces apoptosis is not yet completely understood. Both NF-κB and p53 are activated in response to many stimuli, including DNA damage and oxidative stress (19Sionov R.V. Haupt Y.

Phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 and Ser-20 plays an important role in the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway (22Unger T. Sionov R.V. Moallem E. Yee C.L. Howley P.M. Oren M. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3205-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Our previous report showed that NF-κB-dependent phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20 is an important event in initiating doxycycline-induced apoptosis (18Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Sclabas G.M. Li Z. Pelicano H. Peng B. Yao A. Niu J. Zhang W. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Huang P. Chiao P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27549-27559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the proapoptotic downstream target genes induced by NF-κB have not been identified. We hypothesized that one of the NF-κB-regulated genes that encode the key proteins involved in the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20 initiates apoptosis in response to an increased level of superoxide. In this report, we show that the expression of Plk3 is induced by doxycycline and that this induction depends on the activation of NF-κB. Plk3 is involved in the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20 in response to doxycycline stimulation. Overexpression of wild-type Plk3, but not the N terminus-truncated Plk3 (Δ1–141), induced rapid apoptosis in p53+/+ cells, whereas apoptosis was delayed in p53–/– cells expressing wild-type Plk3 and in p53+/+ cells expressing the kinase-defective mutant Plk3K91R. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of Plk3 expression suggests that Plk3 is essential for superoxide-induced cell death, and deletion analysis of Plk3 showed that the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–26) is essential for induction of delayed onset of apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that Plk3 is an NF-κB-regulated kinase that mediates p53-dependent and -independent proapoptotic response in reaction to elevated levels of superoxide.

The following 32P-end-labeled DNA probes were used: HIVκB, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; Plk3 WT κB, 5′-CCTGAGGTTGGGAGTTCCAGACCAG-3′; Plk3 mutant κB, 5′-CCTGAGGTTAAAAGTTCCAGACCAG-3′; and Oct-1, 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′, for monitoring equal loading of nuclear extracts. Northern Blot Analysis and RT-PCR—RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis were performed as previously described (30Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled human Plk3 cDNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes. RT-PCR analysis was performed with 28 PCR cycles using a pair of Plk3 primers (5′-CCTGCCGCCGGTTTCCTG-3′ and 5′-AGCCTCAGGGCTTGGGTC-3′) and separated on a 1% agarose gel. Western Blot Analysis—Isolation of protein extracts and Western blot analysis was performed as previously described using affinity-purified antibodies against p53, Ser-20-phosphorylated p53, Plk3, FLAG (M2), and β-actin with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) or rabbit anti-goat IgG (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) antibodies (18Fujioka S.

The Lumi-Light Western blot substrate (Roche Applied Science) was used for detection. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—The Plk3 promoter firefly- and TK-Renilla-luciferase reporter gene plasmids were transfected into the HEK293, MDAPanc28, and MDAPanc-28/IκBαM and WT and RelA-null MEF cell lines by Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) or HCT116 and HCT116p53–/– cells with the Lipofectamine methods (Invitrogen) as previously described (26Bunz F.

The activity of both the firefly and the Renilla luciferase, without or with stimulation with doxycycline (50 μg/ml), was determined at 24 and 48 h; the experiments were performed in triplicate. The firefly luciferase activities were normalized to the activity of the Renilla luciferase, which served as an internal control. siRNA Assay—The Plk3 siRNA SMARTpool and nonspecific pooled control (Dharmacon) were transfected into the indicated cells using TransIT-TKO transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after siRNA transfection, cells were treated with 50 μg/ml doxycycline for the indicated times and subjected to subsequent analyses. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assay—The protein extracts (1 mg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 200 ng of anti-FLAG (M2) antibody linked to agarose beads at 4 °C overnight, followed by Western blotting with anti-p53 and anti-Ser-20-phosphorylated p53 antibodies. For the kinase assay, the anti-FLAG (M2) immunoprecipitates were incubated with purified p53 protein (1–342 aa) in 20 μl of kinase buffer as previously described (27Schmidt C. Peng B. Li Z.

DNA Fragmentation—The level of DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells was determined by gel electrophoresis. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with DNA fragment isolation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) for 30 min on ice. The extracts were centrifuged to remove the cell debris, and the low molecular weight DNA fragments were extracted from the supernatant with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with an equal volume of 2-propanol. The DNA pellets were washed with 75% ethanol, resuspended in TE buffer, and analyzed by separation on a 1.5% agarose gel. Immunocytochemistry and Fluorescence Microscopy—HEK293 cells were seeded onto coverslips and transfected with EGFP-PLK3 or -PLK3ΔN fusion construct or control vector using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours posttransfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline followed by treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Immunostaining of γ-tubulin was performed using a Cy3-conjugate anti-γ-tubulin antibody (Sigma). The coverslips were mounted with the aqueous mounting medium ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The images were captured on the Metamorph imaging system (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Colony Formation Assay—Vector control plasmid and wild-type and mutated Plk3 expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells by Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science), or HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116p53–/– cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After a 24-h transfection, cells were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 for colony formation. Colonies were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. The number of colonies was directly counted. Alternatively, stained colonies were lysed with 1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline. Colony lysates were diluted in 0.1% SDS, and the A615 value was measured. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed with a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) as previously described (18Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Sclabas G.M. Li Z. Pelicano H. Peng B. Yao A. Niu J. Zhang W. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Huang P. Chiao P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27549-27559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Two PCR primers, 5′-TGCAATTCCCAGCCAGGCAAG-3′ and 5′-TGCAATTCCCAGCCAGGCAAG-3′, were used to amplify a 176-bp fragment, which corresponded to the predicted NF-κB enhancer region in the Plk3 promoter. Doxycycline-induced Plk3 Expression Is NF-κB-dependent— EMSAs, immunoblotting for IκBα degradation, RT-PCR, and Northern blot analyses for Plk3 expression were performed using MDAPanc28/Puro and MDAPanc28/IκBαM cells stimulated with doxycycline (50 μg/ml) at the indicated times (Fig. 1). Within 24 h after doxycycline stimulation, both NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 1a, lanes 1–10) and IκBα degradation (Fig. 1b, lanes 1–8) were detected in the MDAPanc28/Puro cells but not the MDAPanc28/IκBαM cells. The doxycycline-induced expression of Plk3 mRNA in MDAPanc28/Puro cells increased with the time of treatment and reached its maximum level by 48 h (Fig. 1, c and d, lanes 1–4), whereas doxycycline-induced Plk3 expression in MDAPanc28/IκBαM cells was inhibited (Fig. 1, c and d, lanes 5–8). Quantification of the induction of Plk3 expression is shown in Fig. 1e. These results suggest that Plk3 is a target gene regulated by NF-κB. Plk3 Expression Is Induced by Various Stimuli—To determine whether Plk3 expression is induced by other NF-κB inducers in different cells, we stimulated HEK293/Puro and HEK293/IκBαM cells with doxycycline (50 μg/ml), MDAPanc-28/Puro, and MDAPanc-28/IκBαM with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and NIH3T3 cells with fibroblast growth factor-1 (20 ng/ml) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (30 μg/ml) for various times, as indicated, and isolated total RNA for measuring the levels of Plk3 expression (Fig. 2, a–c). Within 12 h of doxycycline stimulation of HEK293/Puro cells, the expression of Plk3 was induced and reached a maximal level at 48 h of doxycycline stimulation (Fig. 2a, lanes 1–4). In contrast, the expression of Plk3 was not induced in the doxycycline-stimulated HEK293/IκBαM cells (Fig. 2a). These results are consistent with the doxycycline-induced Plk3 expression in MDAPanc-28 cells in Fig. 1, c and d. In MDAPanc-28/Puro, but not in MDAPanc-28/IκBαM cells, the expression of Plk3 was induced by TNF-α stimulation. Interestingly, the TNF-α-induced Plk3 expression appears to be biphasic and occurred at 1 and 24 h of TNF-α-stimulation (Fig. 2b). This is consistent with the previous reports demonstrating biphasic NF-κB activation (27Schmidt C. Peng B. Li Z. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Niu J. Schmidt-Supprian M. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L.

Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). Fig. 2c shows that the expression of Plk3 is also induced by fibroblast growth factor-1 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These results suggest that the expression of Plk3 is induced by various NF-κB inducers in different cell lines. Plk3 Promoter Is Inducible With NF-κB—To further investigate how NF-κB mediates Plk3 induction by doxycycline stimulation in MDAPanc28 cells, we next cloned the promoter (1.8 kb) of the human Plk3 gene from the BAC clone RP11-269F19 (accession number AL592166) from human chromosome 1, which contains the whole genomic sequence of Plk3. Sequence analysis revealed that the Plk3 promoter has a GC-rich region located from bp –78 to –328 upstream of the translation initiation site. Of all of the nine reported transcripts found in the nucleotide and expressed sequence tag sequence data bases at NCBI, there are three mRNAs (accession numbers BC013899, AJ293866, and NM_004073) and six expressed sequence tags (accession numbers BM921223, BQ065567, BQ066297, BG437825, BF205939, and CD109602), with different length in the 5′-untranslated sequence initiated from the Plk3 promoter region (–63 to –239 bp). These transcripts were possibly due to the lack of a definite transcription start site, a characteristic of the GC-rich promoter. A κB enhancer element (TGGGAGTTCC) from –1130 to –1121 bp was identified, and other previously identified cis-regulatory elements, such as the binding site for basal transcription factor Sp-1, are also present (Fig. 3a). To confirm that the predicted κB motif in the Plk3 promoter is a bona fide NF-κB binding site, we performed EMSA for NF-κB DNA binding activity using 25-bp oligonucleotides with a WT κB motif (5′-CCTGAGGTTGGGAGTTCCAGACCAG-3′) and mutant motif (5′-CCTGAGGTTAAAAGTTCCAGACCAG-3′). As shown in competition and anti-p65 antibody supershift assays (Fig. 3b), the predicted WT NF-κB binding motif, but not the mutant, bound to p65-p50 and p50-p50 NF-κB complexes. These data suggest that this is indeed an NF-κB DNA-binding site. To determine whether p65/NF-κB binds to the κB site identified in the Plk3 promoter in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 3c, the Plk3 promoter DNA sequence was amplified from the anti-p65/NF-κB chromatin immunoprecipitates in the PCR using the specific PCR primers flanking the κB site in the Plk3 promoter region. The results suggest that p65/NF-κB directly interacted with the κB site in the Plk3 promoter region in MDAPanc-28/Puro cells, but this interaction was inhibited in MDAPanc-28/IκBαM cells. To determine whether the κB site identified in the Plk3 promoter is functional, we cloned the 1.8-kb promoter region of Plk3 into the pGL2-basic luciferase reporter vector (Plk3pLucWT) and generated the mutated κB site in Plk3 promoter luciferase reporter vector (Plk3pLucMT). The luciferase reporter activity was significantly stimulated by doxycycline in MEF cells transfected with the Plk3pLucWT but not with the Plk3pLucMT reporter gene construct (Fig. 3d). Stimulation with doxycycline induced high levels of luciferase activity in MDAPanc28/Puro and MEF cells but not in MDAPanc28/IκBαM or RelA-null MEF cells, transfected with the Plk3pLucWT reporter gene construct (Fig. 3, e and f). These data indicate that the induction of Plk3 gene expression by doxycycline is probably mediated directly by NF-κB and the κB site present in the Plk3 promoter. Doxycycline-induced Phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20 and Expression of p21waf1 Are Plk3-dependent—We previously showed that the doxycycline-induced phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20 in MDAPanc28 cells is NF-κB-dependent, and doxycycline-induced apoptosis was detected at 48 h in HCT116 p53+/+ cells but significantly delayed in HCT116 p53–/– cells (18Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Sclabas G.M. Li Z. Pelicano H. Peng B. Yao A. Niu J. Zhang W. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Huang P. Chiao P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27549-27559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To determine whether Plk3 is involved in the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20 after doxycycline stimulation, we inhibited Plk3 expression using Plk3 siRNA (Fig. 4a). Doxycycline-induced phosphorylation of p53 upon Ser-20 and p21waf1 expression was completely inhibited (Fig. 4, a and b). To confirm the involvement of Plk3 in the phosphorylation of p53, we performed immunoprecipitation assays using FLAG-Plk3-transfected MDAPanc28/Puro cells without and with doxycycline stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4c, doxycycline induced complex formation between Plk3 and p53. The in vitro kinase assay using FLAG-Plk3 and FLAG-Plk3K91R immunoprecipitated from doxycycline-stimulated cells, with purified p53 protein (aa 1–342) as a substrate, suggests that Plk3 phosphorylated p53 on Ser-20 (Fig. 4d). Taken together, these results suggest that Plk3 is directly involved in the phosphorylation of p53 upon Ser-20 response to doxycycline stimulation. Plk3 Induces p53-dependent and -independent Apoptosis— Previously, we showed that NF-κB functioned as a proapoptotic factor by activating the p53-signaling pathway in response to superoxide (18Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Sclabas G.M. Li Z. Pelicano H. Peng B. Yao A. Niu J. Zhang W. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Huang P. Chiao P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27549-27559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Superoxide-induced apoptosis was significantly delayed in p53-null HCT116 and MDAPanc-28/IκBαM cells, suggesting that NF-κB and p53 are involved in superoxide-induced apoptosis in these cells (18Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Sclabas G.M. Li Z. Pelicano H. Peng B. Yao A. Niu J. Zhang W. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Huang P. Chiao P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27549-27559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To determine the role of Plk3, a downstream target gene regulated by NF-κB, in the proapoptotic signaling cascade, we transfected Plk3 wild type and mutants into HCT116p53+/+ or HCT116p53–/– cells and measured the DNA fragmentation. Consistent with our previous finding (18Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Sclabas G.M. Li Z. Pelicano H. Peng B. Yao A. Niu J. Zhang W. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Huang P. Chiao P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27549-27559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), superoxide-induced apoptosis was delayed in the absence of p53 function in HCT116p53–/– cells (Fig. 5a). Similarly, Plk3-mediated apoptosis was delayed in HCT116p53–/– cells but not delayed in HCT116p53+/+ cells (Fig. 5b). The apoptosis induced by overexpression of a kinase-defective Plk3 mutant (Plk3K91R) (mutated ATP-binding site in the Plk3 catalytic domain) in HCT116p53+/+ cells was also delayed, whereas an N terminus deletion mutant (amino acids 1–141) of Plk3 (Plk3ΔN) failed to induce apoptosis in HCT116p53+/+ cells (Fig. 5c). These results suggest that Plk3-induced rapid onset of apoptosis is p53-dependent and that Plk3-mediated delayed onset of apoptosis is p53-independent and that Plk3 kinase activity may be partially involved in the induction of apoptosis. Plk3-induced Delayed Onset of Apoptosis Is Independent of p53—To further determine the effects of Plk3 on p53-independent cell death, we performed colony formation assays. Overexpression of Plk3 and Plk3K91R, but not Plk3ΔN, in HEK293 cells completely inhibited colony formation (Fig. 6, a and b). Overexpression of Plk3 greatly inhibited colony formation in both HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53–/– cells (Fig. 6, c and d). The quantification of colony formation was summarized in Fig. 6, e and f. Overexpression of Plk3 in HEK293 cells significantly inhibited cell growth by inducing apoptosis, and overexpression of Plk3K91R decreased but did not abolish this effect, whereas Plk3ΔN totally abolished this effect (Fig. 6, h and i). These results are consistent with those of the colony formation assays (Fig. 6, a–f). Taken together, these results further suggest that overexpression of Plk3 can mediate p53-independent apoptosis. The N-terminal Domain of Plk3 Is Required for Inducing Apoptosis—To determine the domains in Plk3 that play an essential role in the delayed proapoptotic signaling cascade, we carried out mutagenesis of Plk3. Since the N terminus deletion mutant (amino acids 1–141) of Plk3 (Plk3ΔN) failed to induce apoptosis in HCT116p53+/+ cells (Fig. 5c), we focused our analysis on the N terminus of Plk3. The Plk3 deletion mutants generated were summarized in Fig. 7a. Overexpression of wild-type Plk3 and Plk3 deletion mutant D52–107 inhibited colony formation (Fig. 7, c and d). On the other hand, overexpression of Plk3 deletion mutant D1–26 failed to inhibit colony formation (Fig. 7, b and e). Quantification of the colony formation is shown in Fig. 7f. Taken together, these results suggest that the N-terminal domain of 1–26 amino acid in Plk3 is required for its apoptotic function. Deletion of these 26 amino acids destroys three Src homology 3 domains on Plk3, which in turn may inhibit crucial interactions between Plk3 and other proapoptotic signaling molecules. Plk3 Is Essential in Doxycycline-induced Apoptosis—To determine whether Plk3 plays an essential role in doxycycline-induced apoptosis, we inhibited Plk3 expression in doxycycline-stimulated cells using Plk3 siRNA. In both HEK293 and MDAPanc-28/Puro cells, doxycycline-induced-apoptosis was inhibited by the transfection of Plk3 siRNA but not a control siRNA (Fig. 8, a and b). However, no apoptosis was detectable in TNF-α (50 ng/ml)-treated MDAPanc-28/Puro cells (Fig. 8c), although Plk3 expression is induced by TNF-α (Fig. 2b). Taken together, these data suggest that Plk3 plays a key role in doxycycline-induced apoptosis and that ectopic expression of Plk3 induces apoptosis. Furthermore, the findings imply that whether the function of NF-κB is proapoptotic or antiapoptotic may depend on the nature of the stimuli and outcome of the expression of genes in response to such stimuli. To determine whether the subcellular localization of Plk3 was involved in induction of apoptosis, both EGFP-tagged wild-type Plk3 and the N terminus deletion mutant of Plk3 (Plk3ΔN) were transfected into HEK293 cells and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 8b, Plk3 mainly localized to cell membrane and a condensed spot in the transfected cell and a much weaker diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm, whereas a very diffused distribution was found in the cells expressing EGFP-Plk3ΔN. The control EGFP vector generated a diffused pattern. Double labeling experiments using an anti-γ-tubulin antibody showed that Plk3 is localized around centrosomes in a condensed spot. These subcellular localization patterns suggest that Plk3 may be involved in regulating the microtubule dynamics and that dysregulation of Plk3 may induce mitotic catastrophe. Transcription factor NF-κB can regulate both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signaling pathways; however, less is known about the mechanism by which NF-κB induces apoptosis. Our results, summarized in Fig. 8c, suggest a possible mechanism by which NF-κB regulates proapoptotic-signaling cascades by inducing Plk3 expression, which in turn activates p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways in doxycycline/superoxide-induced cell death. We previously described a possible role of NF-κB signaling cascades in doxycycline/superoxide-induced apoptosis and showed that doxycycline/superoxide-induced apoptosis is inhibited in cells lacking functional NF-κB activity and is partly dependent on NF-κB-mediated p53 activation (18Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Sclabas G.M. Li Z. Pelicano H. Peng B. Yao A. Niu J. Zhang W. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Huang P. Chiao P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27549-27559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In that study, p53 was stabilized primarily by reducing Hdm2 full-length protein and by inducing a kinase to phosphorylate p53 protein at Ser-20, which in turn induced the expression of its downstream target genes, such as PUMA, for initiating proapoptotic signaling (18Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Sclabas G.M. Li Z. Pelicano H. Peng B. Yao A. Niu J. Zhang W. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Huang P. Chiao P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27549-27559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These results suggest that NF-κB regulates a kinase that functions as a proapoptotic factor to activate the p53 signaling pathways. Previous studies have shown that Plk3 functionally links DNA damage to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the p53 pathway by interacting directly with p53 and phosphorylating p53 on Ser-20 in response to reactive oxygen species and irradiation (21Xie S.

Our studies demonstrate the following findings: first, Plk3 is an NF-κB downstream target gene in response to doxycycline/superoxide stimulation; second, the promoter of the Plk3 gene contains a κB site that is directly involved in its induction by the NF-κB complexes; third, after induction by doxycycline/superoxide, Plk3 forms a complex with p53 and may be directly involved in the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20; fourth, Plk3 plays a key role in doxycycline-induced apoptosis; and fifth, Plk3 induces cell death, possibly by inducing p53-dependent and -independent pathways. Similar to growth factor withdrawal, chemotherapeutic agents, radiation, cytokines, and other apoptosis inducers, doxycycline induces apoptotic cell death with structural and morphologic features such as cell shrinkage, mitochondrial swelling, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation (13Wyllie A.H.

Our previous study showed that doxycycline induced the formation of superoxide, which may in turn induce NF-κB activation (18Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Sclabas G.M. Li Z. Pelicano H. Peng B. Yao A. Niu J.

In this report, we have shown that doxycycline/superoxide-induced apoptosis is partly mediated by phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20 by Plk3. A previous study showed that Plk3 acts downstream of both ATM and Chk2 in this important pathway of DNA damage-dependent activation of p53 and that Chk2 in fact stimulates Plk3 activity in response to DNA damage (38Xie S. Wu H. Wang Q. Kunicki J. Thomas R.O. Hollingsworth R.E. Cogswell J. Dai W. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Plk3 plays an important role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and centrosomal function in the cell, and the deregulated expression of Plk3 results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (39Wang Q.

Plk3 has been shown to localize to the cellular cortex and to the cell midbody during exit from mitosis (40Conn C.W. Hennigan R.F. Dai W. Sanchez Y. Stambrook P.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6826-6831PubMed Google Scholar), a finding that is consistent with the notion that Plk3 plays a role in cytokinesis and that suggests that altered expression of Plk3 interferes with cellular proliferation by impeding cytokinesis. The expression of Plk3 is transiently induced by growth factors and cytokines and does not require protein synthesis for transcriptional activation (23Li B. Ouyang B. Pan H. Reissmann P.T. Slamon D.J. Arceci R. Lu L. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19402-19408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Three AU-rich elements, the most common RNA-destabilizing elements known in mammalian cells, are present in the 3′-untranslated regions of Plk3 and are also present in many labile mRNAs (41Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Guo Y. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10351-10357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 42Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the activity of Plk3 is transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated. Our results further show that overexpression of Plk3 induces apoptosis, suggesting that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of Plk3 plays a key role in the control of Plk3 function. However, the posttranslational regulation of Plk3 and the mechanisms by which Plk3 induces apoptosis still remain unclear. In summary, our results suggest a mechanism by which NF-κB functions as a proapoptotic factor. In response to high levels of superoxide induced by doxycycline, NF-κB, a key regulator of the antiapoptotic pathway, is required to induce Plk3 to initiate apoptosis independent of p53 activity, possibly involving the Src homology 3 domain in the N terminus of Plk3, and to phosphorylate p53 protein at Ser-20, which in turn induces the expression of its downstream target genes, such as PUMA, to initiate proapoptotic signaling.

Whereas the polypeptide serving this function in bacteria contains one OB fold, the eukaryotic functional homolog comprises a complex of three proteins, each harboring at least one OB fold. Here we show that unlike these groups of organisms, the Euryarchaeota has exploited the potential in the OB fold to re-invent single-stranded DNA-binding proteins many times. However, the most common form is a protein with two OB folds and one zinc finger domain. We created several deletion mutants of this protein based on its conserved motifs, and from these structures functional chimeras were synthesized, supporting the hypothesis that gene duplication and recombination could lead to novel functional forms of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. Biophysical studies showed that the orthologs of the two OB fold/one zinc finger replication protein A in Methanosarcina acetivorans and Methanopyrus kandleri exhibit two binding modes, wrapping and stretching of DNA. However, the ortholog in Ferroplasma acidarmanus possessed only the stretching mode. Most interestingly, a second single-stranded DNA-binding protein, FacRPA2, in this archaeon exhibited the wrapping mode. Domain analysis of this protein, which contains a single OB fold, showed that its architecture is similar to the functional homologs thought to be unique to the Crenarchaeotes. Most unexpectedly, genes coding for similar proteins were found in the genomes of eukaryotes, including humans. Although the diversity shown by archaeal single-stranded DNA-binding proteins is unparalleled, the presence of their simplest form in many organisms across all domains of life is of greater evolutionary consequence.

A. 1990; 87: 5088-5090Google Scholar). The bacterial and eukaryotic proteins are commonly designated single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) and replication protein A (RPA), respectively, and due to the high similarity between the archaeal and eukaryotic proteins, the archaeal counterparts are also termed RPAs (5Kelly T.J. Simancek P. Brush G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14634-14639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Aside from the major domains of life, ssDNA-binding proteins have been isolated from viruses, such as adenovirus (6Tucker P.A. Tsernoglou D. Tucker A.D. Coenjaerts F.E. Leeders H. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2994-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and bacteriophages (7Alberts B.M Frey L. Nature. 1970; 227: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Indeed, the first example of this important protein family was described in T4 phage (7Alberts B.M Frey L. Nature. 1970; 227: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The widespread distribution of ssDNA-binding proteins in nature is due to their key roles in DNA transactions, especially in replication (8Brill S.J. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), recombination (9Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol.

In addition, they prevent formation of secondary structures in exposed ssDNA, and several members of this protein family are reported to stimulate their cognate DNA polymerases during DNA synthesis (1Robbins J.B.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2561-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) contain ssDNA binding domains with a fold reminiscent of an OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding) fold, a five-stranded β-sheet coiled to form a closed β-barrel (21Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In ssDNA-binding proteins, the OB folds typically comprise ∼100 amino acids (21Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), and although the majority of bacterial SSB genes code for products that contain a single OB fold, their active forms are homotetramers (22De Vries J. Genschel J. Urbanke C. Thole H. Wackernagel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Genschel J. Litz L. Thole H. Roemling U. Urbanke C.

Most interestingly, in Deinococcus radiodurans (25Eggington J.M. Haruta N. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. BMC Microbiol. 2004; 4: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and Thermus aquaticus (26Dabrowski S. Olszewski M. Piatek R. Brillowska-Dabrowska A. Konopa G. Kur J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3307-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), genes encoding SSBs with two OB folds have been described recently. The D. radiodurans SSB, however, dimerizes to mimic its homotetrameric counterparts (27Bernstein D.A. Eggington J.M. Killoran M.P. Misic A.M. Cox M.M. Keck J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8575-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast to bacterial SSBs, eukaryotic RPA is a heterotrimeric complex composed of proteins of ∼70, 30, and 14 kDa (3Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), whereas in the archaea, the organization of RPAs is more complex, as demonstrated in this study. Currently, culturable archaea are grouped into two main subdomains, namely Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota (4Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheeler M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5088-5090Google Scholar). Whereas to date the crenarchaeotes have been shown to harbor a single gene encoding a single OB fold RPA, the euryarchaeotes on the other hand display an unusual diversity of these proteins. An interesting aspect of the crenarchaeal RPA is that it has an eukaryotic/ archaeal type OB fold; however, the domain organization is very similar to bacterial SSBs (28Wadsworth R.I. White M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Haseltine C.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1505-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The striking homologies among the individual OB folds of the eukaryotic RPAs and the significant structural similarity they share with the ssDNA binding domain of bacterial SSBs have led to the postulate that RPAs evolved from gene duplication events in an ancestral SSB gene (30Chedin F. Seitz E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 273-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Philipova D. Mullen J.R. Maniar H.S. Lu J. Gu C. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2222-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Here we show that no group of organisms has exploited the potential in the ssDNA-binding module for engineering of novel RPAs as the archaeal subdomain Euryarchaeota. Members of this group, which includes hyperthermophiles, mesophiles, halophiles, sulfate reducers, acidophiles, and methanogens, have re-invented RPAs many times. However, the most widespread RPA in these ecologically different organisms is a protein with two OB folds and a zinc finger domain. To further our understanding of this novel RPA, we used deletion, biochemical, and biophysical analyses to investigate the structure and function of naturally occurring candidates and their artificially synthesized counterparts. In addition, we showed that an RPA type that was originally thought to be exclusive to crenarchaeotes is indeed found in some euryarchaeotes and perhaps in many eukaryotes, including humans, plants, and a nematode. Cloning of macrpa3, mkarpa, facrpa1, and facrpa2 Genes—The cloning of macrpa3 was described previously (1Robbins J.B. Murphy M.C. White B.A. Mackie R.I. Ha T. Cann I.K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6315-6326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A single gene (GenBank™ accession number NP_614724.1), encoding the only RPA-like protein (Fig. 1A, MkaRPA) in the Methanopyrus kandleri genome (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi), was amplified with MkaRPAF and MkaRPAR primers (Table I), which incorporated NdeI and SalI sites, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T, a TA-cloning vector (Promega), and sequenced to confirm the integrity of the gene. The DNA insert was released by digestion with NdeI and SalI and inserted into a pET28a vector predigested with NdeI and XhoI, which is compatible with SalI. The insertion placed the gene in-frame with six histidines (His6 tag) encoded by the plasmid. The gene was designated mkarpa, and the construct was designated pET28/mkarpa. Two Ferroplasma acidarmanus (Fac) genes encoding RPA-like sequences, facrpa1 and facrpa2, were amplified with the primer pairs FacRPA1F/FacRPA1R and FacRPA2F/FacRPA2R, respectively (Table I). The F. acidarmanus genomic DNA was kindly provided by Dr. Jill Banfield (University of California, Berkeley). Each of the two PCR products contained an NdeI and XhoI restriction site incorporated in the forward (F) and reverse (R) primers, respectively. After cloning and sequencing in the TA-cloning vector as described above, the correct fragments were inserted into a pET28a vector modified by replacing the kanamycin resistance gene with that for ampicillin resistance. The constructs were designated pET28/facrpa1 and pET28/facrpa2.Table IOligonucleotides used in this study The oligonucleotides under rpa genes were used for amplifying the genes encoding RPAs in M. acetivorans (Mac), M. kandleri (Mka), and F. acidarmanus (Fac). The oligonucleotides under truncated genes were used in creating truncated derivatives of MacRPA3 and MkaRPA. The oligonucleotides under chimeric genes were used in creating chimeric MacRPA genes. The mkapolBI oligonucleotides were used to amplify MkaPolBI; the gel retardation assay (GRA) oligonucleotide was the probe for gel retardation assay; the FPA oligonucleotides were used for fluorescence polarization anisotropy experiments; the FRET oligonucleotides were annealed together to measure fluorescence resonance energy transfer as protein bound to the ssDNA region; and the primer extension oligonucleotide was annealed to the bacteriophage M13mp18 single-stranded DNA in the primer extension assay.

For macrpa3, an N-terminal truncation (MacΔN57) that resulted in a protein lacking the first 57 amino acids of the wild type polypeptide (Fig. 1B) was created by PCR amplification with the forward primer MacΔN57F and the reverse primer MacRPA3R (Table I). Two C-terminal truncations were also made in macrpa3. The first C-terminal truncation was achieved by PCR with the primer pair MacRPA3F/MacΔC1R (Table I). This PCR amplification removed the conserved zinc finger domain and its downstream amino acid residues (Fig. 1B), and the product of this construct, which contained only the two OB folds found in MacRPA3, was designated MacΔC1 (Fig. 1B). The second truncation was carried out with the primer pair MacRPA3F/MacΔC2R (Table I), and this reaction removed the posterior OB fold together with its downstream amino acid sequence. The product of this construct has only one OB fold, and it was designated MacΔC2 (Fig. 1B). The forward and reverse primers contained NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. Therefore, after sequence verification, each truncated gene was inserted into pET28a for expression as His6-tagged proteins to facilitate protein purification. The two primers MkaRPAF/MkaΔC1R were used to delete the zinc finger domain together with its downstream residues from the hyperthermophilic MkaRPA. The forward and reverse primers contained NdeI and SalI, respectively. Therefore, after cloning into the TA-cloning vector to confirm the integrity of the PCR product by nucleotide sequencing, the correct fragment was retrieved by digestion with NdeI/SalI and inserted into pET28a. This truncated gene coded for a product with two OB folds, as in MacΔC1, and was designated MkaΔC1. Chimeric MacRPAs—A PCR method was used to artificially construct three chimeric RPAs from three individual RPAs (Fig. 1B, MacRPA1, MacRPA2, and MacRPA3) reported in Methanosarcina acetivorans (1Robbins J.B. Murphy M.C. White B.A. Mackie R.I. Ha T. Cann I.K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6315-6326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The RPA2-N/RPA3-C chimera was a fusion of the N-terminal half of MacRPA2 (including the first OB fold, RPA2-N) and the C-terminal half of MacRPA3 (the second OB fold and its downstream amino acid residues, RPA3-C) (Fig. 1B). The fusion was achieved by two PCR amplifications. There was an initial reaction that amplified the two individual fragments and a second amplification that fused the two fragments. RPA2-N was amplified by using MacRPA2F and RPA2-chimR2, whereas RPA3-C was amplified by using RPA3-chimF2 and MacRPA3R. The two primers RPA2-chimR2 and RPA3-chimF2 contained overlapping nucleotide sequences and are complementary. Aliquots of the two fragments were mixed and used in a second PCR amplification without primers during the first 5 cycles to allow the two fragments to fuse through their overlapping sequences. The primers targeting the N- and C-terminal regions (MacRPA2F and MacRPA3R) of the chimeric gene were then added to the reaction mixture, and PCR amplification was continued for another 20 cycles. The fusion for RPA3-N/RPA2-C followed the same procedure. The N-terminal half or RPA3-N was amplified by using MacRPA3F as the forward primer and RPA3-chimR2 as the reverse primer. The C-terminal half was amplified with RPA2-chimF2 as the forward primer and MacRPA2R as the reverse primer. After obtaining the fragments, aliquots were used to generate a chimeric gene with MacRPA3F and MacRPA2R as the primers targeting the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively, as described above. The last chimera, RPA3/RPA1-OB, involved replacement of the two OB folds of MacRPA3 with the two middle OB folds of MacRPA1 (Fig. 1B). This chimera required the fusion of the following three PCR products: the N terminus of MacRPA3 ahead of the OB folds (RPA3-N2), the two middle OB folds of MacRPA1 (Fig. 1B, B and B′ of MacRPA1), and the zinc finger domain of MacRPA3 and its downstream sequences (RPA3-C2). The three fragments RPA3-N2, RPA1–2-OB, and RPA3-C2 were amplified with the primer pairs MacRPA3F/RPA3-chimR3, Chim3-F2/Chim3-R3, and Chim3-F3/MacRPA3R, respectively. The internal primers RPA3-chimR3/Chim3-F2 and Chim3-R3/Chim3-F3 overlapped in sequence. Therefore, a PCR amplification with aliquots of all three fragments as the template and MacRPA3F/MacRPA3R as the primers targeting the N- and C-terminal regions resulted in a fusion of all three fragments. Each of the chimeric genes was cloned into the TA-cloning vector and sequenced to ensure its correctness. The fragments were then released by digestion with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into pET28a as described above. T4 DNA ligase and all restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The ligation resulted in each gene being placed in-frame with the His6 tag encoded by the plasmid. Cloning of M. kandleri PolBI—The gene mkapolBI, encoding the family B DNA polymerase of M. kandleri, was amplified by PCR with MkaPolBF and MkaPolBR, as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. A special commercial kit (Hercules, Stratagene) was used for the PCR amplification due to the high G + C content of M. kandleri genomic DNA. The PCR product was then ligated into the TA-cloning vector and sequenced to ensure its correctness. The fragment was released by digestion with NdeI and NotI and inserted into a NdeI/NotI-linearized pET28a. The construct was designated pET28/mkapolBI. Production of Recombinant Proteins—Each of the expression vectors, except for pET28/mkapolBI, was used to transform Escherichia coli cells (E. coli BL21-CodonPlus, Stratagene) by heat shock transformation. Cells were spread on LB plates containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol at 100 and 50 μg/ml, respectively, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. A single colony from each cell line was cultured in LB broth supplemented with the same antibiotics. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.3, gene expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the culture at a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The temperature for the incubation was then dropped to 15 °C, and the culturing continued overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0; 300 mm NaCl), and lysed by a French pressure cell (American Instruments Co.) to release the cell contents. Because each of the genes was inserted in-frame with an N-terminal His6 tag encoded by the pET28 plasmid, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant containing the His6-tagged protein was applied to a buffer A-equilibrated metal affinity resin (TALON™ cobalt affinity resin, Clontech). After several washes with the same buffer, each protein was eluted with 15 ml of buffer A containing 150 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing the proteins of interest were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 50 mm NaCl), and the dialysate was applied to an anion exchange column (HiTrap Q, 5 ml; Amersham Biosciences) fitted to a high pressure liquid chromatography apparatus (AKTA Explorer 10; Amersham Biosciences). After washing with 4 column volumes of buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (0–1.0 m) of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1.0 m NaCl) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and fractions of 0.5 ml in volume were collected. Aliquots of fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to examine their purity. Highly purified proteins were dialyzed against buffer B supplemented with dithiothreitol (DTT) at 0.5 mm and stored at 4 °C. Recombinant M. acetivorans PolBI and M. kandleri PolBI were produced as described for the RPA proteins. However, because the plasmid used in constructing these two vectors contained the kanamycin resistance gene instead of ampicillin, all cultures were supplemented with kanamycin at 30 μg/ml and chloramphenicol at 50 μg/ml. Gel Filtration Analysis—To determine the subunit organization of the purified full-length RPA proteins and the truncated derivatives, each protein was subjected to gel filtration analysis on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was fitted to the HPLC apparatus described above, and the resin was pre-equilibrated with a buffer made up of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 150 mm NaCl. Each protein was dialyzed against this buffer and injected at 100 μg. The chromatography was developed with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and fractions of volume 0.2 ml were collected. To calibrate the column, a set of protein standards (ferritin, 440 kDa; catalase, 232 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa; and ribonuclease A, 13.7 kDa; Amersham Biosciences) was analyzed with the same column under the same conditions. The fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE. Gel Retardation Assay—The full-length RPAs from M. kandleri (MkaRPA) and F. acidarmanus (FacRPA1 and FacRPA2) and the chimeric proteins were used in gel retardation assays to determine whether these proteins can discriminate between ssDNA and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). For the experiments with MkaRPA and FacRPA1, 5 pmol of protein was incubated with 1 pmol of a γ-32P-end-labeled 42-mer oligonucleotide (Table I, gel retardation assay) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 15 mm MgCl2,2mm DTT, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The final volume of each reaction was 20 μl, and the FacRPA1 reaction was incubated at 25 °C, whereas that of the hyperthermophilic MkaRPA was incubated at 65 °C. The same buffer and temperature conditions were used for the gel retardation assay for FacRPA2, except for the amount of protein (7.5 pmol) added to the reaction mixture. For the chimeric proteins, except for RPA2-N/RPA3-C (5 pmol/reaction), a higher amount of protein (10 pmol/reaction) was necessary to clearly visualize the gel-retarded products. Thermostability of MkaRPA—The MkaRPA comes from an organism that grows at temperatures above 100 °C. Therefore, we tested its thermostability by heating at 85, 95, and 100 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation to pellet any denatured protein. The protein remaining in solution was then tested for its ability to bind to ssDNA. Fluorescence Polarization Anisotropy (FPA)—To obtain a measure of the binding of the various RPAs and the truncated derivatives to ssDNA, we conducted FPA experiments. FPA measures the rotational freedom of a fluorescent dye attached to a biomolecule by determining the intensity of polarized fluorescence as the polarized excitation is changed (1Robbins J.B.

Kluwer/Academic/Plenum, New York1999: 291-302Google Scholar). If the dye rotates very quickly within its fluorescent lifetime, there will be little correlation between the excitation and emission polarization, resulting in an anisotropy value close to 0. However, if the dye is very rigidly attached, the emission polarization will be similar to the excitation polarization resulting in an anisotropy value of 0.4. The FPA measurements were carried out with an HPLC-purified 18-base ssDNA tagged with fluorescein at the 5′ end (Table I, FL-18, Operon Technologies) in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2,and2mm DTT. The reactions were performed at 23 ± 1 °C in a fluorometer (Cary Eclipse, Varian Inc.) by exciting the fluorescein at 490 nm and measuring emission at 518 nm. The concentrations of the proteins are given in monomers, dimers, or trimers as determined by gel filtration chromatography for that particular protein. To find the dissociation constant, Kd, and Hill coefficient, n, for each RPA, titrations of the proteins were carried out until the anisotropy saturated at a maximum value. The curves were then fitted with a Hill binding model using Origin 7 (OriginLab Corp.). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—FRET is a widely used “spectroscopic ruler” for measuring the distance between two fluorescent dyes attached to a biomolecule (1Robbins J.B. Murphy M.C.

https://openalex.org/W2078956734,"Polymyxin B is a lipopolysaccharide binding antibiotic used to inactivate potential lipopolysaccharide contaminations when evaluating the activity of different agents on innate immune cells. We report that polymyxin B is able to induce directly in monocyte-derived human dendritic cells (DCs) several functional and molecular modifications characteristic of DCs undergoing a maturation process. DCs incubated with polymyxin B up-regulate the expression of HLA class I and II, the co-stimulatory CD86 molecule, and show an increase in the fraction of adherent cells at short time, which persist at 48 h of incubation. Adhesion to the plate was required for the polymyxin B-induced DCs maturation. A transient activation of IκB-α/NF-κB and ERK1/2 pathways at short time and a further ERK1/2 activation at long term were also detected. Neither up-regulation of the maturation marker CD83 nor activation of p38 nor induction of cytokines secretion was observed in DCs treated with polymyxin B. We demonstrated that inhibition of IκB-α/NF-κB pathway abolishes polymyxin B effects. ERK1/2 inhibition instead allowed DCs treated with polymyxin B to progress in their maturation process as revealed by the increased up-regulation of the CD83 co-stimulatory molecules, the activation of p38, and the reduced adhesion to culture plates at 48 h of incubation. Our results indicate that polymyxin B induces a partial maturation of human DCs through increased adhesion to a substrate and activation of the IκB-α/NF-κB pathway. The increased ERK1/2 activation observed, even though correlating with the initial phases of the maturation process, actually inhibits the occurrence of full maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1968838150,"Fundamental considerations predict that macroscopic quantum systems such as superfluids and the electrons in superconductors will undergo oscillatory motion when forced through a small constriction. Here we induce these oscillations in superfluid helium-4 (4He) by pushing it through an array of nanometre-sized apertures. The oscillations, which are detected as an audible whistling sound, obey the so-called Josephson frequency relation and occur coherently among all the apertures. The discovery of this property in 4He at the relatively high temperature of 2 K (2,000 times higher than the temperature at which a related but different phenomenon occurs in 3He) may pave the way for a new class of practical rotation sensors of unprecedented precision."
https://openalex.org/W2129688301,"Although GATA-1 and GATA-2 were shown to be essential for the development of hematopoietic cells by gene targeting experiments, they were also reported to inhibit the growth of hematopoietic cells. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effects of GATA-1 and GATA-2 on cytokine signals. A tamoxifen-inducible form of GATA-1 (GATA-1/ERT) showed a minor inhibitory effect on interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent growth of an IL-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3. On the other hand, it drastically inhibited TPO-dependent growth and gp130-mediated growth/survival of Ba/F3. Similarly, an estradiol-inducible form of GATA-2 (GATA-2/ER) disrupted thrombopoietin (TPO)-dependent growth and gp130-mediated growth/survival of Ba/F3. As for this mechanism, we found that both GATA-1 and GATA-2 directly bound to STAT3 both in vitro and in vivo and inhibited its DNA-binding activity in gel shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, whereas they hardly affected STAT5 activity. In addition, endogenous GATA-1 was found to interact with STAT3 in normal megakaryocytes, suggesting that GATA-1 may inhibit STAT3 activity in normal hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, we found that GATA-1 suppressed STAT3 activity through its N-zinc finger domain. Together, these results suggest that, besides the roles as transcription factors, GATA family proteins modulate cytokine signals through protein-protein interactions, thereby regulating the growth and survival of hematopoietic cells. Although GATA-1 and GATA-2 were shown to be essential for the development of hematopoietic cells by gene targeting experiments, they were also reported to inhibit the growth of hematopoietic cells.

Together, these results suggest that, besides the roles as transcription factors, GATA family proteins modulate cytokine signals through protein-protein interactions, thereby regulating the growth and survival of hematopoietic cells. GATA family transcription factors are composed of six members (GATA-1–6) and play indispensable roles in the development of diverse cell types according to their unique tissue distribution (1.Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). These factors bind to a consensus DNA sequence called a GATA motif (A/T)GATA(A/G) in the regulatory region of their target genes through two highly conserved zinc finger domains, both of which include the configuration Cys-X2-Cys-X17-Cys-X2-Cys.

Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Among GATA family members, at least three GATA factors (GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3) are critically involved in different aspects of hematopoiesis. GATA-1, the first cloned member of this family, is expressed at high levels in erythroid cells, mast cells, and megakaryocytes and at lower levels in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. GATA-1 is considered to be essential for primitive and definitive erythropoiesis, because GATA-1-null cells did not contribute to erythropoiesis in chimeric mice generated from embryonic stem cells lacking GATA-1 (3.Penvy L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. D'Agani V. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro experiments showed that GATA-1-null embryonic stem cells are unable to differentiate into mature erythroid cells due to apoptosis (4.Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 5.Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9623-9627Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lineage-selective GATA-1 knock-down mice exhibited striking thrombocytopenia as well as severe anemia (6.Schivdasani R.A. Fujiwara Y. McDevitt M. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3965-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). These results imply that GATA-1 plays an essential role not only in erythropoiesis but also in megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. However, the increased proliferation of megakaryocytes was also observed in the spleen of lineage-selective GATA-1 knock-down mice (6.Schivdasani R.A. Fujiwara Y. McDevitt M. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3965-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Similarly, heterozygous mutant mice chimeric for GATA-1 gene displayed marked splenomegaly due to the massive accumulation of proerythroblasts and megakaryocytes (7.Takahashi S. Komeno T. Suwabe N. Yoh K. Nakajima O. Nishimura S. Kuroha T. Nagasawa T. Yamamoto M. Blood. 1998; 92: 434-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, primary megakaryocytes prepared from GATA-1-deficient mice exhibited hyperproliferation in liquid cultures (8.Vyas P. Ault K. Jackson C.W. Orkin S.H. Shivdasani R.A. Blood. 1999; 93: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These lines of evidence suggest that GATA-1 might suppress the growth of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells regardless of its critical role in their development. GATA-2 is highly expressed in pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and moderately in early stage of erythroid cells, mast cells, and megakaryocytes (9.Orlic D. Anderson S. Biesecker L.G. Sorrentino B.P. Bodine D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4601-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). GATA-2 knock-out mice die around embryonic days 9.5–10.5 due to a pan-hematopoietic defect, providing evidence that GATA-2 is a key regulator of development, maintenance, and/or function of hematopoietic stem cells (10.Tsai F.-Y. Keller G. Kuo F.C. Weiss M. Chen J. Rosenblatt M. Alt F.W. Orkin. S.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the in vitro experiment using GATA-2−/- embryonic stem cells showed that GATA-2 was necessary for proliferation/survival of early hematopoietic cells (11.Tsai F.-Y. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1997; 89: 3636-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, as was the case with GATA-1, it was also reported that retrovirus-transferred wild-type (WT) GATA-2 inhibited the growth of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells (12.Persons D.A. Allay J.A. Allay E.R. Ashmun R.A. Orlic D. Jane S.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 488-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that an estrogen-inducible chimeric form of GATA-2, GATA-2/estrogen receptor (ER), suppressed cytokine-dependent growth of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells in response to estradiol (ED) (13.Heyworth C. Gale K. Dexter M. May G. Enver T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1847-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14.Ezoe S. Matsumura I. Nakata S. Gale K. Ishihara K. Minegishi N. Machii T. Kitamura T. Yamamoto M. Enver T. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2002; 100: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, at present, the functional properties of GATA-1 and GATA-2 in the growth and survival of hematopoietic cells is controversial, and, of course, its mechanism remains unknown. Hematopoiesis is regulated by a number of hematopoietic growth factors, including IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, GM-CSF, G-CSF, erythropoietin, TPO, stem cell factor, and fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand. These growth factors exert their effects through activation of various intracellular signaling cascades such as Janus family of protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways. Among these signaling pathways, the STAT family of transcription factors plays a pivotal role in the regulation of growth and survival of hematopoietic cells (15.Levy D.E. Darnell. Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). For example, STAT3 regulates cell growth through the transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1 and c-myc (16.Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2485) Google Scholar, 17.Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukada T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J.

Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Also, STAT5 mediates cell growth through the induction of cyclin D1 and pim-1 (19.Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 20.Shirogane T. Fukada T. Muller J.M. Shima D.T. Hibi M. Hirano T.

In an attempt to clarify the roles of GATA transcription factors in the growth and survival of hematopoietic cells, in this study, we examined their effects on cytokine signals. Here we found that GATA-1 and GATA-2 inhibit STAT3 activity through the direct protein-protein interactions, thereby inhibiting cytokine-dependent growth and survival of hematopoietic cells. These results suggest that, in addition to the roles as transcription factors, GATA transcription factors would exert various effects through protein-protein interactions. Reagents and Antibodies—The antibodies (Abs) against GATA-1 (N6) and STAT3 (H190) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), the anti-HA Ab (12CA5) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN), and an anti-FLAG Ab (M2) was from Sigma. Plasmid Constructs and cDNAs—Expression vectors for GATA-1/ERT and GATA-2/ER were described previously (13.Heyworth C. Gale K. Dexter M. May G. Enver T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1847-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for WT GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 were generated by subcloning these cDNAs into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Various types of GATA-1 mutants were constructed by the PCR method and subcloned into pcDNA3.

Cell Lines and Cultures—A murine IL-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3 was cultured in RPMI (Nakarai Tesq, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Flow, North Ryde, Australia) and 1 ng/ml IL-3. NIH3T3, 293T, and C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Preparation of Stable Transformants from Ba/F3—We stably introduced various expression vectors into Ba/F3 by electroporation (250 V and 960 microfarads) (Bio-Rad). The transfected clones were selected by the culture with G418 (1.2 mg/ml), puromycin (1 μg/ml), hygromycin (0.5 mg/ml), and/or blasticidin S hydrochloride (30 μg/ml) according to the transfected plasmid. Flow Cytometry—DNA content of the cultured cells was quantitated by staining with propidium iodide and analyzed on FACSort (BD Biosciences) (24.Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K.

Cell cycle analysis was performed with the program Modfit LT2.0 (BD Biosciences). Northern Blot Analysis—The methods for the isolation of total cellular RNA and Northern blot were described previously (24.Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Miyagawa J. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation Analysis and Immunoblotting—293T cells were transfected with various expression vectors by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (25.Matsumura I. Kawasaki A. Tanaka H. Sonoyama J. Ezoe S. Minegishi N. Nakajima K. Yamamoto M. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 2440-2450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 12 h, the cells were washed and cultured for 24 h. The isolation of total cellular lysate, immunoprecipitation, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed according to the procedures described previously (25.Matsumura I. Kawasaki A. Tanaka H. Sonoyama J. Ezoe S. Minegishi N. Nakajima K. Yamamoto M. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 2440-2450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Luciferase Assays—Luciferase assays were performed with a Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega, Madison, WI) as previously described (19.Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In short, NIH3T3 and C2C12 cells (2 × 105 cells seeded in 60-mm dish) were transfected with the indicated effector genes along with 2 μg of a reporter gene for STAT3 (4 × APRE-Luc), STAT5 (3 × β-Cas-Luc) (26.Matsumura I.

After 12 h, the cells were washed and serum-deprived for 24 h. Then, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer supplied by the manufacturer, followed by the measurement of the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities on a luminometer LB96P (Berthold Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The relative firefly luciferase activities were calculated by normalizing transfection efficiency according to the Renilla luciferase activities. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and similar results were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The isolation of nuclear extract and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were performed according to the procedures described previously (27.Tanaka H.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed with a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacture's instructions. Briefly, cells (3 × 106 per sample) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. After the isolation of nuclear extract, chromatin was sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 bp by the sonifier. STAT3·DNA binding complexes were immunoprecipitated with an anti-STAT3 Ab or control rabbit IgG. The immunoprecipitated DNA was eluted and subjected to the PCR reactions using AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), in the following thermocycling conditions: 94 °C for 10 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. The sequences of the primer set in the JunB promoter are as follows: sense, 5′-TGGCCGCTGTTTACAAGGACAC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCTTTTCTCTCCCTCCGTGGTA-3′. PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels and visualized by Syber Green (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) staining. GST Pull-down Assays—The production and purification of GST-STAT3 fusion proteins were performed according to the procedures as previously reported (28.Kawasaki A. Matsumura I. Kataoka Y. Takigawa E. Nakajima K. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2003; 101: 3668-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled GATA-1 was prepared by a TnT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). For each binding reaction, 20 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 50 μg of TnT reaction solution at 4 °C for 1 h. The binding complexes were separated by gel electrophoresis and subjected to autoradiography. Isolation of Murine Bone Marrow Lin−Cells and Their Culture with TPO—Murine bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation, and Lin− cells were purified by MACS (Miltenyl Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) (14.Ezoe S. Matsumura I. Nakata S. Gale K. Ishihara K. Minegishi N. Machii T. Kitamura T. Yamamoto M. Enver T. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2002; 100: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The purified Lin− cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 30 ng/ml TPO for 6 days. After this culture, about 80% of the cultured cells showed polyploid morphology compatible with megakaryocytes and were positive for CD41 (data not shown). Effects of GATA-1 on Cytokine-dependent Growth and Survival of Ba/F3—To examine the effects of GATA-1 on cytokine-dependent growth of hematopoietic cells in a ligand-inducible system, in this study, we utilized GATA-1/ERT, a chimera consisting of full-length GATA-1 and the mutated ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptor. This chimeric GATA-1 reveals GATA-1 activity in response to tamoxifen (4-HT) as previously reported (13.Heyworth C. Gale K. Dexter M. May G. Enver T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1847-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). At first, we stably introduced GATA-1/ERT into a murine IL-3-dependent proB cell line Ba/F3; this clone was designated Ba/F3/G1ERT. Under the culture without 4-HT, Ba/F3/G1ERT proliferated in response to IL-3 with the growth curve similar to that of parental Ba/F3 (Fig. 1A, left panel; the growth curve of parental Ba/F3 is not shown). Although the 4-HT treatment hardly influenced the growth of the mock-transfected Ba/F3 (Ba/F3/Mock) (Fig. 1A, right panel), 4-HT-activated GATA-1 suppressed the growth of Ba/F3/G1ERT by 20% (Fig. 1A, left panel). In agreement with this result, the 4-HT treatment reduced the proportion of proliferating cells in S-G2/M phase from 60% to 47% at 72 h in DNA content analysis (Fig. 1D). To further examine the effects of GATA-1 on cytokine-dependent growth of Ba/F3, we introduced the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor c-Mpl and a chimeric receptor G-CSFR/gp130 (consisting of the extracellular domain of G-CSF receptor and the cytoplasmic domain of gp130) (17.Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukada T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 18.Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) into Ba/F3/G1ERT and Ba/F3/Mock; these clones were designated Ba/F3/c-Mpl/G1ERT and Ba/F3/gp130/G1ERT, Ba/F3/c-Mpl/Mock, and Ba/F3/gp130/Mock, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1B, Ba/F3/c-Mpl/G1ERT and Ba/F3/gp130/G1ERT proliferated in response to TPO and gp130 ligand (gp130L) (in this paper, we denote G-CSF as gp130L when it acts on G-CSFR/gp130), respectively. When these clones were treated with 4-HT for 4 days, GATA-1 suppressed TPO-dependent growth by 70%, and inhibited gp130L-dependent growth completely (changes in the proportion of S-G2/M phase before and after the 72-h 4-HT treatment in DNA content analysis under the culture with TPO, 57% to 20%; gp130L, 43% to 22% (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the 4-HT treatment induced apoptosis in 39% of Ba/F3/gp130/G1ERT cells cultured with gp130L (apoptotic cells were detected as a sub-diploid fraction in DNA content analysis, Fig. 1D). In contrast, the 4-HT treatment neither influenced TPO-dependent growth/survival of Ba/F3/c-Mpl/Mock nor gp130L-depedent growth/survival of Ba/F3/gp130/Mock (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that GATA-1 can more efficiently affect signaling molecules of TPO and gp130L than those of IL-3. Next, we analyzed whether GATA-2 inhibits TPO- or gp130-dependent growth and survival of Ba/F3 cells as well as GATA-1. We introduced GATA-2/ER (a chimera consisting of full-length GATA-2 and the estrogen receptor, which reveals GATA-2 activity in response to ED (13.Heyworth C. Gale K. Dexter M. May G. Enver T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1847-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)) or a Mock vector into Ba/F3 clones each expressing c-Mpl and G-CSFR/gp130; these clones were designated as Ba/F3/c-Mpl/G2ER, Ba/F3/gp130/G2ER, Ba/F3/c-Mpl/Mock, and Ba/F3/gp130/Mock, respectively. The ED treatment did not influence TPO-dependent growth/survival of Ba/F3/c-Mpl/Mock or gp130L-dependent growth/survival of Ba/F3/gp130/Mock (data not shown). In contrast, ED-activated GATA-2 inhibited both TPO- and gp130L-dependent growth of these clones almost completely (Fig. 1C) (changes in the proportion of S-G2/M phase before and after the 72-h ED treatment: Ba/F3/c-Mpl/G2ER cultured with TPO, 53% to 4%; Ba/F3/gp130/G2ER cultured with gp130L, 40% to 3%) (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the ED treatment induced severe apoptosis in 52% of Ba/F3/gp130/G2ER cells under the culture with gp130L (Fig. 1D). Effects of GATA Transcription Factors on STAT Activity— STATs have been reported to mediate cytokine-dependent growth and survival of hematopoietic cells (15.Levy D.E. Darnell. Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar, 17.Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukada T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Exp.

Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Particularly, STAT3 was shown to be crucial for gp130L-depednent growth and survival of Ba/F3 cells (17.Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukada T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 18.Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effects of GATA-1 and GATA-2 on STAT3 and STAT5 activities, we examined the expression their target molecules during the 4-HT or ED treatment in Ba/F3/gp130/G1ERT, Ba/F3/gp130/G2ER, and Ba/F3/gp130/Mock by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, time course analyses demonstrated that both 4-HT treatment, and ED treatment suppressed the expression of target molecules for STAT3 (c-myc, JunB, and SOCS1) to an undetectable level under the culture with gp130L in Ba/F3/gp130/G1ERT and Ba/F3/gp130/G2ER, whereas these treatments did not affect their expression in Ba/F3/gp130/Mock (data not shown). In contrast, neither the 4-HT treatment nor ED treatment influenced the expression of target molecules for STAT5 (CIS and Pim-1) under the culture with IL-3 in Ba/F3/gp130/G1ERT, Ba/F3/gp130/G2ER (Fig. 2A) and Ba/F3/gp130/Mock (data not shown). After deprivation of gp130L for 12 h, we stimulated these clones with gp130L or IL-3 for 30 min and investigated induction levels of these target molecules. As shown in Fig. 2B, upper left panel, the induction of target molecules for STAT3 (Jun B, SOCS1, and Tis11) by gp130L was severely inhibited by the 2-h pretreatment with 4-HT in Ba/F3/gp130/G1ERT but not in Ba/F3/gp130/Mock. Also, the ED pretreatment suppressed their induction by gp130L in Ba/F3/gp130/G2ER but not in Ba/F3/gp130/Mock (Fig. 2B, lower left panel). In contrast, the induction of target molecules for STAT5 (CIS, OSM, and Pim-1) by IL-3 was hardly affected by these pretreatments in Ba/F3/gp130/G1ERT and Ba/F3/gp130/G2ER (Fig. 2B, right panels), and Ba/F3/gp130/Mock (data not shown). To further analyze the effects of GATA transcription factors on STAT activities, we performed luciferase assays with reporter genes for STAT3 (4 × APRE-Luc) and STAT5 (3 × β-Cas-Luc) (26.Matsumura I. Nakajima K. Wakao H. Hattori S. Hashimoto K. Sugahara H. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Hirano T. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in NIH3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, WT GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 inhibited STAT3-C (constitutively active STAT3)-induced 4 × APRE-Luc activities with similar efficiencies. By contrast, none of GATA-1, GATA-2, or GATA-3 affected 1*6-STAT5A (constitutively active STAT5A)-induced 3 × β-Cas-Luc activities. These results suggest that GATA transcription factors would specifically suppress activity of STAT3 but not of STAT5. GATA-1 Inhibits DNA-binding Activity of STAT3 but Not of STAT5—To clarify the mechanism through which GATA-1 and GATA-2 inhibit STAT3 activity, we examined the effects of GATA-1 and GATA-2 on gp130L-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. However, neither 4-HT-activated GATA-1 nor ED-activated GATA-2 influenced gp130L-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in Ba/F3/gp130/G1ERT and Ba/F3/gp130/G2ER (data not shown). So, we next examined the effects of GATA-1 and GATA-2 on DNA-binding activity of STAT3 by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. After deprivation of gp130L for 12 h, we stimulated Ba/F3/gp130/G1ERT and Ba/F3/gp130/Mock with gp130L or IL-3 for 30 min with or without the 4-HT pretreatment. Without the pretreatment, the nuclear extract isolated after the stimulation with gp130L bound to the probe for STAT3 (Fig. 3A, upper left panel, lane 2). This complex was abolished by the WT competitor but not by the mutated (MT) competitor, and was supershifted by the anti-STAT3 Ab, indicating that this complex was formed from STAT3 (Fig. 3A, upper left panel, lanes 3–5). The 4-HT pretreatment drastically suppressed DNA-binding activity of STAT3 in Ba/F3/gp130/G1ERT (Fig. 3A, upper left panel, lane 2 versus lane 7), whereas the 4-HT pretreatment by itself showed no effect on its DNA binding in Ba/F3/gp130/Mock (Fig. 3A, lower left panel). In contrast, IL-3-induced DNA-binding activity of STAT5 was scarcely influe"

The T-loop of cdk2 contains a regulatory phosphorylation site at Thr160. An interaction between cdc-associated phosphatase (KAP) and cdk2 compromises the interaction between cdk2 and cyclin A, which permits access of KAP, a Thr160-directed phosphatase, to its substrate, cdk2. We have reported that KAP is bound and activated by a nuclear membrane protein, HTm4. Here, we present in vitro data showing the direct interaction between the HTm4 C terminus and KAP Tyr141. We show that this interaction not only facilitates access of KAP to Thr160 and accelerates KAP kinetics, but also forces exclusion of cyclin A from the KAP·cdk2 complex.

HTm4 (MS4A3) is the third member of subfamily A in an extensive membrane-spanning four-domain gene family. These genes are only loosely related at the sequence level, but their encoded proteins share a common four-transmembrane topology, including CD20 (MS4A1) and FcϵRI (MS4A2). To date, few functions for the MS4 family of proteins have been ascribed. However, a diverse functionality is beginning to emerge. These functions include roles such as cell surface signaling receptors and intracellular adapter proteins (1Ishibashi K. Suzuki M. Sasaki S. Imai M.

Cell cycle progression is regulated by the sequential activation, and inactivation, of the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; KAP, cdk-associated phosphatase; p-cdk2, phosphorylated cdk2; PDB, Protein Data Bank; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; RU, resonance units. 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; KAP, cdk-associated phosphatase; p-cdk2, phosphorylated cdk2; PDB, Protein Data Bank; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; RU, resonance units. Cdks, themselves, are substrates for regulatory phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The phosphorylation status of cdks is controlled by a discrete class of regulatory kinases and phosphatases (6Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). Cdk activity is controlled by activatory and inhibitory proteins, the latter exemplified by p21 and p27. Binding of inhibitors such as p21 and p27 to different cyclin·cdk complexes is sufficient to arrest the cell cycle (7Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J.

Uchimaru K. Asano S. Fujita T. Nakahata T. Motokura T. Blood. 1999; 93: 4167-4178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, inactive, monomeric cdk can be activated via association with a specific cyclin and the concurrent phosphorylation of a conserved and essential threonine residue, such as threonine 160 (Thr160) in cdk2, which is located within the activation segment (T-loop) of the kinase. In addition to cyclin association, full activation of cdk2 requires phosphorylation of Thr160 and dephosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15. Thr160 of cdk2 is phosphorylated by CAK (cdk-associated kinase), whereas its dephosphorylation is critical for inactivation. This dephosphorylation is executed by a serine/threonine-directed phosphatase, KAP. It has been shown that exogenous expression of KAP slows the G1 phase cell cycle progression in HeLa cells and that aberrant KAP transcripts are detected in some hepatocellular carcinomas (13Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Fang L. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Yeh C.T. Lu S.C. Chao C.H. Chao M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that KAP has the same biological effects as cdk inhibitors, although their modes of actions are different. KAP can bind to cdk2 either in the presence or absence of cyclins (15Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 16Poon R.Y. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Hannon G.J. Casso D. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, KAP can only dephosphorylate cdk2 when cyclin A is degraded or disassociated, in a mechanism that may control access of KAP to its substrate Thr160 (16Poon R.Y. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Cyclin binding may therefore control access of KAP to its substrate phosphothreonine 160. We reported previously that HTm4 interacts directly with the KAP via its C terminus (18Donato J.L. Ko J. Kutok J.L. Cheng T. Shirakawa T. Mao X.Q. Beach D. Scadden D.T. Sayegh M.H. Adra C.N. J. Clin.

Histology. 2004; 36: 77-87Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and that exogenous expression of HTm4 leads to dephosphorylation of cdk2 and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Here, we show that the presence of HTm4 in the KAP·cdk2·cyclin A complex controls cdk2 activity in a dual fashion. First, HTm4 binding causes exclusion of cyclin A from its interaction with cdk2. Second, HTm4 binding potentiates KAP enzymatic activity and causes conformational changes that regulate access to Thr160. Subcloning, Expression, Purification, and Characterization of HTm4 and KAP—Human HTm4 was reverse transcribed-PCR cloned from total RNA extracted from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers with informed consent, using the following 5′- and 3′-primers (forward primer: hHTm4BamH1: 5′-cgc-gga-tcc-ggc-tct-gga-tct-gga-tct-ggt-atc-gag-gga-agg-atg-gcc-tcc-cac-gaa-gtt-3′; reverse primer: hHTm4Pst1: 5′-gca-ctg-cag-tta-ttg-att-aca-cag-aat-tgg-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into the pQE-80L vector (Qiagen). An N-terminal His tag was conferred during subcloning. Recombinant HTm4 was purified from transformed JM109 Escherichia coli as follows. Protein production was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to bacterial liquid culture in logarithmic phase. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 30 min. The bacterial pellet was lysed by sonication on ice (20 KW, 15 min) in 50 ml of N buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 20 × 104 g at 4 °C for 30 min. The remaining pellet was lysed in 40 ml of N buffer containing 6 m guanidine HCl. Proteins were bound to a 20-ml nickel-chelated Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and were refolded by exposure to a 6–0 m urea gradient at 0.2 ml/min. The refolded protein sample was eluted with a gradient of N buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole and 0.3% deoxycholate. The peak fraction containing HTm4 was collected and purified by XArrest agarose after His tag cleavage with 4 units of Factor Xa (Novagen). Wild-type KAP, inactive KAP (C140S), and mutant KAP were expressed and purified as described previously (20Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Western Blotting of HTm4 —For the Western blot, 10 μl of purified protein was boiled in SDS sample buffer and resolved by 15% PAGE. After electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride, the membrane (Bio-Rad) was blocked followed by either incubation with either anti-His tag antibody diluted at 1:5,000 (MBL) or anti-HTm4 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Signals were detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Interaction Analyses (Surface Plasmon Resonance Assay)— The immobilization of proteins to sensor chips (CM-5 chip) was performed using a carbodiimide covalent linkage protocol (Amersham Biosciences). KAP was coupled to the sensor chip at 2,800 resonance units (RU). Nonspecific human immunoglobin was coupled to the surface of the sensor chip (anti-β2m antibody BBM.1) at 2,900 RU. Protein interaction assays were carried out using the BioSensor Biacore 2000 (Biacore). An HTm4 C-terminal peptide composed of 22 amino acids (CNANCCNSREEISSPPNSV) was synthesized. Either full-length HTm4 protein (20 μm), or HTm4 C-terminal peptide (1 mm) in 50 mm HEPES containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% Tween 20 was examined at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Protein Activity Assays—KAP phosphatase activity was examined by the detection of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (WAKO) as described previously (20Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The time course of phosphatase activity for KAP was examined. 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm pNPP, 40 μm KAP, 4 μm cdk·cyclin A (Upstate Biotechnology), and 20 μm HTm4 was incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times. The reaction was halted by the addition of 0.1 m NaOH. The phosphatase activity in 5 μl of each sample was measured as A410. To investigate the effect of HTm4 on KAP, KAP phosphatase activity was assessed with different HTm4 concentrations in the presence of pNPP. Reaction velocity was measured in the presence of 0.0025–20 μm HTm4. All reaction mixtures contained 40 μm KAP and 4 μm active cdk2·cyclin A. Activities of either wild-type or C140S (inactive) KAP were examined in the different reaction mixtures: with or without 20 μm HTm4 (C-terminal peptides/nonrelated peptides at 0.1 mm) or 4 μm active cdk·cyclin A (cdk2 monomer). Kinetic Measurements—To investigate the effect of HTm4 on KAP, the initial reaction velocity of KAP was assessed using different concentrations of active cdk2·cyclin A as the substrate in the presence or absence of HTm4. The results were analyzed further using a Lineweaver-Burk plot. KAP Dephosphorylation of Peptide or Protein Substrates—KAP dephosphorylation of phosphorylated proteins or peptide substrates was examined using the Ser/Thr Phosphatase Assay Kit 1 (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphorylated Thr160 of cdk2 and K-R-pT-I-R-R peptide were used as substrates for the assay. Concentrations of KAP and HTm4 were both 20 μm; concentrations of p-cdk2 and peptide substrates (K-R-pT-I-R-R) were 10 and 25 μm, respectively. Reactions were performed in pNPP Ser/Thr Assay Buffer, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 100 μm CaCl2. To examine the importance of the HTm4 C-terminal region and to confirm the KAP phosphatase activity enhancement effect of HTm4, an HTm4 C-terminal peptide composed of 22 amino acids (CNANCCNSREEISSPPNSV) was synthesized. The phosphatase enhancement activity of the HTm4 C-terminal region was examined using the assay protocol described above. All assays were performed in triplicate, with the average values and standard deviations displayed on the plot (see Figs. 2 and 3).Fig. 3HTm4 enhances KAP phosphatase activity.a, kinetics of wild-type KAP phosphatase activity. 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm pNPP, 40 μm KAP, 4 μm cdk2·cyclin A, and 20 μm HTm4 was incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times. The reaction was halted by the addition of 0.1 m NaOH. The phosphatase activity in 5 μl of each sample was measured at 410 nm. b, the presence of HTm4 linearly increases KAP phosphatase activity. KAP phosphatase activity was assessed in the presence of increasing amounts of HTm4 using pNPP as the KAP substrate. The reaction velocity was measured in the presence of 0.0025–20 μm HTm4. All reaction mixtures contained 40 μm KAP and 4 μm active cdk2·cyclin A. Reactions were repeated in triplicate. Their average values and standard deviations are shown. c, Lineweaver-Burk Plot. KAP phosphatase activity was assessed using the Ser/Thr Assay Kit 1 with different concentrations of active cdk2·cyclin A (from 4 to 20 μm) as the substrate in the presence or absence of 40 μm HTm4. Vmax and Km for the samples in the presence and absence of HTm4 are 17.5, 1.30 nm/min, and 8.33, 2.68 μm, respectively. d, Dixon Plot. KAP phosphatase activity was assessed using the Ser/Thr Assay Kit 1 with different concentrations of active cdk2·cyclin A (from 4 to 20 μm) as the substrate in the presence or absence of 40 μm HTm4. e, effects of HTm4 on KAP phosphatase activity toward pNPP substrate. Activities of either wild-type (WT) or C140S inactive mutant KAP were examined in the different reaction mixtures, with or without 20 μm HTm4 (its C-terminal peptides/nonrelated peptides at 0.1 mm) or with 4 μm active cdk2·cyclin A (cdk2 monomer). f, effects of HTm4 on KAP phosphatase activity with phosphorylated cdk2 or cdk2-derived peptide as its substrate. Phosphorylated threonine 160 from cdk2·cyclin A, active, and phosphopeptide (K-R-pT-I-R-R) were used as substrates to assess KAP activity. Assays were performed using the Ser/Thr Phosphatase Assay Kit 1. Concentrations of KAP and HTm4 were both 20 μm, and concentrations of p-cdk2 and peptide (K-R-pT-I-R-R) were 10 and 25 μm, respectively. Reactions were made in the pNPP Ser/Thr Assay Buffer, which contains 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 100 μm CaCl2. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C, and absorbance was measured at 650 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopic measurements were performed on a Jasco J-700 (Jasco, Japan). Spectra measurements were recorded from 250 to 320 nm. The spectra change of KAP was measured by comparing two different KAP samples in the same solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl). Sample A contained 5 μm KAP and an excess amount of HTm4 C-peptide (50 μm). The contents of sample B were identical to those in sample A, except for HTm4 C-peptide. The difference in spectra was further converted to parameter (mean residue ellipticity) and plotted on the graph in Fig. 4. Cyclin A Dissociation Assay—The status of the cdk2·cyclin A complex was examined in the presence and absence of HTm4. Recombinant cdk2·cyclin A (Upstate) and His-tagged KAP were combined in vitro and incubated in the absence or presence of either 1 or 10 μm HTm4. The samples were added to a nickel magnet bead matrix (Toyobo) to capture His-tagged KAP protein and any associated binding partners. The bound fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for the presence of cyclin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). An alkaline phosphatase conjugated to anti-rabbit IgG (EY Laboratory) was used to visualize the amount of bound cyclin A present in the KAP·cdk2 complex. 10 μl of 10 μm cdk2·cyclin A and 10 μl of 10 μm His-tagged KAP were mixed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Tween 20. After incubating at room temperature for 5 min, either 10 μlof10 μm HTm4 (without His tag) or its buffer was added to the reaction mixture. After incubating at room temperature for 5 min, 5 μl of nickel magnet beads was added to each mixture. The fractions bound to His-tagged KAP were washed with the reaction buffer and boiled for SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with a silver staining kit (ATTO). Direct Binding of KAP and HTm4 in Vitro—We have shown previously that HTm4 and KAP phosphatase may be coimmunoprecipitated from hematopoietic cells (18Donato J.L. Ko J. Kutok J.L. Cheng T. Shirakawa T. Mao X.Q. Beach D. Scadden D.T. Sayegh M.H. Adra C.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because these data form the basis for a novel model where HTm4 is a component of the cell cycle machinery, it is important that we determine whether the interaction is direct or if it involves an intermediary protein. We have since established a purified protein-protein interaction system that allows us to examine whether HTm4 and KAP interact directly. His-tagged HTm4 was produced in E. coli and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (Fig. 1a). The eluted peak corresponding to HTm4 was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1b) and then analyzed by Western blot. Both anti-HTm4 and anti-His antibodies detected a 27-kDa band corresponding to HTm4 (Fig. 1, c and d). Surface plasmon resonance was used to detect direct binding of purified HTm4 to KAP. Full-length KAP protein was coupled to a sensor chip CM-5 shell (Amersham Biosciences). Compared with either uncoupled or nonspecifically coupled chips (coupled to anti-β2m antibody BBM.1), an immediate increase in mass was observed when either full-length HTm4 (Fig. 2a) or a C-terminal peptide from HTm4 (Fig. 2b) was passed over KAP-coupled sensor chips. Moreover, premixing HTm4 with KAP abolished the KAP/HTm4 selective binding (data not shown). These in vitro data confirm that HTm4 and KAP interact directly and that the HTm4 C terminus is necessary and sufficient to mediate binding to KAP. KAP Phosphatase Activity Is Enhanced in the Presence of HTm4 —HTm4 is a direct binding partner for KAP, as shown in our previous yeast two-hybrid data. We hypothesize that HTm4 may regulate the enzymic activity of the KAP phosphatase. In the current experiment, KAP phosphatase activity was measured using pNPP as a generic substrate for KAP. In the presence of HTm4 and the cdk2·cyclin A-binding complex, a biphasic kinetic for KAP activity was observed. As shown in Fig. 3a, after the addition of pNPP substrate, an exponential phase (in the first 20 min) was followed by a plateau phase (after 30 min). The presence of HTm4 linearly increased the phosphatase activity of KAP (y = 1.45x + 0.01; r2 = 0.98) (Fig. 3b). Without HTm4, the Vmax and Km for KAP phosphatase activity were 1.30 nm/min and 2.68 μm, respectively (Fig. 3, c and d). However, when HTm4 was present, the Vmax of KAP phosphatase activity increased dramatically to 17.5 nm/min. A parallel increase in Km (to 8.33 μm) was also observed. Taken together, these data suggest that the presence of HTm4 directly affects the activity of the KAP phosphatase. KAP Dephosphorylation of Peptide or Protein Substrates— KAP dephosphorylation of phosphorylated proteins or peptide substrates was examined using the Ser/Thr Phosphatase Assay Kit 1 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphorylated Thr160 of cdk2 (p-cdk2) and K-R-pT-I-R-R peptides were used as substrates for the assay. Concentrations of KAP and HTm4 were both 20 μm; concentrations of p-cdk2 and peptide substrates (K-R-pT-I-R-R) were 10 and 25 μm, respectively. Reactions were performed in pNPP Ser/Thr Assay Buffer, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 100 μm CaCl2. To examine the necessity of the HTm4 C-terminal region and to confirm the KAP phosphatase activity enhancement effect of HTm4, a peptide containing the last 22 amino acids of the HTm4 C terminus (CNANCCNSREEISSPPNSV) was synthesized. The phosphatase enhancement activity of the HTm4 C-terminal region was examined using the assay protocol described above. All assays were performed in triplicate, with the average values and standard deviations displayed on the plot. We further evaluated the major factors affecting KAP phosphatase activity. As we have shown, KAP phosphatase activity is significantly enhanced in the presence of HTm4. When an inactive KAP mutant (C140S) is substituted for the wild-type KAP, the phosphatase activity is almost completely abolished. The inactive KAP mutant thus serves as a negative control (15Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 20Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We found that when HTm4 was absent or was replaced with a nonrelated peptide, KAP phosphatase activity was almost completely inhibited compared with control reactions containing wild-type KAP, HTm4, and cdk2·cyclin A complex (Fig. 3e). It is interesting to note that a cdk2·cyclin A complex, rather than either a monomeric cdk2 or cyclin A, was required for a stronger KAP phosphatase activity induced by HTm4. Additionally, our data suggest that KAP activity is optimal in the context of a multicomponent protein complex that contains its substrate, cdk2, and the HTm4 protein. Our data demonstrate that wild-type KAP and HTm4 are essential for KAP phosphatase activity. Based on our previous yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation data, we aimed to confirm whether the C-terminal region of HTm4, alone, was sufficient to mediate the HTm4-KAP interaction and to induce the KAP phosphatase activity. To this end, we utilized the same synthesized peptide containing the hypothesized KAP binding domain (CNANCCNSREEISSPPNSV), as described above. When introduced into our in vitro KAP activity assay, the HTm4 C-peptide showed a comparable enhancement effect on KAP phosphatase activity compared with HTm4 wild-type protein (Fig. 3e). These data both confirm our previous observation that the C terminus of HTm4 mediates direct binding of HTm4 to KAP and show that the C terminus is the functional domain of HTm4 which regulates KAP activity. HTm4 Controls the Phosphatase Activity of KAP toward Its Physiological Substrates—The data presented above demonstrate that HTm4 enhances the activity of the KAP phosphatase toward a generic substrate compound, pNPP. We asked whether HTm4 could also modify the activity of KAP toward its physiological substrates. We evaluated the ability of KAP to dephosphorylate two of its substrates (Fig. 3f). First, we examined cdk2 with a phosphorylated Thr160 (p-cdk2), which acts as a natural substrate for KAP. We then used a synthesized threonine phosphopeptide, K-R-pT-I-R-R (Upstate). We found that HTm4 increases the dephosphorylating activity of KAP toward phosphorylated cdk2 by more than 6-fold, when cdk2 is presented in the context of the cdk2·cyclin A complex. We also demonstrated that HTm4 potentiates dephosphorylation of the synthesized phosphopeptide K-R-pT-I-R-R. However, no KAP dephosphorylation activity could be detected if HTm4 was not presented. Interestingly, no dephosphorylation effect was observed when phosphorylated cdk2 was presented in the cdk2·cyclin A-binding complex. These data imply that the presence of HTm4 confers a substrate-specific enhancement of KAP phosphatase activity. Structural Change of KAP by Adding C-peptide of HTm4 — Based on our observation that C-peptide of HTm4 protein enhanced KAP activity, we hypothesized that the binding of HTm4 C-peptide to the KAP molecule induced KAP conformational change. To confirm this hypothesis, we examined conformational changes of KAP in the presence or absence of the C-peptide by using CD spectroscopy. The CD spectrum of a protein in the “near-ultraviolet” spectral region (250–350 nm) can be sensitive to certain aspects of tertiary structure. At these wavelengths the chromophores are the aromatic amino acids and disulfide bonds, and the CD signals they produce are sensitive to the overall tertiary structure of the protein. Signals in the region from 250 to 270 nm are attributable to phenylalanine residues, signals from 270 to 290 nm are attributable to tyrosine, and those from 280 to 300 nm are attributable to tryptophan. Disulfide bones give rise to broad weak signals throughout the near-ultraviolet spectrum. As shown in Fig. 4, we found a spectral change at 270–280 nm in the difference spectrum of KAP between sample A (with HTm4 C-peptide) and sample B (without C-peptide). The 270–290 nm difference spectrum demonstrated a conformational change in tyrosine when HTm4 C-peptide was added into KAP solution. Because HTm4 C-peptide has no tyrosines residues, this major change in the spectrum must be caused by conformational changes in the KAP tyrosine residues. Hence, this result demonstrated that HTm4 could cause direct conformational/tertiary structural change in KAP after its binding to KAP by the C terminus. HTm4 Dissociates Inhibitory Cyclin A from the cdk2·cyclin A-binding Complex—The activity of cdk2 is controlled by its protein-protein interactions with KAP and cyclin A. The binding of KAP phosphatase to the cdk2·cyclin A complex dephosphorylates, and hence inactivates, cdk2. However, the binding of cyclin A inhibits the ability of KAP to dephosphorylate cdk2. Dissociation of cyclin A by HTm4 facilitates cdk2 dephosphorylation by KAP. Interestingly, HTm4 enhances the KAP dephosphorylation effect even on phosphorylated cdk2 that is presented in a complex with cyclin A. This result suggests that HTm4 may facilitate cdk2 inactivation by alleviating the inhibitory effect of cyclin A. Our model suggests that HTm4 may dually regulate cdk2 activity, via KAP, and by physically excluding cyclin A from its inhibitory interaction with cdk2. To verify our hypothesis, we used an affinity purification method to evaluate the cdk2-cyclin A interaction both with and without HTm4. We isolated His-tagged KAP protein using a Ni2+ binding column. Without HTm4, cyclin A remained in the His-purified KAP·cdk2·cyclin A-binding complex (Fig. 5a). However, when purified HTm4 (after His tag cleavage) was added to the KAP·cdk2·cyclin A reaction mixture, cyclin A dissociated from the complex in a dose-dependent manner, and the remaining protein complex was found to contain only KAP·cdk2·HTm4 (Fig. 5b). These observations demonstrate that HTm4 inactivates cdk2 by activating KAP and by causing concomitant dissociation of cyclin A from cdk2. Together with the observation that HTm4 enhances KAP phosphatase activity, we suggest that HTm4 is positioned as a key regulator in the activation of KAP and for cdk2 activity. Mechanism for HTm4-induced Dissociation of Cyclin A from Cdk2·Cyclin A—In silico modeling was used to probe the potential nature of the HTm4 regulatory interaction that promotes KAP phosphatase activity and potentially leads to the exclusion of cyclin A. Based on our findings, we show that KAP undergoes conformational changes following allosteric binding to the HTm4 C-terminal domain and that these conformational changes may subsequently facilitate the interaction between the KAP substrate and its active site. To examine this hypothetical model, we produced a steric structure model using the coordinates of cdk2·cyclin A (1JST) (21Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and cdk·KAP (1FQ1) (20Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). These structures were overlapped utilizing Homology in Insight II software (MSI). The resulting model complex is shown in Fig. 6a. Both cdk structures significantly overlap, and the overall RMS deviation is 0.92 Å, with the exception of the T-loop region. In this region, marked differences in cdk structure can be noted, depending on whether coordinates are derived from the cdk2·cyclin A (blue loop) or the cdk2·KAP complex (red loop). There is a deep concave face, as shown in Fig. 6b. We hypothesize that the concave face forms a potential docking site for the HTm4 C terminus. On the reverse side of the interface, phosphothreonine 160 of cdk2 can be inserted into the entrance of the active site of KAP in the absence of cyclin A, whereas a small molecule of substrate such as pNPP may still be able to enter the entrance even in the presence of cyclin A. This finding may explain why KAP activity toward pNPP is enhanced at moderate levels in the presence of the cdk2·cyclin A complex. Mode of Structural Change of the Cdk2 T-loop in the Absence and Presence of HTm4 —The T-loop is a conserved segment in cdks, which plays an important role in cdk activation. In the cdk2·cyclin A complex, phosphorylation is associated with the mobility of the T-loop (12Taniguchi T. Endo H. Chikatsu N. Uchimaru K. Asano S. Fujita T. Nakahata T. Motokura T. Blood. 1999; 93: 4167-4178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, viral cyclins (K-, H-cyclins) can still activate cdk6 without Thr177 phosphorylation, which corresponds to Thr160 phosphorylation in cdk2. The degree of interaction between the T-loop of cdk6 and V-cyclin is shown to be critical because the interaction area between cdk6 and V-cyclin was 20% larger than that of cdk2 and cyclin A (15Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). This increased interaction is contributed mainly by the T-loop of cdk6. Hence, the movement of the T-loop is critical for cdk activation. In the cdk2·cyclin A activation model, van der Waals interactions exists between Ala151, Phe152, and Tyr159 of the cdk2 T-loop and Phe267, Ile182, and Ile270 of cyclin A (Fig. 7a) (6Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). However, in our KAP·cdk2·cyclin A complex model, the second cdk2-cyclin A interaction (Phe152-Ile182) is completely abolished if the T-loop is moved because of the interaction of KAP (Fig. 7b). This result demonstrates that binding of KAP to cdk2 weakens the interactions between cdk2 and cyclin A. Moreover, it is reported that interactions between the T-loop of cdk2 and KAP comprise van der Waals interactions between residues Tyr141 and Phe53 of KAP with residue His161 of cdk2 (20Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Besides the van der Waals interaction between the T-loop of cdk2 and cyclin A, a specific ionic interaction also exists between the -NH at Arg157 of cdk2 and the -OH of Glu268 of cyclin A in cdk2·cyclin A complex. This interaction disappears when the cyclin A molecule is dissociated, as seen in the cdk2·KAP complex (Fig. 8a). Thus, the extension of the T-loop in cdk2·cyclin A (blue) is inhibited by this ionic interaction. In PDB models, more than 20 sets of coordinates are deposited for cdk2, both with and without cyclin A or its inhibitors. We investigated each structure of the T-loop and measured dihedral angles between Val154 and Pro155, which are conserved in several cdks. Fig. 8b shows amino acid multialignments for several cdks. When cdk2 is associated with cyclin A, the T-loop is shortened with cis-Pro at position 155. Conversely, without cyclin A, the loop is extended with trans-Pro (Table I). When bound to KAP (without cyclin A), the T-loop of cdk2 shows extension in the trans form. According to the predicted crystal structure of cdk2·cyclin A, this cis-trans conversion at Pro155 is thought to occur automatically because the residue Pro155 would no longer be accessible to an isomerase (Fig. 8c).Table Iω Angles between Val154 and Pro155 in the T-loop of cdk2 from the PDBPDB codeω (Degree)TLaTL, T-loop; E, extended; S, shortened.Cyclin A/KAP1JSU-13.76cisE(+)/(-)1JST5.87cisE(+)/(-)1E9H0.06cisE(+)/(-)1H286.61cisE(+)/(-)1QMZ36.92cisE(+)/(-)1FQ1175.31transS(-)/(+)1HCK170.27transS(-)/(-)1PF8166.29transS(-)/(-)1PW2177.23transS(-)/(-)a TL, T-loop; E, extended; S, shortened. Open table in a new tab When cyclin A dissociates from cdk2, the T-loop will extend through cis-trans conversion at the Pro155 residue, and phosphothreonine 160 can then be inserted into the active site of KAP. Thus, the susceptibility of phosphothreonine 160 to KAP phosphatase occurs in response to HTm4 binding to KAP. Pro155 commonly exists in cdk3, cdk5, but not cdk4, cdk5 as shown in Fig. 8b, whereas its counterpart residue Glu258 is conserved in cyclins A, B, E, and C but not in cyclin D. This disparity suggests that mechanisms for cdk inactivation by KAP may differ between cdk species and hence between different phases of the cell cycle. Binding Site of HTm4 —In Fig. 8d, we show the close allosteric position between Thr160 of cdk2 and Tyr84, Tyr141 of KAP, which suggests that the concave face of KAP accepts the HTm4 C terminus via the Tyr141 residue of KAP. Immediately following HTm4 binding, the conformational change of the Tyr141 residue of (Fig. 4) will weaken the van der Waals interaction between cdk2 and cyclin A and then affect continuously alongside T-loop (from residues 142 to 165) involving Ala151, Phe152, and Tyr159. This HTm4 binding eventually dissociates cyclin A from cdk2, thereby inducing a structural change of cdk2. At the reverse side of the interface, phosphothreonine 160 of cdk2 is inserted into the entrance of the active site of KAP, after cyclin A is released. Model of Action Mechanism for HTm4 —HTm4 has four transmembrane domains (22Adra C.N. Lelias J.M. Kobayashi H. Kaghad M. Morrison P. Rowley J.D. Lim B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10178-10182Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Topologically, this structure provides two tails that are available for protein-protein interactions (2Liang Y. Buckley T.R. Tu L. Langdon S.D. Tedder T.F. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). HTm4 localizes to the nuclear membrane. We hypothesize that the tails of HTm4 extend into the nuclear lumen and tether the KAP·cdk2·cyclin A complex (Fig. 9). The interaction between HTm4 and the KAP·cdk2·cyclin A complex is likely reversible and may occur only at certain stages in the cell cycle. HTm4 significantly affects the activity of KAP, cdk2, and cyclin A. HTm4 also regulates cdk2 activity in a dual fashion, by concurrently activating KAP activity and facilitating the accessibility of Thr160 to KAP by causing dissociation of inhibitory cyclin A (Fig. 9). In conclusion, we show that HTm4 regulates the cell cycle in hematopoietic cells through its ability to control cdk2 status. We thank Prof. D. Kohda and Dr. K.

The physical interaction between CN and NFATs is an essential step in the activation of NFAT-dependent genes by calcium signals. Using deletional and substitutional analyses, we have identified a 13-amino acid region within CN that is essential for the interaction with NFAT and with two other CN-binding proteins, AKAP79 and Cabin-1. The interaction of CN with these proteins is selectively disrupted by substitution of specific amino acid residues within this region, indicating that NFAT and other CN-interacting proteins bind differentially to CN.

CN is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic/calmodulin-binding subunit, calcineurin A (CnA), which is tightly bound to a calcium-binding regulatory subunit, calcineurin B (CnB). Studies in gene-targeted mice have shown CN to be important in the regulation of developmental processes such as the patterning of the vascular system and the cardiac and skeletal muscle growth. In adults, CN plays an essential role in the activation of T cells. All these events are controlled by the tight binding and regulation of transcription factors of the NFAT family (3Crabtree G.R.

This family of transcription factors comprises five members, and four of them, named NFATc1–NFATc4 (HUGO nomenclature) are regulated by CN, which dephosphorylates them to promote nuclear translocation and subsequent NFAT-dependent gene expression (5Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). The CN/NFAT signaling pathway is the target of the immunosuppressive actions of cyclosporin A and FK506. These drugs, once bound to their cellular partners, block the active site of CN, inhibiting its phosphatase activity (6Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R.

However, treatment with these immunosuppressants is associated with severe side effects that are thought to be mediated through the inhibition of CN substrates other than NFATs (8Kiani A. Rao A.

The amount of purified GST protein was confirmed by running on an SDS-PAGE gel followed by Coomassie staining. Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Cell Extracts—HEK-293 and HeLa cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium supplemented with l-glutamine plus antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). The HEK transient transfections were performed by the modified calcium phosphate method (10Rodriguez A. Flemington E.K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfected cells were washed with PBS, scraped from plates, and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. Cells were then lysed by adding 100 μl of either binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100) for FLAG-tagged transfections or 1 mm CaCl2 supplemented 1% Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, and 1% Triton X-100) for NFAT transfections. For NFAT dephosphorylation analysis, transfected cells were lysed with high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100). Lysis was completed by incubation with agitation for 15 min at 4 °C. Soluble proteins were collected by centrifugation at high speed for 15 min at 4 °C, transferred to clean tubes, and frozen immediately. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Analysis—Transfected HeLa and HEK-293 cells plated onto coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS with 4% saccharose for 10 min at room temperature. They were then washed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were incubated in blocking buffer (10% bovine serum albumin [BSA] in PBS) for 20 min, followed by 1-h incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-NFATc2 antiserum (672) or 1:750 dilution of M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody in blocking buffer. The subcellular localizations of NFATc2 and exogenous CnA were visualized by confocal analysis (Radiance 2100, Bio-Rad) after incubation with 1:1000 diluted goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa 488 and 1:1000 diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). Pull-down Experiments—GST fusion proteins were employed as baits in pull-down experiments. The GST-containing beads were washed with binding buffer and incubated for 30 min rocking at 4 °C in 60 μl of lysates of HEK cells transfected with FLAG-tagged hCnAα constructs. Beads were then washed five times with 60 μl of binding buffer, and the bound protein was eluted by boiling samples for 10 min in the presence of 1× Laemli buffer. Samples were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the proteins were detected by Western blotting. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—Transfected HEK-293 cells were lysed with calcium-depleted binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100), and FLAG-tagged proteins were purified from 100-μl extracts by adding 10 μl of preequilibrated FLAG-agarose beads with 0.2% BSA-containing binding buffer described above and incubating with rocking for 1h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and washed five times with binding buffer, and the bound proteins analyzed by Western blotting after loading and running the samples on SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting—Laemmli buffer was added to samples up to 1×, and samples were boiled for 10 min and separated by electrophoresis under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE (6% for NFATc2 protein or 10% for FLAG-tagged or GFP proteins). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then incubated in blocking solution (5% (w/v) skimmed milk in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS), membranes were incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (0.05% (v/v)) in PBS-T with 1% BSA or the rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP serum (0.1% (v/v)) in PBS-T with 5% skimmed milk for 2 h. Membranes were then washed three times for 5 min each with PBS-T, incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) or anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS-T and once with H2O. To detect FLAG-tagged proteins, membranes were incubated with the mouse monoclonal M5 anti-FLAG antibody (0.05% (v/v)) in TBS-T (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times for 2 min each with TBS-T, and incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were washed six times for 10 min each with TBS-T and once with TBS. Membrane-bound antibody was visualized with the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphatase Activity—The enzymatic activity of the different human CnAα constructs was analyzed with the Biomol green cellular calcineurin assay kit (Biomol) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To identify the region of CN that interacts with NFAT, we generated deletion constructs of the α isoform of human CnA (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1) and expressed them in HEK-293 cells. Only the construct bearing residues 2–389, which conserves the structure of the full-length wild-type protein and encodes a constitutively active isoform (11O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), specifically interacted with the NFATc2-regulatory domain in pull-down experiments (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that amino acid residues 269–389 are necessary for interaction between these two molecules. To test whether this region mediates specific interaction (rather than simply maintaining conformation), we co-expressed residues 267–388 (CnA267–388) with NFATc2 and confirmed their in vivo interaction in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1C). Constitutively active CN bound and dephosphorylated NFATc2, while full-length and CnA267–388 bound to phospho-NFATc2 to the same extent. CnA267–388 contains the carboxyl end of the catalytic domain, the CnB binding domain, and the linker sequence joining them. The x-ray structure of the CN heterodimer (12Griffith J.P. Kim J.L.

Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) indicated that the only accessible amino acids in the 269–389 region lie within the 13-amino acid linker sequence (residues 335–347). Mutational analysis in yeast has shown that three specific residues within the linker region of yeast CnA are necessary for stress-induced CN activity in vivo (14Jiang B. Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18543-18551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although yeasts lack NFATs, these residues are conserved in all known CN sequences, so we analyzed their potential involvement in the interaction between human CnA and NFATc2. We substituted each of these three amino acids (S337P, H339L, and L343S), alone or in combination, within the sequence encoding residues 2–389 of human CnAα. Substituted CnA proteins were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, and cell extracts were pulled down with GST-NFATc2. Mutation of any of these residues abolished the interaction between CnAα and the regulatory domain of NFATc2 (Fig. 2A). Equivalent amounts of wild-type and mutant CN proteins from HEK-293 transfected cell lysates were used in all these pull-down experiments (see supplemental Fig. 2). In addition, the ability of all mutant CnA proteins to bind CnB was similar to that of wild-type CnA protein (data not shown).Fig. 2Role of specific amino acids of the linker sequence for the in vitro binding of CN-interacting proteins and the nuclear translocation of NFATc2.A, three specific amino acid substitutions within the linker sequence of CnA abrogate the in vitro interaction of CN with NFATc2. Amino acid substitutions disrupted the binding of NFATc2 to mutant CnA proteins. Lysates from HEK-293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged CnA proteins harboring single, double, or triple substitutions (S337P, H339L, and L343S as indicated) were analyzed by affinity binding to GST (lane 10) and GST-NFATc2 (lanes 1–9). Bound protein was evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG. B, schematic diagram of the GST-fused sequences of human Cabin-1 and human AKAP79 used. Numbers denote the amino acid positions within the full-length human proteins, and the sequences of the PxIxIT-like motifs are detailed. C, lysates of HEK-293 cells expressing the indicated mutant CnA proteins were employed for pull-down experiments. Binding to GST (lane 1), GST-Cabin 1 (lanes 2–7), and GST-AKAP79 (lanes 8–13) was determined by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG. Same aliquots of HEK transfected cells were employed. D, NFATc2 is not translocated to the nucleus by mutant CN proteins. HeLa cells were transfected with HA-NFATc2 and wild-type FLAG-tagged CnA proteins or those bearing single, double, or triple amino acid substitutions within the linker region. Subcellular localization of transfected NFATc2 (top) and CnA (bottom) proteins are shown. E, amino acid substitutions do not affect the phosphatase activity displayed by constitutively active CnA. The phosphatase activity of lysates from cells expressing the CnA proteins indicated was tested against the RII phosphopeptide, a CN specific substrate. Phosphatase activity (picomole of free phosphate released per minute per microgram of protein loaded) is expressed as the increase above the base line of cells transfected with the empty FLAG vector. The results from one representative experiment are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The only functional CN-interacting sequence present in NFATc2 is the PxIxIT motif (PxIxITc2), present in all CN-regulated NFAT proteins. A number of endogenous CN-binding proteins contain a PxIxIT-like motif within the region that binds to CN (15Dodge K.L. Scott J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Liu J.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We analyzed the interaction of the CnA mutant proteins with the CN-interacting sequence from two of these, Cabin-1 (17Sun L. Youn H.D. Loh C. Stolow M. He W. Liu J.O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and AKAP79 (18Dell'Acqua M.L. Dodge K.L. Tavalin S.J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48796-48802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Only the CnAα protein mutated at position 343 was able to interact with the Cabin-1 and AKAP79 domains as efficiently as was the wild-type CnA sequence (Fig. 2D). The linker region of CN thus appears to be critical in its interaction with these two proteins, and single amino acid substitutions differentially affect the binding of CN to different PxIxIT-containing proteins. To investigate the impact of these amino acid substitutions on the in vivo protein-protein interaction, we analyzed the dephosphorylation and nuclear import of NFAT. We performed Western blots on extracts of cells co-transfected with NFATc2 and the CnA-(2–389) constructs. Constitutively active wild-type CnA-(2–389) dephosphorylated NFATc2, and substitution of more than one of the identified CN-linker amino acids inhibited this (supplemental Fig. 3). This finding was confirmed and extended by immunostaining, which showed that proteins bearing more than one of the amino acid substitutions are unable to translocate NFATc2 to the nucleus (Fig. 2D). To rule out the possibility that double or triple substitutions were affecting the activity of the catalytic core of CnA, we tested the phosphatase activity of these mutant CnA proteins expressed in HEK-293 cells on the commonly used CN-specific substrate RII peptide (19Blumenthal D.K. Takio K. Hansen R.S. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8140-8145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphatase activities of lysates from these cells were even higher than those detected in lysates of cells expressing the wild-type protein (Fig. 2E). The failure of CnA mutants to interact with other CN inhibitors might underlie their high phosphatase activity toward the RII phosphopeptide. To further confirm the role of the CnA linker region in the interaction with NFAT in vivo, we expressed the wild-type linker sequence in the presence of NFATc2 and the constitutively active CN wild-type protein and analyzed the phosphorylation state of NFATc2 by Western blotting. Although single substitutions of CnA had a dramatic impact on the in vitro binding to NFATs, double or triple substitutions were required to block dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFATs in intact cells (Fig. 2D and supplemental data). This is likely to be related to in vivo low affinity interactions due to the higher level of the CnA mutants expressed in transfected cells. To verify the role of the CnA linker region in the interaction with NFATc2, we generated two more constructs by inserting a stop codon right after either the linker region (construct expressing amino acids 2–346) or the catalytic domain (construct containing amino acids 2 to 336; Fig. 3A). These constructs were transfected into HEK-293 cells, and the corresponding cell extracts were employed in pull-down experiments using a GST fusion protein expressing the PxIxITc2 motif as bait (GST-PxIxITc2). Only those constructs containing the linker region were able to interact with the PxIxITc2 motif (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 3). Furthermore, these interactions were specifically inhibited by the addition of the VIVIT peptide (lanes 2 and 4). We further tested whether these constructs were able to interact with NFATc2 in vivo. To this end, HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with the new constructs described above and the NFATc2 expression plasmid. In accordance with the results obtained in vitro, we found that only the constructs containing the linker region (389 and 346) were able to translocate NFATc2 to the nucleus (Fig. 3C, left and middle panels). In contrast, the construct of amino acids 2–336, which does not contain the linker sequence, failed to induce the nuclear translocation of NFATc2 (Fig. 3C, right panels). These results demonstrate the involvement of the linker region of CnAα in the interaction with NFAT in vivo. Finally, we found that the expression of the GFP-linker fusion protein, as well as that of the potent inhibitor GFP-VIVIT (20Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), blocked the phosphatase activity displayed by constitutively active CN, and hence, NFATc2 was maintained in a highly phosphorylated state (Fig. 3D). In this experimental system, the small amount of DNA encoding the constitutively active CN that can be employed was responsible for the incomplete dephosphorylation of NFATc2. This demonstrates that the linker peptide is able to disrupt the NFAT-CN interaction in vivo and suggests that the linker region could also act as a docking site for NFAT. Further experiments will be necessary to confirm this possibility. In this regard, a docking site for the exogenous VIVIT peptide has been recently described as a composite site that involves the β strands 11 and 14 of the catalytic domain of CN (21Li H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1659-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since the structure of activated CN remains to be defined, particularly in the linker region, this sequence could not be considered in the modeling of the complex performed by these authors. Thus, whether the residues within the linker region may also be involved in this interaction cannot be ruled out. However, our in vitro and in vivo experiments clearly demonstrate that the linker region is essential for the CN and NFAT proteins to interact. Since the linker region is required for NFAT binding (Fig. 3B) and the CN constructs employed by Li et al. (21Li H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1659-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) contained this region, the interaction of the PxIxIT sequence with the reported docking site is probably only functional in the presence of an intact linker sequence. Taken together, these results indicate that additional regions of CN, other than that reported previously (21Li H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1659-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), are also involved in the interaction with NFAT, generating a more complex picture for the CN-NFAT interaction. Mutational analysis of the linker region allowed us to identify residues that affect interaction via this NFAT region. All three substitutions (S337P, H339L, and L343S) severely impaired the in vitro interaction with NFATc2, which only contains a PxIxIT site. The PxIxIT-derived VIVIT peptide is a high affinity NFAT inhibitor (20Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and has been proposed as an investigative and therapeutic tool. But the discovery that most identified CN binding proteins contain a PxIxIT-like motif within the region that interacts with CN suggests that this peptide might not be highly selective for NFAT. The finding that a single amino acid substitution (L343S) selectively blocks interaction with NFAT without affecting the interaction of CN with other proteins (Cabin-1 or AKAP79) is of special significance. Reagents that exploit the selective interaction of CN with NFAT through residues of the linker region would be of use in dissecting important biological processes in which the CN/NFAT pathway plays a key role. These include the activation and development of the immune system, patterning of the vasculature, morphogenesis of the heart valves, and muscle and neural development. Moreover, most side effects of the immunosuppressive drugs CsA and FK506 are thought to be mediated through the inhibition of CN substrates other than NFAT. Specific inhibitors that selectively target the linker region of CN would enable discrimination between binding of NFAT versus other substrates. This fine mapping may thus support the design of less toxic and more specific treatments for diseases where the CN/NFAT pathway is involved, including the pathological situations related to angiogenesis or cardiac and skeletal muscle growth.

https://openalex.org/W2141695685,"Our work is focused in the broad area of strategies and efforts to inhibit protein-protein interactions. The possible strategies in this field are definitely much more varied than in the case of ATP-pocket inhibitors. In our previous work (10), we reported that a retro-inverso (RI) form of Helix1 (H1) of c-Myc, linked to an RI-internalization sequence arising from the third alpha-helix of Antennapedia (Int) was endowed with an antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity toward the cancer cell lines MCF-7 and HCT-116. The activity apparently was dependent upon the presence of the Myc motif. In this work, by ala-scan mapping of the H1 portion of our molecules with D-aa, we found two amino acids necessary for antiproliferative activity: D-Lys in 4 and D-Arg in 5 (numbers refer to L-forms). In the natural hetero-dimer, these two side chains project to the outside of the four alpha-helix bundle. Moreover, we were able to obtain three peptides more active than the original lead. They strongly reduced cell proliferation and survival (RI-Int-VV-H1-E2A,S6A,F8A; RI-Int-VV-H1-S6A,F8A,R11A; RI-Int-VV-H1-S6A,F8A,Q13A): after 8 days at 10 muM total cell number was approximately 1% of the number of cells initially seeded. In these more potent molecules, the ablated side chains project to the inside in the corresponding natural four alpha-helix bundle. In the present work, we also investigated the behavior of our molecules at the biochemical level. Using both a circular dichroism (CD) and a fluorescence anisotropy approach, we noted that side chains projecting at the interior of the four alpha-helix bundle are needed for inducing the partial unfolding of Myc-H2, without an opening of the leucine zipper. Side chains projecting at the outside are not required for this biochemical effect. However, antiproliferative activity had the opposite requirements: side chains projecting at the outside of the bundle were essential, and, on the contrary, ablation of one side chain at a time projecting at the inside increased rather than decreased biological activity. We conclude that our active molecules probably interfere at the level of a protein-protein interaction between Myc-Max and a third protein of the transcription complex. Finally, CD and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data, plus dynamic simulations, suggest a prevalent random coil conformation of the H1 portion of our molecules, at least in diluted solutions. The introduction of a kink (substitution with proline in positions 5 or 7) led to an important reduction of biological activity. We have also synthesized a longer peptido-mimetic molecule (RI-Int-H1-S6A,F8A-loop-H2) with the intent of obtaining a wider zone of interaction and a stronger interference at the level of the higher-order structure (enhanceosome). RI-Int-H1-S6A,F8A-loop-H2 was less active rather than more active in respect to RI-Int-VV-H1-S6A,F8A, apparently because it has a clear bent to form a beta-sheet (CD and NMR data)."

In this report, a regulatory element “TGCTCTC” in the γ-fibrinogen promoter region, -322 to -316, is identified, which is involved in increased expression of γ chain in HepG2 cells that are transfected with Bβ fibrinogen cDNA. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, three DNA-protein complexes were found to form with the regulatory element. The amount of the protein complexes that bind with the regulatory element was much reduced in HepG2 cells transfected with Bβ cDNA. By DNA-affinity chromatography, mass spectrometry, and supershift assay, human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) was identified as a component of the complexes. Overexpression of hnRNP A1 suppressed basal γ-fibrinogen transcription. These results indicate that the basal expression of γ-fibrinogen is regulated by a constitutive transcriptional repressor protein, hnRNP A1, and the decreased binding activity of hnRNP A1 leads to the overexpression of γ chain in HepG2 cells that overexpress the Bβ chain.

Fibrinogen (340 kDa) is a dimer with each half-molecule composed of three different polypeptide chains as follows: Aα, 67 kDa; Bβ, 56 kDa; and γ, 47 kDa. Two of the chains, Bβ and γ, are glycoproteins with N-linked sugars (1.Henschen A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2.Blomback B. Thromb.

The three chains of fibrinogen are mainly synthesized in liver hepatic parenchymal cells, and the nascent chains are then processed, glycosylated, and assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum in a stepwise manner and eventually secreted into the circulating plasma (7.Yu S.

Fibrinogen is an acute phase protein, and its biosynthesis may increase 2–10-fold during the acute phase reaction (11.Evans E. Courtois G.M. Kilian P.L. Fuller G.M. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol.

The consensus binding sequences for STAT-3 have been identified in the promoter region of all three fibrinogen genes (15.Zhang Z. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol.

Thus at least two phenomena control expression of the fibrinogen genes as follows: liver-specific constitutive regulation and modulation during the acute phase response. At the basal level, there appears to be different levels of gene regulation. For example, there is an excess of Aα and γ and smaller amounts of Bβ chains in HepG2 cells, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, partly due to reduced synthesis of Bβ chain, suggesting that Bβ is rate-limiting for the assembly and secretion of mature fibrinogen. The different amounts of intracellular fibrinogen chains, however, can also be due to a combination of different rates of expression and intracellular degradation (7.Yu S. Sher B. Kudryk B.

In HepG2 cells, overexpression of any one fibrinogen gene, elicited by transfection, leads to the concurrent up-regulation of the other two genes, suggesting coordinate gene expression (22.Roy S. Overton O. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 691-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Roy S. Mukhopadhyay G. Redman C.M. J. Biol.

The up-regulation of fibrinogen genes is because of the increased RNA biosynthesis (22.Roy S. Overton O. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 691-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the process that coordinates the basal expression of the three fibrinogen chains is not understood. In this study, a regulatory element involved in this coordinated expression is identified in the γ gene promoter region, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is shown to be a component of this regulatory element binding complex. There are over 20 heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), designated A–U, in human cells (25.Pinol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These proteins contribute to the complex around nascent pre-mRNA and thus are able to modulate RNA processing (26.Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar, 27.Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). hnRNP A1 is the best characterized protein from this family. It has a role in pre-mRNA processing and mRNA transport and participates in telomeric length maintenance (28.Mayeda A. Krainer A.R.

Recently, an additional role for hnRNP A1 in RNA biogenesis has been reported because it could be a regulator of gene expression through direct DNA binding or interaction with other proteins (33.Takimoto M.

For example, hnRNP A1 has been described to suppress human thymidine kinase gene transcriptional activity by binding to its promoter (34.Lau J.S. Baumeister P. Kim E. Roy B. Hsieh T. Lai M. Lee A.S.J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). hnRNP A1 can also modulate apoE promoter activity by interacting with the -219T allelic form (37.Campillos M.

The interaction of hnRNP A1 with hormone-response elements of vitamin D receptor can cause vitamin D resistance (35.Chen H. Hu B. Allegretto E.A. Adams J.S. J. Biol.

In this work, human hnRNP A1 is identified as a constitutive transcriptional repressor protein that regulates fibrinogen γ chain gene transcription. Materials—The rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human hnRNP A/B and hnRNP C1/C2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat polyclonal antibodies to human hnRNP A3 and hnRNP A0 were also purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal rabbit antibody to AUF1 (hnRNP D) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and a mouse monoclonal antibody to hnRNP A2B1 was from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The mouse monoclonal antibody to hnRNP A1 was a generous gift from Dr. G. Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania). Cell Culture—HepG2 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The stable cell lines Bβ-HepG2 cells that were transfected with Bβ cDNA expression vector and overexpress Bβ chains and the control cells, Neo-HepG2, transfected with control vector were maintained in DEME medium with 0.6 mg/ml geneticin as described previously (22.Roy S. Overton O. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 691-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Roy S. Mukhopadhyay G. Redman C.M. J. Biol.

Plasmid Constructs and Mutagenesis—A series of DNA fragments containing different lengths of γ promoter regions was obtained from the genomic DNA of HepG2 cells by PCR and was cloned into the polylinker region of a luciferase reporter gene vector pGL3 (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis in the γ promoter region in the pGL 3 vector was performed according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The expression vectors for human hnRNP A1 were generous gifts from Dr. John S. Adams (Burns and Allen Research Institute, CA) and Dr. Amy S. Lee (University of Southern California). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—Aliquots (20 × 103 cells) of Neo- and Bβ-HepG2 cells were plated in 24-well plates and cultured as described above to 80% confluence. After 24 h of culture, cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of various γ-luciferase plasmids and site-directed mutant constructs using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). To determine transfection efficiency, 0.1 μg of Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase plasmid was cotransfected with each test plasmid. After transfection, Neo- and Bβ-HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h and then lysed using 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and processed for luciferase assay (Promega). For transfections analyzing the effect of hnRNP A1, normal HepG2 cells were cotransfected with reporter plasmids, β-galactosidase plasmid, and hnRNP A1 expression plasmid or the control plasmid. After incubation for 48 h with the appropriate medium, the cells were harvested, and extracts were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts from normal HepG2 cells or Neo- and Bβ-HepG2 cells were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentration was quantified by spectrophotometry using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were synthesized as complementary single strands (Invitrogen) and annealed at 92 °C for 10 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Sequences of the various oligonucleotides used were as follows: γ-fibrinogen wild-type probe (WTP) I, −357AGACTAGGTTTGCTTAGTTCGAGGTCATAT−328; γ-fibrinogen WTPII, −328TCTGTTTGCTCTCAGCCATG−309; mutant probe 1 (MP1), −328TCTGTTTGCGATCAGCCATG−309; mutant probe 2 (MP2), −328TCTGTTTGATATTAGCCATG−309. Probes were prepared by end labeling the double-stranded oligonucleotides with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, followed by G-50 column purification. The nuclear extracts were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The labeled probe was then added to each reaction for a 20-min incubation at room temperature, and the DNA-protein complexes that formed were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. For competition assays, unlabeled probes were used at 30 m excess to radiolabeled probes. For supershift assays, the nuclear extracts were preincubated overnight with antibody at 4 °C prior to performing the EMSA procedures. DNA Affinity Chromatography—A DNA affinity resin was prepared as described by Kadonaga and Tjian (19.Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The high pressure liquid chromatography-purified 28-mer oligonucleotide containing three copies of the identified binding site (5′-TGTTTGCTCTCTGCTCTCTGCTCTCAGC-3′) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL4B. Affinity chromatography was performed by combining the nuclear extract from HepG2 cells with competitor DNA poly(dI-dC), pelleting the insoluble protein-DNA complexes by centrifugation, and loading the resulting soluble material onto the DNA affinity column (2 ml) equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 60 mm KCl. Then the affinity column was washed with 20 column volumes of the same buffer and eluted stepwise with buffer B containing 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 m of KCl. The eluted fractions were subjected to EMSA and SDS-PAGE analysis. Furthermore, the SDS-PAGE protein bands of interest were excised following Coomassie Blue staining. Protein fingerprinting was performed by tryptic digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) by the Protein Core Facility of Columbia University. Southwestern Blotting Assay—Affinity-purified proteins were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was processed for binding assay with labeled probe as described by Wilkison et al. (38.Wilkison G. Seto D. Parker C.S. Cell. 1988; 54: 841-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Nuclear extracts from Neo- and Bβ-HepG2 cells, separated by SDS-PAGE, were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The nonspecific binding sites of the membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat milk, followed by addition of the mouse monoclonal antibody to hnRNP A1 or CREB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit polyclonal antibody to AUF1. The amount of primary antibody bound to the proteins was detected using an Immun-Star chemiluminescence kit. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Neo- and Bβ-HepG2 cells were labeled with l-[35S]methionine for 1 h. The incubation media were collected, and secreted fibrinogen was isolated, as described previously (24.Xia H. Redman C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) from the incubation media by immunoprecipitation. In pulse-chase experiments, normal HepG2 cells transfected with hnRNP A1 expression vector or control vector were pulse-labeled with l-[35S]methionine for 8 min, and intracellular hnRNP A1 and fibrinogen were isolated by immunoprecipitation from the cell lysates. Transcription Activity of γ-Fibrinogen Promoter Deletion Constructs in Both Neo- and Bβ-HepG2 Cells—Our previous studies demonstrated that HepG2 cells transfected with any one of the fibrinogen chain cDNAs resulted in an increased synthesis and secretion of fibrinogen and that Bβ-HepG2 cells were more effective than Aα-HepG2 cells and γ-HepG2 cells in overexpressing fibrinogen. As shown in Fig. 1A, when control (Neo-HepG2) cells and those transfected with Bβ fibrinogen cDNA (Bβ-HepG2) were metabolically labeled for 1 h with l-[35S]methionine and the amount of radioactive fibrinogen secreted into the incubation media was measured, the Bβ-HepG2 cells synthesized and secreted more fibrinogen than the control Neo-HepG2 cells. These cell systems (Neo- and Bβ-HepG2 cells) were used to identify the regulatory elements in the promoter region involved in increased expression of γ-fibrinogen chain in cells overexpressing Bβ chain. To localize the regulatory elements in γ-fibrinogen promoter, different lengths of γ promoter were obtained by PCR and subcloned into a luciferase reporter gene vector pGL3(Promega). These deletion constructs were transiently transfected into Neo-HepG2 and Bβ-HepG2 cells, and the luciferase activities were measured and compared in both control HepG2 cells (Neo-HepG2) and in Bβ-HepG2 cells (Fig. 1B). The luciferase activities were higher in the Bβ-HepG2 cells as compared with the control cells when intact fibrinogen promoter was used and when deletions were made up to -357. However, when the γ chain promoter was deleted from -357 to -307, the Bβ-HepG2 cells had the same luciferase activity as the control cells. These results indicate that the -357 to -307 region of γ-fibrinogen promoter contains important elements that are involved in its overexpression in Bβ-HepG2 cells. Identification of the Regulatory Elements That Are Involved in γ-Fibrinogen Overexpression in Bβ-HepG2 Cells—To determine whether any binding factors may reside in the -357 to -307 region of γ-fibrinogen promoter, two γ-fibrinogen wild-type probes (WTPI and WTPII) covering the γ promoter region -357 to -309 were used for gel shift assays (Fig. 2). Nuclear proteins were isolated from Neo- and Bβ-HepG2 cells. By using WTPI probe (-357 to -328), a nuclear protein was bound to the labeled probe. The nuclear protein complex from Neo-HepG2 cell had a similar intensity to that from Bβ-HepG2 cells. However, at least three prominent DNA-protein complexes (complexes I, II, and III) were observed with WTP II probe (-328 to -309). Most interestingly, the intensity of the three nuclear complexes was much reduced when the nuclear proteins were from Bβ-HepG2 cells rather than from control Neo-HepG2 cells. This result suggests that the γ promoter region -328 to -309 may contain a regulatory element involved in its overexpression and that the nuclear factors bound to the element may be transcription inhibitors. To characterize the binding elements, two mutant forms of the WTP II probe were constructed by altering selected nucleotides. Mutant probe (MP) I changes 2 bases located in the middle part of WTP II probe, and MPII changes 3 bases around the middle part of WTP II probe. The two mutant oligonucleotides were used as competitors in EMSA employing nuclear proteins obtained from normal HepG2 cells. Results are shown in Fig. 3. Three protein complexes were detected with the wild-type probe (WTP II) (Fig. 3, lane 2), and unlabeled WTP II probe almost abolished the formation of the protein-DNA complexes. However, 30-fold excess of unlabeled MPI and MPII could not abolish the formation of the protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that there is a protein-binding site around the region of the CTCTC sequence in the WTP II probe. Functional Analysis of the Forming Site of the Three Nuclear Protein Complexes—To prove further that the γ-fibrinogen promoter region from -320 to -316 (“CTCTC” sequence) contains a regulatory element, luciferase reporter assays were performed with γ-fibrinogen promoter constructs containing internal deletions. The pGL3-γ357 vector was used for site-directed mutagenesis. Based on the EMSA results described above, we deleted a 5-bp “TCTCA” (from -319 to -315) fragment from the pGL3-γ357 vector. The mutagenized construct was then transfected into Neo- and Bβ-HepG2 cells. Luciferase reporter assays with the mutagenized construct showed that deletion of this region significantly reduced the luciferase activity in Bβ-HepG2 cells to near control levels (Fig. 4A). This result indicates that the region within the γ-fibrinogen promoter region from -320 to -315 not only binds with nuclear proteins but also contains a functional regulatory site involved in overexpression of γ-fibrinogen in Bβ-HepG2 cells. Next, to identify accurately the regulatory element involved in overexpression of γ-fibrinogen in Bβ-HepG2 cells, a series of pGL3-γ357 vectors were constructed containing single or double base deletions within the “CTCTCA” sequence. The sites altered are shown in Fig. 4B. These vectors were then transfected into Neo- and Bβ-HepG2 cells, and luciferase assays were performed. Single or double base deletions within the box “TGCTCTC” (-322 to -316) reduced luciferase activities in Bβ-HepG2 cells to the level in Neo-HepG2 cells (Fig. 4B). However, wild-type construct and two mutations outside the box (Fig. 4B, constructs 5 and 6) had no effect. Therefore, this box TGCTCTC in the γ-fibrinogen promoter region from -322 to -316 may be a regulatory site involved in the overexpression of γ-fibrinogen in Bβ-HepG2 cells. Affinity Purification of the Protein Generating One of the DNA-Protein Complexes—The experiments described above suggested that the TGCTCTC box may be involved in the overexpression of γ-fibrinogen gene and that several protein complexes are bound to this sequence. To identify the proteins, nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells were subjected to DNA affinity chromatography. The DNA affinity resin was prepared by coupling a 28-mer oligonucleotide containing three copies of TGCTCTC to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL4B. The eluted fractions from the affinity column were subjected to gel mobility shift assay using the labeled probe containing three times TGCTCTC sequences. The EMSA result showed that fractions 8 and 9 that eluted with 0.6 m KCl contained the binding activity (Fig. 5A). SDS-PAGE showed that several major protein bands appeared in fractions 8 and 9 but were not clearly detected in the fractions eluted with low KCl concentration (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, one of the proteins present in fractions 8 and 9, about 34 kDa, reacted positively in a Southwestern blotting assay (Fig. 5C). The 34-kDa protein band in fraction 8 was therefore excised from the Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to tryptic digestion and analysis by MALDI-MS. The peptide masses obtained by MS were then entered into a search program that scans the data base, in most cases NCBI or Genpept, to find a match. The most significant match to a known human protein was with hnRNP A1. Western blot analyses were then performed on several of the fractions eluted from the affinity column with hnRNP A1 antibody, and strong reactions were obtained in fractions 8 and 9 with less in fraction 10 (Fig. 5D). Nuclear extracts from Bβ-HepG2 and Neo-HepG2 cells were also analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 5E), and there were less hnRNP A1 proteins in the nuclear extract of Bβ-HepG2 cells than from control Neo-HepG2 cells. However, the amounts of two other transcription factors, AUF1 and CREB1, were the same in the two cells. These results are in agreement with the EMSAs (Fig. 2) that showed less DNA-protein complexes in Bβ-HepG2 cells than that in control cells. Confirmation That hnRNP A1 Binds to the TGCTCTC Box in γ-Fibrinogen Promoter—Our previous EMSA results showed that three protein complexes reacted with WTP II, which contain the TGCTCTC sequence, but not with mutated probes, in which the “CTCTC” sequence was altered. To confirm that hnRNP A1 is a component of these protein complexes, we performed supershift assays with the antibody to hnRNP A1. The results are shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6A, the gel shift assay was performed in the presence of anti-hnRNP A/B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with the previously described WTP II probe. Compared with the control that contained nonimmune serum (Fig. 6A, lane 1), three complexes were competed away by addition of this antibody, and in addition a supershifted band was observed (Fig. 6A, lane 2). However anti-hnRNP C1/C2 was not able to inhibit the formation of the three complexes (Fig. 6A, lane 3). Because the hnRNP A/B antibody is a rabbit polyclonal antibody and reacts with several kinds of hnRNPs (A0, A1, A2, A3, B1, and D etc.), the result suggests that all three complexes may be derived from hnRNPs. Next, further supershift assays were performed with a series of antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6B, the addition of a mouse monoclonal antibody to human hnRNP A1 reduced the binding of complexes I and III with WTP II probe (Fig. 6B, lane 4). Except for anti-hnRNP A1 that decreased the amounts of complexes I and III, other antibodies tested (Fig. 6B, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6) had no effect, suggesting that complex II may be derived from other hnRNPs. Effect of hnRNP A1 on the Transcriptional Activity of γ-Fibrinogen Promoter—To confirm the functional link between fibrinogen expression and hnRNP A1-mediated transcription, further reporter studies were carried out using HepG2 cells cotransfected with a γ-luciferase reporter vector together with expression constructs for hnRNP A1 or empty vector alone (control). The results are shown in Fig. 7A. By using the wild-type luciferase reporter vector pGL-γ357, overexpression of hnRNP A1 was able to suppress basal γ-fibrinogen transcription. However, the suppression effect was abolished when either the mutant vector in which the hnRNP A1 binding sequence TGCTCTC (-322 to -316) was deleted from the pGL-γ357 or the shortened γ promoterluciferase reporter vectors (pGL-γ307 and pGL-γ280) were used. These results also explain the previous EMSA finding in which the intensity of the nuclear protein complex binding with WTP II probe was much reduced in the Bβ-HepG2 cells, indicating that it is the decreased binding of repressor protein hnRNP A1 with γ promoter leads to the overexpression of γ-fibrinogen in Bβ-HepG2 cells. The effect of overexpression of hnRNP A1 on the synthesis of fibrinogen was also determined. HepG2 cells were transfected with either hnRNP A1 expression vector or an empty vector as a control. After 48 h the transfected cells were pulse-labeled with l-[35S]methionine for 8 min, and the amounts of radioactive fibrinogen and hnRNP A1 were determined. As expected, cells transfected with hnRNP A1 cDNA synthesized more hnRNP A1 but less γ-fibrinogen chain than control cells. Most interestingly, the synthesis of the other two fibrinogen chains, Aα and Bβ, was also reduced in the HepG2 cells transfected with hnRNP A1 (Fig. 7B), indicating that hnRNP A1 may also be involved in regulating, by suppression, the expression of the Aα and Bβ chains. In addition, the overexpression of fibrinogen in Bβ-HepG2 cells might be due to decreased amounts and activity of hnRNP A1 in the cell nucleus. Fibrinogen expression is regulated at the following two levels: the basal or constitutive level and during the acute phase response when it is stimulated by IL-6. When fibrinogen is expressed at basal levels, in HepG2 cells, there is steady state pool of surplus Aα and γ chains, present as Aα-γ and free γ chains (7.Yu S. Sher B. Kudryk B. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13407-13410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Yu S. Sher B. Kudryk B. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10574-10581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicate that overexpression of the basal rate of fibrinogen expression can be accomplished in HepG2 cells by transfection with vectors containing individual fibrinogen chain cDNAs (22.Roy S. Overton O. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 691-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Roy S. Mukhopadhyay G. Redman C.M. J. Biol.

In this situation, in which a single fibrinogen chain is overexpressed, the cells compensate by up-regulating the expression of the other two chains. Thus the expression of all three fibrinogen genes is tightly linked, but the mechanism by which this occurs is not yet understood. A comparison of the promoter regions of the three fibrinogen genes does not show striking general homology, which suggests that the genes may be independently expressed. However, many cis-acting elements in the three fibrinogen genes have been identified in common (15.Zhang Z. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24287-24291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 39.Anderson G.M. Shaw A.R. Shafer J.A. J. Biol.

In addition to these identified regulatory elements, a number of other as yet unidentified factors may be involved in regulating transcription of the three genes. Epidemiological studies support a direct correlation between certain polymorphisms in the promoter region of the Bβ gene and elevated circulating fibrinogen levels (44.Green F. Hamsten A. Blomback M. Humphries S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 45.Humphries S.E. Cook M. Dubowitz M. Stirling Y. Meade T.W.

An elevated level of plasma fibrinogen is also correlated with cardiovascular disease. The trans-activation protein complexes that bind to the Bβ gene promoter containing the −455G/A and −854G/A polymorphism has been described (47.Brown E.T. Fuller G.M. Blood. 1998; 92: 3286-3293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.'t Hooft F.M. von Bahr S.J. Silveira A. Iliadou A. Eriksson P. Hamsten A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 3063-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that −455G/A and −854G/A polymorphisms show increased Bβ fibrinogen chain expression (47.Brown E.T. Fuller G.M. Blood. 1998; 92: 3286-3293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.'t Hooft F.M. von Bahr S.J. Silveira A. Iliadou A. Eriksson P. Hamsten A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 3063-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and that these relatively common polymorphic forms are associated with increased levels of plasma fibrinogen in healthy middle-aged men (48.'t Hooft F.M. von Bahr S.J. Silveira A. Iliadou A. Eriksson P. Hamsten A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 3063-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These naturally occurring in vivo situations may be compared with the HepG2 system used in this study that overexpresses the Bβ chain. The current study identifies a regulatory sequence TGCTCTC in the γ-fibrinogen promoter that is involved in overexpression of the γ chain in HepG2 cells transfected with Bβ cDNA (Bβ-HepG2). Three protein complexes (I–III) particularly bind with the TGCTCTC box, and a nuclear protein, hnRNP A1, was identified as a component of complexes I and III. Furthermore, the EMSA results showed that the amount of nuclear complexes bound with TGCTCTC box was much reduced in Bβ-HepG2 cells, and in addition, overexpression of hnRNP A1 suppressed basal γ-fibrinogen transcription. Taken together these findings indicate that hnRNP A1 is a constitutive transcriptional repressor protein that regulates the basal expression of γ-fibrinogen. Overexpression of hnRNP A1 in normal HepG2 cells also leads to decreased synthesis of Aα and Bβ chains, suggesting that this factor may be a repressor not only for γ-fibrinogen but also affects the expression of the other two fibrinogen chains (Fig. 7B). Several similar elements with TGCTCTC sequence are also found in both Aα and Bβ gene promoters, indicating that hnRNP A1 may also regulate Aα and Bβ basal expression. hnRNP A1 is an abundantly expressed protein, which is better known as a participant in splicing, mRNA transport, and telomere biogenesis. In addition, it has also been shown recently that hnRNP A1 can act as either a transcriptional activator or a repressor. Although the sequence specificity for hnRNP A1 binding with double-stranded DNA, is not very clear, recent studies have identified a specific 36-bp target sequence (18.Donev R.M. Doneva T.A. Bowen R. Sheer D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 233: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The 36-bp sequence is as follows: 5′-GGCTGGTCTTGAACTCCTG(A/G)GCTCA(A/G)GTGATCCTCC-3′. Although the sequence does not contain the reported “ATTT” motif present in the human thymidine kinase gene promoter, which has been shown to bind hnRNP A1 and corresponds to its recognition sequence in RNA (34.Lau J.S. Baumeister P. Kim E. Roy B. Hsieh T. Lai M. Lee A.S.J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the 36-bp sequence includes two adjacent sites, “AGCTCA” and “AGGTGA,” which are underlined and are similar to a recently reported hnRNP A1 binding sequence “AGGTCA.” The AGGTCA site can bind hnRNP A1 and leads to vitamin D resistance (36.Chen H. Hewison M. Hu B. Adams J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6109-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, within the hnRNP A1 binding sequence TGCTCTC, which is present in the γ-fibrinogen promoter region, there are two sequences similar to the underlined site in the 36-bp sequence. One sequence “TGCTCT” (-322 to -317) is similar to the AGCTCA site, and another one has the same sequence as “CTCAG” (-318 to -314 in the γ promoter region). This result suggests that the underlined site (A/G)GCTCA(A/G)GTGA in the 36-bp sequence may participate in hnRNP A1 binding. Most interestingly, in this report three protein complexes are found to bind with the TGCTCTC box in the γ-fibrinogen promoter region. EMSAs with a monoclonal antibody to hnRNP A1 indicate that complexes I and III contain hnRNP A1, whereas complex II, which is affected by a polyclonal antibody to several hnRNPs but not by the monoclonal antibody to hnRNP A1, may contain an hnRNP family member. hnRNPs are known to have a modular structure, and some of the glycine-rich domains may mediate protein-protein interactions (26.Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar, 27.Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Thus, they have the opportunity to form homodimers or trimers and to facilitate or interfere with the oligomerization of other hnRNPs or cellular factors. For example, it has been reported that hnRNP A1 can bind to its site together with other hnRNPs. Both p37AUF (hnRNP D) and hnRNP A1 can bind the ATTT site in human thymidine kinase gene promoter. On the other hand, hnRNP K can inhibit the ability of both p37AUF and hnRNP A1 to bind to the thymidine kinase gene promoter by protein-protein interaction with the two hnRNPs (34.Lau J.S. Baumeister P. Kim E. Roy B. Hsieh T. Lai M. Lee A.S.J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although this study identifies hnRNP A1 as a repressor factor involved in the expression of γ-fibrinogen in Bβ-HepG2 cells, which overexpress Bβ chains, the mechanism by which overexpression of any one fibrinogen chain up-regulates the expression of the other two chains is not yet fully understood. In this study, it is shown that there are less amounts of nuclear hnRNP A1 in Bβ-HepG2 than that in control cells. Thus, the decreased amounts of repressor hnRNP A1 leads to less binding on the γ-fibrinogen promoter and to up-regulation of the γ-fibrinogen gene. However, we do not yet know the sensing mechanism that either the increased levels of Bβ fibrinogen RNA or of its protein chain triggers the events leading to a decrease of nuclear hnRNP A1.
