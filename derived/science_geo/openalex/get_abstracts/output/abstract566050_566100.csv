https://openalex.org/W2505532605,"Classically, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) stimulation promotes G protein signaling at the plasma membrane, followed by rapid β-arrestin-mediated desensitization and receptor internalization into endosomes. However, it has been demonstrated that some GPCRs activate G proteins from within internalized cellular compartments, resulting in sustained signaling. We have used a variety of biochemical, biophysical, and cell-based methods to demonstrate the existence, functionality, and architecture of internalized receptor complexes composed of a single GPCR, β-arrestin, and G protein. These super-complexes or ""megaplexes"" more readily form at receptors that interact strongly with β-arrestins via a C-terminal tail containing clusters of serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. Single-particle electron microscopy analysis of negative-stained purified megaplexes reveals that a single receptor simultaneously binds through its core region with G protein and through its phosphorylated C-terminal tail with β-arrestin. The formation of such megaplexes provides a potential physical basis for the newly appreciated sustained G protein signaling from internalized GPCRs."
https://openalex.org/W2495352079,"The emerging field of bioelectronic medicine seeks methods for deciphering and modulating electrophysiological activity in the body to attain therapeutic effects at target organs. Current approaches to interfacing with peripheral nerves and muscles rely heavily on wires, creating problems for chronic use, while emerging wireless approaches lack the size scalability necessary to interrogate small-diameter nerves. Furthermore, conventional electrode-based technologies lack the capability to record from nerves with high spatial resolution or to record independently from many discrete sites within a nerve bundle. Here, we demonstrate neural dust, a wireless and scalable ultrasonic backscatter system for powering and communicating with implanted bioelectronics. We show that ultrasound is effective at delivering power to mm-scale devices in tissue; likewise, passive, battery-less communication using backscatter enables high-fidelity transmission of electromyogram (EMG) and electroneurogram (ENG) signals from anesthetized rats. These results highlight the potential for an ultrasound-based neural interface system for advancing future bioelectronics-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2509365953,"What determines the cortical location at which a given functionally specific region will arise in development? We tested the hypothesis that functionally specific regions develop in their characteristic locations because of pre-existing differences in the extrinsic connectivity of that region to the rest of the brain. We exploited the visual word form area (VWFA) as a test case, scanning children with diffusion and functional imaging at age 5, before they learned to read, and at age 8, after they learned to read. We found the VWFA developed functionally in this interval and that its location in a particular child at age 8 could be predicted from that child's connectivity fingerprints (but not functional responses) at age 5. These results suggest that early connectivity instructs the functional development of the VWFA, possibly reflecting a general mechanism of cortical development."
https://openalex.org/W2482310845,"Working memory (WM) enables the storage and manipulation of limited amounts of information over short periods. Prominent models posit that increasing the number of remembered items decreases the spiking activity dedicated to each item via mutual inhibition, which irreparably degrades the fidelity of each item's representation. We tested these models by determining if degraded memory representations could be recovered following a post-cue indicating which of several items in spatial WM would be recalled. Using an fMRI-based image reconstruction technique, we identified impaired behavioral performance and degraded mnemonic representations with elevated memory load. However, in several cortical regions, degraded mnemonic representations recovered substantially following a post-cue, and this recovery tracked behavioral performance. These results challenge pure spike-based models of WM and suggest that remembered items are additionally encoded within latent or hidden neural codes that can help reinvigorate active WM representations."
https://openalex.org/W2494960642,"We used clinical tissue from lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients obtained at rapid autopsy to evaluate diverse genomic, transcriptomic, and phosphoproteomic datasets for pathway analysis. Using Tied Diffusion through Interacting Events (TieDIE), we integrated differentially expressed master transcriptional regulators, functionally mutated genes, and differentially activated kinases in CRPC tissues to synthesize a robust signaling network consisting of druggable kinase pathways. Using MSigDB hallmark gene sets, six major signaling pathways with phosphorylation of several key residues were significantly enriched in CRPC tumors after incorporation of phosphoproteomic data. Individual autopsy profiles developed using these hallmarks revealed clinically relevant pathway information potentially suitable for patient stratification and targeted therapies in late stage prostate cancer. Here, we describe phosphorylation-based cancer hallmarks using integrated personalized signatures (pCHIPS) that shed light on the diversity of activated signaling pathways in metastatic CRPC while providing an integrative, pathway-based reference for drug prioritization in individual patients."
https://openalex.org/W2489530548,"Ewan Pearson, Kathleen Giacomini and the Metformin Genetics Consortium perform a genome-wide association study for glycemic response to the antidiabetic drug metformin. They find an intronic allele of the GLUT2 glucose transporter gene that associates with greater metformin action, an effect that is more pronounced in obese individuals. Metformin is the first-line antidiabetic drug with over 100 million users worldwide, yet its mechanism of action remains unclear1. Here the Metformin Genetics (MetGen) Consortium reports a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS), consisting of 13,123 participants of different ancestries. The C allele of rs8192675 in the intron of SLC2A2, which encodes the facilitated glucose transporter GLUT2, was associated with a 0.17% (P = 6.6 × 10−14) greater metformin-induced reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in 10,577 participants of European ancestry. rs8192675 was the top cis expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) for SLC2A2 in 1,226 human liver samples, suggesting a key role for hepatic GLUT2 in regulation of metformin action. Among obese individuals, C-allele homozygotes at rs8192675 had a 0.33% (3.6 mmol/mol) greater absolute HbA1c reduction than T-allele homozygotes. This was about half the effect seen with the addition of a DPP-4 inhibitor, and equated to a dose difference of 550 mg of metformin, suggesting rs8192675 as a potential biomarker for stratified medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2512606363,"African rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.) is a cereal crop species closely related to Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.) but was independently domesticated in West Africa ∼3,000 years ago. African rice is rarely grown outside sub-Saharan Africa but is of global interest because of its tolerance to abiotic stresses. Here we describe a map of 2.32 million SNPs of African rice from whole-genome resequencing of 93 landraces. Population genomic analysis shows a population bottleneck in this species that began ∼13,000-15,000 years ago with effective population size reaching its minimum value ∼3,500 years ago, suggesting a protracted period of population size reduction likely commencing with predomestication management and/or cultivation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for six salt tolerance traits identify 11 significant loci, 4 of which are within ∼300 kb of genomic regions that possess signatures of positive selection, suggesting adaptive geographical divergence for salt tolerance in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2484862915,"Eukaryotic cells can ""remember"" transient encounters with a wide range of stimuli, inducing lasting states of altered responsiveness. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are a specialized lineage of suppressive CD4 T cells that act as critical negative regulators of inflammation in various biological contexts. Treg cells exposed to inflammatory conditions acquire strongly enhanced suppressive function. Using inducible genetic tracing, we analyzed the long-term stability of activation-induced transcriptional, epigenomic, and functional changes in Treg cells. We found that the inflammation-experienced Treg cell population reversed many activation-induced changes and lost its enhanced suppressive function over time. The ""memory-less"" potentiation of Treg suppressor function may help avoid a state of generalized immunosuppression that could otherwise result from repeated activation."
https://openalex.org/W2491973535,"Energy production in the brain depends almost exclusively on oxidative metabolism. Neurons have small energy reserves and require a continuous supply of oxygen (O2). It is therefore not surprising that one of the hallmarks of normal brain function is the tight coupling between cerebral blood flow and neuronal activity. Since capillaries are embedded in the O2-consuming neuropil, we have here examined whether activity-dependent dips in O2 tension drive capillary hyperemia. In vivo analyses showed that transient dips in tissue O2 tension elicit capillary hyperemia. Ex vivo experiments revealed that red blood cells (RBCs) themselves act as O2 sensors that autonomously regulate their own deformability and thereby flow velocity through capillaries in response to physiological decreases in O2 tension. This observation has broad implications for understanding how local changes in blood flow are coupled to synaptic transmission."

We combined in vivo optogenetic and pharmacological perturbations to elucidate the functional roles of these neurons in breathing. In transgenic adult mice expressing channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in Dbx1+ neurons, photoresponsive preBötC neurons had preinspiratory or inspiratory firing patterns associated with excitatory effects on burst timing and pattern. In transgenic adult mice expressing ChR2 in SST+ neurons, photoresponsive preBötC neurons had inspiratory or postinspiratory firing patterns associated with excitatory responses on pattern or inhibitory responses that were largely eliminated by blocking synaptic inhibition within preBötC or by local viral infection limiting ChR2 expression to preBötC SST+ neurons. We conclude that: (1) preinspiratory preBötC Dbx1+ neurons are rhythmogenic, (2) inspiratory preBötC Dbx1+ and SST+ neurons primarily act to pattern respiratory motor output, and (3) SST+-neuron-mediated pathways and postsynaptic inhibition within preBötC modulate breathing pattern.

The preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) is a heterogeneous medullary population of ∼1,000–3,000 neurons/side that is the presumptive kernel for respiratory rhythm generation in rodents (Feldman et al., 2013Feldman J.L.

Laser ablation of Dbx1 neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex stops inspiratory rhythm and impairs output in neonatal mice.eLife. 2014; 3: e03427Google Scholar). In rhythmically active slice preparations from neonatal rodents, preBötC Dbx1+ neurons have a preinspiratory firing pattern, initiating spike activity before the onset of each inspiratory hypoglossal nerve burst, and continue to fire throughout inspiration (Picardo et al., 2013Picardo M.C.

In vitro, a subset of Dbx1+ neurons are premotoneurons, projecting directly to motoneurons and transmitting bursts of inspiratory activity that ultimately pattern inspiratory muscle contraction (Kam et al., 2013aKam K.

Laser ablation of Dbx1 neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex stops inspiratory rhythm and impairs output in neonatal mice.eLife. 2014; 3: e03427Google Scholar). Somatostatin (SST) is expressed in a subset of preBötC Dbx1+ neurons that partially overlaps with neurokinin 1 receptor-positive (NK1R+) neurons (Gray et al., 2010Gray P.A. Hayes J.A. Ling G.Y.

Janczewski W.A. Mellen N. McCrimmon D.R. Feldman J.L. Normal breathing requires preBötzinger complex neurokinin-1 receptor-expressing neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 927-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) results in ataxic breathing patterns during wakefulness and apnea during sleep (McKay et al., 2005McKay L.C. Janczewski W.A. Feldman J.L. Sleep-disordered breathing after targeted ablation of preBötzinger complex neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1142-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas acute (∼4 min) silencing of SST+ preBötC neurons results in persistent apnea (Tan et al., 2008Tan W. Janczewski W.A. Yang P. Shao X.M. Callaway E.M. Feldman J.L. Silencing preBötzinger complex somatostatin-expressing neurons induces persistent apnea in awake rat.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Together these data indicate that, in rodents (in vitro and in vivo), preBötC Dbx1+ and SST+ neurons are critical for generating and patterning rhythmic inspiratory motor nerve bursts that drive breathing movements. Photostimulation of preBötC neurons expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) driven by the synapsin promoter potently drives inspiratory activity in vivo (Alsahafi et al., 2015Alsahafi Z. Dickson C.T. Pagliardini S. Optogenetic excitation of preBötzinger complex neurons potently drives inspiratory activity in vivo.J. Physiol. 2015; 593: 3673-3692Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, synapsin is a pan-neuronal promoter that cannot distinguish among different populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Consequently, the preBötC subpopulations responsible for excitation-mediated rhythm and pattern generation (Greer et al., 1991Greer J.J. Smith J.C. Feldman J.L. Role of excitatory amino acids in the generation and transmission of respiratory drive in neonatal rat.J. Physiol. 1991; 437: 727-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and for the roles of GABA- and glycine-mediated postsynaptic inhibition in the Breuer-Hering inflation reflex (BHIR) (Janczewski et al., 2013Janczewski W.A. Tashima A. Hsu P. Cui Y. Feldman J.L. Role of inhibition in respiratory pattern generation.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 5454-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), in modulating breathing frequency, in shaping the pattern of respiratory motor output, and in producing apneas essential for such behaviors as swallowing, phonation, and breath holding (Sherman et al., 2015Sherman D. Worrell J.W. Cui Y. Feldman J.L. Optogenetic perturbation of preBötzinger complex inhibitory neurons modulates respiratory pattern.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) must still be specified. The functional role of various preBötC subpopulations can be elucidated by differentially perturbing their excitability, e.g., for inhibitory neurons (Sherman et al., 2015Sherman D. Worrell J.W. Cui Y. Feldman J.L. Optogenetic perturbation of preBötzinger complex inhibitory neurons modulates respiratory pattern.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine the in vivo roles of preBötC Dbx1+ and SST+ neurons in rhythm and pattern generation and to deconstruct the related neural microcircuits, we employed Cre/loxP transgenic strategies to express ChR2-tdTomato in Dbx1+ neurons (Dbx1-ChR2) or SST+ neurons (SST-ChR2). We also expressed ChR2 in preBötC SST+ neurons by targeted injection of a Cre-dependent ChR2 virus into the preBötC of transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase in SST+ neurons. We then examined the effects of photostimulation on breathing. We conclude that the preBötC is composed of partially overlapping subpopulations that form functionally distinct rhythm- and pattern-generating microcircuits. We suggest that: (1) the onset of activity in preinspiratory Dbx1+ neurons initiates each inspiration (Kam et al., 2013aKam K. Worrell J.W. Janczewski W.A. Cui Y. Feldman J.L. Distinct inspiratory rhythm and pattern generating mechanisms in the preBötzinger complex.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 9235-9245Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); (2) Dbx1+ and SST+ inspiratory neurons primarily act in a patterning role to transmit activity from rhythmogenic preBötC neurons (Revill et al., 2015Revill A.L.

These crosses resulted in mice expressing ChR2 in Dbx1+ neurons (Dbx1-Cre;ChR2(H134R)-tdTomato, abbreviated as Dbx1-ChR2) or SST+ neurons (Sst-IRES-Cre;ChR2(H134R)-tdTomato, abbreviated as SST-ChR2), with tdTomato as a fluorescent reporter. The expression patterns of ChR2 in Dbx1-ChR2 and SST-ChR2 mice were analyzed via SST immunostaining and tdTomato fluorescence. In brainstems of adult Dbx1-ChR2 mice at the rostrocaudal level of the preBötC, tdTomato fluorescence extended from the area directly lateral to the hypoglossal (XII) motor nucleus to the ventral medullary surface encompassing the intermediate reticular formation (IRt) and the ventral respiratory column (VRC) (Figure 1A), consistent with previous data in newborn mice (Gray, 2013Gray P.A.

The nucleus ambiguus (NA) and XII motor nucleus were devoid of tdTomato fluorescence (Figure 1A), as in newborn mice (Gray, 2013Gray P.A.

Ventral to NA (Figure 1A, square segment) was a subset of Dbx1+ glutamatergic preBötC SST-expressing respiratory neurons (Figures 1B and 1C), essential for breathing movements in adult rats (Tan et al., 2008Tan W.

In the ventrolateral medulla of adult Dbx1-ChR2 (Figures 1A–1C) and SST-ChR2 (Figures 1D and 1F) mice, tdTomato predominately overlapped with the distribution of SST-expressing neurons that demark the preBötC (Stornetta et al., 2003Stornetta R.L.

We recorded the extracellular firing patterns of respiratory-modulated preBötC neurons in Dbx1-ChR2 and SST-ChR2 adult mice that responded to preBötC photostimulation, which would include neurons directly excited by light and those receiving input from these neurons. We observed three types of neuronal firing patterns: preinspiratory (pre-I), inspiratory (I), and postinspiratory (post-I) (Figure 2). In Dbx1-ChR2 mice (Figure 2, middle column), in response to bilateral preBötC short-pulse photostimulation (SPP; 100–300 ms pulse; 473 nm) at any point in the respiratory cycle, we observed increased firing in all preinspiratory (n = 12/12 units in 3 mice) and most inspiratory (n = 4/7 units in 3 mice) preBötC neurons, with no responsive postinspiratory (n = 0/9 units in 3 mice) preBötC neurons; these results are consistent with the firing patterns of identified preBötC Dbx1+ neurons in vitro (Picardo et al., 2013Picardo M.C.

Physiol. 2013; 591: 2687-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In SST-ChR2 mice (Figure 2, right column), all recorded inspiratory (n = 5/5 units in 2 mice) and all postinspiratory (n = 5/5 units in 2 mice) preBötC neurons, but no preinspiratory (n = 0/15 units in 2 mice) preBötC neurons, were responsive to bilateral preBötC SPP at any point in the respiratory cycle. All light-induced increases in firing rate were proportional to laser intensity (Figure S1). Typically, 3–6 mW laser power initiated a burst of action potentials, but no motor output, whereas >6 mW could trigger motor output in Dbx1-ChR2 mice (Figure S1). Unless otherwise specified, laser power was set at 7 mW. In Dbx1-ChR2 mice, we examined the role of preBötC Dbx1+ neurons by photostimulation at different phases of expiration (phase: 0.0–0.8) or inspiration (phase: 0.9–1.0). For stimulation during each phase, we measured genioglossus electromyographic activity (GGEMG) and calculated the resultant phase shift (phase shift = perturbed cycle duration/control cycle duration). If a stimulus had no effect, the perturbed cycle duration would equal the control cycle duration, and the phase shift would be 1.0 (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). No ectopic inspiratory burst could be generated by bilateral preBötC SPP during early expiration or postinspiration (phase: 0.0–0.1; phase shift: 1.0 ± 0.03; p = 0.7, n = 5). Bilateral preBötC SPP during mid- (phase: 0.2–0.7) or late- (phase: 0.8) expiration elicited an ectopic inspiratory burst and shifted the respiratory phase (n = 5; Figure 3A) without affecting GGEMG burst amplitude (p = 0.9, n = 5), inspiratory duration (TI; p = 0.1, n = 5), or expiratory duration (TE) of the following cycle (p = 1.0, n = 5). Bilateral preBötC SPP in early inspiration (phase: 0.9) increased GGEMG burst amplitude to 315% ± 32% of control (p = 3 × 10−5, n = 6; Figure 3B) in the stimulus cycle and decreased GGEMG burst amplitude in the following poststimulus cycle to 79% ± 14% of control (p = 0.004, n = 6; Figure 3B). The strongest phase resetting was at phase 0.3 (phase shift: 0.6 ± 0.03; p < 10−16, n = 5; Figure 3J, red curve). For SPP during expiration in Dbx1-ChR2 mice, the latency between photostimulation onset and ectopic inspiratory burst onset was inversely related to the phase of stimulation, with stimulation at later expiratory phases requiring less time to evoke a response. Bilateral preBötC SPP produced ectopic bursts with delays of 235 ± 28 ms early in mid-expiration (phase: 0.2–0.3; n = 5), 131 ± 35 ms in the middle of mid-expiration (phase: 0.4–0.6; p = 8 × 10−4, n = 5), and 59 ± 29 ms late in mid-expiration (phase 0.7; p = 0.007, n = 5). The Breuer-Hering inflation reflex (BHIR) is a powerful lung inflation-induced, vagus nerve-mediated reflex that results in a sustained apnea mediated by fast synaptic inhibition within the preBötC (Janczewski et al., 2013Janczewski W.A. Tashima A. Hsu P. Cui Y. Feldman J.L. Role of inhibition in respiratory pattern generation.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 5454-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Sherman et al., 2015Sherman D. Worrell J.W. Cui Y. Feldman J.L. Optogenetic perturbation of preBötzinger complex inhibitory neurons modulates respiratory pattern.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In Dbx1-ChR2 mice, apnea caused by a prolonged BHIR could be broken by bilateral preBötC SPP. Apnea induced by a 10 s lung inflation using constant positive air pressure (CPAP; 8 cm H2O) in control ranged from 8.8 to 10.1 s (9.6 ± 0.5 s, n = 5; Figure 3C, top traces). Bilateral preBötC SPP at 3.0 ± 0.8 s after onset of CPAP induced an inspiratory burst within 145 ± 37 ms of laser onset (Figure 3C, bottom traces; n = 5), indicating that acute activation of this neuronal subpopulation can trigger inspiration despite inhibitory effects of vagal pulmonary afferents. Bilateral preBötC long-pulse photostimulation (LPP; 4–10 s pulse; 473 nm) increased GGEMG burst amplitude to 402% ± 58% of control in the stimulus cycle (p = 4 × 10−7, n = 5; Figure 3D) but did not significantly change the amplitude in poststimulus cycles (p = 0.07, n = 5). Breathing frequency (f) increased to 120% ± 6% of control when baseline f < 100 breaths per minute (bpm; 83 ± 9 bpm, p = 0.003, n = 7) due to a decrease in TE to 83% ± 7% of control (p = 0.01, n = 7) with no significant change in TI (p = 0.3, n = 7). At higher baseline f > 100 bpm (112 ± 5 bpm, n = 5), f did not change (p = 0.5, n = 5). In no cases were apneas induced (n = 5). During bilateral preBötC LPP (5 mW) in Dbx1-ChR2 mice, preinspiratory neurons continued their firing except for a refractory period of ∼0.3 s that followed endogenous bursts (n = 4 units in 3 mice; Figure 3E, top traces). Postinspiratory neurons were not responsive to photostimulation (n = 4 units in 3 mice; Figure 3E, bottom traces). Thus, preBötC photostimulation in Dbx1-ChR2 mice can evoke ectopic inspiratory bursts during the expiratory phase or during the apnea induced by the BHIR, as well as increase GGEMG when delivered during an ongoing inspiratory cycle. We suggest that the effects on burst timing and output pattern in response to preBötC photostimulation in Dbx1-ChR2 mice result from photostimulation-induced firing of Dbx1+ preinspiratory and inspiratory neurons. In SST-ChR2 mice, bilateral preBötC SPP during early inspiration had presumptively excitatory effects on inspiratory motor output pattern, increasing GGEMG burst amplitude to 275% ± 43% compared to control (p = 4 × 10−5, n = 6; Figure 3G) in the stimulus cycle and decreasing GGEMG burst amplitude in the following cycle to 83% ± 13% of control (p = 0.007, n = 6). In contrast to these effects, bilateral preBötC SPP during mid- (phase: 0.3–0.7) or late- (phase: 0.8) expiration significantly delayed the onset of the next inspiration and did not trigger ectopic inspiratory bursts, unlike in Dbx1-ChR2 mice (Figure 3F, compare to Figure 3A). The longest delay was at phase 0.7 (phase shift: 1.4 ± 0.03; p < 10−16, n = 6; Figure 3J, blue curve); TE of the next cycle was not lengthened (p = 0.4, n = 6). Bilateral preBötC LPP in SST-ChR2 mice initiated in early inspiration triggered a single augmented burst that in GGEMG was 257% ± 31% larger than control (p = 8 × 10−6, n = 4; Figure 3H), followed by apnea for the remaining stimulation (Figure 3H). With 4 s LPP, the length of stimulation-induced apnea was 3.8 ± 0.1 s (n = 4; Figure 3H), and poststimulation f was not significantly different from prestimulus f (p = 1.0, n = 4). Preinspiratory neurons were silenced (n = 12 units in 2 mice; Figure 3I), while postinspiratory neurons (n = 5 units in 2 mice; Figure 3I) fired throughout the photostimulation-induced apnea. We suggest that the excitatory effect on motor output pattern in response to preBötC photostimulation in SST-ChR2 mice results from the photostimulation-induced firing of SST+ inspiratory neurons, while an inhibitory pathway may be activated by photostimulation-induced firing of preBötC SST+ postinspiratory neurons or by activation of postinspiratory neurons postsynaptic to preBötC excitatory SST+ neurons. In SST-ChR2 mice, preinspiratory neurons were silenced during photostimulation-induced apnea, suggesting strong activation of an inhibitory pathway affecting rhythmogenic neurons. We first investigated whether this response was due to the release of SST within the preBötC (Martel et al., 2012Martel G. Dutar P. Epelbaum J. Viollet C. Somatostatinergic systems: an update on brain functions in normal and pathological aging.Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2012; 3: 154Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In SST-ChR2 mice, bilateral injection into preBötC of the broad-spectrum SST receptor antagonist cyclosomatostatin (CSST) increased GGEMG burst amplitude to 374% ± 56% of control (p = 0.007, n = 4), decreased f to 54% ± 10% of control (p = 0.0004, n = 4; Figure 4A1 ), increased TE to 226% ± 52% of control (p = 0.01, n = 4; Figure 4A1), and did not change TI significantly (p = 0.2, n = 4; Figure 4A1). With 4 s LPP, the length of photostimulation-induced apnea was 4.0 ± 0.04 s (n = 4; Figure 4A3), i.e., there was no significant effect of CSST administration on the apnea elicited by bilateral preBötC LPP (Figure 4A2). Poststimulation f did not change significantly (p = 0.8, n = 4). We confirmed that CSST effectively blocked SST receptors, as respiratory responses induced by SST administration into the preBötC (where f decreased to 29% ± 1% of control) were fully antagonized by CSST (n = 4; Figure S2). As the apnea induced by bilateral preBötC LPP in SST-ChR2 mice was not mediated by the local release of SST, we investigated the involvement of inhibition mediated by local release within preBötC of GABA and/or glycine from the terminals of GABAergic SST+ neurons with somas either inside or outside the preBötC (Wei et al., 2012Wei X.Y. Zhao Y. Wong-Riley M.T. Ju G. Liu Y.Y. Synaptic relationship between somatostatin- and neurokinin-1 receptor-immunoreactive neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex of rats.J. Neurochem. 2012; 122: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and/or GABAergic/glycinergic neurons postsynaptic to glutamatergic SST+ neurons. In SST-ChR2 mice, after bilateral injection of the GABAA and glycine receptor antagonists bicuculline and strychnine (B+S) into preBötC, bilateral preBötC LPP no longer produced apnea or prolongation of TE (p = 0.4, n = 4; Figure 4B2 and 4B3, compare with Figures 3H and 4A2) and did not change GGEMG burst amplitude (p = 0.4, n = 4), f (p = 0.2, n = 4), or TI (p = 0.8, n = 4) compared to controls (Figure 4B3), suggesting that the photostimulation-induced apnea was mediated by local release within preBötC of GABA and/or glycine. In SST-ChR2 mice after B+S injection, bilateral preBötC SPP during mid- (phase: 0.2–0.7) or late- (phase: 0.8) expiration produced ectopic inspiratory bursts, altered the respiratory phase (n = 6; Figure 4B1), but did not change the subsequent TE (p = 0.9, n = 6). The strongest phase resetting was at phase 0.2 (shift to 0.4 ± 0.02: p < 10−16, n = 6; Figure 4C, light blue curve), while no ectopic inspiratory burst could be generated in early expiration (phase 0.0–0.1, shift to 1.0 ± 0.03; p = 0.3, n = 6). These data are similar to the effects produced by bilateral preBötC SPP during mid- or late-expiration in Dbx1-ChR2 mice (Figure 3A), indicating that local inhibition is not involved in the initiation of ectopic inspiratory bu"

As a white rot fungus with lignocellulose degradation ability, L. edodes has the potential for application in the utilization of agriculture straw resources. Here, we report its 41.8-Mb genome, encoding 14,889 predicted genes. Through a phylogenetic analysis with model species of fungi, the evolutionary divergence time of L. edodes and Gymnopus luxurians was estimated to be 39 MYA. The carbohydrate-active enzyme genes in L. edodes were compared with those of the other 25 fungal species, and 101 lignocellulolytic enzymes were identified in L. edodes, similar to other white rot fungi. Transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of genes encoding two cellulases and 16 transcription factor was up-regulated when mycelia were cultivated for 120 minutes in cellulose medium versus glucose medium. Our results will foster a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of lignocellulose degradation and provide the basis for partial replacement of wood sawdust with agricultural wastes in L. edodes cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W2476984584,"Understanding how membrane nanoscale organization controls transmembrane receptors signaling activity remains a challenge. We studied interferon-γ receptor (IFN-γR) signaling in fibroblasts from homozygous patients with a T168N mutation in IFNGR2. By adding a neo-N-glycan on IFN-γR2 subunit, this mutation blocks IFN-γ activity by unknown mechanisms. We show that the lateral diffusion of IFN-γR2 is confined by sphingolipid/cholesterol nanodomains. In contrast, the IFN-γR2 T168N mutant diffusion is confined by distinct actin nanodomains where conformational changes required for Janus-activated tyrosine kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) activation by IFN-γ could not occur. Removing IFN-γR2 T168N-bound galectins restored lateral diffusion in lipid nanodomains and JAK/STAT signaling in patient cells, whereas adding galectins impaired these processes in control cells. These experiments prove the critical role of dynamic receptor interactions with actin and lipid nanodomains and reveal a new function for receptor glycosylation and galectins. Our study establishes the physiological relevance of membrane nanodomains in the control of transmembrane receptor signaling in vivo.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJjOTljYzVmYzdiMTM4NTBhZWJhMDI0NmU4NWMwNWFkZiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MDk2MDQ0fQ.FZA2MFhNP_HX56z_wJ-QFf_e4Cmuzj43fL2Wvvj1JyImIdiDWZVh5jbkFdCTocj7ZDyrpXIYcbApl_haqGdXdOGu-p4RSVgHuMyhCreX7zw91QfHCAeGqd0uPW_eWALINNfbU9o3yvhZW75Acv_przduD1Gsxi9iUi8piLRaDaIGz0liSObDX8NmtMyTMhtoCUkd_YS-ydRZWsDBvV8UIjlqLXekmRiQQ8wsV1ezAdFksH4XSHaFPJDq8kK5M12kLymdwcCUi5bDMmVvmFApSnZZiLc9RN2uc1ZBwsEgVkG1Cg2IS6l8asjTaw_UsD4QV4teptWMr5tW1XCJxr6B3A(mp4, (49.63 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2502752116,"Loss- and gain-of-function mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) underlie two distinct neurological syndromes with strikingly similar features, but the synaptic and circuit-level changes mediating these shared features are undefined. Here we report three novel signs of neural circuit dysfunction in three mouse models of MECP2 disorders (constitutive Mecp2 null, mosaic Mecp2+/−, and MECP2 duplication): abnormally elevated synchrony in the firing activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, an impaired homeostatic response to perturbations of excitatory-inhibitory balance, and decreased excitatory synaptic response in inhibitory neurons. Conditional mutagenesis studies revealed that MeCP2 dysfunction in excitatory neurons mediated elevated synchrony at baseline, while MeCP2 dysfunction in inhibitory neurons increased susceptibility to hypersynchronization in response to perturbations. Chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation (DBS), recently shown to rescue hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in Mecp2+/− (Rett) mice, also rescued all three features of hippocampal circuit dysfunction in these mice."

https://openalex.org/W2499449813,"Myelination occurs selectively around neuronal axons to increase the efficiency and velocity of action potentials. While oligodendrocytes are capable of myelinating permissive structures in the absence of molecular cues, structurally permissive neuronal somata and dendrites remain unmyelinated. Utilizing a purified spinal cord neuron-oligodendrocyte myelinating co-culture system, we demonstrate that disruption of dynamic neuron-oligodendrocyte signaling by chemical cross-linking results in aberrant myelination of the somatodendritic compartment of neurons. We hypothesize that an inhibitory somatodendritic cue is necessary to prevent non-axonal myelination. Using next-generation sequencing and candidate profiling, we identify neuronal junction adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2) as an inhibitory myelin-guidance molecule. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the somatodendritic compartment directly inhibits myelination and suggest a model in which broadly indiscriminate myelination is tailored by inhibitory signaling to meet local myelination requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2501641743,"In eukaryotic cells, heme production is tightly controlled by heme itself through negative feedback-mediated regulation of nonspecific 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS1), which is a rate-limiting enzyme for heme biosynthesis. However, the mechanism driving the heme-dependent degradation of the ALAS1 protein in mitochondria is largely unknown. In the current study, we provide evidence that the mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease ClpXP, which is a heteromultimer of CLPX and CLPP, is involved in the heme-dependent degradation of ALAS1 in mitochondria. We found that ALAS1 forms a complex with ClpXP in a heme-dependent manner and that siRNA-mediated suppression of either CLPX or CLPP expression induced ALAS1 accumulation in the HepG2 human hepatic cell line. We also found that a specific heme-binding motif on ALAS1, located at the N-terminal end of the mature protein, is required for the heme-dependent formation of this protein complex. Moreover, hemin-mediated oxidative modification of ALAS1 resulted in the recruitment of LONP1, another ATP-dependent protease in the mitochondrial matrix, into the ALAS1 protein complex. Notably, the heme-binding site in the N-terminal region of the mature ALAS1 protein is also necessary for the heme-dependent oxidation of ALAS1. These results suggest that ALAS1 undergoes a conformational change following the association of heme to the heme-binding motif on this protein. This change in the structure of ALAS1 may enhance the formation of complexes between ALAS1 and ATP-dependent proteases in the mitochondria, thereby accelerating the degradation of ALAS1 protein to maintain appropriate intracellular heme levels."

Regrowing serotonin axons do not follow the pathways left by degenerated axons. The regrown axons release serotonin and their regrowth is correlated with recovery in behavioral tests. Axons that sustain damage in the adult mammalian brain are thought to fail to regrow, and this failure is believed, at least in part, to result from factors in the matrix of tissue that broadly inhibit axonal growth (Chew et al., 2012Chew D.J.

Rather, the limited functional rewiring that occurs after brain trauma is proposed to be dominated by the compensatory local sprouting of neighboring uninjured axons (Tuszynski and Steward, 2012Tuszynski M.H.

Following a lesion of serotonin axons in the rat neocortex with a high dose of amphetamine, there is a gradual reappearance of serotonin-immunoreactive axons over many months (Molliver et al., 1990Molliver M.E. Berger U.V. Mamounas L.A. Molliver D.C. O’Hearn E. Wilson M.A. Neurotoxicity of MDMA and related compounds: anatomic studies.Ann. N Y Acad.

While suggestive, these fixed-tissue studies have been inconclusive. They were unable to distinguish degeneration and subsequent regrowth from a transient amphetamine-mediated downregulation of serotonin levels within intact axons. Nor have these studies been able to distinguish potential regrowth from damaged axons from compensatory sprouting of local undamaged axons. Thus, the regrowth of serotonin axons remains an important topic of debate that speaks to a central view in the recovery of neural function. Here, in order to observe the serotonin axon recovery process directly and disambiguate the results from fixed-tissue studies, we have performed in vivo two-photon time-lapse imaging over many months in adult serotonin transporter-EGFP BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) transgenic mice (Gong et al., 2003Gong S.

A gene expression atlas of the central nervous system based on bacterial artificial chromosomes.Nature. 2003; 425: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) following several forms of injury. The serotonin system in the CNS has been broadly implicated in the regulation of affect, aggression, sexual behavior, sleep, and cognitive function (Muller and Jacobs, 2010Muller C.P. Jacobs B. Handbook of the Behavioral Neurobiology of Serotonin. Academic Press, 2010Google Scholar). It originates in the raphe nuclei, a distributed series of cell groups with weakly defined boundaries flanking the midline of the midbrain and brainstem (Hornung, 2003Hornung J.-P. The human raphe nuclei and the serotonergic system.J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2003; 26: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The rostral group of raphe nuclei, consisting of the supralemniscal nucleus, median raphe, and dorsal raphe, contains serotonin neurons that project widely to forebrain structures, including all regions of the neocortex, the striatum, olfactory bulbs, amygdala, and hippocampus. In the rodent, the axons of the rostral raphe nuclei are almost entirely thin and unmyelinated (Azmitia and Gannon, 1983Azmitia E. Gannon P.

Microglial response to degeneration of serotonergic axon terminals.Glia. 1994; 11: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Those fibers that innervate the neocortex form a C shape when observed in the sagittal plane: they pass through the lateral hypothalamus and the basal forebrain, running in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). The fibers then turn dorsally, elaborating branches that form projections to the frontal cortex, and then turn posteriorly to innervate parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices, respectively (Figure 1, upper right panel). Electron microscopy of neocortical serotonin axons shows that the vast majority of vesicle-bearing varicosities in serotonin axons have no corresponding postsynaptic density laden with serotonin receptors. This suggests that the action of serotonin on its targets is mainly produced by slow, diffuse volume transmission rather than fast, localized synaptic transmission (Hornung, 2003Hornung J.-P.

Mice received eight intraperitoneal injections over 4 days of either para-chloroamphetamine (PCA; 20 mg/kg), a particularly toxic amphetamine derivative (Fuller, 1992Fuller R.W. Effects of p-chloroamphetamine on brain serotonin neurons.Neurochem. Res. 1992; 17: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), or saline. After a recovery period ranging from 1 day to 6 months, the mice were sacrificed and sagittal slices near the midline were processed for immunohistochemistry using antibodies against EGFP, to show serotonin neurons, and NeuN, to reveal a subset of neuronal cell bodies. Figure 1 shows exemplar confocal images taken 1 day after PCA treatment, revealing swollen serotonin axons in neocortical regions and the rostral MFB (see also Figure S2 for in vivo imaging of swollen axons 1 day after PCA treatment). There were no swollen axons seen in the more proximal portions of the axonal trajectory, including those that pass through the linear nucleus of the raphe, the posterior hypothalamus, and the more caudal portions of the MFB (data not shown). This pattern is consistent with the early stages of retrograde axonal degeneration and is congruent with well-established literature on amphetamine-induced degeneration of serotonin axons in rats, which has gone to great lengths to demonstrate the hallmarks of degeneration, including swollen, irregular axons (Molliver et al., 1990Molliver M.E. Berger U.V. Mamounas L.A. Molliver D.C. O’Hearn E. Wilson M.A. Neurotoxicity of MDMA and related compounds: anatomic studies.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1990; 600 (discussion 661–664.): 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and has used immuno-electron microscopy to show amphetamine-evoked destruction of microtubules and degenerated mitochondria in such axons (Adori et al., 2011Adori C. Low P. Andó R.D. Gutknecht L. Pap D. Truszka F. Takács J. Kovács G.G. Lesch K.P. Bagdy G.

Figure 2 shows representative images taken 1 week after PCA or saline treatment, starting with the serotonergic cell bodies of origin in the dorsal raphe nucleus, continuing with their long C-shaped projection through the MFB, and ending in the occipital cortex. These images reveal that PCA treatment produced a significant loss of serotonin axons in all of the cortical regions examined as well as in the rostral aspect of the MFB. Importantly, neither the cell bodies of origin in dorsal raphe (Figures 2A and 2B) nor the initial portion of the axons running in the linear nucleus of the raphe or the posterior hypothalamus was affected by PCA treatment, while the caudal portion of the MFB showed a small degree of axonal loss. When the period after PCA treatment was extended to 3 and 6 months, substantial recovery of EGFP immunoreactivity was observed in the MFB and neocortex (Figures 2C and S3). These findings are consistent with previous reports using amphetamine treatment in rats followed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies directed against serotonin (Molliver et al., 1990Molliver M.E. Berger U.V. Mamounas L.A. Molliver D.C. O’Hearn E. Wilson M.A. Neurotoxicity of MDMA and related compounds: anatomic studies.Ann. N Y Acad.

Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2788-2803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because here the serotonin axons are visualized with an antibody to untethered cytoplasmic EGFP, the present results argue against a model in which intact serotonin axons are merely depleted of serotonin by PCA treatment and then slowly refill. Could PCA treatment somehow lead to a reduction of EGFP expression driven by the promoter of the serotonin transporter? As one way to address this question, we measured serotonin transporter immunoreactivity in proximal, undegenerated axons coursing through the linear nucleus of the raphe complex, 1 week after saline or PCA treatment. No difference in serotonin transporter immunoreactivity was seen between saline and PCA treatment in these images (saline, 55.8% ± 1.7% area occupied by serotonin transporter signal; PCA, 60.1% ± 6.7% area, n = 3/group). By contrast, PCA treatment produced a profound decrease in serotonin transporter immunoreactivity in the same distal locations where EGFP signal was lost, such as somatosensory cortex (saline, 32.9% ± 1.4% area occupied by serotonin transporter signal; PCA, 4.3% ± 0.4% area, n = 7/group). As a further test of the possibility that apparent serotonin axon degeneration was merely an artifact of reduced Slc6a4-EGFP expression in intact axons, we injected the virus AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP-WPRE-pA into the dorsal raphe of serotonin transporter-Cre mice to produce surface membrane labeling (Tsai et al., 2009Tsai H.-C. Zhang F. Adamantidis A. Stuber G.D. Bonci A. de Lecea L. Deisseroth K. Phasic firing in dopaminergic neurons is sufficient for behavioral conditioning.Science. 2009; 324: 1080-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) of the complete extent of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons, including their axonal projections to the neocortex. Following a 1 month period to allow for expression and transport of EYFP, mice received PCA or saline treatment and were then sacrificed 1 week or 3 months thereafter. This was followed by triple-label immunohistofluorescence to reveal EYFP and serotonin transporter expression in axons of the frontal and somatosensory cortex, as well as NeuN to reveal neuronal nuclei (Figure S4). Because Cre recombinase activity is irreversible, this treatment yields a mouse in which EYFP expression is no longer subject to regulation, being under the control of the strong, ubiquitous EF1a promoter rather than the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene. In layer 1 of somatosensory cortex, in a saline-treated mouse sacrificed 1 week later, 23.7% ± 1.0% of the area was occupied by serotonin transporter immunoreactivity and 12.3% ± 0.9% of the area was occupied by EYFP immunoreactivity (n = 8 mice). Of the EYFP-positive pixels, 79.6% ± 3.9% were also serotonin transporter positive. This indicates that virally introduced EYFP selectively labeled approximately half of the serotonin transporter-positive axons. Importantly, 1 week after PCA treatment, serotonin transporter immmunoreactivity was reduced to 7.0% ± 0.9% and EYFP immunoreactivity was reduced to 3.6% ± 0.3% (n = 6). When these measurements were repeated on a cohort of mice allowed to recover for 3 months after PCA treatment, we observed partial recovery in both measures (serotonin transporter, 14.2% ± 1.0%; EYFP, 8.1% ± 0.4%, n = 9), similar to the degree of recovery seen using Slc6a4-EGFP mice (Figure 2). These results argue that PCA treatment does indeed cause massive degeneration of serotonin axons rather than merely appearing to do so through an effect on EGFP expression in Slc6a4-EGFP mice. To assess the dynamics of axonal regrowth and allow for within-animal comparisons, we employed chronic in vivo two-photon microscopy. Here, we define regrowth as growth of axons in response to injury, irrespective of the cellular origin of growth (that is, either from damaged or undamaged axons). Cranial windows were implanted overlying the somatosensory cortex of serotonin transporter-EGFP mice. After an 11-day recovery period, a z stack encompassing layer 1 was acquired, followed by a second pre-treatment image taken 3 days later. Then, mice were injected with either PCA (n = 9) or saline (n = 4). Imaging of the same region was then continued at weekly intervals for as long as possible, ranging from 13 to 29 weeks. Figure 3A shows exemplar maximal z stack projections and 3D axon tracings for PCA- and saline-treated mice. When total axonal length was calculated for each time point, it was revealed that PCA treatment produced a large decrease measured 1 week after treatment (25.5% ± 3.5% of baseline, mean ± SEM, n = 9), while the saline group was unaffected (98.0% ± 1.6%, n = 4). The PCA-treated group showed a slow, gradual recovery (64% ± 6.2% at t = 19 weeks, n = 4) that can be appreciated in a movie showing 3D projections and rotations of exemplar analyzed volumes (Movie S1). In contrast, total axonal length of the saline-treated group was highly stable (91.8% ± 4.8%, t = 19 weeks, n = 3). Similar results were found when the total number of axonal branch points was scored (Figure S5). To further analyze the recovery process, axonal segments were assigned to several groups: surviving axons, which persisted after treatment; sprouted axons, which grew as new branches elaborated from those axons that survived; and new axons, which only appeared in the field of view at some point after treatment. Figure 3B shows that the slow recovery of total axonal length following PCA treatment is almost entirely due to the presence of new axons. The rate of local sprouting from surviving axons following PCA is very low (5.2% ± 1.1% at t = 19 weeks, n = 4) and is comparable to the rate seen in saline-treated control mice (4.3% ± 1.6% at t = 19 weeks, n = 3; Figure 3B). The axons that survive PCA treatment are not merely dying slowly: of the surviving axons present 1 week after PCA, 96.5% are still present at week 19, slightly more than the 81.7% survival rate of saline-treated axons over this same period. Most of the new serotonin axons appearing after PCA treatment completely traverse the imaged volume from one weekly time point to the next. This is consistent with the overall rostrocaudal course of serotonin axons in neocortical layer 1 (Hornung, 2003Hornung J.-P. The human raphe nuclei and the serotonergic system.J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2003; 26: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). However, in some cases, new axons can be observed to gradually extend within the field of view from week to week, as shown in Figure 4. Sprouting axons can also be seen to gradually extend within the field of view. Are the new axons that appear in the imaged volume after PCA treatment growing from the shafts or severed ends of damaged axons, or are they axons that have sprouted from survivors adjacent to our field of view and have then grown to invade the imaged volume? While we cannot make definitive statements about events outside of the field of view, numerical considerations make this latter scenario unlikely. Within the imaged volume, 13 weeks after PCA treatment, there is an average of 123.6 ± 14.2 new axons, but only 15.4 ± 2.7 sprouted axons, and of those sprouted axons, only 4.4 ± 0.9 exit the imaged volume. Because some sprouted axons branch and both branches can exit the imaged volume, the average total number of sprouted axon exit events is slightly higher, 5.3 ± 1.2. Thus, for sprouted axons outside of the imaged volume to account for the new axons we see invading the imaged volume, the sprouting rate in adjacent regions would have to be consistently ∼23-fold higher than in the imaged volume. While this is formally possible, we favor the more parsimonious explanation, consistent with the immunohistochemical images of the entire forebrain (Figures 1 and 2), that new axons originate from deeper structures and represent some form of long-distance regrowth. What we can’t determine definitively is whether these new axons ultimately originate from the neurons that sustain damage or from uninjured neurons. The new axons that repopulate the field of view are not transient structures: of the new axons present 6 weeks after PCA treatment, 100% are still present at week 19. Thus, it appears that recovery of serotonin axons does not result from overgrowth followed by pruning, at least within our 29-week-long maximum monitoring period. This pattern is similar to the initial development of serotonin fiber innervation of the neocortex in late embryonic and early postnatal life, which also lacks significant overgrowth and pruning (Lidov and Molliver, 1982Lidov H.G. Molliver M.E. An immunohistochemical study of serotonin neuron development in the rat: ascending pathways and terminal fields.Brain Res. Bull. 1982; 8: 389-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Might the stress of PCA treatment cause Slc6a4-EGFP neurons to change their transmitter phenotype? To address this question, we performed in vivo time-lapse imaging weekly following PCA treatment, sacrificed the mouse, and processed the somatosensory cortex for immunohistochemistry with an antibody directed against the serotonin transporter. When the field of view from the in vivo imaging was recovered, it was revealed that surviving, sprouted, and new axons were all serotonin transporter immunopositive (Figure S6), arguing against a change in neurotransmitter phenotype. Examination of exemplar images indicates that the new axons repopulating the field of view following PCA treatment do not grow along surviving axons, nor are they guided by blood vessels (Figures 3 and 4). The former conclusion is supported by an analysis of axon neighbor relations (Figures 5A and 5B ). When the distance to the nearest axon is calculated for every point along every axon in the field of view, we found that PCA treatment increases the mean distance to the nearest neighbor by a factor of 2.39 ± 0.18 at week 1 (compared to the pre-treatment time point at −1 week), and this distance decreases gradually as the field of view is repopulated with new axons (a factor of 1.36 ± 0.07 at week 19). Importantly, a histogram showing the distribution of nearest neighbor distances fails to show a peak at distances <1 μm at any time point, indicating that serotonin axons rarely contact each other, as would be expected if the surviving axons served as a scaffold for new axons. In fact, the changes in the nearest neighbor histogram after PCA treatment are most consistent with a model in which new axons actively avoid contact with surviving axons, sprouting axons, or each other. When new axons enter the field of view after PCA treatment, they generally recapitulate the morphology of both surviving axons and control saline-treated axons. Figure 5C shows that the tortuosity of new axons is similar to that of these other populations (tortuosity ratio of new axons at week 19 is 1.18 ± 0.02 compared with 1.16 ± 0.04 for surviving PCA-treated axons at week 19 and 1.12 ± 0.01 for surviving saline-treated axons at week 19). Likewise, the density of axonal varicosities in new axons is similar to surviving axons and saline-treated controls (data for week 19 are as follows: survived, 0.43 ± 0.01 varicosities/μm; new, 0.42 ± 0.01 varicosities/μm; p = 0.58). When new axons enter the field of view, do they grow along pathways that had previously been established by degenerated fibers? Casual observation of the trajectories of new axons suggests that they do not (Figure 3A). To quantitate this impression, an overlap index was calculated in which each new traced axon at week 27 was separately scored for overlap in 3D space with each traced degenerated axon present at week −1 in two different PCA-treated mice. We set a criterion that >80% of the points along a new axon must overlap those of a degenerated axon in order for the axon to be scored as overlapping. We further set the overlap scoring zone to have a radius of 4.5 μm around each point in the new axon to account for small changes in the geometry and orientation of the imaged volume over 29 weeks. This analysis showed that only 3% of the new axons overlapped with degenerated axon pathways. These parameters are valid because when they are applied to comparing surviving axons at week 27 with the same axons at week −1, 96% of the surviving axons are scored as overlapping. Thus, very few axons grow along pathways abandoned by degenerating axons. Indeed, it is possible that even the 4% positive score for new axons represents new axons are that are growing close to, but not precisely along, the pathways of degenerated axons, since the limits of our imaging technique do not allow us to make this distinction. Importantly, these results further argue against a model in which intact serotonin axons are merely depleted of serotonin by PCA treatment (or depleted of EGFP in Slc6a4-EGFP mice) and then slowly refill, as this mechanism would be expected to yield a high degree of overlap between new axons and “degenerated” axon pathways. The location in 3D space of axons was calculated as a distribution of probability densities in three dimensions for both PCA- and saline-treated mice (Figure S7). In saline-treated mice, these 3D axon distributions were remarkably stable across time (from −1 to 21 weeks), consistent with stable exemplar images (Figure 3). In PCA-treated mice, these distributions were also remarkably similar, even though PCA produced a large reduction in axon density followed by a slow recovery. This consistency indicates that even though the new axons do not grow in the exact same locations where degenerated axons previously ran, overall, the new axons that underlie recovery after PCA recapitulate the 3D axon distribution density of the pre-lesion state. Are there any morphological or positional criteria that can be used to predict which axons will survive PCA treatment? Axons at the week −1 pre-treatment time point were divided into two groups: those that would later survive PCA treatment and those that would degenerate. When these groups were compared, neither tortuosity nor varicosity density differed between them (tortuosity of surviving axons was 1.15 ± 0.01 compared with 1.16 ± 0.0 for those that would later degenerate; varicosity density of surviving axons was 0.44 ± 0.02 varicosities/μm compared with 0.42 ± 0.01 varicosities/μm for those that would later degenerate). In addition, the finding that 3D axon distribution density was not affected by PCA treatment (compare week −1 and week 1; Figure S7) suggests that an axon’s position in 3D space within our imaging volume was not a predictor of whether it would survive. We have shown that the new axons that enter the field of view following PCA treatment are serotonin transporter immunopositive (Figure S6), express a normal density of axonal varicosities, and recapitulate the overall spatial distribution of pre-lesion axons (Figures 5 and S7). However, this does not prove that these axons have the capacity to release serotonin when action potentials invade. To address this question, a stimulating electrode was placed in the medial forebrain bundle of anesthetized serotonin-transporter-EGFP mice, and a carbon fiber microelectrode for serotonin fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) (Hashemi et al., 2012Hashemi P. Dankoski E.C. Lama R. Wood K.M. Takmakov P. Wightman R.M. Brain dopamine and serotonin differ in regulation and its consequences.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Prior experiments have only identified efficient coverage based on orthogonal maps. Here we used two-photon calcium imaging to reveal an alternative arrangement for OD and SF maps in macaque V1; their gradients run parallel but with unique spatial periods, whereby low-SF regions coincide with monocular regions. Next we mapped receptive fields and found surprisingly precise micro-retinotopy that yields a smaller point-image and requires more efficient inter-map geometry, thus underscoring the significance of map relationships. While smooth retinotopy is constraining, studies suggest that it improves both wiring economy and the V1 population code read downstream. Altogether, these data indicate that connectivity within V1 is finely tuned and precise at the level of individual neurons."

Recent reports indicate that cholecystokinin-positive basket cells (CCK BCs), GABAergic interneurons (INs) expressing the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R), can mediate target-specific inhibition of PNs, both at the cellular (Varga et al., 2010Varga C.

From the basal nucleus of the amygdala (BA), distinct populations of PNs project to the prelimbic (PL) or infralimbic (IL) subdivisions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (Hoover and Vertes, 2007Hoover W.B.

PL-projecting BA PNs (PNPLs) are activated in vivo during states of high fear, whereas IL-projecting BA PNs (PNILs) increase their activity in low fear states, such as with acquisition of fear extinction (Senn et al., 2014Senn V.

Recent data indicate that the switch between high fear and low fear states is mediated by a shift of activity in these two amygdala output pathways (Senn et al., 2014Senn V. Wolff S.B. Herry C.

Zieglgänsberger W. et al.The endogenous cannabinoid system controls extinction of aversive memories.Nature. 2002; 418: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar), and the opposing behavioral functions of projections from the BA to PL or IL during fear extinction (Senn et al., 2014Senn V. Wolff S.B. Herry C. Grenier F. Ehrlich I. Gründemann J. Fadok J.P. Müller C. Letzkus J.J. Lüthi A. Long-range connectivity defines behavioral specificity of amygdala neurons.Neuron. 2014; 81: 428-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that local BA CCKLs differentially inhibit defined subpopulations of BA PNs to balance the activity of functionally distinct BA→mPFC output pathways. To probe the functional organization of CCKL-mediated inhibition onto defined populations of PNs, we performed paired whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of CCKLs and retrogradely labeled projection neurons (n = 225 pairs) in acute brain slices of CCK-IN-GFP mice (Figure 1). Selective GFP expression in CCK INs was obtained via an intersectional approach, using CCK-IRES-Cre::Dlx-Flp::RCE:dual reporter mice (Miyoshi et al., 2010Miyoshi G. Hjerling-Leffler J. Karayannis T.

Genetic fate mapping reveals that the caudal ganglionic eminence produces a large and diverse population of superficial cortical interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1582-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). GFP+ neurons with somatic size similar to mPFC-projecting neurons were considered as CCKLs (median [25th/75th percentile]; PNmPFC: 918.8 [763.4/1,063] μm2, n = 122 cells, N = 3 mice; CCKL: 848.0 [754.8/977.9] μm2, n = 103, N = 3; Figures S1A–S1D) and targeted for subsequent experiments. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the majority of GFP+ CCKLs were immunopositive for CCK (mean ± SEM; 89.0% ± 1.9%, N = 4, Figures S1E and S1F). To record from identified PNILs and PNPLs in ex vivo brain slices, we stereotaxically injected fluorescent latex retrobeads into IL or PL (Figure S2) prior to patch-clamp experiments. Paired recordings from GFP+ CCKLs and bead+ PNs revealed robust, picrotoxin-sensitive GABAergic synaptic transmission from CCKLs to both IL- and PL-projecting PNs (Figures 1A–1D) with a success rate of 96.3% for CCKL→PNIL and 98.0% for CCKL→PNPL synapses. Connection probability was similar for both PN populations (CCKL→PNIL: 58.5%, n = 82 tested pairs, N = 34; CCKL→PNPL: 55.9%, n = 143, N = 51; Fisher’s exact test p > 0.05; Figure 1E). Synaptic conductance did not significantly differ between CCKL→PNIL and CCKL→PNPL pairs in response to single presynaptic action potentials (APs) or 50 ms, 100 Hz AP bursts (Figures 1F and 1G). Interestingly, in contrast to hippocampal CCK BCs (Hefft and Jonas, 2005Hefft S. Jonas P. Asynchronous GABA release generates long-lasting inhibition at a hippocampal interneuron-principal neuron synapse.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1319-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) latency at CCKL→PNIL/PNPL synapses was short (CCKL→PNIL: 2.13 (1.78/2.36) ms, n = 18, N = 14; CCKL→PNPL: 1.91 (1.69/2.24) ms, n = 27, N = 20; Mann-Whitney U [MWU] test p > 0.05) with low jitter (CCKL→PNIL: 0.10 (0.07/0.17) ms, n = 18, N = 14; CCKL→PNPL: 0.10 (0.08/0.18) ms, n = 27, N = 20; MWU test p > 0.05) but did not differ between groups (Figures 1H and 1I). Comprehensive analysis of cellular properties revealed significant differences between large and small CCKs but not between CCKLs targeting IL- or PL-projecting PNs (Table S1). Together, these results indicate that, on the level of unitary synaptic connectivity and strength, distinct subpopulations of mPFC-projecting BA PNs receive uniform, reliable, and rapid inhibition by CCKLs. Given the evidence for CB1R-dependent mechanisms in CCK BC-mediated micro-circuit regulation (Armstrong and Soltesz, 2012Armstrong C. Soltesz I. Basket cell dichotomy in microcircuit function.J.

Nicoll R.A. Endogenous cannabinoids mediate retrograde signalling at hippocampal synapses.Nature. 2001; 410: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). To induce DSI, we depolarized postsynaptic PNs to 0 mV for 5 s to mimic strong postsynaptic activity (Figure 2A) (Ohno-Shosaku et al., 2001Ohno-Shosaku T. Maejima T. Kano M.

Nicoll R.A. Endogenous cannabinoids mediate retrograde signalling at hippocampal synapses.Nature. 2001; 410: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). At many CB1R-expressing IN synapses, this acts as a trigger for postsynaptic endocannabinoid synthesis and release, causing a transient CB1R-mediated suppression of presynaptic release probability (Galarreta et al., 2004Galarreta M. Erdélyi F. Szabó G. Hestrin S. Electrical coupling among irregular-spiking GABAergic interneurons expressing cannabinoid receptors.J.

Endocannabinoid signaling in the brain.Science. 2002; 296: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). In the BA, an immediate and robust decrease of IPSC amplitude following postsynaptic depolarization was recorded, which was completely prevented by application of the CB1R antagonist AM251 (Figure 2B). While such DSI was observed at all CCKL→PNIL synapses, CCKL→PNPL synapses were less frequently inhibited (Figures 2C and 2D). On average, DSI magnitude significantly differed between PNs in a target-specific manner (CCKL→PNIL: 99.6 (89.1/100)% DSI, n = 20, N = 14; CCKL→PNPL: 65.0 (19.5/96.9)%, n = 32, N = 21; MWU test p < 0.001; Figure 2E). To investigate whether a more physiological spike pattern could elicit DSI, we additionally tested postsynaptic high-frequency firing activity (Poisson-distributed spike trains, mean frequency: 100 Hz, 5 s) to induce DSI at CCKL→PNIL synapses. Indeed, we found a significant reduction of CCKL-IPSCs in four out of five CCKL→PNIL pairs (69.8% ± 13.3% DSI, n = 4, N = 4; paired t test p < 0.05; Figure S3). Next, given the asymmetric expression of DSI at CCKL→PNIL/PL synapses, we investigated whether other forms of short-term plasticity might also differ in a projection target-specific manner. We found no difference in paired-pulse ratio between both populations (two presynaptic action potentials, frequency: 20 Hz, Figure 3A). However, upon delivery of brief presynaptic high-frequency bursts (100 Hz, 5 pulses), CCKL→PNIL synapses exhibited stronger depression compared to CCKL→PNPL synapses (Figure 3B). Thus, in contrast to the uniform synaptic connectivity and strength, dynamic short-term regulation of CCKL synapses depends on the identity of the postsynaptic target cell with CCKL→PNIL synapses being more susceptible to activity-dependent suppression. Next, we examined whether pre- or postsynaptic factors underlie the target specificity of DSI. To explore whether differential CB1R expression or tonic CB1R activation could account for alterations in DSI, we applied the CB1R agonist WIN55,212-2 (5 μM) during paired recordings. We observed that CCKL-IPSCs onto PNILs and PNPLs were depressed with similar effect in magnitude and time course (Figure 3C). No correlation of suppression by WIN with DSI magnitude was observed (Figure 3D). Additionally, we tested whether CCKL synapses are tonically suppressed by endocannabinoids. However, application of AM251 (10 μM) had no effect on IPSC amplitude for either postsynaptic target (CCKL→PNIL 12.2% ± 19.6%, n = 5, N = 5; CCKL→PNPL 0.5% ± 22.1%, n = 4, N = 4). Together, these results suggest that lower DSI levels in PL-projecting cells cannot be explained by a presynaptic mechanism. To address whether postsynaptic differences in IL- versus PL-projecting PNs could account for altered endocannabinoid signaling, we examined the subcellular abundance of the endocannabinoid synthesis (diacylglycerol lipase α [DGLα]) and degradation (monoacylglycerol lipase [MGL]) enzymes for 2-arachidonylglycerol, the main endocannabinoid contributing to DSI at central synapses (Hashimotodani et al., 2008Hashimotodani Y. Ohno-Shosaku T. Maejima T. Fukami K. Kano M.

Using immunohistochemistry, we first quantified co-expression of the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) in CB1R+ bouton-like appositions on the somatic surface of Choleratoxin-B labeled IL- and PL-projecting PNs (Figures S4A and S4B). 98.2% ± 0.5% of CB1R+ varicosities were also immunopositive for VGAT, indicating that the vast majority of somatic CB1R+ contacts reflect synapses from GABAergic neurons. Consistent with the electrophysiological results, no difference in the number of double-labeled VGAT+ and CB1R+ bouton-like appositions could be detected between IL- and PL-projecting PNs (Figures S4A–S4C and Tables S2 and S3). Next, we quantified DGLα+ puncta closely apposed to CB1R+ varicosities at the cell surface of postsynaptic IL- or PL-projecting PNs. Blinded analysis revealed a circa 50% higher number of DGLα+ puncta in IL-projecting cells (PNIL: 48.0 (38.3/55.8) spots per soma, n = 64, N = 3; PNPL: 32.0 (25.0/39.0), n = 88, N = 3; MWU test, p < 0.0001; Figures 4A–4C). Similar results were obtained in triple-labeled sections in which somatic DGLα+ appositions to double-labeled VGAT+/CB1R+ boutons were quantified (Figures S4D–S4F). To confirm the postsynaptic location of DGLα, we performed co-immunolabeling of DGLα with gephyrin, a postsynaptic structural protein at GABAergic synapses (Sassoè-Pognetto et al., 2000Sassoè-Pognetto M. Panzanelli P. Sieghart W. Fritschy J.M. Colocalization of multiple GABA(A) receptor subtypes with gephyrin at postsynaptic sites.J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 420: 481-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Again, a significantly higher number of DGLα+ spots were co-localized with gephyrin in IL-projecting PNs (Figures S4G–S4I). Further, the higher numbers of DGLα+ puncta in PNILs could not be accounted to a difference in PN cell size, as both IL- and PL-projecting PNs exhibited similar somatic surface areas (PNIL: 1,045 ± 14 μm2, n = 41, N = 4; PNPL: 1,036 ± 23 μm2, n = 42, N = 3; t test p > 0.05). In contrast to higher postsynaptic DGLα abundance in PNILs, preliminary data show no difference in presynaptic MGL expression in perisomatic CB1R+ terminals surrounding IL- and PL-projecting PNs (Figures S4J–S4L). Since the balance of activity between IL- and PL-projecting pathways was previously described to be important for fear extinction learning (Senn et al., 2014Senn V. Wolff S.B. Herry C. Grenier F. Ehrlich I. Gründemann J. Fadok J.P. Müller C. Letzkus J.J. Lüthi A. Long-range connectivity defines behavioral specificity of amygdala neurons.Neuron. 2014; 81: 428-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the difference in DGLα abundance would change after fear learning. We submitted mice injected with Choleratoxin-B to either of the two prefrontal projection targets to an auditory fear conditioning paradigm (Figure 4D). All mice acquired a strong fear memory during the conditioning session (Figure 4E) and were sacrificed 24 hr later for immunohistochemical analysis. Quantification of DGLα+ puncta apposing CB1R+ varicosities at the cell surface of postsynaptic IL- or PL-projecting PNs revealed a significantly higher number at PNIL somata (Figures 4F–4H; PNIL: 61.0 (44.0/76.8) spots per soma, n = 56, N = 4; PNPL: 40.5 (32.5/58.0), n = 44, N = 3; MWU test p < 0.001). Consistent with our previous results obtained in naive animals, the number of DGLα+ puncta in IL-projecting PNs was circa 50% higher compared to PL-projecting PNs. Thus, the difference in DGLα abundance in distinct BA→mPFC output pathways reflects a fear learning-independent cellular property of defined BA PNs. Together, these findings indicate that, in the BA, behavioral specificity of projection pathways is regulated by postsynaptic differences in endocannabinoid signaling. CB1R-expressing CCKL INs have been proposed to be major regulators of fear extinction circuits (Marsicano et al., 2002Marsicano G. Wotjak C.T. Azad S.C. Bisogno T. Rammes G. Cascio M.G. Hermann H. Tang J. Hofmann C. Zieglgänsberger W. et al.The endogenous cannabinoid system controls extinction of aversive memories.Nature. 2002; 418: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar) and emotional states (Freund, 2003Freund T.F. Interneuron Diversity series: Rhythm and mood in perisomatic inhibition.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 489-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). However, until recently, investigating their functional role was impeded by a lack of specific genetic tools. Using an intersectional genetic strategy, we were able to selectively label CCK-expressing basket cells with GFP. Although about 10% of GFP+ CCKLs were not immunopositive for CCK, none of these cells displayed a pyramidal-like morphology, confirming that we specifically target interneurons with our intersectional strategy. Most likely, these neurons were not labeled by the CCK antibody due to very low somatic abundance of CCK peptide at the time of the experiment. Using this mouse model, we were able to achieve targeted paired patch-clamp recordings of GFP-expressing CCKLs and defined subpopulations of retrogradely labeled BA PNs. This approach enabled us to study the cell-type-specific organization of CCKL-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission in fear and extinction micro-circuits of the mouse amygdala. We observed that CCKLs uniformly inhibit IL- and PL-projecting BA PNs with similar connectivity and synaptic strength. Furthermore, we did not discover any differences in CCKL spiking properties targeting either postsynaptic cell type. These data suggest that CCKLs targeting mPFC-projecting PNs are a rather homogeneous population of INs and that asymmetries promoting fine-tuning of output pathways might not be present on the level of unitary connectivity. Yet, we cannot exclude that amygdala CCKLs, similar to CB1R+/VGlut3+ CCK INs in entorhinal cortex (Varga et al., 2010Varga C. Lee S.Y. Soltesz I. Target-selective GABAergic control of entorhinal cortex output.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 822-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), could connect onto PNs projecting to brain regions other than mPFC in a target-specific manner. Also, as recently reported for hippocampal INs (Dudok et al., 2015Dudok B. Barna L. Ledri M. Szabó S.I. Szabadits E. Pintér B. Woodhams S.G. Henstridge C.M. Balla G.Y. Nyilas R. et al.Cell-specific STORM super-resolution imaging reveals nanoscale organization of cannabinoid signaling.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), it is possible that amygdala CCKLs are heterogeneous on a molecular level, e.g., with regard to the subcellular distribution of CB1R protein. In contrast to the unitary connectivity and synaptic strength, we found that the dynamics of CCKL-mediated synaptic inhibition onto distinct subpopulations of BA PNs are cell type and pathway specific. Both short-term synaptic plasticity and DSI are different for BA neurons projecting to either IL or PL. CCKL→PNIL synapses exhibit depressing short-term plasticity dynamics in response to presynaptic high-frequency spike trains, as well as reliable and robust activity-dependent DSI. In contrast, CCKL→PNPL synapses show facilitating compound IPSCs and a significantly weaker DSI. In line with the notion that PNILs and PNPLs are contacted by a similar population of CCKLs, we found that CCKL→PNIL synapses and CCKL→PNPL synapses are equally suppressed in response to the application of an exogenous CB1R antagonist and that the content of the presynaptic endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme MGL is similar at CCKL→PNIL and CCKL→PNPL synapses. In contrast, the postsynaptic abundance of the endocannabinoid-synthesizing enzyme DGLα is significantly greater in PNILs compared to PNPLs, suggesting that cell-type-specific differences in the postsynaptic endocannabinoid signaling machinery are an important factor determining the specificity of CB1R-mediated signaling in amygdala micro-circuits. Possible mechanisms for this differential postsynaptic expression of DGLα in IL- and PL-projecting BA PNs remain elusive. One conceivable mechanism could involve neurotrophic factors, which allow for retrograde signaling over long distances from the axon to the soma and can influence synaptic plasticity, as well as transcriptional programs that define neuronal identities (Zweifel et al., 2005Zweifel L.S. Kuruvilla R. Ginty D.D. Functions and mechanisms of retrograde neurotrophin signalling.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In particular, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in extinction learning and IL function (Bredy et al., 2007Bredy T.W. Wu H. Crego C. Zellhoefer J. Sun Y.E. Barad M.

Martinowich K. Activity-dependent signaling: influence on plasticity in circuits controlling fear-related behavior.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 36: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BDNF has been shown to directly interact with the endocannabinoid signaling machinery at cortical synapses (Lemtiri-Chlieh and Levine, 2010Lemtiri-Chlieh F. Levine E.S.

The previous study showed cilostazol modulates autophagy by increasing beclin1, Atg5 and LC3-II expressions, and depletes intracellular Aβ accumulation. This study elucidated the mechanisms through which cilostazol modulates the autophagic degradation of Aβ in neurons. In N2a cells, cilostazol (10-30 μM), significantly increased the expression of P-AMPKα (Thr 172) and downstream P-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) (Ser 79) as did resveratrol (SIRT1 activator), or AICAR (AMPK activator), which were blocked by KT5720, compound C (AMPK inhibitor), or sirtinol. Furthermore, phosphorylated-mTOR (Ser 2448) and phosphorylated-P70S6K (Thr 389) expressions were suppressed, and LC3-II levels were elevated in association with decreased P62/Sqstm1 by cilostazol. Cilostazol increased cathepsin B activity and decreased p62/SQSTM 1, consequently decreased accumulation of Aβ1-42 in the activated N2aSwe cells, and these results were blocked by sirtinol, compound C and bafilomycin A1 (autophagosome blocker), suggesting enhanced autophagosome formation by cilostazol. In SIRT1 gene-silenced N2a cells, cilostazol failed to increase the expressions of P-LKB1 (Ser 428) and P-AMPKα, which contrasted with its effect in negative control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA duplex. Further, N2a cells transfected with expression vectors encoding pcDNA SIRT1 showed increased P-AMPKα expression, which mimicked the effect of cilostazol in N2a cells; suggesting cilostazol-stimulated expressions of P-LKB1 and P-AMPKα were SIRT1-dependent. Unlike their effects in N2a cells, in HeLa cells, which lack LKB1, cilostazol and resveratrol did not elevate SIRT1 or P-AMPKα expression, indicating cilostazol and resveratrol-stimulated expressions of SIRT1 and P-AMPKα are LKB1-dependent. In conclusion, cilostazol upregulates autophagy by activating SIRT1-coupled P-LKB1/P-AMPKα and inhibiting mTOR activation, thereby decreasing Aβ accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2477747662,"Lateral intraparietal (LIP) neurons encode a vast array of sensory and cognitive variables. Recently, we proposed that the flexibility of feature representations in LIP reflect the bottom-up integration of sensory signals, modulated by feature-based attention (FBA), from upstream feature-selective cortical neurons. Moreover, LIP activity is also strongly modulated by the position of space-based attention (SBA). However, the mechanisms by which SBA and FBA interact to facilitate the representation of task-relevant spatial and non-spatial features in LIP remain unclear. We recorded from LIP neurons during performance of a task that required monkeys to detect specific conjunctions of color, motion direction, and stimulus position. Here we show that FBA and SBA potentiate each other's effect in a manner consistent with attention gating the flow of visual information along the cortical visual pathway. Our results suggest that linear bottom-up integrative mechanisms allow LIP neurons to emphasize task-relevant spatial and non-spatial features."
https://openalex.org/W2499836862,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating, progressive disease with poor survival rates and limited treatment options. Upregulation of αvβ6 integrins within the alveolar epithelial cells is a characteristic feature of IPF and correlates with poor patient survival. The pro-fibrotic cytokine TGFβ1 can upregulate αvβ6 integrin expression but the molecular mechanisms driving this effect have not previously been elucidated. We confirm that stimulation with exogenous TGFβ1 increases expression of the integrin β6 subunit gene (ITGB6) and αvβ6 integrin cell surface expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. TGFβ1-induced ITGB6 expression occurs via transcriptional activation of the ITGB6 gene, but does not result from effects on ITGB6 mRNA stability. Basal expression of ITGB6 in, and αvβ6 integrins on, lung epithelial cells occurs via homeostatic αvβ6-mediated TGFβ1 activation in the absence of exogenous stimulation, and can be amplified by TGFβ1 activation. Fundamentally, we show for the first time that TGFβ1-induced ITGB6 expression occurs via canonical Smad signalling since dominant negative constructs directed against Smad3 and 4 inhibit ITGB6 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, disruption of a Smad binding site at -798 in the ITGB6 promoter abolishes TGFβ1-induced ITGB6 transcriptional activity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that TGFβ1 stimulation of lung epithelial cells results in direct binding of Smad3, and Smad4, to the ITGB6 gene promoter within this region. Finally, using an adenoviral TGFβ1 over-expression model of pulmonary fibrosis we demonstrate that Smad3 is crucial for TGFβ1-induced αvβ6 integrin expression within the alveolar epithelium in vivo. Together, these data confirm that a homeostatic, autocrine loop of αvβ6 integrin activated TGFβ1-induced ITGB6 gene expression regulates epithelial basal αvβ6 integrin expression, and demonstrates that this occurs via Smad-dependent transcriptional regulation at a single Smad binding site in the promoter of the β6 subunit gene. Active TGFβ1 amplifies this pathway both in vitro and in vivo, which may promote fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2501231664,"Background The Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) was developed to timely recognise clinically deteriorating hospitalised patients. However, the ability of the MEWS in predicting serious adverse events (SAEs) in a general hospital population has not been examined prospectively. The aims were to (1) analyse protocol adherence to a MEWS protocol in a real-life setting and (2) to determine the predictive value of protocolised daily MEWS measurement on SAEs: death, cardiac arrests, ICU-admissions and readmissions. Methods All adult patients admitted to 6 hospital wards in October and November 2015 were included. MEWS were checked each morning by the research team. For each critical score (MEWS ≥ 3), the clinical staff was inquired about the actions performed. 30-day follow-up for SAEs was performed to compare between patients with and without a critical score. Results 1053 patients with 3673 vital parameter measurements were included, 200 (19.0%) had a critical score. The protocol adherence was 89.0%. 18.2% of MEWS were calculated wrongly. Patients with critical scores had significant higher rates of unplanned ICU admissions [7.0% vs 1.3%, p < 0.001], in-hospital mortality [6.0% vs 0.8%, p < 0.001], 30-day readmission rates [18.6% vs 10.8%, p < 0.05], and a longer length of stay [15.65 (SD: 15.7 days) vs 6.09 (SD: 6.9), p < 0.001]. Specificity of MEWS related to composite adverse events was 83% with a negative predicting value of 98.1%. Conclusions Protocol adherence was high, even though one-third of the critical scores were calculated wrongly. Patients with a MEWS ≥ 3 experienced significantly more adverse events. The negative predictive value of early morning MEWS < 3 was 98.1%, indicating the reliability of this score as a screening tool."

https://openalex.org/W2492604038,"Mitochondria are essential organelles that adapt to stress and environmental changes. Among the nutrient signals that affect mitochondrial form and function is iron, whose depletion initiates a rapid and reversible decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis through unclear means. Here we demonstrate that, unlike the canonical iron-induced alterations to transcript stability, loss of iron dampens the transcription of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins with no change to transcript half-life. Using mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that these transcriptional changes are accompanied by dynamic alterations to histone acetylation and methylation levels that are largely reversible upon readministration of iron. Moreover, histone deacetylase inhibition abrogates the decreased histone acetylation observed upon iron deprivation and restores normal transcript levels at genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Collectively, we demonstrate that deprivation of an essential nutrient induces transcriptional repression of organellar biogenesis involving epigenetic alterations."
https://openalex.org/W2497670483,"The influence of the sex steroid hormones progesterone and estradiol on physiology and behavior during menstrual cycles and pregnancy is well known. Several studies indicate that olfactory performance changes with cyclically fluctuating steroid hormone levels in females. Knowledge of the exact mechanisms behind how female sex steroids modulate olfactory signaling is limited. A number of different known genomic and non-genomic actions that are mediated by progesterone and estradiol via interactions with different receptors may be responsible for this modulation. Next generation sequencing-based RNA-Seq transcriptome data from the murine olfactory epithelium (OE) and olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) revealed the expression of several membrane progestin receptors and the estradiol receptor Gpr30. These receptors are known to mediate rapid non-genomic effects through interactions with G proteins. RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining results provide evidence for progestin and estradiol receptors in the ORNs. These data support the hypothesis that steroid hormones are capable of modulating the odorant-evoked activity of ORNs. Here, we validated this hypothesis through the investigation of steroid hormone effects by submerged electro-olfactogram and whole cell patch-clamp recordings of ORNs. For the first time, we demonstrate that the sex steroid hormones progesterone and estradiol decrease odorant-evoked signals in the OE and ORNs of mice at low nanomolar concentrations. Thus, both of these sex steroids can rapidly modulate the odor responsiveness of ORNs through membrane progestin receptors and the estradiol receptor Gpr30."

The human POR mutation A287P presents with disordered sexual development and skeletal malformations. Difficult recombinant expression and purification of this POR mutant suggested that the protein was less stable than WT. The activities of cytochrome P450 17A1, 19A1, and 21A2, critical in steroidogenesis, were similar using our purified, full-length, unmodified A287P or WT POR, as were those of several xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochromes P450, indicating that the A287P protein is functionally competent in vitro, despite its functionally deficient phenotypic behavior in vivo. Differential scanning calorimetry and limited trypsinolysis studies revealed a relatively unstable A287P compared with WT protein, leading to the hypothesis that the syndrome observed in vivo results from altered POR protein stability. The crystal structures of the soluble domains of WT and A287P reveal only subtle differences between them, but these differences are consistent with the differential scanning calorimetry results as well as the differential susceptibility of A287P and WT observed with trypsinolysis. The relative in vivo stabilities of WT and A287P proteins were also examined in an osteoblast cell line by treatment with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, showing that the level of A287P protein post-inhibition is lower than WT and suggesting that A287P may be degraded at a higher rate. Current studies demonstrate that, unlike previously described mutations, A287P causes POR deficiency disorder due to conformational instability leading to proteolytic susceptibility in vivo, rather than through an inherent flavin-binding defect.

POR catalyzes the one-at-a-time two-electron transfer from NADPH in the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism of many endobiotics, such as retinoic acid, vitamin D3, lanosterol, estrogens and androgens, as well as many xenobiotics, including both drugs and environmental toxins (1Pandey A.V.

It can be predicted that alteration in POR activity or stability can lead to a myriad of defects. All of the ∼50 human endoplasmic reticulum resident (microsomal) CYPs are dependent upon POR for electron shuttling between NADPH and the CYP-heme, the reduction of which is necessary for O2 binding. The biosynthesis of endobiotics, such as steroids, bile acids, and arachidonic acid metabolites, and the metabolism of many xenobiotics require cytochromes P450. POR is also essential for electron delivery to heme oxygenase (3Schacter B.A. Nelson E.B. Marver H.S. Masters B.S.

Although early embryogenesis was unaffected, many defects appeared in the mouse embryos by embryonic day 10.5. A mouse model in which POR was conditionally deleted in hepatocytes showed a marked induction of liver CYPs (up to 5-fold depending upon age of the mice) (7Henderson C.J. Otto D.M. Carrie D. Magnuson M.A. McLaren A.W. Rosewell I. Wolf C.R. Inactivation of the hepatic cytochrome P450 system by conditional deletion of hepatic cytochrome P450 reductase.J. Biol.

The mice were fertile and normal in gross appearance and growth rate, but as they aged, the homozygotes exhibited increases in liver weight, hepatic lipidoses, decreased cholesterol metabolism, and profound decreases in in vivo drug metabolism (7Henderson C.J.

These observations suggested that POR deficiency could have significant deleterious effects in humans. Indeed, a multiplicity of POR mutations were identified in human patients in which embryonic development was severely affected (9Flück C.E. Tajima T. Pandey A.V. Arlt W. Okuhara K. Verge C.F. Jabs E.W. Mendonça B.B. Fujieda K. Miller W.L. Mutant P450 oxidoreductase causes disordered steroidogenesis with and without Antley-Bixler syndrome.Nat.

In addition to severe steroidogenic defects, POR deficiency (PORD) also caused both craniofacial and long bone developmental anomalies, a bone phenotype resembling Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS) (9Flück C.E. Tajima T. Pandey A.V. Arlt W. Okuhara K. Verge C.F. Jabs E.W. Mendonça B.B. Fujieda K. Miller W.L. Mutant P450 oxidoreductase causes disordered steroidogenesis with and without Antley-Bixler syndrome.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 228-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). ABS with normal steroidogenesis is the result of gain-of-function mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor type 2 (FGFR2), whereas ABS with accompanying steroidogenic defects is due to defects in POR. The disordered steroidogenesis in PORD is attributable to the inability of POR to capably transfer electrons to steroidogenic CYPs, but the role of POR in bone development remains of interest. A conditional knock-out of the POR gene in bone mesenchyme recapitulated the ABS-like bone phenotype in mice and indicated that POR may affect the FGF receptor signaling pathway (11Panda S.P.

Electron transfer by human wild-type and A287P mutant P450 oxidoreductase assessed by transient kinetics: functional basis of P450 oxidoreductase deficiency.Biochem. J. 2015; 468: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we found a complete complement of both flavins, FAD and FMN, determined by HPLC, and little compromise in a variety of enzymatic activities, either intrinsic to POR or requiring interaction with CYPs of various specificities. This result begged the question of how a POR mutation that appeared essentially normal in vitro could contribute to the phenotype seen in human patients. Difficulty in reproducibly isolating the full-length A287P mutant protein heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli suggested its inherent instability and led to the modification of our standard expression and purification protocol to achieve purification of the A287P variant. Once obtained in pure form, however, it remained active upon low temperature storage and during various measurements. Herein, we have applied a variety of biophysical techniques to evaluate the properties of the A287P variant of POR and expressed it in both bacterial and mammalian cell systems to determine its behavior in a more physiologically pertinent environment. In addition, we have performed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and compared the crystal structure of this mutant protein with the vulnerability of POR to proteolytic digestion by trypsin to explain the difference between the A287P POR variant and WT enzyme, demonstrating that subtle conformational changes in A287P may lead to protein instability and increased temperature sensitivity in vivo.

Our initial purification of the full-length A287P variant followed our established protocol, but the yield was extremely low and irreproducible as compared with WT. This behavior suggested that the A287P variant was somewhat less stable than any of the other polymorphic variants we had previously expressed and purified. Therefore, the established protocol was modified and optimized to express and purify A287P to homogeneity (Table 1). The WT enzyme, although successfully expressed and purified by the methods utilized previously, was also taken through the identical modified protocol for direct comparison. Specifically, the growth temperature was lowered to 23 °C, and a lower IPTG concentration (62.5 μm) was used for the induction of the protein. In addition, a higher detergent (0.5% Triton X-100) concentration was required to extract the full-length A287P as compared with the WT POR and other POR variants, suggesting a tighter association of A287P with the E. coli membrane. Although slower growth conditions were necessary for A287P expression in E. coli, but not for WT protein, the modified protocol improved the yield of WT protein as well. The yields of WT and A287P proteins purified via this protocol were similar and averaged ∼2.5 mg of protein/liter of culture.TABLE 1Modifications to standard purification protocol for A287PStandard protocolA287P modificationGrowth temperature28 °C23 °CIPTG concentration500 μm62.5 μmGrowth time24 h48 hDetergent concentration0.1% Triton X-1000.5% Triton X-100 Open table in a new tab The full-length A287P protein was expressed without tagging modification, purified as a single band on SDS-PAGE, similar to WT full-length POR (Fig. 1A), and characterized by its spectral properties (Fig. 1B) and flavin content (Table 2). Spectral analysis of A287P in the visible region, where protein-bound flavins absorb, showed no observable differences compared with WT protein (Fig. 1B). Protein-bound flavin content, both FAD and FMN, was measured using HPLC (25Marohnic C.C. Panda S.P. Martásek P. Masters B.S. Diminished FAD binding in the Y459H and V492E Antley-Bixler syndrome mutants of human cytochrome P450 reductase.J. Biol.

The ratio of FAD and FMN to protein was calculated to be ∼1:1:1, suggesting the mutation has, at most, a minimal effect on flavin content (Table 2). Although a recent publication reported that the A287P mutation in POR leads to deficiency in both FAD and FMN bound (24Jin Y. Chen M. Penning T.M. Miller W.L. Electron transfer by human wild-type and A287P mutant P450 oxidoreductase assessed by transient kinetics: functional basis of P450 oxidoreductase deficiency.Biochem. J. 2015; 468: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), it is not difficult to imagine that a point mutation could affect the conformation of the folded protein without affecting the binding affinity of either or both the flavins (see “Discussion”). Furthermore, the A287P mutation is not localized near either of the flavin-binding sites.TABLE 2Flavin content of POR WT and A287P purified proteinsProteinFADFMNWT1.1 ± 0.21 ± 0.1A287P0.9 ± 0.21 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Despite the lack of dramatic effect of the A287P point mutation on the content of FAD, the entry flavin for electrons from NADPH, the Km for NADPH, and the Ki for NADP+ were determined to eliminate the possibility that any kinetic effects could result from alterations in the binding of the electron donor. The A287P mutation had little or no effect on these kinetically determined parameters using cytochrome c as the electron acceptor to measure electron flow-through the reductase molecule (Km NADPH = ∼5.9 μm and ∼5.0 μm for WT and A287P, respectively) or alteration in the inhibition constant of NADP+ (Ki NADP+ = ∼16.1 μm and ∼18.4 μm for WT and A287P, respectively, determined at 25 °C). The data clearly show that any effect of the A287P mutation is minimal and that the behavior of this variant in vivo cannot be attributed to a defect in the hydride transfer step from NADPH to FAD. A further comparison of kinetic parameters between WT and A287P POR was made using stopped-flow spectrophotometry to measure the rates of flavin reduction at 450 nm. Table 3 shows the fast and slow phase rate constants for reduction of these POR enzymes by NADPH at 25 °C. The initial fast phase of flavin reduction, which reflects hydride transfer to FAD and one-electron reduction of FMN (28Gutierrez A. Lian L.Y. Wolf C.R. Scrutton N.S. Roberts G.C. Stopped-flow kinetic studies of flavin reduction in human cytochrome P450 reductase and its component domains.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1964-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), was 34% lower for A287P compared with WT protein. The second slower phase of reduction, representing the conversion of two electron-reduced to four electron-reduced hydroquinone proteins (28Gutierrez A. Lian L.Y. Wolf C.R. Scrutton N.S. Roberts G.C.

These data indicate that, despite full complementation with both flavins, other alterations in the A287P mutation are affecting the rate of electron transfer from NADPH into the entry flavin, FAD, to a minor degree. The degree of rate decrease may or may not affect the physiological rates of interaction with CYPs or other redox partners that involve much lower rates of electron transfer in catalytic turnover.TABLE 3Rate constants for POR flavin reduction by NADPHWTA287Ps−1s−1Fast phase, k114.31 ± 2.169.35 ± 1.01Slow phase, k21.59 ± 0.411.01 ± 0.44 Open table in a new tab The rate of reduction of the artificial electron acceptor, cytochrome c, by POR, using NADPH as the electron donor under steady state conditions, was decreased 30% in the A287P mutant compared with the WT protein (1850 ± 240 and 2760 ± 270 min−1 for A287P and WT, respectively). Cytochrome c reductase activity not only measures the rate at which POR can donate electrons, but also reflects the internal rate of electron transfer between the flavins because electron transfer to this acceptor occurs from FMN. The observed decrease in reduction of cytochrome c observed for A287P compared with WT is in agreement with the stopped-flow data in which both rate constants are decreased 34–36% in A287P. The ability of A287P to support CYP activity was tested in CYPs that metabolize two different classes of compounds, i.e. steroids and xenobiotics, to determine whether A287P might interact differently with various CYPs. Using reconstitution systems unique to each steroidogenic cytochrome P450, WT and A287P proteins were interacted with purified CYP17A1 and CYP21A2. The choice of these two CYPs was made to examine the possibility that the phenotype observed with A287P, i.e. sexual ambiguities in these patients (9Flück C.E. Tajima T. Pandey A.V. Arlt W.

The data show that there are no significant differences in activity between WT and A287P in supporting CYP 17α- or 21-hydroxylase activities with progesterone (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, these constructs were tested with purified human aromatase (CYP19A1), the CYP responsible for estrogen biosynthesis from testosterone (Fig. 2B). As with CYP17A1 and CYP21A2, little or no differences were detected among activities supported by WT or A287P proteins. Thus, when assaying the ability of POR A287P to support these CYP activities in an in vitro assay system, POR A287P appeared to be essentially as competent as WT. Drug and xenobiotic metabolism by the WT and A287P proteins was also assessed. BFC is metabolized primarily by CYP3a11 in mouse liver, although other CYPs will also contribute to BFC conversion to HFC. Metabolism of BFC was measured in a reconstituted system using liver microsomes isolated from mice with liver-specific deletion of POR (8Gu J. Weng Y. Zhang Q.-Y. Cui H. Behr M. Wu L. Yang W.

This unique system allows us to measure CYP activity in a native milieu, eliminating any contribution of activity by endogenous POR. In addition, many CYPs are up-regulated in this mouse model, allowing robust CYP activity that is easily detectable. As shown in Fig. 2C, there is little to no difference between WT and A287P metabolism of BFC. The cell model BTC1A2_POR was used for the co-expression of the POR variant A287P with human CYP1A2. The biplasmid system in BTC strains allows the expression of full-length proteins at a stoichiometry that reflects that found in vivo (23Moutinho D. Marohnic C.C. Panda S.P. Rueff J. Masters B.S.

https://openalex.org/W2512218172,"The radioprotective capacity of a rationally-designed Mn2+-decapeptide complex (MDP), based on Mn antioxidants in the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, was investigated in a mouse model of radiation injury. MDP was previously reported to be extraordinarily radioprotective of proteins in the setting of vaccine development. The peptide-component (DEHGTAVMLK) of MDP applied here was selected from a group of synthetic peptides screened in vitro for their ability to protect cultured human cells and purified enzymes from extreme damage caused by ionizing radiation (IR). We show that the peptides accumulated in Jurkat T-cells and protected them from 100 Gy. MDP preserved the activity of T4 DNA ligase exposed to 60,000 Gy. In vivo, MDP was nontoxic and protected B6D2F1/J (female) mice from acute radiation syndrome. All irradiated mice treated with MDP survived exposure to 9.5 Gy (LD70/30) in comparison to the untreated mice, which displayed 63% lethality after 30 days. Our results show that MDP provides early protection of white blood cells, and attenuates IR-induced damage to bone marrow and hematopoietic stem cells via G-CSF and GM-CSF modulation. Moreover, MDP mediated the immunomodulation of several cytokine concentrations in serum including G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-10 during early recovery. Our results present the necessary prelude for future efforts towards clinical application of MDP as a promising IR countermeasure. Further investigation of MDP as a pre-exposure prophylactic and post-exposure therapeutic in radiotherapy and radiation emergencies is warranted."

Visual information impinging on the photoreceptors in the retina is initially processed in the retinal circuit (Field and Chichilnisky, 2007Field G.D. Chichilnisky E.J. Information processing in the primate retina: circuitry and coding.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) before being relayed via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) on to the primary visual cortex. Processing of visual shape continues downstream in a set of cortical areas in the ventral cortical pathway in the temporal lobe (DiCarlo et al., 2012DiCarlo J.J. Zoccolan D. Rust N.C. How does the brain solve visual object recognition?.Neuron. 2012; 73: 415-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). At the earliest stages of visual processing in the retina, systems identification techniques, such as reverse correlation, have spurred progress for understanding of how visual inputs are pooled to give rise to the receptive fields (RFs) of visual neurons (Field et al., 2010Field G.D.

Similar approaches have provided key insights about the population RFs of LGN afferents that make monosynaptic connections to neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) (Jin et al., 2011Jin J. Wang Y.

Neurosci. 2011; 14: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the detailed spatial structure of RFs in the secondary visual cortex (V2) (Anzai et al., 2007Anzai A. Peng X.

Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 1094-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At later stages of processing along the ventral stream it has been much more difficult to constrain such mechanistic models of receptive field structure. However, there has been considerable progress toward understanding what information is encoded based on decoding population responses (Pasupathy and Connor, 2002Pasupathy A. Connor C.E. Population coding of shape in area V4.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1332-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, Rust and Dicarlo, 2010Rust N.C. Dicarlo J.J. Selectivity and tolerance (“invariance”) both increase as visual information propagates from cortical area V4 to IT.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 12978-12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Area V4 lies at a critical intermediate juncture in the transformations that occur between V1/V2 and the final stages of shape processing in the inferotemporal cortex (areas TEO and TE). Earlier studies in V4 found that many neurons were selective to extended contours that form curved shapes (Pasupathy and Connor, 2001Pasupathy A. Connor C.E. Shape representation in area V4: position-specific tuning for boundary conformation.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 2505-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, Pasupathy and Connor, 1999Pasupathy A. Connor C.E. Responses to contour features in macaque area V4.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 2490-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of RF organization in V4 remains crucial for understanding the more invariant forms of object recognition that then follow in inferotemporal cortex. In a recent study (Nandy et al., 2013Nandy A.S. Sharpee T.O. Reynolds J.H. Mitchell J.F. The fine structure of shape tuning in area V4.Neuron. 2013; 78: 1102-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we examined the fine spatial structure of V4 RFs using reverse correlation techniques to estimate the tuning for curvature. We found that V4 neurons exhibit a tradeoff between curvature selectivity and spatial invariance. Neurons tuned to curved shapes exhibited very limited spatial invariance, while those that preferred straight contours tended to show spatially invariant tuning. This diversity was explained by the fine-scale RF structure: fine-scale maps of orientation tuning across the RF for neurons preferring curved contours showed heterogeneous local variation, whereas tuning was homogeneous and thus translation invariant for neurons preferring straight contours. This previous analysis examined a temporally averaged static picture of the RF structure. Here we investigate whether the homogeneity/heterogeneity observed in the spatial domain extended to the temporal domain as well. We find that the fine-scale RFs in V4 often show previously unappreciated spatio-temporal structure. Some neurons have progressively shifting spatial kernels. Others show distinct temporal signatures in different RF sub-regions, while others have spatial kernels that dissipate over time from the center to the edges. As in the spatial domain, the complexity of these temporal patterns varied with the heterogeneity of the fine-scale receptive field map: neurons with spatially varying shape tuning have distinct temporal response patterns that unfold across RF locations. In contrast, neurons with spatially invariant shape tuning have similar temporal response patterns across RF locations. We find that computational models that use this temporal information to decode stimulus identity far outperform simpler models based on time-averaged spike counts. We suggest that this tradeoff between simple/complex shape selectivity and homogeneity/heterogeneity in both the spatial and temporal domains could potentially reflect a spatio-temporal shape code in area V4. We analyzed responses from 86 well-isolated neurons in area V4 of two awake, behaving male macaques (see Experimental Procedures). The stimuli consisted of oriented bars that served to map each neuron’s RF and orientation preference at a fine spatial scale, as well as composite contours that served to map the neuron’s shape preference at a coarser spatial scale (Figure 1). The temporal evolutions of the fine-scale RF structure of four example neurons are shown in Figure 2 (upper panels). Each panel depicts the fine-scale structure of the receptive field at different time points after stimulus onset (non-overlapping 8.33 ms time bins). Neuron I has two distinct spatial sub-regions (“sub-fields” with different orientation preferences, color-coded with different hues, upper panels) with very different temporal patterns. The red sub-field emerges earlier and persists longer as compared to the yellow sub-field, which emerges later and has a much shorter duration. Neuron II exhibits a clear and progressive spatial shift in the spatio-temporal RF (STRF) over time. These temporal patterns in the evolution of the RFs are not correlated to systematic drifts in fixational eye movements (Figures S1A and S1B). Example neuron III illustrates a third STRF pattern that we observe in our data: receptive fields that dissipate outward over time from a central region. Finally, neuron IV is an example in which the receptive field remains fixed in place over time.Figure 2Fine-Scale Spatio-Temporal Receptive FieldsShow full captionFor 4 example neurons.

To capture these spatial excursions, we tracked the center of mass of each RF as it unfolded over time. We generated response contours from the fine-scale STRFs (Figure 2, lower panels; see Experimental Procedures) and calculated contour centroids. By connecting successive centroids, we could generate spatial trajectories of the fine-scale STRFs. Figure 3A illustrates the spatial trajectory of the centroids over time (yellow) superimposed over the time-averaged spatial RFs for the four example neurons in Figure 2 (centroid trajectories shown only for the 80% response level). There are 20 trajectories in each panel, each corresponding to a jackknifed subset of the data. This pattern of stability holds for all response levels (Figure S1C) and for completely disjoint subsets of the data (Figure S1D; first 50% of trials compared to last 50% of trials). Thus, V4 neurons exhibit very stable, repeatable patterns in the temporal evolution of their RFs. We next quantified whether these temporal patterns were significantly different from the range of temporal patterns expected from stationary RFs. For each trajectory, we identified the pair of STRF time bins that contributed to a maximum spatial separation (Dmax) among the corresponding pair of centroids. To facilitate comparison across the population of neurons with varying RF sizes, we calculated a normalized measure of the maximum spatial excursion (Dnorm). This was done by dividing Dmax by the major axis of an elliptical fit (DRF) to the time-averaged spatial RF (Figure 3A; see Experimental Procedures). Trajectories with minimal spatial excursions will have Dnorm values close to 0, while those with excursions spanning the width of the RF will have values close to 1. This normalized measure, Dnorm, is plotted in rank order for every unit in our population in Figure 3B (example units in Figure 2 are highlighted with corresponding numerals). Several units have large spatial excursions compared to the size of the RF, some exceeding half the width of the RF. These findings were robust across time and not due to any non-stationarities in recordings, as reflected by similar results when we repeated the analysis using the first and second halves of the data (Figure S1E). To compute whether these spatial excursions were statistically significant, we compared Dnorm to those obtained from a null distribution. The null distribution, Dnorm−shuffled, assumed that the spatial RF remained stationary throughout the temporal response such that temporally shuffling response bins per location would have no appreciable effect on the computation of the centroid and thus our Dnorm measure. Because the average temporal response varies over time, often with a sharp transient to start, we first normalized responses per time bin before shuffling. A bootstrap procedure was then used to compute the null distribution (see Experimental Procedures). We reasoned that if the trajectories in the data were not due to any underlying temporal structure, then the statistics of the temporally shuffled data would not be significantly different from the statistics computed on the unshuffled data. The null distribution for each unit is also shown in Figure 3B (gray error bars). By this measure, 67 out of the 86 units were significantly different from chance (p<0.05; non-significant units marked with “x” in the figure). Thus, a majority of units (78%) had spatial patterns in the temporal evolution of their RFs that could not be attributed to chance. In an earlier study (Nandy et al., 2013Nandy A.S. Sharpee T.O. Reynolds J.H. Mitchell J.F. The fine structure of shape tuning in area V4.Neuron. 2013; 78: 1102-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we found that V4 neurons selective for curved composite shapes exhibited considerable spatial heterogeneity in their tuning. The above analysis reveals that the center of mass of V4 RFs undergoes considerable excursions in visual space as the RF unfolds over time and that these excursions cannot be attributed to chance. This raises the possibility that the shape tuning heterogeneity in the spatial domain that was reported in the earlier study might extend to the temporal domain as well. In particular, we wondered if neurons with spatial heterogeneity in their shape tuning might also exhibit heterogeneity in their temporal response profiles. We thus investigated the temporal response properties of our population to the composite shape stimuli. We examined the coarse-scale STRFs (obtained from the composite shape stimuli) and first observed that shape selectivity at a particular RF location remained stable over time (Figures 4A, 4B, and S2). To quantify this, we computed a dispersion metric of peak shape selectivity in shape space (see Experimental Procedures). Across the population, the dispersion metric is highly skewed toward low values (Figure 4C). We compared the dispersion metric for each unit to a null distribution obtained from temporally shuffled data. 82 out of 86 units had dispersion metrics that were not significantly different from null (p>0.05). Shape tuning across time was thus highly conserved for the population. However, the temporal response profiles were different in different parts of the RF for some neurons (example unit shown in Figure 4A). To investigate this further, we extracted the temporal response patterns (temporal kernel) to the composite stimuli at different locations within each neuron’s spatial RF (see Experimental Procedures). Temporal kernels are illustrated for two example neurons in Figures 5A and 5B . The first example neuron has spatially varying shape selectivity (Figure 5A, top row) and diverse temporal kernels in different parts of its RF (Figure 5B, top row). In contrast, the second example neuron has spatially homogeneous shape selectivity and very similar temporal kernels in different parts of the RF (Figures 5A and 5B, bottom row). To quantify the diversity of temporal kernels, we extracted four purely temporal aspects of each response kernel: the time point at which the response first reaches significance, tsig; the duration over which the response remained significant, ΔTsig; the time point at which the response reached its peak, tpeak; and the duration over which there was a sustained response at a level above the half-way mark between peak and baseline, ΔTmid (Figures 5B and S3A; see Experimental Procedures). Because several of these temporal measures are related (Figure S3B), we performed a principal components analysis (PCA) on this four dimensional space to reduce its dimensionality (Figure S3). The first principal component is dominated by ΔTsig, a measure of response duration, while the second gets roughly equal contributions from the other three parameters and is related to response latency (Figure S3D). These two components accounted for 88% of the variance (Figure S3E). Each kernel could then be represented as a point in the 2D plane defined by the first two principal components. The Euclidean distance between two such points gives a measure of similarity between the corresponding pair of temporal kernels (Figure S4, last column). To quantify the diversity of shape tuning, we calculated a measure of the similarity of shape tuning between pairs of spatial locations within the RF (pattern correlation; see Experimental Procedures). High pattern correlation values indicate spatially homogeneous tuning, while low values indicate spatially heterogeneous tuning (Figure S4, middle column). To investigate the relationship between spatial diversity of shape tuning and the spatial diversity of temporal kernels, we computed the average pairwise pattern correlation and temporal kernel distance for each neuron across all pairs of RF locations with significant response. Figure 5C shows the scatterplot of average temporal kernel distance versus average pattern correlation for all neurons in our population. Neurons with high pattern correlation show a relatively low temporal response distance. Neurons with low average pattern correlation exhibit a wide range of temporal kernel distances. Overall, we find that pattern correlation and temporal kernel distance are inversely correlated across the neural population (Spearman’s ρ=−0.28,p=0.01). Spatial and temporal heterogeneity are thus correlated with one another. Neurons with spatially invariant tuning tend to have similar temporal kernels across RF locations. Although neurons with spatially varying tuning exhibit a large scatter in their average temporal kernel distances, a large subset have diverse temporal kernels. This inverse relationship is even stronger if we restrict our analysis to the subset of units whose Dnorm values are in the top 50th percentile (top 43 units in Figure 3B; Figure S3F; Spearman’s ρ=−0.43,p=0.005). Temporal kernel distance is positively correlated with Dnorm (ρ=0.19,p=0.04), suggesting the involvement of the fine-scale STRF dynamics in shaping the temporal kernels; conversely, pattern correlation is negatively correlated with Dnorm (ρ=−0.16,p=0.03). Finally, we investigated the potential role of the observed temporal dynamics in neural coding. We took the neural response of all 86 units as a population code and asked whether a temporal code can outperform a mean-rate-based code. We trained classifiers (random forest classifiers, see Experimental Procedures) to perform a 72-way classification of the shape data (corresponding to the 72 composite shapes, Figure 1) in a position-invariant manner. Classifiers were trained on three categories of population codes (Figure 6A). The snapshot classifiers (Figure 6A, gray) were trained on data from individual time bins. The temporal pattern classifier was trained on the temporal patterns of responses across a subset of time bins (Figure 6A, blue). The rate classifier was trained on the sum total response across the same subset of time bins as the temporal pattern classifier (Figure 6A, orange). As expected, the snapshot classifiers (Figure 6B, gray symbols) exhibit chance performance at time bins less than 50 ms. Performance for these classifiers peaks at around 60ms, which corresponds to the expected latency of V4 neurons. The rate classifier (Figure 6B, orange symbol), which was trained on the total neuronal responses in the 8 time bins between 50 and 120 ms, performs only marginally better than peak snapshot performance at V4 latency. However, the temporal pattern classifier (Figure 6B, solid blue symbol) with access to the pattern of responses in these 8 time bins far outperforms the rate classifier with about a 3× improvement in performance. This shows that there is rich information contained in the temporal response patterns that a decoder can potentially exploit in decoding shape information. By shuffling the temporal response patterns (random shuffle for each sample provided to the classifier), we verified that the improved performance was not due to the larger number of features used by the temporal pattern classifier as compared to the rate classifier (Figure 6B, purple “x” symbol). We verified this improvement in performance using two other kinds of classifiers: decision tree and support vector machine (SVM). Absolute performance values for the decision tree classifiers are lower compared to the random forest, as expected, but the pattern of improvement remains the same (Figure S5A). Since SVM does not directly support multi-way classification, we used a standard method (one-versus-one, see Experimental Procedures) to adapt SVM for multi-way classification. As with the other classifiers, the SVM-based classifier shows a similar pattern of improvement, with the temporal pattern classification exhibiting improved performance over the rate and snapshot classifiers (Figure S5B). We next subdivided our population into three sub-populations based on their average temporal kernel distances: neurons whose distances lay in the lower third, middle third, and upper third percentiles (ranges indicated by vertical bars in Figure 5C). Performance improvement of the temporal patterns classifiers over the rate classifier increases with increasing diversity of temporal kernels in the sub-population (Figure 6C), further supporting the idea that temporal response patterns in V4 are information rich. We recorded from a small subset of neurons (n=6) where the stimuli were presented for longer duration (200 ms) in addition to the fast reverse correlation (16 ms) method. As in our previous study (Nandy et al., 2013Nandy A.S. Sharpee T.O. Reynolds J.H. Mitchell J.F. The fine structure of shape tuning in area V4.Neuron. 2013; 78: 1102-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) where we found virtually identical shape tuning for both slow and fast stimuli, here we find that the temporal response patterns within 120 ms of stimulus onset are essentially similar for both stimulus durations (Figure S6). To quantify this, we extracted the temporal kernel parameters (used in the PCA analysis above) from the responses to both the slow and fast stimuli. This was done for all spatially significant response locations among the subset of units (n = 36). The temporal kernel parameters for the two stimulus conditions are highly correlated: ρtsig=0.79,ρtpeak=0.93,ρΔTsig=0.69,ρΔTmid=0.65, all p≪0.01. The current findings show significant variation in the temporal response of V4 neurons across their receptive fields. We find that in addition to their diverse spatial selectivity (Nandy et al., 2013Nandy A.S. Sharpee T.O. Reynolds J.H. Mitchell J.F. The fine structure of shape tuning in area V4.Neuron. 2013; 78: 1102-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), neurons that are tuned to curved contours also exhibit diverse temporal response patterns and that a decoder with access to such response patterns can outperform a rate code decoder. This improvement is larger for neurons with greater diversity of temporal response patterns. This suggests that V4 neurons may employ the temporal domain to encode shape information. Although the importance of a temporal code in the shape processing pathway has been appreciated for a long time (McClurkin et al., 1991McClurkin J.W. Optican L.M. Richmond B.J. Gawne T.J. Concurrent processing and complexity of temporally encoded neuronal messages in visual perception.Science. 1991; 253: 675-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), our study provides the first quantification of this benefit in area V4, which is a critical locus in this pathway. Diverse temporal kernels could allow a neuron to multiplex information about multiple features. This finding also suggests a possible disambiguation of the V4 shape code. We previously found that V4 neurons tuned to curved shapes exhibit very limited spatial invariance (Nandy et al., 2013Nandy A.S. Sharpee T.O. Reynolds J.H. Mitchell J.F. The fine structure of shape tuning in area V4.Neuron. 2013; 78: 1102-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These neurons preferred different curved shapes in different parts of their RF. If such neurons employed a purely spatial code, then their output signal (input to a recipient area such as the posterior infero-temporal cortex) would necessarily be ambiguous, since the code will not contain any additional information about the particular curved shape that the neuron was responding to. Such ambiguity could be partially resolved if different sub-fields in the RF had different temporal kernels (Figure 5). The temporal response patterns would then contain information about the particular shape that the neuron was signaling. This proposal is purely hypothetical, though here we have demonstrated the existence of neurons in V4 with the requisite heterogeneity in space and time. It is important to note that our classification analysis is based on the full temporal pattern of the neuronal response and it therefore assumes a perfect memory or storage of the response patterns. Memory for these patterns may in fact be leakier than a mean rate code. To the extent that this holds, on the timescale of the classifier (120 ms), our model may overestimate the relative advantage of the temporal code. Further studies, both empirical and theoretical, are necessary to investigate whether these neurons serve to support this type of spatio-temporal code, what role they play in perception, and how such a code could be decoded in a recipient area such as the infero-temporal cortex. A related question is how these differential temporal patterns may emerge. Parafoveal V4, from which our neurons were recorded, receives inputs from both areas V1 and V2 (Ungerleider et al., 2008Ungerleider L.G. Galkin T.W. Desimone R. Gattass R. Cor"
https://openalex.org/W2510956061,"Artificial reefs are commonly used as a management tool, in part to provide ecosystem services, including opportunities for recreational fishing and diving. Quantifying the use of artificial reefs by recreational boaters is essential for determining their value as ecosystem services. In this study, four artificial–natural reef pairs in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (off western Florida) were investigated for boat visitation rates using autonomous acoustic recorders. Digital SpectroGram (DSG) recorders were used to collect sound files from April 2013 to March 2015. An automatic detection algorithm was used to identify boat noise in individual files using the harmonic peaks generated by boat engines, and by comparing the sound amplitude of each file with surrounding files. In all four pairs, visitation rates were significantly higher at the artificial reef than the natural reef. This increase in boat visitation was likely due to actual or perceived increased quality of fishing and diving at the artificial reefs, or to lack of knowledge of the presence or locations of the natural reefs. Inshore reefs (<15 m depth) had high variability in monthly visitation rates, which were generally highest in warmer months. However the seasonal signal was dampened on offshore reefs (>25 m depth). This study appears to be the first to use acoustic data to measure participant use of boating destinations, and highlights the utility of acoustic monitoring for the valuation of this important ecosystem service provided by artificial reefs."

PKA is composed of catalytic subunits and cAMP-binding regulatory subunits (5Reimann E.M. Brostrom C.O. Corbin J.D. King C.A. Krebs E.G.

In the absence of cAMP stimulation, PKA forms an inactive tetramer composed of four subunits with two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. Upon nutritional deprivation or hormonal stimulation, activated adenylyl cyclase produces cAMP from ATP. Then, the regulatory subunit of PKA binds cAMP, causing a conformational change that decreases its affinity for catalytic subunits by ∼104-fold and leads to the release of active catalytic subunits to phosphorylate target proteins (6Granot J.

To date, several hundred PKA target proteins have been identified, and yet new PKA substrates are continually being reported (8Shabb J.B.

In mammalian adipocytes, numerous studies over the last 40 years have revealed that the cAMP-PKA axis forms a critical node in the regulation of lipolysis. For instance, major components of lipolytic pathways, including hormone-sensitive lipase (Hsl) 2The abbreviations used are: Hsl, hormone-sensitive lipase; ATGL, adipose triglyceride lipase; qRT-PCR, quantitative real time-PCR; hADSC, human adipose-derived stem cell. and perilipin 1 (Plin1), are direct targets of PKA (10Duncan R.E.

Upon receiving activation signals from molecules such as catecholamine and glucagon, activated PKA phosphorylates Plin1 and HSL to promote the recruitment of HSL to lipid droplets (14Tansey J.T.

Thus, it is likely that most anabolic or catabolic signals affecting lipolysis are closely involved in the regulation of the cAMP-PKA axis. Suppression of lipolysis in the basal state is crucial as excessive lipolysis would be detrimental and cause lipotoxicity. During the basal state, the pseudo-substrate domain of PKA regulatory subunits binds to the active site of catalytic subunits to inhibit kinase activity (25Corbin J.D. Sugden P.H. West L. Flockhart D.A. Lincoln T.M. McCarthy D. Studies on the properties and mode of action of the purified regulatory subunit of bovine heart adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase.J. Biol.

Thus, regulatory subunits of PKA may contribute to maintain low levels of basal lipolysis by inhibiting the action of catalytic subunits. PKA has four regulatory subunit genes, RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ, and two catalytic subunit genes, Cα and Cβ, in rodents (three in humans) (28McKnight G.S. Cyclic AMP second messenger systems.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It has been reported that these subunits exhibit different tissue distributions and biochemical properties. To elucidate the role of these subunits, mouse models with genetically manipulated PKA subunits have been studied. In adipocytes, RIIβ is the predominant regulatory subunit isoform (29Cummings D.E. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Genetically lean mice result from targeted disruption of the RIIβ subunit of protein kinase A.Nature. 1996; 382: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). RIIβ knock-out mice are morphologically normal and fertile despite reduced adiposity (29Cummings D.E. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Genetically lean mice result from targeted disruption of the RIIβ subunit of protein kinase A.Nature. 1996; 382: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar); they are also protected from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (30Schreyer S.A. Cummings D.E. McKnight G.S. LeBoeuf R.C. Mutation of the RIIβ subunit of protein kinase A prevents diet-induced insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in mice.Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2555-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that the loss of RIIβ results in the up-regulation of RIα subunit, which leads to increased cAMP sensitivity and higher basal lipolysis in adipocytes (31Amieux P.S.

Despite the abovementioned studies, deciphering fine-tuned regulatory mechanisms of PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits is limited in mouse models probably due to the compensatory effects of multiple subunit isoforms. Therefore, another approach is needed to reveal the regulatory processes of each PKA subunit, which would be important in decoding energy homeostasis. The PKA pathway is evolutionarily well conserved; PKA of lower organisms is simpler than that of vertebrates. Because the Caenorhabditis elegans genome encodes a single PKA catalytic (kin-1) and regulatory (kin-2) subunit (33Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Lu X. Rubin C.S. Cloning, characterization, and expression of the gene for the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), compensation by other subunit isoforms is not possible. Thus, C. elegans would likely be a great genetic model organism to study the roles of regulatory and catalytic subunits of PKA. Previously, we reported that PKA signaling is activated upon fasting in worms and plays crucial roles in fasting-induced lipolysis with ATGL-1 (C05D11.7) (13Lee J.H. Kong J. Jang J.Y. Han J.S. Ji Y. Lee J. Kim J.B. Lipid droplet protein LID-1 mediates ATGL-1-dependent lipolysis during fasting in Caenorhabditis elegans.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34: 4165-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In fasted worms, ATGL-1 is phosphorylated and stabilized by PKA in intestinal cells. In addition, PKA augments the interaction between ATGL-1 and lipid droplet protein LID-1 (C25A1.12), leading to lipolysis in the intestinal cells of C. elegans. In this study, we investigated the effects of PKA subunit depletion on lipid metabolism. To define the roles of each PKA subunit and to minimize complex compensatory regulation observed in mouse models, we used C. elegans and mammalian adipocytes. First, we tested whether the balance between regulatory and catalytic subunits might influence PKA activity and lipolysis. Second, we explored which specific isoforms may be functionally important in mammalian adipocytes. In C. elegans, modulation of PKA activity by kin-1 or kin-2 RNA interference (RNAi) showed pleiotropic effects, including altered lipid metabolism. In mammalian adipocytes, combinatorial small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection revealed that among the four regulatory subunits of PKA, RIα and RIIβ were required for the inhibition of basal lipolysis. These data suggest that the balance between catalytic and regulatory PKA subunits is important for blocking unnecessary PKA activation and avoiding futile lipolysis in lipid-storing tissues, independent of cAMP signaling. To prevent unwanted PKA activation in the basal state, the kinase activity of catalytic subunits is efficiently controlled by regulatory subunits. Regulatory subunits of PKA have been proposed to be sensitive inhibitors of catalytic subunits in the absence of cAMP (5Reimann E.M. Brostrom C.O. Corbin J.D. King C.A. Krebs E.G. Separation of regulatory and catalytic subunits of the cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase(s) of rabbit skeletal muscle.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 42: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies using purified PKA subunits have revealed that the apparent dissociation constant would be 0.1–0.6 nm (35Hofmann F. Apparent constants for the interaction of regulatory and catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase I and II.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1559-1564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Builder S.E. Beavo J.A. Krebs E.G. The mechanism of activation of bovine skeletal muscle protein kinase by adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3514-3519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that the addition of a purified cAMP-binding component of PKA, the so-called regulatory subunits, to the protein kinase fraction of PKA inhibits its kinase activity in the absence of cAMP (37Brostrom C.O. Corbin J.D. King C.A. Krebs E.G. Interaction of the subunits of adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate-dependent protein kinase of muscle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1971; 68: 2444-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 38Kumon A. Yamamura H. Nishizuka Y. Mode of action of adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic phosphate on protein kinase from rat liver.Biochem.

Mechanism of activation by adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate of a protein phosphokinase from rabbit reticulocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1970; 67: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a decrease in the regulatory subunit would result in stimulation of PKA activity (Fig. 1A). Because the opening of the active site is critical for PKA catalytic subunits to phosphorylate target substrates, it is likely that the decrease of regulatory subunits, which bind to the active site cleft, would lead to increased kinase activity. Before thoroughly investigating how PKA activity is modulated by different ratios of regulatory and catalytic subunits in the absence of cAMP changes, we decided to analyze a simple inhibitor model of PKA to test whether our hypothesis is plausible. Assuming there is no change in cAMP concentration and the dissociation constant between catalytic and regulatory subunits is constant (0.1 nm), our analysis showed that the amounts of free and active catalytic subunits would steeply increase upon reduction of regulatory subunits (Fig. 1, B and C). However, this model has potential limitations to explain the action of tetrameric PKA action in living cells with varying cAMP concentrations. Thus, these calculations may give some clues for the hypothesis that the balance between catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA might be crucial to determine basal PKA activity independent of cAMP levels. Compared with other organisms, C. elegans has only one gene for the PKA catalytic and regulatory subunits (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). C. elegans KIN-1 and KIN-2 show high protein sequence homology with mammalian PKA catalytic (∼80%) and regulatory (∼60%) subunit proteins. Multiple alignment and phylogram analysis showed that the isoforms of vertebrate PKA subunits would be diverged from ancestral forms as suggested previously (40Søberg K. Jahnsen T. Rognes T. Skålhegg B.S. Laerdahl J.K. Evolutionary paths of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) catalytic subunits.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e60935Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that C. elegans PKA genes may have preserved ancestral forms of PKA and may be representative of many PKA genes among eukaryotes. In worms, we investigated tissue distribution of kin-1 and kin-2 using their own promoters with green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters. As shown in Fig. 1D, neither kin-1 nor kin-2 showed tissue specificity in C. elegans. Although kin-1 was highly expressed in body wall muscles, head muscles, and gonads, kin-2 was highly expressed in muscles and hypodermis. Expression of PKA genes in the intestine was relatively low compared with that in the muscles or gonad. To test the hypothesis that changes in PKA subunit balance may alter PKA activity in vivo, we introduced kin-1 or kin-2 RNAi in C. elegans. Feeding RNAi of kin-1 and kin-2 selectively reduced their respective mRNA levels (Fig. 1E). Next, we examined PKA activity with total protein extracts and the PKA-specific substrate Kemptide. As shown in Fig. 1F, kin-1 RNAi considerably decreased PKA activity both in the absence and presence of cAMP. In contrast, kin-2 RNAi greatly increased PKA activity in the absence of cAMP. However, in the presence of dibutyryl-cAMP, the PKA activity of kin-2 RNAi in worms was not different from that of controls. We also observed that addition of a PKA inhibitor drastically decreased PKA activity. Consistent with previous reports (33Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Lu X. Rubin C.S. Cloning, characterization, and expression of the gene for the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these data suggest that kin-1 and kin-2 are well conserved PKA subunit orthologs, and suppression of PKA subunits by feeding RNAi can effectively modulate PKA activity in C. elegans. In living organisms, PKA participates in diverse cellular processes, which also seems to be the case in C. elegans. For instance, kin-2 RNAi caused dumpy morphology with aberrant intestinal structures, whereas kin-1 RNAi resulted in relatively normal morphology (Fig. 2A). Compared with control worms, both kin-1 and kin-2 RNAi worms had shortened life spans (Fig. 2B) and greatly reduced locomotor activity (Fig. 2C and supplemental Movies S1–S3). However, pharyngeal pumping rates were not significantly different (Fig. 2D). In addition, the number of eggs laid was markedly reduced in both kin-1 and kin-2 RNAi worms (Fig. 2E), which is consistent with a previous report that PKA signaling is important in oocyte maturation (41Kim S. Govindan J.A. Tu Z.J. Greenstein D. SACY-1 DEAD-Box helicase links the somatic control of oocyte meiotic maturation to the sperm-to-oocyte switch and gamete maintenance in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 2012; 192: 905-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate changes in lipid metabolism upon suppression of each PKA subunit, we biochemically measured triglyceride contents from whole worm extracts. As shown in Fig. 2F, kin-1 RNAi increased triglyceride contents compared with controls. However, kin-2 RNAi did not exhibit significant differences. These results were unexpected because PKA stimulated lipolysis in the intestine of C. elegans upon fasting (13Lee J.H. Kong J. Jang J.Y. Han J.S. Ji Y. Lee J. Kim J.B. Lipid droplet protein LID-1 mediates ATGL-1-dependent lipolysis during fasting in Caenorhabditis elegans.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34: 4165-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated lipid-storing organelles using several lipophilic dyes. It has been reported that intestinal organelles in C. elegans are highly heterogeneous, and different organelles stain differently depending on the kind of dye and fixation process (42Elle I.C. Olsen L.C. Pultz D. Rødkaer S.V. Faergeman N.J.

C. elegans major fats are stored in vesicles distinct from lysosome-related organelles.Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 430-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). When worms were stained with Nile Red and fatty acid-conjugated BODIPY in the live state, suppression of kin-2 by RNAi decreased the fluorescence intensity in intestinal cells (Fig. 2G). However, hypodermal signals stained by BODIPY fatty acids were not decreased by kin-2 RNAi. This result suggests that PKA activation by kin-2 RNAi would decrease Nile Red- and BODIPY fatty acid-positive intestinal granules known as lysosome-related organelles. On the contrary, Oil Red O staining, which reportedly correlates well to biochemical triglyceride measurements (43O'Rourke E.J. Soukas A.A. Carr C.E. Ruvkun G. C. elegans major fats are stored in vesicles distinct from lysosome-related organelles.Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 430-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), showed increased lipid content in kin-1 RNAi worms (Fig. 2G). However, in the kin-2 RNAi group, distribution of Oil Red O-stained granules exhibited an irregular pattern. More careful examination revealed that in kin-2 RNAi worms, intestinal lipid droplets were depleted, and stained lipids were mostly accumulated in extra-intestinal tissues (Fig. 2H). In accordance with a previous report (13Lee J.H. Kong J. Jang J.Y. Han J.S. Ji Y. Lee J. Kim J.B. Lipid droplet protein LID-1 mediates ATGL-1-dependent lipolysis during fasting in Caenorhabditis elegans.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34: 4165-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), ATGL-1::GFP was found to be increased in the intestine upon kin-2 RNAi, which may explain the depletion of intestinal lipid storage (Fig. 2I). Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that the expression levels of the fasting-induced gene fil-1 and fatty acid oxidation gene cpt-3 were enhanced by kin-2 RNAi (Fig. 2J). However, atgl-1 mRNA levels were not changed by kin-1 or kin-2 RNAi. Taken together, these data suggest that PKA activity would selectively regulate intestinal lipid metabolism in C. elegans. Compared with nematodes, PKA systems are complex in mammals. In mice, there are two catalytic and four regulatory subunit genes. Tissue distribution of each PKA subunit in mice showed different patterns (Fig. 3A); catalytic subunit Cα was ubiquitously expressed, whereas Cβ was highly expressed in the brain. Moreover, the expression pattern of the regulatory subunit RIα was ubiquitous, whereas that of other regulatory isoforms showed more tissue-specific patterns. For instance, RIβ was abundant in the brain and low in other tissues, whereas RIIα was enriched in the muscles, and RIIβ was predominantly expressed in adipose tissues and the brain. During adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, expression levels of catalytic subunit Cα and regulatory subunit RIIβ were increased (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that specific subunits of PKA might play certain roles in adipocytes. Considering that PKA activity must be suppressed in the basal state, although its kinase activity is induced by hormonal stimulation, we hypothesized that the stoichiometry of regulatory and catalytic subunits of PKA is important to control basal PKA activity and, consequently, basal lipolytic activity in adipocytes. To test this, we transfected siRNAs that specifically targeted each PKA subunit into fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (supplemental Table S1). Knockdown efficiency and selectivity of each siRNA in various combinations were tested (supplemental Fig. S2). We also measured glycerol release into the culture media as an indicator of lipolysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, knockdown of each PKA subunit alone did not alter basal lipolysis as assessed by glycerol release. In addition, knockdown of both Cα and Cβ showed no difference, implying that basal PKA activity in adipocytes is maintained at a low level. Nevertheless, when siRNAs against all PKA regulatory subunit genes were cotransfected, the basal lipolysis rate markedly increased (Fig. 4A). These data imply that multiple isoforms of PKA regulatory subuni"

GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTP1 and GSTT1 genotypes were determined in 199 cRCC patients and 274 matched controls. Benzo(a)pyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)-DNA adducts were determined in DNA samples obtained from cRCC patients by ELISA method. Significant association between GST genotype and risk of cRCC development was found for the GSTM1-null and GSTP1-variant genotype (p = 0.02 and p<0.001, respectively). Furthermore, 22% of all recruited cRCC patients were carriers of combined GSTM1-null, GSTT1-active, GSTA1-low activity and GSTP1-variant genotype, exhibiting 9.32-fold elevated cRCC risk compared to the reference genotype combination (p = 0.04). Significant association between GST genotype and cRCC risk in smokers was found only for the GSTP1 genotype, while GSTM1-null/GSTP1-variant/GSTA1 low-activity genotype combination was present in 94% of smokers with cRCC, increasing the risk of cRCC up to 7.57 (p = 0.02). Furthermore, cRCC smokers with GSTM1-null genotype had significantly higher concentration of BPDE-DNA adducts in comparison with GSTM1-active cRCC smokers (p = 0.05). GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTA1 and GSTP1 polymorphisms might be associated with the risk of cRCC, with special emphasis on GSTM1-null and GSTP1-variant genotypes. Combined GSTM1-null, GSTT1-active, GSTA1 low activity and GSTP1-variant genotypes might be considered as “risk-carrying genotype combination” in cRCC."
https://openalex.org/W2481292273,"Dysfunction of homologous recombination is a common denominator of changes associated with breast cancer–predisposing mutations. In our previous work, we identified a functional signature in peripheral blood lymphocytes from women who were predisposed that indicated a shift from homologous recombination to alternative, error-prone DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways. To capture both hereditary and nonhereditary factors, we newly established a protocol for isolation and ex vivo analysis of epithelial cells, epithelialmesenchymal transition cells (EMTs), and fibroblasts from breast cancer specimens (147 patients). By applying a fluorescence-based test system, we analyzed the error-prone DSB repair pathway microhomology-mediated end joininginthese tumor-derivedcell types and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Inparallel, we investigated DNA lesion processing by quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy of histone H2AX phosphorylated on Ser139 focus after radiomimetic treatment. Our study reveals elevated histone H2AX phosphorylated on Ser139 damage removal in epithelial cells, not EMTs, and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase inhibitor sensitivities, which suggested a DSB repair pathway shift with increasing patient age. Of interest, we found elevated microhomology-mediated end joining in EMTs, not epithelial cells, from patients who received a treatment recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy, that is, those with high-risk tumors. Our discoveries of altered DSB repair activities in cells may serve as a method to further classify breast cancer to predict responsiveness to adjuvant chemotherapy and/or therapeutics that target DSB repair-dysfunctional tumors.—Deniz, M., Kaufmann, J., Stahl, A., Gundelach, T., Janni, W., Hoffmann, I., Keimling, M., Hampp, S., Ihle, M., Wiesmüller, L.

We probed the functional role of Fis1 Glu-78, whose elevated side chain pKa suggests participation in protein interactions. Fis1 binds partners Mdv1 or Dnm1 tightly, but mutation E78A weakens Fis1 interaction with Mdv1, alters mitochondrial morphology, and abolishes fission in a growth assay. In fis1Δ rescue experiments, Fis1-E78A causes a novel localization pattern in which Dnm1 uniformly coats the mitochondria. By contrast, Fis1-E78A at lower expression levels recruits Dnm1 into mitochondrial punctate structures but fails to support normal fission. Thus, Fis1 makes multiple interactions that support Dnm1 puncta formation and may be essential after this step, supporting a revised model for assembly of the mitochondrial fission machinery. The insights gained by mutating a residue with a perturbed pKa suggest that side chain pKa values inferred from routine NMR sample pH optimization could provide useful leads for functional investigations.

https://openalex.org/W2515189516,"Although only relatively few freshwater invertebrate families are reported from the Tibetan Plateau, the degree of endemism may be high. Many endemic lineages occur within permafrost areas, raising questions about the existence of isolated intra-plateau glacial refugia. Moreover, if such refugia existed, it might be instructive to learn whether they were associated with lakes or with more dynamic ecosystems such as ponds, wetlands, or springs. To study these hypotheses, we used pulmonate snails of the plateau-wide distributed genus Radix as model group and the Lake Donggi Cona drainage system, located in the north-eastern part of the plateau, as model site. First, we performed plateau-wide phylogenetic analyses using mtDNA data to assess the overall relationships of Radix populations inhabiting the Lake Donggi Cona system for revealing refugial lineages. We then conducted regional phylogeographical analyses applying a combination of mtDNA and nuclear AFLP markers to infer the local structure and demographic history of the most abundant endemic Radix clade for identifying location and type of (sub-)refugia within the drainage system. Our phylogenetic analysis showed a high diversity of Radix lineages in the Lake Donggi Cona system. Subsequent phylogeographical analyses of the most abundant endemic clade indicated a habitat-related clustering of genotypes and several Late Pleistocene spatial/demographic expansion events. The most parsimonious explanation for these patterns would be a scenario of an intra-plateau glacial refugium in the Lake Donggi Cona drainage system, which might have consisted of isolated sub-refugia. Though the underlying processes remain unknown, an initial separation of lake and watershed populations could have been triggered by lake-level fluctuations before and during the Last Glacial Maximum. This study inferred the first intra-plateau refugium for freshwater animals on the Tibetan Plateau. It thus sheds new light on the evolutionary history of its endemic taxa and provides important insights into the complex refugial history of a high-altitude ecosystem."

A3 was found to produce a large amount of palmitoleic and oleic acids after incubation at low temperatures. Using polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), a novel Δ9- fatty acid desaturase gene was isolated, cloned, and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene was designated as PA3FAD9 and has an open reading frame of 1,185 bp which codes for 394 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 45 kDa. The activity of the gene product was confirmed via GCMS, which showed a functional putative Δ9-fatty acid desaturase capable of increasing the total amount of cellular unsaturated fatty acids of the E. coli cells expressing the gene. The results demonstrate that the cellular palmitoleic acids have increased two-fold upon expression at 15°C using only 0.1 mM IPTG. Therefore, PA3FAD9 from Pseudomonas sp.A3 codes for a Δ9-fatty acid desaturase-like protein which was actively expressed in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2498155081,"Based on coupled networks, taking node load, capacity and load redistribution between two networks into consideration, we propose functionally identical coupled networks, which consist of two networks connected by interlinks. Functionally identical coupled networks are derived from the power grid of the United States, which consists of many independent grids. Many power transmission lines are planned to interconnect those grids and, therefore, the study of the robustness of functionally identical coupled networks becomes important. In this paper, we find that functionally identical coupled networks are more robust than single networks under random attack. By studying the effect of the broadness and average degree of the degree distribution on the robustness of the network, we find that a broader degree distribution and a higher average degree increase the robustness of functionally identical coupled networks under random failure. And SF-SF (two coupled scale-free networks) is more robust than ER-ER (two coupled random networks) or SF-ER (coupled random network and scale-free network). This research is useful to construct robust functionally identical coupled networks such as two cooperative power grids."
https://openalex.org/W2509315165,"The GTPase Rab1b is involved in ER to Golgi transport, with multiple Rab1b effectors (located at ERES, VTCs and the Golgi complex) being required for its function. In this study, we performed live-cell dual-expression studies to analyze the dynamics of Rab1b and some effectors located at the ERES-Golgi interface. Rab1b occupied widely distributed mobile punctate and tubular structures, displaying a transient overlaps with its effectors and showing that these overlaps occurred at the same time in spatially distinct steps of ER to Golgi transport. In addition, we assessed Rab1b dynamics during cargo sorting by analyzing the concentration at ERES of a Golgi protein (SialT2-CFP) during Brefeldin A washout (BFA WO). Rab1b was associated to most of the ERES structures, but at different times during BFA WO, and recurrently SialT2-CFP was sorted in the ERES-Rab1b positive structures. Furthermore, we reveal for first time that Rab1b localization time at ERES depended on GBF1, a Rab1b effector that acts as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Arf1, and that Rab1b membrane association/dissociation dynamics at ERES was dependent on the GBF1 membrane association and activity, which strongly suggests that GBF1 activity modulates Rab1b membrane cycling dynamic."
https://openalex.org/W2498654017,"Intragenic ERG deletions occur in 3-5% of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, specifically in B-other subtype lacking the classifying genetic lesions. They represent the only genetic lesion described so far present in the majority of cases clustering into a subgroup of B-other subtype characterized by a unique gene expression profile, probably sharing a common, however, not yet fully described, biological background. We aimed to elucidate whether ERG deletions could drive the specific biology of this ERG-related leukemia subgroup through expression of aberrant or decreased expression of wild type ERG isoforms. We showed that leukemic cells with endogenous ERG deletion express an aberrant transcript translated into two proteins in transfected cell lines and that one of these proteins colocalizes with wild type ERG. However, we did not confirm expression of the proteins in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases with endogenous ERG deletion. ERG deletions resulted in significantly lower expression of wild type ERG transcripts compared to B-other cases without ERG deletion. However, cases with subclonal ERG deletion, clustering to the same ERG deletion associated subgroup, presented similar levels of wild type ERG as cases without ERG deletion. In conclusion, our data suggest that neither the expression of aberrant proteins from internally deleted allele nor the reduced expression of wild type ERG seem to provide a plausible explanation of the specific biology of ERG -related leukemia subgroup."

https://openalex.org/W2490768324,"Depression is a highly heterogeneous disorder presumably caused by a combination of several factors ultimately causing the pathological condition. The genetic liability model of depression is likely to be of polygenic heterogeneity. miRNAs can regulate multiple genes simultaneously and therefore are candidates that align with this model. The habenula has been linked to depression in both clinical and animal studies, shifting interest towards this region as a neural substrate in depression. The goal of the present study was to search for alterations in miRNA expression levels in the medial and lateral habenula of rats exposed to the learned helplessness (LH) rat model of depression. Ten miRNAs showed significant alterations associating with their response to the LH paradigm. Of these, six and four miRNAs were significantly regulated in the MHb and LHb, respectively. In the MHb we identified miR-490, miR-291a-3p, MiR-467a, miR-216a, miR-18b, and miR-302a. In the LHb miR-543, miR-367, miR-467c, and miR-760-5p were significantly regulated. A target gene analysis showed that several of the target genes are involved in MAPK signaling, neutrophin signaling, and ErbB signaling, indicating that neurotransmission is affected in the habenula as a consequence of exposure to the LH paradigm."
https://openalex.org/W2485782978,"Awns, important domestication and agronomic traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.), are conferred by polygenes and the environment. Near isogenic line (NIL) pairs BM33 and BM38 were constructed from crosses between awnless japonica cv Nipponbare as recurrent parent, and lines SLG or Funingxiaohongmang (awned japonica accessions), respectively, as donors. In order to study the genetic and molecular mechanism of awning, two unknown, independent genes with additive effects were identified in a cross between the NILs. To map and clone the two genes, a BC4F4 population of 8,103 individuals and a BC4F6 population of 11,206 individuals were constructed. Awn3-1 was fine mapped to a 101.13 kb genomic region between Indel marker In316 and SNP marker S9-1 on chromosome 3. Nine predicted genes in the interval were annotated in the Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB), and Os03g0418600 was identified as the most likely candidate for Awn3-1 through sequence comparisons and RT-PCR assays. Awn4-2 was fine mapped to a 62.4 kb genomic region flanked by simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker M1126 and Indel maker In73 on chromosome 4L. This region contained the previously reported gene An-1 that regulates awn development. Thus, An-1 may be the candidate gene of Awn4-2. These results will facilitate cloning of the awn genes and thereby provide an understanding of the molecular basis of awn development."

https://openalex.org/W2516161178,"Severe to profound mixed hearing loss is associated with hearing rehabilitation difficulties. Recently, promising results for speech understanding were obtained with a direct acoustic cochlear implant (DACI). The surgical implantation of a DACI with standard coupling through a stapedotomy can however be regarded as challenging. Therefore, in this experimental study, the feasibility of direct acoustic stimulation was investigated at an anatomically and surgically more accessible inner ear site. DACI stimulation of the intact, blue-lined and opened lateral semicircular canal (LC) was investigated and compared with standard oval window (OW) coupling. Additionally, stapes footplate fixation was induced. Round window (RW) velocity, as a measure of the performance of the device and its coupling efficiency, was determined in fresh-frozen human cadaver heads. Using single point laser Doppler vibrometry, RW velocity could reliably be measured in low and middle frequency range, and equivalent sound pressure level (LE) output was calculated. Results for the different conditions obtained in five heads were analyzed in subsequent frequency ranges. Comparing the difference in RW membrane velocity showed higher LE in the LC opened condition [mean: 103 equivalent dB SPL], than in LC intact or blue-lined conditions [63 and 74 equivalent dB SPL, respectively]. No difference was observed between the LC opened and the standard OW condition. Inducing stapes fixation, however, led to a difference in the low frequency range of LE compared to LC opened. In conclusion, this feasibility study showed promising results for direct acoustic stimulation at this specific anatomically and surgically more accessible inner ear site. Future studies are needed to address the impact of LC stimulation on cochlear micromechanics and on the vestibular system like dizziness and risks of hearing loss."
