https://openalex.org/W2793943052,"To assess the potential of individual bile acids (IBA) and their profiles as mechanistic biomarkers of liver injury for humans in real world situations, we interrogated samples collected under minimum controlled conditions (ie subjects were not fasted). Total bile acids (TBA) have been considered to be biomarkers of liver injury for decades, and more recently, monitoring of IBA has been proposed for differentiation of variety of etiologies of liver injury. We established a LC-MS/MS methodology to analyze nine IBA, generated reference ranges, and examined effects of age, gender, and ethnicity for each IBA. Furthermore, we evaluated the ability of IBA and their profiles to detect hepatic injury in subjects with a broad range of liver impairments. To date, our study utilized the largest total cohort of samples (N = 645) that were divided into 2 groups, healthy or liver impaired, to evaluate IBA as biomarkers. The TBA serum levels in the Asian ethnic group trended higher when compared to other ethnic groups, and the serum concentrations of IBA, such as glycocholic acid (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and taurochenoxycholic acid (TCDCA) were significantly increased. To our knowledge, this report is the first to describe ethnic differences in serum concentrations of IBAs. In patients with hepatic impairments, with the exception of deoxycholic acid (DCA), the concentrations of IBAs were significantly elevated when compared with healthy subjects. The conjugated bile acids displayed greater differences between healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic impairments than non-conjugated bile acids. Furthermore, the subjects with hepatic impairments exhibited distinct profiles (signatures) of IBAs that clustered subjects according the nature of their liver impairments. Although additional studies are needed, our data suggested that the analysis of IBA has the potential to become useful for differentiation of various forms of liver injury."

Here, in order to identify biomarker candidates in plasma of GBM patients, we performed quantitative comparisons of the plasma proteomes of GBM patients (n = 14) and healthy controls (n = 15) using SWATH mass spectrometry analysis. The results were validated by means of quantitative targeted absolute proteomics analysis. As a result, we identified eight biomarker candidates for GBM (leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein (LRG1), complement component C9 (C9), C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (SERPINA3), apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB), gelsolin (GSN), Ig alpha-1 chain C region (IGHA1), and apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4)). Among them, LRG1, C9, CRP, GSN, IGHA1, and APOA4 gave values of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of greater than 0.80. To investigate the relationships between the biomarker candidates and GBM biology, we examined correlations between plasma concentrations of biomarker candidates and clinical presentation (tumor size, progression-free survival time, or overall survival time) in GBM patients. The plasma concentrations of LRG1, CRP, and C9 showed significant positive correlations with tumor size (R2 = 0.534, 0.495, and 0.452, respectively)."
https://openalex.org/W2789680212,"The oral anti-diabetic drug metformin has been found to reduce cardiovascular complications independent of glycemic control in diabetic patients. However, its role in diabetic retinal microvascular complications is not clear. This study is to investigate the effects of metformin on retinal vascular endothelium and its possible mechanisms, regarding two major pathogenic features of diabetic retinopathy: angiogenesis and inflammation. In human retinal vascular endothelial cell culture, metformin inhibited various steps of angiogenesis including endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in a dose-dependent manner. Its anti-angiogenic activity was confirmed in vivo that metformin significantly reduced spontaneous intraretinal neovascularization in a very-low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mutant mouse (p<0.05). Several inflammatory molecules upregulated by tumor necrosis factor-α in human retinal vascular endothelial cells were markedly reduced by metformin, including nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NFκB p65), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Further, metformin significantly decreased retinal leukocyte adhesion (p<0.05) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase was found to play a partial role in the suppression of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 by metformin, but not in those of NFκB p65 and IL-8. Our findings support the notion that metformin has considerable anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects on retinal vasculature. Metformin could be potentially used for the purpose of treating diabetic retinopathy in addition to blood glucose control in diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2792411327,"Background/Purpose Acral melanoma is the most common type of melanoma in Asians, and usually results in a poor prognosis due to late diagnosis. We applied a convolutional neural network to dermoscopy images of acral melanoma and benign nevi on the hands and feet and evaluated its usefulness for the early diagnosis of these conditions. Methods A total of 724 dermoscopy images comprising acral melanoma (350 images from 81 patients) and benign nevi (374 images from 194 patients), and confirmed by histopathological examination, were analyzed in this study. To perform the 2-fold cross validation, we split them into two mutually exclusive subsets: half of the total image dataset was selected for training and the rest for testing, and we calculated the accuracy of diagnosis comparing it with the dermatologist’s and non-expert’s evaluation. Results The accuracy (percentage of true positive and true negative from all images) of the convolutional neural network was 83.51% and 80.23%, which was higher than the non-expert’s evaluation (67.84%, 62.71%) and close to that of the expert (81.08%, 81.64%). Moreover, the convolutional neural network showed area-under-the-curve values like 0.8, 0.84 and Youden’s index like 0.6795, 0.6073, which were similar score with the expert. Conclusion Although further data analysis is necessary to improve their accuracy, convolutional neural networks would be helpful to detect acral melanoma from dermoscopy images of the hands and feet."
https://openalex.org/W2793441737,"The ability to non-invasively monitor tumor-infiltrating T cells in vivo could provide a powerful tool to visualize and quantify tumor immune infiltrates. For non-invasive evaluations in vivo, an anti-CD3 mAb was modified with desferrioxamine (DFO) and radiolabeled with zirconium-89 (Zr-89 or 89Zr). Radiolabeled 89Zr-DFO-anti-CD3 was tested for T cell detection using positron emission tomography (PET) in both healthy mice and mice bearing syngeneic bladder cancer BBN975. In vivo PET/CT and ex vivo biodistribution demonstrated preferential accumulation and visualization of tracer in the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. In tumor bearing mice, 89Zr-DFO-anti-CD3 demonstrated an 11.5-fold increase in tumor-to-blood signal compared to isotype control. Immunological profiling demonstrated no significant change to total T cell count, but observed CD4+ T cell depletion and CD8+ T cell expansion to the central and effector memory. This was very encouraging since a high CD8+ to CD4+ T cell ratio has already been associated with better patient prognosis. Ultimately, this anti-CD3 mAb allowed for in vivo imaging of homeostatic T cell distribution, and more specifically tumor-infiltrating T cells. Future applications of this radiolabeled mAb against CD3 could include prediction and monitoring of patient response to immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2789704095,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to both have powerful immunosuppressive properties and promote allograft tolerance. Determining the environmental oxygen tension and inflammatory conditions under which MSCs are optimally primed for this immunosuppressive function is essential to their utilization in promoting graft tolerance. Of particular interest is the mechanisms governing the interaction between MSCs and regulatory T cells (Tregs), which is relatively unknown. We performed our experiments utilizing rat bone marrow derived MSCs. We observed that priming MSCs in hypoxia promotes maintenance of stem-like characteristics, with greater expression of typical MSC cell-surface markers, increased proliferation, and maintenance of differentiation potential. Addition of autologous MSCs to CD4+/allogeneic endothelial cell (EC) co-culture increases regulatory T cell (Treg) proliferation, which is further enhanced when MSCs are primed in hypoxia. Furthermore, MSC-mediated Treg expansion does not require direct cell-cell contact. The expression of indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase, a mediator of MSC immunomodulation, increases when MSCs are primed in hypoxia, and inhibition of IDO significantly decreases the expansion of Tregs. Priming with inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and TNFα increases also expression of markers associated with MSC immunomodulatory function, but decreases MSC proliferation. The expression of IDO also increases when MSCs are primed with inflammatory cytokines. However, there is no increase in Treg expansion when MSCs are primed with IFNγ, suggesting an alternate mechanism for inflammatory-stimulated MSC immunomodulation. Overall, these results suggest that MSCs primed in hypoxia or inflammatory conditions are optimally primed for immunosuppressive function. These results provide a clearer picture of how to enhance MSC immunomodulation for clinical use."

Although not all OHCA are recoverable, the survival rate in Scotland is lower than in comparable countries, with higher average survival rates of 7.9% in England and 9% across Europe. The purpose of this paper is to explore the barriers, facilitators and public attitudes to administering bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) which could inform future policy and initiatives to improve the rate of bystander CPR. Data was collected via a cross-sectional general population survey of 1027 adults in Scotland. 52% of respondents had been trained in CPR. Of those who were not trained, two fifths (42%) expressed a willingness to receive CPR training. Fewer than half (49%) felt confident administering CPR, rising to 82% if they were talked through it by a call handler. Multivariate analyses identified that people in social grade C2DE were less likely than those in social grade ABC1 to be CPR trained and less confident to administer CPR if talked through by a call handler. The older a person was, the less likely they were to be CPR trained, show willingness to be CPR trained or be confident to administer bystander CPR with or without instruction from an emergency call handler. These findings are particularly relevant considering that most OHCA happen in the homes of older people. In a developed country such as Scotland with widely available CPR training, only half of the adult population reported feeling confident about administering bystander CPR. Further efforts tailored specifically for people who are older, unemployed and have a lower social grade are required to increase knowledge, confidence and uptake of training in bystander CPR."
https://openalex.org/W2793366919,"Depression drives cancer progression and induces poor clinical outcome. However, the mechanisms underlying depression and cancer outcomes are unclear. In this work, we investigated 98 prostate cancer patients and found that patients with high score of psychological depression were correlated with tumor invasion and metastasis. We found focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was increased in cancer patients with metastatic features and high score of depression. FAK knockdown completely blocked depression-promoted tumor invasion in orthotopic transplantation tumors. In Hi-myc mice and a murine model of depression, sympathetic activation was detected in the prostate tissue. Further we showed that FAK activation was dependent on a cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. Our results demonstrated that the activation of a sympathetic-FAK signaling pathway in prostate cancer patients with high degrees of depression facilitates tumor invasion. We suggest that blocking β2AR with propranolol or inhibiting FAK activation with PF562 271 may be novel strategies for depressed patients with invasive prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2789418401,"The essential histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) promotes both nucleosome assembly and disassembly. FACT is a heterodimer of Spt16 with either SSRP1 or Pob3, differing primarily by the presence of a high-mobility group B (HMGB) DNA-binding domain furnished only by SSRP1. Yeast FACT lacks the intrinsic HMGB domain found in SSRP1-based homologs such as human FACT, but yeast FACT activity is supported by Nhp6, which is a freestanding, single HMGB-domain protein. The importance of histone binding by FACT domains has been established, but the roles of DNA-binding activity remain poorly understood. Here, we examined these roles by fusing single or multiple HMGB modules to Pob3 to mimic SSRP1 or to test the effects of extended DNA-binding capacity. Human FACT and a yeast mimic both required Nhp6 to support nucleosome reorganization in vitro, indicating that a single intrinsic DNA-binding HMGB module is insufficient for full FACT activity. Three fused HMGB modules supported activity without Nhp6 assistance, but this FACT variant did not efficiently release from nucleosomes and was toxic in vivo. Notably, intrinsic DNA-binding HMGB modules reduced the DNA accessibility and histone H2A–H2B dimer loss normally associated with nucleosome reorganization. We propose that DNA bending by HMGB domains promotes nucleosome destabilization and reorganization by exposing FACT’s histone-binding sites, but DNA bending also produces DNA curvature needed to accommodate nucleosome assembly. Intrinsic DNA-bending activity therefore favors nucleosome assembly by FACT over nucleosome reorganization, but excessive activity impairs FACT release, suggesting a quality control checkpoint during nucleosome assembly.

This broad range of roles makes it difficult to assign individual physiological functions of Nhp6 or other HMGB domain proteins; as a result, little is known about how they contribute to specific processes or what drives the preference for architectural features, such as inclusion of an intrinsic domain in SSRP1 but not in Pob3, the dual repeats of the motif in HMGB1, or the single motif observed in Nhp6. yFACT (Spt16–Pob3) does not stably bind to or reorganize nucleosomes in the absence of Nhp6 in vitro, indicating a requirement for a DNA-binding domain to initiate or stabilize this structural change in vitro (4Xin H.

Genetic analysis shows that Nhp6 has an important but not essential role in yFACT function in vivo, but it is not clear whether other DNA-binding factors partially complement the loss of Nhp6. Therefore, it is not known whether some DNA-binding activity is just helpful for FACT function or is essential. Broad conservation of FACT at the sequence level suggests that its activities are also conserved, and the architecture of hFACT implies that the role contributed by Nhp6 in yFACT activity is instead performed by the HMGB domain in SSRP1. However, hFACT alone does not form stable complexes with intact nucleosomes (3Tsunaka Y. Fujiwara Y. Oyama T. Hirose S. Morikawa K.

The role of a DNA-binding/-bending domain in FACT activity and the different architectures of FACT, in different organisms, that are responsible for this activity therefore remain puzzling. To begin to address questions regarding the functional architecture of DNA-binding domains in FACT activity, we fused HMGB domains to the Pob3 subunit of yeast FACT and investigated the activities of the fusion proteins in vitro and in vivo. This allowed us to probe the effects of providing the DNA-binding activity to FACT in different structural contexts. We also compared the effects of intrinsic and freestanding HMGB domains on FACT activity by adding Nhp6 to yFACT constructs with different numbers of domains fused to Pob3 and to hFACT with its single native domain. Our results show that yFACT and hFACT have comparable activities, but stable binding to and reorganization of nucleosomes requires more than a single intrinsic HMGB domain in both cases. Notably, intrinsic DNA-binding domains reduced the amount of H2A–H2B dimer loss and the level of accessibility of nucleosomal DNA to nucleases during reorganization. The results therefore support the expected importance of DNA binding and bending by HMGB-domain proteins in initiating reorganization of nucleosomes by FACT, but they also suggest a role for intrinsic domains in promoting the resolution of the reorganized state to assemble nucleosomes. We propose a model in which FACT can form weak complexes with nucleosomes without the assistance of DNA-binding activity; this form is in equilibrium with a stably bound, reorganized structure whose formation requires freestanding HMGB proteins. DNA-bending activity provided by intrinsic HMGB domains skews the equilibrium toward intact nucleosomes, explaining the lower accessibility of the DNA and decreased H2A–H2B dimer loss. This model proposes a role for the known DNA-bending activity of HMGB domains (22Bruhn S.L. Pil P.M. Essigmann J.M. Housman D.E. Lippard S.J.

SSRP1 and Pob3 are similar over their first ∼450 residues followed by 60–90 residues with a high proportion of acidic amino acids (Fig. 1). This inherently unstructured acidic region is the C terminus of Pob3 and contains one of the two binding sites for H2A–H2B dimers in FACT, with the other being a similar domain in Spt16 (3Tsunaka Y.

SSRP1 proteins also have this feature, but it is followed by an HMGB DNA-binding domain and then a serine-rich (30% Ser in human SSRP1) and highly charged (20% Asp or Glu and 26% Lys or Arg) C-terminal tail, which we are calling the SAB (serine-acidic-basic) domain here. We fused the NHP6A gene in-frame with the 3′-end of the POB3 ORF, retaining all residues of each protein and adding a 3–6-residue linker between them, depending on the construct (see “Experimental procedures” and Pob3–1N in Fig. 1). Human SSRP1 has 27 residues separating the end of the acidic domain from the HMGB motif, and the Pob3–Nhp6 fusions were designed to mimic the length of this linker. These fusions therefore resembled the architecture of SSRP1 but did not include the serine-rich/charged tail for in vitro studies. Previous results with human FACT and Spt16–Pob3 suggested that a single HMGB domain would be insufficient to promote stable nucleosome binding or reorganization in vitro (3Tsunaka Y. Fujiwara Y.

We therefore also developed a strategy for inserting multiple Nhp6 modules at the C terminus of Pob3 in a plasmid-based expression construct (see “Experimental procedures”). Plasmids containing intact Pob3 were somewhat toxic to Escherichia coli even without explicit bacterial expression signals; this toxicity increased with each Nhp6 module added (not shown). We were therefore unable to recover constructs with more than three Nhp6 modules fused to Pob3 (Pob3–3N (Fig. 1)). For purification of FACT variants, we co-expressed the POB3 gene or its fusion derivatives along with normal SPT16, both from inducible GAL1 promoters in yeast cells (Fig. 2A and Ref. 4Xin H.

A high-copy GAL1p-POB3 plasmid expressed enough Pob3 to complement a deletion of this essential gene even when the GAL1 promoter was repressed with glucose (Fig. 2B, top panel). In contrast, POB3–3N did not complement a deletion, and overexpression of POB3–3N blocked the growth of a strain with a normal POB3 gene (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). This fusion protein was therefore toxic to yeast cells but provided a source for purifying the Spt16–Pob3–3N (SP–3N) heterodimers (Fig. 2A).

Further, socioeconomic status showed a significant and negative association with underweight. The association of underweight with poor self-rated health (OR = 1.60; p < .001), cognition (β = -0.95; p < .001) and quality of life (β = -1.90; p < .001) were remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex, place of residence, marital status, years of schooling, wealth quintile, sleep problems, chronic diseases, low back pain and state/province.The results indicated significant socioeconomic differentials in underweight and its association with poor self-rated health, cognition and quality of life outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W2789697462,"Dysregulation of lipid metabolism is common in cancer cells, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) stimulate lipid biosynthesis through transcriptional activation of lipogenic enzymes. However, SREBPs' roles and potential interacting partners in cancer cells are not fully defined. Using a biochemical approach, we found here that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) physically interacts with the nuclear form of SREBP-1a (nBP1a), by binding to amino acids 43-56 in nBP1a. We also found that PKM2 activates SREBP target gene expression and lipid biosynthesis by stabilizing nBP1a proteins. Using a competitive peptide inhibitor to block the formation of the SREBP-1a/PKM2 complex, we observed that this blockade inhibited lipogenic gene expression. Of note, nBP1a phosphorylation at Thr-59 enhanced the binding to PKM2 and promoted cancer cell growth. Moreover, we show that PKM2 phosphorylates Thr-59 in vitro Lastly, in human patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, nBP1a phosphorylation at Thr-59 was negatively correlated with clinical outcomes. Together, our results reveal that nBP1a/PKM2 interaction activates lipid metabolism genes in cancer cells and that Thr-59 phosphorylation of SREBP-1a plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2793174932,"In recent decades, there have been substantial increases in crop production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as a result of higher yields, increased cropping intensity, expansion of irrigated cropping systems, and rainfed cropland expansion. Yet, to date much of the research focus of the impact of climate change on crop production in the coming decades has been on crop yield responses. In this study, we analyse the impact of climate change on the potential for increasing rainfed cropping intensity through sequential cropping and irrigation expansion in central Benin. Our approach combines hydrological modelling and scenario analysis involving two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), two water-use scenarios for the watershed based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), and environmental water requirements leading to sustained streamflow. Our analyses show that in Benin, warmer temperatures will severely limit crop production increases achieved through the expansion of sequential cropping. Depending on the climate change scenario, between 50% and 95% of cultivated areas that can currently support sequential cropping or will need to revert to single cropping. The results also show that the irrigation potential of the watershed will be at least halved by mid-century in all scenario combinations. Given the urgent need to increase crop production to meet the demands of a growing population in SSA, our study outlines challenges and the need for planned development that need to be overcome to improve food security in the coming decades."

This study examined the accuracy of Bluetooth sensing (10-second intervals) via the ActiGraph GT9X Link monitor to determine location in an office setting, using two simple, bespoke algorithms.For one work day (mean±SD 6.2±1.1 hours), 30 office workers (30% men, aged 38±11 years) simultaneously wore chest-mounted cameras (video recording) and Bluetooth-enabled monitors (initialised as receivers) on the wrist and thigh. Additional monitors (initialised as beacons) were placed in the entry, kitchen, photocopy room, corridors, and the wearer's office. Firstly, participant presence/absence at each location was predicted from the presence/absence of signals at that location (ignoring all other signals). Secondly, using the information gathered at multiple locations simultaneously, a simple heuristic model was used to predict at which location the participant was present. The Bluetooth-determined location for each algorithm was tested against the camera in terms of F-scores.When considering locations individually, the accuracy obtained was excellent in the office (F-score = 0.98 and 0.97 for thigh and wrist positions) but poor in other locations (F-score = 0.04 to 0.36), stemming primarily from a high false positive rate. The multi-location algorithm exhibited high accuracy for the office location (F-score = 0.97 for both wear positions). It also improved the F-scores obtained in the remaining locations, but not always to levels indicating good accuracy (e.g., F-score for photocopy room ≈0.1 in both wear positions).The Bluetooth signalling function shows promise for determining where workers spend most of their time (i.e., their office). Placing beacons in multiple locations and using a rule-based decision model improved classification accuracy; however, for workplace locations visited infrequently or with considerable movement, accuracy was below desirable levels. Further development of algorithms is warranted."

However, the changes which occur in MCs during acupoint sensitization, i.e. the dynamic transformation of an acupoint from a ""silenced"" to an ""activated"" status, remain uncharacterized. To investigate the morphological and functional changes of MCs as an aid to understanding the cellular mechanism underlying acupoint sensitization, a rat model of knee osteoarthritis (OA) was induced by an injection of mono-iodoacetate (MIA) on day 0. On day 14, toluidine blue and immunofluorescence staining were used to observe the recruitment and degranulation of MCs and the release of mast cell co-expressed mediators: tryptase, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and histamine (HA) at the acupoints Yanglingquan (GB34), Heding (EX-LE2) and Weizhong (BL40). Results showed that the number of MCs as well as the percentages of degranulated and extensively degranulated MCs at the acupoints GB34 and EX-LE2 in the light (A), mild (B), heavy (C) osteoarthritis groups were larger than those in the normal control (N) and normal saline (NS) groups (p < 0.01). Comparisons among the A, B and C groups suggested that the number and the degranulation extent of the MCs at the acupoints GB34 and EX-LE2 were positively correlated with the severity of the disease. Some MCs in the A, B and C group showed the release of 5-HT, HA, and tryptase in degranulation at the acupoints GB34 and EX-LE2. Such changes in MCs were not observed at the acupoint BL40. In conclusion, this study confirmed that acupoint sensitization is associated with the increase in recruitment and degranulation levels of MCs on a acupoint-specific and disease severity-dependent manner. The release of tryptase, 5-HT, and HA during MC degranulation is likely to be one of the cellular mechanisms occurring during acupoint sensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2789946045,"Textual representations play an important role in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The efficiency of NLP tasks, such as text comprehension and information extraction, can be significantly improved with proper textual representations. As neural networks are gradually applied to learn the representation of words and phrases, fairly efficient models of learning short text representations have been developed, such as the continuous bag of words (CBOW) and skip-gram models, and they have been extensively employed in a variety of NLP tasks. Because of the complex structure generated by the longer text lengths, such as sentences, algorithms appropriate for learning short textual representations are not applicable for learning long textual representations. One method of learning long textual representations is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is suitable for processing sequences. However, the standard LSTM does not adequately address the primary sentence structure (subject, predicate and object), which is an important factor for producing appropriate sentence representations. To resolve this issue, this paper proposes the dependency-based LSTM model (D-LSTM). The D-LSTM divides a sentence representation into two parts: a basic component and a supporting component. The D-LSTM uses a pre-trained dependency parser to obtain the primary sentence information and generate supporting components, and it also uses a standard LSTM model to generate the basic sentence components. A weight factor that can adjust the ratio of the basic and supporting components in a sentence is introduced to generate the sentence representation. Compared with the representation learned by the standard LSTM, the sentence representation learned by the D-LSTM contains a greater amount of useful information. The experimental results show that the D-LSTM is superior to the standard LSTM for sentences involving compositional knowledge (SICK) data."
https://openalex.org/W2790006183,"Autophagy contributes to the treatment-resistance of many types of cancers, and chloroquine (CQ) inhibits autophagy. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) kills cancer cells but is minimally cytotoxic to normal cells. However, because the therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL is limited, it is necessary to augment TRAIL-induced anti-tumor effects. In this study, we explored the anti-tumor effects of a combination of CQ and TRAIL on two human pancreatic cancer cell lines: TRAIL-sensitive MiaPaCa-2 cells and Panc-1 cells that are less sensitive to TRAIL. Although both CQ and TRAIL reduced cancer cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, the combination acted synergistically. CQ increased the expression level of type-II LC3B without decreasing the expression of p62, an autophagic substrate, thus indicating inhibition of autophagy. CQ did not increase the levels of death receptors on cancer cells but reduced the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. A combination of CQ and TRAIL significantly increased cancer cell apoptosis. CQ induced cell-cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Also, CQ increased the p21 level but reduced that of cyclin B1. A combination of CQ and TRAIL reduced the colony-forming abilities of cancer cells to extents greater than either material alone. In xenograft models, combination CQ and TRAIL therapy significantly suppressed the growth of subcutaneously established MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells, compared with the untreated or monotherapy groups. Together, the results indicate that CQ in combination with TRAIL may be useful to treat human pancreatic cancer."

To clarify whether these differences have an impact on the etiology of the disease, we studied DD lesions from all year round grazing cattle of mixed breed in Brazil using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridization. The study included samples from 66 skin lesions and 5 healthy skins collected from five farms. Both techniques showed Treponema spp. to be the most abundant bacteria, present in all but one of the samples with minimal epidermal alterations. We identified eleven different Treponema strains belonging to the six major phylotypes of Treponema which have all previously been identified in DD lesions. Furthermore, we identify Dichelobacter nodosus in DD lesions by gene sequencing and also by fluorescent in situ hybridization in almost half of biopsy specimens in areas with mild epithelial damage and together with Treponema. The present data support the hypothesis that Treponema constitutes the main pathogen responsible for DD, independent of the environment and region where cows are kept, and it further suggests D. nodosus as another potentially important pathogen."

Nitroxide spin-label probes were introduced at individual GCAP1 residues: T29C, E57C, E133C, and E154C. The intermolecular distance of each spin-label probe (measured by DEER) defined restraints for calculating the GCAP1 dimeric structure by molecular docking. The DEER-derived structural model of the GCAP1 dimer was similar within the experimental error for both the Mg2+-bound activator and Ca2+-bound inhibitor states (RMSD < 2.0 Å). The GCAP1 dimer possesses intermolecular hydrophobic contacts involving the side chain atoms of H19, Y22, F73 and V77. The structural model of the dimer was validated by GCAP1 mutations (H19R, Y22D, F73E, and V77E) at the dimer interface that each abolished protein dimerization. Previous studies have shown that each of these mutants either diminished or completely suppressed the ability of GCAP1 to activate the cyclase. These results suggest that GCAP1 dimerization may affect compartmentalization of GCAP1 in the photoreceptors and/or affect regulation of the cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2794085009,"Motivation The literature on complex diseases is abundant but not always quantitative. This is particularly so for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), where many molecular pathways are qualitatively well described but this information cannot be used in traditional quantitative mathematical models employed in drug development. We propose the elaboration and validation of a logic network for IBD able to capture the information available in the literature that will facilitate the identification/validation of therapeutic targets. Results In this article, we propose a logic model for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) which consists of 43 nodes and 298 qualitative interactions. The model presented is able to describe the pathogenic mechanisms of the disorder and qualitatively describes the characteristic chronic inflammation. A perturbation analysis performed on the IBD network indicates that the model is robust. Also, as described in clinical trials, a simulation of anti-TNFα, anti-IL2 and Granulocyte and Monocyte Apheresis showed a decrease in the Metalloproteinases node (MMPs), which means a decrease in tissue damage. In contrast, as clinical trials have demonstrated, a simulation of anti-IL17 and anti-IFNγ or IL10 overexpression therapy did not show any major change in MMPs expression, as corresponds to a failed therapy. The model proved to be a promising in silico tool for the evaluation of potential therapeutic targets, the identification of new IBD biomarkers, the integration of IBD polymorphisms to anticipate responders and non-responders and can be reduced and transformed in quantitative model/s."
https://openalex.org/W2790503557,"Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is an enzyme and autoantigen expressed in thyroid and breast tissues. Thyroid TPO undergoes a complex maturation process however, nothing is known about post-translational modifications of breast-expressed TPO. In this study, we have investigated the biochemical properties of TPO expressed in normal and cancerous human breast tissues, and the maturation process and antigenicity of TPO present in a panel of human breast tissue-derived cell lines. We found that the molecular weight of breast TPO was slightly lower than that of thyroid TPO due to decreased glycosylation and as suggest results of Western blot also shorter amino acid chain. Breast TPO exhibit enzymatic activity and isoelectric point comparable to that of thyroid TPO. The biochemical properties of TPO expressed in mammary cell lines and normal thyrocytes are similar regarding glycan content, molecular weight and isoelectric point. However, no peroxidase activity and dimer formation was detected in any of these cell lines since the majority of TPO protein was localized in the cytoplasmic compartment, and the TPO expression at the cell surface was too low to detect its enzymatic activity. Lactoperoxidase, a protein highly homologous to TPO expressed also in breast tissues, does not influence the obtained data. TPO expressed in the cell lines was recognized by a broad panel of TPO-specific antibodies. Although some differences in biochemical properties between thyroid and breast TPO were observed, they do not seem to be critical for the overall three-dimensional structure. This conclusion is supported by the fact that TPO expressed in breast tissues and cell lines reacts well with conformation-sensitive antibodies. Taking into account a close resemblance between both proteins, especially high antigenicity, future studies should investigate the potential immunotherapies directed against breast-expressed TPO and its specific epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W2790313123,"The Mediator complex is at the core of transcriptional regulation and plays a central role in plant immunity. The MEDIATOR25 (MED25) subunit of Arabidopsis thaliana regulates jasmonate-dependent resistance to Botrytis cinerea through interacting with the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor of jasmonate signaling, MYC2. Another Mediator subunit, MED8, acts independently or together with MED25 in plant immunity. However, unlike MED25, the underlying action mechanisms of MED8 in regulating B. cinerea resistance are still unknown. Here, we demonstrated that MED8 regulated plant immunity to B. cinerea through interacting with another bHLH transcription factor, FAMA, which was previously shown to control the final proliferation/differentiation switch during stomatal development. Our research demonstrates that FAMA is also an essential component of B. cinerea resistance. The fama loss-of-function mutants (fama-1 and fama-2) increased susceptibility to B. cinerea infection and reduced defense-gene expression. On the contrary, transgenic lines constitutively overexpressing FAMA showed opposite B. cinerea responses compared with the fama loss-of-function mutants. FAMA-overexpressed plants displayed enhanced resistance to B. cinerea infection and increased expression levels of defensin genes following B. cinerea treatment. Genetic analysis of MED8 and FAMA suggested that FAMA-regulated pathogen resistance was dependent on MED8. In addition, MED8 and FAMA were both associated with the G-box region in the promoter of ORA59. Our findings indicate that the MED8 subunit of the A. thaliana Mediator regulates plant immunity to B. cinerea through interacting with the transcription factor FAMA, which was discovered to be a key component in B. cinerea resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2791255252,"Background In high income countries, cancer is one of the leading causes of death, with co-morbid depression contributing to the risk of increased mortality. However, both cancer and depression are neglected conditions in low income countries. The current study assessed the magnitude of depression and the association of pain complaints with depression among patients with cancer in a low income country. Method In this cross-sectional study participants were 390 patients with established diagnosis of cancer, who were recruited consecutively when visiting a tertiary treatment centre in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The occurrence of depression was determined using the nine items Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Major depressive disorder was confirmed: (1) when five or more of the PHQ-9 symptoms were endorsed as occurring for at least ‘more than seven days’, with the exception of suicidal ideation item which counted as a positive rating if it had occurred even once in the previous fifteen days. (2) one of the symptoms has to be either depressed mood or loss of interest. Pain complaint was measured by Numeral Rating Scale (NRS) and severity of pain was assessed using Verbal Rating Scale (VRS). Results The prevalence of major depressive disorder was 16.4% (95%CI: 13.1%, 20.4%), and subthreshold depression was 17.4% (95%CI: 14.0%, 21.5%). Pain complaints occurred in 69.0% (95%CI: 64.3%, 73.4%) of the participants. The odds of having a major depressive symptom was over four times higher among participants who had pain. Limitations The study was cross sectional and liable to recall bias. Recruitment was carried out in a tertiary referral hospital, which might lead to the selection of more economically well-off and educated participants limiting generalizability of the study. Moreover, we did not control for cancer types, which may be related to pain and the experience of depression. Some of the somatic symptoms in PHQ9 may also be related to the cancer itself. Conclusions This study highlights the clinical significance of both depression and pain complaints in patients with cancer in a low income country. Exploration of the impact of depressive disorders on quality of life and outcome of cancer is an important area for further research in low income countries."

ESC on the feet (32% of MS patients) and hands (30% of MS patients) were lower, and DN4 (77% of MS patients) and VPT (64% of MS patients) were greater than 2SD of the healthy control values, respectively. EDSS correlated with the number of relapses (r = 0.564, p < 0.001), VPT (r = -0.457, < 0.001) and ESC on the feet (r = -0.268, p = 0.023).Patients with multiple sclerosis have evidence of sudomotor dysfunction and elevated vibration perception, which were associated with neurological disability from MS."
https://openalex.org/W2789486601,"Unlike cisplatin, which forms bifunctional DNA adducts, monofunctional platinum(II) complexes bind only one strand of DNA and might target cancer without causing auditory side-effects associated with cisplatin treatment. We synthesized the monofunctional triamine-ligated platinum(II) complexes, Pt(diethylenetriamine)Cl, [Pt(dien)Cl]+, and Pt(N,N-diethyldiethylenetriamine)Cl, [Pt(Et2dien)Cl]+, and the monofunctional heterocyclic-ligated platinum(II) complexes, pyriplatin and phenanthriplatin, and compared their 5’-GMP binding rates, cellular compartmental distribution and cellular viability effects. A zebrafish inner ear model was used to determine if the monofunctional complexes and cisplatin caused hearing threshold shifts and reduced auditory hair cell density. The four monofunctional complexes had varied relative GMP binding rates, but similar cytosolic and nuclear compartmental uptake in three cancer cell lines (A549, Caco2, HTB16) and a control cell line (IMR90). Phenanthriplatin had the strongest effect against cellular viability, comparable to cisplatin, followed by [Pt(Et2dien)Cl]+, pyriplatin and [Pt(dien)Cl]+. Phenanthriplatin also produced the highest hearing threshold shifts followed by [Pt(dien)Cl]+, [Pt(Et2dien)Cl]+, cisplatin and pyriplatin. Hair cell counts taken from four regions of the zebrafish saccule showed that cisplatin significantly reduced hair cell density in three regions and phenanthriplatin in only one region, with the other complexes having no significant effect. Utricular hair cell density was not reduced by any of the compounds. Our results suggest that placing greater steric hindrance cis to one side of the platinum coordinating center in monofunctional complexes promotes efficient targeting of the nuclear compartment and guanosine residues, and may be responsible for reducing cancer cell viability. Also, the monofunctional compounds caused hearing threshold shifts with minimal effect on hair cell density, which suggests that they may affect different pathways than cisplatin."

There is a dearth of information understanding the mechanisms of protection induced by in ovo delivered CpG DNA. The objective of this study was to determine the immune cell changes post-hatch following in ovo delivery of the TLR21 ligand, CpG DNA. In order to quantify changes of percentage of KUL01+, IgM+ B, cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ and CD8α+ cells, trachea, lung, duodenum, large intestine, spleen and bursa of Fabricius were collected on day 1 post-hatch. We found increased recruitments of KUL01+ cells, in organs of these body systems post-hatch following in ovo delivery of CpG DNA. Although IgM+ B cells, CD4+ and CD8α+ cells were increased in lungs and immune system organs, these cells were not quantifiable from the trachea, duodenum and large intestine immediately following the hatch. Furthermore, when CpG DNA is delivered in ovo and subsequently infected with infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) post-hatch on day 1, CpG DNA reduces morbidity and mortality resulting from ILTV infection. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of host responses elicited following in ovo delivery of CpG DNA in avian species."

Included in these analyses were men who returned a 10-year follow-up questionnaire, which included questions about CAM use.Validated instruments assessed patient's HRQOL and psychological well-being. Poisson regression with robust variance estimation was used to estimate the adjusted relative risks of current CAM use for prostate cancer according to socio-demographic, clinical, HRQOL and psychological factors.996 of 1634 (61%) living PCOS participants completed the 10-year questionnaire. Of these 996 men, 168 (17%) were using CAMs for prostate cancer and 525 (53%) were using CAMs for any reason (including prostate cancer). Those using CAM for prostate cancer were more likely to be regular or occasional support group participants (vs. no participation RR = 2.02; 95%CI 1.41-2.88), born in another country (vs. Australian born RR = 1.59; 95%CI 1.17-2.16), have received androgen deprivation treatment (ADT) since diagnosis (RR = 1.60; 95%CI 1.12-2.28) or in the past two years (RR = 2.34; 95%CI 1.56-3.52). CAM use was associated with greater fear of recurrence (RR = 1.29; 95%CI 1.12-1.48), cancer-specific distress (RR = 1.15; 95%CI 1.01-1.30), cancer-specific hyperarousal (RR = 1.17; 95%CI 1.04-1.31), cancer locus of control (RR = 1.16; 95%CI 1.01-1.34) and less satisfaction with medical treatments (RR = 0.86; 95%CI 0.76-0.97), but not with intrusive thinking, cognitive avoidance, depression, anxiety or any HRQOL domains.In this study, about one in six long term prostate cancer survivors used CAMs for their prostate cancer with use centred around ADT, country of birth, distress, cancer control, fear of recurrence and active help seeking."
https://openalex.org/W2791470048,"Background and purpose Individuals with visual vertigo describe symptoms of dizziness, disorientation, and/or impaired balance in environments with conflicting visual and vestibular information or complex visual stimuli. Physical therapists often prescribe habituation exercises using optic flow to treat these symptoms, but there are no evidence-based guidelines for delivering optic flow and it is unclear how the brain processes such stimuli. The purposes of this study were to use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore cerebral activation during optic flow, and determine if visual fixation had a modulating effect on brain activity. Methods Fifteen healthy participants (7 males and 8 females; mean age 41 years old) stood in a virtual reality environment and viewed optic flow moving unidirectionally in the yaw plane with and without fixation. Changes in cerebral activation were recorded from the bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal and occipital lobes using fNIRS. Results Cerebral activation was greater with visual motion than while viewing a stationary scene. Greater cerebral activation in the bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal lobes was observed when optic flow was viewed with fixation. Discussion and conclusions Optic flow activates the bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal regions of the cerebral cortex. This activation is greater while viewing optic flow and a fixation target, providing preliminary evidence supporting the use of a fixation target during habituation exercises."
https://openalex.org/W2792844207,"Cystatin C is a cysteine protease inhibitor that is produced by nearly all human cells. The serum level of cystatin C is a stronger predictor of the renal outcome and the risk of cardiovascular events than the creatinine level. The resistive index (RI) on renal Doppler ultrasonography is a good indicator of vascular resistance as well as the renal outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, it is unclear whether serum cystatin C is associated with signs of vascular dysfunction, such as the renal RI. We measured the serum cystatin C levels in 101 CKD patients and investigated the relationships between cystatin C and markers of vascular dysfunction, including the renal RI, ankle-brachial pulse wave velocity (baPWV), intima-media thickness (IMT), and cardiac function. The renal RI was significantly correlated with the serum cystatin C level (p < 0.0001, r = 0.6920). The serum cystatin C level was found to be a significant determinant of the renal RI (p < 0.0001), but not the baPWV, in a multivariate regression analysis. The multivariate odds ratio of the serum cystatin C level for a renal RI of more than 0.66 was statistically significant (2.92, p = 0.0106). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve comparing the sensitivity and specificity of cystatin C for predicting an RI of more than 0.66 was 0.882 (cutoff value: 2.04 mg/L). In conclusion, the serum cystatin C level is an independent biomarker associated with the renal RI in patients with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2792233005,"Small therapeutic peptides represent a promising field for the treatment of pathologies such as cardiac diseases. However, the lack of proper target-selective carriers hampers their translation towards a potential clinical application. Aptamers are cell-specific carriers that bind with high affinity to their specific target. However, some limitations on their conjugation to small peptides and the functionality of the resulting aptamer-peptide chimera exist. Here, we generated a novel aptamer-peptide chimera through conjugation of the PDGFRβ-targeting Gint4.T aptamer to MP, a small mimetic peptide that via targeting of the Cavβ2 subunit of the L-type calcium channel (LTCC) can recover myocardial function in pathological heart conditions associated with defective LTCC function. The conjugation reaction was performed by click chemistry in the presence of N,N,N',N',N""-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine as a Cu (I) stabilizing agent in a DMSO-free aqueous buffer. When administered to cardiac cells, the Gint4.T-MP aptamer-peptide chimera was successfully internalized in cells, allowing the functional targeting of MP to LTCC. This approach represents the first example of the use of an internalizing aptamer for selective delivery of a small therapeutic peptide to cardiac cells."
https://openalex.org/W2793697381,"According to a broad range of research, opioids consumption can lead to pathological memory formation. Experimental observations suggested that hippocampal glutamatergic synapses play an indispensable role in forming such a pathological memory. It has been suggested that memory formation at the synaptic level is developed through LTP induction. Here, we attempt to computationally indicate how morphine induces pathological LTP at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. Then, based on simulations, we will suggest how one can prevent this type of pathological LTP. To this purpose, a detailed computational model is presented, which consists of one pyramidal neuron and one interneuron both from CA3, one CA1 pyramidal neuron, and one astrocyte. Based on experimental findings morphine affects the hippocampal neurons in three primary ways: 1) disinhibitory mechanism of interneurons in CA3, 2) enhancement of NMDARs current by μ Opioid Receptor (μOR) activation and 3) by attenuation of astrocytic glutamate reuptake ability. By utilizing these effects, simulations were implemented. Our results indicate that morphine can induce LTP by all aforementioned possible mechanisms. Based on our simulation results, attenuation of pathologic LTP achieved mainly by stimulation of astrocytic glutamate transporters, down-regulation of the astrocytic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlurs) or by applying NMDAR’s antagonist. Based on our observations, we suggest that astrocyte has a dominant role in forming addiction-related memories. This finding may help researchers in exploring drug actions for preventing relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2790862326,"Models of verbal working memory that incorporate active memory maintenance, long-term memory networks, and attention control have been developed. Current studies suggest that semantic representations of words, evoked via long-term memory networks, are actively maintained until they are needed to fulfill a role. In other words, it is possible that some mechanism actively refreshes semantic representations of words, analogous to but independently from articulatory rehearsal which refreshes phonological representations. One valuable piece of evidence is a double dissociation, observed in a dual task paradigm in which manual tapping disrupted a semantic memory task while articulatory suppression disrupted a phonological memory task. However, in that study, the secondary tasks could have competed not only with the maintenance but also with the encoding activities. Additionally, the study items in the phonological memory tasks were words; hence, the discriminability of the memory tasks is doubtful. The present study, therefore, examined a potential double dissociation in situations where the secondary tasks could not compete with encoding, using a modified phonological memory task. Furthermore, this article discusses a potential mechanism for maintaining semantic representations."
https://openalex.org/W2790888097,"Like 41 other calanoid copepods, Acartia tonsa, are capable of inducing embryonic quiescence when experiencing unfavorable environmental conditions. The ecdysone-signaling cascade is known to have a key function in developmental processes like embryogenesis and molting of arthropods, including copepods. We examined the role of ecdysteroid-phosphate phosphatase (EPPase), ecdysone receptor (EcR), ß fushi tarazu transcription factor 1 (ßFTZ-F1), and the ecdysteroid-regulated early gene E74 (E74), which represent different levels of the ecdysone-signaling cascade in our calanoid model organism. Progression of embryogenesis was monitored and hatching success determined to evaluate viability. Embryos that were induced quiescence before the gastrulation stage would stay in gastrulation during the rest of quiescence and exhibited a slower pace of hatching as compared to subitaneous embryos. In contrast, embryos developed further than gastrulation would stay in gastrulation or later stages during quiescence and showed a rapid pace in hatching after quiescence termination. Expression patterns suggested two peaks of the biological active ecdysteroids, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). The first peak of 20E was expressed in concert with the beginning of embryogenesis originating from yolk-conjugated ecdysteroids, based on EPPase expression. The second peak is suggested to originate from de novo synthesized 20E around the limb bud stage. During quiescence, the expression patterns of EPPase, EcR, ßFTZ-F1, and E74 were either decreasing or not changing over time. This suggests that the ecdysone-signaling pathway play a key role in the subitaneous development of A. tonsa embryogenesis, but not during quiescence. The observation is of profound ecological and practical relevance for the dynamics of egg banks."

Recombinant HSA is an alternative approach to plasma-derived HSA, providing increased safety and an unlimited supply. However, the safety of the residual host cell proteins (HCPs) co-purified with Oryza sativa HSA (OsrHSA) remains to be determined. An animal system was used to assess the immunogenicity of OsrHSA and its residual HCPs. Low immunogenicity and immunotoxicity of the residual HCPs at a dose of 25 μg/kg, equivalent to 25 times the clinical dosage of HSA, were observed. An anti-drug-antibody (ADA) analysis revealed that anti-HSA, anti-OsrHSA or anti-HCP antibodies developed with a low frequency in pHSA and OsrHSA treatments, but the titers were as low as 1.0–2.0. Furthermore, the titer and the incidence of the specific antibodies were not significantly different between the pHSA and OsrHSA groups, indicating that OsrHSA presents similar immunogenicity to that of pHSA. More importantly, no cytokines were stimulated after the administration of OsrHSA and the residual HCPs, suggesting that there was no risk of a cytokine storm. These results demonstrated that the residual HCPs from OsrHSA have low immunogenicity, indicating that the rice endosperm is one of the best hosts for plant molecular pharming."
https://openalex.org/W2791890006,"During adult interactions, behavioral mimicry, the implicit copying of an interaction partner's postures and mannerisms, communicates liking and affiliation. While this social behavior likely develops during early childhood, it is unclear which factors contribute to its emergence. Here, the roles of inhibitory control and social understanding on 5-year-olds' behavioral mimicry were investigated. Following a social manipulation in which one experimenter shared a sticker with the child and the other experimenter kept two stickers for herself, children watched a video in which these experimenters each told a story. During this story session, children in the experimental group (n = 28) observed the experimenters perform face and hand rubbing behaviors whereas the control group (n = 23) did not see these behaviors. Children's inhibitory control was assessed using the day-night task and their social understanding was measured through a parental questionnaire. Surprisingly, group-level analyses revealed that the experimental group performed the behaviors significantly less than the control group (i.e. a negative mimicry effect) for both the sticker-sharer and sticker-keeper. Yet, the hypothesized effects of inhibitory control and social understanding were found. Inhibitory control predicted children's selective mimicry of the sticker-keeper versus sticker-sharer and children's overall mimicry was correlated with social understanding. These results provide the first indications to suggest that factors of social and cognitive development dynamically influence the emergence and specificity of behavioral mimicry during early childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2791250782,"Benthic fauna play a crucial role in organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling at the sediment-water boundary in aquatic ecosystems. In terrestrial systems, grazing herbivores have been shown to influence below-ground communities through alterations to plant distribution and composition, however whether similar cascading effects occur in aquatic systems is unknown. Here, we assess the relationship between benthic invertebrates and above-ground fish grazing across the ‘grazing halos’ of Heron Island lagoon, Australia. Grazing halos, which occur around patch reefs globally, are caused by removal of seagrass or benthic macroalgae by herbivorous fish that results in distinct bands of unvegetated sediments surrounding patch reefs. We found that benthic algal canopy height significantly increased with distance from patch reef, and that algal canopy height was positively correlated with the abundances of only one invertebrate taxon (Nematoda). Both sediment carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N) and mean sediment particle size (μm) demonstrated a positive correlation with Nematoda and Arthropoda (predominantly copepod) abundances, respectively. These positive correlations indicate that environmental conditions are a major contributor to benthic invertebrate community distribution, acting on benthic communities in conjunction with the cascading effects of above-ground algal grazing. These results suggest that benthic communities, and the ecosystem functions they perform in this system, may be less responsive to changes in above-ground herbivorous processes than those previously studied in terrestrial systems. Understanding how above-ground organisms, and processes, affect their benthic invertebrate counterparts can shed light on how changes in aquatic communities may affect ecosystem function in previously unknown ways."

Twenty-one participants aged 20-26 years (22.2 ± 1.76) performed a PVT in four experimental conditions: one in which their own full name was pronounced every 20 s in the stimuli epochs, one in which their full name was pronounced in inverted form, one in which beeps were played, and a control condition with no stimuli. Listening to personal names reduced attentional lapses during the PVT (i.e., the number of reaction times no less than 500 ms). The results are a first step in applying the name effect to technologies and devices aimed at maintaining arousal levels and preventing accidents during a monotonous task, such as driving."
https://openalex.org/W2793903456,"Soil CO2 emissions are regarded as one of the largest flows of the global carbon cycle and small changes in their magnitude can have a large effect on the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Thus, a better understanding of this attribute would enable the identification of promoters and the development of strategies to mitigate the risks of climate change. Therefore, our study aimed at using data mining techniques to predict the soil CO2 emission induced by crop management in sugarcane areas in Brazil. To do so, we used different variable selection methods (correlation, chi-square, wrapper) and classification (Decision tree, Bayesian models, neural networks, support vector machine, bagging with logistic regression), and finally we tested the efficiency of different approaches through the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The original dataset consisted of 19 variables (18 independent variables and one dependent (or response) variable). The association between cover crop and minimum tillage are effective strategies to promote the mitigation of soil CO2 emissions, in which the average CO2 emissions are 63 kg ha-1 day-1. The variables soil moisture, soil temperature (Ts), rainfall, pH, and organic carbon were most frequently selected for soil CO2 emission classification using different methods for attribute selection. According to the results of the ROC curve, the best approaches for soil CO2 emission classification were the following: (I)–the Multilayer Perceptron classifier with attribute selection through the wrapper method, that presented rate of false positive of 13,50%, true positive of 94,20% area under the curve (AUC) of 89,90% (II)–the Bagging classifier with logistic regression with attribute selection through the Chi-square method, that presented rate of false positive of 13,50%, true positive of 94,20% AUC of 89,90%. However, the (I) approach stands out in relation to (II) for its higher positive class accuracy (high CO2 emission) and lower computational cost."

Methods The expression of 332 miRNAs was measured in 131 (Training cohort) and 130 (Validation cohort) patients with CSCC in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. The miRNA expression signature was identified by Cox Proportion Hazard regression model to the Training data set, and subsequently validated in an independent Validation set. Kaplan-Meier curves and the receiver operating characteristic analyses of 5 years were used to access the overall survival of miRNA signature. MiRNA signature-gene target analysis was performed, followed by the construction of the regulatory network. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were used to explore the function of target genes of miRNA signature. Results A 2-miRNA expression signature of hsa-mir-642a and hsa-mir-378c associated with survivability was identified in CSCC. Both of them had a significant diagnostic and prognostic value of patients with CSCC. A total of 345 miRNA signature-target pairs were obtained in the miRNA signature-gene target regulatory network, in which 316 genes were targets of has-mir-378c and has-mir-642a. Functional analysis of target genes showed that MAPK signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway and endocytosis were the significantly enriched signal pathways that covered most genes. Conclusions The 2-miRNA signature adds to the prognostic value of CSCC. In-depth interrogation of the 2-miRNAs will provide important biological insights that finding and developing novel molecularly prediction to improve prognosis for CSCC patients."

This study aimed to investigate the acute impact of ionizing radiation on the contractility of bladder strips and identify the radiation-sensitivity of the mucosa vs the detrusor. Guinea-pig bladder strips (intact or mucosa-free) received ex vivo sham or 20Gy irradiation and were studied with in vitro myography, electrical field stimulation and Ca2+-fluorescence imaging. Frequency-dependent, neurogenic contractions in intact strips were reduced by irradiation across the force-frequency graph. The radiation-difference persisted in atropine (1μM); subsequent addition of PPADs (100μM) blocked the radiation effect at higher stimulation frequencies and decreased the force-frequency plot. Conversely, neurogenic contractions in mucosa-free strips were radiation-insensitive. Radiation did not affect agonist-evoked contractions (1μM carbachol, 5mM ATP) in intact or mucosa-free strips. Interestingly, agonist-evoked contractions were larger in irradiated mucosa-free strips vs irradiated intact strips suggesting that radiation may have unmasked an inhibitory mucosal element. Spontaneous activity was larger in control intact vs mucosa-free preparations; this difference was absent in irradiated strips. Spontaneous Ca2+-transients in smooth muscle cells within tissue preparations were reduced by radiation. Radiation affected neurogenic and agonist-evoked bladder contractions and also reduced Ca2+-signalling events in smooth muscle cells when the mucosal layer was present.

This necropsy study, conducted on 243 captive cheetahs from one institution, investigated the relationships between focal palatine erosions, gastritis, enterocolitis, glomerulosclerosis, chronic renal infarcts, renal cortical and medullary fibrosis, and renal medullary amyloidosis at death. Associations between the individual renal lesions and death due to chronic renal disease and comparisons of lesion prevalence between captive bred and wild born and between normal and king coated cheetahs were also assessed. All lesions were significantly positively correlated with age at death. Renal medullary fibrosis was the only lesion associated with the likelihood of death being due to chronic renal disease, and cheetahs with this lesion were younger, on average, than cheetahs with other renal lesions. Alimentary tract lesions were not associated with amyloidosis. All lesions, except for palatine erosions, were more common in wild born than in captive bred cheetahs; the former were older at death than the latter. Having a king coat had no clear effect on disease prevalence. These results suggest that age and renal medullary fibrosis are the primary factors influencing the pathogenesis of chronic renal disease in captive cheetahs. Apart from amyloidosis, these findings are analogous to those described in chronic renal disease in domestic cats, which is postulated to result primarily from repetitive hypoxic injury of renal tubules, mediated by age and stress. Cheetahs may be particularly susceptible to acute renal tubular injury due to their propensity for stress and their extended life span in captivity, as well as their adaptation for fecundity (rather than longevity) and adrenaline-mediated high speed prey chases. The presence of chronic renal disease in subadult cheetahs suggests that prevention, identification and mitigation of stress are critical to the successful prevention of chronic renal disease in captive cheetahs."
https://openalex.org/W2792003946,"In rodents, CHRNs are involved in bitter taste transduction of nicotine and ethanol. Currently, it is not clear if CHRNs are expressed in human taste cells and if they play a role in transducing the bitter taste of nicotine and ethanol or in the synthesis and release of neurohumoral peptides. Accordingly, we investigated the expression and functional role of CHRNs in HBO cells. Using molecular techniques, we demonstrate that a subset of HBO cells express CHRNs that also co-express TRPM5, T1R3 or T2R38. Exposing HBO cells to nicotine or ethanol acutely or to nicotine chronically induced a differential increase in the expression of CHRN mRNA and protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Acutely exposing HBO cells to a mixture containing nicotine plus ethanol induced a smaller increase in CHRN mRNAs relative to nicotine or ethanol treatment alone. A subset of HBO cells responded to nicotine, acetylcholine and ATP with a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. Nicotine effects on [Ca2+]i were mecamylamine sensitive. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein was detected in HBO cells using ELISA. Acute nicotine exposure decreased BDNF in HBO cells and increased BDNF release in the medium. CHRNs were also detected in HEK293 cells by RT-PCR. Unlike HBO cells, CHRNs were localized in most of HEK293 cells and majority of HEK293 cells responded to nicotine and ethanol stimulation with a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. BDNF levels in HEK293 cells were significantly higher than in HBO cells but the nicotine induced release of BDNF in the media was a fraction of the BDNF cellular content. We conclude that CHRNs are expressed in TRPM5 positive HBO cells. CHRN mRNA expression is modulated by exposure to nicotine and ethanol in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Nicotine induces the synthesis and release of BDNF in HBO cells."

Activation of Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) GTPases is essential for vesicle formation via recruitment of cargo adaptors and coat proteins necessary for Golgi trafficking. Arf activation is spatially and temporally regulated by distinct guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) at different Golgi compartments. The yeast Arf-GEF Sec7 is a conserved and essential activator of Arf1 at the trans-Golgi network. Sec7 contains a highly conserved regulatory region, the homology upstream of Sec7 (HUS) box, with an unknown mechanistic role. In this study we explore how the HUS box, which is N-terminal to the catalytic domain, acts together with C-terminal regulatory domains in the allosteric activation of Sec7. We report that mutation of the HUS box disrupts positive feedback and allosteric activation of Sec7 by the GTPase Ypt31, a yeast Rab11 homolog. Taken together, our results support a model in which the inter- and intramolecular interactions of the HUS box and the C terminus are necessary for the allosteric activation of Sec7.

Outside of the GEF domain, the most highly conserved motif in the Golgi Arf-GEFs is a region in the HUS domain referred to as the HUS box (Fig. 1B). This motif is found in both the Sec7/BIG and Gea/GBF families, but its physiological role is poorly understood. In an initial study, it was speculated to be necessary for folding and/or thermal stability in Sec7 (29Mansour S.J. Skaug J. Zhao X.H. Giordano J. Scherer S.W. Melançon P. p200 ARF-GEP1: a Golgi-localized guanine nucleotide exchange protein whose Sec7 domain is targeted by the drug brefeldin A.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A subsequent study determined that a single point mutation in the HUS box of Gea2 was sufficient to disturb anterograde traffic (30Park S.K. Hartnell L.M. Jackson C.L. Mutations in a highly conserved region of the Arf1p activator GEA2 block anterograde Golgi transport but not COPI recruitment to membranes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16 (15930122): 3786-379910.1091/mbc.E05-04-0289Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In GNOM, the plant homolog of Gea2, the same HUS-box mutation disrupted a heterotypic interaction with the DCB domain (31Anders N. Nielsen M. Keicher J. Stierhof Y.D. Furutani M. Tasaka M. Skriver K. Jürgens G. Membrane association of the Arabidopsis ARF exchange factor GNOM involves interaction of conserved domains.Plant Cell. 2008; 20 (18203920): 142-15110.1105/tpc.107.056515Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence in support of a model in which the HUS box, which is N-terminal to the GEF domain, is important for the allosteric activation of Sec7 that results from a protein–protein interaction between the C terminus of Sec7 and its regulatory Rab GTPase Ypt31. We find that the deleterious effects of a HUS-box mutation cannot be compensated for by increasing Sec7 expression, indicating the importance of proper regulation. We show that a HUS-box mutation perturbs a Sec7 positive-feedback interaction. Finally, we demonstrate that although the HUS box is not required for interaction between Sec7 and Ypt31, it is required for the ability of Ypt31 to stimulate Sec7 GEF activity. We previously reported that the HUS box is important for Sec7 function, because the N653A mutation was lethal in a sensitized arf1Δ strain in which the levels of Arf1/2 at the Golgi have been reduced to 10% of the WT levels (15Richardson B.C. Halaby S.L. Gustafson M.A. Fromme J.C. The Sec7 N-terminal regulatory domains facilitate membrane-proximal activation of the Arf1 GTPase.Elife. 2016; 5 (26765562)e12411 10.7554/eLife.12411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To perform a more detailed assessment of the role of the HUS box in Sec7 function, we generated additional HUS box mutant versions of Sec7 and introduced these into yeast cells as the sole copy of the SEC7 gene, using strains with either normal (ARF1 ARF2) or reduced (arf1Δ ARF2) levels of Arf1/2 (Fig. 2). Both the N653A and D655A mutations resulted in normal growth in otherwise WT cells but resulted in lethality in arf1Δ cells. The D655A/C656A double mutation was lethal in both WT ARF1 and arf1Δ backgrounds. These results indicate that the HUS box is important for Sec7 function and that the N653A and D655A single mutations represent alleles that are likely partially compromised for HUS box function. To address the possibility that mutation of the HUS box simply reduced overall Sec7 activity, we tested whether overexpression of a HUS box mutant could rescue the growth phenotype. We found that overexpression of the N653A Sec7 mutant using a multicopy plasmid did not rescue the growth phenotype observed in arf1Δ cells (Fig. 2, A and B). This result suggests that the HUS box serves an important regulatory role. We therefore focused our subsequent efforts on the N653A mutation to gain mechanistic insights into the function of the HUS box in regulating Sec7 activity. Homodimerization of the Golgi Arf-GEFs is regulated by the N-terminal DCB/HUS domain and the C-terminal HDS4 domain (18Grebe M. Gadea J. Steinmann T. Kientz M. Rahfeld J.U. Salchert K. Koncz C.

In GBF1, N-terminal dimerization was shown to be necessary for protein stability because two point mutations that disrupted dimerization also resulted in faster degradation yet did not affect activity or localization (34Bhatt J.M.

We therefore considered the possibility that the HUS box could be contributing to dimerization of Sec7 via the DCB/HUS domains. To test this possibility, we purified WT and HUS box mutant (N653A) versions of the Sec7ΔC (residues 203–1017, lacking the C-terminal HDS1–4 regulatory domains) construct for in vitro studies (Fig. 3, A and B). The N653A mutant construct appeared to be stably folded, as evidenced by the similar purification yields and behavior compared with its WT counterpart. We observed that introduction of the N653A mutation did not disrupt dimerization of the Sec7ΔC construct, as measured by multiangle light scattering (MALS) (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the HUS box does not appear to be required for dimerization of the Sec7 N-terminal domains. To test whether the HUS box plays any role in regulation of Sec7 Arf-GEF activity, we utilized an established assay (35Futai E. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R.

This GEF assay was performed using the physiological myristoylated Arf1 substrate in the presence of synthetic liposome membranes that mimic the composition of the yeast TGN (38Klemm R.W. Ejsing C.S.

We introduced the N653A mutation into different Sec7 truncation constructs (Fig. 3, A and B): Sec7f (residues 203–2009) provides the full essential function of Sec7 in vivo; Sec7ΔC+HDS1 (residues 203–1220) is relieved of most autoinhibition and is subject to positive feedback but cannot be allosterically activated by Rab binding; and Sec7ΔC (described above) is the most active in solution but has low activity on membranes and is completely cytoplasmic in vivo (14Richardson B.C.

We previously reported that the N653A mutation did not diminish the in vitro GEF activity of the Sec7ΔC construct on membranes at room temperature, but there appeared to be a slight although statistically insignificant increase in the activity of the mutant compared with the WT construct (15Richardson B.C. Halaby S.L. Gustafson M.A. Fromme J.C. The Sec7 N-terminal regulatory domains facilitate membrane-proximal activation of the Arf1 GTPase.Elife. 2016; 5 (26765562)e12411 10.7554/eLife.12411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We repeated these experiments at 30 °C and observed that the N653A mutation resulted in ∼2-fold higher activity of the Sec7ΔC construct (Fig. 4, A and B). Consistent with our previously published results (14Richardson B.C. McDonold C.M. Fromme J.C. The Sec7 Arf-GEF is recruited to the trans-Golgi network by positive feedback.Dev. Cell. 2012; 22 (22516198): 799-81010.1016/j.devcel.2012.02.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we observed the Sec7ΔC+HDS1 construct to be significantly more active than the Sec7ΔC construct (Fig. 4, A and B), because of the role of the HDS1 domain in recruitment of this construct to the membrane surface. Interestingly, the N653A mutation reduced the activity of the Sec7ΔC+HDS1 construct to a level similar to that of the Sec7ΔC construct (Fig. 4, A and B). This suggested to us that the HUS box may be required for the HDS1 domain to exert its positive-feedback regulatory role in membrane association of Sec7. To test this hypothesis, we performed a membrane-binding assay to determine whether the HUS box plays a role in recruitment of Sec7 to membranes by Arf1–GTP. As seen previously (14Richardson B.C. McDonold C.M. Fromme J.C. The Sec7 Arf-GEF is recruited to the trans-Golgi network by positive feedback.Dev. Cell. 2012; 22 (22516198): 799-81010.1016/j.devcel.2012.02.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), Sec7ΔC+HDS1 was recruited to membranes by activated Arf1–GTP (Fig. 4C). Importantly, we observed that this recruitment was completely abolished when the same assay was performed with the N653A mutant (Fig. 4C). This indicates that the HUS box is required for the HDS1-domain–dependent recruitment of Sec7 to membranes by Arf1. In light of this result, we were surprised to find that the N653A mutation did not prevent membrane recruitment of the longer Sec7f construct by Arf1–GTP (Fig. 4D), indicating that the HDS2–4 domains enable recruitment of Sec7 to the membrane surface even when the HUS box is compromised by mutation. Consistent with this finding, we previously found that the Arf1–GTP recruitment of the Sec7f construct to membranes was more robust than that of the Sec7ΔC+HDS1 construct (14Richardson B.C. McDonold C.M. Fromme J.C. The Sec7 Arf-GEF is recruited to the trans-Golgi network by positive feedback.Dev. Cell. 2012; 22 (22516198): 799-81010.1016/j.devcel.2012.02.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the HUS box in Sec7 recruitment to the Golgi membrane surface in vivo, we imaged GFP-tagged versions of several WT and mutant Sec7 constructs. As reported previously, the GFP–Sec7ΔC construct was completely cytoplasmic, whereas GFP–Sec7ΔC+HDS1 was localized to the TGN (punctate structures) and the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). Strikingly, the N653A mutation rendered the GFP–Sec7ΔC+HDS1 construct completely cytoplasmic (Fig. 5A and Fig. S1). This result is consistent with the in vitro membrane-binding assay results and indicates that mutation of the HUS box phenocopies loss of the HDS1 domain. When we imaged full-length GFP–Sec7 constructs present as the sole copy of Sec7 in cells, we found that mutation of the HUS box had no effect on localization to punctate structures (Fig. 5B). This result is also consistent with the in vitro membrane-binding assay results and indicates that the HDS2–4 domains enable recruitment of Sec7 to the Golgi even when the HUS box is compromised by mutation. The proper localization of the N653A and D655A GFP–Sec7 constructs likely explains why these mutants are viable in WT ARF1 ARF2 cells yet suggests these mutants are misregulated in a manner that becomes lethal in arf1Δ ARF2 cells. The consequences of HUS-box mutations described above were revealed when the levels of Arf1/2 were reduced or when the C-terminal HDS2–4 domains were removed. Sec7 activity is stimulated by binding to the active form of the Rab11 paralogs Ypt31/32 (16McDonold C.M. Fromme J.C. Four GTPases differentially regulate the Sec7 Arf-GEF to direct traffic at the trans-Golgi network.Dev.

This interaction requires the HDS2–3 domains and likely enables Sec7 to adopt a fully active conformation on the membrane surface (Fig. 6A). We therefore considered the possibility that the HUS box is important for the allosteric regulation of Sec7. To test whether the HUS box was important for the allosteric activation of Sec7 by Ypt31/32, we performed GEF assays in the presence of the membrane-anchored Rab protein Ypt31 activated by binding to GTP. Whereas our previous versions of this assay utilized a His-tag membrane anchor for Ypt31 (16McDonold C.M. Fromme J.C. Four GTPases differentially regulate the Sec7 Arf-GEF to direct traffic at the trans-Golgi network.Dev.

Previously, three major groups of ColE1-like plasmids conferring kanamycin-resistance (KanR) in various S. enterica serotypes from diagnostic samples of human or animals were reported. In this study, over 200 KanR S. enterica isolates from slaughter samples, collected in 2010 and 2011 as a part of the animal arm of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, were screened for the presence of ColE1-like plasmids. Twenty-three KanR ColE1-like plasmids were successfully isolated. Restriction fragment mapping revealed five major plasmid groups with subgroups, including two new groups, X (n = 3) and Y/Y2/Y3 (n = 4), in addition to the previously identified groups A (n = 7), B (n = 6), and C/C3 (n = 3). Nearly 75% of the plasmid-carrying isolates were from turkey and included all the isolates carrying X and Y plasmids. All group X plasmids were from serotype Hadar. Serotype Senftenberg carried all the group Y plasmids and one group B plasmid. All Typhimurium isolates (n = 4) carried group A plasmids, while Newport isolates (n = 3) each carried a different plasmid group (A, B, or C). The presence of the selection bias in the NARMS strain collection prevents interpretation of findings at the population level. However, this study demonstrated that KanR ColE1-like plasmids are widely distributed among different S. enterica serotypes in the NARMS isolates and may play a role in dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes."
https://openalex.org/W2792599792,"Background Transfusion guidelines advocate restrictive rather than liberal use of red blood cells (RBC) and are based mostly on randomized trials in intensive care and surgical departments. We aimed to study RBC transfusion practice in the medical patients' population. Methods The data in this study were collected from patients over the age of 18 years admitted to an Internal Medicine department between 2009 and 2014 who received at least one unit of packed red blood cells (RBC). In addition, data on demographics, patients' diagnoses, laboratory tests and number of transfused RBC units were extracted from the electronic health records. Results One thousand three hundred and twenty eight patients were included, having mean age of 75 ± 14 years. The median hemoglobin (Hb) trigger for RBC transfusion was 8.0 g/dl (IQR 7.3–8.7g/dl), and most patients received either one (43.4%) or two (33.4%) RBC units. There was no significant difference in Hb trigger between males and females (Hb 8.0 g/dl and 7.9 g/dl, respectively, p = 0.098), and a weak correlation with age (r = 0.108 p = 0.001). Patients with cardiovascular and lung diseases had a statistically significant higher Hb trigger compared to patients without those diagnoses, however the median difference between them was 0.5 g/dl or less. Conclusions These ""real world"" data we collected show a Hb trigger compliant with the upper limit of published guidelines and influenced by medical patients' common diagnoses. Prospective trials addressing patients hospitalized in internal medicine departments could further contribute to transfusion decision algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2794121919,"In response to revisions in global and national policy in 2011, six-month isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) became freely available as a preventive measure for people living with HIV in the uMgungundlovu District of KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. Given a difference in uptake and completion by sex, we sought to explore the reasons why Zulu women were more likely to accept and complete IPT compared to men in an effort to inform future implementation.Utilising a community-based participatory research approach and ethnographic methods, we undertook 17 individual and group interviews, and met regularly with grassroots community advisory teams in three Zulu communities located in uMgungundlovu District between March 2012-December 2016.Three categories described women's willingness to initiate IPT: women are caregivers, women are obedient, and appearance is important. The findings suggest that the success of IPT implementation amongst clinic-utilising women of uMgungundlovu is related to the cultural gender norms of uMakoti, isiZulu for ""the bride"" or ""the wife."" We invoke the cultural concept of inhlonipho, meaning ""to show respect,"" to discuss how the cultural values of uMakoti may conflict with biomedical expectations of adherence. Such conflict can result in misinterpretations by healthcare providers or patients, and lead some patients to fear the repercussions of asking questions or contemplating discontinuation with the provider, preferring instead to appear obedient. We propose a shift in emphasis from adherence-focussed strategies, characteristic of the current biomedical approach, to practices that promote patient agency in an effort to offer IPT more appropriately.Building on existing tools, namely the harm reduction model and the use of mini-ethnography, we provide guidance on how to support women to participate as agents in the decision to initiate or continue IPT, decisions which may also impact the health and choices of the family."
https://openalex.org/W2792551057,"Utilization of energy-rich carbon sources such as glucose is fundamental to the evolutionary success of bacteria. Glucose can be catabolized via glycolysis for feeding the intermediary metabolism. The methylglyoxal synthase MgsA produces methylglyoxal from the glycolytic intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Methylglyoxal is toxic, requiring stringent regulation of MgsA activity. In the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, an interaction with the phosphoprotein Crh controls MgsA activity. In the absence of preferred carbon sources, Crh is present in the nonphosphorylated state and binds to and thereby inhibits MgsA. To better understand the mechanism of regulation of MgsA, here we performed biochemical and structural analyses of B. subtilis MgsA and of its interaction with Crh. Our results indicated that MgsA forms a hexamer (i.e. a trimer of dimers) in the crystal structure, whereas it seems to exist in an equilibrium between a dimer and hexamer in solution. In the hexamer, two alternative dimers could be distinguished, but only one appeared to prevail in solution. Further analysis strongly suggested that the hexamer is the biologically active form. In vitro cross-linking studies revealed that Crh interacts with the N-terminal helices of MgsA and that the Crh–MgsA binding inactivates MgsA by distorting and thereby blocking its active site. In summary, our results indicate that dimeric and hexameric MgsA species exist in an equilibrium in solution, that the hexameric species is the active form, and that binding to Crh deforms and blocks the active site in MgsA.

The rapid and selective utilization of energy-rich carbon sources is essential for the evolutionary success of bacteria. For many bacteria, including the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis, glucose is the preferred source of carbon and energy (1Fujita Y.

Glucose can be catabolized via glycolysis and thus feed into the intermediary metabolism. The availability of glucose results in a variety of regulatory events to transport and metabolize this sugar efficiently as well as to prevent the simultaneous utilization of secondary carbon sources. In B. subtilis, several regulators are involved in these processes. The RNA-binding transcription antiterminator GlcT is required for the expression of the glucose-specific transporter of the phosphotransferase system (PTS) 5The abbreviations used are: PTSphosphotransferase systemSECsize-exclusion chromatographyMALSmultiangle light scatteringPDBProtein Data BankRMSDroot mean square deviationBS3bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberateLBlysogeny brothMRmolecular replacementI_scinterface scoreBicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine.

Galinier A. Drastic differences in Crh and HPr synthesis levels reflect their different impacts on catabolite repression in Bacillus subtilis.J.

To gain more insight into the function of this protein, we have searched for Crh interaction partners and found that it binds the methylglyoxal synthase MgsA (23Landmann J.J. Busse R.A. Latz J.H. Singh K.D. Stülke J. Görke B. Crh, the paralogue of the phosphocarrier protein HPr, controls the methylglyoxal bypass of glycolysis in Bacillus subtilis.Mol.

MgsA is a key protein of a bypass of glycolysis, the formation of methylglyoxal from dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Methylglyoxal has been shown to regulate cell elongation (24Shin S.M. Song S.H. Lee J.W. Kwak M.K. Kang S.O. Methylglyoxal synthase regulates cell elongation via alterations of cellular methylglyoxal and spermidine content in Bacillus subtilis.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2017; 91 (28807600): 14-2810.1016/j.biocel.2017.08.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and this bypass acts as an essential overflow mechanism if phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates accumulate in the cell. These phosphorylated intermediates are toxic for the cell (25Böck A. Neidhardt F.C. Properties of a mutant of Escherichia coli with a temperature-sensitive fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase.J. Bacteriol. 1966; 92 (16562137): 470-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kadner R.J. Murphy G.P. Stephens C.M. Two mechanisms for growth inhibition by elevated transport of sugar phosphates in Escherichia coli.J. Gen.

Booth N.A. Nichols W.W. Dunbar B. Booth I.R. From famine to feast: the role of methylglyoxal production in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27 (9489667): 553-56210.1046/j.1365-2958.1998.00700.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, the bacteria have a choice that is comparable with the one between Scylla and Charybdis. Therefore, the formation of methylglyoxal has to be tightly controlled, and the bacterium needs efficient mechanisms for its disposal. Indeed, three pathways for the degradation of methylglyoxal to lactate or acetol have been discovered in B. subtilis (28Chandrangsu P. Dusi R. Hamilton C.J. Helmann J.D. Methylglyoxal resistance in Bacillus subtilis: contributions of bacillithiol-dependent and independent pathways.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 91 (24330391): 706-71510.1111/mmi.12489Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The mgsA gene encoding the methylglyoxal synthase is part of a seven-gene operon in B. subtilis. In addition to MgsA, this operon encodes enzymes for bacillithiol production, which are required for the major pathway of methylglyoxal degradation, as well as essential enzymes for cell wall biosynthesis and protein biotinylation. This operon including the mgsA gene is constitutively expressed, but expression is increased by thiol depletion (29Gaballa A. Newton G.L. Antelmann H. Parsonage D. Upton H. Rawat M. Claiborne A. Fahey R.C. Helmann J.D. Biosynthesis and functions of bacillithiol, a major low-molecular weight thiol in Bacilli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, regulation of MgsA enzymatic activity seems to be the major mechanism to control the production of the toxic metabolite methylglyoxal. In both Escherichia coli and B. subtilis, this enzyme is inhibited by Pi, which is generated by the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to methylglyoxal (23Landmann J.J. Busse R.A. Latz J.H. Singh K.D. Stülke J. Görke B. Crh, the paralogue of the phosphocarrier protein HPr, controls the methylglyoxal bypass of glycolysis in Bacillus subtilis.Mol.

In addition, nonphosphorylated Crh inactivates MgsA by direct protein-protein interaction in B. subtilis (23Landmann J.J. Busse R.A. Latz J.H. Singh K.D. Stülke J. Görke B. Crh, the paralogue of the phosphocarrier protein HPr, controls the methylglyoxal bypass of glycolysis in Bacillus subtilis.Mol.

This form of Crh is present if B. subtilis grows with poor carbon sources (23Landmann J.J. Busse R.A. Latz J.H. Singh K.D. Stülke J. Görke B. Crh, the paralogue of the phosphocarrier protein HPr, controls the methylglyoxal bypass of glycolysis in Bacillus subtilis.Mol.

It is interesting to note that MgsA interacts specifically with nonphosphorylated Crh, but not with the phosphorylated form of the protein. Moreover, HPr, which exhibits 45% identity with Crh, is also unable to bind MgsA. In a previous study, we have shown that the N-terminal α-helix of Crh is essential for the interaction of the two proteins. Moreover, replacement of the four differing amino acids in HPr in this helix with those found in Crh allowed efficient binding of HPr to MgsA (23Landmann J.J. Busse R.A. Latz J.H. Singh K.D. Stülke J. Görke B. Crh, the paralogue of the phosphocarrier protein HPr, controls the methylglyoxal bypass of glycolysis in Bacillus subtilis.Mol.

In this work, we have studied the molecular details of MgsA multimerization and the interaction between Crh and MgsA. Our findings suggest that MgsA is active only as a hexamer and, upon binding of Crh, the active site is deformed and thus blocked. Crh binding might result in decreased flexibility of the active center assemblies of MgsA hexamers and, thus, in loss of MgsA activity. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which Crh controls MgsA activity, we performed a size-exclusion chromatography and multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis of recombinantly expressed and freshly purified proteins. The results using MgsA identified exclusively dimers when a low concentration of MgsA (13 μm) was used (see Fig. 1A). This concentration is still about 10-fold increased compared with the cellular concentration (about 1 μm as calculated from Ref. 33Maass S. Wachlin G. Bernhardt J. Eymann C. Fromion V. Riedel K.

This is in contrast to the known oligomeric states of MgsA from other organisms showing a multimer exhibiting predominantly a tetrameric state in solution (32Hopper D.J. Cooper R.A.

To mimic the conditions in the crystallization experiments, the concentration was increased by a factor of about 10 (135 versus 13 μm), resulting in MgsA eluting as a dimer, and a broader peak width was observed for MgsA when the protein was injected at a higher concentration, indicating a higher-number oligomerization state (Fig. 1B). These results, using MgsA alone, strongly suggest an equilibrium of dimers (corresponding to 38 kDa as determined by MALS) and multimers (by calculation using the MALS data a tetramer, which would correspond roughly to the calculated 62 kDa). Interpretation of the MALS data and the shape of the elution profile from the gel-filtration experiments argue in favor of a highly dynamic assembly and disassembly of MgsA between a stable dimeric and an instable hexameric state, resulting in an average multimeric state of about 4. This would best explain the observed differences between the in-solution and in crystallo MgsA oligomerization states. Moreover, our experiments with MgsA revealed that the stability of the hexameric complex strongly depends on the surrounding medium, as, for example, phosphate or glycerol strongly increases the percentage of MgsA in a hexameric state (Fig. S2; also see “Discussion”). The purified regulator of MgsA, Crh, elutes in two peaks corresponding to the dimer and monomer form in a varying ratio, as has been already observed earlier (40Penin F. Favier A. Montserret R. Brutscher B. Deutscher J. Marion D. Galinier D. Evidence for a dimerisation state of the Bacillus subtilis catabolite repression HPr-like protein, Crh.J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3 (11361074): 429-432PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, peaks corresponding to a calculated mass of 20 and 10 kDa, respectively). In the presence of a 3-fold excess of Crh over MgsA, the formation of larger complexes was observed for MgsA at higher concentration (Fig. 1B). The elution volume of this corresponds to a mass of 143 kDa, which can be best explained by a hexamer of MgsA (105 kDa) bound to six Crh molecules (9.6 kDa each). This calculation is supported by the SDS-PAGE analysis of the respective fractions, which show the presence of equal amounts of both proteins (see Fig. 1, inset). Interestingly, at low concentration, only a slight shift of the first peak was observed in the elution volume (Fig. 1A), which, together with mass determined by MALS, could be interpreted as either a weak interaction between MgsA and Crh or even as a MgsA dimer and as a lack of interaction with Crh. The results from the SDS-PAGE support this conclusion (Fig. 1A, inset). To obtain structural information on B. subtilis MgsA, purified MgsA was crystallized, and X-ray diffraction data were collected. The crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2.34 Å, and the phase problem was solved by means of molecular replacement using the methylglyoxal synthase from Thermus sp.

The superposition reveals that the central cores of all enzymes are highly similar, with the structures of the methylgyloxal synthases from E. coli and Thermotoga maritima bearing an additional domain formed by N- and C-terminal regions visible in the crystal structures (Fig. S3). The second-best match are the large subunits of carbamoyl phosphate synthetases (Z-score of 14 to 10) with a root mean square deviation of 2.3–2.9 Å over 108–114 residues in the C-terminal region. The most prominent difference from the large subunit of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase from E. coli is a major structural rearrangement in the region of the transition from strand β3 to helix α3.

In such a case, a high incidence of recurrent pulmonary embolism is expected among patients who were discharged without APE workup.To determine the incidence of symptomatic APE among patients hospitalized for a first episode of syncope and discharged without APE workup or anticoagulation.This retrospective cohort study included patients hospitalized at Rambam Health Care Campus between January 2006 and February 2017 with a primary admission diagnosis of syncope, who were not investigated for APE and were not taking anticoagulants. The patients were followed up for up to three years after discharge. The occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during the follow-up period was documented.The median follow-up duration was 33 months. 1,126 subjects completed a three-year follow-up. During this period, 38 patients (3.38%) developed VTE, 17 (1.51%) of them had APE. The cumulative incidence of VTE and APE was 1.9% (95% CI 1.3%-2.5%) and 0.9% (95% CI 0.4%-1.3%) respectively. Only seven subjects developed APE during the first year of follow-up. The median times from the event of syncope to the development of APE and VTE were 18 and 19 months respectively.The cumulative incidence of VTE during a three-year follow-up period after an episode of syncope is low. In the absence of clinical suspicion, a routine diagnostic workup for APE in patients with syncope cannot be recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2789269116,"DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) block the progress of the replication and transcription machineries and can weaken chromosomal stability, resulting in various diseases. FANCD2-FANCI-associated nuclease (FAN1) is a conserved structure-specific nuclease that unhooks DNA ICLs independently of the Fanconi anemia pathway. Recent structural studies have proposed two different mechanistic features for ICL unhooking by human FAN1: a specific basic pocket that recognizes the terminal phosphate of a 1-nucleotide (nt) 5' flap or FAN1 dimerization. Herein, we show that despite lacking these features, Pseudomonas aeruginosa FAN1 (PaFAN1) cleaves substrates at ∼3-nt intervals and resolves ICLs. Crystal structures of PaFAN1 bound to various DNA substrates revealed that its conserved basic Arg/Lys patch comprising Arg-228 and Lys-260 recognizes phosphate groups near the 5' terminus of a DNA substrate with a 1-nt flap or a nick. Substitution of Lys-260 did not affect PaFAN1's initial endonuclease activity but significantly decreased its subsequent exonuclease activity and ICL unhooking. The Arg/Lys patch also interacted with phosphates at a 3-nt gap, and this interaction could drive movement of the scissile phosphates into the PaFAN1-active site. In human FAN1, the ICL-resolving activity was not affected by individual disruption of the Arg/Lys patch or basic pocket. However, simultaneous substitution of both FAN1 regions significantly reduced its ICL-resolving activity, suggesting that these two basic regions play a complementary role in ICL repair. On the basis of these findings, we propose a conserved role for two basic regions in FAN1 to guide ICL unhooking and to maintain genomic stability."

The performance of the AdaBoost-based vehicle detection system is dependent on its training data. Thus, its performance decreases when the shape of a target differs from its training data, or the pattern of a preceding vehicle is not visible in the image due to the light conditions. A stacked Difference of Gaussian (DoG)-based feature extraction algorithm is proposed to address this issue by recognizing common characteristics, such as the shadow and rear wheels beneath vehicles-of vehicles under various conditions. The common characteristics of vehicles are extracted by applying the stacked DoG shaped kernel obtained from the 3D plot of an image through a convolution method and investigating only certain regions that have a similar patterns. A new vehicle detection system is constructed by combining the novel stacked DoG feature extraction algorithm with the AdaBoost method. Experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed vehicle detection system under different conditions."
