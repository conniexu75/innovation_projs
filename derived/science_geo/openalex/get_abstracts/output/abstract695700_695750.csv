https://openalex.org/W4283325528,"Many pathogens exploit host cell-surface glycans. However, precise analyses of glycan ligands binding with heavily modified pathogen proteins can be confounded by overlapping sugar signals and/or compounded with known experimental constraints. Universal saturation transfer analysis (uSTA) builds on existing nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to provide an automated workflow for quantitating protein-ligand interactions. uSTA reveals that early-pandemic, B-origin-lineage severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike trimer binds sialoside sugars in an ""end-on"" manner. uSTA-guided modeling and a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure implicate the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) and confirm end-on binding. This finding rationalizes the effect of NTD mutations that abolish sugar binding in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Together with genetic variance analyses in early pandemic patient cohorts, this binding implicates a sialylated polylactosamine motif found on tetraantennary N-linked glycoproteins deep in the human lung as potentially relevant to virulence and/or zoonosis."
https://openalex.org/W4283325889,"Abstract Epileptogenic triggers are multifactorial and not well understood. Here we aimed to address the hypothesis that inappropriate pro-inflammatory mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of refractory epilepsy (non-responsiveness to antiepileptic drugs) in human patients. We used single-cell cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) to reveal the immunotranscriptome of surgically resected epileptic lesion tissues. Our approach uncovered a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, including extensive activation of microglia and infiltration of other pro-inflammatory immune cells. These findings were supported by ligand–receptor (LR) interactome analysis, which demonstrated potential mechanisms of infiltration and evidence of direct physical interactions between microglia and T cells. Together, these data provide insight into the immune microenvironment in epileptic tissue, which may aid the development of new therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4283311416,"Neutrophils migrating towards chemoattractant gradients amplify their recruitment range by releasing the secondary chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (LTB4) refs. 1,2. We previously demonstrated that LTB4 and its synthesizing enzymes, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), 5-LO activating protein (FLAP) and leukotriene A4 hydrolase, are packaged and released in exosomes3. Here we report that the biogenesis of the LTB4-containing exosomes originates at the nuclear envelope (NE) of activated neutrophils. We show that the neutral sphingomyelinase 1 (nSMase1)-mediated generation of ceramide-enriched lipid-ordered microdomains initiates the clustering of the LTB4-synthesizing enzymes on the NE. We isolated and analysed exosomes from activated neutrophils and established that the FLAP/5-LO-positive exosome population is distinct from that of the CD63-positive exosome population. Furthermore, we observed a strong co-localization between ALIX and FLAP at the periphery of nuclei and within cytosolic vesicles. We propose that the initiation of NE curvature and bud formation is mediated by nSMase1-dependent ceramide generation, which leads to FLAP and ALIX recruitment. Together, these observations elucidate the mechanism for LTB4 secretion and identify a non-conventional pathway for exosome generation. Arya et al. identify a pathway for exosome generation in immune cells that originates at the nuclear envelope and is facilitated by nSMase1-mediated generation of ceramide."

https://openalex.org/W4283327445,"RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) is a conserved mechanism that uses small RNAs (sRNAs) to silence gene expression. In the Caenorhabditis elegans germline, transcripts targeted by sRNAs are used as templates for sRNA amplification to propagate silencing into the next generation. Here we show that RNAi leads to heritable changes in the distribution of nascent and mature transcripts that correlate with two parallel sRNA amplification loops. The first loop, dependent on the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, targets nascent transcripts and reduces but does not eliminate productive transcription at the locus. The second loop, dependent on the conserved helicase ZNFX-1, targets mature transcripts and concentrates them in perinuclear condensates. ZNFX-1 interacts with sRNA-targeted transcripts that have acquired poly(UG) tails and is required to sustain pUGylation and robust sRNA amplification in the inheriting generation. By maintaining a pool of transcripts for amplification, ZNFX-1 prevents premature extinction of the RNAi response and extends silencing into the next generation."

Here, we generate >90% pure human artery or vein endothelial cells from pluripotent stem cells within 3-4 days. We specified artery cells by inhibiting vein-specifying signals and vice versa. These cells modeled viral infection of human vasculature by Nipah and Hendra viruses, which are extraordinarily deadly (∼57%-59% fatality rate) and require biosafety-level-4 containment. Generating pure populations of artery and vein cells highlighted that Nipah and Hendra viruses preferentially infected arteries; arteries expressed higher levels of their viral-entry receptor. Virally infected artery cells fused into syncytia containing up to 23 nuclei, which rapidly died. Despite infecting arteries and occupying ∼6%-17% of their transcriptome, Nipah and Hendra largely eluded innate immune detection, minimally eliciting interferon signaling. We thus efficiently generate artery and vein cells, introduce stem-cell-based toolkits for biosafety-level-4 virology, and explore the arterial tropism and cellular effects of Nipah and Hendra viruses."
https://openalex.org/W4283313285,"Metabolic reprogramming has been shown to be involved in cancer-induced pre-metastatic niche (PMN) formation, but the underlying mechanisms have been insufficiently explored. Here, we showed that hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1), a rate-limiting enzyme of oxalate synthesis, was upregulated in the alveolar epithelial cells of mice bearing metastatic breast cancer cells at the pre-metastatic stage, leading to oxalate accumulation in lung tissue. Lung oxalate accumulation induced neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation by activating NADPH oxidase, which facilitated the formation of pre-metastatic niche. In addition, lung oxalate accumulation promoted the proliferation of metastatic cancer cells by activating the MAPK signaling pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of HAO1 could effectively suppress the lung oxalate accumulation induced by primary cancer, consequently dampening lung metastasis of breast cancer. Breast cancer cells induced HAO1 expression and oxalate accumulation in alveolar epithelial cells by activating TLR3-IRF3 signaling. Collectively, these findings underscore the role of HAO1-mediated oxalate metabolism in cancer-induced lung PMN formation and metastasis. HAO1 could be an appealing therapeutic target for preventing lung metastasis of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4283325681,"Abstract When cells are stressed, bulk translation is often downregulated to reduce energy demands while stress-response proteins are simultaneously upregulated. To promote proteasome assembly and activity and maintain cell viability upon TORC1 inhibition, 19S regulatory-particle assembly chaperones (RPACs) are selectively translated. However, the molecular mechanism for such selective translational upregulation is unclear. Here, using yeast, we discover that remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton is important for RPAC translation following TORC1 inhibition. mRNA of the RPAC ADC17 is associated with actin cables and is enriched at cortical actin patches under stress, dependent upon the early endocytic protein Ede1. ede1 ∆ cells failed to induce RPACs and proteasome assembly upon TORC1 inhibition. Conversely, artificially tethering ADC17 mRNA to cortical actin patches enhanced its translation upon stress. These findings suggest that actin-dense structures such as cortical actin patches may serve as a translation platform for a subset of stress-induced mRNAs including regulators of proteasome homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4283464582,"The roles of literacy, fear and hesitancy were investigated for acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine (AV) types among village health volunteers (VHVs) in Thailand.A cross-sectional study was conducted using an unidentified online questionnaire to assess literacy, fear and hesitancy of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among Thai VHVs between 1 and 15 October 2021. The questionnaire was developed based on the HLVa-IT (Health Literacy Vaccinale degli adulti in Italiano) for vaccine literacy (VL), using an adult Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (aVHS) for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH) and Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCoV-19S) for the distress of COVID-19 vaccine. The effects of VL, VH and vaccine fear (VF) on AV were estimated using multivariable logistic regression.A total of 5,312 VHVs completed the questionnaire. After adjustment with variables in the multivariable analysis, the VL score was insignificantly associated with increased vaccination (aOR = 1.002; (95%CI: 0.994-1.01)), while VF and VH significantly decreased the chance of vaccination, aOR = 0.966 (95%CI: 0.953-0.978) and aOR = 0.969; (95%CI: 0.960-0.979), respectively and VF and VH were negatively associated with AV for all types of vaccine preference, with VL showing a reverse relationship only for mRNA-based vaccines.VL may not increase AV among VHVs. To increase attitudes toward receiving COVID-19 vaccination in Thailand, the government and health-related organizations should instigate policies to significantly reduce VF and VH among Thai VHVs."
https://openalex.org/W4283462349,"Introduction The United States has among the highest per capita red meat consumption in the world. Reducing red meat consumption is crucial for minimizing the environmental impact of diets and improving health outcomes. Warning messages are effective for reducing purchases of products like sugary beverages but have not been developed for red meat. This study developed health and environmental warning messages about red meat and explored participants’ reactions to these messages. Methods A national convenience sample of US red meat consumers ( n = 1,199; mean age 45 years) completed an online survey in 2020 for this exploratory study. Participants were randomized to view a series of either health or environmental warning messages (between-subjects factor) about the risks associated with eating red meat. Messages were presented in random order (within-subjects factor; 8 health messages or 10 environmental messages). Participants rated each warning message on a validated 3-item scale measuring perceived message effectiveness (PME), ranging from 1 (low) to 5 (high). Participants then rated their intentions to reduce their red meat consumption in the next 7 days. Results Health warning messages elicited higher PME ratings than environmental messages (mean 2.66 vs. 2.26, p &lt;0.001). Health warning messages also led to stronger intentions to reduce red meat consumption compared to environmental messages (mean 2.45 vs. 2.19, p&lt; 0.001). Within category (health and environmental), most pairwise comparisons of harms were not statistically significant. Conclusions Health warning messages were perceived to be more effective than environmental warning messages. Future studies should measure the impact of these messages on behavioral outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4283370565,"Background There is growing evidence of a strong relationship between COVID-19 and myocarditis. However, there are few bioinformatics-based analyses of critical genes and the mechanisms related to COVID-19 Myocarditis. This study aimed to identify critical genes related to COVID-19 Myocarditis by bioinformatic methods, explore the biological mechanisms and gene regulatory networks, and probe related drugs. Methods The gene expression data of GSE150392 and GSE167028 were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), including cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and GSE150392 from patients with myocarditis infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the GSE167028 gene expression dataset. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (adjusted P-Value &lt;0.01 and |Log2 Fold Change| ≥2) in GSE150392 were assessed by NetworkAnalyst 3.0. Meanwhile, significant modular genes in GSE167028 were identified by weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and overlapped with DEGs to obtain common genes. Functional enrichment analyses were performed by using the ""clusterProfiler"" package in the R software, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed on the STRING website ( https://cn.string-db.org/ ). Critical genes were identified by the CytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape by 5 algorithms. Transcription factor-gene (TF-gene) and Transcription factor-microRibonucleic acid (TF-miRNA) coregulatory networks construction were performed by NetworkAnalyst 3.0 and displayed in Cytoscape. Finally, Drug Signatures Database (DSigDB) was used to probe drugs associated with COVID-19 Myocarditis. Results Totally 850 DEGs (including 449 up-regulated and 401 down-regulated genes) and 159 significant genes in turquoise modules were identified from GSE150392 and GSE167028, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that common genes were mainly enriched in biological processes such as cell cycle and ubiquitin-protein hydrolysis. 6 genes ( CDK1 , KIF20A , PBK , KIF2C , CDC20 , UBE2C ) were identified as critical genes. TF-gene interactions and TF-miRNA coregulatory network were constructed successfully. A total of 10 drugs, (such as Etoposide, Methotrexate, Troglitazone, etc) were considered as target drugs for COVID-19 Myocarditis. Conclusions Through bioinformatics method analysis, this study provides a new perspective to explore the pathogenesis, gene regulatory networks and provide drug compounds as a reference for COVID-19 Myocarditis. It is worth highlighting that critical genes ( CDK1 , KIF20A , PBK , KIF2C , CDC20 , UBE2C) may be potential biomarkers and treatment targets of COVID-19 Myocarditis for future study."
https://openalex.org/W4283384545,"Our ability to recall memories is improved when sleep follows learning, suggesting that sleep facilitates memory consolidation. A number of factors are thought to influence the impact of sleep on newly learned information, such as whether or not we rehearse that information (e.g. via restudy or retrieval practice), or the extent to which the information is consistent with our pre-existing schematic knowledge. In this pre-registered, online study, we examined the effects of both rehearsal and schematic congruency on overnight consolidation. Participants learned noun-colour pairings (e.g. elephant-red) and rated each pairing as plausible or implausible before completing a baseline memory assessment. Afterwards, participants engaged in a period of restudy or retrieval practice for the pairings, and then entered a 12 h retention interval of overnight sleep or daytime wakefulness. Follow-up assessments were completed immediately after sleep or wake, and again 24 h after learning. Our data indicated that overnight consolidation was amplified for restudied relative to retested noun-colour pairings, but only when sleep occurred soon after learning. Furthermore, whereas plausible (i.e. schematically congruent) pairings were generally better remembered than implausible (i.e. schematically incongruent) pairings, the benefits of sleep were stronger for implausible relative to plausible memories. These findings challenge the notion that schema-conformant memories are preferentially strengthened during post-learning sleep."
https://openalex.org/W4283392632,"One strategy for the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is the implementation of the front-of-pack labeling (FoPL) in foods and beverages. In 2020, Mexico adopted the warning label system (WL) as a new public health policy, whose aim is to help consumers make healthier food choices. Previously, the Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) was the labelling used it. This paper aims to compare the understanding of two FoPL, the GDA and the WL, through the identification of unhealthy products in Mexicans with NCDs. We analyzed data from 14,880 Mexican adults older than 20 years old with NCDs (overweight-obesity ( OW/O ), self-reported diabetes mellitus 2 ( DM2 ), or/and hypertension ( HT ), or/and dyslipidemia ( Dys )). Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the GDA labeling or WL. Each group had to respond to a survey and had to classify food products images as healthy or unhealthy according to the labelling system to which they were assigned. The correct classification was determined according to the criteria of Chile’s labeling nutrient profile stage 3. To evaluate the correct classification in each one of the groups we evaluated the differences in proportions. Logistic regression models were used to assess the likelihood to correctly classify the product according to participants’ number of diseases and WL information, taking GDA label as a reference. Participants who used the information contained in the GDA label misclassified food product labels in greater proportion (70%), mostly participants with three or more NCDs (participants with OW/O+ HT+ Dys , represent 42.3% of this group); compared with those who used WL (50%). The odds of correct classification of food products using WL image were two times greater compared to GDA image in participants with NCDs; being greater in participants with three or more NCDs . The study results highlight the usefulness of WL as it helps Mexicans with NCDs to classify unhealthy food products more adequately compared with GDA."
https://openalex.org/W4283394019,"Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration (IVDD) is closely linked to degenerative spinal disease, resulting in disability, poor quality of life, and financial burden. Apoptosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells (NPCs) is a key pathological basis of IVDD. Periostin (POSTN), an extracellular matrix protein, is expressed in many tissues, whereas its abnormal expression is associated with IVDD. The conventional Wnt/β-catenin pathway is also involved in IVDD and contributes to NPCs apoptosis. However, research on the mechanisms of POSTN in IVDD is lacking. This study investigated the relationship between POSTN and β-catenin expression in degenerated IVDs. We detected the expression of POSTN, β-catenin, and cleaved-caspase-3 (C-caspase3) in degenerated and non-degenerated IVD tissues of different grades (n = 8) using RT-qPCR, immunohistochemical staining, and western blotting analysis. Next, we explored the effects of recombinant periostin (rPOSTN) and isoquercitrin (Iso), an inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, on NPCs apoptosis. Finally, we inhibited the expression of POSTN in degenerated NPCs in vivo and investigated the anti-apoptotic effect. The expression of β-catenin, POSTN, and C-caspase3 in severe degenerative IVDs was significantly higher than that in mild degenerative IVDs. These findings were confirmed in rat and cell-based degenerative models. When treated with rPOSTN, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity and cell apoptosis were time- and dose-dependent. However, rPOSTN-induced NPCs apoptosis decreased after iso-induced inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. POSTN inhibition reduced apoptosis but was restored by rPOSTN re-addition. Lastly, POSTN inhibition ameliorated puncture-induced IVDD in vivo. Overall, our study demonstrated that POSTN promotes NPCs apoptosis and aggravates degeneration by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4283155860,"RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) are noncanonical RNA secondary structures formed by guanine (G)-rich sequences. These complexes play important regulatory roles in both animals and plants through their structural dynamics and are closely related to human diseases and plant growth, development, and adaption. Thus, studying the structural dynamics of rG4s is fundamentally important; however, their folding pathways and their unfolding by specialized helicases are not well understood. In addition, no plant rG4-specialized helicases have been identified. Here, using single-molecule FRET, we experimentally elucidated for the first time the folding pathway and intermediates, including a G-hairpin and G-triplex. In addition, using proteomics screening and microscale thermophoresis, we identified and validated five rG4-specialized helicases in Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, DExH1, the ortholog of the famous human rG4 helicase RHAU/DHX36, stood out for its robust rG4 unwinding ability. Taken together, these results shed light on the structural dynamics of plant rG4s."
https://openalex.org/W4283172499,"The integrin receptor αMβ2 mediates phagocytosis of complement-opsonized objects, adhesion to the extracellular matrix, and transendothelial migration of leukocytes. However, the mechanistic aspects of αMβ2 signaling upon ligand binding are unclear. Here, we present the first atomic structure of the human αMβ2 headpiece fragment in complex with the nanobody (Nb) hCD11bNb1 at a resolution of 3.2 Å. We show that the receptor headpiece adopts the closed conformation expected to exhibit low ligand affinity. The crystal structure indicates that in the R77H αM variant, associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, the modified allosteric relationship between ligand binding and integrin outside-inside signaling is due to subtle conformational effects transmitted over a distance of 40 Å. Furthermore, we found the Nb binds to the αI domain of the αM subunit in an Mg2+-independent manner with low nanomolar affinity. Biochemical and biophysical experiments with purified proteins demonstrated that the Nb acts as a competitive inhibitor through steric hindrance exerted on the thioester domain of complement component iC3b attempting to bind the αM subunit. Surprisingly, we show that the Nb stimulates the interaction of cell-bound αMβ2 with iC3b, suggesting that it may represent a novel high-affinity proteinaceous αMβ2-specific agonist. Taken together, our data suggest that the iC3b-αMβ2 complex may be more dynamic than predicted from the crystal structure of the core complex. We propose a model based on the conformational spectrum of the receptor to reconcile these observations regarding the functional consequences of hCD11bNb1 binding to αMβ2."
https://openalex.org/W4283368502,"Glomerular damage indicated by proteinuria is a main symptom in diabetic nephropathy. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists (MRAs) are beneficial irrespective of aldosterone availability. Thus, we hypothesized an alternatively activated MR to promote glomerular damage in proteinuric diabetic nephropathy. Specifically, we aimed first to demonstrate the presence of steroid hormones serving as alternative MR targets in type II diabetic patients with proteinuric kidney disease, second whether MR selectivity was modified, third to characterize MR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and activity in glomerular cell types exposed to eu- and hyperglycemic conditions, fourth to characterize the pro-fibrotic potential of primary human renal mesangial cells (HRMC) upon stimulation with aldosterone and cortisol, and fifth to specify the involvement of the MR and/or GR in pro-fibrotic signaling.Urinary steroid hormone profiles of patients with diabetic kidney disease were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and compared to an age and gender matched healthy control group taken out of a population study. In both cohorts, the activity of the MR pre-receptor enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD11B2), which inactivates cortisol to prevent it from binding to the MR, was assessed to define a change in MR selectivity. Expression of HSD11B2, MR and GR was quantified in HRMC and primary human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGEC). Activity of MR and GR was explored in HRMC by measuring the MR/GR down-stream signal SGK1 and the pro-fibrotic genes TGFB1, FN1 and COL1A1 in normal and high glucose conditions with the MR/GR agonists aldosterone/cortisol and the MR/GR antagonists spironolactone/RU486.Patients with diabetic kidney disease excreted more tetrahydroaldosterone than the control group reaching significance in men. The excretion of MR-agonistic steroid hormones was only increased for 18-hydroxytetrahydrocorticosterone in diabetic women. The excretion of most glucocorticoids was higher in the diabetic cohort. Higher apparent systemic HSD11B2 activity suggested less activation of the MR by cortisol in diabetic patients. Both cell types, HRMC and HRGEC, lacked expression of HSD11B2. Hyperglycemic conditions did not change MR and GR expression and activity. Stimulation with both aldosterone and cortisol promoted upregulation of pro-fibrotic genes in HRMC. This effect of MR and/or GR activation was more pronounced in high glucose conditions and partially inhibited by MRAs and GR antagonists.In patients with diabetic kidney disease alternative MR activation is conceivable as cortisol and cortisone metabolites are increased. Systemic availability of active metabolites is counteracted via an increased HSD11B2 activity. As this cortisol deactivation is absent in HRMC and HRGEC, cortisol binding to the MR is enabled. Both, cortisol and aldosterone stimulation led to an increased expression of pro-fibrotic genes in HRMC. This mechanism was related to the MR as well as the GR and more marked in high glucose conditions linking the benefit of MRAs in diabetic kidney disease to these findings."
https://openalex.org/W4283465708,"The coordinated efforts to stop the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) include massive immunization of the population at a global scale. The humoral immunity against COVID-19 is conferred by neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that occur during the post-infection period and upon vaccination. Here, we provide robust data showing that potent neutralizing antibodies are induced in convalescent patients of SARS-CoV-2 infection who have been immunized with different types of vaccines, and patients with no previous history of COVID-19 immunized with a mixed vaccination schedule regardless of the previous infection. More importantly, we showed that a heterologous prime-boost in individuals with Ad5-nCoV (Cansino) vaccine induces higher NAbs levels in comparison to a single vaccination scheme alone."
https://openalex.org/W4283216927,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, proteins destined for secretion utilize the post-translational translocon machinery to gain entry into the endoplasmic reticulum. These proteins then mature by undergoing a number of post-translational modifications in different compartments of the secretory pathway. While these modifications have been well established for many proteins, to date only a few studies have been conducted regarding the conditions and factors affecting maturation of these proteins before entering into the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, using immunoblotting, microscopy, and spot test assays, we show that excess copper inhibits the Sec61 translocon function and causes accumulation of two well-known post-translationally translocated proteins, Gas1 (glycophospholipid-anchored surface protein) and CPY (carboxypeptidase Y), in the cytosol. We further show that the copper-sensitive phenotype of sec61-deficient yeast cells is ameliorated by restoring the levels of SEC61 through plasmid transformation. Furthermore, screening of translocation-defective Sec61 mutants revealed that sec61-22, bearing L80M, V134I, M248V, and L342S mutations, is resistant to copper, suggesting that copper might be inflicting toxicity through one of these residues.

In conclusion, these findings imply that copper-mediated accumulation of post-translationally translocated proteins is due to the inhibition of Sec61. Copper, an essential element, is required by multiple enzymes, such as lysyl oxidase, cytochrome C, superoxide dismutase, and others (1Kodama H. Fujisawa C. Bhadhprasit W. Inherited copper transport disorders: Biochemical mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment.Curr. Drug Metab. 2012; 13: 237-250Google Scholar). Copper sensing in yeast and ergo, the decision for its uptake, or sequestration/export are mediated primarily by two transcription factors, Ace1 and Mac1 (2Keller G. Bird A. Winge D.R. Independent metalloregulation of Ace1 and Mac1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1863-1871Google Scholar). If the cells sense excessive copper in the extracellular milieu, then Ace1 undergoes a change in its conformation to convert into an active form. This activated transcription factor binds to the promoter of genes like CUP1, CRS5 (metallothioneins), as well as SOD1, which serves as a reservoir of ligand-bound copper in the intracellular milieu as the excess copper may induce production of free radicals resulting in cellular destruction (3Thiele D.J. ACE1 regulates expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae metallothionein gene.Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 2745-2752Google Scholar). On the contrary, in the copper-deficit condition, the copper uptake genes are activated by Mac1 (4Pena M.M. Lee J. Thiele D.J. A delicate balance: homeostatic control of copper uptake and distribution.J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Google Scholar). Since the mammalian system inhabits a number of orthologs of copper metabolism–related enzymes in yeast, in-depth studies in this simple eukaryote have provided critical insights into the mammalian system. The mammalian orthologs of copper metabolism are stringently regulated by co-ordination of multiple transcription factors, which reflect maintenance of this essential metal in extremely different and unique levels from cells to organs (5Ehrensberger K.M. Bird A.J. Hammering out details: regulating metal levels in eukaryotes.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 524-531Google Scholar). As a result, any perturbation in copper metabolism results in serious consequences. For example, Menkes disease because of mutations in the ATP7A gene is characterized by intestinal copper accumulation, whereas its depletion in the enzymes of the peripheral region (6Nyasae L.

Harrison S.C. et al.X-ray structure of a protein-conducting channel.Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Google Scholar). The core structure of the Sec61p, approximately 53 kDa protein, comprises 10 transmembrane (TM) helices. These helices are separated by loops, out of which L6 plays a role in translocation of proteins, whereas L8 contains a highly conserved residue, which is positively charged and provides a major ribosome-binding site (15Cheng Z.

Sbh1, the beta subunit of translocon, is a small protein of approximately 8.7 kDa. Structurally, it has a single TM domain at C-terminal region and a cytosolic N-terminal region previously thought to have guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity. However, it is no longer believed to contain a GEF activity. Both Sbh1 and its homolog Sbh2 are nonessential yeast genes and that the translocation defects of a Δsbh1Δsbh2 mutant can be suppressed by expression of the TM span of Sbh1, which argues against the presence of a cytoplasmic GEF domain (16Toikkanen J.H.

Sss1 is an essential small protein of the complex, which is an integral membrane protein with its amino terminal exposed to the cytosol (19Esnault Y. Feldheim D. Blondel M.O. Schekman R. Kepes F. SSS1 encodes a stabilizing component of the Sec61 subcomplex of the yeast protein translocation apparatus.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27478-27485Google Scholar). Multiple structural studies of the trimeric complex from different species have revealed details about the mechanism through which the polypeptides enter the protein-conducting channel to reach into the lumen or become associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. X-ray structures of protein-conducting channel from Methanococcus jannaschii (14Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. et al.X-ray structure of a protein-conducting channel.Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Google Scholar) and monomeric yeast Sec61 complexes (20Becker T. Bhushan S. Jarasch A. Armache J.P. Funes S. Jossinet F. et al.Structure of monomeric yeast and mammalian Sec61 complexes interacting with the translating ribosome.Science. 2009; 326: 1369-1373Google Scholar) have revealed the plausible structural changes in the translocation when shifting from idle (not engaged by polypeptide) state to active state (engaged by polypeptide). In its idle state, the channel pore remains closed by a plug domain and an additional ring of hydrophobic residues. Together, they block the outer cytoplasmic environment from the inner ER lumen. However, when the signal sequence bearing polypeptide approaches the channel, the interactions holding the plug in its position are destabilized, and so the plug shifts making room for the polypeptide to pass through. The ring of hydrophobic residues forms a seal around the passing polypeptide to prevent the entry of small molecules from the cytoplasm into the lumen (14Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. et al.X-ray structure of a protein-conducting channel.Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Google Scholar, 20Becker T. Bhushan S. Jarasch A. Armache J.P. Funes S. Jossinet F. et al.Structure of monomeric yeast and mammalian Sec61 complexes interacting with the translating ribosome.Science. 2009; 326: 1369-1373Google Scholar). In the case of cotranslational translocation, only the association between protein-conducting Sec61 and the ribosome’s exit tunnel is required (20Becker T. Bhushan S. Jarasch A. Armache J.P. Funes S.

While for post-translational translocation, the complex partners with Sec62–Sec63 complex. The Sec62–Sec63 complex is composed of two essential subunits, Sec62p and Sec63p, and two nonessential subunits, Sec71p and Sec72p (22Deshaies R.J. Sanders S.L. Feldheim D.A. Schekman R.

Rothblatt J. Hosobuchi M. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Protein translocation mutants defective in the insertion of integral membrane proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 129-142Google Scholar). Plethora of proteins, utilizing the secretory pathway, is synthesized in the cytosol in their inactive form. These proteins are translocated to ER, where they are folded and post-translationally modified and then transferred to Golgi, where further modifications take place to finally reach their diverse destinations in the active form (24Delic M. Valli M. Graf A.B. Pfeffer M. Mattanovich D. Gasser B. The secretory pathway: exploring yeast diversity.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2013; 37: 872-914Google Scholar). For example, glycophospholipid-anchored surface protein (Gas1), a β-(1, 3)-glucan elongase protein, is post-translationally modified through the attachment of a glycolipid moiety called glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) at their C-terminal end. This attachment facilitates the anchoring of protein to the plasma membrane’s outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer (25Popolo L. Ragni E. Carotti C. Palomares O. Aardema R. Back J.W. et al.Disulfide bond structure and domain organization of yeast beta(1,3)-glucanosyltransferases involved in cell wall biogenesis.J. Biol.

Immobilization of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Gas1 protein into the chitin ring and septum is required for proper morphogenesis in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4856-4870Google Scholar). Similarly, carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) is synthesized in the form of preproenzyme. The preproenzyme enters in the ER lumen through post-translational translocation, where the signal sequence is cleaved resulting in proCPY after which the enzyme gets folded through disulphide bond formation and glycosylation to give the p1CPY form; the enzyme is then transported to Golgi, where the outer mannose residues are added giving rise to p2CPY. Finally, inside the vacuole, proteinase B cleaves the p2CPY to form the mature CPY (27Pilon M. Romisch K. Quach D. Schekman R. Sec61p serves multiple roles in secretory precursor binding and translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3455-3473Google Scholar). Molecules specifically inhibiting the translocon channel may aid in elucidating the underlying functional mechanisms of the complex. A number of molecules from different sources have shown the potential of inhibiting the translocation of cotranslationally and post-translationally targeting proteins. In case of apratoxin A, the molecule has been shown to hamper the cotranslational translocation in in vitro condition (28Liu Y. Law B.K. Luesch H. Apratoxin a reversibly inhibits the secretory pathway by preventing cotranslational translocation.Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 91-104Google Scholar), whereas group of molecules called cotransins inhibits specific translocating substrates by targeting the Sec61α (29Besemer J. Harant H. Wang S.

An allosteric Sec61 inhibitor traps nascent transmembrane helices at the lateral gate.Elife. 2014; 3e01483Google Scholar). More recently, a new natural metabolite isolated from the organism Chaetosphaeria tulasneorum has been shown to target the Sec61 translocon machinery of the yeast and mammals. The translocation of both cotranslationally and post-translationally translocating substrates was inhibited. Furthermore, dominant mutations of Sec61, isolated, post the mutagenesis and genome sequencing of yeast and mammalian cells, conferred resistance against the isolated metabolite. Finally, these resistant mutants were shown to exhibit the prl phenotype. prl mutants mimic partially opened channel of Sec61 and so allow the passing of defective signal bearing secretory proteins, which are otherwise blocked by the WT Sec61. Thus, it was concluded that the metabolite most probably binds to the closed translocon structure so that it fails to open for the efficient translocation of proteins (32Junne T. Wong J. Studer C. Aust T. Bauer B.W. Beibel M. et al.Decatransin, a new natural product inhibiting protein translocation at the Sec61/SecYEG translocon.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 1217-1229Google Scholar). Reports suggest that copper effects the glycosylation levels of secretory proteins in multiple cell lines (33Yuk I.H. Russell S. Tang Y. Hsu W.T. Mauger J.B. Aulakh R.P. et al.Effects of copper on CHO cells: cellular requirements and product quality considerations.Biotechnol. Prog. 2015; 31: 226-238Google Scholar). The underlying reason for the phenomenon is still obscure. While the role of transition metals in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation or in the replacement of metals in metallothioneins is extensively studied, its effect on the maturation of secretory proteins has never been explored (34Jomova K. Valko M. Advances in metal-induced oxidative stress and human disease.Toxicology. 2011; 283: 65-87Google Scholar, 35Gaetke L.M. Chow-Johnson H.S. Chow C.K. Copper: Toxicological relevance and mechanisms.Arch. Toxicol. 2014; 88: 1929-1938Google Scholar, 36Meucci E. Mordente A. Martorana G.E. Metal-catalyzed oxidation of human serum albumin: conformational and functional changes. Implications in protein aging.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4692-4699Google Scholar). In an attempt to explore the possible role of these metals in the maturation of secretory proteins, we tested the effect of multiple metals on the secretory protein maturation (Gas1, data not shown) and found that treatment with copper leads to accumulation of immature form. In this communication, we attempt to address the question by checking the effect of copper on two different secretory proteins, Gas1 and CPY. We first report the selective accumulation of immature Gas1 by copper (CuCl2.2H2O) treatment of yeast cells. The accumulation of immature Gas1 protein was reversed by treatment of cells with ethanolamine (ETA) and specific copper chelator bathocuproinedisulfonic acid disodium salt (BCS). The molecular weight of the immature protein revealed that the Gas1 protein was throttled as unglycosylated form. Tunicamycin (Tm) treatment in WT yeast cells has been shown to accumulate unglycosylated form of red fluorescent protein-Gas1 (37Aviram N. Ast T. Costa E.A. Arakel E.C. Chuartzman S.G. Jan C.H. et al.The SND proteins constitute an alternative targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum.Nature. 2016; 540: 134-138Google Scholar). We found that the form of copper accumulated showed similar migration as the Tm-treated Gas1. Furthermore, we found that another signal recognition particle–independent protein CPY, in the presence of copper, accumulated as a slower migrating protein band than the Tm-treated bands pointing at the accumulation of proproteins (38Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K. Sec61p mediates export of a misfolded secretory protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol for degradation.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Google Scholar, 39Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. The essential OST2 gene encodes the 16-kD subunit of the yeast oligosaccharyltransferase, a highly conserved protein expressed in diverse eukaryotic organisms.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Google Scholar). We reasoned, if copper treatment leads to accumulation of protein in the prepro form, then the compound must be targeting the translocon. Both Gas1p and CPY utilize the Sec61 complex to gain access into the ER lumen where further post-translational modifications occur (26Rolli E. Ragni E. Calderon J. Porello S. Fascio U. Popolo L. Immobilization of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Gas1 protein into the chitin ring and septum is required for proper morphogenesis in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4856-4870Google Scholar, 38Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K. Sec61p mediates export of a misfolded secretory protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol for degradation.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Google Scholar). On testing various components of the translocon complex, cells with lower levels of Sec61p showed compromised growth in the presence of copper. The growth-sensitive phenotype of Sec61 mutant in copper is rescued upon restoration of Sec61 levels through plasmid. The sec61-DAmP yeast cells reported to accumulate precursor Gas1p (40Ast T. Cohen G. Schuldiner M. A network of cytosolic factors targets SRP-independent proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum.Cell. 2013; 152: 1134-1145Google Scholar) also accumulated the preproCPY. The immature protein band of CPY corresponds to the band accumulated under copper treatment. We also tested Sec61 translocation-defective mutants (27Pilon M. Romisch K. Quach D. Schekman R. Sec61p serves multiple roles in secretory precursor binding and translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3455-3473Google Scholar) in copper and found that only sec61-22, inhabiting mutations at L80M, V134I, M248V, and L342S, was resistant to copper. Thus, our results strongly suggest that copper may inhibit the Sec61 translocon–mediated entry/release of these proteins into the ER lumen. To investigate the effect of copper on Gas1p maturation, BY4743 yeast cells transformed with pRS415 Gas1-GFP (41Ha C.W. Kim K. Chang Y.J. Kim B. Huh W.K. The beta-1,3-glucanosyltransferase Gas1 regulates Sir2-mediated rDNA stability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nucl. Acids Res. 2014; 42: 8486-8499Google Scholar) were treated with different copper concentrations, viz. 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mM, and cells were harvested at different time points, viz. 30′, 60′, and 90’. Following the harvest, we extracted the proteins and performed immunoblotting. Our result (Fig. 1A) clearly shows that the accumulation of precursor Gas1p is proportional to the concentration of copper used, and the time for which cells were exposed to copper (Fig. 1, A and D) shows that treatment with 1 mM copper at 90′ led to accumulation of the highest amount of Gas1p precursor form at 58% ± 14% compared with the untreated (UT) at 31% ± 13%. BCS is a specific copper chelator that is routinely used in yeast biology to reverse the effect of copper (42Dong K. Addinall S.G. Lydall D. Rutherford J.C. The yeast copper response is regulated by DNA damage.Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 33: 4041-4050Google Scholar). To prove that copper is responsible for the accumulation of the immature protein, we cotreated cells with copper and BCS. The result (Fig. 1B) shows that indeed the addition of BCS rescues the accumulation of precursor form. While UT or copper-treated cells accumulated immature proteins at 24% ± 5% and 58% ± 2%, respectively; addition of BCS reduced the accumulation to about 32% ± 14% or 34% ± 14% at concentrations of 1 and 1.5 mM BCS, respectively (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, we checked another copper chelator, ETA, which is known to form complex with copper (43Caumul P. Boodhoo K. Burkutally S.B. Seeruttun S. Namooya N. Ramsahye N. et al.Synthesis and analysis of metal chelating amino and diamine precursors and their complex formation on copper (II) using conductivity and spectroscopic methods.Res. J. Pharm. Biol. Chem. Sci. 2014; 5: 494-509Google Scholar). Upon cosupplementation, the accumulation of immature form was reversed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C and F). We found while the UT and copper-treated cells accumulate about 20% ± 6% and 61% ± 7% immature form, respectively. Cotreatment with ETA at 2.5 mM concentration reduced the accumulation to 45% ± 7%. Spot test assay of untransformed BY4743 cells showed that the deleterious effect on cell growth by copper was ameliorated by BCS (Fig. 1G). We did growth curve analysis of untransformed BY4743 cells and found that 1 mM copper was able to exert effect on the growth of cells in liquid culture, which was ameliorated by cotreatment of ETA and BCS, respectively (Fig. 1, H and I). We also checked the response of the transformed cells in the presence of copper, which inhibited the growth with increasing concentration (Fig. S1A). Since Gas1p was tagged with GFP, we next tested the localization of Gas1-GFP signal in the cell through microscopy. To this end, we transformed the GSHY583 strain containing the N-terminal ER signal sequence, dsRed, and an HDEL tag (44Suresh H.G. da Silveira Dos Santos A.X. Kukulski W. Tyedmers J. Riezman H. Bukau B. et al.Prolonged starvation drives reversible sequestration of lipid biosynthetic enzymes and organelle reorganization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2015; 26: 1601-1615Google Scholar). After confirming that the transformed GSHY583 cells treated with copper showed accumulation of Gas1 precursor form (Fig. 2A), we performed microscopy to assess the localization of this precursor form. Figure 2B shows that the copper-treated cells exhibited marked difference in Gas1 distribution compared with the UT cells. In the UT cells, Gas1 is present at the nuclear rim and the cortical ER region in the mother cells but only in the cortical ER in the new buds. However, in the copper-treated cells, the cortical distribution of the protein is majorily distorted with almost no puncta or tubes. Moreover, the copper-treated cells show an increase in the diffused cytoplasmic Gas1-GFP signal compared with the UT cells. Interestingly, we found that the signal sequence–attached DsRed protein also exhibited similar pattern as the Gas1 protein (Fig. 2B) under copper treatment. Inspection of the signal sequence–attached dsRed-HDEL revealed that it is a Kar2 signal sequence. As Kar2 partly utilizes signal recognition particle-independent translocation like Gas1 (45Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Google Scholar), it shows defective distribution upon copper treatment. Thus, we conclude that copper treatment results in accumulation of immature Gas1p.Figure 2Immature Gas1p accumulated under copper appears to be in the cytosol.

Sendecki A.M. Cong X. Cremer P.S. Cu(2+) binds to phosphatidylethanolamine and increases oxidation in lipid membranes.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 1584-1590Google Scholar, 47Birner R.

Roles of phosphatidylethanolamine and of its several biosynthetic pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we checked the maturation of CPY, a non-GPI–anchored secretory protein. To this end, we endogenously myc tagged the CPY protein in BY4741 and tested the effect of copper on its growth (Fig. S1B). We then checked the effect of copper on CPY protein maturation. Results (Fig. 3, A and E) show the accumulation of immature CPY protein band under copper treatment, thereby ruling out the possibility that the absence of GPI anchor attachment might be causing the accumulation of immature Gas1p. The UT cells accumulated 15% ± 1%, whereas copper-treated cells accumulated 60% ± 8% and 66% ± 8% immature protein at concentrations of 0.75 and 1 mM, respectively. Slowly migrating bands of both, Gas1p and CPY, resembled the size of unglycosylated forms of these proteins. We debated, if the faster migrating band obtained under copper treatment is indeed the unglycosylated form, then"
https://openalex.org/W4283363177,"Nociceptors are a type of sensory neuron that are integral to most forms of pain. Targeted disruption of nociceptor sensitization affords unique opportunities to prevent pain. An emerging model for nociceptors are sensory neurons derived from human stem cells. Here, we subjected five groups to high-throughput sequencing: human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) prior to differentiation, mature hiPSC-derived sensory neurons, mature co-cultures containing hiPSC-derived astrocytes and sensory neurons, mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissues, and mouse DRG cultures. Co-culture of nociceptors and astrocytes promotes expression of transcripts enriched in DRG tissues. Comparisons of the hiPSC models to tissue samples reveal that many key transcripts linked to pain are present. Markers indicative of a range of neuronal subtypes present in the DRG were detected in mature hiPSCs. Intriguingly, translation factors were maintained at consistently high expression levels across species and culture systems. As a proof of concept for the utility of this resource, we validated expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) in DRG tissues and hiPSC samples. eIF5A is subject to a unique posttranslational hypusine modification required for its activity. Inhibition of hypusine biosynthesis prevented hyperalgesic priming by inflammatory mediators in vivo and diminished hiPSC activity in vitro. Collectively, our results illuminate the transcriptomes of hiPSC sensory neuron models. We provide a demonstration for this resource through our investigation of eIF5A. Our findings reveal hypusine as a potential target for inflammation associated pain in males."
https://openalex.org/W4283368850,"Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is a common disease that threatens human health. At present, no treatment can cure PAH, and the prognosis is poor. Therefore, it is important to determine new targets for PAH treatment. Recently, a novel endogenous ligand Apela (ELABELA/Toddler/ELA32) of apelin peptide jejunum (APJ) receptor was identified as a possible PAH target. This study explored the potential effect of Apela gene therapy on rats with PAH. An AAV-ELA32 recombinant expression vector was constructed by molecular cloning. Purified adeno-associated virus (AAV) was injected into monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH rats via tail vein 1 and 2 weeks after modeling. Apela gene therapy significantly reduced the increased right ventricular systolic pressure and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in PAH rats. The results of histopathology and immunofluorescence showed that Apela gene therapy not only reduced the rate of pulmonary arteriole muscularization and media thickening in PAH rats but also inhibited the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition of the pulmonary arteriole. Western blotting showed that Apela gene therapy up-regulated the expression of KLF2/eNOs and BMPRII/SMAD4 in pulmonary arterioles of PAH rats. Overall, the results show that Apela gene therapy can inhibit pulmonary arteriolar vascular remodeling and reduce pulmonary artery pressure in PAH rats. These effects may be related to KLF2/eNOs and BMPRII/SMAD4 signaling pathways. The apelinergic system may be a potential new target for the prevention and treatment of PAH."

Large cohort studies are needed to characterize the independent impact of environmental exposures on mortality in low-income settings.We collected data on individual and environmental risk factors for a multiethnic cohort of 50,045 individuals in a low-income region in Iran. Environmental risk factors included: ambient fine particular matter air pollution; household fuel use and ventilation; proximity to traffic; distance to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) center; socioeconomic environment; population density; local land use; and nighttime light exposure. We developed a spatial survival model to estimate the independent associations between these environmental exposures and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.Several environmental factors demonstrated associations with mortality after adjusting for individual risk factors. Ambient fine particulate matter air pollution predicted all-cause mortality (per μg/m3, HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07, 1.36) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.98, 1.39). Biomass fuel use without chimney predicted all-cause mortality (reference = gas, HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.99, 1.53) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.99, 1.87). Kerosene fuel use without chimney predicted all-cause mortality (reference = gas, HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97, 1.23) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01, 1.41). Distance to PCI center predicted all-cause mortality (per 10km, HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.004, 1.022) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.004, 1.031). Additionally, proximity to traffic predicted all-cause mortality (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01, 1.27). In a separate validation cohort, the multivariable model effectively predicted both all-cause mortality (AUC 0.76) and cardiovascular mortality (AUC 0.81).

https://openalex.org/W4283388563,"The purpose of this study is to compare differences between kinematic parameters of pediatric gait obtained by direct kinematics (DK) (Plug-in-Gait) and inverse kinematics (IK) (AnyBody) models. Seventeen healthy children participated in this study. Both lower extremities were examined using a Vicon 8-camera motion capture system and a force plate. Angles of the hip, knee, and ankle joints were obtained based on DK and IK models, and ranges of motion (ROMs) were identified from them. The standard error of measurement, root-mean-squared error, correlation r , and magnitude-phase (MP) metrics were calculated to compare differences between the models’ outcomes. The determined standard error of measurement between ROMs from the DK and IK models ranged from 0.34° to 0.58°. A significant difference was found in the ROMs with the exception of the left hip’s internal/external rotation. The mean RMSE of all joints’ amplitudes exceeded the clinical significance limit and was 13.6 ± 4.0°. The best curve angles matching nature were found in the sagittal plane, where r was 0.79 to 0.83 and MP metrics were 0.05 to 0.30. The kinematic parameters of pediatric gait obtained by IK and DK differ significantly. Preferably, all of the results obtained by DK must be validated/verified by IK, in order to achieve a more accurate functional assessment of the individual. Furthermore, the use of IK expands the capabilities of gait analysis and allows for kinetic characterisation."

Here, by solving the high-resolution crystal structure of Harmonin PDZ2 and coiled-coil domains in a complex with the tail of cadherin-related family member 2, we demonstrated that mutations located in the Harmonin PDZ2 domain and found in patients could affect its stability, and thus, the target binding capability. The structure also implies that the coiled-coil domain could form antiparallel dimers under high concentrations, possibly when Harmonin underwent liquid-liquid phase separation in the upper tip-link density in hair cell stereocilia or microvilli of enterocytes of the intestinal epithelium. The crystal structure, together with the biochemical analysis, provided mechanistic implications for Harmonin mutations causing Usher syndrome, non-syndromic deafness, or enteropathy."

Breast cancer has become the leading cause of death in women worldwide. Women suffering from breast cancer, as well as survivors, may experience some adverse effects of treatment-including cancer-related fatigue, sleep disorders, and pain-which may manifest alone or in combination with other symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical activity, have been associated with improvements in these adverse effects. This study aims to evaluate the effects of dance therapy in women with breast cancer.We will perform a systematic review according to the Cochrane methodology. An overall search strategy will be developed and adapted for PubMed, Virtual Health Library, PEDro, SciELO, SciVerse Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science using the descriptors ""Dance therapy"" or ""Dancing"" and ""Breast neoplasms"" or ""Breast cancer."" The size of the intervention effect (Z) will be calculated for each outcome included in this review. Outcomes will be pain, cancer-related fatigue, sleep disturbance, body image and depression in women with breast cancer. Quality assessment will be performed using the Cochrane instrument. Metanalysis, if plausible, will be performed using Review Manager 5.3.Studies have reported positive results of dance therapy as a non-pharmacological intervention in women with breast cancer. Thus, it is expected that robust and conclusive evidence of the effects of dance therapy during or after treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and/or surgery) can be obtained.Systematic review registration: CRD42020152876.

https://openalex.org/W4283364363,"Internet use disorder (IUD) is generally conceptualized as a fast-growing behavioral addiction. Several structural and functional brain alterations have been revealed in this condition, but previous behavioral studies indicated that language systems may also be impaired. We used a silent word generation task to induce brain activation in Broca’s area and other parts of the language system. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent activation analysis and psychophysiological interaction analysis were applied to assess functional brain changes. IUD was measured by the Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire and two additional questions concerning usage time and subjective rating of addiction. According to our key findings, areas strongly related to the default mode network were altered in IUD during the task. Moreover, Broca’s area showed altered functional connectivity with other language network and occipital areas in IUD. These findings may address the neural background of decreased verbal fluency performance previously reported in the literature, and we emphasize that beside the brain’s reward and inhibitory control systems, the language system is the next candidate to be involved in the pathogenesis of IUD."

Methods We measured DNA methylation in 645 cord blood samples from participants in the LIMIT study (an antenatal diet and lifestyle intervention for women with early pregnancy BMI ≥25.0 kg/m 2 ) using the Illumina 450K BeadChip array, and tested for any differential methylation related to the intervention, and to maternal early pregnancy BMI. We also analysed differential methylation in relation to selected candidate genes. Results No CpG sites were significantly differentially methylated in relation to either the diet and lifestyle intervention, or with maternal early pregnancy BMI. There was no significant differential methylation in any of the selected genes related to the intervention, or to maternal BMI. Conclusion We found no evidence of an effect of either antenatal diet and lifestyle, or of maternal early pregnancy BMI, on cord blood DNA methylation.

https://openalex.org/W4283446397,"Protein prenylation by farnesyltransferase (FTase) is often described as the targeting of a cysteine-containing motif (CaaX) that is enriched for aliphatic amino acids at the a 1 and a 2 positions, while quite flexible at the X position. Prenylation prediction methods often rely on these features despite emerging evidence that FTase has broader target specificity than previously considered. Using a machine learning approach and training sets based on canonical (prenylated, proteolyzed, and carboxymethylated) and recently identified shunted motifs (prenylation only), this study aims to improve prenylation predictions with the goal of determining the full scope of prenylation potential among the 8000 possible Cxxx sequence combinations. Further, this study aims to subdivide the prenylated sequences as either shunted (i.e., uncleaved) or cleaved (i.e., canonical). Predictions were determined for Saccharomyces cerevisiae FTase and compared to results derived using currently available prenylation prediction methods. In silico predictions were further evaluated using in vivo methods coupled to two yeast reporters, the yeast mating pheromone a -factor and Hsp40 Ydj1p, that represent proteins with canonical and shunted CaaX motifs, respectively. Our machine learning-based approach expands the repertoire of predicted FTase targets and provides a framework for functional classification."

All pGGNs in the two groups (MIA/LPA and NLPA) were randomly divided into training and test cohorts. Forty-seven patients from another center formed the external validation cohort. Baseline features, including clinical data and CT morphological and quantitative parameters, were collected to establish a baseline model. The radiomics model was built with the optimal radiomics features. The combined model was developed using the rad_score and independent baseline predictors. The performance of the models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared using the DeLong test. The differential diagnosis performance of the models was compared with three radiologists (with 20+, 10+, and 3 years of experience) in the test cohort.The radiomics (training AUC: 0.833; test AUC: 0.804; and external validation AUC: 0.792) and combined (AUC: 0.849, 0.820, and 0.775, respectively) models performed better for discriminating than the baseline model (AUC: 0.756, 0.762, and 0.725, respectively) developed by tumor location and mean CT value of the whole nodule. The DeLong test showed that the AUCs of the combined and radiomics models were significantly increased in the training cohort. The highest AUC value of the radiologists was 0.600.The application of CT radiomics improved the identification performance of lung adenocarcinomas with predominant lepidic growth appearing as pGGNs larger than 10 mm."

Human infection is established by intranasal exposure, typically during swimming in warm freshwater bodies, although ritual nasal cleansing (ablution) and the use of medical sinonasal rinsing devices have also been implicated (5Siddiqui R.

The amoebae incite a robust and destructive neutrophilic inflammatory response in the meninges and brain, in contrast to the type IV hypersensitivity response elicited in the brain by other free living amoebae such as Balamuthia or Acanthamoeba (8Baig A.M. Pathogenesis of amoebic encephalitis: are the amoebae being credited to an 'inside job' done by the host immune response?.Acta Trop. 2015; 148: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The resulting devastating brain injury is thought to result primarily from an amplified immune response, rather than direct toxicity or phagocytosis by the parasite, as implied by the misnomer “brain-eating amoeba” (8Baig A.M. Pathogenesis of amoebic encephalitis: are the amoebae being credited to an 'inside job' done by the host immune response?.Acta Trop. 2015; 148: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis progresses rapidly, leading almost invariably to death within ∼5 days (9Zaheer R. Naegleria fowleri–the brain-eating amoeba.J. Pak. Med. Assoc. 2013; 63: 1456PubMed Google Scholar). Symptoms of N. fowleri infection may mimic the more common etiologies of meningitis (bacterial and viral), complicating diagnosis and potentially delaying therapy (9Zaheer R. Naegleria fowleri–the brain-eating amoeba.J. Pak. Med. Assoc. 2013; 63: 1456PubMed Google Scholar, 10Parsonson F. Nicholls C. Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in North Queensland - the diagnostic challenges of Naegleria fowleri.Pathology. 2016; 48 Suppl 1: S105-S106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). A review of confirmed N. fowleri cases revealed a myriad of treatment approaches including combinations of antifungal and antiparasitic drugs that unfortunately lack significant impact on survival (<3% in the US) (2Pugh J.J. Levy R.A. Naegleria fowleri: diagnosis, pathophysiology of brain inflammation, and antimicrobial treatments.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2016; 7: 1178-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Investigation of potential therapeutic targets is therefore critically needed for this rare but nearly universally fatal disease. G protein signaling pathway modulators comprise approximately one-fourth of all currently FDA-approved drugs, with the most frequent targets being the seven-transmembrane G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the top of the pathway (11Williams C. Hill S.J. GPCR signaling: understanding the pathway to successful drug discovery.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 552: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GPCRs are specifically activated by a wide variety of extracellular cues such as hormones, neurotransmitters, chemokines, and photons and activate cytoplasmic heterotrimeric G proteins composed of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits (12Mahoney J.P. Sunahara R.K. Mechanistic insights into GPCR-G protein interactions.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2016; 41: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Receptor-catalyzed exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit induces a conformational change dominated by three mobile switch regions (13Dessauer C.W. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Visualizing signal transduction: receptors, G-proteins, and adenylate cyclases.Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1996; 91: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The activated Gα⋅GTP separates from the Gβγ heterodimer, both of which engage effector proteins and promote second messenger signaling (12Mahoney J.P. Sunahara R.K. Mechanistic insights into GPCR-G protein interactions.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2016; 41: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Signaling is terminated by GTP hydrolysis on the Gα subunit, a reaction accelerated by regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) and leading to the re-formation of the Gαβγ heterotrimer (14Siderovski D.P. Willard F.S. The GAPs, GEFs, and GDIs of heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunits.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2005; 1: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 15Kimple A.J. Bosch D.E. Giguère P.M.

Rev. 2011; 63: 728-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Canonical RGS proteins serve as GTPase-accelerating proteins (GAPs) by stabilizing the switch regions of GTP-bound Gα subunits in the transition state (16Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Structure of RGS4 bound to AlF4–activated G(i alpha1): stabilization of the transition state for GTP hydrolysis.Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Within the animal kingdom, Gα subunits can be classified into four subfamilies: Gαs and Gαi/o subfamilies stimulate and inhibit adenylyl cyclase, respectively; Gαq family members engage phospholipase Cβ isoforms; and the Gα12/13 subfamily activates a family of Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) containing RGS-like domains (RGS-RhoGEFs) (17Wilkie T.M.

The phospholipase C isozymes and their regulation.Subcell Biochem. 2012; 58: 61-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast to the animal kingdom, plant, fungal, and protozoan Gα subunits exhibit greater sequence divergence and, correspondingly, diverse interactions with signaling partners (20Bradford W. Buckholz A. Morton J. Price C. Jones A.M. Urano D. Eukaryotic G protein signaling evolved to require G protein-coupled receptors for activation.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6ra37Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For instance, Saccharomyces cerevisiae GPA1 and Arabidopsis thaliana GPA1 do not engage homologs to mammalian Gα subunit effectors; instead, the Gβγ dimer is thought to play a dominant role promoting downstream signaling in fungi and plants (21Urano D. Chen J.G. Botella J.R. Jones A.M. Heterotrimeric G protein signalling in the plant kingdom.Open Biol. 2013; 3: 120186Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 22Clement S.T. Dixit G. Dohlman H.G.

An additional important difference of many plant Gα subunits such as A. thaliana GPA1 (23Johnston C.A. Taylor J.P. Gao Y. Kimple A.J. Grigston J.C. Chen J.G. et al.GTPase acceleration as the rate-limiting step in Arabidopsis G protein-coupled sugar signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fu Y. Jones A.M. Activation of an unusual G-protein in the simple protist Trichomonas vaginalis.Cell Cycle. 2013; 12: 3127-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) is relatively rapid nucleotide exchange activity in the absence of receptor influence. In these Gα subunits, GTP hydrolysis rather than nucleotide exchange is the rate limiting step of the nucleotide cycle, allowing accumulation of the activated Gα⋅GTP species in the cytoplasm, independent of a GPCR or other GEF, referred to elsewhere as “self-activation” (24Urano D.

Plant Gα subunits are known to engage seven-transmembrane RGS proteins (7TM RGS) that accelerate the rate-limiting GTP hydrolysis step, likely with modulation by extracellular cues, as exemplified by the glucose-responsive A. thaliana 7TM RGS protein AtRGS1 (23Johnston C.A. Taylor J.P. Gao Y. Kimple A.J. Grigston J.C. Chen J.G. et al.GTPase acceleration as the rate-limiting step in Arabidopsis G protein-coupled sugar signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bennetzen J.L. et al.G protein activation without a GEF in the plant kingdom.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8e1002756Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Other protozoan Gα subunits exhibit the typical nucleotide cycle pattern of rate-limiting nucleotide exchange and thus presumably require activation by a GEF such as a GPCR (27Bosch D.E. Siderovski D.P. G protein signaling in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica.Exp. Mol. Med. 2013; 45e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One such Gα subunit from the enteric pathogen Entamoeba histolytica, EhGα1, engages the Gα effector EhRGS-RhoGEF, leading to Rho family GTPase activation and modulation of pathogenic behaviors such as migration, extracellular matrix invasion, and host cell killing (28Bosch D.E.

The presence of transcribed arrestin-like genes supports the hypothesis of at least one functional GPCR protein in N. fowleri, given that the encoded arrestin-like proteins are predicted to have roles in GPCR desensitization, internalization, and recycling (38Reiter E.

A number of the 7TM RGS proteins in N. fowleri harbor GPCR proteolytic site motifs (Fig. 1), reminiscent of the adhesion GPCRs that are activated via cell–cell or cell–matrix contact (43Prömel S.

Consistent with this suggested function, several Nf 7TM RGS proteins have complex extracellular N termini with predicted epidermal growth factor–like repeats and lectin domains (e.g., Nf 7TM RGS2, Nf 7TM RGS3, and Nf 7TM RGS4; Fig. 1). In addition to 7TM RGS proteins, the N. fowleri genome encodes a large RGS protein family, with 79 additional RGS domain-containing proteins (beyond the 7TM RGS protein class) and a single RGS-RhoGEF protein with a multidomain structure (Fig. 1) similar to the Gα effector in E. histolytica, EhRGS-RhoGEF (27Bosch D.E.

Three phospholipase C (PLC) genes are present within the N. fowleri genome, although none encodes sufficient protein sequence similarity with mammalian PLCs to allow subclassification, such as among the PLCβ isozymes that are Gαq effectors in mammals (19Gresset A.

Relatively simplified PLC domain structures with catalytic X-box and Y-box domains, and EF hands suggest calcium regulation (Fig. 1). A remarkably large family of 80 putative adenylyl/guanylyl cyclase proteins containing a catalytic CYCc domain are present in the N. fowleri genome (Fig. 1), 62 of which are apparently simultaneously expressed in trophozoites by RNAseq (FPKM > 20th percentile) (32Zysset-Burri D.C.

These putative cyclic nucleotide-forming enzymes exhibit diverse topologies and domain combinations, including predicted cytoplasmic proteins (e.g., Nf AC5) and proteins with variable predicted transmembrane helices (Fig. 1). Gα subunits are signaling hubs with distinct downstream effectors that can be predicted in mammals and higher eukaryotes based on sequence similarity (17Wilkie T.M. Yokoyama S. Evolution of the G protein alpha subunit multigene family.Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1994; 49: 249-270PubMed Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of the Gα subunits encoded within the N. fowleri genome, as compared to Gα MSAs from humans and select model organisms (Fig. S1). Clear phylogenetic relationships were apparent among subfamilies of Gα subunits from humans, Dictyostelium rerio, Dictyostelium melanogaster, and C. elegans; in contrast, those from protists such as N. fowleri, D. discoideum, T. vaginalis, and E. histolytica, from fungi such as S. cerevisiae, and from the plants A. thaliana and O. sativa are more distantly related.

To examine the functionality and nucleotide cycling characteristics of Gα subunits in N. fowleri, six family members were produced as recombinant proteins from Entamoeba coli (Fig. S2). Conformational change upon activation of many Gα subunits can be detected as changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, primarily effected by a tryptophan on switch 2 (44Higashijima T.

When purified from E. coli, five N. fowleri Gα subunits exhibited the expected increase in tryptophan fluorescence upon nucleotide activation (Fig. 2). Three of these Gα subunits (Nf Gα1–3) exhibited typical activation upon binding to the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GppNHp (Fig. 2, A–C), while GTP was insufficient for detectable activation, consistent with nucleotide exchange being the rate limiting step in the nucleotide cycle. Observed kinetics of activation for Nf Gα1–3 ranged over an approximate order of magnitude (∼0.03–0.3 min−1; Fig. 2, D–F). In contrast, Nf Gα5 and Nf Gα7 each achieved the active conformation in the presence of either GppNHp or GTP (Fig. 2, G and I), consistent with “self-activation” and GTP hydrolysis being the rate limiting step of nucleotide cycling. As observed for other Gα subunits with rapid nucleotide exchange (e.g., ref. (24Urano D. Jones J.C. Wang H. Matthews M. Bradford W.

Nf Gα5 and Nf Gα7 also exhibit significantly more rapid activation kinetics (0.7 and 1.3 min−1) as compared to other Nf Gα subunits tested (Fig. 2, J and L). Nf Gα6 did not display a significant change in tryptophan fluorescence upon addition of either GTP or GppNHp (Fig. 2H). However, activation was achieved"

To this end, improving health literacy of the community is critical. However, there is limited evidence about the health literacy of Ethiopians, especially among those who visit health facilities. Objective The aim of this study was to examine awareness of diagnosis, treatment plan and prognosis among patients at the time of their exit from public hospitals and health centers. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 627 patients in two public hospitals and selected health centers in Addis Ababa, using a systematic random sampling technique from inpatient and outpatient departments (OPD). A total of 579 study participants had complete data and were included in this analysis. A structured, pre-tested and interview-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. We used proportions to describe the findings and logistic regression analyses to assess factors associated with awareness of diagnosis, treatment plan and prognosis. Result About three-fifths (61.9%) and 52.8% of the study participants knew correctly their diagnosis and treatment plan respectively. More than two-thirds, 68.4%, said that they knew about the prognosis of their illness. However, only 21 (3.6%) patient medical records had information on prognosis. Gynecologic patients had significantly lower awareness about their diagnosis and treatment plan as compared to those from a general outpatient department. Emergency patients had significantly lower awareness of their treatment plan (OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.11,0.68) and prognosis (OR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.09,0.50) than new OPD patients. Patients who indicated they had a good experience at their clinical assessment had significantly lower awareness of their prognosis (OR = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.81). Conclusion A significant proportion of patients didn’t know their correct diagnosis, treatment plan and prognosis. This was more pronounced among gynecologic and emergency patients. More efforts are needed to strengthen patient-provider interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4283382980,"Nephrin is a type-1 transmembrane protein and a component of the slit diaphragm renal-filtration barrier. It has several functions in actin remodeling and cell–cell adhesion. Nephrin is principally located in the kidney glomerulus, but several studies have reported that nephrin is found in the pancreas, brain, and placenta. However, nephrin expression and its role in human skin have not yet been reported. First, using single-cell RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and immuno-electron microscopy, nephrin expression was confirmed in human-skin epidermal keratinocytes. Nephrin expression colocalized with the expression of zonula occludens-1 in keratinocytes and was closely related to keratinocyte cell density, proliferation, and migration. High glucose treatment decreased nephrin expression and compromised keratinocyte cell migration without yes-associated protein nuclear entry. This reduced cell migration under high glucose conditions was improved in nephrin-overexpressing keratinocytes. Nephrin was highly expressed on the margins of re-epithelized epidermis based on in vivo mice and ex vivo human skin wound models. The results demonstrate that nephrin is expressed in human-skin keratinocytes and functions in cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration. In conclusion, this study suggests that nephrin may have a variety of physiological roles in human skin."

Time-motion, individual and tactical-related variables were monitored when manipulating conditions with different number of teammates and opponents (11vs11, No-Sup, No-Inf; 11vs12, Low-Sup, Low-Inf; 11vs13, Mod-Sup, Mod-Inf; and 11vs14, High-Sup, High-Inf). Results showed that adding teammates promoted increases in the longitudinal synchronization from No-Sup to Mod-Sup (Cohen's d with 95% of confidence intervals: 0.25 [0.12; 0.39]; p < .001) and High-Sup (0.61 [0.41; 0.82]; p < .001), while decreases in the distance to the nearest teammate, both in the offensive and defensive phases (p < .001 and p = .005, respectively). In addition, it was observed lower distance covered while running when playing in High-Sup compared to No-Sup (0.30 [-0.01; 0.61]; p = .002) during the defensive phase. Attacking in numerical inferiority promoted a higher variability in the distance to the nearest teammate from No-Inf to High-Inf (0.83 [0.27; 1.38]; p = .044), while decreasing the physical demands, specifically distance covered while running (-0.49 [-0.99; 0.01]; p = .039). In turn, defending, mainly in high-inferiority, increased the total distance covered compared to No-Inf (0.61 [0.30; 0.91]; p < .001) and led to a decrease in the distance to the nearest teammate (-0.90 [-1.35; -0.44]; p = .002). Overall, coaches may manipulate the number of teammates and opponents to promote distinct effects at the level of cooperation and opposition dynamical interactions."

Methods A dynamic state transition model was adopted to simulate life time, direct medical costs and QALYs. In the base case scenario, for patients with unresectable, stage Ⅲ non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy, the treatment group would use durvalumab whereas the control group would use BSC. Clinical data and health utility were derived from the patient-level data of Asian ethnicity in the PACIFIC trial. Cost of drug acquisition, follow-up, medical service, inspection, terminal care and adverse event treatment were considered in this model. The cost of durvalumab was calculated based on retail prices and Patient Assistance Program. Results In the base case, the durvalumab group yielded an additional 2.60 LYs and 2.37QALYs (discounted), causing an additional cost of 0.459 million RMB and 0.109 million RMB without and with PAP, so the ICER was 193,898 RMB/QALY and 46,093.12 RMB/QALY respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrated that durvalumab can improve the survival of patients with unresectable, stage Ⅲ non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy and would be a cost-effective option compared with BSC at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 212676 RMB (three times GDP per capita of China in 2019)."

In this study, we inspect 2729 publicly available ancient genomes (100 BP-52000 BP) for the presence of pathogenic variants in 32643 disease-associated loci. We base our subsequent analyses on 19 variants in seven genes-PAH, EDAR, F11, HBB, LRRK2, SLC12A6 and MAOA, associated with monogenic diseases and with well-established pathogenic impact in contemporary populations. We determine 230 homozygote genotypes of these variants in the screened 2729 ancient DNA samples. Eleven of these are in the PAH gene (126 ancient samples in total), a gene associated with the condition phenylketonuria in modern populations. The variants examined seem to show varying dynamics over the last 10000 years, some exhibiting a single upsurge in frequency and subsequently disappearing, while others maintain high frequency levels (compared to contemporary population frequencies) over long time periods. The geographic distribution and age of the ancient DNA samples with established pathogenic variants suggests multiple independent origin of these variants. Comparison of estimates of the geographic prevalence of these variants from ancient and contemporary data show discontinuity in their prevalence and supports their recurrent emergence. The oldest samples in which a variant is established might give an indication of their age and place origin, and an EDAR gene pathogenic variant was established in a sample estimated to be 33210-32480 calBCE. Knowledge about the historical prevalence of variants causing monogenic disorders provides insight on their emergence, dynamics and spread."

Myeloid cells which compose of a significant proportion of the inflammatory cells infiltrate to the to a wound site where they play important roles in clearance of damaged tissue and microorganisms. Myeloid cells have the capacity to be converted into fibroblast-like cells and endothelial cells during wound healing process. However, whether myeloid cells in wounds can convert into epithelial cells where they contribute to healing process is not clear. In this study, we performed double immunofluorescent staining with antibodies for hematopoietic cells and keratinocytes as well as cell tracing technique to investigate hematopoietic cell conversion. The result showed that during the healing process, some of the CD45-positive hematopoietic cells also expressed keratin 14, a marker for keratinocytes. Further, double immunofluorescent staining in dermal wounds, using CD11b and K14 antibodies indicated that CD11b-positive myeloid cells were the origin of newly generated epithelial cells. Through tracing injected labeled splenocyte-derived myeloid cells in skin, we confirmed that myeloid cells were able to convert into keratinocytes in repaired skin. Furthermore, our results from in vivo experiments provided new information on contribution of myeloid cells in hair follicle regeneration. In conclusion, this work highlights the myeloid cell contributions in wound repair and hair follicle regeneration through conversion of M-CSF-stimulated CD11b-positive myeloid cells into epithelial cells in a murine model."

Thus, this study aims to compare the effect of a protocol of general exercises versus a program of motor control training on pain at baseline and after treatment in women with greater trochanteric pain syndrome.The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CAAE: 87372318.1.0000.5406) and has been prospectively registered on the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-37gw2x). Sixty participants will be randomized to receive motor control exercises or general exercises. The application will be performed twice a week for 8 weeks. The participants will be evaluated before the treatment (T0), after 8 weeks of intervention (T8) and after 60 weeks of intervention (T60). The primary outcome measures will be the hip pain intensity, and secondary outcomes will be muscle strength, kinesiophobia, global perceived effect, pain catastrophization, central sensitization and quality of life.Studies have suggested that greater trochanteric pain syndrome may be related to poor hip and pelvic control, however, no study has investigated an exercise protocol focused on increasing the strength of the abductor and extensor muscles of the hip associated with pelvic control training, especially in positions of unilateral support, such as gait.

Mental health of youth is rooted in their social environment. Helping others or engaging in prosocial behavior are activities that youth may participate in. The notion of helping others and its association with individual mental well-being have been well-studied for adults and older adults and to some extent in youth, however, no review has been conducted to understand the intersection of helping others and mental health in the youth population. Methods This review will consider all study designs that examine helping others and mental health of youth. The inclusion criteria for the review will include young individuals aged 10-24-year-old, living in any geographic location, of all gender identities, and with or without mental health issues. Grey literature and studies that only speak to outcomes related to physical well-being will be excluded. A search will be conducted in CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Studies published in the English language will be included with no restriction on publication time period. Articles will be screened against the inclusion criteria onto a single software by two independent reviewers. In the case of any disagreement, a third independent reviewer would resolve the conflict. Findings Data will be extracted and presented in a tabular or diagrammatic form supported by a summary. We will report our findings in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR).

Today, with widespread varicella vaccination coverage, an estimated 3.5 million cases of varicella, 9,000 hospitalizations, and 100 deaths are prevented annually in the United States. Since varicella infections are now uncommon, health care providers (HCPs) may not recognize varicella infections and may prescribe inappropriate treatment.An online survey of HCPs was conducted to assess recognition and management of varicella infections. Responses to eight varicella vignettes describing patients with varying varicella symptoms were analyzed and descriptive analyses performed. Stratified analysis comparing responses of those licensed before and in/after 1996 was also performed.153 HCPs (50 nurse practitioners, 103 doctors) completed the survey. Mean age of respondents was 44 years. 62% were female, and 82% were licensed before 1996. Varicella infection was correctly diagnosed 79% of the time. HCPs correctly recognized uncomplicated varicella vignettes 85% of the time versus 61% of the time for complicated varicella vignettes. Antibiotics were recommended 17% of the time and antivirals 18% of the time, of which 25% and 69% (respectively) were not appropriate per guidelines. HCPs licensed before 1996 were better able to recognize varicella compared to those licensed later, but prescribed more antimicrobials medications to treat varicella.Although most HCPs recognized varicella infection, a sizable proportion could not recognize cases with complications, and some of the varicella cases were inappropriately treated with antibiotics and/or antivirals. Additional HCP training and high vaccination coverage are important strategies to avoid inaccurate diagnoses and minimize unnecessary exposure to antimicrobial/antiviral therapies."

Arm cycling has been proposed as a potential method for achieving this although dosage parameters and evidence is limited. The aim of this study was to conduct a pilot study evaluating the effect of a single intermittent arm cycling exercise programme on people affected by FSHD. People with confirmed genetic diagnosis of FSHD between the ages 18–60 years were recruited to attend a single session for the exercise intervention (5 exercise efforts lasting 2 minutes each with 30 seconds of rest between each effort). Prior to exercise, measures of shoulder function (Oxford shoulder score), strength and range of movement were recorded. During the exercise participants were video recorded to quantify range of movement and extract movement profile features. Participants comments were recorded and followed up four days later to check for adverse events. Fifteen participants, (6F:9M) were recruited with median (IQR) Oxford Shoulder Scores of 25 (18 to 39). All participants successfully completed the exercise intervention with only transient symptoms consistent with exercise being reported and achieving a median (IQR) rate of perceived exertion scores of 13 (12 to 13). Movement profile data was available for 12 out of 15 participants and suggests that exercise intensity did not compromise movement. An association between strength and shoulder function (R 2 = 0.5147), Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) of the final effort against shoulder function and strength (R 2 = 0.2344 and 0.1743 respectively) was identified. Participant comments were positive regarding the exercise intervention. Our study demonstrates that an intermittent arm cycling programme is feasible for people affected by FSHD. Further work is needed to evaluate physiological responses to exercise across variations in programme variables and equipment set up in a larger sample of people affected by FSHD."

The mean income point is implied by an income density function and associated with a single-parametric Lorenz function. The boundary of the mean income point can show the flexibility of a parametric Lorenz function. I minimize the sum of squared errors in fitting both grouped income data and the mean income point and identify the best parametric Lorenz function using a large panel dataset. I find that each parametric Lorenz function may do a better job than others in fitting particular grouped data; however, a zero- and unit-modal single-parametric Lorenz function is identified to be the best of eight typical optional functions in fitting most (666 out of 969) observations of a large panel dataset. I perform a Monte Carlo simulation as a robustness check of the empirical estimation."
https://openalex.org/W4283447566,"Uterus transplantation is a complex surgical procedure. Uterine ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury that occurs during this process may cause a loss of function of the uterus and the failure of transplantation. Resveratrol (RSV) is a naturally occurring polyphenol found abundantly in the skin of grapes and red wine, and it has also been used as a dietary supplement in clinical practice. RSV possesses strong anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, and exhibits a role in immune system regulation. However, the role of RSV in protecting the uterus against I/R-induced injury is yet to be fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms underlying RSV in I/R-induced uterus injury. A total of 48 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control (sham operation) group, the uterus I/R group, the 20 mg/kg RSV-pre-treated I/R (I/R+RSV/20) group and the 40 mg/kg RSV-pre-treated I/R (I/R+ RSV/40) group. A regular I/R model was established to induce uterus injury in rats. RSV at 20 or 40 mg/kg was intraperitoneally administrated into rats in both I/R+ RSV groups once per day for five consecutive days prior to ischemia. The control and I/R only groups received an intraperitoneal injection of the vehicle (ethanol) for the same period prior to ischemia. Samples from blood and uterine horns were collected 3 h after reperfusion. Changes in the levels of malondialdehyde, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-10 and IL-37 were determined using ELISA, the activity levels of myeloperoxidase, catalase, and superoxidase dismutase were also determined using ELISA, the protein expression levels of PI3K, phosphorylated (p)-PI3K, AKT and p-AKT were determined using western blot analysis, and the uterine histology was investigated using H&E staining. Results of the present study demonstrated that treatment with RSV increased the capacity of antioxidants and suppressed uterine oxidative injury induced by I/R. Moreover, treatment with RSV decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, RSV promoted the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, thus activating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, administration of RSV prior to uterine I/R effectively alleviated inflammatory response and oxidative stress via activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, suggesting that RSV may play a protective role in I/R-induced uterus injury."

We assessed participants' satisfaction and preferences for the Power to Quit (PTQ) program.PTQ was a 26-week community-based smoking-cessation RCT among people experiencing homelessness. A total of 315 of the 430 enrolled participants completed the 26 week-study feedback survey. Overall program satisfaction was measured on a 5-point Likert scale by asking the question ""Overall, how satisfied were you with the Power to Quit Program?"" Analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with overall program satisfaction.Participants were mostly male (74.9%), African American (59.0%), 40 years and older (78.2%), and not married or living with a partner (94.9%). Visa gift cards were the most preferred incentive followed by bus tokens and Subway restaurant coupons. The patch and counseling were the top-ranked intervention component, 55.3% rated the patch as very helpful; 59.4% felt counseling sessions was very helpful; 48.6% found reminder phone calls or messages most helpful for appointment reminders. Majority (78.7%) said they were very satisfied overall, 80.0% were very satisfied with the program schedule, and 85.4% were very satisfied with program staff. Race and age at smoking initiation were predictors of overall program satisfaction. African American/Black participants were 1.9 times more likely to be satisfied with the program compared to White participants.Majority of the participants of PTQ were satisfied with the program. This study supports the acceptability of a smoking cessation program implemented in a population experiencing homelessness. The high rate of satisfaction among African American participants may be in part because of race concordance between participants, study staff, and community advisory board. Including staff that have a shared lived experience with participants in a smoking cessation study may improve the participant satisfaction within such studies."

A cross sectional study based on the baseline data of the Malaysian Elder Mistreatment Project (MAESTRO) collected from November 2013 until July 2014 involving 1927 older adults in Kuala Pilah, Negeri Sembilan was conducted. EAN was determined using the modified Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) and hospitalization rates were determined based on self-report. The prevalence of overall EAN was 8.1% (95%CI 6.9–9.3). Among male respondents, 9.5% revealed history of abuse and among female respondents, 7.2% reported experiencing EAN. The annual hospitalization rates per 100 persons within the past one year among EAN victims and non-victims were 18 per 100 persons (SD = 46.1) and 15 per 100 persons (SD = 64.1) respectively. Among respondents with history of EAN, 16.0% (n = 21) had been hospitalized in the past 12 months while among respondents with no EAN experience, 10.2% (n = 153) were hospitalized. Multivariable analyses using Poisson regression did not show any significant association between EAN and hospitalization. This could be due to the complex interactions between medical and social circumstances that play a role in hospital admissions, factors affecting the health care system, and access to health care among EAN victims."

We find that incorporating social data into various machine learning algorithms substantially improves the algorithms' ability to correctly determine these transitions in the NBA but only marginally in MLB. We also measure the extent to which player performance and team fitness data can be used to predict transitions between teams. This data, however, only slightly improves our predictions for players for both basketball and baseball players. We also consider whether social, performance, and team fitness data can be used to infer past transitions. Here we find that social data significantly improves our inference accuracy in both the NBA and MLB but player performance and team fitness data again does little to improve this score."
