https://openalex.org/W2055770867,"CpG island hypermethylation occurs in most cases of cancer, typically resulting in the transcriptional silencing of critical cancer genes. Procainamide has been shown to inhibit DNA methyltransferase activity and reactivate silenced gene expression in cancer cells by reversing CpG island hypermethylation. We report here that procainamide specifically inhibits the hemimethylase activity of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the mammalian enzyme thought to be responsible for maintaining DNA methylation patterns during replication. At micromolar concentrations, procainamide was found to be a partial competitive inhibitor of DNMT1, reducing the affinity of the enzyme for its two substrates, hemimethylated DNA and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-l-methionine. By doing so, procainamide significantly decreased the processivity of DNMT1 on hemimethylated DNA. Procainamide was not a potent inhibitor of the <i>de novo</i> methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b2. As further evidence of the specificity of procainamide for DNMT1, procainamide failed to lower genomic 5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine levels in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells when <i>DNMT1</i> was genetically deleted but significantly reduced genomic 5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine content in parental HCT116 cells and in HCT116 cells where <i>DNMT3b</i> was genetically deleted. Because many reports have strongly linked DNMT1 with epigenetic alterations in carcinogenesis, procainamide may be a useful drug in the prevention of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2171040892,"Tracking the distribution of stem cells is crucial to their therapeutic use. However, the usage of current vectors in cellular labeling is restricted by their low internalizing efficiency. Here, we reported a cellular labeling approach with a novel vector composed of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and 3T3-L1 cells, and the mechanism about fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated MSNs (FITC-MSNs) internalization was studied. FITC-MSNs were efficiently internalized into mesenchymal stem cells and 3T3-L1 cells even in short-term incubation. The process displayed a time- and concentration-dependent manner and was dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, clathrin-dependent endocytosis seemed to play a decisive role on more internalization and longer stay of FITC-MSNs in mesenchymal stem cells than in 3T3-L1 cells. The internalization of FITC-MSNs did not affect the cell viability, proliferation, immunophenotype, and differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells, and 3T3-L1 cells. Finally, FITC-MSNs could escape from endolysosomal vesicles and were retained the architectonic integrity after internalization. We conclude that the advantages of biocompatibility, durability, and higher efficiency in internalization suit MSNs to be a better vector for stem cell tracking than others currently used."

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, orthologs of Tip49a and Tip49b, called Rvb1 and Rvb2, respectively, are subunits of two distinct ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, SWR1 and INO80. We recently demonstrated that the mammalian Tip49a and Tip49b proteins are integral subunits of a chromatin remodeling complex bearing striking similarities to the S. cerevisiae SWR1 complex (Cai, Y., Jin, J., Florens, L., Swanson, S.

In this report, we identify a new mammalian Tip49a- and Tip49b-containing ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, which includes orthologs of 8 of the 15 subunits of the S. cerevisiae INO80 chromatin remodeling complex as well as at least five additional subunits unique to the human INO80 (hINO80) complex. Finally, we demonstrate that, similar to the yeast INO80 complex, the hINO80 complex exhibits DNA- and nucleosome-activated ATPase activity and catalyzes ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding.

Finally, we demonstrate that, similar to the yeast INO80 complex, the hINO80 complex exhibits DNA- and nucleosome-activated ATPase activity and catalyzes ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding. The related mammalian Tip49a and Tip49b proteins are members of a family of AAA+ (associated with various cellular activities) ATPases with roles in DNA repair, recombination, and transcriptional regulation (1Neuwald A.F.

Thus, the SWR1 and INO80 complexes share three proteins (Tip49a, Tip49b, and Arp4) and contain additional homologous components. In addition, each of the two complexes has a number of unique subunits. The orthologs of the Tip49a and Tip49b AAA+ ATPases also play roles in chromatin remodeling in higher eukaryotes.

In addition to Tip49a and Tip49b, the TRRAP-TIP60 complex includes ATM/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family member TRRAP, the SNF2 family p400 or Domino helicase, actin-related protein Arp4, bromodomain-containing protein BRD8, the enhancer of polycomb (EPC) and/or enhancer of polycomb-like (EPC-like) protein, inhibitor of growth 3 (ING3), DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein (DMAP1), MRG15 and/or the related MRGX protein, the MRGBP protein, and TIP60, a HAT belonging to the MYST family. Characterization of the activities associated with the higher eukaryotic TRRAP-TIP60 complex revealed that it possesses HAT activity similar to that of the S. cerevisiae NuA4 HAT complex, which acetylates histones H2A and H4 (reviewed in Ref. 18Doyon Y.

We recently identified a new mammalian Tip49a- and Tip49b-containing ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that bears striking similarity to the S. cerevisiae SWR1 complex (19Cai Y. Jin J. Florence L. Swanson S.K. Kusch T. Li B. Workman J.L. Washburn M.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13665-13670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Purification of this complex revealed that it includes the SNF2 family and SWR1-related SRCAP helicase, as well as orthologs of most of the known subunits of the S. cerevisiae SWR1 complex. In the course of our characterization of the structure and function of the SRCAP complex, we identified an additional mammalian Tip49a- and Tip49b-containing chromatin remodeling complex. Here we describe the properties of this new chromatin remodeling complex, which includes orthologs of 8 of the 15 subunits of the S. cerevisiae INO80 chromatin remodeling complex as well as at least 5 additional subunits unique to the human INO80 (hINO80) complex. Generation and Growth of Mammalian Cell Lines—Full-length cDNAs encoding the human Tip49a, Tip49b, Arp8, PAPA-1 (hIes2), C18orf37 (hIes6), Amida, and FLJ90652 proteins or a fragment of FLJ20309 (residues 106–544) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, subcloned with FLAG tags into pcDNA5/FRT, and introduced into HEK293/FRT cells using the Invitrogen Flp-in system. Full-length cDNAs encoding the human PAPA-1 and C18orf37 proteins were subcloned with FLAG tags into pcDNA3.1 and introduced into HeLa S3 cells. Parental and stably transformed HEK293/FRT and HeLa S3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum. For large scale cultures, HeLa cells were grown in spinner culture in Joklik medium with 5% calf serum. Anti-FLAG Agarose Chromatography—Whole cell extracts were prepared from HEK293/FRT cells as follows. Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in four to five 15-cm dishes. Cells were washed in dishes with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by resuspension in buffer (1 ml/dish) containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.45 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Triton X-100. The resulting suspension was transferred to centrifuge tubes and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C in a 70.1 Ti rotor (Beckman-Coulter). The resulting supernatant was subjected to anti-FLAG agarose chromatography. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa S3 cells according to the method of Dignam et al. (20Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Whole cell or nuclear extracts were adjusted to 0.3 m NaCl and 0.2% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Ti-45 rotor. Supernatants were then mixed with anti-FLAG (M2) agarose beads (Sigma) in a ratio of 100 μl of packed beads/6 ml of supernatant and gently rocked for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with a 50-fold excess of buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.25 m NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol and once with the same buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl. Proteins were eluted from the beads twice by incubation for 30 min on a rotator at 4 °C with 100 μl of 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). Glycerol was omitted from the elution buffer for samples to be analyzed by mass spectrometry. ATPase Assays—Reaction mixtures of 20 μl contained 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 70 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 μm ATP, 0.2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (400 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). Where indicated, reaction mixtures contained the hINO80 complex purified from HeLa cells expressing FLAG-hIes2 (PAPA-1) and 150 ng of mononucleosomes or long oligonucleosomes prepared from HeLa cells as described (21Owen-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Steger D.J. West J.M. John S. Cote J. Havas K.M. Workman J.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 319-331PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). A 2-μl aliquot of each reaction mixture was spotted onto a cellulose polyethyleneimine TLC plate (JT Baker). The plate was then developed with 0.375 m potassium phosphate (pH 3.5). Reaction products were detected and quantitated using a Typhoon phosphorimaging device (GE Healthcare). Nucleosome Remodeling Assays—A 216-bp DNA fragment (dSH-A) was generated by PCR from pGUB-dSH in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. pGUB-dSH was generated by deleting the SalI to HindIII fragment of pGUB (22Juan L.J. Utley R.T. Vignali M. Bohm L. Workman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3635-3640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mononucleosomes were reconstituted on this labeled DNA fragment by dilution transfer from HeLa long oligonucleosomes. ∼3 μg of nucleosomes was mixed with ∼1 pmol of 32P-labeled DNA fragment in 25 μl of buffer containing 1.0 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. After 30 min at 30 °C, the mixture was sequentially adjusted to 0.8, 0.6, and 0.4 m NaCl by dilution with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm dithiothreitol, with a 30-min incubation at 30 °C between each dilution. Final dilutions to 0.2 and 0.1 m NaCl were made using the same buffer plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After reconstitution, the mononucleosomes were stored in 30-μl aliquots at -20 °C. hINO80 complex purified from HeLa cells expressing FLAG-PAPA-1 (hIes2) was incubated at 37 °C with 2.5 μl of reconstituted mononucleosomes (∼0.01 pmol of labeled mononucleosome, ∼0.25 pmol of unlabeled oligonucleosomes) in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 45 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm ATP. After a 30-min incubation, 0.5 μg of HeLa cell long oligonucleosomes (21Owen-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Steger D.J. West J.M. John S. Cote J. Havas K.M. Workman J.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 319-331PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.75 μg of salmon sperm DNA (which had been sonicated, boiled, and quick-chilled) were added, and reactions were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C to remove DNA- or nucleosome-binding proteins that would alter mononucleosome electrophoretic mobility. The reaction products were then applied to 5% polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. 1989; : B.23Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoresis at 4 °C for 4.5 h at 200 V. Gels were dried and exposed to a storage phosphor screen overnight. Mass Spectrometry—Identification of proteins was accomplished as described (19Cai Y. Jin J. Florence L. Swanson S.K. Kusch T. Li B.

(24Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates J.R. II I Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar). Briefly, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were reduced, alkylated, and digested with modified trypsin (Roche Applied Science). Peptide mixtures were applied to a three-phase microcapillary HPLC column (25McDonald W.H. Ohi R. Miyamoto D.T. Mitchison T.J. Yates J.R. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 219: 245-251Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar) packed with 5 μm C18 reverse phase resin (Aqua, Phenomenex), followed by strong cation exchange resin (Partisphere SCX, Whatman) and then by 5 μm C18 reverse phase resin (Aqua, Phenomenex), and equilibrated in 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (Buffer A). Peptides were sequentially eluted from the SCX resin to the reverse phase resin with six steps of increasing salt concentration. After each step, peptides were eluted from the reverse phase resin with a gradient of acetonitrile into a Deca-XP ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-liquid chromatography electrospray ionization source (ThermoFinnigan). The program 2-3 (26Sadygov R.G. Eng J. Durr E. Saraf A. McDonald H. MacCoss M.J. Yates J.R. II I J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was used to determine the charge state and to delete poor quality spectra. The SEQUEST algorithm (27Eng J.K. McCormick A.L. Yates J.R. II I J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5471) Google Scholar) was used to match tandem mass spectrometry spectra to human peptides extracted from the NCBI NR data base (27Eng J.K. McCormick A.L. Yates J.R. II I J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5471) Google Scholar,196 human protein sequences as of March 24, 2004). Spectra/peptide matches were only retained if they had a normalized difference in cross-correlation scores of at least 0.08 and a minimum cross-correlation score of 1.8 for +1, 2.5 for +2, and 3.5 for +3 spectra and if the peptides were at least 7 amino acids long. Human Tip49a and Tip49b Are Associated with a Human INO80-like Protein (hINO80)—As part of our characterization of the structures and functions of mammalian TRRAP-TIP60 and SRCAP chromatin remodeling complexes, we generated cell lines stably expressing either Tip49a or Tip49b with N-terminal FLAG epitope tags and then purified Tip49a- and Tip49b-associating proteins by anti-FLAG agarose immunoaffinity chromatography. As a control for the specificity of immunoaffinity purifications, extracts prepared from untransformed, parental cells were subjected to the same procedure. As shown in Fig. 1, anti-FLAG agarose eluates from FLAG-Tip49a- and FLAG-Tip49b-expressing cells appeared to include similar sets of proteins (compare lanes 1 and 2). To identify and compare FLAG-Tip49a- and FLAG-Tip49b-associating proteins, we took advantage of MudPIT (24Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates J.R. II I Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar, 28Wolters D. Washburn M.P. Yates J.R. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar), a sensitive method for identifying proteins present in complex mixtures. In a Mud-PIT experiment, a mixture of proteins is first digested into peptides, which are then fractionated by two-dimensional strong cation exchange and reverse phase HPLC and analyzed by in-line tandem mass spectrometry. As summarized in Fig. 2, MudPIT analyses of anti-FLAG agarose eluates from FLAG-Tip49a- and FLAG-Tip49b-expressing cells identified, in addition to the known subunits of the TRRAP-TIP60 and SRCAP complexes, a collection of proteins not previously found in either TRRAP-TIP60 or SRCAP preparations or in MudPIT control samples. Among these proteins was a previously uncharacterized SNF2 family helicase encoded by the KIAA1259 ORF. As suggested by analysis of symmetrical best matches in data base searches and by phylogenetic inference, the 1561-amino acid KIAA1259 protein is an apparent human ortholog of the S. cerevisiae Ino80 helicase (29Bakshi R. Prakash T. Dash D. Brahmachari V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 4A. Mushegian, unpublished observations. Also among these proteins were the actin-related proteins Arp5 and Arp8, each of which has a yeast ortholog found in the INO80 complex but not in the SWR1 complex (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). Subunit Composition of the hINO80 Complex—To investigate the possibility that some or all of these proteins were subunits of a mammalian INO80 complex, we generated an HEK293/FRT cell line stably expressing Arp8 with an N-terminal FLAG tag. Extracts prepared from these cells were subjected to anti-FLAG agarose chromatography, and proteins present in anti-FLAG agarose eluates were identified by Mud-PIT. As shown in Fig. 2, Arp8 copurified with hIno80, Tip49a and Tip49b, Baf53a (Arp4), Arp5, and an additional seven proteins that were not present in either the TRRAP-TIP60 or SRCAP complexes. These proteins included the “Pim-1 kinase-associated protein-associated protein 1” (PAPA-1, GI 13775202) (30Kuroda T.S. Maita H. Tabata T. Taira T. Kitaura H. Ariga H. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.

To determine whether these proteins were present in the same complex, we generated additional HeLa and HEK293/FRT cell lines stably expressing full-length PAPA-1, C18orf37, Amida, or FLJ90652, all with N-terminal FLAG tags, or a C-terminally FLAG-tagged fragment of FLJ20309 (residues 106–544). As shown in Fig. 1 (compare lanes 4 and 5), anti-FLAG agarose eluates prepared from FLAG-PAPA-1 expressing HeLa cells and from FLAG-FLJ90652 expressing HEK293/FRT cells appeared to include similar sets of proteins. Furthermore, MudPIT analyses revealed that FLAG-tagged PAPA-1, C18orf37, Amida, FLJ20309, and FLJ90652 each copurified with the hINO80 helicase and the Tip49a, Tip49b, PAPA-1, C18orf37, Arp4, Arp5, Arp8, Amida, NFRKB, MCRS1, FLJ90652, and FLJ20309 proteins, which argues that they are all components of a multiprotein hINO80-containing complex (Fig. 2). Notably, unique subunits of the TRRAP-TIP60 or SRCAP complexes were not detected by MudPIT in any of these purified samples (Fig. 2). Sequence analysis suggests that several of these hINO80-associated proteins are previously unrecognized orthologs of subunits of the yeast INO80 complex. PAPA-1 is orthologous to the Ies2 subunit of the yeast INO80 complex, and we henceforth designate it hIes2. When hIes2 is used as a query in a PSI-BLAST search, the PAPA-1 ortholog from Arabidopsis passes the threshold of 0.001 at the fourth iteration followed by vertebrate co-orthologs at iterations 7–10. We note that although hIes2/PAPA-1 is annotated in the NCBI data base as high mobility group AT-hook 1-like 4, it does not appear to contain recognizable AT-hook or high mobility group DNA-binding domains. Instead, the N-terminal half of the protein consists of a predicted long helical region, whereas the C-terminal half is globular and contains several conserved cysteine residues (data not shown). The human C18orf37 protein is orthologous to the Ies6 subunit of the yeast INO80 complex. Comparison of protein family alignments using the pairwise Hidden Markov Model-based algorithm, HHsearch (35Soding J. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar), indicates that both proteins contain a modified zinc ribbon, most closely related to the YL1 family of putative transcriptional activators (36Horikawa I. Tanaka H. Yuasa Y. Suzuki M. Oshimura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 999-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 37Horikawa I. Tanaka H. Yuasa Y. Suzuki M. Shimizu M. Oshimura M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We previously identified the YL1 protein as a component of the mammalian TRRAP-TIP60 and SRCAP complexes (19Cai Y. Jin J. Florence L. Swanson S.K. Kusch T. Li B. Workman J.L. Washburn M.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13665-13670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The five remaining proteins appear to be unique to the human INO80 complex. NFRKB is a large (more than 1300 amino acids) protein. The C-terminal half of NFRKB contains low complexity, mucin-like repeats. The N-terminal half of this protein is broadly conserved in metazoans (except for Caenorhabditis elegans), in plants, and in Giardia, but it appears to have no homologs in fungi. MCRS1/MSP58 contains a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain in its N terminus. Although there are FHA-like domains in fungi, the N-terminal 350 amino acids of MCRS1 represent a distinct domain, well conserved in metazoans, plants, and some protists, but not found in the available fungal genomes. The FLJ20309 protein has a characteristic pattern of conserved histidine and cysteine residues. Like the MCRS1 protein, FLJ20309 orthologs appear to be present in multicellular eukaryotes but not in fungi. Amida, or TCF3 (E2A) fusion partner in childhood leukemia, contains a putative DNA-binding domain of the b-ZIP type. The FLJ90652 protein has an N-terminal domain that is distantly related to b-ZIP domains. The hINO80 Complex Catalyzes ATP-dependent Nucleosome Sliding— Previous studies revealed that the S. cerevisiae INO80 complex possesses both DNA- and nucleosome-activated ATPase and ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding activities. To investigate the possibility that the mammalian INO80-related complex possesses similar activities, we assayed anti-FLAG agarose eluates from FLAG-hIes2-expressing HeLa cells for ATPase and nucleosome remodeling activities. As shown in Fig. 3, the hINO80 complex, immunopurified from FLAG-hIes2-expressing cells, catalyzed ATP hydrolysis in a reaction that was strongly dependent on the addition of DNA or nucleosomes. Although both mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes stimulated ATPase more strongly than did DNA, free histone octamers had no effect on the reaction. To determine whether the hINO80 complex could catalyze ATP-dependent nucleosome mobilization, anti-FLAG agarose eluates from FLAG-hIes2 expressing HeLa cells were mixed with mononucleosomes reconstituted on a 32P-labeled, 216-base pair DNA fragment in the presence of ATP or a mixture of ATP and ATPγS, a potent inhibitor of many ATPases. At the conclusion of the reaction, HeLa oligonuclesomes and free DNA were added as competitor to remove DNA- or nucleosome-binding proteins that would alter mononucleosome electrophoretic mobility. Reaction products were then fractionated on native polyacrylamide gels. The electrophoretic mobility of mononucleosomes depends on the position of the nucleosome on the DNA. The mobility of a nucleosome positioned in the middle of the DNA fragment is slow, whereas nucleosomes positioned more laterally migrate more rapidly (38Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 39Duband-Goulet I. Carot V. Ulyanov A.V. Douc-Rasy S. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 981-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The reconstituted nucleosomes used in our experiments include a mixture of centrally located and lateral nucleosomes, with the majority of nucleosomes located at the DNA ends (Fig. 4A, lane 4, and B, lane 1). Upon the addition of increasing amounts of the purified hINO80 complex, nucleosomes were shifted to a more central position (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). Similar results were obtained when hINO80 complexes were immunopurified from cells expressing FLAG-Amida or FLAG-FLJ90652 (Fig. 4A, compare lane 11 with lanes 12 and 13). The change in nucleosome position catalyzed by the hINO80 complex depends upon ATP (Fig. 4B) and is inhibited by ATPγS. Thus, like the yeast INO80 complex, the hINO80 complex can support ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding. Notably, both the yeast and human INO80 complexes move nucleosomes from a lateral to a central position. Summary and Perspective—In this report we have exploited a Mud-PIT-based subtractive proteomics approach to identify and characterize a novel mammalian ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that shares structural and functional properties with the S. cerevisiae INO80 complex (TABLE ONE). This new mammalian INO80-related chromatin remodeling complex contains the INO80-like, SNF2 family helicase encoded by the previously uncharacterized KIAA1259 ORF, as well as several additional proteins that appear to be orthologs of subunits of the yeast INO80 complex; these include the Tip49a and Tip49b AAA+ ATPases, the actin-related proteins Arp4, Arp5, and Arp8, hIes2 (PAPA-1), and hIes6 (C18orf37). Notably, the hINO80 complex contains five additional proteins that appear to lack yeast orthologs; these include the b-ZIP domain-containing Amida protein, the forkhead-associated domain-containing MCRS1 protein, the NFRKB protein, and proteins encoded by the FLJ90652 and FLJ20309 ORFs. Finally, we show that, despite these apparent differences in the subunit compositions of the yeast and human INO80 complexes, these complexes possess similar chromatin remodeling activities. Future studies investigating the contributions of the individual subunits of the hINO80 complex should provide more in-depth insights into the functional similarities and differences between the yeast and mammalian chromatin remodeling complexes.TABLE ONEComparison of the subunit compositions of the yeast INO80- and mammalian INO80-related chromatin remodeling complexesYeast INO80Human INO80Molecular function and domain structureComplexGI no.aGI, GenInfo Identifier, a unique identifier for protein or nucleic acid sequences in the NCBI Entrez protein and nucleotide data basesComplexGI no.aGI, GenInfo Identifier, a unique identifier for protein or nucleic acid sequences in the NCBI Entrez protein and nucleotide data basesIno806321289KIAA125933469139SNF2-like helicaseArp82492678Arp839812115Actin-related proteinArp51730738Arp531542680Actin-related proteinArp4728794BAF53a/Arp430089997Actin-related proteinRvb16320396TIP49a4506753AAA + ATPaseRvb26325021TIP49b5730023AAA + ATPaseIes26324114PAPA-113775202Helical, perhaps nonglobular, N-terminal half and mostly β-strand C-terminal halfIes66320791C18orf3734916002Modified zinc ribbon, distantly related to YL-1 family of putative transcription factorsAmida/TCF3 (E2A) fusion partner7019371b-ZIP-type, possibly DNA-binding, proteinFLJ9065227734727Conserved in metazoa (not C. elegans)NFRKB23346420Conserved in metazoa (not C. elegans), plants, Giardia; nonglobular mucin-like C-halfMCRS12384717FHAbFHA, forkhead-associated domain in the C terminusFLJ2030938488718Two copies of CxnHhhhhxnCxnC signature; orthologs in plants and metazoanTaf14461510YEATS domainNhp106320202HMGcHMG, high mobility group type II domain; binds kinked, looped, distorted, or four-way DNAIes114318508Ies36323081Ies46324763Ies56320938a GI, GenInfo Identifier, a unique identifier for protein or nucleic acid sequences in the NCBI Entrez protein and nucleotide data basesb FHA, forkhead-associatedc HMG, high mobility group Open table in a new tab"

Because respiration generates reactive oxygen species as a side-product, we tested the idea that reactive oxygen species regulate Tfam expression through phosphorylation of nuclear respiratory factor (NRF-1) and binding to the Tfam promoter. In mitochondriarich rat hepatoma cells that overexpress NRF-1, basal and oxidant-induced increases were found in Tfam expression and mtDNA content. Specific binding of NRF-1 to Tfam promoter was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. NRF-1-Tfam binding was augmented under pro-oxidant conditions. NRF-1 gene silencing produced 1:1 knockdown of Tfam expression and decreased mtDNA content. To evaluate oxidation-reduction (redox) regulation of NRF-1 in Tfam expression, blockade of upstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was used to demonstrate loss of oxidant stimulation of NRF-1 phosphorylation and Tfam expression. The oxidant response was also abrogated by specific inhibition of Akt/protein kinase B. Examination of the NRF-1 amino acid sequence revealed an Akt phosphorylation consensus at which site-directed mutagenesis abolished NRF-1 phosphorylation by Akt. Finally, Akt phosphorylation and NRF-1 translocation predictably lacked oxidant regulation in a cancer line having no PTEN tumor suppressor (HCC1937 cells). This study discloses novel redox regulation of NRF-1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate kinase/Akt signaling in controlling Tfam induction by an anti-oxidant pro-survival network.

Biochemical studies have demonstrated that human Tfam, like other high mobility group-domain proteins, binds, unwinds, and bends DNA without respect to sequence specificity (4Fisher R.P. Lisowsky T.

Immunochemical studies of Tfam also support the idea that it is involved in nucleoid formation, i.e. packaging mtDNA into protein-DNA aggregates (5Alam T.I. Kanki T. Muta T. Ukaji K. Abe Y.

Tfam helps regulate mammalian mtDNA copy number, and in mice, Tfam disruption causes cytopathy, embryonic lethality, and diabetes due to mtDNA depletion and loss of oxidative phosphorylation (11Larsson N.G.

Tfam expression is coordinated and regulated by a highly specific set of transcription factors, most notably two major trans-acting proteins, the nuclear respiratory factors (NRF-1 and -2) (16Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1309-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Also, the NRF-1 transcription function on Tfam promoter is stimulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1) (17Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G.

Promoter alignment studies indicate that mouse and rat Tfam promoters contain conserved Sp1 and NRF-2 recognition sites, but a standard NRF-1 consensus binding site has not been reported for either species (3Rantanen A. Jansson M. Oldfors A. Larsson N.G. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Genomic footprinting of tumor cells has shown that high levels of Sp1 binding to the Tfam promoter up-regulate the mRNA expression (18Dong X. Ghoshal K. Majumder S. Yadav S.P. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43309-43318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although these controls on Tfam activity have been identified, much information is lacking about retrograde signaling from mitochondria to nucleus and about factors that regulate the protein response to various cellular stressors. Communication between mitochondria and the nucleus is essential to energy homeostasis, and close coordination is especially important because the electron transport chain produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) (19Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Ames B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 71: 10771-10778Crossref Scopus (1837) Google Scholar), which are damaging to mtDNA and loss of oxidative phosphorylation proteins. ROS leakage increases from damaged mitochondria, and low levels of ROS have been proposed as possible retrograde mediators of signaling from mitochondria to nuclei (20Scarpulla R.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Specific pathways have not been elucidated, but we found previously in rat liver cells that the lipophilic oxidant, tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), at low concentrations up-regulates NRF-1 and Tfam (15Suliman H.B. Carraway M.S. Welty-Wolf K.E. Whorton A.R. Piantadosi C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41510-41518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This response was interpreted in the context of inflammation and recovery from mitochondrial genomic damage by an apparent redox signal for nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression. To investigate whether ROS participate in retrograde signaling from mitochondria to nucleus, we tested the hypothesis in rat cells that peroxide regulates Tfam expression through NRF-1 phosphorylation and Tfam promoter binding to service mtDNA maintenance. Materials—All reagents were purchased commercially unless indicated otherwise. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences, and phospho-Akt (Ser473) and Akt substrate antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit αAkt/protein kinase B and NRF-1 antibody and αPTEN monoclonal antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). MitoTracker® Green FM and MitoTracker® Red CM-H2XRos were from Invitrogen. LY294002 was from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). pcDNA 3.1/V5-His TOPO TA expression kit was purchased from Invitrogen, and the Chip It kit was from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). All other chemicals and reagents, including RPMI and Dulbecco's-modified Eagle's medium with 25 mm Hepes and 4.5 g/liter glucose, were from Sigma. Cell Culture—H4IIE rat hepatoma cells (ATTCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in stationary culture in Dulbecco's-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Control hepatocytes were obtained from primary cultures of healthy liver of SD rats. HCC1937 cells (ATTCC) were grown and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.5 g/liter glucose, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cell growth and viability were measured using the Cell Titer-Blue Assay (Promega, Madison WI). Where indicated, cells were preincubated with t-BOOH at 0–135 mm for 1, 3, or 5 h and without or with 50 μm LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate kinase (PI3K) inhibitor) 30 min before oxidant exposure. For specific inhibition of Akt isoenzymes, cells were preincubated with Akt inhibitor VIII (50 μm, Calbiochem) for 30 min before oxidant exposure. Mitochondrial Integrity—Mitochondrial function was assessed by the conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye to formazan in situ by the “succinate-tetrazolium reductase” system of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is active only in metabolically intact cells (21Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). H4IIE cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate and exposed to 10 μm t-BOOH at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were stained with MTT (0.5 mg/ml) for 4 h after incubation with t-BOOH. The resultant formazan crystals were dissolved in 200 μl of Me2SO, and absorbance was measured at 540 nm on an automatic microplate assay reader (Genius, Tecan Systems, Inc. San Jose, CA). MTT reduction was defined relative to untreated control cells, i.e. 100 × (absorbance of treated/absorbance of control sample). Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples (nuclear or cytoplasm) were separated by standard SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with Tris-buffered saline/Tween containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 12 h at 4 °C. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with antibodies to NRF-1 (1:2000), NRF-2 (1:5000), actin (1:5000; Sigma), tubulin (1:1000; Sigma), phosphorylated-Akt (1:1000) Akt (1:1000), or PTEN (1:2000). After five washes in Tris-buffered saline/Tween, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences), and protein expression was quantified on digitized images from the mid-dynamic range and normalized to β-actin or tubulin in the same sample. At least four samples were used for densitometry measurements. Rat Tfam mRNA Expression—RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 1 μg of each sample was reverse-transcribed (20-μl volume) using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a buffer of random hexamer primers, dNTPs, and ribonuclease inhibitor (RNasin, Promega). Gene transcripts were amplified in triplicate by RT-PCR using specific primers Tfam sense, 5′-GCTTCCAGGAGGCTAAGGAT-3′, and Tfam antisense, 5′-CCCAATCCCAATGACAACTC-3′. 18 S rRNA was used to control for variation in efficiency of RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and PCR for nuclear RNA expression. Plasmids Expressing Rat NRF-1—NRF-1 expression vectors were constructed by RT-PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The rat NRF-1 coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number XM231566) was amplified with the NRF-1 primers sense, 5′-ATGGAGGAACACGGAGTGAC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCTTTTTGGGACAGTGAAAT-3′. The product was ligated into pcDNA 3.1/V5-His TOPO TA expression vector to express wild type NRF-1 (WT-NRF1, pc-NRF-1) fusion protein from a cytomegalovirus promoter. Mutant NRF-1 (mut-NRF-1, pcΔNRF-1) was created in which threonine was replaced with alanine in an Akt motif by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II kit (Stratagene) and the mut-NRF-1 primers sense (5′-AAAGAGACAGCAGACgcggttgcttcg aaac-3′) and antisense (5′-GTTTCCGAAGCAACCGcgtctgctgtctcttt-3′). H4IIE cells at 50–70% confluence were transfected with these or empty vector using manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). Cells were grown to 80–90% confluence, and WT and mutant NRF-1 recombinant proteins were purified using the ProBond purification system with anti-V5-horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation—WT or mutant NRF-1 recombinant vectors were transfected transiently into H4IIE cells. Non-transfected and transfected cells were treated with t-BOOH (10 μm) without or with LY294002 (50 μm) 30 min before oxidant exposure. After incubation for 3 h, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 20 min in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates or nuclear extracts (100 μg) were incubated with phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate antibody or with αNRF-1 antibody overnight at 4 °C and protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h. Beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer for Western analysis using anti-phospho-Ser/Thr monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) or NRF-1 primary antibody (1:2000). Cloning of Rat Hepatoma Tfam—The 5′ region encompassing the promoter and 5′ region of Tfam was cloned by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Primers were designed from the published Tfam sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF264733), and rat genomic DNA was used as a template. The amplified DNA was cloned into TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and both strands were sequenced using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing system with AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase combined with ABI 3730 and 3100 PRISM DNA-sequencing instruments. Real-time DNA PCR—DNA primers were designed to detect COII and β-actin at a maximum amplicon length of 150 bp: β-actin forward, 5′-TGTTCCCTTCCACAGGGTGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCCCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCA-3′; COII forward, 5′-TGAGCCATCCCTTCACTAGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGAGCCGCAAATTTCAGAG-3′. The PCR reaction mixture contained 1× platinum SYBR green qPCR SuperMix UDG (Invitrogen), 500 nm each primer, and ∼10 ng of total genomic DNA or mtDNA. Real-time PCR conditions were 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C. Fluorescence intensities during PCR were recorded and analyzed in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems 7000 SDS software). The threshold cycle (CT) is the cycle at which the first significant increase in the fluorescent signal is detected. CT values in the linear exponential phase were used to measure the original DNA template copy numbers from a standard curve generated from five 10-fold dilutions of either pure mtDNA (COII) or pure nuclear DNA (β-actin). Relative values for COII and β-actin within samples were used to obtain a ratio of mtDNA to nuclear DNA in that sample. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—NRF-1 EMSA was performed with [γ-32P]ATP polynucleotide kinase-labeled oligonucleotides annealed to double-stranded oligonucleotides or PCR fragments. Binding assays were carried out on 10 μg of nuclear extract from hepatocytes or hepatoma cells (15Suliman H.B. Carraway M.S. Welty-Wolf K.E. Whorton A.R. Piantadosi C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41510-41518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For supershifts, the reactions included 0.5–1 μg of undiluted goat anti-NRF-1 antiserum. For competition, excess unlabeled oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extract before adding labeled or unspecific oligonucleotide. After 20 min at room temperature, samples were loaded on pre-run 5% native polyacrylamide for 2.5 h at 10 V/cm, and the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. DNA oligonucleotide sequences of human Tfam were used for EMSA (NRF-1 recognition sites are underlined): Tfam NRF-1A, 5′-CGCTCTCCCGCGCCTGCGCCAATT; Tfam NRF-1B, 5′-GGGCGGAATTGGCGCAGGCGCGGG. The DNA oligonucleotide sequences of human Tfam at which NRF-1 recognition sites is mutated have been reported (15Suliman H.B. Carraway M.S. Welty-Wolf K.E. Whorton A.R. Piantadosi C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41510-41518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Rat Tfam promoter oligonucleotides were Tfam-205, 5′-TCAGAGGGGCCTGCGGCT-3′, and Tfam-185, 5′-AGCCGCAGGCCCCTCTGA-3′. Oligonucleotides for Sp1 and AP1 were purchased from Promega, and a rat Tfam promoter PCR fragment was generated using oligonucleotide pairs Tfam forward, 5′-GATACATTTCATGACCACTC-3′, and Tfam reverse, 5′-ACGGATGATGGACGAACGA-3′. NRF-1 Phosphorylation—To determine the effect of mutation of the Akt motif on NRF-1 phosphorylation, hepatoma cells were transfected with either WT-NRF-1 vector or mutant NRF-1 vector using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were collected in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm NaF, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysate was collected and immunoprecipitated using anti-V5 antibody to bind the carboxyl-terminal V5 epitope tag of recombinant NRF-1 protein. Immunocomplex proteins were incubated with 100 ng/50 μl reaction of Akt/protein kinase B (Cell Signaling Technology) for 30 min with trace amounts of [γ-32P]ATP. The mixture containing phosphorylated recombinant protein was electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. NRF-1 Gene Silencing—Silencing experiments were performed using small interfering NRF-1 (siNRF-1) duplexes to target sequences in the open reading frame of NRF-1 mRNA. Multiple nucleotide sense and antisense siRNAs were synthesized and obtained in annealed form from Ambion. The siRNA target sequences were submitted to BLAST searches against other rat genome sequences to ensure specificity. After preliminary studies, one pair of siRNA sequences was selected and transfected at a concentration of 80 nm into H4IIE cells using Oligofectamine™ (Invitrogen) sense, 5′-GGAGGUUAAUUCAGAGCUG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CAGCUCUGAAUUAACCUCC-3′. A scrambled negative control siRNA from Ambion was also used. The effect of siRNA on NRF-1 and Tfam mRNA expression was established by both conventional and quantitative real time RT-PCR. For real-time PCR expression analysis, cells transfected with siNRF-1 or scrambled siRNA were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were then DNase-treated with a DNA-free kit (Ambion). Treated RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed in 20-μl reaction mixtures with random hexamer primers and the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two microliters of undiluted cDNA were used per reaction; a standard curve for NRF-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was generated from serial dilutions of positively expressed cDNA. The probe and primer sets were “pre-designed assay on demand” probes (Applied Biosystems) tested and standardized for reproducible expression analysis. Primer and cDNA were added to TaqMan universal master mix (Applied Biosystems) containing all the reagents for PCR. Relative quantification of the PCR products was carried out using the ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems) and a method that compares the amount of target gene amplification normalized to an endogenous reference (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). The formula was 2–ΔΔCT, representing the n-fold differential gene expression in a treated sample compared with the control, where CT is the mean threshold cycle (cycle at which the product is detected initially). ΔCt was the difference in the CTvalues for the target gene and the reference gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (in each sample assayed), and ΔΔCt represents the difference between CT of control and sample. ChIP Assay—Cells were transfected with NRF-1, WT, or mutant vectors and 48 h later were treated with 50 μm LY294002 30 min before 10 μm t-BOOH. After 3 h, 37% formaldehyde was placed directly into the medium of 4.5 × 107 cells to achieve a 1% final concentration. After 30 min at 37 °C, formaldehyde was quenched with 0.125 m glycine. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and processed for immunoprecipitation using a kit (ChIP It assay kit, Active Motif) and NRF-1 antibody or V5 antibody following the manufacturer's protocol. After ethanol precipitation, DNA was resuspended in 200 μl/107 cells, and 2–5 μl were used as the template for each PCR. Input samples represent 1% of total DNA and were diluted 1:5, and immunoprecipitated fractions were diluted 1:2. PCR was carried out on 1 μl of each sample using sense primer, 5′-GGC AGTTTGCTGCTGGGT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GGCACTGTGGGAGGCCCA-3′, to amplify a 331-bp segment of the rat Tfam gene at –359 to –28 from the transcription start site. PCR products were analyzed on 2% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Immunocytochemistry and Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy— Rat H4IIE cells or human HCC1937 cells were grown in one- or two-well LabTek chamber slides and treated with t-BOOH (10 μm). The cells were then washed with Hanks' solution and incubated in normal media with MitoTracker® green (200 nm for H4IIE cells) or MitoTracker® red (100 nm for HCC1937 cells), incubated for 20 min, and rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution. H4IIE cells were fixed with cold 70:30 acetone/ethanol (v/v) for 10 min and blocked for 1 h with 10% fetal bovine serum in Hanks' solution at room temperature. The cells were incubated for 1 h with rabbit ant-NRF-1 primary antibodies followed by FluoroLink Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. After extensive washing to remove unbound antibodies, the cells were mounted using the Slow Fade kit (Invitrogen). HCC1937 cells were mounted with Slow Fade immediately after fixation. Specific immunostaining was assessed by using one or both secondary antibodies without primary antibody. Multiple dilutions of each primary and secondary antibody were tested and optimized to minimize nonspecific adsorption of fluorescent antibodies, ensure separation of fluorescent signals, and optimize fluorophore concentration. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed on an LSM 410 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Fluorescence images were collected using appropriate band-pass filters at excitation wavelengths of 488 and 568 and emission wavelengths of 520 and 590 nm. Statistics—Group values were expressed as the means ± S.D. Significance was tested by Student's unpaired t test, and a p value of <0.05 was accepted as significant. The n values provided refer to independent samples. Tfam and mtDNA Expression in H4IIE Rat Hepatoma Cells—Tfam mRNA levels were compared by RT-PCR in H411E rat hepatoma cells and normal rat hepatocytes. Tfam transcript analysis indicated a 5-fold higher expression level in hepatoma relative to normal hepatocytes (Fig. 1A). On this basis it was anticipated that transcription factors involved in Tfam gene expression would be up-regulated in rat hepatoma cells. Comparison of steady-state expression levels of NRF-1 and NRF-2 protein by Western blot analysis in normal rat hepatocytes and hepatoma cells (Fig. 1B) indicated that NRF-1 and NRF-2 protein levels were 4- and 3-fold higher, respectively, in rat hepatoma cells compared with normal hepatocytes (p < 0.05 for n = 4, graph not shown). For unknown reasons, these differences were only associated with 25% more mtDNA per H4IIE cell by real time PCR compared with normal rat hepatocytes (not shown). Because of the uncertainty that NRF-1 regulated Tfam gene expression in rat hepatoma cells, the 5′ upstream region of Tfam was cloned first. The nucleotide sequences for the 5′-upstream region and exon one of rat hepatoma Tfam are shown in Fig. 2A. The cloned region showed 99.4% sequence homology with the normal upstream region of rat Tfam (GenBank™ accession number AF264733). The transcription start site is numbered +1 according to the rat cDNA sequence (22Inagaki H. Hayashi T. Matsushima T. Lin K.H. Maeda S. Ichihara S. Kitagawa Y. Saito T. DNA Sequencing. 2000; 11: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A computer-assisted sequence analysis of the 5′ promoter region identified a putative NRF-1 binding site in the Tfam promoter region (Fig. 2A). This motif is a near-perfect match for the NRF-1 consensus and contains all the invariant nucleotides in functional NRF-1 recognition sites (23FitzGerald P.C. Shlyakhtenko A. Mir A.A. Vinson C. Genome Res. 2004; 8: 1562-1574Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Scarpulla R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1576: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 25Kelly D.P. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). The binding site showed high homology with the human Tfam sequence (Fig. 2B) but overlapped with the Sp1 site, indicating the complex organization of the rat promoter. Effect of Exogenous Oxidant on Tfam Expression—To determine whether oxidants mediated Tfam gene expression, hepatoma cells were exposed to low concentrations of t-BOOH for 1 to 5 h. These exposures led to ∼10-fold increases in cellular Tfam gene expression (Fig. 3A) and were associated with stimulation of cell growth by 24h (Fig. 3B) and comparable increases in MTT reduction and mtDNA content by 48 h (Fig. 3C). Functional Characterization of the 5′-Flanking Region of Rat Tfam— To determine whether the putative NRF-1 consensus in rat Tfam could act as a cis element and bind NRF-1, EMSAs were performed in rat hepatoma cell nuclear extracts with oligonucleotides containing the NRF-1 recognition site of human Tfam. NRF-1 produced a slow-migrating band that was lost after the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide or PCR products containing the full rat Tfam promoter (–462/+79) or the GC-rich oligonucleotides –205 to –185 (Fig. 4A). Binding was checked and confirmed for recombinant NRF-1 protein alone. The results indicated that the cloned rat Tfam pr"

Activation of TLR2 signaling not only induces the activation of innate immunity and instructs the development of the acquired immunity but also leads to the detrimental inflammatory responses in inflammatory and infectious diseases. To avoid detrimental inflammatory responses, TLR2 signaling must be tightly regulated. In contrast to the relative known positive regulation of TLR2 signaling, its negative regulation, however, is largely unknown. In addition the distal signaling components that link TLR2 to its downstream signaling pathways have yet to be further defined. In the present study we have provided direct evidence for the negative regulation of TLR2 signaling by the tumor suppressor cylindromatosis (CYLD). We showed that activation of TLR2 signaling by TLR2 ligands including peptidoglycan (PGN), MALP-2, and Pam3CSK4 induces activation of IKKs-IκBα and MKK3/6-p38 pathways not only by TRAF6 but also by TRAF7, a recently identified TRAF family member. The activation of both pathways leads to the transcription of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 as well as CYLD. CYLD in turn leads to the inhibition of TRAF6 and TRAF7 likely via a deubiquitination-dependent mechanism. The present studies thus unveil a novel autoregulatory feedback mechanism that negatively controls TLR2-IKKs-IκBα/MKK3/6-p38-NF-κB-dependent induction of immune and inflammatory responses via negatively cross-talking with both TRAF6 and TRAF7.

TLRs are type I transmembrane receptors with leucine-rich repeats in the extracellular domains and cytoplasmic domains that resemble the mammalian IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) (1Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev.

Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). To date, 11 members of the human TLR family have been cloned (1Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev.

Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Of these, TLR2 and TLR4 have been well studied. While TLR4 seems to be mainly involved in Gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide signaling, TLR2 can respond to a variety of bacterial products, including peptidoglycan (PGN), lipoprotein, lipoteichoic acid, and lipoarabinomannan (1Akira S.

The importance of TLR2 in host defense was further highlighted by the studies from knock-out mice showing decreased survival of TLR2-deficient mice after infection with Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (9Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our recent study demonstrated that TLR2 also plays a key role in activating host immune and inflammatory response by surface lipoprotein from the Gram-negative bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of otitis media and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (10Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T.F. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Jono H. Shuto T. Xu H. Kai H.

Similar to other TLRs, the negative regulation of TLR2 signaling also remains largely unclear.

In the present study, we provided evidence for the first time that activation of TLR2 signaling by TLR2 ligands induces activation of IKKs-IκBα and MKK3/6-p38 signaling pathways not only by TRAF6 but also by TRAF7. The activation of both IKKs-IκBα and MKK3/6-p38 pathways will induce transcription of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 as well as CYLD. CYLD in turn leads to the inhibition of TRAF6 and TRAF7 likely via a deubiquitination-dependent mechanism. The present studies thus identified a novel autoregulatory feedback mechanism that negatively controls TLR2-IKKs-IκBα/MKK3/6-p38-NF-κB-dependent induction of immune and inflammatory responses via negatively cross-talking with both TRAF6 and TRAF7. These findings provide novel insights into autoregulation and negative regulation of TLR signaling.

For the reverse transcription reaction, TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) were used. Briefly, the reverse transcription reaction was performed for 60 min at 37 °C, followed by 60 min at 42 °C by using oligo(dT) and random hexamers. PCR amplification was performed by using TaqMan universal master mix for human TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, and CYLD, or by using SYBR Green universal master mix for human TRAF7. In brief, reactions were performed in duplicate containing 2× universal master mix, 1 μl of template cDNA, 100 nm primers, and 100 nm probe in a final volume of 12.5 μl, and they were analyzed in a 96-well optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems). Probes for TaqMan include a fluorescent reporter dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein, on the 5′ end and labeled with a fluorescent quencher dye, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, on the 3′ end to allow direct detection of the PCR product. Reactions were amplified and quantified by using as ABI 7700 sequemce detector and the manufacturer's corresponding software (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantity of mRNAs were obtained by using the comparative Ct method (for details, see User Bulletin 2 for the Applied Biosystems PRISM 7700 sequence-detection system) and was normalized by using TaqMan predeveloped assay reagent human cyclophilin as an endogenous control (Applied Biosystems). Universal master mix and TaqMan predeveloped assay reagents (primer and probe mixture of human TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The primers and probe for human CYLD were as follows: 5′-ACG CCA CAA TCT TCA TCA CAC T-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AGG TCG TGG TCA AGG TTT CAC T-3′ (reverse primer); TaqMan probe, 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-AAA AAG CTG TTT CCC TTG GTA CAC CCC C-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-3′. The primers for human TRAF7 were as follows: 5′-TGG AGT TCC GGC GGG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AGC CGC GCG TTG ATG T-3′ (reverse primer). Immunofluorescence—Cells were cultured on four-chamber slides. After treatment with PGN, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min. Fixed cells were subsequently blocked with 1.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min and incubated with 1:250 dilution of mouse anti-p65 NF-κB antibody for 1 h (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary antibody was detected with 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were examined and photographed by using an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss). For analyzing the co-localization of CYLD with TRAF6 and TRAF7, cells were co-transfected with the indicated combinations of TRAF6, HA-TRAF7, and FLAG-CYLD plasmids. After fixing, permeabilizing, and blocking, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-TRAF6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma).

Traditionally, genetic mutagenesis has proven to be a useful tool in solving the function of a wide range of genes in biological process. Recently, a chemical genetic approach has been developed to elucidate the principles of a wide range of biological processes (for review, see Refs. 1Schreiber S.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 1127-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 2Stockwell B.R. Nature. 2004; 432: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 3Mayer T.U. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 270-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In chemical genetics, instead of site-specific mutation as in traditional genetics, the function of a protein is inhibited or activated using small chemicals. Therefore, chemical genetics seeks to identify novel small molecules that afford functional dissection of cell biological pathways. Such chemicals are useful as bioactive molecular probes and allow further analysis of the relationship between target processes or proteins within cells and their cellular function. Metastasis plays a major role in morbidity and mortality from breast cancer (4Mundy G.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 584-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). The metastatic potential of cancer cells is related to the ability to digest the extracellular matrix, migrate, cross blood vessel walls, and reach the blood circulation (for review, see Refs. 5Pantel K. Brakenhoff R.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 6Friedl P. Wolf K. Nat. Rev.

Cell movement is a complex process involving a number of steps, including the disruption of cell-cell junctions, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and the constant remodeling of adhesive contacts with the extracellular matrix (for review, see Refs. 9Ridley A.J.

Cell migration contributes to several other important pathological processes, including vascular disease, osteoporosis, chronic inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, cancer, and mental retardation. Anticancer drug development strategy has traditionally focused on inhibition of cancer cell growth. However, other processes in tumor progression can be potential targets for cancer treatment. Among these, migration is one of the interesting processes in tumor progression. Expression of different growth factor receptors in malignant cells has been reported and can participate not only in transducing growth signals, but also in contributing to the motile properties of malignant cancer cells. Multiple growth factors and their receptors are involved in the malignant progression (12van der Valk P. Lindeman J. Kamphorst W. Ann. Oncol. 1997; 8: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The number of cells expressing multiple growth factors and their receptors tends to increase with increasing malignancy grade. High metastatic cells exhibit higher spontaneous rates of migration compared with their low metastatic counterparts (13Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 14Volk T. Geiger B. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 811-824PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp27 (heat shock protein of 27 kDa) belongs to a family of abundant and ubiquitous stress proteins that are detectable in virtually all organisms from prokaryotes to mammals (15Concannon C.G. Gorman A.M. Samali A. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In unstressed cells, Hsp27 levels are generally low, and it exists predominantly as a large oligomeric unit of up to 800 kDa. The size of this oligomeric unit is dependent on a number of parameters, including temperature and degree of phosphorylation of Hsp27 (16Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 17Zantema A. Verlaan-De Vries M. Maasdam D. Bol S. van der Eb A. J. Biol.

Under stress conditions, an increase in the level of Hsp27 expression is preceded by phosphorylation-induced reorganization of the multimeric status of Hsp27. Phosphorylation occurs at four different residues, Ser-15, Ser-78, Ser-82, and Thr-143, and this induces redistribution of the large oligomers to small tetrameric units (16Lavoie J.N. Lambert H.

Hsp27 has been recognized as a potent regulator of cytoskeleton dynamics (actin microfilaments). The actin cytoskeleton is modulated by both the spatial arrangement as well as the polymerization dynamics of its different elements (25Liang P. MacRae T.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Hsp27 increases the stability of F-actin microfilaments during exposure to stress (26Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G.

Actin microfilaments are not the only components of the cytoskeleton that have been reported to interact with Hsp27. Hsp27 colocalizes with tubulin/microtubles (29Hino M. Kurogi K.

We now report that we have identified anti-migratory compounds by chemical library screening. One of the inhibitors, KRIBB3, inhibited both tumor cell migration and invasion. In addition, we found that KRIBB3 bound to Hsp27 and inhibited cell migration by blocking PKC-dependent Hsp27 phosphorylation. Materials—Anti-phospho-Ser-78 Hsp27 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Antibodies against Hsp27, AKT, phospho-AKT, phospho-PKCμ, and phosphorylated phospholipase Cβ3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and p130cas and antibody PY-20 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Chemicals used in these experiments were purchased from Sigma and Calbiochem. CAC-1098 (aurintricarboxylic acid) was purchased from Sigma, and CBI-1098 (5-(2,4-dimethoxy-5-ethylphenyl)-4-(4-bromophenyl) isoxazole) and KRIBB3 (5-(5-ethyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl) isoxazole) were synthesized in our laboratory. Cell Culture—The cell lines used were obtained originally from American Type Culture Collection. The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplement with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and 25 mm HEPES. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in an incubator. Construction of an Hsp27-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 Cell Line— Full-length Hsp27 was obtained by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-CGCGGATCCATGACCGAGCGCCGCGTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGAATTCGTGGGCATCCGGGCTAAGG-3′ (antisense) with an expressed sequence tag clone containing Hsp27 (Korean UniGene Clone ID hMU001508, cDNA clone MGC:21487) as a template. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and then inserted into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector that had been digested with BamHI and EcoRI. To generate cells stably expressing Hsp27, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine and 1 μg of pcDNA3.1-Hsp27. Clones were selected in growth medium containing 0.8 mg/ml G418 for 21 days. To avoid colony-specific variation, we used whole populations of selected colonies for further study. Knockdown of the Hsp27 Protein Using Hsp27 Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—The Hsp27 and control siRNAs were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Cells plated at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates were transfected with 100 nm Hsp27 and control siRNA oligoduplexes after preincubation for 20 min with Oligofectamine in serum-free Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). 4 h after the beginning of the incubation, 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 30% FBS was added (without antibiotics). 48 h after transfection, cells were collected and used for migration assay or for preparation of whole cell lysates. Cell Proliferation Assays—Proliferation assays were performed as described previously (38Han D.C. Lee M-Y. Shin K.D. Jeon S.B. Kim J.M. Son K.-H. Kim H.C. Kim H.M. Kwon B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6911-6920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5000 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. After 20-24 h, cells were replenished with fresh complete medium containing either a test compound or 0.1% Me2SO. After incubation for 48 h, the cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (Roche Applied Science) was added to each well. The amount of WST-1 formazan produced was measured at 450 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Bio-Rad). Cell Migration Assays—Migration was measured using a 48-well Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Various concentrations of chemicals in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS were placed into the base wells separated from the top wells by polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size, 25 × 80 mm, polyvinylpyrrolidone-free; Neuro Probe, Inc.). Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed once with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and washed twice with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and added to the upper chamber at 8 × 103 cells/well. Cells were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. At the end of the experiment, cells were fixed with methanol for 10 min and stained with modified Giemsa stain (Sigma) for 1 h. Cells on the upper side of the membrane were then removed using a cotton swab. The migrated cells were counted under a light microscope at ×100 magnifications. The following kinase inhibitors were used at the concentrations indicated: rottlerin (PKCδ inhibitor; 5 μm), PD98059 (MEK inhibitor; 40 μm), bisindolylmaleimide I (broad PKC inhibitor; 5 μm), Y27632 (ROCK inhibitor; 10 μm), wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor; 10 μm), SB203580 (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor; 10 μm), AG1478 (epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor; 10 μm), and PP2 (Src inhibitor; 50 μm). Cell Invasion Assay—MDA-MB-231 cells were starved overnight in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Thawed Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was diluted 1:20 with 1× RPMI 1640 medium, and 100 μl was used to coat each invasion chamber (Transwell, BD Biosciences) equipped with an 8-μm pore size Micropore filter. After the chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, unbound Matrigel was aspirated and rinsed gently using serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. The Matrigel barrier was reconstituted with 100 μlof serum-free medium for 2 h at 37 °C. In the meantime, MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested after trypsinization, washed once with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and washed twice with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were diluted to 1 × 105 cells/ml, and 200 μl was inoculated into the upper chamber. 10% FBS as chemoattractant was added to 24-well culture dishes. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the Matrigel on the filter was removed with a cotton swab. The filter was then stained with crystal violet (300 μl of 5 mg/ml crystal violet dissolved in 20% methanol) and incubated for 30 min. The membrane was washed several times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells that had penetrated the filter were counted under a microscope. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Lysates were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described previously (38Han D.C. Lee M-Y. Shin K.D. Jeon S.B. Kim J.M. Son K.-H. Kim H.C. Kim H.M. Kwon B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6911-6920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 40 μg of protein was resolved by 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Applied Science). The membrane was blocked with 1% Western blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). The primary antibodies were used as recommended by the manufacturers. The secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The membrane was incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times with Tris-buffered saline/Tween, and visualized with chemiluminescent β-peroxidase reagents (Roche Applied Science). For immunoprecipitation, 400 μg of lysates was incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at 4°Cin a rotary shaker, and 40 μl of protein G-agarose beads was then added. After 1 h, bead-containing lysates were centrifuged and washed three times with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm Na2HPC4, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm NaVO4, 2 mm PMSF, and 1% aprotinin). Bead-bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using specific antibody. Detection of KRIBB3-binding Proteins—MDA-MB-231 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then homogenized using a 27-gauge syringe in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. After the supernatant of MDA-MB-231 cells had been precleared by incubation with immobilized streptavidin (Sigma) for 60 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, the cleared supernatants were incubated with biotinyl-KRIBB3 compound. After incubation for 2 h at 4°C, proteins associated with the biotinyl-KRIBB3 compound were precipitated with UltraLink-immobilized NeutrAvidin-agarose (Pierce). Precipitated samples were applied to the column. Samples were washed with 10 bed volumes of wash buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml; Roche Applied Science). Samples were eluted from the column with 5 bed volumes of elution buffer (0.1 m glycine HCl (pH 2.8)). Samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Peptide Analysis of the KRIBB3-binding Protein—In-gel specific KRIBB3-binding protein was cut out and sent to the Korea Basic Science Institute (Daejeon, Korea) for peptide analysis. The sample was digested with trypsin. Peptide tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the digested peptides was performed using an electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer as described previously (39Nam M.H. Heo E.J. Kim J.Y. Kim S.I. Kwon K.H. Seo J.B. Kwon O. Yoo J.S. Park Y.M. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 2351-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Screening of Anti-migratory Chemicals—We searched for anti-migratory compounds using cell-based screening. A whole cell-based assay was preferred because of its ability to simultaneously assess multiple targets. In addition, this approach can avoid problems with drug permeability by identifying active compounds that freely enter the cell. The effect of chemicals on the cell migration of MDA-MB-231 cells was measured using a modified Boyden chamber assay (Fig. 1A). Cell migration was performed in the presence of 10 μm chemical, and 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant. The components provided by serum are certain highly specific proteins called growth factors. Serum-containing growth factors are insulin-like growth factor-1, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. Upon screening ∼12,000 synthetic chemicals for “cell stoppers” that inhibit migration of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, we identified CAC-1098 and CBI-0997 (Fig. 1B). CAC-1098 and CBI-0997 inhibited migration of MDA-MB-231 cells with IC50 = 5 and 50 nm, respectively (Fig. 1C). To clarify whether the inhibitory action on motile functions could be due to a cytotoxic effect, the cell stoppers were tested for their effects on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. The cell stoppers CAC-1098 and CBI-0997 inhibited proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells with GI50 > 100 and 25 μm, respectively (Fig. 1D), where GI50 is the concentration of an inhibition at which 50% inhibition of the cell growth is seen. These results indicate that the cell stoppers significantly inhibit cell migration at 0.1-1 μm without cytotoxic problems. We synthesized several derivatives of CBI-0997 and analyzed their anti-migratory activities. 4K. D. Shin, M.-Y. Lee, D.-S. Shin, S. Lee, K.-H. Son, S. Koh, Y.-K. Paik, B.-M. Kwon, and D. C. Han, unpublished data. In this study, we found that replacement of the bromide group with a methoxyl group did not change its anti-migratory activity, and we decided to study the methoxyl derivative further. We named the methoxyl derivative (5-(5-ethyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl) isoxazole) KRIBB3 (Fig. 1B). KRIBB2 (4-ethyl-5-methoxy-2-(3-methyl-4-phenylisoxazole-5-yl)phenol) is an inactive analog of KRIBB3 and was used as a negative control. CAC-1098, another identified cell stopper, is a polymeric carboxylated triphenylmethane derivative (Fig. 1B). Aurintricarboxylic acid has been reported to be an angiogenesis inhibitor (40Gagliardi A. Collins D.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 533-535PubMed Google Scholar) and to have anti-proliferative activity in vascular smooth muscle cells (41Benezra M. Ben-Sasson S.A. Regan J. Chang M. Bar-Shavit R. Vlodavsky I. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1992-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, when MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 0.01 μm CAC-1098, >80% of cell migration was inhibited. In addition, we could not detect any anti-proliferative activity of CAC-1098 up to 10 μm (Fig. 1, C and D). This result implies the possibility that CAC-1098 may inhibit angiogenesis by inhibiting migration of vascular endothelial cells. It will be interesting to test this possibility. Successful identification of previously known anti-angiogenesis compounds validated our approach to identify novel compounds that may inhibit cell migration. Inhibition of Tumor Invasion by Cell Stoppers—The invasive behavior of cancer cells is accompanied by increased cell movement. This suggests that cell stoppers can block tumor invasion. The effect of cell stoppers on MDA-MB-231 cell invasion through Matrigel-coated porous filters in response to a chemotactic stimulus was examined in an 8-μm pore size invasion chamber assay. Cells were treated with cell stoppers at different concentrations (0-100 μm) for 24 h, and 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant. CAC-1098 and KRIBB3 inhibited invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with half-maximal inhibition at 2.8 and 0.15 μm, respectively (Fig. 1, E and F). In particular, invasion was almost completely blocked by 1 μm KRIBB3 (by ∼90%). Analysis of Phosphorylation of FAK, p130cas, and AKT—When cells were treated with KRIBB3, they became rounded within 5 min (Fig. 2A). Cells treated with vehicle (Me2SO) did not induce any detectable morphological changes (data not shown). Cell spreading is regulated by integrin receptors and ligands (extracellular matrix). Activation of integrins induces phosphorylation of many focal adhesion proteins, including FAK (42Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) and p130cas (43Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Cells lacking the tyrosine kinase FAK or Src have more and larger adhesions and migrate poorly (44Webb D.J. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4 (-E100): E97Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 45Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 220: 145-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The interaction of FAK with Src and the adaptor proteins p130cas and Crk appears to regulate adhesion turnover. Therefore, we analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of whole cell lysates or specific focal adhesion proteins after immunoprecipitation. In general, tyrosine phosphorylation of whole cell lysates increased upon KRIBB3 treatment, reached a maximum after 3 h, and then gradually decreased (Fig. 2B). However, the profile of tyrosine phosphorylation of whole cell lysates was not altered by treatment with Me2SO. To test whether FAK is tyrosine-phosphorylated by KRIBB3, FAK was immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibody and blotted with phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, we could not detect any decrease in FAK phosphorylation. In contrast, we could see a significant increase in FAK phosphorylation 3 h after KRIBB3 treatment. Similarly, p130cas was immunoprecipitated with anti-p130cas antibody and analyzed with phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. However, we could not detect any decrease in p130cas phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that FAK and p130cas are not involved in KRIBB3-induced anti-migratory activity. Directed cell migration toward a soluble growth factor is a general phenotype of motile cells and requires highly polarized intracellular signaling events promoting the recruitment of pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins to the leading edge (46Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1999; 284: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 47Firtel R.A. Chung C.Y. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This localized increase in phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates is the result of spatial activation of PI3K (48Funamoto S. Meili R. Lee S. Parry L. Firtel R.A. Cell. 2002; 109:"

This secreted protein is not synthesized in young healthy cartilage, but is produced in cartilage from old donors or patients with osteoarthritis. The molecular processes governing the induction of CHI3L1 are currently unknown. To elucidate the molecular events involved in CHI3L1 synthesis, we investigated two models of articular chondrocytes: neonatal rat chondrocytes, which do not express CHI3L1, and human chondrocytes, which express CHI3L1 constitutively. In neonatal rat chondrocytes, the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 potently induced steady-state levels of CHI3L1 mRNA and protein secretion. Treatment of chondrocytes with TNF-α for as little as 1 h was sufficient for sustained induction up to 72 h afterward. Using inhibitors selective for the major signaling pathways implicated in mediating the effects of TNF-α and interleukin-1, only inhibition of NF-κB activation was effective in curtailing cytokine-induced expression, including after removal of the cytokine, indicating that induction and continued production of CHI3L1 are controlled mainly by this transcription factor. Inhibition of NF-κB signaling also abolished constitutive expression by human chondrocytes. Thus, induction and continued secretion of CHI3L1 in chondrocytes require sustained activation of NF-κB. Selective induction of CHI3L1 by cytokines acting through NF-κB coupled with the known restriction of the catabolic responses by CHI3L1 in response to these inflammatory cytokines represents a key regulatory feedback process in controlling connective tissue turnover.

CHI3L1 is a 39-kDa glycoprotein secreted by articular chondrocytes (6Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), synoviocytes (7Nyirkos P. Golds E.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and differentiated macrophages (8Krause S.W. Rehli M. Kreutz M. Schwarzfischer L. Paulauskis J.D. Andreesen R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is a member of a family of mammalian proteins belonging structurally to glycohydrolase family 18 (9Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar), which includes bacterial and vertebrate as well as invertebrate chitinases. The mammalian group of this family consists of catalytically active members (chitinase-1 or chitotriosidase and acidic mammalian chitinase) and several inactive ones (CHI3L1 and CHI3L2 in humans and YM1 and YM2 in mice). The structures of the human CHI3L1 (10Houston D.R. Recklies A.D. Krupa J.C. van Aalten D.M.F. J. Biol.

However, although a lectin-like function has been predicted, no physiological ligands have as yet been identified. CHI3L1 is synthesized constitutively by isolated human articular chondrocytes or in cartilage explants (6Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas its secretion from macrophages in vitro is associated with differentiation preceding induction and secretion of chitotriosidase (8Krause S.W. Rehli M. Kreutz M. Schwarzfischer L. Paulauskis J.D. Andreesen R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). CHI3L1 is secreted from human articular cartilage explants or isolated human chondrocytes in culture, although its expression in vivo is restricted to older and osteoarthritic cartilage (14Volck B. Ostergaard K. Johansen J.S. Garbarsch C. Price P.A. Scand. J. Rheumatol. 1999; 28: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Secretion of CHI3L1 from cartilage explants diminishes with time in culture, but renewed cutting of the explants appears to restore secretion levels (15Johansen J.S. Olee T. Price P.A. Hashimoto S. Ochs R.L. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 826-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that CHI3L1 production is an injury response of the tissue. However, the factors that induce this response or how production is maintained for a relatively long time period is not known. Synthesis of CHI3L1 was reported to be enhanced by insulin-like growth factor 1 in isolated guinea pig chondrocytes (16De Ceuninck F. Pastoureau P. Bouet F. Bonnet J. Vanhoutte P.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 414-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, like human chondrocytes, these cells produce CHI3L1 constitutively in culture; and thus, the effect may be pleiotropic. Some insight into possible physiological roles for CHI3L1 has been gained by the observation that this protein stimulates growth of connective tissue cells such as chondrocytes, synoviocytes, and skin fibroblasts (17Recklies A.D. White C. Ling H. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 18De Ceuninck F. Gaufillier S. Bonnaud A. Sabatini M. Lesur C. Pastoureau P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 926-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). CHI3L1 was reported to promote adhesion and migration of vascular endothelial cells (19Malinda K.M. Ponce L. Kleinman H.K. Shackelton L.M. Millis A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 20Nishikawa K.C. Millis A.J. Exp.

Pastoureau P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 926-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) also reported that CHI3L1 increases proteoglycan synthesis in guinea pig chondrocytes. In addition, CHI3L1 dampens the response of chondrocytes and synovial cells to the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 2The abbreviations used are: TNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αIL-1interleukin-1DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumRTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinasePI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseJAKJanus kinase. and interleukin-1 (IL-1), decreasing the production of matrix metalloproteases and chemokines (21Ling H. Recklies A.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that CHI3L1 may play a protective role in inflammatory environments, limiting degradation of the extracellular matrix and thus controlling tissue damage. However, increased levels of CHI3L1 may also contribute to the development of tissue fibrosis. tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin-1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium reverse transcription glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Janus kinase. In contrast to human articular chondrocytes, neonatal rat articular chondrocytes do not express CHI3L1 in primary culture. These cells therefore provide an ideal system to study the regulation of CHI3L1 expression. We report here that synthesis of CHI3L1 is induced in rat articular chondrocytes by the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1 and that this process is uniquely dependent on the activity of the transcription factor NF-κB. These results indicate that production of CHI3L1 is a component of the inflammatory response of articular chondrocytes. By feeding back to modulate the extent of the response of cells to such inflammatory cytokines, the regulated expression of CHI3L1 functions to limit the degradative response in connective tissue. Exogenous Factors, Plasmids, and Inhibitors—Cells and explants were treated with factors in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES. Recombinant human TNF-α, recombinant human IL-6 and its soluble receptor, and recombinant mouse epidermal growth factor were obtained from Sigma (Mississauga, Ontario). Recombinant rat IL-1β, recombinant human IL-1β, and human parathyroid hormone-(1–34) were purchased from Pierce, R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and Peptide Institute, Inc. (Louisville, KY), respectively. The vehicle for the cytokines and factors was phosphate-buffered saline and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada). A constitutively expressed construct of wild-type IκB (pSVK3-IκB) and a dominant-negative form of IκB (pSVK3-IκB-2NΔ4) were a generous gift from Dr. J. Hiscott (Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, McGill University) (22Algarte M. Nguyen H. Heylbroeck C. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2694-2702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specific antibody for IκB was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Mouse anti-human NF-κB p65 and p50 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Radiolabeled [32P]CTP was obtained from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH), and the 3′-end labeling kits were from Amersham Biosciences (Montreal). In some experiments, pharmacologic inhibitors were used to selectively block individual signaling pathways. AG490, BAY 11-7085, BAY 11-7082, bisindolylmaleimide I, cyclosporin A, FK506, lactacystin, LY294002, PD98059, wortmannin, SN50, and inactive analogs of bisindolylmaleimide I (bisindolylmaleimide V) and U0126 (U0124) were purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). U0126 was obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Cell Cultures—Chondrocytes were harvested from the distal femoral condyles of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (23Séguin C.A. Bernier S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 356-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Typically, 8–12 × 105 cells were obtained per condyle. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, and 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at 450–550 cells/mm2 in 60-mm dishes (BD Biosciences, Mississauga). The medium was changed every 3 days and was replaced with serum-free medium 1 day prior to experiments except where indicated. All experiments were carried out on either primary or first passage cultures that retained expression of chondrocytic phenotypic markers. Fibroblast cultures were established by placing minced fragments of neonatal rat skin in culture dishes to allow outgrowth of fibroblasts, which occurs within a couple of days. Osteoblasts were prepared by timed sequential collagenase digestions of neonatal rat calvaria (24Bellows C.G. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N. Antosz M.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Fractions 2/3 and 4/5 represent early and late stage osteoblasts, respectively. Skin fibroblasts and osteoblasts were seeded at 500 cells/mm2 and allowed to expand to near confluence before exposure to cytokines. Rat femoral heads were used for explant culture of intact articular cartilage. They were dissected clear of the ligamentum teres, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin, and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Human juvenile chondrocytes had been prepared previously from knee cartilage obtained at autopsy (6Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained as frozen stocks after one passage. The cells were revived and expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. For expression studies, trypsinized cells were plated at 500 cells/mm2 and allowed to adhere for 48 h in serum-containing medium unless indicated otherwise. The human chondrocytes used in this study were between passages 3 and 5. Although type I collagen mRNA transcripts could be detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, the cells still expressed mRNA for type II collagen and aggrecan, indicating that they retained a chondrocytic phenotype. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Confluent cultures were serum-deprived for 24 h prior to addition of exogenous factors in the presence or absence of pharmacologic inhibitors. Total RNA was collected from cells after 24 or 48 h using the acid/guanidium/phenol/chloroform extraction method (TRIzol, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Levels of CHI3L1 transcripts were analyzed by RT-PCR using oligonucleotides CGCCCTCGACCATTCCCTGTGCACC (upstream primer) and TGTCCTGCTGGCCTCGGAAGAGG (downstream primer), giving rise to a 550-bp amplification product. Levels of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcripts were evaluated as housekeeping gene using upstream primer GCAGCCCAGAACATCATCCCTGCA and downstream primer CATTGTCATACCAGGAAATGAGCTT, resulting in a 350-bp amplification product. For analysis of rat MMP-13, oligonucleotides CTGCACCCTCAGCAGGTTGA and CTCATAGACAGCATCTACTTTGTC were used for upstream and downstream priming, respectively, resulting in a 372-bp amplification product. Expression of GRO-1 was assessed using upstream primer GGCAGGGATTCACTTCAAGA and downstream primer GCCATCGGTGCAATCTATCT, giving rise to a 205-bp product. All primers were synthesized in the Biotechnology Core Facility of the Shriners Hospital for Children. All primers were designed for a melting temperature of ∼60 °C to allow parallel amplification of different primer sets. RNA prepared from involuting rat mammary gland was used as a positive control for RT-PCR amplification of CHI3L1 because it is expressed at high levels in corresponding mouse tissue (25Morrison B.W. Leder P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3417-3426PubMed Google Scholar). Mammary glands from lactating rats were harvested from dams with litters, used by Dr. Lee (Shriners Hospital for Children, Montreal, Canada) in a study requiring harvesting of neonatal rat bones. Mammary gland tissue was collected when no pups remained, and the dams were killed. RNA was prepared from the tissue as described above. Collection and Analysis of Conditioned Culture Media—Confluent cultures of chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts or explant cultures of three femoral heads/well were serum-deprived for 24 h prior to addition of exogenous factors in the presence or absence of pharmacologic inhibitors. Culture media were collected after 24 or 48 h, and proteins were precipitated overnight by addition of 2 volumes of cold acetone. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation. Pellets were redissolved in 0.1 volume of SDS sample buffer unless indicated otherwise, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody recognizing rat CHI3L1 prepared as described below. For detection of human CHI3L1, a polyclonal antibody raised against the purified protein was used as described previously (6Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody dilution was 1:1000 unless stated otherwise. For detection of rat CHI3L1, a polyclonal antibody was prepared using the C-terminal peptide sequence CGGKEALAVA. The N-terminal sequence CGG was added to provide a linker for coupling to ovalbumin for immunization. All peptides were synthesized and purified in the Biotechnology Core Facility at the Shriners Hospital for Children. The antiserum was shown by Western blotting to be specific for rat CHI3L1; it did not react with the human or murine protein. The reactivity could be absorbed with the unconjugated peptide used for immunization, but not with C-terminal peptides based on the human and murine sequences. This antiserum was used for all Western blot analysis at 1000-fold dilution. Bound immunoglobulin was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfé, Quebec). To identify the protein species, bands were excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to peptide fragmentation and analysis by mass spectrometry, performed at Génome Québec (Montreal). Transfection of Human Chondrocytes with IκB Constructs—The plasmids pSVK3-IκB, pSVK3-IκB-2NΔ4, and pCMVS-EGFP were transfected into human articular chondrocytes using Magnetofection™ (OZ Biosciences, Marseilles, France) to enhance transfection efficiency. Chondrocytes (5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well plates and allowed to attach for 48 h in the presence of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cell layers were washed three times with serum-free DMEM to remove residual serum components. 2.5 μg of freshly purified DNA (using a plasmid purification kit, Promega Corp.) was added to 0.2 ml of DMEM, followed by 2 μl of PolyMag II transfection reagent (OZ Biosciences). This mixture was added to 0.5 ml of DMEM covering the cell layer, and the plates were exposed to a magnetic field for 10 min at room temperature, followed by an additional 6-h incubation at 37 °C. The medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, and the cells were allowed to recover overnight. To determine levels of synthesis and secretion of CHI3L1, the cells were exposed to serum-free medium for 24 h. Responsiveness to TNF-α was determined by addition of 30 ng/ml TNF-α during the last 30 min of the culture period. Cell layers were harvested and analyzed for the presence of CHI3L1 and IκB by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Stimulation with TNF-α is expected to result in decreased cytoplasmic levels of IκB. The culture medium was collected at the end of the incubation period and prepared as described above for analysis of secreted CHI3L1. Analysis of NF-κB Binding to the Human CHI3L1 Promoter—Confluent human chondrocytes were treated with TNF-α (50 ng/ml) or IL-1β (10 ng/ml) in serum-free medium for 30 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed for NF-κB binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described by Sakai et al. (26Sakai T. Kambe F. Mitsuyama H. Ishiguro N. Kurokouchi K. Takigawa M. Iwata H. Seo H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1272-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested with lysis buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.25% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium vanadate)). After centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the nuclear pellets were washed once with 0.5 ml of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in an equal volume of lysis buffer B (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 420 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2% (v/v) glycerol). Protein content was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Mississauga). Aliquots containing 10 μg of protein were incubated in the presence of 1 μm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors as described above with 32P-labeled DNA fragments corresponding to positions -571 to -702 of the human CHI3L1 promoter (27Rehli M. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Genomics. 1997; 43: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The fragments were generated by PCR and 3′-end-labeled following the manufacturer's instructions. In control experiments, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled DNA fragment was added. Binding specificity was also investigated using a DNA fragment with a C-to-G substitution in the consensus sequence GGGAATTTCCC of the NF-κB/Rel DNA-binding motif at the underlined position. This fragment was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the overlap extension method (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). To identify NF-κB subunits, a supershift analysis was performed by adding 1 μg of anti-human NF-κB p65 or p50 antibody or an unrelated IgG to the incubation mixtures. All samples were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C and analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% (w/v) native polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed overnight to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) at -80 °C. Induction and Secretion of CHI3L1 from Isolated Rat Articular Chondrocytes—Synthesis and secretion of CHI3L1 are detectable almost immediately following isolation of human articular chondrocytes (6Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25803-25810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, upon screening a large number of cellular RNA preparations from primary neonatal rat chondrocytes, no evidence for its presence was detected. However, neonatal rat chondrocytes are responsive to various pro-inflammatory cytokines. As CHI3L1 is often found in inflammatory environments, neonatal rat chondrocytes therefore provide an excellent model system in which to characterize induction of CHI3L1 production by cytokines. Rat chondrocytes were treated with factors associated with inflammation (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and epidermal growth factor) or with a factor involved in cartilage development (parathyroid hormone). Of the cytokines tested, only TNF-α and IL-1β induced mRNA expression for CHI3L1 (Fig. 1A). IL-6 in the presence of its soluble receptor (parathyroid hormone) and epidermal growth factor at concentrations known to elicit cellular responses in these cells were not effective in increasing CHI3L1 transcript levels (data not shown). CHI3L1 mRNA was clearly detectable 24 h after addition of TNF-α, and levels remained elevated at 48 h, indicating that this is not a transient phenomenon. Low levels of CHI3L1 transcripts were detectable in cultures maintained for 48 h in serum-free medium. TNF-α and IL-1β also induced CHI3L1 expression in osteoblast cultures (prepared from neonatal rat calvaria) at both early and late stages of differentiation (Fig. 1B), but not in neonatal rat skin fibroblasts (Fig. 1C). Levels of transcripts for both MMP-13 and the chemokine GRO-1 (the rodent equivalent of IL-8), known targets of TNF-α and IL-1β, were increased following exposure to the cytokines, indicating that the lack of CHI3L1 induction is not a consequence of a lack of response of the fibroblasts to either TNF-α or IL-1β. To determine whether the stimulatory effect of TNF-α and IL-1 at the gene level translates to increased secretion of CHI3L1 protein, an antibody was raised against the C-terminal peptide of rat CHI3L1. This antibody detected a protein doublet migrating at ∼39 kDa in the culture medium from cells stimulated with TNF-α or IL-1β, but not in control medium (Fig. 2, A and B). The immune reactivity could be absorbed with the immunizing peptide, but not with similar peptides from the C terminus of either mouse or human CHI3L1 (data not shown). In addition, analysis by peptide fragmentation and mass spectrometry indicated that both bands were indeed rat CHI3L1. The lower molecular mass band may represent a glycosylation variant or an unglycosylated form of the protein. Based on these observations, the question arose as to whether or not CHI3L1 secretion could be induced in intact cartilage. Femoral heads from neonatal rats consisting mainly of epiphyseal and articular cartilage were harvested and cultured in the presence or absence of cytokines. Culture media were analyzed for secreted CHI3L1 by Western blotting (Fig. 2C). As was observed for the isolated cells, no protein was detectable at 24 or 48 h in control cultures. Both TNF-α and IL-1β induced production of the protein in femoral heads, and secretion was maintained over a 48-h culture period. Thus, the capacity of cytokines to initiate synthesis of CHI3L1 did not result from removal of the chondrocytes from their intact tissue environment, but is an inherent response of these cells in their native environment. Short Exposure to Cytokines Is Sufficient for Prolonged CHI3L1 Production—As we have previously found that short exposures of chondrocytes to TNF-α (1–4 h) result in persistent activation of NF-κB signaling pathways and reduction of type II collagen and link protein synthesis in rat chondrocytes (23Séguin C.A. Bernier S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 356-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the requirement for the continued presence of cytokines with respect to CHI3L1 production was investigated. Isolated rat chondrocytes were exposed to TNF-α for 4 h, followed by removal of the cytokine and continuation of culture in unsupplemented medium. Cells were harvested at 24, 48, or 72 h and analyzed for the presence of CHI3L1 mRNA by RT-PCR (Fig. 3A). Elevated transcript levels were evident up to 72 h after removal of the cytokine. Similarly, CHI3L1 protein levels increased between 48 and 72 h (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the cells continued to secrete the protein. CHI3L1 synthesis was induced after only 1 h of exposure to cytokines, as reflected by the presence of the protein in the culture medium harvested 24 h after cytokine removal, and the increased production was maintained for at least 48 h (Fig. 3C). To facilitate detection of CHI3L1 protein, media were concentrated 20-fold for this series of experiments. Similar results were obtained for IL-1β, although this cytokine appeared less efficient after a 1-h exposure compared with TNF-α, with which the amount of secreted protein appeared similar after 1- and 4-h exposures (given the quantitative limitations of the method of analysis). Low levels of CHI3L1 protein were detectable in the control culture medium from untreated cells at 48 h, but not at 24 h, consistent with induction of mRNA (Fig. 3A). These results demonstrate that a short pulse of cytokine exposure induces a long-term eff"

https://openalex.org/W2162225090,"Localization and activation of heterotrimeric G proteins have a crucial role during asymmetric cell division. The asymmetric division of the Drosophila sensory precursor cell (pl) is polarized along the antero-posterior axis by Frizzled signalling and, during this division, activation of Galphai depends on Partner of Inscuteable (Pins). We establish here that Ric-8, which belongs to a family of guanine nucleotide-exchange factors for Galphai, regulates cortical localization of the subunits Galphai and Gbeta13F. Ric-8, Galphai and Pins are not necessary for the control of the anteroposterior orientation of the mitotic spindle during pl cell division downstream of Frizzled signalling, but they are required for maintainance of the spindle within the plane of the epithelium. On the contrary, Frizzled signalling orients the spindle along the antero-posterior axis but also tilts it along the apico-basal axis. Thus, Frizzled and heterotrimeric G-protein signalling act in opposition to ensure that the spindle aligns both in the plane of the epithelium and along the tissue polarity axis."

https://openalex.org/W2024046612,"A growing body of evidence supports the notion that soluble oligomeric forms of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) may be the proximate effectors of neuronal injuries and death in the early stages of Alzheimer disease. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with neuronal apoptosis induced by soluble Aβ remain to be elucidated. We recently demonstrated the involvement of an early reactive oxygen species-dependent perturbation of the microtubule network (Sponne, I., Fifre, A., Drouet, B., Klein, C., Koziel, V., Pincon-Raymond, M., Olivier, J.-L., Chambaz, J., and Pillot, T. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 3437–3445). Because microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are responsible for the polymerization, stabilization, and dynamics of the microtubule network, we investigated whether MAPs might represent the intracellular targets that would enable us to explain the microtubule perturbation involved in soluble Aβ-mediated neuronal apoptosis. The data presented here show that soluble Aβ oligomers induce a time-dependent degradation of MAP1A, MAP1B, and MAP2 involving a perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis with subsequent calpain activation that, on its own, is sufficient to induce the proteolysis of isoforms MAP2a, MAP2b, and MAP2c. In contrast, MAP1A and MAP1B sequential proteolysis results from the Aβ-mediated activation of caspase-3 and calpain. The prevention of MAP1A, MAP1B, and MAP2 proteolysis by antioxidants highlights the early reactive oxygen species generation in the perturbation of the microtubule network induced by soluble Aβ. These data clearly demonstrate the impact of cytoskeletal perturbations on soluble Aβ-mediated cell death and support the notion of microtubule-stabilizing agents as effective Alzheimer disease drugs.

Microtubules are polymers of α- and β-tubulin dimers that mediate many functions in neurons, including organelle transport and cell shape establishment and maintenance as well as axonal elongation and growth cone steering in neurons. The polymerization, stabilization, and dynamic properties of microtubules are influenced by interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). 3The abbreviations used are: MAPmicrotubule-associated proteinNFTsneurofibrillary tanglesADAlzheimer diseasePHFspaired helical filamentsAβamyloid β-peptideAMC7-amido-4-methylcoumarinfmkfluoromethyl ketoneMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolePBSphosphate-buffered salineTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. Members of this protein family are classified by size: high molecular mass proteins (MAP1A, MAP1B, MAP2a, and MAP2b) and intermediate molecular mass proteins (MAP2c, MAP2d, and tau) (1Gonzalez-Billault C.

Numerous studies have shown that neuronal apoptotic cell death involves alterations of the microtubule network consequent to calpain and effector caspase activation (4Chan S.L. Mattson M.P. J.

These calcium-dependent proteases are responsible for the degradation and turnover of a broad repertoire of MAP substrates, some of which they share, such as αII-spectrin and tau, and some of which are specific, as is the case of calpain-degraded MAP1B and MAP2. microtubule-associated protein neurofibrillary tangles Alzheimer disease paired helical filaments amyloid β-peptide 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin fluoromethyl ketone 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole phosphate-buffered saline tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. Intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are one of the histopathological hallmarks in brains of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (AD), a progressive dementia that manifests primarily as a profound inability to form new memories. These NFTs are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau organized into paired helical filaments (PHFs) (6Kosik K.S. Joachim C.L. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4044-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). In addition, AD is also associated with the presence of extracellular senile plaques (7Dickson D.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 321-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) formed as a consequence of the gradual accumulation and aggregation of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) into fibrils (8Wilquet V. De Strooper B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Despite evidence that Aβ represents a key factor in AD (9Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar), the nature of the toxic form of Aβ involved early in AD pathology remains to be determined. The issue of which pool (soluble or aggregated) of Aβ in brain is more deleterious in the early stages of AD is still controversial (10Drouet B. Pincon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. Pillot T. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, clinicopathological hallmarks of AD correlate far better with the soluble pool of Aβ (11McLean C.A. Cherny R.A.

Moreover, several studies in transgenic mice have indicated that specific cognitive deficits, neurodegeneration, and synaptic loss might occur before any histologically detectable formation of senile plaques (13Hsia A.Y.

Res. 2002; 69: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that the selective neuronal cell death in AD involves activation of caspases, which critically participate in apoptosis through the initiation of intracellular pathways and the proteolytic cleavage of several target proteins responsible for the typical morphological changes of apoptosis (24Dickson D.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25Cribbs D.H. Poon W.W. Rissman R.A. Blurton-Jones M. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 353-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, some experimental studies report the presence of activated forms of caspases and the accumulation of caspase-derived products in post-mortem AD brain tissue, similar to what has been observed in in vitro models of Aβ neurotoxicity (26Rohn T.T.

U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). In addition, there is considerable evidence that an increased activity of calpain associated with impaired calcium homeostasis (29Mattson M.P. Chan S.L. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 30LaFerla F.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 862-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) may be involved in AD development (31Nixon R.A. Ageing Res. Rev. 2003; 2: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 32Vanderklish P.W. Bahr B.A. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2000; 81: 323-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A region-specific increase in calpain activity has been demonstrated in the early stages of AD development, even before synaptic loss, neuronal degeneration, and tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation (33Saito K. Elce J.S. Hamos J.E. Nixon R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2628-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Moreover, in AD brain, the active form of calpain co-localizes with NFTs, senile plaques, and neuropil threads (34Grynspan F. Griffin W.R. Cataldo A. Katayama S. Nixon R.A. Brain Res. 1997; 763: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), just like MAP1B and MAP2 (35Kosik K.S. Duffy L.K. Dowling M.M. Abraham C. McCluskey A. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7941-7945Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 36Takahashi H. Hirokawa K. Ando S. Obata K. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 81: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which supports the capacity of MAP2 to form structures resembling PHFs via its microtubule-binding region (37DeTure M.A. Zhang E.Y. Bubb M.R. Purich D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32702-32706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, MAP1 and MAP2 or their proteolytic products have been suggested to act as effectors of cell death in AD (1Gonzalez-Billault C. Jimenez-Mateos E.M. Caceres A. Diaz-Nido J. Wandosell F. Avila J. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 48-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 38Uchida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 366-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest the early involvement of caspases and calpains in the cytoskeletal disorganization and degeneration of neurons in AD (39Nixon R.A. Saito K.I. Grynspan F. Griffin W.R. Katayama S. Honda T. Mohan P.S. Shea T.B. Beermann M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 747: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that soluble Aβ oligomers induce neuronal apoptosis by biphasic modification of plasma membrane fluidity, leading to perturbation of the microtubule network that is dependent on the induction of early oxidative stress (17Sponne I. Fifre A. Drouet B. Klein C. Koziel V. Pincon-Raymond M. Olivier J.-L. Chambaz J. Pillot T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3437-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that MAP modifications could be involved in the microtubule perturbation induced by soluble Aβ oligomers. The data presented here establish for the first time that calpain- and/or caspase-3-dependent proteolysis of MAP1A, MAP1B, and MAP2 could be a critical event involved in the microtubule disorganization and subsequent apoptosis induced by soluble Aβ in cortical neurons. Materials—Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(1–42), Aβ-(40–1), caspase substrates (Ac-DEVD-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) and Ac-LEHD-AMC), and inhibitor peptides (benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (fmk), Ac-DEVD-fmk, and Ac-LEHD-chloromethyl ketone) were purchased from Bachem. Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) used in this study are synthetic peptides identical to the most predominant Aβ forms found in AD brains. Indeed, Aβ is a heterogeneous proteolytic fragment derived from sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by a variety of enzymes classically termed “secretases.” Initial cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by β-secretase is followed by γ-secretase processing to release either the predominant 40-amino acid-long species (referred to here as Aβ-(1–40)) or the slightly larger 42-amino acid-long variant (referred to here as Aβ-(1–42)) according to the cleavage site along the amyloid precursor protein primary sequence. Aβ-(40–1) is a synthetic peptide with the same amino acid composition and the reverse sequence of Aβ-(1–40). Aβ-(40–1) is widely used as a non-neurotoxic negative control. The LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity kit (catalog no. L-3224) and the calcium indicator Fluo-3/AM (catalog no. F-1242) were purchased from Molecular Probes. The calpain substrate (succinyl-LY-AMC) and inhibitors (MDL28170, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met) were purchased from Calbiochem. All polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., except mouse anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (MAB380, Chemicon International, Inc.) used in immunofluorescence studies and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody (Molecular Probes catalog no. A-11055). Unless otherwise indicated, materials used for cell culture were obtained from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were of high purity and were from Sigma. Neuronal Cell Culture Studies—Primary cultures of cerebral cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 15 C57BL/6J mouse fetuses as described previously (16Pillot T. Drouet B. Queille S. Labeur C. Vandekerchkhove J. Rosseneu M. Pincon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated cells were plated at 105 cells/cm2 in plastic dishes or on glass coverslips precoated overnight with poly-dl-ornithine (1.5 or 15 μg/ml, respectively). The cells were cultured in chemically defined Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 serum-free medium and supplemented with 500 nm insulin, 60 μm putrescine, 30 nm sodium selenite, 100 μm transferrin, 100 nm progesterone, and 0.1% (w/v) ovalbumin. Cultures were maintained at 35 °C in a humidified 6% CO2 atmosphere. After 6–7 days in vitro, the cell population was determined to be at least 95% neuronal by immunostaining as described previously (16Pillot T. Drouet B. Queille S. Labeur C. Vandekerchkhove J. Rosseneu M. Pincon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were treated at 6–7 days in vitro for the indicated times with soluble oligomers of Aβ-(1–40) prepared as described (16Pillot T. Drouet B. Queille S. Labeur C. Vandekerchkhove J. Rosseneu M. Pincon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Alternatively, neurons were preincubated with different inhibitors or Ca2+-chelating agent 2 h before and throughout the treatment with soluble Aβ oligomers. Neuronal Viability and Apoptosis—Cell viability was initially determined by morphological observation. Aβ neurotoxicity was also assessed quantitatively by monitoring the mitochondrial reduction activity using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described previously (16Pillot T. Drouet B. Queille S. Labeur C. Vandekerchkhove J. Rosseneu M. Pincon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The simultaneous determination of live and dead cells was achieved with the LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. To monitor apoptosis, cell nuclei were visualized using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The neuronal cells (grown on glass coverslips) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, incubated for 10 min at room temperature with DAPI (0.1 μg/ml), washed with PBS, mounted in Fluoprep (bioMérieux S. A.), and visualized using a Leitz Aristoplan microscope equipped for fluorescence with a Fluotar ×40/1.3 objective. Photographs were taken using a Nikon DXM1200 digital camera. To evaluate the percentage of apoptotic cells, five independent fields of the microscope were counted (∼200 cells) in three separate experiments, with three determinations in each experiment. Measurement of Caspase-like Proteolytic Activities—The caspase activities were measured by cleavage of the substrates Ac-DEVD-AMC and Ac-LEHD-AMC as described previously (17Sponne I. Fifre A. Drouet B. Klein C. Koziel V. Pincon-Raymond M. Olivier J.-L. Chambaz J. Pillot T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3437-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, at the indicated time points after Aβ treatment, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 20 min on ice in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each pepstatin and leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. After homogenization, the cells collected were then lysed by three cycles of freezing/thawing and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and the protein concentration was assayed using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Fifty μg of proteins were incubated for 2 h with substrates (100 μm) initially dissolved at 10 mm in Me2SO. The cleavage of the caspase substrates was monitored by fluorescence emission at 460 nm after excitation at 360 nm using a Fluostar microplate reader (BMG LABTECH GmbH). Measurement of Calpain-like Proteolytic Activity—The μ/m-calpain activity was measured by cleavage of the cyclic fluorogenic substrate succinyl-Leu-Tyr-AMC. Briefly, at the indicated time points following peptide treatment, cortical neurons were incubated for 1 h at 35°C in a humidified 6% CO2 atmosphere with 50 μm succinyl-LY-AMC. (The stock solution was 50 mm in Me2SO.) Following this, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution, and fluorescence was directly recorded on culture dishes using the Fluostar microplate reader with 360-nm excitation and 460-nm emission filters. Western Blot Analysis—Primary cortical neurons cultured under different conditions were washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then solubilized in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). After homogenization, the cells collected were lysed by three cycles of freezing/thawing and finally centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the BCA protein assay kit. Samples (10 μg) were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer, denatured by heating the mixture for 5 min at 100 °C, and then resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE. The proteins separated were transferred using a Mini Trans-Blot cell onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.), and the membranes were blocked for 2 h with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST buffer) containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in TBST buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin as follows: goat polyclonal antibodies against MAP1A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-8969; 1:500 dilution), MAP1B (catalog no. sc-8970; 1:500 dilution), the four isoforms MAP2a/MAP2b/MAP2c/MAP2d (catalog no. sc-12012; 1:500 dilution), αII-spectrin (catalog no. sc-7465; 1:500 dilution), the calpain regulatory subunit (catalog no. sc-7528; 1:500 dilution), and CPP32 (caspase-3; catalog no. sc-1225; 1:500 dilution) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against β-tubulin (catalog no. sc-12012; 1:1000 dilution). After being washed with TBST buffer, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated preadsorbed secondary antibodies (catalog numbers sc-2054, sc-2055, and sc-2056; 1:5000 dilution). Subsequently, immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence protocol (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). Quantity One software, associated with the VersaDoc imaging system (Model 1000, Bio-Rad), was used to quantify signals. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Concentration—The measurement of cytosolic calcium concentration is based on the property of Fluo-3/AM exhibiting a large increase in fluorescence intensity without an accompanying spectral shift when binding Ca2+. An increase in fluorescence emission therefore reflects enhanced intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Briefly, at the indicated times, treated cortical neurons were loaded with 5 μm Fluo-3/AM (initially dissolved at 1 mm in Me2SO) associated with Pluronic F-127 at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution, and fluorescence was directly recorded in culture dishes using the Fluostar microplate reader with 485-nm excitation and 530-nm emission filters. For cytosolic Ca2+ imaging, the neuronal cells were grown on glass coverslips and subjected to the same protocol as described above. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed again with PBS, mounted in Fluoprep, and visualized under fluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence Studies—Following treatment, neurons were fixed in PBS containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature under constant shaking with monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (1:500 dilution) or with goat polyclonal antibody against MAP1A (1:500 dilution), MAP1B (1:500 dilution), or MAP2 (1:500 dilution). After several washes with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number sc-2300; 1:300 dilution) or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody (1:1000 dilution), washed with PBS, labeled with DAPI as described above, and mounted in Fluoprep. The microtubules were visualized by fluorescence microscopy as described above. Electron Microscopy—Cortical neurons were fixed for 2 h at 4°C in 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde and 0.5% (w/v) tannic acid in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). The neurons were then post-fixed for 2 h at 4 °C in 2% (w/v) osmic acid in phosphate buffer. After being dehydrated in a graded alcohol series, the samples were embedded in Epon resin (Poly/Bed 812, Polysciences, Inc.), and ultrathin sections (70 nm) were obtained using a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome. Thin sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate prior to examination with a Jeol 100CX microscope. Statistical Analyses—StatView computer software was used for statistical analysis. Data are from three separate experiments, with four determinations in each experiment, and are normalized to the effect of vehicle (designated as 100%). Values are expressed as the means ± S.E. Differences between control and treated groups were analyzed using Student's t test. Multiple pairwise comparisons among the groups of data were performed using analysis of variance, followed by Scheffe's post hoc test. Statistical differences were determined at p < 0.05. The Western blot analysis results and fluorescent images shown are representative of at least three separate experiments. Soluble Oligomers of Aβ Are Toxic to Mouse Cortical Neurons—We first investigated the neurotoxicity of non-fibrillar Aβ-(1–40) using primary cultures prepared from mouse cortex. Neuronal cultures incubated for 24 h with 5 μm soluble Aβ oligomers exhibited hallmarks of degenerating neurons, such as neurite alteration (Fig. 1A). The neurotoxicity of soluble Aβ was also investigated using a two-color fluorescence cell viability assay. In contrast to intense and uniform green fluorescence based on intracellular esterase activity displayed by control neurons, cells exposed for 24 h to 5 μm Aβ were stained mainly with ethidium homodimer-1, producing a bright red fluorescence indicative of dead neurons (Fig. 1B). Incubation of mouse cortical neurons with Aβ resulted in a time- and dose-dependent decrease in cell viability as monitored using the MTT assay (Fig. 1D). A 48-h exposure of cortical neurons to 0.5 and 5 μm Aβ induced a reduction in viability relative to controls (23.4 ± 3.0% (p < 0.001) and 77.4 ± 0.6% (p < 0.001), respectively). The decrease in neuronal viability upon Aβ treatment was significant after a 12-h incubation (11.8 ± 2.4% (p < 0.001) relative to controls at 0.5 μm) (data not shown) and reached levels of 58.2 ± 1.4% (p < 0.001) and 77.4 ± 0.6% (p < 0.001) after 24 and 48 h of treatment, respectively (Fig. 1D). Additionally, morphological examination of neuron nuclei stained with DAPI showed that cortical neurons exposed to soluble Aβ presented typical apoptotic morphology, with condensation of chromatin and fragmentation of the nuclei (Fig. 1C). Indeed, cortical neurons exposed to 2 and 5 μm Aβ for 24 h exhibited a dose-dependent increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei (38.2 ± 3.1 and 61.7 ± 4.9%, respectively; p < 0.001), whereas only 8.9 ± 2.8% of the control cells exhibited apoptotic nuclei (data not shown). We therefore selected a range of exposure times with 5 μm soluble Aβ to study the perturbation of the microtubule network and the associated intracellular events in the early stage of Aβ-induced apoptosis. Soluble Oligomers of Aβ Induce Perturbation of Cellular Ca2+ Homeostasis—Cytosolic Ca2+ levels were first visualized using the fluorescent probe Fluo-3/AM. Labeling of control cells revealed weak cytoplasmic labeling, whereas cortical neurons exposed to 5 μm Aβ for 12 h exhibited increased fluorescence intensity, reflecting enhanced intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig. 2A). As a positive control, a dramatic rise in cytosolic Ca2+ levels was noted after a 5-min treatment of cortical neurons with the Ca2+ ion"
https://openalex.org/W1981860609,"γ-Secretase is a multimeric membrane protein complex comprised of presenilin (PS), nicastrin (Nct), Aph-1, and Pen-2. It is a member of an atypical class of aspartic proteases that hydrolyzes peptide bonds within the membrane. During the biosynthetic process of the γ-secretase complex, Nct and Aph-1 form a heterodimeric intermediate complex and bind to the C-terminal region of PS, serving as a stabilizing scaffold for the complex. Pen-2 is then recruited into this trimeric complex and triggers endoproteolysis of PS, conferring γ-secretase activity. Although the Pen-2 accumulation depends on PS, the binding partner of Pen-2 within the γ-secretase complex remains unknown. We reconstituted PS1 in Psen1/Psen2 deficient cells by expressing a series of PS1 mutants in which one of the N-terminal six transmembrane domains (TMDs) was swapped with those of CD4 (a type I transmembrane protein) or CLAC-P (a type II transmembrane protein). We report that the proximal two-thirds of TMD4 of PS1, including the conserved Trp-Asn-Phe sequence, are required for its interaction with Pen-2. Using a chimeric CD4 molecule harboring PS1 TMD4, we further demonstrate that the PS1 TMD4 bears a direct binding motif to Pen-2. Pen-2 may contribute to the activation of the γ-secretase complex by directly binding to the TMD4 of PS1. γ-Secretase is a multimeric membrane protein complex comprised of presenilin (PS), nicastrin (Nct), Aph-1, and Pen-2.

Missense mutations in PSEN (Presenilin, PS) 1 and 2 genes are linked to the early onset familial Alzheimer disease (FAD). FAD mutations lead to altered cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and overproduction of amyloid β peptides (Aβ) ending at position 42 (Aβ42). Aβ42 peptides are more prone to formation of amyloid deposits (2Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H. Nukina N. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). In contrast, ablation of Psen genes causes a complete loss of γ-secretase activity and thus cleavage of a set of type I transmembrane proteins (e.g. APP, Notch, ErbB4, and CD44). In addition to the beneficial loss of Aβ, failure to release Notch intracellular domain (NICD) causes lethality (3Huppert S.S. Le A. Schroeter E.H. Mumm J.S. Saxena M.T. Milner L.A. Kopan R.

Thus, PS-dependent γ-secretase mediates a novel mode of proteolysis-dependent signal transduction (4Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

However, the stoichiometric composition and the mechanism of assembly of the γ-secretase complex have remained elusive.

https://openalex.org/W2083578247,"Reactive oxygen species are produced as the direct result of aerobic metabolism and can cause damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. A principal defense against reactive oxygen species involves the superoxide dismutases (SOD) that act to detoxify superoxide anions. Activation of CuZn-SODs in eukaryotic cells occurs post-translationally and is generally dependent on the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS), which inserts the catalytic copper cofactor and catalyzes the oxidation of a conserved disulfide bond that is essential for activity. In contrast to other eukaryotes, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans does not contain an obvious CCS homologue, and we have found that the C. elegans intracellular CuZn-SODs (wSOD-1 and wSOD-5) are not dependent on CCS for activation when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. CCS-independent activation of CuZn-SODs is not unique to C. elegans; however, this is the first organism identified that appears to exclusively use this alternative pathway. As was found for mammalian SOD1, wSOD-1 exhibits a requirement for reduced glutathione in CCS-independent activation. Unexpectedly, wSOD-1 was inactive even in the presence of CCS when glutathione was depleted. Our investigation of the cysteine residues that form the disulfide bond in wSOD-1 suggests that the ability of wSODs to readily form this disulfide bond may be the key to obtaining high levels of activation through the CCS-independent pathway. Overall, these studies demonstrate that the CuZn-SODs of C. elegans have uniquely evolved to acquire copper without the copper chaperone and this may reflect the lifestyle of this organism."

To this end, we have dissected the modular structure of the maltohexaose-forming amylase from Bacillus halodurans (C-125). This five-module protein comprises an N-terminal family 13 catalytic module followed in order by two modules of unknown function, a family 26 CBM (BhCBM26), and a family 25 CBM (BhCBM25). Here we present a comprehensive structure-function analysis of starch and α-glucooligosaccharide recognition by BhCBM25 and BhCBM26 using UV methods, isothermal titration calorimetry, and x-ray crystallography. The results reveal that the two CBMs bind α-glucooligosaccharides, particularly those containing α-1,6 linkages, with different affinities but have similar abilities to bind granular starch. Notably, these CBMs appear to recognize the same binding sites in granular starch. The enhanced affinity of the tandem CBMs for granular starch is suggested to be the main biological advantage for this enzyme to contain two CBMs. Structural studies of the native and ligand-bound forms of BhCBM25 and BhCBM26 show a structurally conserved mode of ligand recognition but through non-sequence-conserved residues.

It is well established that carbohydrates play vital roles in numerous biological settings. They can act as the carriers of biological information, such as in cell development, carcinogenesis, immune response, and cell trafficking; as structural macromolecules, such as the cellulose of plant cell walls or chitin of insect exoskeletons; or as an energy source. Polysaccharides, which are a highly polymerized class of carbohydrates, can perform any of these functions. As mentioned, cellulose and chitin, the first and second most abundant biopolymers on earth, respectively, are the premier structural carbohydrates. Glycosaminoglycans are a highly complex class of polysaccharides that make up the extracellular glue of mammalian tissues and function both in structural and information content roles. Glycogen and starch are related polysaccharides that function as the primary storage carbohydrates in animals and plants, respectively. Glycogen is a polymer of glucose comprising linear α-1,4-linked glucose with α-1,6 branch points occurring approximately every 8-12 glucose residues. Amylopectin, a component of starch, is a glycogen-like molecule but with α-1,6 branch points occurring approximately every 24-30 glucose residues. Amylose, the other component of starch, is a polymer of pure linear α-1,4-linked glucose. The α-1,4 linkages in these polysaccharides make them fold into tight helical structures, resulting in dense granules that function as highly effective storage systems. The release of small metabolizable sugars from these polysaccharides is achieved by the action of glycoside hydrolases falling primarily into families 13 and 15 of the glycoside hydrolase classification (on the World Wide Web, see afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/). A remarkable feature of these enzymes is their modularity. Many of these enzymes have complex multimodular architectures comprising at least one catalytic module and often several ancillary modules. The most common class of ancillary module is the carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) 2The abbreviations used are: CBMcarbohydrate-binding moduleBhCBM25 and BhCBM26family 25 and 26 CBMs, respectively, from a B. halodurans maltohexaose-forming amylaseITCisothermal titration calorimetryOG-CBMOregon Green®-labeled CBMMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidSADsingle-anomalous dispersionGM363-α-d-glucosyl-maltotrioseGM3M363-α-d-glucosyl-maltotriose-maltotriose.

CBMs exert their biological activity by maintaining the interaction of the enzyme with its insoluble substrate (2Bolam D.N. Ciruela A. Mcqueen-Mason S. Simpson P. Williamson M.P. Rixon J.E. Boraston A. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This proximity/targeting effect raises the local concentration of enzyme, thereby increasing the rate of substrate hydrolysis. In the case of insoluble polysaccharide hydrolysis, including granular starch hydrolysis (3Sumitani J. Tottori T. Kawaguchi T. Arai M. Biochem.

CBMs are currently classified into 43 primary structure-based families (on the World Wide Web, see afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/), of which there are currently only six classified families of starch-binding CBMs: CBM families 20, 21, 25, 26, 34, and 41. The starch binding properties have only been thoroughly characterized for two starch-specific CBMs. The stoichiometry and thermodynamics of α-glucan binding as well as the influence of binding on the tertiary structure of starch have been examined for the family 20 CBM from the Aspergillus niger glucoamylase. NMR and thermodynamic studies by isothermal titration calorimetery (ITC) indicated that this module has two binding sites with approximately similar affinities for maltooligosaccharides (ranging from ∼6 × 102 m-1 for a triose to ∼3 × 103 m-1 for a pentaose) (7Sigurskjold B.W.

Structure. 1997; 5: 647-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Remarkably, studies have shown that the concerted action of these two binding sites results in the disruption of amylose structure (9Giardina T. Gunning A.P. Juge N. Faulds C.B. Furniss C.S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, the family 41 CBM from Thermotoga maritima Pul13 had only a single carbohydrate binding site on the protein, and the affinity of this module for maltooligosaccharides was substantially higher, in the range of 106 m-1 (11Lammerts van Bueren A. Finn R. Ausio J. Boraston A.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15633-15642Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Currently, of the starch-binding CBMs, only families 20 and 34 have representative structures. The solution NMR structure of the A. niger CBM20 was the first to be determined (12Sorimachi K. Jacks A.J. Le Gal-Coeffet M.F. Williamson G. Archer D.B. Williamson M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 970-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Subsequently, numerous CBM20s, many of these from Bacillus sp., have been solved by x-ray crystallography as part of the complete enzyme structures. The first family 34 CBM to have its structure solved by x-ray crystallography was the N-terminal CBM from Thermoactinomyces vulgaris TVAII (13Kamitori S. Kondo S. Okuyama K. Yokota T. Shimura Y. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 907-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This module was referred to as “domain N” until sometime later, when the structure of the complete enzyme in complex with maltooligosaccharides revealed two maltooligosaccharide molecules bound to this module. This, combined with functional analysis, revealed its role as a CBM (14Abe A. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. Kamitori S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The folds of CBMs in families 20 and 34 are very similar: a β-sandwich fold with an immunoglobulin-like topology. The structures of a number of intact (i.e. not truncated) starch active enzymes have been solved in complex with maltooligosaccharides. Occasionally, in these structures, sugars have been observed to be associated with modules not classified as CBMs. Although these may indeed be starch-specific CBMs, they remain unclassified until additional methods are used to demonstrate carbohydrate binding. The complex architecture of plant cell walls is elegantly reflected in the diversity of CBMs that recognize the individual polysaccharides and even subcomponents of the polysaccharides. Although starch does not have the diversity of composition that plant cell walls do, it is, nonetheless, a structurally complex polysaccharide whose recognition by CBMs in a broad sense is poorly studied. To better understand this phenomenon, we have engaged in structure-function studies of additional starch-specific CBM families in order to shed light on how the complex structure of starch may be recognized. Here we report the quantitative study of the interaction of family 25 and 26 CBMs, BhCBM25 and BhCBM26, respectively, from the Bacillus halodurans (C-125) maltohexaose-forming amylase with granular starch and soluble oligosaccharides. The three-dimensional structures of these CBMs solved by x-ray crystallography in complex with soluble maltooligosaccharides provide insight into the molecular determinants of these CBM-starch interactions. Carbohydrates and Polysaccharides—All carbohydrates and polysaccharides used in this study were purchased from Sigma. The granular starch discussed throughout was from corn. Cloning—The DNA fragments encoding the desired modules (see Fig. 1) of the maltohexaose-forming amylase gene (see GenBank™ accession number AP001508; open reading frame BH0413) were amplified by PCR from B. halodurans (C-125) genomic DNA (ATCC BAA-125) using previously described methods (15van Bueren A.L. Morland C. Gilbert H.J. Boraston A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 530-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used are shown in Table 1. The catalytic module, GH13CM, was amplified with the oligonucleotide pair GH13F and GH13R; the X23-1 module was amplified with X23AF and X23AR; the X23-2 module was amplified with X23BF and X23BR; the BhCBM26 module was amplified with CBM26F and CBM26R; and the BhCBM25 module was amplified with CBM25F and CBM25R. The BhCBM26/25 tandem was amplified with CBM26F and CBM25R. The PCR-amplified products were ligated into the pET-150 TOPO Directional Cloning kit (Invitrogen) to generate pCM, pX1, pX2, pCBM26, pCBM25, and pCBM26/25, respectively. The encoded polypeptides contained an N-terminal His6/V5 epitope tag and a TEV protease cleavage site.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers used to generate the constructs in this study Underline, NHEI restriction site; italics, HindIII restriction site; bold, stop codon.NameOligonucleotide sequenceGH13FCACCAATAGCGTTGATGCCTCTGH13RCTTTTAAATTAAAATGACACCATTX23AFCACCGAAAGGGCGGGAGACTTGX23ARCTTTTAGGCTGGAACCTTTGTAAAX23BFCACCTACCCGCAAGTTTTTGCTX23BRCTTTTACGTTGATTTCGTGTATGTCBM26FCACCGGGCTGACAATTTATTTTCBM26RCTTTTAAGGTCTATCAACATGCCACBM25FCACCGGGGACGCAACGGATATCCBM25RCTTTTACTTAGGAGTTCCACTTAACBM26NFCCATATGGCTAGCGGGCTGACAATTTATTTTCBM26HRGCGGCCGCAAGCTTTTAAGGTCTATCAACATGCCACBM25NFCCATATGGCTAGCGGGGACGCAACGGATATCCBM25HRGCGGCCGCAAGCTTTTACTTAGGAGTTCCACTTAA Open table in a new tab The BhCBM26 module and the BhCBM25 module were subsequently reamplified with the primer pairs CBM26NF/CBM26HR and CBM25NF/CBM25HR and cloned into NheI- and HindIII-digested pET28a to give pET28-BhCBM26 and pET28-BhCBM25, respectively. The encoded polypeptide contained an N-terminal His6 fused to the polypeptide via a thrombin cleavage sequence. These constructs were made in order to obtain recombinant protein production levels sufficient to purify protein for calorimetric and structural studies. Protein Production and Purification—Protein production and purification procedures were identical for pET-150 and pET-28 constructs, except that growth medium used for the latter was supplemented with 50 mg/liter kanamycin rather than 100 mg/liter ampicillin. All protein production was done in Escherichia coli BL21 STAR (DE3). Cultures were grown in LB medium supplemented with antibiotic to an approximate A600 of 0.8, and then expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.3 mm. Cells harvested by centrifugation were ruptured by passage through a French pressure cell. Recombinant protein was purified from clarified extracts by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography as described previously (16Boraston A.B. Creagh A.L. Alam M.M. Kormos J.M. Tomme P. Haynes C.A. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6240-6247Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Purified polypeptides were concentrated and exchanged into the appropriate buffer in a stirred ultrafiltration unit (Amicon, Beverly, MA) on a 5,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane (Filtron, Northborough, MA). Purity, assessed by SDS-PAGE, was greater than 95%. Protein Concentration Determination—The concentrations of purified proteins were determined by UV absorbance (280 nm) using calculated molar extinction coefficients (17Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Granular Starch Binding Studies—Adsorption isotherms using granular corn starch (at 10 mg/ml) were obtained and analyzed using methods described previously for cellulose (18McLean B.W. Boraston A.B.

BhCBM25 and BhCBM26 were labeled with Oregon Green® 514 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), which labels the amine groups of lysines and the N terminus. This was done according to the supplier's instructions. Free label was removed from the reaction by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations and degree of labeling were determined by UV-visible spectroscopy according to the supplier's instructions. Competition displacement assays were done essentially as described previously (19Boraston A.B. Kwan E. Chiu P. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6120-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A constant concentration of granular starch (50 mg/ml) was mixed with a constant concentration of Oregon Green®-labeled CBM (OG-CBM). Unbound OG-CBM at equilibrium was quantified by UV-visible spectroscopy at a wavelength of 511 nm, which corresponds to the absorbance maximum of Oregon Green® 514 (ϵ = 70,000 m-1 cm-1). Bound OG-CBM was calculated as the unbound OG-CBM subtracted from the total OG-CBM (total OG-CBM was measured in control samples, where the volume of starch suspension added was replaced by buffer). Samples assessing competition-displacement contained OG-CBM and one of the following competitors: 250 μm bovine serum albumin, 250 μm BhCBM25 (unlabeled), 300 μm BhCBM26 (unlabeled), or 500 μm maltotriose. Displacement and, therefore, binding competition was determined by the relative amount of bound OG-CBM in the absence of competitor with the relative amount of bound OG-CBM in the presence of competitor. All experiments were performed in duplicate. UV Difference Titrations—Automated UV difference titrations were performed as described previously (11Lammerts van Bueren A. Finn R. Ausio J. Boraston A.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15633-15642Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Difference spectra were examined for peak and trough wavelengths, and values at the appropriate wavelengths were extracted for further analysis. The peak-to-trough heights at the wavelength pairs 292.8/288.4 nm, 288.4/285 nm, and 285/277.6 nm for BhCBM25 and 294/288.8 nm, 288.8/285.8 nm, and 285.8/279 nm for BhCBM26 were calculated by subtraction of the trough values from the peak values and the dilution-corrected data plotted against total carbohydrate concentration. Data for the three wavelength pairs were analyzed simultaneously with MicroCal Origin (version 7.0) using a one-site binding model accounting for ligand depletion (20Boraston A.B. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14679-14685Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 20 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The data reported are the averages and S.D. values of three independent titrations. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC was performed as described previously (16Boraston A.B. Creagh A.L. Alam M.M. Kormos J.M. Tomme P. Haynes C.A. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6240-6247Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), using a VP-ITC (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 25 °C using 100-450 μm BhCBM25 or BhCBM26 in the reaction cell, which gave C values (21Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar) of >5, and 1-5 mm oligosaccharide in the syringe. Protein samples were extensively dialyzed against the buffer. Sugar solutions were prepared by mass in buffer saved from the final protein dialysis step. Both protein and sugar solutions were filtered and degassed immediately prior to use. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance as described above. All data show the average and S.D. of three independent titrations. Crystallization of BhCBM25 and BhCBM26—BhCBM25 and BhCBM26 were produced and purified from cultures of E. coli BL21 STAR (DE3) harboring pET28-BhCBM25 or pET28-BhCBM26. Both CBMs, previously exchanged into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, were treated overnight with thrombin at room temperature, concentrated, and buffer-exchanged into water in a 10-ml stirred ultrafiltration device using a 5,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane. All crystallizations were done by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. All computing was done using the CCP4 suite (22Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) unless otherwise stated. All crystals were frozen at 113 K after a short soak in artificial mother liquor supplemented with ethylene glycol at 20-25% (v/v). Diffraction data were collected with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ area detector coupled to an MM-002 x-ray generator with Osmic “blue” optics and an Oxford Cryo-stream 700. Data were processed using the Crystal Clear/d*trek (23Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The reaction was centrifuged to eliminate precipitated material, and excess N-iodosuccinimide was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 pre-equilibrated with water. Iodinated BhCBM25 at 24 mg/ml was crystallized in 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 10% isopropyl alcohol, and 20% polyethylene glycol 4000. Unmodified BhCBM25 at 30 mg/ml, preincubated with a 20-fold molar excess of maltotetraose, was crystallized in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 30% polyethylene glycol 4000. BhCBM25 at 15 mg/ml preincubated with an equimolar amount of maltotetraose crystallized in 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 30% polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether. BhCBM26 at 25 mg/ml preincubated with a 20-fold molar excess of maltose crystallized in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 30% polyethylene glycol 1500. A BhCBM26 complex with cadmium was obtained in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.01 m CdSO4, and 0.6 m sodium acetate using protein at 5 mg/ml. Phasing, Model Building, and Refinement—The structures of BhCBM25 and BhCBM26 were solved by single-anomalous dispersion (SAD) using iodinated and Cd2+ derivatives, respectively. Heavy atom sites in these derivatives were found using ShelxD (24Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) with data extending to 3.0 Å. Two strong iodine sites and a third weaker site were found in the BhCBM25 data. Refinement of heavy atom parameters and initial phasing with SHARP (25Evans G. Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 976-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using these three sites yielded an overall phasing power of 2.0 and a figure of merit of 0.35 for the full 1.39 Å resolution range. In the case of the BhCBM26 Cd2+ derivative, a highly redundant data set was collected that covered a sweep angle of 300 °C. This full set data was processed to 2.5 Å (Cd2+ redundant data set; Table 2) and was used to find four Cd2+ sites. A subset of the data between the oscillation angles of 47 and 128° was processed to 2.0 Å (Cd2+ 2.0 Å subset; Table 2) and was used for phasing, model building, and refinement. Refinement of heavy atom parameters and initial phasing with SHARP using these four Cd2+ sites yielded an overall phasing power of 0.9 and a figure of merit of 0.36 for the 2.0 Å resolution range. Density improvement was performed with DM (26Cowtan K.D. Zhang K.Y. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), which yielded a final correlation coefficient of 0.61 for BhCBM25 and 0.73 for BhCBM26. For both BhCBM25 and BhCBM26, the resulting electron density maps were readily interpretable, and initial models of ∼70-80% completeness were built by ARP/wARP (27Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). These initial models were corrected and completed manually by successive rounds of building using COOT (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar) and refinement with REFMAC (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). The coordinates of these refined BhCBM25 and BhCBM26 structures were used as molecular replacement models to solve the structures of their respective ligand-complexed forms. The models of the complexed forms were also corrected by successive rounds of building using COOT and refinement with REFMAC. Water molecules were added using the ARP/wARP option within REFMAC and inspected visually prior to deposition. In all data sets, 5% of the observations were flagged as “free” (30Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar) and used to monitor refinement procedures. All final model statistics are given in Table 2.

The specific mechanisms of Sec biosynthesis and insertion into protein in eukaryotic cells, however, are not known. Two proteins, SECp43 and the soluble liver antigen (SLA), were previously reported to interact with tRNA[Ser]Sec, but their functions remained elusive. Herein, we report that knockdown of SECp43 in NIH3T3 or TCMK-1 cells using RNA interference technology resulted in a reduction in the level of methylation at the 2′-hydroxylribosyl moiety in the wobble position (Um34) of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec, and consequently reduced glutathione peroxidase 1 expression. Double knockdown of SECp43 and SLA resulted in decreased selenoprotein expression. SECp43 formed a complex with Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec and SLA, and the targeted removal of one of these proteins affected the binding of the other to Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec. SECp43 was located primarily in the nucleus, whereas SLA was found in the cytoplasm. Co-transfection of both proteins resulted in the nuclear translocation of SLA suggesting that SECp43 may also promote shuttling of SLA and Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec between different cellular compartments. Taken together, these data establish the role of SECp43 and SLA in selenoprotein biosynthesis through interaction with tRNA[Ser]Sec in a multiprotein complex. The data also reveal a role of SECp43 in regulation of selenoprotein expression by affecting the synthesis of Um34 on tRNA[Ser]Sec and the intracellular location of SLA.

For example, the tRNA that specifically incorporates Sec into protein in response to Sec UGA codons has been characterized wherein the amino acid is biosynthesized on the tRNA following its aminoacylation with serine by seryl-tRNA synthetase (2Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Thus, Sec tRNA has been designated Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec. There are two species of this tRNA in mammalian cells that differ by a single methyl group on the ribosyl moiety at position 34 (designated Um34; Ref. 3Diamond A.M. Choi I.S. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. Pomerantz S.C. Cruz R. Steer C.J. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. McCloskey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14215-14223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The form that does not contain Um34 is 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm5U) and that containing Um34 is 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2′-O-methyluridine (mcm5Um). The two species appear to have different roles in protein synthesis, wherein mcm5Um is associated with the synthesis of stress-related selenoproteins (e.g. glutathione peroxidase 1 [GPx1]), and mcm5U is associated with the synthesis of house-keeping selenoproteins (e.g. thioredoxin reductases) (4Carlson B.A. Xu X.M.

A specialized stem-loop structure in the 3′-untranslated region of mammalian selenoprotein genes, designated the SEC insertion sequence (SECIS) element, was identified that accounted for UGA codon specificity in dictating Sec incorporation into protein (6Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The SECIS elements that have been identified in the 24 known selenoproteins in rodents and 25 known selenoproteins in humans (7Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar) fall into two classes that differ in the occurrence of a ministem that is adjacent to the apical loop of the structure (8Grundner-Culemann E. Martin G.W. II I Harney J.W. Berry M.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A SECIS-binding protein, designated SBP2, was purified from various mammalian sources including liver, testes, and hepatoma cells (9Copeland P.R. Driscoll D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25447-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and shown to be required along with the SECIS element in selenoprotein mRNA for Sec insertion into protein (10Copeland P.R. Fletcher J.E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Driscoll D.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Recently, a ribosomal protein, L30, was found to bind SECIS elements and to have a role in mediating Sec incorporation at the ribosomal level (11Chavatte L. Brown B.A. Driscoll D.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A specific elongation factor for Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec has also been characterized (12Fagegaltier D. Hubert N. Yamada K. Mizutani T. Carbon P. Krol A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 13Tujebajeva R.M. Copeland P.R. Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Harney J.W. Driscoll D.M. Hatfield D.L. Berry M.J. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and it recognizes only the selenocys-teinyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec form of the tRNA and not, for example, the seryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec form (13Tujebajeva R.M.

Additional factors that have a role in the biosynthesis of Sec and its insertion into protein in mammals are selenophosphate synthetases 1 (SPS1; Ref. 14Low S.C. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and 2 (SPS2) (15Guimaraes M.J. Peterson D. Vicari A. Cocks B.G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J.

These enzymes apparently are responsible for generating an active form of selenium for its utilization in Sec synthesis and/or possibly other selenium-requiring reactions. Interestingly, SPS2 is a selenoprotein and thus has been implicated in the autoregulation of selenoprotein synthesis (15Guimaraes M.J. Peterson D. Vicari A. Cocks B.G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Ferrick D.A. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Zlotnik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15086-15091Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). There are two other factors that also have been shown to be associated with Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec, SECp43 (16Ding F. Grabowski P.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the soluble liver antigen, SLA (17Gelpi C. Sontheimer E.J. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9739-9743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Protein overlay analysis provided evidence for the interaction of SECp43 with a 48-kDa protein in HeLa cytoplasmic extracts (16Ding F. Grabowski P.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas SLA was detected in patients with an autoimmune chronic hepatitis as an autoantibody that precipitated Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec from human cell extracts and recognized a 48-kDa protein (17Gelpi C. Sontheimer E.J. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9739-9743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the 48-kDa protein, the requirements of the SECp43 complex formation, and the roles of either SECp43 or SLA were not determined. Herein, we investigated the role of SECp43 and SLA using RNAi knockdown technology (18Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C.

The targeted knockdown of SECp43 resulted in the reduced formation of Um34 on Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec and affected selenoprotein expression in a similar manner as mice lacking or containing reduced levels of mcm5Um (4Carlson B.A. Xu X.M.

To target the knockdown of SLA, we generated a construct that contained five knockdown target sites in SLA mRNA, which resulted in dramatically reduced levels of this mRNA in transfected cells. Interestingly, transfection of cells with a construct encoding both SECp43 and SLA knockdown sequences had a much more pronounced effect on selenoprotein biosynthesis than either individual knockdown construct suggesting that, although both components likely have separate roles in selenoprotein synthesis, they also act in concert. In addition, we found that SLA forms a complex with SECp43 and Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec and found that SECp43 was located primarily in the nucleus, whereas SLA was in the cytoplasm. However, co-transfection of both protein genes resulted in the nuclear translocation of the SLA gene product suggesting that the roles of these two components are interdependent. Materials—75Selenium (specific activity 1000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from the Research Reactor Facility, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity ∼6000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Corporation, and [3H]serine (specific activity 29 Ci/mmol) and Hybond Nylon N+ membranes were from Amersham. NuPage 10% polyacrylamide gels, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, Superscript II reverse transcriptase, cell culture fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium, α-minimum essential medium, Lipofectamine 2000, TRIzol reagent, and Hygromycin B were purchased from Invitrogen. DNA polymerase I large Klenow fragment was obtained from New England BioLabs, pSilencer 2.0 U6 Hygro vector was from Ambion, the pTriEx-4 Hygro vector was from Novagen, and SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate was from Pierce. Anti-His-tag antibodies were purchased from Qiagen, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Sigma, and SLA antibodies, generated against the peptide, TFRGFMSHTNNYPC (amino acids 358-371 of human SLA), were prepared by Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc. (Woodbine, MD). pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-C3 vectors, green fluorescent protein (GFP) and blue fluorescent protein (BFP) were purchased from Clontech. A Storm Image system (Molecular Dynamics) was used to scan Phosphor screens. All other chemicals and reagents were obtained commercially and were commercial products of the highest grade available. Mammalian Cell Lines, Cell Culture, and Transfection—Mouse kidney (TCMK-1) and embryonic fibroblast (NIH3T3) cells were obtained from ATCC. Chinese hamster ovary AA8 (CHO) cells encoding 10 copies of the wild type mouse Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec transgene were obtained as given (22Moustafa M.E. Carlson B.A. El Saadani M.A. Kryukov G.V. Sun Q.A. Harney J.W. Hill K.E. Combs G.F. Feigenbaum L. Mansur D.B. Burk R.F. Berry M.J. Diamond A.M. Lee B.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3840-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 and TCMK-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and CHO cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium, and both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Media for cells grown in the presence of selenium were supplemented with 300 nm sodium selenite. Generation of SECp43 Expression and SECp43 and SLA siRNA Constructs—The SECp43 clone and antibodies to SECp43 were obtained as given (16Ding F. Grabowski P.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The SECp43 clone was amplified using PCR and cloned into the pTriEx-4 Hygro vector for SECp43 expression. The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pU6 vector used for expressing siRNA constructs was constructed using the pSilencer 2.1-U6 Hygro vector as the backbone. Changes were inserted into the vector as follows: 1) GC (positions 468-469) were changed to A making the U6 promoter more homologous to the corresponding wild type gene, 2) the EcoRI site was deleted at position 4110, and 3) XhoI and MfeI sites were added at positions 384 and 393, respectively. The latter two changes made it possible to insert multiple siRNA target sequences into the vector. The modified vector was designated as pU6-m4 Hygro. For knocking down SECp43 gene expression, five separate 19-nt sequences, 5′-TTATCCGAAACCGCCTCAC-3, 5′-GCCGAGAAGTGTTTGCATA-3′, 5′-TTGTGAAATTCACAGATGA-3′, 5′-GCAGTACCAGAACTACTAT-3′, and 5′-CCATGCAGACATATGAAGA-3′, were selected from within mouse SECp43 cDNA as being unique to this gene using the online service “siDESIGN” of Dharmacon Research, Inc. Oligonucleotides containing 19 nt of sense and 19 nt of complementary (antisense) sequences with an intervening AGAGAACTT loop were synthesized and inserted into the pU6-m4 Hygro vector according to the manufacture's instructions. The sequences of all five of SECp43 siRNA constructs were verified by sequencing. The five constructs and the negative control plasmids were separately transfected into NIH3T3 and TCMK-1 cells. After stabilizing the transfected cells with 0.8 mg/ml hygromycin, several colonies were selected from plates, and the SECp43 mRNA levels were determined by northern hybridization as described below. Based on mRNA levels, the best siRNA target sequence was identified as 5′-GCAGTACCAGAACTACTAT-3′, and its siRNA construct was used in subsequent experiments. For knocking down mouse SLA (designated MSLA) gene expression, five separate 19-24-nt sequences, 1) 5′-GCTTGCAGTCATGGATAGCAACAA-3, 2) 5′-GAAATATCACCGGATCGTCCAA-3′, 3) 5′-GCTCATCACCTTCCAATACGT-3′, 4) 5′-GTCAACAACGCTTATGGATTA-3′, and 5) 5′-GAACAGACTAGAGCAAGTG-3′, were selected from within MSLA cDNA as being unique to this gene using the online service siDESIGN of Dharmacon Research, Inc. Oligonucleotides containing between 19 and 24 nt of sense and 19 to 24 nt of complementary (antisense) sequences with an intervening AGAGAACUU loop were synthesized and inserted separately within the BamHI and HindIII cloning sites of the pU6-m4 Hygro vector. The sequences of all five of MSLA siRNA constructs were determined for confirmation. For combining the five siRNA transcription units, two of the constructs (encoding the second and fourth siRNA sequences shown above) were digested with EcoRI and XhoI to release the U6-siRNA units. Two additional constructs (encoding the first and third siRNA sequences shown above) were digested with MfeI and XhoI. The released second and fourth U6-siRNA unit fragments were purified and inserted separately into the digested first and third siRNA vectors. Then the first and the second U6-siRNA units were combined in tandem into one vector, whereas the third and the fourth U6-siRNA units were combined in tandem in another vector. Repeating the same procedure, all of the five U6-siRNA units were inserted into the same vector. The combined MSLA construct and the negative control plasmids were transfected into NIH3T3 and TCMK-1 cells. After stabilizing the transfected cells with 0.8 mg/ml hygromycin, MSLA mRNA levels were determined by northern blot hybridization as described below. To generate a double knockdown vector encoding the siRNA targeting site for SECp43 mRNA and the five targeting sites for MSLA, the MSLA siRNA construct was digested with EcoRI and XhoI to release the five MSLAU6-siRNA units as a single fragment. The multiple MSLAU6-siRNA fragment was then inserted into the SECp43 siRNA construct, which was initially digested with MfeI and XhoI. Labeling of Selenoproteins—Cultured cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline to remove exogenous selenium, suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 μCi/ml of 75Se added to the medium, and grown an additional 24 h before harvesting as described (4Carlson B.A. Xu X.M.

Cells were again washed in phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 1× SDS loading buffer, and electrophoresed on NuPage 10% polyacrylamide gels along with standard molecular weight markers to assess labeled selenoprotein sizes. The developed gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to Phosphor screens. The screens were then scanned using a Storm Image (PhosphorImager) system (4Carlson B.A. Xu X.M.

Northern Blot Analyses—Total RNA was isolated from various transfected cells using TRIzol reagent. Equal amounts (15 μg) from the different cells were loaded onto the gels, and the developed gels were transblotted onto a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled probe and analyzed with a PhosphorImager for northern blot analysis as given (4Carlson B.A. Xu X.M. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol.

The SECp43, MSLA, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes were generated by either PCR or reverse transcription-PCR using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and Universal Reference RNA (4Carlson B.A. Xu X.M.

To detect an array of mRNAs on the same membrane, membranes, after an initial probing for SECp43 mRNA, were stripped in boiling buffer (0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS), hybridized with a second probe, analyzed, stripped, hybridized with another probe, and analyzed, etc., using successively labeled MSLA, GPx1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes. Hybridized membranes were exposed to Phosphor screens, and the screens were then scanned using a Strom Image System (Molecular Dynamics). The density of GPx1 northern blotting bands were quantified using ImageQuant Version 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics). Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, and Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec Northern Blot Analyses—CHO or NIH3T3 cells (1 × 107) were harvested and suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1× TBS with 0.2% Triton X-100). Either 50 μl of anti-His-agarose or 5 μl of preimmune sera, anti-SLA sera, or anti-SECp43 antibody along with 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose were added to 500 μg of lysis proteins in 1 ml of lysis buffer. After binding at 4 °C overnight, the agarose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of 1× TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and suspended in 30 μl of 1× protein loading buffer (for Western blotting) or 1× TBE/urea loading buffer (for northern blotting). 10 μl were loaded onto gels for Western blotting or for Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec northern hybridization. Proteins obtained by immunoprecipitation (see above) or from 50 μg of proteins from SECp43 siRNA, MSLA siRNA, or SECp43/MSLA siRNA-transfected cell lysate and control cell lysate were electrophoresed on NuPage 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes containing proteins obtained by immunoprecipitation were then incubated with either mouse anti-His (1:2000 dilution), or rabbit-anti-human-SLA (1:250), whereas those containing cell lysates were incubated with rabbit-anti-mouse GPx1 (1:1000). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:30000) were then applied, and the membranes were washed with 0.1% TBS-T, incubated in SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate, and exposed to x-ray film as given (4Carlson B.A. Xu X.M.

Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec obtained by immunoprecipitation (see above) was electrophoresed on 15% TBE/urea polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond nylon membranes, and the membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec probe and analyzed with a PhosphorImager as above. Isolation, Aminoacylation, and Chromatography of tRNA—SECp43 siRNA-transfected and control-transfected NIH3T3 cells were grown in 75-cm2 plates either with 300 nm SeO32- or without selenium. After reaching 80-90% confluence, the cells were collected, and total tRNA was isolated from ∼1 g of cells as described (23Hatfield D. Lee B.J. Hampton L. Diamond A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Transfer RNA was aminoacylated with [3H]serine in the presence of 19 unlabeled amino acids and rabbit reticulocyte aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (24Hatfield D. Matthews C.R. Rice M. Biochim. Biophys.

Constructs for Subcellular Localization and Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy—GFP expression constructs were prepared using pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-C3 vectors, respectively. The coding region of mouse SECp43 was PCR-amplified from NIH3T3 cDNA with forward primer 5′-CCTAAGCTTATGGCGGCCAGCCTATGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCTGGATCCATCATAGCTGGGATCTCTG-3′ and cloned into the HindIII/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1. To generate SLA-GFP expression construct, the human sequence (accession number NM 153825) was PCR-amplified from HEK-293 cDNA with forward primer 5′-CCTGAATTCATGGACAGCAACAATTTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCGGTCGACCCTGAAGAAGCATCCTGGTATGTG-3′ (underlined, italicized sequences specific endonuclease restriction sites) and cloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pEGFP-N1. The human sequence (designated HSLA) was chosen because it shares 86.9% identity with its predicted mouse homolog (27Costa M. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Czaja A.J. Gelpi C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 121: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, C-terminal GFP fusion proteins were generated, correspondingly, using vector pEGFP-C3 for comparison. To study the co-localization of SECp43 and HSLA, the GFP sequence of SECp43-GFP was cut with BamHI/HpaI and replaced with BFP to generate a SECp43-BFP fusion protein. For fluorescence confocal microscopy, images were collected using an Olympus FluoView 500 laser scanning microscope (Melville, NY). Development of Multi-siRNA Constructs for Efficient Knockdown of SECp43 and MSLA mRNA Expression—Because SECp43 (16Ding F. Grabowski P.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and MSLA (17Gelpi C. Sontheimer E.J. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9739-9743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were previously implicated in binding Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec, we explored the possibility of whether these two proteins function in the same pathway, or possibly in concert, by knocking down their gene expression using RNAi technology. Constructs of the five 19-nt sequences selected for targeting knockdown of mouse SECp43 (see “Experimental Procedures”) were examined for their ability to reduce the mRNA level of this protein in NIH3T3 cells. The construct corresponding to nucleotides 594-612 within the coding sequence was the most effective of those examined and was sufficient for targeting the removal of SECp43 mRNA (comparative data not shown). This siRNA construct, which is designated SECp43 siRNA construct, was used in all subsequent experiments. When five distinct MSLA siRNA targets were assayed individually for their knockdown potential, they were unsuccessful in reducing mRNA levels more than 50-60% (data not shown). Therefore, we generated a construct that encoded all five of the RNAi sequences unique to the corresponding cDNA as described under “Experimenta"

Both activities are restored by exogenous coenzyme Q2. Respiration is also partially rescued by COQ2, COQ7, or COQ8/ABC1, when these genes are present in high copy. Unlike other coq mutants, all of which lack Q6, the coq10 mutant has near normal amounts of Q6 in mitochondria. Coq10p is widely distributed in bacteria and eukaryotes and is homologous to proteins of the “aromatic-rich protein family” Pfam03654 and to members of the START domain superfamily that have a hydrophobic tunnel implicated in binding lipophilic molecules such as cholesterol and polyketides. Analysis of coenzyme Q in polyhistidine-tagged Coq10p purified from mitochondria indicates the presence 0.032–0.034 mol of Q6/mol of protein. We propose that Coq10p is a Q6-binding protein and that in the coq10 mutant Q6 it is not able to act as an electron carrier, possibly because of improper localization.

We propose that Coq10p is a Q6-binding protein and that in the coq10 mutant Q6 it is not able to act as an electron carrier, possibly because of improper localization. Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) is an essential electron carrier of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Its main function is to accept electrons from the NADH- and succinate-coenzyme Q reductases and to donate them to the bc1 complex (1Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of coenzyme Q in eukaryotes occurs in mitochondria. The benzoquinone ring of coenzyme Q6 (Q6) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a polyprenyl side chain with six isoprenoid units (2Gloor U. Isler O. Morton R.A. Ruegg R. Wiss O. Helv. Chim.

In the present study we report a novel phenotype displayed by mutants with a deletion of reading frame YOL008W, which we have named COQ10. The coq10 mutant is similar to other coq mutants in which optimal oxidation of NADH and succinate by isolated mitochondria depends on addition of coenzyme Q2. Unlike the coq mutants, which lack Q6, the coq10 mutant reported here has nearly normal concentrations of Q6. The product of COQ10 is a hydrophobic protein located in the inner membrane of mitochondria. It is a member of the large Pfam03654 family of proteins (aromatic-rich protein family) (18Bateman A.

Based on the presence in Coq10p of this domain and the detection of Q6 in the purified protein, we propose that Coq10p is a Q6-binding protein, which functions in the delivery of Q6 to its proper location for electron transport.

Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 108 cells were transformed with 50 μg of the plasmid library by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (23Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). COQ10 was PCR amplified from yeast nuclear DNA with primers: 5′-cacacagaaagcttagaaatag and 5′-ggcaagcttatcctggatggcatgatc. The 1.3-kb fragment containing the COQ10 reading frame plus 700 bp of 5′ and 50 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence was digested with HindIII and cloned in YEp352. Disruption of COQ10—The COQ10 gene and ∼500 bp of upstream and downstream sequence was amplified with primers: 5′-ggcggatccttcatgattagctatagtacg and 5′-ggcggatccgtcctcccagtgttcatctgg. This fragment was digested with BamHI and cloned in pUC19 (24Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar). This plasmid was used to delete the COQ10 coding sequence with the two bidirectional primers 5′-ggcagatctccacggtatctttagccg and 5′-ggcagatcttccgtataatttcagataacaaagatc. The PCR product consisting of linear pUC19 plus the COQ10 flanking sequences was digested with BglII and ligated to a 1-kb BamHI fragment containing the yeast HIS3 gene (this fragment lacked the downstream PET56 gene). The linear BamHI fragment with the coq10::HIS3 allele was isolated from this plasmid and substituted for the wild type gene in W303-1A and W303-1B by the one-step gene replacement method (25Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). Construction of Hybrid COQ10 Genes Expressing Coq10p with a Carboxyl-terminal Polyhistidine Extension and of a trpE Fusion Protein for Coq10p Antibody Production—The two PCR primers 5′-ggcagatctatataaaatggttttgataataaggccc and 5′-ggcaagctttcagtgatggtgatgatggtgcggagagccttctttagaag were used to amplify COQ10 with a 18-nucleotide insertion between the last codon and the termination codon. The PCR amplified product was digested with a combination of BglII and HindIII and was cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of YEp352/GAL, a YEp352 (22Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) derivative with the URA3 selectable marker and the GAL10 inducible promoter immediately upstream of the multiple cloning sequence. This construct was used to transform the coq10 null mutant aW303ΔCOQ10, to yield aW303ΔCOQ10/ST13, which expressed the protein with six carboxyl-terminal histidines (Coq10p-his). The trpE/COQ10 hybrid gene was obtained by cloning a 600-bp KpnI-HindIII fragment containing all but the first 35 codons of COQ10 in pATH20 (26Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) so as to effect an in-frame fusion to E. coli trpE coding for the amino-terminal half of anthranilate synthase component I. A 57-kDa hybrid protein was isolated from E. coli transformed with the plasmid. The insoluble protein was dissociated in SDS and was partially purified on a Bio-Gel A-0.5 column (26Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and used to obtain a polyclonal antibody in rabbits. Construction of a Plasmid with the Human Homologue of COQ10— The human homologue of COQ10 was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-ggcgagctcatgaggtttctgacctcctgc and 5-ggcggatcctcaagtctggtgcacctc with the Image clone 5299314 serving as the template. The 627-bp product was digested with a combination of SacI and BamHI and cloned into pMGL4, a multicopy copy yeast/E. coli shuttle vector with the ADH1 promoter and terminator (Dr. K. M. Glerum, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada). Lipid Extraction and Quinone Identification by Reverse Phase HPLC with Electrochemical Quantification and Mass Spectrometry—Lipid extracts were prepared from 1 mg of yeast mitochondrial protein and quinones were detected and quantified by HPLC/ECD as described previously (4Johnson A.

The mitochondrial lipid extracts were also examined by flow injection analysis with atmospheric pressure ionization and MS/MS product ion spectra. Aliquots of 20–50 μl of extracted calibration curve samples or standards were passed directly into an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source (APCI, nebulizing gas, “zero”-grade air produced by a Zero Air Generator (Peak Scientific, Chicago, IL) at 100–200 μl/min, nebulizer 400–450 °C, orifice 50 volts) attached to a PerkinElmer Sciex (Thornhill, Canada) API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in the tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) mode (99.999% argon collision gas at an instrumental GCT setting of 200). Spectral data were collected by MS/MS methods (precursor or product scanning): Q6, [M + H]+ = 591.4. Authentic standards of Q6 (Sigma) were fragmented and used to confirm the identity of the ions. Miscellaneous Procedures—Standard methods were used for plasmid manipulations (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondria were prepared from cells grown in YPGal to early stationary phase by the method of Faye et al. (28Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) except that Zymolyase 20T (ICN Laboratories, Aurora, OH) instead of Glusulase was used to obtain spheroplasts. Spectral analyses of mitochondrial cytochromes and measurements of respiratory enzymes were performed as described previously (5Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BYΔCOQ10 and W303ΔCOQ10 Phenotype—BYΔCOQ10 is a respiratory deficient mutant of the Genome Deletion Strain Collection. It was made by replacing reading frame YOL008W/COQ10 with the kanamycin-resistance cassette in strain BY4741. aW303ΔCOQ10 and W303ΔCOQ10 were obtained by replacing YOL008W with HIS3 in the wild type haploid W303-1A and W303-1B, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). The respiratory defect of both mutants is complemented by crosses to a ρo tester indicating that null mutations in this gene are recessive. In rich glucose medium, an early stationary culture of W303ΔCOQ10 consists of ∼50% ρo/– derivatives. On selective medium (YPEG) the mutant spontaneously reverts as a result of mutations in nuclear DNA. Unlike most coq mutants, which show a complete growth defect on glycerol/ethanol (5Tzagoloff A.

Addition of Q6 to growth medium has been shown to promote growth of coq mutants on non-fermentable carbon sources (12Do T.Q. Hsu A.Y. Jonassen T. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18161-18168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This is confirmed by the partial rescue of the coq5 and coq9 mutants in media supplemented with Q6. The generation time of aW303ΔCOQ10 is reduced to 8.5 h in media supplemented with Q6 (TABLE TWO).TABLE TWOGrowth properties of coq mutantsStrainGeneration time (hs)-Q6+Q62 μm15 μmW303-1A3.13.43aW303ΔCOQ5>4414.310.5aW303ΔCOQ9>4415N.D.aW303ΔCOQ1011.88.68.5 Open table in a new tab Spectra of W303ΔCOQ10 mitochondria show decreased concentrations of “a” and “b” type cytochromes (Fig. 1A). Some of the decrease, however, is because of the large proportion (50%) of ρo/– mutants in the culture. The tendency of nuclear pet mutants to accumulate large deletions in mitochondrial DNA is common when the mutations are in genes coding for components of the mitochondrial translation machinery (32Myers A.M. Pape L.K. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In vivo assays of mitochondrial protein synthesis in the coq10 null mutant revealed a normal pattern of mitochondrial translation products indicating that the excessive loss of the wild type mitochondrial genome was not caused by a defect in this translation system (Fig. 1B). The somewhat lower incorporation of [35S]methionine in the mutant is consistent with the percentage of ρo/– cells in the cultures used for the assays. The reductions of cytochromes a, a3, and b in the coq10 null mutant is also evident in the lower NADH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome oxidase activities of mutant mitochondria (TABLE THREE). In both mutants examined, the NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity was ∼10% of that measured in wild type even though cytochrome oxidase was reduced by only 40%. The lesion, therefore, was likely to be in a component of the respiratory chain preceding cytochrome oxidase. This activity was confirmed by the observation that the NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity of the coq10 mutants could be restored to ∼50% of the wild type by addition of exogenous coenzyme Q2 to the assay (TABLE THREE). The Q2 dependent activity is commensurate with complete restoration of NADH-cytochrome c reductase because half of the culture used for the preparation of mitochondria consisted of ρo/– mutants and therefore lacked the bc1 complex. Coenzyme Q2 also restored NADH and succinate oxidation in mitochondria of the coq10 mutant (Fig. 2). Measurements of NADH oxidase activity as a function of Q2 added to the assay indicated that the response of the coq10 mutant was similar to another mutant (coq9) that lacks Q6 (Fig. 3).TABLE THREENADH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome oxidase activities of mitochondriaStrainMicromoles of cytochrome c oxidized or reduced per min/mg of proteinNADH-cytochrome c reductaseCytochrome oxidase-Coenzyme Q2+Coenzyme Q2W303-1B2.27 ± 0.062.29 ± 0.012.45 ± 0.13W303ΔCOQ100.26 ± 0.001.16 ± 0.021.52 ± 0.01BYΔCOQ100.22 ± 0.021.36 ± 0.011.46 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3NADH oxidase activity of the coq10 mutant and of a mutant strain lacking Q6 as a function of Q2 in the assay.

Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of Q6 in the mutant was determined by HPLC separation and quantification of mitochondrial lipid extracts on a reverse phase column with an electrochemical detector set for optimal detection of Q6. Samples were analyzed against authentic standards of known concentration. The HPLC-ECD elution profile indicated the presence of a redox-active compound with a retention time consistent with that of coenzyme Q6 (Fig. 4). The identity of this compound as Q6 was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 5), which revealed the presence in lipid extracts of the wild type and coq10 null mutant of the correct molecular ion with a mass/charge ratio (m/z) of Q6 at 591.4. This ion produced characteristic fragment ions including the predominant base peak and tropyllium ion at m/z 197, a definitive breakdown product of Q6 (35Muraca R.F. Whittick J.S. Daves G.D. Friis P. Folkers K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 1505-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The concentration of Q6 in the mutant was estimated to be 3.32 μg/mg of mitochondrial protein (Fig. 3B). The value for the wild type parent was 3.33 μg/mg protein.FIGURE 5Presence of Q6 in mitochondrial lipid extracts of wild type and the coq10 null mutant.

A 50-μl sample of the extract was injected into a triple quadrapole mass spectrometer under flow injection conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both the mitochondrial lipids from the wild type strain W303-1A (upper panel) and the coq10 null (lower panel) contain abundant signals for Q6 and produce identical and characteristic identifying product ions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Suppressors of coq10 Mutants—BYΔCOQ10 and aW303ΔCOQ10 give rise to revertants when placed on a selective medium containing ethanol and glycerol as carbon sources. Diploid cells issued from back crosses of ρo derivatives of several revertants to the mutant had the revertant phenotype, indicating that the suppressor mutations were nuclear in origin. The nuclear DNA of a BYΔCOQ10 revertant was used to construct a genomic plasmid library in the high-copy plasmid YEp352 (22Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Transformation of aW303ΔCOQ10 with this library yielded a number of respiratory competent clones, which had plasmids containing COQ2, COQ7, or COQ8. Of the three genes the most effective in restoring respiration was COQ8, followed by COQ7, whereas the least effective was COQ2 (Fig. 6). The NADH oxidase activity measured in isolated mitochondria was also highest in the clone with the COQ8-(80% of wild type) and lowest in the clone with the COQ2-bearing plasmid (11% of wild type) (not shown). Transformants harboring the different suppressors either on a multicopy plasmid or integrated into nuclear DNA did not grow on the non-fermentable carbon sources as well as the revertant (Fig. 6). This suggested that the three COQ genes did not have the suppressor mutation conferring respiratory competence to the revertant. Growth of the mutant on non-fermentable substrates was substantially improved when COQ2, COQ7, and COQ8 were introduced on a high-copy episomal plasmid rather than integrated into chromosomal DNA in single copy, suggesting that the rescue is because of a hi"
https://openalex.org/W1976622956,"CTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a DNA-binding protein of vertebrates that plays essential roles in regulating genome activity through its capacity to act as an enhancer blocker. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify protein partners of CTCF that could regulate its activity. Using full-length CTCF as bait we recovered Kaiso, a POZ-zinc finger transcription factor, as a specific binding partner. The interaction occurs through a C-terminal region of CTCF and the POZ domain of Kaiso. CTCF and Kaiso are co-expressed in many tissues, and CTCF was specifically co-immunoprecipitated by several Kaiso monoclonal antibodies from nuclear lysates. Kaiso is a bimodal transcription factor that recognizes methylated CpG dinucleotides or a conserved unmethylated sequence (TNGCAGGA, the Kaiso binding site). We identified one consensus unmethylated Kaiso binding site in close proximity to the CTCF binding site in the human 5′ β-globin insulator. We found, in an insulation assay, that the presence of this Kaiso binding site reduced the enhancer-blocking activity of CTCF. These data suggest that the Kaiso-CTCF interaction negatively regulates CTCF insulator activity.

Insulators are DNA elements that maintain this partition, and they can be subdivided into two functional classes: barrier elements, which stop the spread of heterochromatin, and enhancer blockers, which prevent an enhancer from activating transcription in a neighboring repressed region (2West A.G. Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). One of the best studied loci regarding long-range transcriptional regulation is the β-globin locus of vertebrates (3Li Q. Peterson K.R. Fang X. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2002; 100: 3077-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). This locus contains an enhancer, the LCR (locus control region), which acts on the globin genes. The activity of the LCR is confined by two insulators, one at the 5′ boundary of the locus and another at the 3′ boundary. Both insulators depend on the same protein, CTCF 5The abbreviations used are: CTCFCTC-binding factorPOZpoxvirus and zinc fingerZFzinc fingerTBSTris-buffered salineGSTglutathione S-transferase.5The abbreviations used are: CTCFCTC-binding factorPOZpoxvirus and zinc fingerZFzinc fingerTBSTris-buffered salineGSTglutathione S-transferase.

CTC-binding factor poxvirus and zinc finger zinc finger Tris-buffered saline glutathione S-transferase. CTC-binding factor poxvirus and zinc finger zinc finger Tris-buffered saline glutathione S-transferase. CTCF was originally isolated as a zinc-finger transcription factor that recognized a CTC-rich sequence in the c-myc promoter (6Klenova E.M. Nicolas R.H. Paterson H.F. Carne A.F. Heath C.M. Goodwin G.H. Neiman P.E. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7612-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Over the years, CTCF has been shown to have complex and important roles in the control of gene expression (7Ohlsson R. Renkawitz R. Lobanenkov V. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 520-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). CTCF binds many different DNA target sequences through the combinatorial use of its 11 zinc fingers, and it is capable of both activating and repressing gene transcription. An additional role of CTCF is to act as an enhancer blocker that prevents communication between an enhancer and a target gene. This process is known as transcriptional insulation. CTCF and YY1 (8Kim J. Kollhoff A. Bergmann A. Stubbs L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) are the only two vertebrate proteins known to act as enhancer blockers. CTCF exerts this critical function at many loci (2West A.G. Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). For example, enhancer blocking by CTCF permits correct expression of the imprinted genes H19 and IGF2. At this locus, CTCF is only active on the maternal chromosome. The CTCF target sites on the paternal chromosome are methylated, and this modification completely precludes CTCF binding (9Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 10Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M.

Biol. 2000; 10: 853-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Recently, significant advances were made in our understanding of how CTCF functions as an enhancer blocker at the 5′ chicken β-globin insulator (12Yusufzai T.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8620-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Yusufzai T.M. Tagami H. Nakatani Y. Felsenfeld G. Mol Cell. 2004; 13: 291-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). At this insulator site, CTCF interacts with nucleophosmin, a nuclear matrix protein that is concentrated at the surface of the nucleolus. This is thought to result in the formation of physically separated DNA loops, which would then prevent an enhancer element in one chromatin loop from acting on a gene in the neighboring chromatin loop. Interestingly, this finding is consistent with results obtained in Drosophila, where a crucial link between nuclear architecture and transcriptional insulation was discovered (1Labrador M. Corces V.G. Cell. 2002; 111: 151-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It is likely that this model also accounts for CTCF action at other insulators, and yet alternative mechanisms cannot be ruled out at this point. The activity of enhancer blockers is not static but can turned on and off. Recent experiments with CTCF have shown that post-translational modification of the protein plays an important regulatory role (14Yu W. Ginjala V. Pant V. Chernukhin I. Whitehead J. Docquier F. Farrar D. Tavoosidana G. Mukhopadhyay R. Kanduri C. Oshimura M. Feinberg A.P. Lobanenkov V. Klenova E. Ohlsson R. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition, the function of CTCF can also be regulated through interacting proteins (15Lutz M. Burke L.J. LeFevre P. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Bonifer C. Filippova G.N. Lobanenkov V. Renkawitz R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to identify binding partners of CTCF that could influence its activity as an enhancer blocker. We report the identification of the protein Kaiso as a specific binding partner for CTCF. Kaiso is a member of the POZ (pox virus and zinc finger) family of zinc finger (ZF) transcription factors that are implicated in cancer and development (16Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3614-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To date, Kaiso is the only POZ-ZF protein that has been shown to have dual specificity DNA binding; it can bind methylated CpG dinucleotides (17Prokhortchouk A. Hendrich B. Jorgensen H. Ruzov A. Wilm M. Georgiev G. Bird A. Prokhortchouk E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1613-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) or a specific nonmethylated DNA sequence (TNGCAGGA) (18Daniel J.M. Spring C.M. Crawford H.C. Reynolds A.B. Baig A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2911-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Indeed, we identified one nonmethylated Kaiso consensus site near the CTCF binding site on the human 5′ β-globin insulator. We show that the presence of an intact Kaiso binding site near the CTCF binding site on the 5′ β-globin insulator inhibits the enhancer-blocking activity of CTCF. This raises the possibility that Kaiso is a negative regulator of CTCF enhancer-blocking activity. Plasmids—The two-hybrid bait plasmid was constructed by cloning the full-length chicken CTCF cDNA (provided by Rainer Renkawitz) between the EcoRI and BglII sites of vector pGBDU-C (1Labrador M. Corces V.G. Cell. 2002; 111: 151-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (URA3-marked, multicopy, ADH1 promoter driving expression of the bait fused to GAL4p1–147) (19James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Gal4-CTCF deletion constructs used in Fig. 3 have been described previously (20Defossez P.A. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 23: 5136-5141Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To construct the insulation reporters described in Fig. 4, we first cloned the relevant oligonucleotides into the EcoRV site of pBluescriptII KS. They were then PCR-amplified with primers containing MluI sites, digested with MluI, and inserted into the AscI site of pNI (21Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced.FIGURE 4A Kaiso binding site at the β-globin insulator regulates enhancer blocking by CTCF. A, structure of the human globin gene locus (not to scale).

Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strain was first transformed with the bait plasmid and then with a library of cDNAs from 6.5–9.5 days post-coitum mouse embryos cloned into the pASV3 vector (LEU2 marker, multicopy, PGK1 promoter driving the expression of peptides fused to the VP16 activation domain) (22Le Douarin B. Pierrat B. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The library was a kind gift from Régine Losson. Yeast transformation was done using lithium acetate (23Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Transformation efficiency was calculated by plating an aliquot of the cells on plates lacking uracil and leucine. Interactors were selected on plates lacking uracil, leucine, and histidine and containing 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. We then tested whether growth on plates lacking histidine was dependent on the bait plasmid. Finally, cells containing the candidate interactors were mated to PJ69–4α containing different bait plasmids to test the specificity of the interaction. Only two clones passed all of the screening procedures. Cell and Tissue Culture—Mammalian cells used in this study were the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa and the human erythroleukemia K562 cells. HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.5 μg/ml). K562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—HeLa cells were washed once with 5 ml PBS (pH 7.4) prior to the preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (24Klenova E. Chernukhin I. Inoue T. Shamsuddin S. Norton J. Methods. 2002; 26: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nuclear lysates were quantified by Bradford assay, and equal amounts of total protein were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Kaiso monoclonal antibodies 6F, 2G, 12H, 12G, and 11D (25Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. Hybridoma. 2001; 20: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or with rabbit anti-CTCF polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, catalog no. 06-917). The immune complexes were then subjected to SDS-PAGE as described previously (16Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3614-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was briefly blocked at room temperature with 3% skimmed milk powder in TBS (pH 7.4) before incubating at 4 °C overnight with rabbit anti-Kaiso polyclonal antibody at 1/12,000 dilution or rabbit anti-CTCF polyclonal antibody at 1/500 dilution in 3% milk/TBS. The primary antibodies were removed by rinsing the membranes five times with water and then once with TBS for 5 min each. The membranes were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, diluted 1:40,000 in 3% milk/TBS. Membranes were finally rinsed five times with water and once with TBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min each and processed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The in vitro interaction between GST-Kaiso and CTCF was tested as described previously (26Kelly K.F. Spring C.M. Otchere A.A. Daniel J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Insulation Assay—We used the method developed in the Felsenfeld laboratory (21Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The various reporters were linearized with SalI, and DNA was quantified by both UV spectrophotometry and analysis on an agarose gel. One hundred nanograms of each linearized plasmid was then electroporated into 1 × 107 K562 cells by electroporation. After 24 h of recovery, the cells were plated in 0.35% agar medium with 750 μg/ml Geneticin (active concentration) in two 150-mm dishes. Colonies were counted after 3 weeks. Each construct was tested in duplicate in at least three separate experiments, using a different DNA preparation each time. Statistical analysis of the results was done using Student's t test. Immunoprecipitation of Chromatin—HeLa cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 60 min at room temperature. The cells were lysed, and the chromatin was sonicated to an average size of 600 base pairs. For each experiment the chromatin prepared from 107 cells was immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of the relevant antibody, using a previously described protocol (27Rodova M. Kelly K.F. VanSaun M. Daniel J.M. Werle M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The primers used to amplify the human β-globin region are TGAGGATGCCTCCTTCTCTG and CAGCAGCTTCAGCTACCTCTC. Biochemical approaches have been used to seek CTCF interactors (28Chernukhin I.V. Shamsuddin S. Robinson A.F. Carne A.F. Paul A. El-Kady A.I. Lobanenkov V.V. Klenova E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29915-29921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To identify additional interactors and potential regulators of CTCF function, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a mouse embryo cDNA library and full-length CTCF as the bait. From 2 million transformants, we obtained only two positive clones, clones 1 and 88. The two clones contained overlapping fragments of the same cDNA, encoding a fraction of the transcription factor Kaiso (Fig. 1A). Both clones possessed 237 nucleotides upstream of the reported Kaiso ATG, which are translated in-frame with the rest of the cDNA, and generate a 79-amino acid extension not normally present in Kaiso. The clones differed by the fact that clone 1 encoded the first 217 amino acids of Kaiso, whereas clone 88 encoded the first 200 amino acids. This N-terminal region of Kaiso contains the POZ domain, which is known to mediate homo- and heterodimerization with other POZ family proteins or non-POZ domain proteins (29Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 30Collins T. Stone J.R. Williams A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3609-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This strongly suggested that the Kaiso POZ domain was involved in mediating the CTCF interaction. In fact, in an independent study, the Daniel laboratory identified CTCF as a Kaiso-specific binding partner using the Kaiso POZ domain as bait. 6J. M. Daniel, personal communication. As seen in Fig. 1B, we found that CTCF interacted with the full-length Kaiso protein and also with the isolated Kaiso POZ domain. When the POZ domain was deleted from Kaiso, interaction with CTCF was lost (Fig. 1B). This indicates that the POZ domain is both necessary and sufficient for the CTCF-Kaiso interaction. Because POZ domains are highly conserved and are present in a large number of transcription factors (30Collins T. Stone J.R. Williams A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3609-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we tested the specificity of the interaction by asking whether CTCF would interact with the POZ domain of four other POZ-ZF proteins (BCL-6, PLZF, HIC-1, FAZF). As seen in Fig. 1B and 1C, CTCF interacted specifically with the Kaiso POZ domain and with no other POZ domain tested. We conclude that CTCF recognizes a specific feature in the POZ domain of Kaiso. To determine whether CTCF and Kaiso interact in vivo in vertebrate cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells, which express both CTCF and Kaiso endogenously at high to moderate levels. We prepared nuclear extracts and immunoprecipitated Kaiso using five different Kaiso-specific monoclonal antibodies that have been characterized previously (25Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. Hybridoma. 2001; 20: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using CTCF-specific antibodies. As seen in Fig. 2, endogenous CTCF was specifically co-precipitated by the various Kaiso-specific monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, the preimmune serum failed to precipitate any CTCF-containing material. We thus conclude that CTCF and Kaiso exist in a complex in vertebrate cells. To further verify the interaction, we performed the reciprocal experiment by immunoprecipitating CTCF and Western blotting with a Kaiso-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody. However we failed to detect Kaiso co-precipitating with CTCF in this reciprocal situation. This may be due to the fact that the CTCF antiserum was raised against a region of CTCF that contains the Kaiso interaction domain (see “Discussion”). The CTCF antibody may recognize only uncomplexed CTCF, or the antibody may perturb the native CTCF-Kaiso interaction. An alternative explanation for the failure of the CTCF antiserum to co-immunoprecipitate Kaiso could be stoichiometry; CTCF protein may be in large excess relative to Kaiso, with only a minor subpopulation of CTCF molecules bound to Kaiso at steady state. To determine whether the interaction between CTCF and Kaiso is direct, we used an in vitro interaction assay. Radioactively labeled CTCF was produced by in vitro transcription and translation and was incubated with bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST) or with GST fused to full-length Kaiso (GST-Kaiso). No CTCF was retained after incubation with GST, whereas CTCF bound the GST-Kaiso protein (Fig. 2B). From this we conclude that Kaiso and CTCF interact directly, without the involvement of a bridging factor. To delineate the region of CTCF that interacts with Kaiso, we tested a series of CTCF deletion mutants for their ability to bind the Kaiso POZ domain in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3A). We delineated the binding domain of Kaiso to a C-terminal region encoding amino acids 641–728 of CTCF. This domain proved necessary and sufficient for the CTCF-Kaiso interaction. Because previous studies have demonstrated that specific highly conserved POZ domain residues of BCL-6 and PLZF are crucial for mediating the homo- and heterodimerization capabilities of these transcription factors (31Melnick A. Carlile G. Ahmad K.F. Kiang C.L. Corcoran C. Bardwell V. Prive G.G. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1804-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we questioned whether the equivalent residues in Kaiso were crucial for the Kaiso-CTCF interaction. Hence, to more precisely define the Kaiso binding site, we generated point mutations in the Kaiso POZ domain (D33N, K47Q, K47R, Y86A, and D33N/K47Q) and tested the capacity of these mutants to interact with CTCF in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3B). The lysine residue at position 47 (present in human Kaiso) could be substituted with arginine (present in murine Kaiso) with no apparent loss of activity. However, less conservative substitutions caused partial loss of interaction (lysine to glutamine) or totally abrogated the interaction (lysine to a proline). We also tested two other highly conserved amino acid residues that have been implicated as key determinants in POZ domain function (31Melnick A. Carlile G. Ahmad K.F. Kiang C.L. Corcoran C. Bardwell V. Prive G.G. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1804-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32Melnick A. Ahmad K.F. Arai S. Polinger A. Ball H. Borden K.L. Carlile G.W. Prive G.G. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6550-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We found that substituting the highly conserved aspartic acid 33 with an asparagine or tyrosine 86 with alanine also disrupted the Kaiso-CTCF interaction. Kaiso is a unique POZ-zinc finger protein with bimodal DNA-binding properties. It can recognize methyl-CpGs (17Prokhortchouk A. Hendrich B. Jorgensen H. Ruzov A. Wilm M. Georgiev G. Bird A. Prokhortchouk E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1613-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), or sequence-specific nonmethylated DNA (18Daniel J.M. Spring C.M. Crawford H.C. Reynolds A.B. Baig A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2911-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In site selection experiments, the preferred nonmethylated target of Kaiso is the sequence TNGCAGGA (18Daniel J.M. Spring C.M. Crawford H.C. Reynolds A.B. Baig A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2911-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In vitro, Kaiso binds this sequence with higher affinity than methylated DNA, but it is not known whether this preference also exists in vivo (18Daniel J.M. Spring C.M. Crawford H.C. Reynolds A.B. Baig A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2911-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). If Kaiso is a bona fide binding partner of CTCF, we postulated that Kaiso may cooperate with, or antagonize, CTCF regulation of target genes. Because CTCF binding to DNA is abrogated by DNA methylation (9Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 10Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar, 11Kanduri C. Pant V. Loukinov D. Pugacheva E. Qi C.F. Wolffe A. Ohlsson R. Lobanenkov V.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 853-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), we focused our search on the nonmethylated sequence-specific Kaiso binding sites. We examined known insulator regions for the presence of this consensus site and found one Kaiso binding site 34 nucleotides upstream of the CTCF binding site in the human 5′-HS5 β-globin insulator (Fig. 4A). Of note, this region does not contain any CpG dinucleotides and therefore cannot undergo DNA methylation. To test whether the presence of this Kaiso binding site affected insulation by CTCF, we performed an insulation assay using a characterized reporter construct, pNI (21Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains three relevant elements: an enhancer (mouse β-globin HS2); a reporter gene, NeoR, that renders cells resistant to neomycin; and a cloning site between the enhancer and the reporter where test sequences can be inserted. After linearization the plasmid is used to stably transform mammalian cells that are then subjected to neomycin selection. If the test sequence has no enhancer-blocking activity, NeoR is fully activated and many neomycin-resistant colonies grow during the selection. In contrast, if the test sequence harbors an enhancer blocker, NeoR is shielded from the enhancer, and few neomycin-resistant colonies appear. We tested four different sequences derived from the human 5′-HS5 insulator. All are 102 nucleotides in length. The first sequence simply reproduces a portion of the insulator containing both the CTCF and Kaiso binding sites. The sites are placed in the same orientation as in the endogenous locus: Kaiso is upstream on the enhancer side, and CTCF is on the target gene side. The second sequence differs in that it bears two point mutations in the Kaiso binding site. Previous studies have shown that these mutations totally abrogate Kaiso binding in vitro (18Daniel J.M. Spring C.M. Crawford H.C. Reynolds A.B. Baig A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2911-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The third sequence contains two mutations that have been shown to prevent CTCF binding to its target site (5Farrell C.M. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3820-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Finally, the fourth sequence contains the mutant form of both the CTCF and the Kaiso binding site. All four sequences were inserted into pNI and used for stable transformation, and the neomycin-resistant colonies were counted after selection (Fig. 4A). The experiments were performed in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 where the HS2 enhancer is functional and CTCF is present and active. We verified by Western blotting that K562 cells also express Kaiso (data not shown). The number of colonies obtained by transfection of unmodified pNI was the reference point of each experiment and was set at 100%. When cells were transfected with an equivalent amount of pNI containing a known CTCF-dependent insulator, chicken 5′-HS4, the number of neomycin-resistant colonies was greatly decreased, to approximately only 30% of that of pNI. This is in good agreement with published values (21Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) and establishes that our test conditions are within the expected optimal parameters. The construct containing mutations in both the CTCF and Kaiso binding sites yielded a high number of neomycin-resistant colonies, about 80% that of empty pNI. This suggests that there is minimal enhancer-blocking activity in this test sequence. The construct containing a wild-type Kaiso binding site next to an inactivated CTCF binding site also produced a high number of neomycin-resistant colonies (80%). This shows that the Kaiso binding site on its own does not have enhancer-blocking potential. The construct containing a wild-type CTCF binding site and a mutant Kaiso site decreased the number of colonies to about 35% that of pNI. This reflects the known enhancer-blocking activity of CTCF in this sequence. Again, the effect is of the same magnitude as the published data (5Farrell C.M. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3820-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Finally we tested the unmodified sequence, bearing functional CTCF and Kaiso binding sites. Strikingly this sequence had little or no enhancer-blocking potential and yielded the same proportion (∼75%) of neomycin-resistant colonies as the constructs lacking an intact CTCF binding site (∼80%). By comparing these results with those of the other constructs, we conclude that the presence of an intact Kaiso binding site greatly inhibits the enhancer-blocking activity of CTCF"
https://openalex.org/W2079227152,"Annexin A2 is a phospholipid-binding protein that forms a heterotetramer (annexin II-p11 heterotetramer; A2t) with p11 (S100A10). It has been reported that annexin A2 is involved in binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and in inducing membrane microdomain formation. To understand the mechanisms underlying these findings, we determined the membrane binding properties of annexin A2 wild type and mutants both as monomer and as A2t. Our results from surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that A2t and annexin A2 has modest selectivity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 over other phosphoinositides, which is conferred by conserved basic residues, including Lys279 and Lys281, on the convex surface of annexin A2. Fluorescence microscopy measurements using giant unilamellar vesicles showed that A2t of wild type, but not (K279A)2-(p11)2 or (K281A)2-(p11)2, specifically induced the formation of 1-microm-sized PtdIns(4,5)P2 clusters, which were stabilized by cholesterol. Collectively, these studies elucidate the structural determinant of the PtdIns(4,5)P2 selectivity of A2t and suggest that A2t may be involved in the regulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 clustering in the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2107960085,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with clinical manifestations appearing in old age, however, the initial stages of this disease may begin early in life. AD is characterized by the presence of excessive deposits of aggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, which are derived from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) following processing by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Recently, we have reported that developmental exposure of rats to Pb resulted in latent elevation of APP mRNA, APP, and Abeta in old age. Here we examined whether latent up-regulation in APP expression and Abeta levels is exacerbated by concurrent disturbances in APP processing or Abeta aggregation. Among the environmental metals tested, only Abeta solutions containing Pb promoted the formation of Abeta aggregates at nanomolar concentrations. The lifetime profiles of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases remained constant in adult and aging animals, and developmental exposure to Pb did not alter them. Furthermore, the addition of various concentrations of Pb (0.1 to 50 microM) to cerebral cortical extracts derived from control animals also did not affect the proteolytic activities of these enzymes. Therefore, we propose that amyloidogenesis is promoted by a latent response to developmental reprogramming of the expression of the APP gene by early exposure to Pb, as well as enhancement of Abeta aggregation in old age. In rodents, these events occur without Pb-induced disturbances to the enzymatic processing of APP. The aforementioned results provide further evidence for the developmental basis of amyloidogenesis and late-life disturbances in AD-associated proteins by environmental agents."

Protein kinase A phosphorylates 5-lipoxygenase on Ser523, and this reduces its activity. We report here that phosphorylation of Ser523 also shifts the subcellular distribution of 5-lipoxygenase from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation and redistribution of 5-lipoxygenase could be produced by overexpression of the protein kinase A catalytic subunit α, by pharmacological activators of protein kinase A, and by prostaglandin E2. Mimicking phosphorylation by replacing Ser523 with glutamic acid caused cytoplasmic localization; replacement of Ser523 with alanine prevented phosphorylation and redistribution in response to protein kinase A activation. Because Ser523 is positioned within the nuclear localization sequence-518 of 5-lipoxygenase, the ability of protein kinase A to phosphorylate and alter the localization of green fluorescent protein fused to the nuclear localization sequence-518 peptide was also tested. Site-directed replacement of Ser523 with glutamic acid within the peptide impaired nuclear accumulation; overexpression of the protein kinase A catalytic subunit α and pharmacological activation of protein kinase caused phosphorylation of the fusion protein at Ser523, and the phosphorylated protein was found chiefly in the cytoplasm. Taken together, these results indicate that phosphorylation of Ser523 inhibits the nuclear import function of a nuclear localization sequence, resulting in the accumulation of 5-lipoxygenase enzyme in the cytoplasm. As cytoplasmic localization can be associated with reduced leukotriene synthetic capacity, phosphorylation of Ser523 serves to inhibit leukotriene production by both impairing catalytic activity and by placing the enzyme in a site that is unfavorable for action.

Sperling R. Rubin P. Israel E. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1994; 22: 251-262PubMed Google Scholar), atherosclerosis (3Dwyer J.H. Allayee H. Dwyer K.M. Fan J. Wu H. Mar R.

Therefore, the regulation of 5-LO action has been a focus of interest. leukotriene 5-lipoxygenase protein kinase A nuclear localization sequence wild type green fluorescent protein phosphoSer523 5-LO protein kinase A catalytic subunit α N6-benzoyladenosine 8-bromo 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphate-buffered saline prostaglandin. Previous studies have shown that the subcellular localization of soluble 5-LO before cell stimulation can affect the amount of LT secreted following cell stimulation. For example, import of 5-LO into the nucleus in neutrophils upon adherence increases LTB4 secretion upon subsequent stimulation (9Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). On the other hand, nuclear import of 5-LO following adherence rapidly inhibits LTC4 synthetic capacity in eosinophils (10Brock T.G. Anderson J.A. Fries F.P. Peters-Golden M. Sporn P.H.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1669-1676PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas adherence can change 5-LO localization and LT production rapidly, cytokines alter these parameters more slowly. For example, interleukin-3 has been shown to increase the nuclear localization of 5-LO and increase LTC4 synthetic capacity, in eosinophils treated for 6 h (11Cowburn A.S. Holgate S.T. Sampson A.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 456-465PubMed Google Scholar). Also, differentiation of human cord blood-derived mast cells with interleukin-3 or interleukin-5 for 5 days increased both nuclear localization of 5-LO and LTC4 production upon cell stimulation (12Hsieh F.H. Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Austen K.F. Boyce J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that different factors can alter 5-LO localization and that 5-LO redistribution affects LT generation upon subsequent cell activation. However, little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways that alter 5-LO localization and consequent LT production. We recently demonstrated that 5-LO can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) on Ser523 (13Luo M. Jones S.M. Coffey M.J. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41512-41520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have demonstrated that factors that elevate cellular cAMP levels rapidly inhibit LT synthesis (e.g. Refs. 14Kooman W.J. Orange R.P. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1970; 105: 1096-1102PubMed Google Scholar and 15Flamand N. Surette M.E. Picard S. Bourgoin S. Borgeat P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We found that phosphorylation of 5-LO, in cells or in vitro, as well as mimicking phosphorylation by substituting Ser523 with Glu, reduced the enzymatic activity of 5-LO. Thus, the direct phosphorylation of 5-LO by PKA may contribute to the reduction in LT synthesis that occurs following elevation of cellular cAMP. Interestingly, Ser523 is embedded in one of the three nuclear localization sequences (NLS) of 5-LO, NLS518 (16Jones S.M. Luo M. Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38550-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because the function of a classical NLS is to bind with a karyopherin (importin) protein (17Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) to initiate import, we asked whether phosphorylation at Ser523 would inhibit the nuclear import of 5-LO. We report here, for the first time to our knowledge, that phosphorylation of 5-LO on Ser523 results in an accumulation of 5-LO in the cytoplasm. Plasmids, Mutagenesis, and DNA Construction—Plasmids containing the wild type (WT) 5-LO or the S523A mutant of 5-LO, alone in pcDNA or fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in pEGFP, have been described previously (13Luo M.

Plasmid containing the NLS518 peptide of 5-LO (encoding Val514-Leu535) in fusion with GFP in pEGFP has also been described previously (16Jones S.M. Luo M. Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38550-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); substitution of Ser523 with Glu in 5-LO or the NLS518 peptide was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's directions. The double mutant, mutNLS112+S271A, was produced by site-directed mutagenesis of Ser271 in the previously described and characterized mutNLS112 of GFP/5-LO (19Jones S.M. Luo M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10257-10263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), where mutNLS112 is R115Q/K117Q/R120Q. Mutations and protein frame reading were verified by DNA sequence analysis (DNA Sequencing Core, University of Michigan). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). Plasmid and oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. The plasmid encoding the mouse PKA catalytic subunit α (Cα) was a gift of Dr. Michael D. Uhler (Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunoblotting—NIH 3T3 cells obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were grown under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% calf serum and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (complete medium). Cells were plated at 70% confluency and transfected with plasmids using Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. 16-20 h posttransfection, cells were treated with complete medium containing various compounds including 100 μm forskolin (Calbiochem) with and without 200 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Calbiochem), 1 mm each of N6-benzoyladenosine-(6-bnz-) cAMP, 8-n-hexylaminoadenosine-cAMP, 8-bromo (8-br-)-cAMP, dibutyryl-cAMP (all from Biolog Life Science Institute, Germany), with and without 1-30 μm H89 or 1-30 μm SB203580 (Calbiochem) for 3 h or various time points from 0 to 8 h. Following treatment, cells were washed with PBS, harvested by a rubber policeman, and lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid (Sigma) with complete protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). In some cases, cell pellets were directly lysed in 1× SDS loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) and heated twice in boiling water for 3 min. Protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were probed with the previously described rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against phosphorylated 5-LO Ser523 (titer: 1:3000) and antibodies against purified human leukocyte 5-LO (a generous gift of Dr. J. Evans, Merck Research Laboratories; titer 1:3000) or GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; titer 1:500) followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was performed using NIH Image software. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—NIH 3T3 cells grown on two-well chamber slides (BD Falcon™) were transfected with 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA overnight, then washed, and treated as described. For immunostaining, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 25 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubated with rabbit phospho-5-LO antibody (p5-LO, titer 1: 200) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed in permeabilization buffer and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (titer 1:250) in blocking buffer for 1 h. Mounting was done in mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cells were visualized and imaged using a Nikon E600 microscope equipped for epifluorescence and digital image capture using a SPOT RT camera. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser confocal microscope. Quantitation of Subcellular Distribution following PKA Activation— As described previously (16Jones S.M. Luo M. Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38550-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), 3T3 cells at 16 h posttransfection were treated with 1 mm 8-br-cAMP for various time points from 0 to 6 h. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, 100 positive cells were scored as to whether nuclear fluorescence was greater than, equal to, or less than cytosolic fluorescence. Care was taken to avoid damaged, dead, or autofluorescent cells. Results from at least three independent transfections were used for statistical analysis. As a second approach, 100 individual cells from each time point after 8-br-cAMP treatment were scored for cytosolic and nuclear fluorescence intensity. Using Adobe Photoshop 6.0, grayscale digital images were adjusted to include the full black-to-white range, and representative gray values, from 0 (white) to 100 (black), were obtained for the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. Cytoplasmic and nuclear values for each cell were summed to give total cellular fluorescence, and the percent fluorescence values for the nuclear compartment were calculated. Measurement of Intracellular cAMP Production—After (20Aronoff D.M. Canetti C. Peters-Golden M. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), 3T3 cells were plated until confluent in 6-well tissue culture dishes in complete medium. The medium was then replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were exposed to prostaglandin (PG) E2, the EP2-selective agonist butaprost, the EP4-selective agonist ONO-AE1-329 (final concentration of each 1 μm), or vehicle for the times indicated. Culture supernatants were aspirated, and the cells were lysed by incubation for 20 min with 0.1 m HCl (22 °C), followed by disruption using a cell scraper. Intracellular cAMP levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). PGE2 and butaprost (supplied as the free acid) were from Cayman Chemical; ONO-AE1-329 was a generous gift from ONO Pharmaceutical. Compounds were dissolved in Me2SO4, and stock solutions were stored at -80 °C until used in assays. Required dilutions of all compounds were prepared immediately before use, and equivalent quantities of vehicle were added to the appropriate controls. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance, using p < 0.05 as indicative of statistical significance. Pairs of group means were analyzed using the Tukey-Kramer posttest. Persistent Phosphorylation on Ser523 of 5-LO—As phosphorylation of proteins can be transient, the effects of phosphorylation may also be transitory. To clearly evaluate the effects of phosphorylation of Ser523 on the localization of 5-LO, we co-transfected NIH 3T3 cells with plasmids encoding GFP/5-LO with or without Cα. In cells expressing only GFP/5-LO, the majority of the fluorescence was in the nucleus, co-localizing with DAPI-stained DNA (Fig. 1, A-C). As expected, these cells were negative for p5-LO. In cells expressing GFP/5-LO with Cα, the fluorescence was outside of the nucleus, in the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 1D). Staining for p5-LO matched the fluorescence pattern of GFP/5-LO almost exactly (Fig. 1E). These results demonstrated that the overexpression of the active catalytic subunit of PKA with GFP/5-LO resulted in the accumulation of 5-LO in the cytoplasm, rather than in the nucleus. The phosphorylation of specific residues on proteins can be mimicked by substitution of the residue with an acidic amino acid, such as glutamic acid. The replacement of Ser523 with Glu on GFP/5-LO resulted in a striking redistribution from the nucleus (WT, Fig. 2, A and B) to the cytoplasm (S523E, Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, a single amino acid change, like co-transfection with Cα, produced cytoplasmic localization of GFP/5-LO. Activation of PKA Leads to Phosphorylation and Redistribution of 5-LO—To study the effects of PKA activation on 5-LO localization, we first tested different agonists for their ability to phosphorylate 5-LO. The adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, with or without the phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, as well as PKA-specific agonist 6-bnz-cAMP and the cAMP analogues 8-br-cAMP and dibutyryl-cAMP, were all able to elicit phosphorylation of 5-LO on Ser523, as indicated by positive immunostaining using the p5-LO antibody (Fig. 3A). However, the B site activator of PKA, 8-n-hexylaminoadenosine-cAMP, appeared to be a poor agonist. The treatment of cells overexpressing 5-LO with Ser523 replaced with Ala did not show phosphorylation in response to the PKA-specific agonist 6-bnz-cAMP (Fig. 3B). Based on these results, additional experiments focused on the effects of 6-bnz-cAMP and 8-br-cAMP on 5-LO phosphorylation and localization. The kinetics of phosphorylation of 5-LO by PKA was evaluated using 6-bnz-cAMP, a potent, selective activator of PKA (21Christensen A.E. Selheim F. de Rooij J. Dremier S. Schwede F. Dao K.K. Martinez A. Maenhaut C. Bos J.L. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35394-35402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Although significant phosphorylation of 5-LO was evident within 1 h after the addition of 6-bnz-cAMP, phosphorylation continued to increase over 6 h (Fig. 4). Modest phosphorylation of Ser523, as indicated by positive staining with the p5-LO antibody, was evident in untreated cultures. Enhanced phosphorylation could be seen as early as 15 min after treatment (data not shown). Also, treatment with the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid or calyculin A significantly increased phosphorylation at earlier time points (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that PKA activation results in a relatively slow but continuous phosphorylation of 5-LO, countered in part by dephosphorylation by endogenous phosphatase activity, with phosphorylated 5-LO accumulating over time. Because persistent phosphorylation altered 5-LO localization, it was of interest to determine whether a time-dependent redistribution of 5-LO paralleled the time-dependent phosphorylation. Live cell imaging of individual cells indicated that treatment with either 6-bnz-cAMP or 8-br-cAMP resulted in a significant change in the subcellular localization of 5-LO within 1 h in some cells, whereas other cells did not respond at all (data not shown). To quantitate the change in localization within a population of cells, cultures were treated with 1 mm 8-br-cAMP for various times, then fixed, photographed, and scored for subcellular distribution of GFP/5-LO. In untreated cells overexpressing GFP/5-LO, essentially all cells had fluorescent nuclei (Fig. 5A). Following PKA activation, the difference in the fluorescence between the nucleus and cytoplasm diminished, with some cells having nuclei that were darker than the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, B and C). Quantitative analysis of nuclear fluorescence of untreated cells indicated that most cells exhibited moderate (Fig. 5D, N1) or strong (Fig. 5D, N2) nuclear accumulation of WT 5-LO. PKA activation resulted in a decrease in the percentage of cells with strong nuclear fluorescence and an increase in cells with predominantly cytoplasmic fluorescence. Cells overexpressing GFP/5-LO with the S523A mutation showed moderate to strong nuclear fluorescence that was not affected by PKA activation (data not shown). A statistically significant decrease in the percentage of cells with predominantly nuclear fluorescence, paralleled by a significant increase in cytoplasmic predominant cells, was documented at 6 h after 8-br-cAMP treatment (Fig. 6A). Immunofluorescent staining of these cells with the p5-LO antibody revealed strong positive staining within the cytoplasm (Fig. 6B). Thus, PKA activation produced a time-dependent redistribution of 5-LO with accumulation of phosphorylated 5-LO in the cytoplasm.FIGURE 6Quantitative and visual characterization of GFP/5-LO subcellular localization after treatment with 8-br-cAMP for 6 h.

B, fluorescent visualization of total GFP/5-LO (GFP), phosphorylated GFP/5-LO (p5-LO), or DNA (DAPI). Results are from one experiment and are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From these results, it was not clear whether PKA phosphorylation of 5-LO occurred in the cytoplasm, in the nucleus, or both. Further examination of cells treated with 8-br-cAMP for 6 h and stained for p5-LO revealed that several cells with more nuclear than cytoplasmic GFP/5-LO also stained positive for p5-LO. Confocal analysis of these cells indicated that the majority of the p5-LO was in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7, top and bottom), although some was evident within the nucleus, particularly at the periphery (Fig. 7, middle). To further test whether cytoplasmic 5-LO is phosphorylated more than nuclear 5-LO, we compared the ability of PKA to target WT GFP/5-LO versus a mutant developed to alter 5-LO localization but not activity. This mutant, with substitutions to inactivate NLS112 and block phosphorylation of Ser271, has significantly stronger cytoplasmic localization than the WT protein (Fig. 8A). Activation of PKA with 8-br-cAMP produced greater phosphorylation of the mutant than WT GFP/5-LO, as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 8B). These results indicate that although PKA may be able to phosphorylate 5-LO within the nucleus there appears to be greater targeting of 5-LO within the cytoplasm.FIGURE 8Greater phosphorylation of a mutant of 5-LO with more cytoplasmic protein.

Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We asked whether phosphorylation of Ser523 was independent of p38 MAPK activity in vivo by treating cells with the selective p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. The PKA/PKG inhibitor H-89 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of 5-LO by 8-br-cAMP, whereas SB203580 was without effect up to 30 μm (Fig. 9A). It has been reported that the IC50 of SB203580 on p38 MAPK is 0.5 μm (23Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3956) Google Scholar). In addition, 3T3 cells overexpressing GFP/5-LO retained nuclear localization of 5-LO and did not stain with the p5-LO antibody when treated with 8-br-cAMP (1 mm) plus H-89 (30 μm) (Fig. 9B). The inhibition of p38 MAPK with SB203580 (30 μm) did not block cytoplasmic localization and phosphorylation of Ser523 on 5-LO in response to 8-br-cAMP (Fig. 9B). PKA Can Phosphorylate and Alter the Localization of the NLS518 Peptide—We previously reported that the NLS518 peptide was sufficient to drive nuclear accumulation of GFP (16Jones S.M. Luo M. Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38550-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We asked whether phosphorylation of GFP-tagged NLS518 on Ser523 would alter nuclear import. As expected, GFP alone was distributed diffusely throughout the cell (Fig. 10A), whereas GFP/NLS518 was strongly accumulated within the nucleus (Fig. 10C). Substitution of Ser523 with Glu, to produce a phosphorylation mimic within the GFP/NLS518 construct, resulted in a relatively diffuse distribution, consistent with little or no active nuclear import (Fig. 10E). Co-transfection of 3T3 cells with GFP/NLS518 and Cα resulted in more cytoplasmic than nuclear GFP fluorescence, with strong positive staining with the p5-LO antibody, particularly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 11, A-C). Finally, activation of PKA with 8-br-cAMP also resulted in strong positive staining with p5-LO, again in the cytoplasm (Fig. 11, D-F). In this treatment, the effect of phosphorylation on localization becomes most apparent, as abundant fluorescent protein is able to be accumulated in the nucleus when NLS518 is not phosphorylated and the majority of phosphorylated NLS518 is found in the cytoplasm. Taken together, these results suggest that the NLS518 peptide itself can be targeted by PKA and that when phosphorylated its ability to drive nuclear import is impaired.FIGURE 11Phosphorylation of the NLS518 peptide by the catalytic subunit of PKA and by PKA activation. A-C, 3T3 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding both GFP/NLS518 and Cα and, after 16 h, were fixed and stained for p5-LO. D-F, cells overexpressing GFP/NLS518 were stimulated with 8-br-cAMP for 6 h then were fixed and stained for p5-LO. Images show GFP/NLS518 (GFP), p5-LO and DNA (DAPI).

Soderman D.D. Zanetti M.E. Dougherty H.W. McCauley E. Kuehl Jr., F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4349-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). PGE2 acts through four distinct G protein-coupled receptor subtypes (EP1-4), with distinct signaling pathways. Because the Gs-coupled EP2 and EP4 receptors activate adenylate cyclase activity (25Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 579-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we measured changes in intracellular cAMP in response to PGE2 (Fig. 12A). Treatment of 3T3 cells with PGE2 (1 μm) provoked an immediate elevation of cAMP, resulting in a 50% increase in cAMP 5 min after PGE2 exposure. Levels remained elevated for ∼60 min. To determine the contribution of either EP2 or EP4 receptors to this increase, cells were treated with equimolar amounts of the EP2-selective agonist butaprost or the EP4-selective agonist ONO-AE1-329 for various times. Both butaprost and ONO-AE1-329 evoked an ∼20% increase in intracellular cAMP within 15 min that returned to baseline levels by 60 min (data not shown). Treatment with the same concentration of PGE2 also resulted in phosphorylation of 5-LO within 15 min, as indicated by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 12B). Phosphorylation of 5-LO in response to PGE2 continued to increase over 6 h, although the level of phosphorylation obtained with PGE2 was less than that induced by 6-bnz-cAMP. The vehicle, Me2SO, did not induce phosphorylation. After 6 h of treatment with PGE2, 5-LO was clearly cytosolic in some cells, as indicated by redistribution of GFP/5-LO (Fig. 12C). Some cells showed little redistribution following PGE2 treatment, with 5-LO remaining largely within the nucleus; other cells had a balanced distribution between nucleus and cytoplasm. Following fixation and staining for p5-LO, cells with cytoplasmic 5-LO based on GFP fluorescence (Fig. 12D) also had positive staining for p5-LO in the cytoplasm (Fig. 12E). Cells that had predominantly nuclear 5-LO following PGE2 treatment did not typically stain positive for p5-LO (not shown). As 5-LO serves the key function of initiating LT synthesis from arachidonic acid, it represents a primary point for regulating the generation of these potent proinflammatory mediators. Several studies have demonstrated that changes in the subcellular localization of 5-LO in resting leukocytes significantly affects the amount of LT produced when those leukocytes are activated. For example, we have recently used molecular modification of the import sequences of 5-LO to show that LTB4 production decreased, as less 5-LO could be imported into the nucleus (26Luo M. Jones S.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12165-12170Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In that study and others, the positioning of 5-LO in the cytoplasm of resting leukocytes typically correlated with reduced production of LTs upon cell stimulation. In this study, we have examined the effects of phosphorylation of Ser523 on the localization of 5-LO. This residue is nested in NLS518, identified as 518RGRKSSGFPKSVK530 (16Jones S.M. Luo M. Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38550-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previous work demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser523 significantly reduced the intrinsic enzymatic activity of 5-LO (13Luo M. Jones S.M. Coffey M.J. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41512-41520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We report here, for the first time to our knowledge, that phosphorylation of Ser523 also blocks nuclear import, resulting in the accumulation of 5-LO in the cytoplasm. Thus, phosphorylation of 5-LO achieves two effects that both serve to reduce cellular LT generation: a direct molecular effect on the intrinsic catalytic activity of 5-LO and a slower, cellular effect of placing 5-LO in a subcellular compartment that is less favorable for arachidonic acid metabolism. A very surprising result is the apparently slow rate of phosphorylation of 5-LO following PKA activation. One contributing factor is the activity of endogenous phosphatases. Elevated cAMP levels increase activity of phosphatases (27Revan S. Montesinos M.C. Naime D. Landau S. Cronstein B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17114-17118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Feschenko M.S. Stevenson E. Nairn A.C. Sweadner K.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that our results might underestimate the true rate of phosphorylation. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that pretreatment with the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid or calyculin A resulted in stronger phosphorylation of 5-LO at earlier time points (data not shown). Thus, phosphorylation of 5-LO by PKA may occur in minutes, as observed in response to PGE2 treatment. Dephosphorylation by phosphatases, then, would serve to limit the time of phosphorylation and its impact on LT synthesis. The positioning of Ser523 within NLS518 suggests that this NLS is functional in promoting import when Ser523 is not phosphorylated, with phosphorylation inhibiting import perhaps by interfering with docking of karyopherins with the NLS. Activation of PKA, as following PGE2 treatment, typically resulted in strong cytoplasmic localization of 5-LO in some cells, with normal import in others. These results are strongly reminiscent of those obtained with mutation of NLS518, which left two functional but regulated NLSs intact (16Jones S.M. Luo M. Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38550-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Jones S.M. Luo M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10257-10263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This suggests that 5-LO that is phosphorylated in the cytoplasm may conceivably be imported through the action of other NLSs. That is, the presence of three NLSs allows several grades of import of 5-LO (29Luo M. Pang C.W.M. Gerken A.E. Brock T.G. Traffic. 2004; 5: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Silencing of NLS518 leaves two functional sequences, NLS112 and NLS158, which can mediate import of 5-LO. As nuclear export appears also to be regulated (30Hanaka H. Shimizu T. Izumi T. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Covin R.B. Brock T.G. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L303-L310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), other factors besides phosphorylation of NLS518 must be able to influence the final positioning of 5-LO. Activated PKA can phosphorylate nuclear targets, like the cAMP response element binding protein, and so it may phosphorylate 5-LO within the nucleus. This raises the possibility that, in addition to reducing 5-LO activity, phosphorylation may promote the export of 5-LO. We cannot rule out this possibility. However, our results using the GFP/NLS518 fusion peptide, which showed that unphosphorylated protein was found in the nucleus and that phosphorylated protein remained cytoplasmic (Fig. 11), strongly indicated that phosphorylation inhibits the import function of this NLS. PGE2 generally down-regulates the function of leukocytes, and this is mediated by elevation of cAMP through activation of the EP2 and EP4 receptors. For example, PGE2 inhibits macrophage phagocytosis (20Aronoff D.M. Canetti C. Peters-Golden M. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and neutrophil phospholipase D (32Burelout C. Thibault N. Levasseur S. Simard S. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) through EP2, monocyte IL-12 production through EP4 (33Iwasaki K. Noguchi K. Endo H. Kondo H. Ishikawa I. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 18: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and major histocompatibility complex class II expression in dendritic cells (34Harizi H. Grosset C. Gualde N. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2003; 73: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and the release of tumor necrosis factor-α, endothelin-1, and interleukin-1α by macrophages via both EP2 and EP4 (35Treffkorn L. Scheibe R. Maruyama T. Dieter P. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2004; 74: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Through these suppressive effects on leukocytes, PGE2 can contribute to the resolution of inflammation. PGE2 has been shown to inhibit LT synthesis through the elevation of cAMP (24Ham E.A. Soderman D.D. Zanetti M.E. Dougherty H.W. McCauley E. Kuehl Jr., F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4349-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 36Wightman P.D. Dallob A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9176-9180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that PGE2 promotes phosphorylation of 5-LO on Ser523 and causes redistribution of 5-LO to the cytoplasm, both effects that can reduce the synthesis of proinflammatory LTs, provides insight into the mechanism by which this effect is mediated. Previously, we reported that PKA modulators did not alter the subcellular distribution of 5-LO in the first 30 min after treatment (13Luo M. Jones S.M. Coffey M.J. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41512-41520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the changes in 5-LO localization are slow, with only modest changes observable at 2-h posttreatment. We also found that the effects of PKA modulators were heterogeneous, with phosphorylation as well as redistribution of 5-LO occurring faster in some cells, slower in others, and not at all in some cells (data not shown). This may be because of the fact that a non-synchronized cell culture is heterogeneous. The lag between phosphorylation and redistribution of 5-LO suggests that phosphorylation may be the initial factor affecting 5-LO activity, with redistribution serving to increase or prolong the effects of phosphorylation. It is important to note that elevation of intracellular cAMP also inhibits the release of arachidonic acid (37Flamand N. Boudreault S. Picard S. Austin M. Surette M.E. Plante H. Krump E. Vallee M.J. Gilbert C. Naccache P. Laviolette M. Borgeat P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 38Godfrey R. Manzi R. Gennaro D. Hoffstein S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Fonteh A.N. Winkler J.D. Torphy T.J. Heravi J. Undem B.J. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 339-350PubMed Google Scholar). This effect is rapid, whereas the effects of PKA activation on 5-LO phosphorylation and subcellular distribution appear to be slower. Whether arachidonic acid release remains impaired after prolonged exposure to cAMP-elevating agents is, to our knowledge, not known. It is possible that at early time points inhibition of LT synthesis by elevated cAMP results primarily from decreased arachidonic acid release. At later time points, 5-LO redistribution to the cytosolic compartment and its sustained phosphorylation on Ser523 will likely lead to a dramatic decrease in the capacity to synthesize LTs even by trans-cellular metabolism (i.e. where arachidonic acid originates from other cell types unaffected by the cAMP-elevating agent). Additional kinetic experiments with leukocytes are necessary to assess this possible sequential cascade of molecular events involved in the down-regulation of LT synthesis by elevated cAMP concentrations. The experiments presented in this study take advantage of the ease-of-transfection of 3T3 cells to address molecular aspects of the regulation of 5-LO. However, an important question is the relevance of these findings to primary leukocytes. Cell transformation can be achieved by reduced phosphatase activity, (40Schuchner S. Wintersberger E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9266-9273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is likely that the transformed 3T3 cells used here have reduced phosphatase activity when compared with primary, differentiated leukocytes. Consistent with this possibility, we found that inhibition of endogenous phosphatases is required to demonstrate phosphorylation of Ser523 on 5-LO in leukocytes (data not shown). Additional studies on the regulation of the phosphorylation of Ser523 on 5-LO in leukocytes, in vitro and in vivo, are in progress. In summary, we report here that elevation of cAMP results in redistribution of 5-LO from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through phosphorylation of Ser523 and inhibition of nuclear import through NLS518. As both phosphorylation on Ser523 and positioning 5-LO in the cytoplasm serve to reduce LT synthesis, these events may be important in the resolution of inflammation."

Apigenin (4', 5, 7,-trihydroxyflavone), a common dietary flavonoid abundantly present in fruits and vegetables, has shown remarkable anti-proliferative effects against various malignant cell lines. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be elucidated. We investigated the in vivo growth inhibitory effects of apigenin on androgen-sensitive human prostate carcinoma 22Rv1 tumor xenograft subcutaneously implanted in athymic male nude mice. Apigenin was administered to mice by gavage at doses of 20 and 50 mug/mouse/day in 0.2 ml of a vehicle containing 0.5% methyl cellulose and 0.025% Tween 20 in two different protocols. In the first protocol, apigenin was administered for 2 wk before inoculation of tumor and was continued for 8 wk, resulting in significant inhibition of tumor volume by 44 and 59% (P<0.002 and 0.0001), and wet weight of tumor by 41 and 53% (P<0.05), respectively. In the second protocol, administration of apigenin began 2 wk after tumor inoculation and continued for 8 wk; tumor volume and wet weights of tumor were reduced by 39 and 53% (P<0.01 and 0.002) and 31 and 42% (P<0.05), respectively. The tumor inhibitory effect of apigenin was more pronounced in the first protocol of extended treatment, which was associated with increased accumulation of human IGFBP-3 in mouse serum along with significant increase in IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein expression in tumor xenograft. Apigenin intake by these mice also resulted in simultaneous decrease in serum IGF-I levels and induction of apoptosis in tumor xenograft. Importantly, tumor growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis, and accumulation of IGFBP-3 correlated with increasing serum and tumor apigenin levels. In both studies, animals did not exhibit any signs of toxicity or reduced food consumption. In cell culture studies, apigenin treatment resulted in cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis, which correlated with increased accumulation of IGFBP-3 in culture medium and cell lysate. These effects were associated with significant reduction in IGF-I secretion; inhibition of IGF-I-induced cell cycle progression and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation, along with an increase in sub-G1 peak by apigenin. Further, treatment of cells with IGFBP-3 antisense oligonucleotide reversed these effects and attenuated apigenin-mediated inhibition of IRS-1 phosphorylation conferring inhibitory effects of apigenin on IGF-signaling. This study presents the first evidence that the in vitro and in vivo growth inhibitory effects of apigenin involve modulation of IGF-axis signaling in prostate cancer."

DR4 and DR5 share a common intracellular domain, called the death domain (DD), which is indispensable for initiation of the intracellular signaling cascade leading to cell death.

TRA-8 competes with TRAIL for binding to DR5 and almost entirely mimics the apoptosis-inducing mechanism of TRAIL. The authors believed that DR5 was not sufficient to trigger apoptosis in normal hepatocytes (23Ichikawa K. Liu W. Zhao L. Wang Z. Liu D. Ohtsuka T. Zhang H. Mountz J.D. Koopman W.J. Kimberly R.P. Zhou T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). However, a recent study showed that at least some anti-DR5 and anti-DR4 mAbs did induce human hepatocytes apoptosis (24Mori E. Thomas M. Motoki K. Nakazawa K. Tahara T. Tomizuka K. Ishida I. Kataoka S. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot draw a definite conclusion on the hepatocyte toxicity of soluble TRAIL or mAbs against TRAIL receptors now. Studies on the mechanism of anti-DR5 mAbs will help us to understand the complicated signal pathways mediated by DR5.In this article, we report studies on AD5–10, a novel monoclonal antibody against human DR5. AD5–10 induces apoptosis in various tumor cell lines in the absence of second cross-linking in vitro and exhibits a strong tumoricidal activity in vivo. AD5–10 does not induce cell death of human normal hepatocytes and primary peripheral blood lymphocytes, and the injection with high doses of AD5–10 in mice causes no toxic reaction in liver, spleen, and kidney. Unlike TRA-8, AD5–10 does not compete with TRAIL for binding to DR5, and there is a synergistic effect between TRAIL and AD5–10 on their tumoricidal activity. Downstream cell signals induced by AD5–10 and TRAIL were also compared. Both TRAIL and AD5–10 activate caspase cascade and induce a classical apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Interestingly, AD5–10 kills Jurkat cells in the presence of Z-VAD, whereas TRAIL does not, indicating a caspase-independent cell death promoted by AD5–10. Furthermore, we show that RIP is essential for this caspase-independent cell death. Z-VAD inhibits the activation of JNK/p38 by TRAIL but not AD5–10. Both TRAIL and AD5–10 are capable of activating of NF-κB, but there are differences between the regulation of NF-κB activity by TRAIL and that by AD5–10 in certain cell lines. These findings show that DR5 can mediate distinct cell signals when interacting with different extracellular proteins. The differences in the cell signals induced by AD5–10 and TRAIL are undoubtedly significant for further studies. Illustration of the mechanisms may lead to the development of new strategies for cancer immunotherapy.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Z-VAD-fmk (a pan-caspase inhibitor) was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc.

Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG and anti-goat IgG were purchased from ZhongShan Co. (Beijing, China).ELISA—ELISA plates (Costar) were coated with 5 μg/ml His-DR4, His-DR5, or His-DR5-ΔL2 and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. Plates were then incubated with 100 μl/well of mAbs (or hybridoma culture supernatants) at the required dilutions. The bound mAbs were detected with 100 μl/well of horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse IgG. For the binding of rsTRAIL, plates were incubated with 100 μl/well of rsTRAIL.

RIP-deficient Jurkat cells were kindly provided by Dr. Brian Seed (Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Normal human hepatocytes were provided by the Cancer Institute and Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China). Normal human primary peripheral blood lymphocytes cells were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. Tumor cell lines and primary cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Hybridomas were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics as described above. Cell viability was determined using CellTiter 96 AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (MTS) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Z-VAD-fmk or PMA was added 30 min before the addition of stimulants.Generation of AD5–10—4-Week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized 4 times with 50 μg of DR5 extracellular domain protein at 2-week intervals. Three days after the final boost, lymphocytes from spleen were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells (ATCC), and positive hybridomas were screened against DR5 and His-DR5 recombinant protein using ELISA. The selected mAbs were further tested for their tumoricidal activity.Annexin-V and Propidium Iodide Staining—Cells after the indicated treatment were stained using the annexin-V kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioSea Biotech Co., Beijing, China). Briefly, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and stained in 200 μl of binding buffer containing annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate for 30 min on ice. Propidium iodide was then added into the buffer. 5 min later 300 μl of binding buffer was added. The samples were analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACScan, BD Biosciences). 10,000 cells were counted per sample.Western Blot Analysis—After the required treatments, cells (2–3 × 106) were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the sample buffer (80–120 μl) for SDS-PAGE and immediately boiled for 5 min. Each sample was subjected to 8, 10, or 12% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins separated in the gel were subsequently electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 8 g/liter NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1–2 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with the indicated primary antibodies in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was washed 3 times with TBS-T and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1.5–2 h. After washing four times with TBS-T, the protein was visualized using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).Analysis of Tumoricidal Activity in Vivo—6–8-Week-old female BALB/c nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with SMMC-7721 cells (2 × 106). Three weeks later, after the indicated treatment, the mice were sacrificed, and the growth of tumor cells was determined by the weight of the tumor mass. 6–8-Week-old female BALB/c nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with A549 cells (2 × 106). One month later, after the indicated treatment, the mice were sacrificed, and the growth of tumor cells was determined by the weight of the tumor mass. Construction of Casp-8-DN Jurkat Cells—Jurkat cells were transfected with Casp-8-DN plasmid using the cell line Nucleofector kit V (Amaxa Biosystem) according to the manufacturer's instructions and screened with G418 (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA).Electron Microscopy—After the indicated treatment cells were fixed by dropwise addition of glutaraldehyde and analyzed according to standard procedures.DNA Fragmentation Assay—After the required treatments, 2 × 106 cells were collected and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were then subjected to digestion with ribonuclease A (0.2 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation with proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37°C.DNA in the sample was precipitated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C after treatment with 50% isopropyl alcohol and 0.5 m NaCl overnight at –20 °C. DNA was resuspended in 30 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel in the presence of 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide.NF-κB Activation Assay—The NF-κB reporter plasmid was constructed as previously described (25Wang M. Liu Y. Liu S. Zheng D. Oncol. Rep. 2004; 12: 193-199PubMed Google Scholar). The two primers, p1 (5′-GCGAGCTCGGGACTTTCCGGGACTTTCCGGGACT-3′, containing SacI cut site (underlined)) and p2, 5′-CCGCTCGAGGGAAAGTCCCGGAAGTCCCGGAAAG-3′, containing XhoI cut site (underlined)) were synthesized by BioAsia Co. (Shanghai, China). The overlapped sequences in the primers are indicated in italics. The primers were annealed to each other and amplified using PCR. The product corresponding to the three repeats of NF-κB DNA binding sequence was then cut with SacI and XhoI restriction endonucleases and inserted into the polyclonal sites of pGL2 plasmid (Promega). The recombinant plasmid was designated as pGL2-NF-κB. Cells were transfected with pGL2-NF-κB using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal count of transfected cells were treated, and luciferase activity in the cells was then determined using luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as mean values ± S.D.), and a Student's t test was used for evaluating statistical significance. p values were considered to be statistically significant when less than 0.05.RESULTSAD5–10 Binds to DR5 Specifically and Does Not Compete with TRAIL—Human DR5 has two isoforms, designated as DR5a and DR5b, which is a result of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. DR5b has an insertion of 29 amino acids in the extracellular domain compared with DR5a (26Screaton G.R. Mongkolsapaya J. Xu X.N. Cowper A.E. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 693-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). AD5–10 (IgG3-κ) was generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with a recombinant protein containing simply the extracellular domain of DR5a (amino acids 52–183), which was expressed in E. coli and without any exogenous sequence tags. In previous studies on anti-TRAIL receptor mAbs, DR4-Fc and DR5-Fc fusion proteins were usually used as antigens for immunizing animals (21Griffith T.S. Rauch C.T. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Boiani N.

We showed that the bacterially expressed DR4 and DR5 extracellular regions bound to their natural ligand, TRAIL, specifically (Fig. 1A), indicating that they are suitable for immunizing animals. There are two different TRAIL-binding sites on both DR4 and DR5 molecules (Kdhigh = 5–10 nm; Kdlow = 800–5000 nm) as previously described (5Degli-Esposti M.A. Smolak P.J. Walczak H. Waugh J.

Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1997; 7: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In contrast, AD5–10 bound to DR5 via one binding site (Kd = 0.30 nm) and did not react with DR4 and Fas (Fig. 1B). Notably, competitive ELISA showed that there was no competition between AD5–10 and TRAIL for binding to DR5 (Fig. 1, C and D). There are 7 disulfide bonds on the extracellular domain of DR5. The loop (amino acids 94–113) formed by the second disulfide bond (from the N terminus) has been demonstrated essential for DR5 to interact with TRAIL (27Hymowitz S.G. Christinger H.W. Fuh G. Ultsch M. O'Connell M. Kelley R.F. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). We expressed amino acids 94–113-deleted DR5 extracellular domain, designated as DR5-ΔL2 in E. coli, for the binding assay. The result showed that TRAIL did not bind to DR5-ΔL2, whereas AD5–10 bound to DR5-ΔL2 specifically (Fig. 1E), indicating that AD5–10 and TRAIL bound to different sites on DR5, raising the possibility that AD5–10 and TRAIL may trigger different downstream cell signals.AD5–10 Induces Apoptosis in Multiple Tumor Cell Lines in Vitro and Is Nontoxic to Human Normal Cells—Whether AD5–10 can kill tumor cells like TRAIL is what we are most interested in. Our results showed that AD5–10 and rsTRAIL strongly induced cell death in Jurkat cells. When treated with 100 ng/ml AD5–10, about 40% of Jurkat cells presented annexin-V positive after 1 h, and about 80% cells presented annexin-V positive after 2 h (Fig. 2, A and B). Cell viability was also tested using MTS kit (Promega). The IC50 (inhibitory concentration 50%) of Jurkat cells treated with AD5–10 for 8 h was less than 10 ng/ml (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, various tumor cell lines, SMMC-7721 (human hepatocellular carcinoma cells), HeLa cells, MDA-MB-231 (human breast adenocarcinoma cells), U251 (human glioma cells), and HCT-116 (colorectal carcinoma cells) were killed by AD5–10 as well as rsTRAIL in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, D and E). We noticed that Jurkat cells are more susceptible to AD5–10 than to rsTRAIL (Fig. 2, A–C), whereas apoptosis in HeLa cells were more easily induced by rsTRAIL (Fig. 2, D and E), which suggested that different mechanisms may be utilized by the two proteins. Nevertheless, these data demonstrated that both AD5–10 and rsTRAIL could efficiently induce cell death in various tumor cell lines in the absence of second cross-linking in vitro.FIGURE 2AD5–10 and rsTRAIL induced tumor cells but not normal cell apoptosis in vitro.

C, Jurkat cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of rsTRAIL or AD5–10 for 8 h. Cell viability was determined by an MTS assay. D and E, tumor cell lines were treated with the indicated concentrations of rsTRAIL (D) or AD5–10 (E) for 24 h. F and G, human normal hepatocytes were treated with the indicated concentrations of rsTRAIL (F) or AD5–10 (G) in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml CHX for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by an MTS assay. Results shown are the average of triplicate measurements and a representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Some versions of soluble TRAIL and some mAbs against TRAIL receptors were reported toxic to human normal hepatocytes, whereas others were demonstrated nontoxic. To test if AD5–10 has normal cell toxicity, we treated human hepatocytes with various concentrations of rsTRAIL or AD5–10 for 24 h. No decrease of cell viability was detected, as determined by MTS assay (Fig. 2, F and G). We also tested if cycloheximide (CHX), a potent apoptosis enhancer, could sensitize hepatocytes to TRAIL or AD5–10-induced cell death. A 24-h co-incubation with CHX and 10 ng/ml rsTRAIL caused a 40% decrease of hepatocyte viability. In contrast, no decrease of cell viability was detected in cultures exposed to both CHX and various concentrations of AD5–10 (Fig. 2, F and G). Our results showed that both rsTRAIL and AD5–10 were nontoxic to human hepatocytes and suggested that AD5–10 was relatively safer to human hepatocytes than TRAIL. In addition, rsTRAIL, AD5–10, or the combination of the two agents was also nontoxic to human primary peripheral blood lymphocytes (data not shown).Tumoricidal Activity of AD5–10 in Vivo—The tumoricidal activity of AD5–10 in vivo was tested using two tumor cell lines. BALB/c nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with SMMC-7721, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, or A549, a human lung carcinoma cell line. Both rsTRAIL and AD5–10 inhibited the SMMC-7721, forming solid tumors in early treatment or reduced tumor weight in late treatment significantly. The tumor weights were reduced 4–5-fold as compared with control treatments (Fig. 3 A and B). Tumor formation was completely invisible in 4 animals with AD5–10 early treatment (n = 10), and the tumors of 5 animals with AD5–10 late treatment completely disappeared (n = 10). An example from AD5–10-treated mice was shown along with one from control mice in Fig. 3C. Similarly, AD5–10 inhibited the growth of A549 cells in BALB/c nude mice (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that AD5–10 is a potent inhibitor of in vivo tumor cell growth. Injection with extremely high doses of rsTRAIL and AD5–10 (10-fold of the dose used in anti-tumor treatment experiments) to BALB/c mice caused no toxic reaction in liver, spleen, and kidney (data not shown).FIGURE 3Tumoricidal activity of AD5–10 in vivo. A and B, BALB/c nude mice were inoculated with SMMC-7721 cells and then injected with 3 doses of 100 μg of rsTRAIL, 3 doses of 100 μg of AD5–10, or a single dose of 1.2 mg CTX on the 2nd day (A) or the 8th day (B). Tumor growth was determined by weight. C, control mice (left) and mice with AD5–10 late treatment. D, BALB/c nude mice were inoculated with A549 cells and injected with a single dose or 3 doses of 100 μg of AD5–10 or a single dose of 0.8 mg of CTX on the 2nd day.

Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), but multiple lines of evidence indicate that StAR exerts its action on or in the OMM. First, deletion of 62 amino-terminal residues, including the leader peptide, results in a protein (N-62 StAR) that is confined to the cytoplasm but retains full activity, both in transfected cell systems and in isolated mitochondria in vitro (19Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss J.F. II I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3903-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Second, fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicate that StAR directly interacts with synthetic membranes (22Christensen K. Bose H.S. Harris F.M. Miller W.L. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17044-17051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Third, N-62 StAR promotes cholesterol transfer from synthetic vesicles lacking P450scc to those containing P450scc (23Tuckey R.C. Headlam M.J. Bose H.S. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47123-47128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fourth, affixing N-62 StAR to the cytoplasmic aspect of the OMM constitutively activates StAR, whereas localizing N-62 StAR to the intramembranous space or matrix side of IMM ablated all activity (11Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Fifth, in vitro mitochondrial protein import assays show that constructs that slow mitochondrial entry increase StAR activity and constructs that speed its entry decrease activity (11Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Thus, all direct experimental evidence indicates that StAR's site of action is the OMM. Finally, synthetic unilamellar vesicles having a lipid composition that models the OMM only protect StAR's carboxyl-terminal α-helix (C-helix) from proteolysis, implying that when StAR interacts with the OMM, most of the protein remains exposed to the cytoplasm (15Yaworsky D.C. Baker B.Y. Bose H.S. Best K.B. Jensen L.B. Bell J.D. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2045-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Spectral data and partial proteolysis indicate that StAR undergoes a structural transition to a molten globule at low pH in solution (24Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7250-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and in association with synthetic membranes (22Christensen K.

Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have proposed that this conformational change is induced in vivo by StAR's interaction with protonated phospholipid head groups of the OMM and is required for StAR activity (11Bose H.S.

This conformational change is apparently associated with the spectroscopic changes interpreted as a molten globule (24Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7250-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the molten globule model of StAR's action has been controversial. Therefore, we have sought direct evidence for the potential involvement of the molten globule structural transition in StAR activity. We now show that the conformational changes that have previously been characterized as a molten globule transition (24Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7250-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) are required for StAR activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSMolecular Dynamics (MD)—The parallel MD program AMBER7 using the amber force field ff94 (28Cornell W.D.

Programs were run on the socrates host of a Hewlett-Packard AlphaSever mainframe that includes a 32-processor GS1280 and four 4-processor ES45s. The model of human N-62 StAR (15Yaworsky D.C. Baker B.Y. Bose H.S. Best K.B. Jensen L.B. Bell J.D. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. J. Biol.

Images of the model were generated with the program Chimera (45Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (26714) Google Scholar). We used periodic boundary simulations based on the particle mesh Ewald method (AMBER 7), and the nonbonded cutoff, which is used to limit the direct space sum for particle mesh Ewald, was set at default value (8 Å). The system was subjected to a steepest descent energy minimization (1000 steps) with positional restraints on the protein and second minimization (1000 steps) on the whole system. At minimization convergence, the whole system was heated to 300 K over 100 ps, and another 100 ps equilibration was performed under constant pressure with the restraints switched off to allow the water box to relax. The whole system was then subjected to a 3-ns production MD run, (1.5 × 108 steps at 2 fs/step). The system energy, temperature, and pressure were checked before and after each MD run.Protein Preparation—Wild-type full-length StAR DNA cloned into pTWIN1 (New England Biolabs Inc.) (a gift from X. Chen) was modified by deleting the region encoding the first 62 residues and adding an amino-terminal His6 tag fused to the Ssp DnaB intein domain at StAR's amino terminus and then cloned into the SapI and BamHI sites. The carboxyl-terminal Cys-285 residue was mutated to Phe, and the SapI site in the cDNA was mutated to facilitate cloning, yielding pTWIN-N-His6-N-62 StAR. Transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (New England Biolabs) grown in Luria broth were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h and stored at -80 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 500 mm NaCl. Bacteria were lysed by sonication and cleared of debris, and the supernatant was filtered (0.45 μm) before loading onto chitin-binding columns (New England Biolabs). The columns were prepared, loaded, washed, and eluted according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Protein was collected, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and concentrated using 15 ml of ultrafiltration cells with YM10MWC membrane (Amicon, Inc). Protein concentration was estimated at A280; the molar extinction coefficient of His6-N-62 StAR is 1.034 mg-1 cm-1 calculated from the amino acid sequence using the ProtParam program, ExPASy. Free sulfhydryl groups were titrated at 412 nm with 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoate) at pH 7.5 in the absence and presence of 2% SDS (Ellman's reagent instructions, Pierce). The N-62 StAR mutants S100C/S261C (SS) and D106C/A268C (DA) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, sequenced, and expressed as above.Mass Spectrometry—Bands of purified wild-type, SS, and DA mutant N-62 StAR were excised from SDS-PAGE gels and diced into ∼1 mm3 pieces. Samples were destained twice with 100 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 in 50% acetonitrile to eliminate formation of spurious disulfides (29Sechi S. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 5150-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac centrifuge, and reacted with 50 μl of 55 mm iodoacetamide in 25 mm NH4HCO3 for 1 h at 20° C in the dark. After removing the supernatant, the gel pieces were evaporated to dryness, digested with 10 μl of 12.5 ng/μl sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), and extracted with 50 μl of 5% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile and then sonicated for 30 min. The supernatant was evaporated nearly to dryness and dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% formic acid. A 1-μl aliquot was chromatographed on a 1100 nano-high pressure liquid chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using a 75 μm × 15 cm, 5-μm particle size C-18 column (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA) and eluted in 0.1% formic acid with a 30-min linear gradient of 5-60% acetonitrile flowing at 5 μl/min. The effluent was routed into a QSTAR (o)-TOF MS (ABI, Foster City, CA) operated in electrospray positive mode. Data were acquired in IDA-mode scanning from 305 to 1400 m/z, low Q1 resolution, 25-V collision voltage, with a time-of-flight m/z range of 50-2000 for the MS/MS acquisition.Spectroscopy—Protein samples were diluted to 0.3 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and CD spectroscopy was performed at room temperature in a 1-mm path length cuvette in a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. For pH studies, samples were dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer at the desired pH and clarified at 10,000 × g for 10 min to eliminate aggregates, and the protein concentrations were determined following the CD spectroscopy. Each spectrum represents the average of at least five accumulations with subtraction of the appropriate background. Each experiment was repeated three times, and the spectra from each experiment were averaged and converted to mean residue ellipticity (Θ). Secondary structure compositions were estimated using the three computational tools in CDPro (30Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). Analysis with CONTIN (31Povencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar) yielded the lowest normalized root mean square deviation score; thus, data are portrayed with this program. Protein samples (0.5 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline were excited at 280 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 360 to 500 nm on a Spectra Max M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Each experiment was performed three times, and the fluorescence spectra were averaged.Cholesterol Binding—N-62 StAR (0.5 μm) in phosphate-buffered saline was mixed with various amounts of NBD-cholesterol 22-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3β-ol) (Molecular Probes Inc.) in 96-well plates (final volume 200 μl) incubated 15 min at 37 °C, and steady state fluorescence was monitored on a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader. NBD-cholesterol was excited at 460 nm, and emission was recorded at 534 nm. Data were analyzed by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 plotting NBD-cholesterol concentration versus the relative fluorescence.Steroidogenic Activity—MA-10 cell mitochondria were isolated (11Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), suspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and stored at -80 °C. About 1 μg of mitochondrial protein (Bradford method) was incubated with wild-type or mutant N-62 StAR at 37 °C for 60 min in 125 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm HEPES, 250 ng/ml trilostane, 100 μm GTP, 10 mm isocitrate with or without 1 mm DTT. Conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone was determined by radioimmunoassay.RESULTSMolecular Dynamics Simulations—We previously reported a computational model of human N-62 StAR (15Yaworsky D.C.

Huang M.C. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11722-11731Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), similar to StAR (24Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7250-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The model closely resembles the structures of N-216 MLN64 (12Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and StarD4 (13Romanowski M.J. Soccio R.E. Breslow J.L. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), scores favorably in the programs PROCHECK and WHATIF, and has a calculated free energy of -4.3 × 103 kcal/mol, which is similar to the value of -5.9 × 103 kcal/mol calculated based on the coordinates of the N-216 MLN64 crystal structure (Fig. 1A).Models and crystal structures yield rigid representations, analogous to visualizing the protein at 0 K. To visualize the movement of the protein in solution at 300 K, we “hydrated” the model of human N-62 StAR in silico by adding 9631 water molecules as a 73.6 × 71.8 × 77.1 Å box so that there is at least 10 Å between any atom in StAR and the edge of the box. Following energy minimization, the system was heated from 0 to 300 K over 100 ps and equilibrated for 100 ps, and then 3-ns MD runs were performed encompassing 1.5 × 108 molecular steps at 2 fs/step. The output files were written every 500 steps (1 ps) and the trajectory files were saved every 5000 steps, yielding 300 structures for each simulation.MD runs were done under three computational conditions. First, all residues were left in their charged states (the “default” settings of the program) to model pH 7 (“neutral” conditions). Second, all Asp, Glu, and His residues were protonated to model acidic conditions near pH 4 (“acidic” conditions). Third, only the Asp, Glu, and His residues in the C-helix and in the adjacent Ω1 and Ω3 loops were protonated to model a neutral StAR molecule interacting with an acidified membrane (“acidified C-helix” conditions). The total energy under each condition remained stable during the MD runs (Fig. 1B). At neutral pH, the model showed stable trajectories with conserved secondary and tertiary structures, but when acidic conditions were modeled, StAR had a partially opened tertiary structure. The distal end of the carboxyl-terminal helix became unfolded further, and the Ω1 loop and C-helix moved away from each other, opening and closing the SBP. Measurements of the Cα root mean square deviation showed that StAR is more labile under the two acidic conditions (Fig. 1C). The C-helix and Ω1 loop are closely associated; the distances between either of the resonating guanidino nitrogens of Arg-272 and either of the carboxylic oxygens of Asp-106 are 2.8 ± 0.1 Å under neutral conditions, favoring the formation of two hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1D).To visualize the movement of the C-helix, we superimposed images of the molecule obtained every 100 ps, and we plotted the distances between key pairs of atoms during MD (Fig. 2). The distance between the carboxyl carbon (Cγ) of Asp-106 in the Ω1 loop to the guanidino carbon (Cζ) of Arg-272 remained stable at 4 Å under neutral conditions, whereas under either acidic or acidified C-helix conditions, this distance fluctuated dramatically, reaching >10 Å (Fig. 2C, top). This indicates that the C-helix and Ω1 loop move dramatically with respect to one another, opening and closing the SBP. Similar hydrogen bonding was seen between Glu-136 and Arg-274 in the static model at neutral pH. This distance varied from 4 to 6 Å during MD at neutral pH but was relatively more stable under acidic conditions, particularly when only the C-helix was acidified (Fig. 2C, bottom). Thus, acidic pH had little effect (or even a stabilizing effect) on the distance between Arg-274 in the C-helix and Glu-136 in the short α2 helix that contributes to the roof of the SBP. Therefore, cholesterol is more likely to reach the SBP via a space between the Ω1 loop and the C-helix than between the Ω3 loop and the C-helix.FIGURE 2Movement of the StAR molecule during molecular dynamics. A, Cα superposition of conformations from MD snapshots every 100 ps over the 3-ns simulations at neutral (left panel), acidic (middle panel), and acidified C-helix (right panel) conditions. The protein is dynamic, particularly in the distal ends and the loop regions, but the overall structure is well maintained at neutral and acidic pHs. At low pH, conformation transitions are particularly prominent at the Ω1 region. B, interatomic distances (in Å) between Arg-272 and Asp-106 as a function of time during molecular dynamics simulations. The carboxyl carbon (Cγ) of Arg-106 in the Ω1 loop is bonded to two oxygen atoms, termed Oδ1 and Oδ2, and the guanidino carbon (Cζ) of Arg-272 in the C-helix is covalently bonded to two nitrogen atoms, termed Nω1 and Nω2. The distances are plotted between these atoms and shown as follows: in red,Oδ1/Nω2; green,Oδ1/Nω1; black,Oδ2/Nω1; and yellow,Oδ2/Nω2. Under neutral conditions, the Oδ1/Nω2 and Oδ2/Nω1 distances are 2.8 ± 0.1 Å, favoring hydrogen bonding; pairings of Oδ1/Nω1 and Oδ2/Nω2 are less likely. Upper panel, neutral; middle panel, acidic; lower panel, acidified C-helix. C, interatomic distances during MD. Top, distance (in Å) between Cζ in Arg-272 and Cγ in Arg-106.

To test the hypothesis that movement of the C-helix is required for StAR's activity, we sought to immobilize this helix in the position identified by the modeling and by the MD under neutral conditions. We systematically modeled the effects of changing residues in the C-helix and adjacent loops to Cys, seeking pairs in which the side chains were ∼ 4 Å apart, and then mutated them to Cys in silico. We identified two pairs of residues, S100C/S261C (SS) and D106C/A268C (DA), which, when changed to Cys, positioned their sulfhydryl groups to form disulfide bonds without"

We previously demonstrated that PEN-2 is critical for promoting endoproteolysis of PS1 and that the proximal two-thirds of transmembrane domain (TMD) 1 of PEN-2 is required for binding with PS1. In this study, we sought to identify the structural domains of PS1 that are necessary for binding with PEN-2. To address this issue, we generated a series of constructs encoding PS1 mutants harboring deletions or replacements of specific TMDs of PS1-NTF, and examined the effects of encoded molecules on interactions with PEN-2, stabilization and endoproteolysis of PS1, and γ-secretase activity. We now show that PS1 TMDs 1 and 2 and the intervening hydrophilic loop are dispensable for binding to PEN-2. Furthermore, analysis of chimeric PS1 molecules that harbor replacements of each TMD with corresponding transmembrane segments from the sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage activating protein (SCAP) revealed that the PS1-SCAP TMD4 mutant failed to coimmunoprecipitate endogenous PEN-2, strongly suggesting that the fourth TMD of PS1 is required for interaction with PEN-2.

The demonstration that coexpression of these four molecules in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an organism lacking any endogenous γ-secretase activity, is sufficient to reconstitute γ-secretase activity (3Edbauer D.

Several lines of evidence have emerged to indicate that the steady-state accumulation of each of the components of the complex is coordinately regulated, and in large part, dependent on the expression of other members of the complex (for review, see Ref. 4Periz G. Fortini M.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although the precise functional role of the individual components of the γ-secretase complex is still not clear, APH-1 and NCT apparently form a stable subcomplex that binds to, and stabilizes, newly synthesized PS1 (5LaVoie M.J.

At present, little information is available pertaining to the mechanism(s) by which PEN-2 promotes the endoproteolysis of PS1. Identification of the binding sites for the molecular interactions between PS1 fragments and the other complex components have been topics of intense investigation. For example, mutational analyses of NCT and APH-1 have revealed that the proximal one-third of the lone transmembrane domain (TMD) of NCT and the GXXXG motif of the TMD4 of APH-1 are critical for formation of the γ-secretase complex (17Capell A.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4738-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal end of PS1 is necessary for interactions with the TMD of NCT. Very recently, we showed that the proximal two-thirds of the TMD1 of PEN-2 is critical for binding with PS1 and promoting PS1 endoproteolysis (14Kim S.H. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1992-2001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the domain of PS1 that interacts with PEN-2 has remained unclear. Presenilins are polytopic membrane proteins with 10 predicted hydrophobic segments. The most widely accepted topology model for PS1 is one in which the molecule spans the membrane eight times with amino and carboxyl termini as well as the large hydrophilic loop between TMDs 6 and 7 being cytosolic (21Doan A. Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Slunt H.H. Ratovitsky T. Podlisny M. Selkoe D.J. Seeger M. Gandy S.E. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

A. 1998; 95: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have offered support for a 9-TMD model for PS1 in which the carboxyl terminus is luminal (23Laudon H. Hansson E.M. Melen K. Bergman A. Farmery M.R. Winblad B. Lendahl U. von Heijne G. Naslund J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35352-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the differences in the topology models, PS1 endoproteolysis unequivocally occurs within the large hydrophilic loop to generate stable NTF and CTF derivatives. Recent studies have revealed that solubilization of the γ-secretase complex in 1% dodecyl β-d-maltoside results in the formation of smaller, heterogeneous complexes; one of these contains NCT, APH-1, and PS1-CTF, whereas the other consists of PS1-NTF and PEN-2 (24Fraering P.C. LaVoie M.J. Ye W. Ostaszewski B.L. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggested that PS1-NTF associates with PEN-2. In the present study, we sought to identify a domain within the PS1-NTF that is required for binding with PEN-2. To address this issue, we generated a series of constructs encoding PS1 mutants harboring deletions or replacements of specific TMDs of PS1-NTF and tested the effects of these variants on the interaction with PEN-2, stabilization and endoproteolysis of PS1, and γ-secretase activity. We now show that TMDs 1 and 2 of PS1 and the intervening hydrophilic loop are dispensable for binding to PEN-2. Furthermore, analysis of chimeric PS1 molecules that harbor replacements of each transmembrane segment with topologically oriented transmembrane segments from the SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP) revealed that the PS1-SCAP TMD4 mutant failed to coimmunoprecipitate endogenous PEN-2. These results strongly suggest that the fourth TMD of PS1 is required for interaction with PEN-2. We successfully “rescued” PEN-2 binding, PS1 endoproteolysis, and γ-secretase activity of the PS1-SCAP TMD4 mutant by replacing SCAP sequences with varying segments of the authentic PS1 TMD4. These studies culminated with the finding that the “NF” motif within TMD4 of PS1 is critical for binding with PEN-2, promoting PS1 endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity.

Lysates were subject to Tris/glycine or 16.5% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE and fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) prior to incubation with selected antibodies.

Lysates were subject to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and the resulting supernatant fraction containing detergent-solubilized proteins was used for coimmunoprecipitation studies. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with respective antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were collected with Protein A-conjugated agarose beads (Pierce) and eluted by incubation at 50 °C for 15 min in Laemmli SDS sample buffer.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) showed that solubilization of the γ-secretase complex with 1% dodecyl β-d-maltoside resulted in the generation of four heterogeneous complexes. Second-dimensional analysis of the complexes revealed that one complex consisted of nicastrin, APH-1, and PS1-CTF, whereas the other contained PS1-NTF and PEN-2 (24Fraering P.C. LaVoie M.J. Ye W.

These results strongly suggested that the PS1-NTF is involved in binding with PEN-2. To identify a domain within the PS1-NTF to which PEN-2 binds, we first examined the PS1 ΔM1,2 mutant that harbors a deletion of TMDs 1 and 2 of PS1 and the intervening hydrophilic loop (Fig. 1A). This mutant has been reported to have a dominant-negative effect on γ-secretase activity (31Murphy M.P. Uljon S.N. Fraser P.E. Fauq A. Lookingbill H.A. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Lewis P.A.

We explored the possibility that the loss-of-function phenotype of the ΔM1,2 mutant might be because of inability of this mutant to associate with PEN-2. To test this hypothesis, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using stable N2a or 293 cell lines that stably express wild type PS1, the ΔM1,2 PS1 mutant (32Leem J.Y. Saura C.A. Pietrzik C.

CHAPS-solubilized lysates of these cell lines were subject to immunoprecipitation with either PS1NT antibody (11Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L.

As expected, PS1NT antibody immunoprecipitated both full-length PS1 and PS1-NTF from cells expressing wild type PS1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 7). Moreover, both ΔM1,2 and D385A PS1 mutants accumulated as holoproteins and these mutant proteins were also immunoprecipitated by the PS1NT antibody (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 8). As previously described (8Luo W.J. Wang H. Li H. Kim B.S. Shah S. Lee H.J. Thinakaran G. Kim T.W. Yu G. Xu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7850-7854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 14Kim S.H. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1992-2001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), endogenous PEN-2 was coimmunoprecipitated with wild type PS1 under these conditions (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 7). Notably, endogenous PEN-2 was also coimmunoprecipitated with either the ΔM1,2 or D385A PS1 mutants (Fig. 1C, lanes 6 and 8). We confirmed these findings using the PNT-2 antibody for immunoprecipitation. We show that PNT-2 antibody coimmunoprecipitates not only wild type PS1 holoprotein, and PS1-NTF (Fig. 1B, lanes 9 and 11), but also the unprocessed ΔM1,2 and D385A PS1 mutant proteins (Fig. 1B, lanes 10 and 12, respectively). To establish the specificity of the coimmunoprecipitation assay, we examined the association of PEN-2 with the ΔM1,2 or D385A PS1 mutants using an antibody, termed ABri, raised against a sequence contained within BRI, an unrelated membrane protein. We now show that the ABri antibody coimmunoprecipitated neither endogenous PEN-2 nor the ΔM1,2 PS1 mutant (Fig. 1D, lane 3), suggesting that the observed interaction between the ΔM1,2 PS1 mutant and PEN-2 is not a result of nonspecific hydrophobic interactions between these molecules. Collectively, these results indicate that a domain of PS1 that includes TMDs 1 and 2 and the intervening hydrophilic loop are dispensable for binding to PEN-2. Identification of PS1 TMD4 as the PEN-2 Interacting Domain—Having ruled out TMDs 1 and 2 of PS1 as PEN-2 binding sites, we turned our attention to TMDs 3–6 in the PS1-NTF. For these studies, we generated constructs that encode chimeras in which each TMD of PS1 was replaced with a corresponding domain of an unrelated, polytopic membrane protein, SCAP. Maintaining the topological orientation of each TMDs, we replaced PS1 TMD3 or TMD5 with the SCAP TMD2 and substituted PS1 TMD4 or TMD6 with the SCAP TMD1 (see Fig. 2A). We stably transfected these PS1-SCAP TMD replacement mutant constructs (TMD3, TMD4, TMD5, and TMD6), as well as wild type human PS1 cDNA into PS1-deficient fibroblasts. Western blot analyses of detergent lysates from these stable cell lines with PS1NT antibody revealed that among the four chimeras tested, only the TMD3 PS1-SCAP mutant was subject to endoproteolytic processing to generate NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments (line TMD3.1; Fig. 2B, lane 3), whereas the other three chimeras (TMD4, TMD5, and TMD6 mutants) accumulated as full-length proteins (lines TMD4.6, TMD5.6, and TMD6.53, respectively; Fig. 2B, lanes 4–6, respectively). Earlier studies have shown that in the absence of the stabilizing effects of PS1, the steady-state levels of endogenous PEN-2 are markedly diminished in PS1-deficient mouse fibroblasts, and this phenotype is rescued by expression of human PS1 (33Steiner H. Winkler E. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Basset G. Yamasaki A. Kostka M. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39062-39065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To examine whether expression of PS1-SCAP TMD replacement mutants could also “rescue” the loss of PEN-2 expression in PS1-deficient fibroblasts, we examined the PEN-2 levels in the same detergent lysates of these stable cell lines by immunoblot analysis with PNT-2 antibody. Consistent with earlier reports (33Steiner H. Winkler E. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Basset G. Yamasaki A. Kostka M. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39062-39065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), the level of endogenous PEN-2 in PS1–/– fibroblasts was markedly increased by overexpression of wild type human PS1 (Fig. 2C, compare “vector” lanes 1 and 7 to 2, respectively). Interestingly, in cells expressing the TMD3 or TMD6 chimeras, the steady-state levels of PEN-2 were also significantly elevated and at levels comparable with that seen in cells expressing wild type PS1 (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 3 and 6 versus 2). In contrast, we saw a slight, but reproducible elevation in PEN-2 levels in cells expressing the PS1-SCAP TMD5 mutant, but no such rescue with the TMD4 mutant, compared with cells expressing wild type PS1 (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 5 and 4, respectively versus 2). The failure of the PS1-SCAP TMD4 or TMD5 mutants to rescue PEN-2 levels could be explained by the instability of these variants. To test this notion, we treated parallel dishes of cells from each stable PS1–/– fibroblast line with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, and assessed the levels of full-length PS1 and PS1 fragments over time (Fig. 3). Consistent with several earlier reports (reviewed in Ref. 34Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Annu. Rev.

Similarly, the TMD3 PS1-SCAP mutant holoprotein was degraded rapidly, whereas the endoproteolytic derivatives were quite stable (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–8). In contrast, both the PS1-SCAP TMD6 and the PS1-SCAP TMD4 mutant proteins that accumulate as unprocessed, full-length species, were quite stable (Fig. 3, A, lanes 9–12 and B, lanes 4–6). However, and for reasons that are presently unclear, the unprocessed PS1-SCAP TMD5 mutant was extremely unstable (Fig. 3A, lanes 13–16). Nevertheless, this result would explain the fact that PEN-2 levels are only slightly elevated in cells expressing this mutant (see Fig. 2C). We should note that in the stable cell lines, all four PS1-SCAP mutants were coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies raised against NCT (data not shown), findings consistent with earlier reports that the PS1-nicastrin interaction is mediated by a domain of PS1 very near the carboxyl terminus (20Kaether C.

To examine the interaction of the PS1-SCAP mutants with endogenous PEN-2, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments.

By using a micropipette, we measured the conformational regulation of two-dimensional (2D) binding affinity and the kinetics of cell-bound intercellular adhesion molecule-1 interacting with αLβ2 or isolated I domain expressed on K562 cells. Locking the I domain into open and intermediate conformations with a disulfide bond increased the affinities by ∼8000- and ∼30-fold, respectively, from the locked closed conformation, which has similar affinity as the wild-type I domain. Most surprisingly, the 2D affinity increases were due mostly to the 2D on-rate increases, as the 2D off-rates only decreased by severalfold. The wild-type αLβ2, but not its I domain in isolation, could be up-regulated by Mn2+ or Mg2+ to have high affinities and on-rates. Locking the I domain in any of the three conformations abolished the ability of divalent cations to regulate 2D affinity. These results indicate that a downward displacement of the I domain C-terminal helix, induced by conformational changes of other domains of the αLβ2, is required for affinity and on-rate up-regulation.

Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, or αLβ2 integrin, mediates a variety of leukocyte adhesion and signaling processes, such as firm adhesion to the vascular surface during the initiation of inflammatory reaction or during lymphocyte trafficking, transendothelial migration into inflamed tissues or lymphoid tissues (1Springer T.A.

Ligand binding of inactive αLβ2 is of too low an affinity to be detected by many conventional methods, but high affinity can be induced by cell activation, a process referred to as inside-out signaling. Conformational changes in the αLβ2 molecule, especially in the inserted (I) domain, are required for such affinity up-regulation. Ligand binding to the I domain can also induce conformational changes that propagate from the integrin head to its tail to enable binding of cytoplasmic molecules, a process referred to as outside-in signaling. Thus, conformational changes are crucial to the regulation of integrin functions (3Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

The ligand-binding site of αLβ2 for ICAM-1 is located at the I domain in the αL subunit, which is so named because its ∼200 amino acids are inserted between blades 2 and 3 of the β-propeller domain (6Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The I domain is also named αA domain because it assumes a dinucleotide-binding fold with a central β-sheet surrounded by several α helices that is similar to the A domains of von Willebrand factor (7Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1991; 77: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C and N termini on one face connect the I domain to the β-propeller domain. A metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) is located on the opposite face, which, together with the surrounding residues, forms the ICAM-1-binding site. Crystallographic (8Shimaoka M. Xiao T.

It has been proposed that three residues of the β6-α7 loop interact with the α1 helix one at a time to hold the α7 helix in three distinct positions that correspond to these three conformations; each position moves the α7 helix downward by one helical turn (8Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The movement of the α7 helix is linked to a repacking of the hydrophobic face of this α helix, which is coupled to the structural rearrangement of the MIDAS and divalent cation coordination (Fig. 1A). The regulation of ligand binding affinity and kinetics of αLβ2 by conformational changes has been examined by using mutants that introduce a pair of cysteines to form a disulfide bond to lock the αL I domain in either the closed, intermediate, or open conformation by altering the α7 helix position (8Shimaoka M.

The isolated locked I domain mutants exhibited low (6.3 × 102 m-1), intermediate (3.3 × 105 m-1), and high (6.7 × 106 m-1) three-dimensional (3D) affinities for ICAM-1 as measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (8Shimaoka M.

The increase in on-rate (∼50–60-fold) and the decrease in off-rate (∼100–250-fold) both contributed to the increase in binding affinity from the locked closed to the locked open I domains. The isolated locked open I domain was sufficient for full adhesive activity, since it had a 3D binding affinity for ICAM-1 (and mediated ICAM-1-dependent cell adhesion) at a level similar to those of fully activated wild-type (WT) αLβ2 (12Lu C.

Ligand binding in the I domain can be regulated by and can induce a series of intra- and inter-domain conformational changes, which propagate through other domains from the cytoplasmic tail to the I domain (inside-out signaling) or from the I domain to the cytoplasmic tail (outside-in signaling). It has been proposed that, prior to the initiation of inside-out signaling, the inactive integrin assumes a bent conformation. Binding of an intracellular protein (e.g. talin) to the integrin cytoplasmic domain may result in the separation of the α- and β-cytoplasmic/transmembrane domains, thereby destabilizing the extracellular interface between the two subunits. This may lead to a switchblade-like opening of the bent integrin, resulting in an extended conformation. The disruption of the subunit interface may enable the hybrid domain to swing out from the I-like domain in the β subunit, facilitating the downward movement of the I-like domain C-terminal α helix that may be coupled to a rearrangement in the MIDAS of the I-like domain (Fig. 1B) (15Luo B.H.

An “intrinsic ligand,” a residue in the I domain α7 helix, may bind the activated I-like domain MIDAS (18Alonso J.L. Essafi M. Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Arnaout M.A. Curr.

This binding may pull down the α7 helix of the I domain and convert it to the activated conformation for high affinity ligand binding (20Takagi J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Although various lines of evidence have been obtained in support of the above models for affinity/kinetic regulation by conformational changes, previous measurements were made by SPR with one of the binding partners in the fluid phase, i.e. 3D kinetics and affinity 4Strictly speaking, 3D binding requires both binding partners in the fluid phase. However, binding in SPR experiments, like binding of soluble ligands to cell surface receptors, is quite similar to and has the same binding affinity and on-rate units as the true 3D binding.

By comparison, cell-cell adhesion and cell-substrate adhesion are mediated by binding between receptors and ligands anchored on two apposing surfaces, i.e. two-dimensional (2D) interactions. The binding affinity Ka is the ratio of equilibrium concentration of bonds to those of free receptors and ligands. However, concentration is measured as number of molecules per volume in 3D but number of molecules per area (i.e. surface density) in 2D, resulting in different units for Ka (m-1 in 3D and μm2 in 2D). The kinetic on-rate kon also has different units in different dimensions (m-1 s-1 in 3D and μm2 s-1 in 2D). The 2D kon is the rate of bond formation between unit densities of receptors and ligands that are respectively anchored on two apposing surfaces of unit area. By comparison, the 3D kon is the rate of bond formation between unit concentrations of receptors and ligands in solution of unit volume. There has been increasing recognition that 2D binding parameters cannot be readily converted from their 3D counterparts (21Dustin M.L. Bromley S.K. Davis M.M. Zhu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to directly measure in situ the more physiologically relevant 2D binding affinity and kinetic rates. Here we quantified the regulation of 2D binding affinity and kinetics of the αLβ2-ICAM-1 interaction by conformational changes using the micropipette adhesion frequency experiment (22Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Our results showed that when expressed on the cell surface, isolated locked I domains exhibited binding affinities and kinetics similar to those of whole αLβ2 integrins containing I domains locked in the corresponding conformations. Up-regulation of ligand binding affinity of the αLβ2 was mostly because of the conformational changes in the I domain, which in turn was regulated by other domains by pulling down the I domain C-terminal α7 helix. Our data also revealed a surprising discrepancy between the 2D and 3D off-rate measurements. The 2D off-rates of the locked open and locked closed I domains only differed a few fold, which is in sharp contrast to the 3D results of ∼100-fold difference.

Approximately 7 ml of whole blood was collected by venipuncture into sterile Vacutainers (BD Biosciences) containing EDTA. This was carefully layered over 3 ml of Histopaque 1119 (Sigma) and centrifuged (30 min, 2000 × g, room temperature). The supernatant was removed, and the pelleted RBCs were washed once in RBC storage solution (EAS45) (23Dumaswala U.J. Wilson M.J. Jose T. Daleke D.L.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-human αL I domain monoclonal antibody (mAb) MEM-25 (IgG1) (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and a nonbinding FITC-conjugated mouse isotype-matched control antibody were used to determine surface expression of the I domain and αLβ2 on K562 cells by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. FITC-conjugated mouse mAb MEM-111 (Caltag Laboratories) and FITC-conjugated rat mAb YN1/1.7.4 (eBioscience, San Diego) were used to determine the site densities of the reconstituted human and mouse ICAM-1, respectively. The mouse anti-human αL mAb 38 (Ancell, Bayport, MN) was used for antibody-antigen adhesion kinetic measurement. FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG2a mAb (Fc-specific) (Pharmingen) was used to measure the site density of mAb 38 coated on RBCs. The anti-ICAM-1-capturing mouse mAb CA7 was a generous gift of Dr. Robert Rothlein (Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Ridgefield, CT). The integrin-activating mAb CBR LFA1/2 has been described previously (25Petruzzelli L. Maduzia L. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 854-866PubMed Google Scholar). Coupling of ICAM-1 to RBCs—Mouse or human GPI-ICAM-1 was reconstituted in RBC membrane by a 2.5-h incubation with different concentrations to achieve the desired site densities (26Williams T.E. Nagarajan S. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13283-13288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Capture antibody CA7 or anti-human αL I domain mAb 38 was covalently coupled to the membranes of RBCs by the chromium chloride (CrCl3) method described previously (22Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). CA7-coated RBCs were subsequently washed and incubated with human ICAM-1. Coated RBCs were washed and assayed for coating density by flow cytometry and stored in EAS45 at 4 °C. Cell Sorting and Site Density Determination—Sorting of K562 cells to express several narrowly distributed densities (with the mean ranging from 10 to 2000 μm-2) of isolated I domains and whole αLβ2 were done using a BD FACSVantage SE flow cytometer (Immunocytometry Systems). Molecular site densities on the cell surface were determined by flow cytometry. For the isolated I domain and αLβ2 site densities, K562 cells were incubated with FITC MEM-25 (or isotype-matched FITC mouse control antibody) for 30 min at room temperature. For mouse and human ICAM-1 site densities, RBCs with and without (for controls) ICAM-1 coupling were incubated with FITC YN1/1.7.4 and FITC MEM-111, respectively. For mAb 38 site density, RBCs with and without (for controls) mAb 38 coupling were incubated with FITC rat anti-mouse IgG2a mAb. Samples were read on a BD LSR flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using fluorescence-activated cell sorter DiVa 3.1 software. Standard beads (Quantum™ 25 FITC High Level, Bangs Laboratory, Fishers, IN) were prepared for quantification of molecules of equivalent soluble fluorophore (MESF). A calibration curve was generated by plotting the MESF against the mean fluorescence intensities of each of the five bead populations. The MESF for the cells were calculated by comparing the fluorescence intensities of the cells with those of the standard beads. The site densities on the cell surface of the molecule in question were determined by dividing the MESF value by the apparent cell surface area and the fluorophore/protein ratio. Micropipette Adhesion Frequency Assay—The micropipette adhesion frequency assay has been described previously (22Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). K562 cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution without calcium and without magnesium (HBSS-) three times before the experiments and resuspended in HBSS- with or without 2 mm Mn2+ or 2 mm Mg2+ plus 2 mm of EGTA in the presence or absence of 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and 45–55% double distilled H2O to partially swell the RBCs. In some control experiments, K562 cells were washed with HBSS- with 5 mm EDTA and then with HBSS- before being assayed in HBSS- with or without 5 mm EDTA. In other control experiments, the HBSS-/EDTA-washed cells were incubated with 2 mm of Mn2+, Mg2+ (plus 2 mm EGTA), or Ca2+ and then washed with HBSS- before being assayed in HBSS-. By using two micropipettes, a K562 cell and an RBC were aspirated gently and aligned with a small axial gap between them (Fig. 2). One pipette was connected to a computer-controlled piezoelectric actuator that was programmed to move back and forth at a uniform rate of 1 μm/s. Cells were placed in contact for a prescribed duration and then retracted away from each other. Upon retraction, the unaspirated portion of the RBC was either separated freely from the K562 cell and returned to its original spherical shape, indicating no adhesion (scoring 0), or remained bound with an elongated shape, indicating adhesion (scoring 1), until final detachment by further retraction. This test cycle was repeated 100 times using the same pair of cells, keeping the contact duration (t) and the area (Ac, ∼3 μm2) constant, and averaging the adhesive scores to calculate an adhesion frequency (Pa). More than 5 pairs of cells were tested per contact time to obtain the mean ± S.E. of Pa at that t. The contact duration was varied from 0.5 to 60 s to obtain a Pa versus t binding curve. For each species of I domain or αLβ2, 2–3 curves were generated using a total of ∼100 pairs of cells by varying the site densities of I domain/αLβ2 (mr) or ICAM-1 (ml). The 2D effective binding affinity (AcKa) and off-rate (koff) were calculated by fitting Equation 1 (22Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar)Pa=1-exp{-mrmlAcKa(1-exp(-kofft))}(Eq. 1) to the binding curves by using iteratively reweighted nonlinear regression (27Williams T.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1858-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For some experiments, the adhesion frequency was determined at sufficiently long contact duration without measuring a full binding curve to simply estimate the effective binding affinity (AcKa) from Equation 2,AcKa=1mrmlln[1-Pa(∞)]-1(Eq. 2) which is derived from the steady-state version (i.e. t → ∞) of Equation 1. Measuring Specific Integrin-ICAM-1 Binding Affinity and Kinetics—Expressed on the cell surface, both isolated I domains and whole αLβ2 heterodimers mediated sufficient levels of adhesion with ICAM-1 reconstituted on RBC to be measured by the micropipette, which is capable of measuring interactions with affinities too low for many conventional adhesion assays to detect (28Williams T.E. Nagarajan S. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1867-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). By sorting the K562 cells to express appropriate levels of I domain or whole αLβ2 and reconstituting appropriate levels of ICAM-1 on RBCs, the equilibrium frequencies of adhesion of each pair of interacting molecules were adjusted to midrange levels, i.e. 0.2–0.8. To estimate reliably binding parameters, 2–3 curves were generated for each species by varying the site densities of integrin or ICAM-1 or both (Fig. 3). The detected interactions were mostly specific, as the adhesion frequency between the K562 cells and RBCs without ICAM-1 coupling was <0.06, which was deemed as nonspecific binding (Fig. 3 and data not shown). The use of Equations 1 and 2 requires that Pa be a specific adhesion frequency, which can be calculated from the total adhesion frequency (Pt) after removing the nonspecific adhesion frequency (Pn) according to Equation 3 (21Dustin M.L. Bromley S.K. Davis M.M. Zhu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Williams T.E. Nagarajan S. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. J. Biol.

Pa=(Pt-Pn)/(1-Pn)(Eq. 3) For all integrin molecules tested, measurement of specific ICAM-1 binding affinity and kinetics requires that the I domain MIDAS be occupied by a divalent cation, as binding was reduced to the nonspecific level when measured in HBSS- with EDTA (Fig. 4A). Washing the cells first with HBSS- containing EDTA and then with HBSS- to remove EDTA and resuspending them in HBSS- for adhesion test also diminished binding to the nonspecific level (Fig. 4B). Thus, after stripping the metal ion off the I domain MIDAS with EDTA, no specific adhesion frequency above the noise level could be calculated from Equation 3, thereby preventing estimates of integrin-ICAM-1 binding affinity and kinetics from Equations 1 and 2. However, washing the cells previously exposed to divalent cations with and then performing micropipette assay in HBSS- without EDTA resulted in sufficiently high specific adhesion signals above noise from Equation 3. This indicates that without using EDTA, the metal ion pre-bound to the I domain MIDAS remained bound for hours in HBSS- to enable specific integrin-ICAM-1 binding. To study further the regulation of ICAM-1 binding affinities of the different I domains and whole αLβ2 by divalent cations, we chose the base-line experimental condition to be one in which K562 cells were first allowed to bind divalent cations, washed with HBSS-, and then assayed for ICAM-1 binding in HBSS-. Inclusion of 2 mm Mn2+ or 2 mm Mg2+ in the chamber solution where micropipette adhesion assay was performed was chosen to be the activating experimental condition. Note that in both the base-line and activating conditions, it was the specific adhesion mediated by binding of ICAM-1 to the I domain MIDAS pre-bound with a divalent cation that was measured. Specific ICAM-1 binding affinities and kinetics of WT and mutant αL I domain as well as WT and mutant whole αLβ2 in these two conditions were compared in the present study to elucidate their conformational regulation. The EDTA condition was not used because it did not allow specific ICAM-1 binding affinity and kinetics to be measured by our method. The Locked Open, Intermediate, and Closed I Domains Bind ICAM-1 with High, Intermediate, and Low Affinities—Tested under the base-line condition, locking the I domain into high and intermediate conformations increased the binding affinities by ∼8,000- and ∼30-fold compared with the locked closed I domain, which was on the same order of magnitude as the affinity of the WT I domain (p > 0.06) (Fig. 5A and TABLE ONE). Therefore, the alternation of the C-terminal α7 helix position was sufficient to regulate the ligand binding affinity of the I domain when expressed on cell surface, in agreement with the 3D SPR measurement (8Shimaoka M.

Most surprisingly, differences among the off-rates for the four isolated I domains were modest at best, with the locked open I domain having the smallest off-rate of 0.41 s-1 and the locked closed I domain having the largest off-rate of 0.71 s-1 (Fig. 5B and TABLE ONE), in sharp contract to the 3D SPR measurement (8Shimaoka M.

We first hypothesized that I-BABP may negatively regulate the FXR activity by competing for the ligands, bile acids. Reporter assays using stable HEK293 cell lines expressing I-BABP revealed that I-BABP enhances rather than attenuates FXR activity. In these cells I-BABP localizes predominantly in the cytosol and partially in the nucleus, a distribution that does not shift in response to FXR expression. In vitro binding assays reveal that recombinant I-BABP is able to bind 35S-labeled FXR and that chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) stimulates this interaction modestly. When FLAG-tagged FXR was expressed in stable cells, the FXR·I-BABP complex in the nuclear extracts was more efficiently immunoprecipitable with anti-FLAG antibodies in the presence of CDCA. These results indicate that I-BABP stimulates FXR activity through a mutual interaction augmented by bile acids. When stable cells were transfected with an expression plasmid of the ileal bile acid transporter 14(IBAT) essential for the reabsorption of conjugated bile acids, the C-labeled conjugated bile acid, glycocholic acid, was more efficiently imported via IBAT in the presence than absence of I-BABP, whereas no change was observed in 14C-labeled CDCA uptake, which is independent of IBAT. Immunofluorescent staining analysis revealed that these two proteins co-localize in the vicinity of the plasma membrane in stable cells.

Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and secreted into the small intestine, where they facilitate absorption of fat and fatsoluble vitamins by solubilizing dietary lipids. Most are reabsorbed from the lower small intestine and returned to the liver. The bile acid synthesis rate in the liver is tightly regulated by the activity of a key enzyme of this pathway, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). 3The abbreviations used are: CYP7A1cholesterol 7α-hydroxylaseFXRfarnesoid X receptorRXRretinoid X receptorIBATileal bile acid transporterI-BABPileal bile acid-binding proteinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateFABPfatty acid-binding proteinCDCAchenodeoxycholic acidGCAglycocholic acidGCDCAglycochenodeoxycholic acidFBSfetal bovine serumPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorLBDligand-binding domain. Bile acids returned to the liver induce FXR activity and suppress transcription of the CYP7A1 gene by the inhibitory effect of SHP (small heterodimer partner), one of the FXR target genes, on the activity of LRH-1 (liver receptor homologue-1), which positively regulates the gene expression of this enzyme (1Lu T.T.

The primary bile acids produced in the liver are usually converted into either glycine- or taurine-conjugated bile acids prior to excretion into the bile. The active uptake of conjugated bile acids from the intestine is mediated by the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) located on the apical membrane of the ileal enterocyte (3Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of IBAT-null mice revealed that this transporter is essential for efficient intestinal absorption of bile acids and that alternative absorptive mechanisms are unable to compensate for the loss of IBAT function (4Dawson P.A.

Once bile acids are taken up in the ileacytes, the ileal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP), an abundant 14-kDa cytosolic protein, binds them. I-BABP is one of the target genes for FXR in the small intestine and therefore becomes more abundant in the presence of bile acids (5Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Indeed, both FXR and I-BABP are co-expressed along the small intestine. I-BABP is thought to be involved in facilitating the uptake of bile acids and their intracellular trafficking in the small intestine, but its exact functions remain to be specifically elucidated. I-BABP belongs to the fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family, the members of which share a remarkably similar structure along with a small molecular mass (14-15 kDa) (6Kanda T. Foucand L.

Ono T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Unlike the other family members, I-BABP is unique in that its ligands, bile acids, directly govern its genetic expression by the activity of FXR. Because these two proteins bind bile acids, we first speculated that there is feedback regulation between FXR and I-BABP. The present study was undertaken to explore this possibility. We then focused on a possible functional interaction between I-BABP and IBAT when conjugated bile acids are imported through the plasma membrane. We show herein that I-BABP is functionally associated with FXR and IBAT in the nucleus and on the membrane, respectively, and stimulates the FXR transcriptional activity and the conjugated bile acid uptake mediated by IBAT in the ileum. Materials—CDCA, GCA, and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were purchased from Sigma. Deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and urosodeoxycholic acid were from Wako (Osaka, Japan). [Carboxyl-14C]CDCA was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. and [1-14C]GCA (sodium salt) was from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were maintained in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Caco-2 cells were maintained in medium A supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% non-essential amino acids at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells cultured for 10 days after total confluency were considered differentiated. Plasmid Constructs—Expression plasmids for human FXR and human retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) were described previously (8Hirokane H. Nakahara M. Tachibana S. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol.

To generate pI-BABP900, a BglII-HindIII PCR fragment coding the 5′ promoter region (-862/+30) of the human I-BABP was inserted into a pGL3 basic vector (Promega). The mutant reporter construct, pI-BABP900mut, which contains mutations in the FXR-responsive element (5′-GGGGGCCGCCCT-3′, mutations underlined), was synthesized by a PCR-assisted method using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The expression plasmid pGal4-FXR was constructed by inserting the fragment encoding human FXR into a Gal4 DNA-binding domain expression vector, pM (Clontech). The expression plasmid of human I-BABP, pME-hIB-ABP, was constructed by inserting the fragment encoding human I-BABP into a pME18S vector (9Sato R. Inoue J. Kawabe Y. Kodama T. Takano T. Maeda M. J.

The expression vector pCMV-hIBAT and anti-human IBAT antibodies were kind gifts from Dr. Paul A. Dawson. The expression plasmids pFLAG-IBAT and pFLAG-FXR were generated by inserting the fragment for human IBAT and FXR, respectively, into p3XFLAG-CMV-7.1 (Sigma). Stable Cell Lines—HEK293 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid, either pME-hIBABP or pME18S, together with a blasticidin deaminase expression plasmid, pMAM2-BSD (Funakoshi, Japan). The cells were cultured with a selection medium containing 8 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen), and the surviving clonal cells were collected. The I-BABP level in each cell line (HEK-IBABP-1, -2, and -3) was determined by Western blot analysis. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using an RNA preparation kit (Isogen, Nippon Gene Corp.). The RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis in a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences). Probes for human I-BABP and 36B4 (8Hirokane H.

The membrane was hybridized with radioactive cDNA probes, and the signals on the membrane were quantified using an image-analyzing system (FLA-3000, FujiFilm Inc.). Western Blot Analysis—HEK293 cells stably expressing I-BABP were set up in medium A supplemented with 10% FBS on day 0. On day 2, the cells were harvested, and total cellular proteins were fractionated by SDS-15% PAGE. Western blot analysis was carried out using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human I-BABP (6Kanda T. Foucand L. Nakamura Y. Niot I. Besnard P. Fujita M. Sakai Y. Hatakeyama K. Ono T. Fujii H.

HEK293 cells (35-mm dishes) were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 0.2 μg of a reporter plasmid, 0.01 μg of phRL-TK, an expression plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase (Promega), and expression plasmids (0.1 μg each) for human FXR and human RXRα. Forty-eight hours later, both the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified using a Dual-Luciferase™ reporter system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions (12Misawa K.

In Vitro Pull-down Assays—[35S]Methionine-labeled human FXR was prepared by in vitro translation with the TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). I-BABP-Sepharose was prepared by covalently binding recombinant human I-BABP to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). IgG-Sepharose was also prepared using unrelated mouse IgG. For in vitro pull-down assays, [35S]methionine-labeled FXR was incubated with Sepharose beads for 2 h in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, protease inhibitors). To assess whether I-BABP-FXR interaction depends on ligands, the assay was carried out with or without 50 μm CDCA in buffer A. After the beads were washed several times, the proteins were eluted with an SDS-loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The signals on the membrane were quantified using an image-analyzing system (FLA-3000, FujiFilm). Immunocytochemistry for I-BABP and IBAT Localization—-HEK293 cells stably expressing I-BABP (HEK-IBABP-3) were grown on glass chamber slides and, at 80% confluency, were transiently transfected with the expression plasmid pFLAG-IBAT and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 24 h after transfection. To detect localization of I-BABP and FLAG-IBAT, cells were stained with anti-I-BABP antibodies (1:100) and anti-FLAG antibodies (1:100; M2, Sigma) followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibodies (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), respectively. Fluorescence staining was visualized using an Olympus FV500 confocal microscope. Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—The nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (14Hirano Y.

Subsequently, 50 mm glycine was added to the reaction to stop the crosslinking reaction, followed by centrifugation to remove aggregates. Supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Bioscience) for 12 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), eluted with an SDS-loading buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Bile Acids Induce I-BABP Gene Expression in Differentiated Caco-2 Cells through a Positive Bile Acid-responsive Element in Its Promoter—I-BABP is one of the target genes of FXR in the small intestine. A previous in vivo study showed a significant expression of I-BABP mRNA in the mouse ileum, where FXR gene expression was exclusively found to be elevated (5Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The present experiment demonstrates that in differentiated Caco-2 cells the expression level of I-BABP mRNA is quite low under normal culture conditions and is tremendously augmented by various bile acids, which are known as FXR ligands, but not by the bile acid urosodeoxycholic acid, a non-ligand (Fig. 1A, UDCA). To confirm the FXR-dependent induction of I-BABP gene expression, reporter assays using the human I-BABP promoter were performed. Fig. 1B shows that HEK293 cells lacking endogenous FXR require forced expression of both FXR and RXRα to a more than 10-fold induction of luciferase activity, which is specifically dependent on a positive bile acid-responsive element previously identified in the I-BABP promoter (5Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 16Zaghini I. Landrier J.-F. Grober J. Krief S. Jones S.A. Monnot M.-C. Lefrére I. Watson M.A. Collins J.L. Fujii H. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1324-1331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results clearly show that I-BABP expression is regulated exclusively by the activation of FXR via ligand binding. A previous study also demonstrated a dramatic drop in I-BABP mRNA levels in bile acid-depleted mice treated with a bile acid-binding resin, in contrast to a marked increase after chronic bile acid feeding (5Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to hypothesize the possibility of negative feedback regulation by the robust induction of I-BABP, which competes with FXR for the available ligands and inactivates the transcriptional activities of FXR. I-BABP Stimulates FXR Transcriptional Activities—To investigate the effect of I-BABP on FXR transcriptional activities, reporter assays were conducted in HEK293 cells expressing I-BABP transiently or stably. First we employed a heterologous Gal4 system using a fusion protein, including a Gal4 DNA-binding domain and full-length FXR, to analyze the functional correlation between I-BABP and FXR in transient transfection assays (Fig. 2A). In contrast to our working hypothesis, forced expression of I-BABP indeed stimulated the Gal4-FXR activities in the presence of 30 or 100 μm CDCA. When a native I-BABP promoter was used, a slight, but not significant, enhancing effect of I-BABP was observed (data not shown). To further confirm the I-BABP effect, we established three stable HEK293 cell lines (HEK-IBABP) with different levels of I-BABP and carried out reporter assays using these cell lines. Fig. 2B shows that HEK-IBABP-3 cells were the most abundantly expressed I-BABP, whereas no I-BABP was detected in parental and mock-transfected HEK293 (HEK-mock) cells. In both types of luciferase assays using the native I-BABP promoter and a heterologous Gal4 system with these stable cell lines, the FXR transcriptional activities were augmented in the presence of CDCA (30 or 100 μm), almost in an I-BABP expression level-dependent manner (Fig. 2, C and D). These results clearly indicate that I-BABP stimulates FXR activities in the presence of bile acid rather than competing for bile acid ligands to FXR. I-BABP Localizes Predominantly in the Cytosol but Also in the Nucleus in HEK-IBABP-3 Cells—To examine whether I-BABP co-localizes with FXR in the nucleus and whether CDCA affects localization, both HEK-mock and -IBABP-3 cells were transfected with pFLAG-FXR, and their intracellular localization was analyzed by Western blotting. In Fig. 3, an 0.05 volume of either the nuclear or the cytosol fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The signals were quantified with a LuminoImager, and the ratio of the nuclear form to the cytosolic form was determined. As shown in Fig. 3, I-BABP localizes predominantly in the cytosol, but also in the nucleus, in accordance with our previous finding (17Iseki S. Amano O. Kanda T. Fujii H. Ono T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 123: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the expression of FXR localizing both in the nucleus and the cytosol did not alter the distribution of I-BABP (lanes 4 and 5). Moreover, no change in the intracellular distribution of these proteins was observed with CDCA treatment. The ratios of nuclear FLAG-FXR to cytosol FLAG-FXR ranged slightly from 0.5 to 0.8 (Fig. 3, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). I-BABP Interacts with FXR, and Bile Acid Strengthens the Interaction—To reveal the molecular mechanism by which I-BABP stimulates FXR transcriptional activity, we explored the protein-protein interaction in vitro. Fig. 4A shows that resins conjugated with recombinant I-BABP, but not with unrelated IgG, trapped 35S-labeled FXR even in the absence of bile acid and more FXR in the presence of CDCA (on average 1.6-fold more in three separate experiments). To further confirm the interaction, we determined the I-BABP·FXR complex in the nucleus of HEK-IBABP-3 cells transfected with the expression plasmid pFLAG-FXR. The nuclear extracts were prepared and incubated with a cross-linker, dithio-bis(succinimidyl propionate), to strengthen the protein-protein interaction, and then FXR was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. Although CDCA did not affect the nuclear localization of these two proteins, in the presence of CDCA I-BABP was more efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with FXR (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4), consistent with the results shown in Fig. 4A. In HEK-mock cells, CDCA did not have any effect on FLAG-FXR (as shown in Fig. 3), and I-BABP was not immunoprecipitable (lane 1). These results suggest that I-BABP facilitates the FXR activities through protein-protein interaction.FIGURE 4In vitro and in vivo analyses of the interaction between FXR and I-BABP. A, [35S]methionine-labeled human FXR prepared by in vitro translation was incubated with either I-BABP- or IgG-Sepharose beads in the presence or absence of 50 μm CDCA. After the beads were washed several times, the proteins were eluted with an SDS-loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The signals on the membrane were quantified using an image-analyzing system (FLA-3000, FujiFilm). B, HEK-mock and HEK-IBABP-3 cells transfected with pFLAG-FXR were incubated with or without 100 μm CDCA for 4 h. Whole cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Nucleus fractions prepared from cells cultured in five 100-mm dishes were subjected to the cross-linking reaction using dithio-bis(succinimidyl propionate) following immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-FLAG antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-I-BABP or anti-FLAG antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Co-expression of both I-BABP and IBAT Stimulates the FXR Activity of Conjugated Bile Acids—Most bile acids are thought to be absorbed as a conjugated form from the ileum, where both IBAT and I-BABP are exclusively expressed. To see the biological relationship between I-BABP and IBAT, HEK-IBABP-3 cells transfected with an expression vector of IBAT were incubated with conjugated bile acids, and the FXR activity in these cells was examined. Although none of the glycine-conjugated bile acids enhanced the luciferase activities without the expression of IBAT (data not shown), the FXR activity was enhanced by both conjugated bile acids (GCA and GCDCA) in HEK-mock and HEK-IBABP-3 cells expressing IBAT (Fig. 5A). A greater increase in luciferase activity was observed in HEK-IBABP-3 cells than in HEK-mock cells in the presence of GCA or GCDCA. Fig. 5B shows that the IBAT expression levels in the two cell lines were almost equal with or without bile acids. We further examined whether I-BABP might stimulate the uptake of conjugated bile acids through IBAT. The uptake of 14C-labeled conjugated bile acid (GCA) was notably augmented in the presence of both I-BABP and IBAT, whereas 14C-labeled CDCA did not change in the presence or absence of I-BABP/IBAT (Fig. 6, A and B). Similar results were obtained when cells were incubated for a shorter time (4 h, data not shown). Fig. 6C shows that IBAT expression was constant in the absence or presence of I-BABP. These results suggest that the transport of conjugated bile acids mediated by IBAT through the apical membrane is facilitated by intracellular I-BABP.FIGURE 6Effects of I-BABP on the uptake of bile acids. HEK293 cells were set up on day 0 and transfected with pCMV-hIBAT and/or pME-IBABP on day1. After a 16-h incubation with radiolabeled bile acids (3 μm [14C]CDCA (A) and 3 μm [14C]GCA (B)) on day 3, the cells were harvested, and incorporated radioactivity levels were determined. The values given are the average of data from more than three experiments performed in triplicate. C, whole cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-I-BABP or anti-IBAT antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the intracellular co-localization of I-BABP and IBAT on the membrane, using HEK293 cells expressing both proteins to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the increased uptake of conjugated bile acids mediated by the combination of IBAT and I-BABP. In HEK-IBABP-3 cells, I-BABP localized mainly in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus, consistent with the result shown in Fig. 3. Transiently expressed IBAT was stained on the plasma membrane and the cytoplasmic organelles. The overlaid image shows the co-localization of these proteins in the vicinity of the plasma membrane (Fig. 7, yellow staining). No change in the co-localization image was found with conjugated or unconjugated bile acid treatment (data not shown). This co-localization might explain the functional relationship of I-BABP and IBAT in accelerating the influx of conjugated bile acids. I-BABP is a 14-kDa cytoplasmic protein that belongs to the FABP family, the members of which share a remarkably similar structure. Like other FABPs, the biological functions of I-BABP have remained only incompletely understood. On the basis of the findings that I-BABP gene expression is exclusively regulated by the function of FXR and that these two proteins are capable of binding the same ligands, bile acids, we first hypothesized negative feedback regulation of FXR activity by I-BABP via a competition for bile acids. In contrast, we provide evidence here that I-BABP is able to interact with FXR in the nucleus and stimulate its transcriptional activity. Although I-BABP enhances FXR transcriptional activity quite modestly, this positive effect is nevertheless biologically relevant considering the abundance of I-BABP in the ileum. It has been reported that other members of the FABP family are also able to interact with various nuclear receptors and augment their transcriptional activity. L-FABP interacts with PPARα and PPARγ, but not with PPARδ, in a ligand-independent manner and plays the role of a positive regulator of activity for these nuclear receptors (18Wolfrum C. Borrmann C.B. Börchers T. Spener F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2323-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that adipocyte and keratinocyte FABPs selectively enhance the activities of PPARγ and PPARδ, respectively, and that these FABPs relocate to the nucleus in response to selective ligands (19Tan N.-S. Shaw N.S. Vinckenbosch N. Liu P. Yasmin R. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Noy N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5114-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these FABPs interact directly with the PPAR subtype and enhance the transcriptional activities of these receptors. CRABP-II (cellular retinoic acid-binding protein-II) is another example of enhancement of the ligand-induced transcriptional activity of retinoic acid receptor-α (20Sessler R.J. Noy N. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Taken together, the evidence indicates these family members containing I-BABP exert their effects by interacting directly with the respective receptors, and the resulting complexes are likely to mediate the delivery of ligands to the receptors. However, we did not observe any I-BABP translocation to the nucleus in response to bile acids. It has been established that CRABP-II, adipocyte FABP, and keratinocyte FABP share the same nuclear localization signal motif in their molecules, but I-BABP does not contain this motif (20Sessler R.J. Noy N. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that different types of nuclear localization systems exist, some of which are ligand-inducible or ligand-independent, for the different FABP family members. The exact mechanism by which I-BABP enhances the FXR transcriptional activity without any increase in the translocation of these proteins to the nucleus in response to bile acids remains uncertain. There are several conceivable but still speculative possibilities in terms of I-BABP functions. The interaction between FXR and I-BABP in the nucleus may contribute to local elevation of bile acid concentration around the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of FXR, thereby facilitating the delivery of ligands to the LBD. The LBD is occupied with co-repressor proteins in the absence of bile acids, whereas binding of ligands to FXR induces a conformational change within the LBD, resulting in the release of existing co-repressor proteins and permitting the association of co-activator proteins. Thus, it is possible that I-BABP interacting with FXR may accelerate the dissociation of co-repressor proteins and/or the association of a co-activator protein, PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α), which mediates a series of events leading to transcriptional activation of the target genes (21Savkur R.S. Thomas J.S. Bramlett K.S. Gao Y. Michael L.F. Burris T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a slight chance that I-BABP makes PGC-1α extend its association with FXR is unable to be disregarded. The molecular mechanism underlying the stimulation of the FXR transcriptional activity by I-BABP is now under investigation. I-BABP has been postulated to be involved in intracellular bile acid trafficking and to facilitate the uptake of bile acid in the small intestine (22Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 23Landrier J.F. Grober J. Zaghini I. Besnard P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 239: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Indeed, the current data show that I-BABP is functionally associated with IBAT in enhancing bile acid influx efficiency when both are expressed in HEK293 cells. A previous study using a photoaffinity labeling technique revealed that I-BABP might interact with IBAT (24Kramer W. Wess G. Bewersdorf U. Corsiero D. Girbig F. Weyland C. Stengelin S. Enhsen A. Bock K. Kleine H. Ledreau M.-A. Schäfer H.-L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IBAT, which consists of ∼40 amino acids, might interact with I-BABP because the last transmembrane domain adjacent to the C-terminal tail can bind bile acids (25Kramer W. Girbig F. Glombik H. Corsiero D. Siegfried S. Weyland C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36020-36027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To obtain direct evidence for such mutual interaction, we examined whether I-BABP forms a complex with a soluble glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, including the IBAT C-terminal tail, when expressed in HEK293 cells, but failed to detect such a complex. Immunostaining analysis revealed only a co-localization of these two proteins along the membrane. These results suggest that I-BABP might be coupled functionally with IBAT without a tight protein-protein interaction. In contrast with these findings, a previous work demonstrated that daily intestinal cholate reabsorption in the FXR-/- mice was higher than in wild-type mice despite the complete absence of I-BABP protein in the ilea of the knock-out mice (26Kok T. Hulzebos C.V. Wolters H. Havinga R. Agellon L.B. Stellaard F. Shan B. Schwarz M. Kuipers F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41930-41937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), suggesting that I-BABP negatively interferes with the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Recently the heteromeric organic solute transporter (Ost)α-Ostβ was identified as a basolateral bile acid carrier thought to be responsible for bile salt efflux in ileum (27Dawson P.A. Hubbert M. Haywood J. Craddock A.L. Zerangue N. Christian W.V. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6960-6968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In the current study we examined bile acid influx only in HEK293 cells expressing both I-BABP and IBAT but did not examine bile acid efflux driven by the Ostα-Ostβ heteromeric transporter. Because the effects of FXR deficiency on the Ostα-Ostβ heteromeric transporter remain as yet undermined, it is difficult to account for the discrepancy between our results and the results observed in FXR-/- mice. It is possible that bile acid that is trapped by FXR or I-BABP might suppress transfer through enterocytes. Alternatively, another latent bile acid reabsorption pathway might be activated in the knock-out mice to compensate for the deficiency in I-BABP. In fact, it was reported that IBAT gene expression in mice is negatively regulated by FXR via SHP-dependent repression of LRH-1 activation (28Chen F. Ma L. Dawson P.A. Sinal C.J. Sehayek E. Gonzalez F.J. Breslow J. Ananthanarayanan M. Shneider B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1909-19916Google Scholar). Further studies, including the generation of I-BABP-null mice, will have to be conducted to elucidate the biological functions of I-BABP. In the ileum, I-BABP expression is induced in response to bile acid influx, and thereafter I-BABP enhances FXR activity as shown by the current study. This leads to further I-BABP expression in the ileum without any negative regulation. Reabsorbed bile acids in the ileum ultimately arrive at the liver, where they repress the catalytic activity of CYP7A1, the first and rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis, in either an FXR-dependent or -independent manner (29Kerr T.A. Saeki S. Schneider M. Schaefer K. Berdy S. Redder T. Shan B. Russell D.W. Schwarz M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 713-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 30Wang L. Lee Y-K.

This down-regulation of bile acid synthesis may turn out to be negative regulation of I-BABP gene expression in the ileum as mediated by a decreased supply of bile acids. Another form of negative feedback regulation, at least in mice, is mediated by the suppression of IBAT gene expression, which depends on FXR activation (28Chen F. Ma L. Dawson P.A. Sinal C.J. Sehayek E. Gonzalez F.J. Breslow J. Ananthanarayanan M. Shneider B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1909-19916Google Scholar). The expression of both I-BABP and IBAT genes in the ileum might be well balanced by the bile acid-mediated activation of FXR. In conclusion, we have presented findings that reveal that I-BABP interacts with FXR, which also can bind bile acids, and enhances FXR transcriptional activity. Moreover, I-BABP co-localizes with IBAT along the plasma membrane and facilitates the IBAT-mediated influx of conjugated bile acids. Through these effects I-BABP promotes the biological functions of bile acids by attenuating their detergent effects in the ileum, where all three of these proteins are exclusively expressed.

Specifically, the dysregulation of 11 β-HSD1 in particular tissues may augment intracellular active glucocorticoid concentrations. In addition, it is certainly plausible that in human obesity, although normal circulating blood cortisol levels are found, intracellular cortisol concentrations may be elevated, conceivably because an alteration in the NADPH/NADP ratio may foster 11 β-HSD1 reductase over dehydrogenase. Given the well recognized regulation by glucocorticoids of numerous homeostatic and metabolic processes of intermediary metabolism, the role of 11 β-HSD1 in obesity is under question (2Bujalska I.J.

Interestingly, in human stromal cells from the omentum, upon differentiation to mature adipocytes, the 11 β-HSD1 activity converts from a dehydrogenase to an oxo-reductase (9Bujalska I.J. Walker E.A. Hewison M. Stewart P.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 1205-1210PubMed Google Scholar). Antithetically, in disrupted cellular homogenates, the direction is reversed, where the enzyme functions preferentially as a dehydrogenase (6Agarwal A.K. Tusie-Luna M.T. Monder C. White P.C. Mol.

The grounds for this paradox are poorly understood, but obviously substrate concentrations, ionic milieu, pH, intracellular location, and membrane binding may explain the kinetic discordance between intact cells versus homogenates (where reactions are often measured under artificial Vmax conditions). All these factors notwithstanding, the most plausible determinate of the direction of 11 β-HSD1 is the mass action effect of pyridine nucleotide cofactors. To date, no studies using intact cells have attempted to correlate ongoing in situ pentose pathway flux, which is recognized as the major intracellular producer of NADPH, with the simultaneous measurement of 11 β-HSD1 activity. Furthermore, to what extent the hormonal and metabolic manipulation of adipocyte pentose pathway (PP) may impact in situ microsomal 11 β-HSD1 activity has yet to be explored.

Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). 11 β-HSD1 Activity—The oxo-reductase direction of 11 β-HSD1 in which dehydrocorticosterone (11-DHC) is converted to corticosterone (C) was measured in intact cells and microsomes. Isolated rodent fat cells (0.25 ml) were incubated in 0.1 mm glucose Krebs buffer at 37 °C (final assay volume 0.4 ml, final cell concentration 5–6 × 105 ml or with microsomes 50 μg of protein/ml). The reaction was initiated with 250–1000 nm 11-DHC (0.15 ml), incubated for 45–90 min, and terminated by freezing on dry ice. The appearance of C in the assay medium (conditioned medium) of isolated intact cells was determined by 3H radioimmune assay of corticosterone (MP Biomedicals, Irving, CA). Baseline studies examined the effect of substrate concentration (0–2 μm 11-DHC), cell number (0-5–6 × 106 fat cells/ml) and time (0–120 min) on corticosterone production to verify consistent linear rates of 11 β-HSD1 activity throughout the assay. The dehydrogenase reaction of 11 β-HSD1 (C → 11-DHC) was measured in intact cells under identical assay conditions by the disappearance of [3H] corticosterone (as above) at a final concentration of non-labeled substrate of 100 nm. Pentose Pathway Flux—The conversion of [1-14C]glucose to 14CO2 followed previously described methods for 14CO2 collection and quantification (30McCormick K.L. Hingre K. Brown J. Mick G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 31McCormick K.L. Mick G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C476-C481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mick G.J. Bonn T.

To correct PP flux for minor 14CO2 release from [1-14C]glucose generated through the glycolytic/citric acid cycle (33Larrabee M.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Katz J. Landau B.R. Bartsch G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 727-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Larrabee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15875-15879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the release of 14CO2 from [6-14C] was also determined in parallel experiments. The incubation medium was a 0.1-mm glucose Krebs buffer, pH 7.4. Metabolic reactions were started by the addition of assay mixture containing substrate ([1-14C]glucose or [6-14C]glucose). Methods for this latter assay were identical to the PP assay with the exception that [6-14C]glucose replaces [1-14C]glucose. Glucose Dehydrogenase—Isolated microsomes were tested for glucose dehydrogenase activity in the presence and absence of CHAPSO (a zwitter ionic, non-denaturing detergent) as an index for microsomal membrane integrity. To mimic our experimental conditions, microsomes were first preincubated for 90 min at 37 °C in Krebs buffer. Next, they were washed once with 0.15 m Tris-HCL, pH 8.0 and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 0.8% CHAPSO. Glucose dehydrogenase activity was then monitored over 180 min at 25 °C in this same Tris buffer with 50 mm Na2SO4 (36Romanelli A. St-Denis J.F. Vidal H. Tchu S. van de Werve G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 37Bublitz C. Steavenson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 965: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). NADPH Measurement—NADPH was measured by an ultrasensitive radioisotopic assay (38Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as a % control (no modifier), mean ± S.D. (n = 3–4). In each case, “n” refers to an individual experiment performed on 1 day with a fresh batch of cells or microsomes. Statistical differences were determined by paired t-test. Baseline Characteristics of 11 β-HSD1 Oxo-reductase Assay—The 11 β-HSD1 oxo-reductase assay was measured in both isolated rat adipocytes and liver or fat microsomes. The reaction was linear over time (0–90 min), and its apparent Km was 0.25 μm 11-DHC. The baseline rate of corticosterone formation from 11-DHC was 32.9 ± 4.8 ng of corticosterone formed/h/105 in adipocytes and 213.5 ± 62.1 ng of corticosterone/mg protein/h liver microsomes (with 1 μm glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)). Dihydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA) and Norepinephrine (NE) Inhibit Both Pentose Pathway Flux and 11 β-HSD1 Oxo-reductase Activity—Pentose pathway and 11 β-HSD1 activities were simultaneously measured in isolated adipocytes without and with 100 μm DHEA (Fig. 1, A and B) or 1 μm NE (Fig. 1, C and D). DHEA inhibited both the PP and oxo-reductase activities by 56–60% (p <0.01) over the 90-min assay interval. Similarly, the adrenergic agent, NE, attenuated adipocyte pentose pathway (Fig. 1C) and 11 β-HSD1 oxo-reductase (Fig. 1D) activities by 54–60%. Importantly, reaction rates were linear and cell counts as well as lactate dehydrogenase release (cellular integrity) were stable (>90% baseline) with or without either inhibitor. It is noteworthy that DHEA did not directly affect 11 β-HSD1 enzyme activities in ruptured or homogenized fat cells. To determine whether the inhibition of these agents directly affected hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD), which is the microsomal counterpart of cytosolic G6PD, isolated liver microsomes were incubated with and without DHEA or NE and 11 β-HSD1 oxo-reductase measured. As shown in Fig. 2, neither agent altered microsomal 11 β-HSD1 oxo-reductase. To determine whether the inhibitory actions of DHEA and NE on 11 β-HSD1 (as shown in Fig. 1, B and D) were enzyme specific, the reverse reaction (11-dihydrocorticosterone formation) was measured with and without these compounds. If these agents inhibit 11 β-HSD1 oxo-reductase by curtailing the supply of NADPH, then, conversely, they should stimulate the dehydrogenase direction. Both agents stimulated the dehydrogenase reaction by 2.5–3-fold (Fig. 3), although the effect of NE was not statistically significant.FIGURE 2Effect of DHEA and NE on liver microsomal 11 β-HSD1 oxo-reductase activity. Intact liver microsomes (50 μg of protein/ml) were preincubated for 60 min with modifiers (1 or 10 μm NE and 10 or 100 μm DHEA), and then 11 β-HSD1 oxo-reductase activity was measured over 45 min in the incubation medium as shown under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are given as a percent of control (no additions) and represent the mean ± S.D. for three separate experiments. There were no statistical differences for effect of modifier over control (no addition) by paired t-test. The control rate was 317 ± 52 ng corticosterone/h/mg protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Effect of DHEA and NE on the dehydrogenase reaction of 11 β-HSD1. Adipocytes were prepared fresh and preincubated for 45 min with 100 μm DHEA or 1 μm NE. 11 β-HSD1 dehydrogenase activity was measured as shown under “Experimental Procedures” as the disappearance of radiolabeled corticosterone over time. Results are expressed relative to control (no modifier). Statistical comparisons for the effect of either modifier on 11 β-HSD1 dehydrogenase activity are by paired t-test versus no additions (mean ± S.D., n = 3). The basal dehydrogenase rate was 0.9 ± 0.06 ng/h/105 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Metabolites of the 11 β-HSD1 Enzyme Reaction Regulate Pentose Pathway Activity in Isolated Fat Cells—If PP and 11 β-HSD1 are metabolically linked, then the substrate/products of the 11 β-HSD1 reaction might in turn affect PP flux. To examine this possibility, fat cells were preincubated with either 10 μm corticosterone or 11-DHC and then pentose pathway flux measured over 45 min. As predicted from Fig. 10, corticosterone, which would promote dehydrogenase flux (stimulates 11-DHC formation and an increased NAPDH/NADP ratio), inhibited PP by 30% whereas 11-DHC (stimulates corticosterone formation and, hence, reduces the NAPDH/NADP ratio) stimulated PP by 23% (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Regulation of pentose pathway by substrates of 11 β-HSD1 enzyme (11-DHC and corticosterone). Fat cells were preincubated with 10 μm 11-DHC or 10 μm corticosterone for 30 min, and then pentose pathway flux was measured over 90 min as shown under “Experimental Procedures”. Results are given for three experiments and expressed as mean ± S.D. relative to control (no additions). Statistical differences by paired t-test are shown. The control (no additions) rate of pentose pathway activity was 7.14 ± 9.5 nmol/h/105 adipocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) G6P Stimulates 11 β-HSD1 Oxo-reductase in Microsomes—If the microsomal membrane transports G6P, then generation of this metabolite by cytosolic PP would lead to enhanced 11 β-HSD1 activity. To test this relationship, isolated liver microsomes were incubated with increasing concentrations of G6P. G6P stimulated liver microsomal 11 β-HSD1 reductase activity (Fig. 5). However, this stimulating effect was less so in isolated adipocyte microsomal membranes with 1, 5, and 10 mm G6P inasmuch as this compound activated 11 β-HSD1 activity by 19 ± 3, 28 ± 3, and 60 ± 7% over basal (no G6P). These results were significant at p <0.025, p <0.01, and p <0.01, respectively. Microsomal Membrane Intactness Demonstrated by the Latency of Glucose Dehydrogenase Activity—The intactness of our experimental microsome preparation was tested by measuring glucose dehydrogenase activity following preincubation with and without the detergent membrane solubilizer (0.8% CHAPSO for 30 min at 4 °C). Glucose dehydrogenase is an NADP-requiring intraluminal microsomal enzyme whose activity is largely undetectable in intact microsomes (36Romanelli A. St-Denis J.F. Vidal H. Tchu S. van de Werve G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The results show that untreated microsomes were largely intact (no detectible glucose dehydrogenase activity over a 180-min incubation period) (Fig. 6). G6P Translocase Inhibitors Block Microsomal 11 β-HSD1 Activity— To determine whether microsomal 11 β-HSD1 activity was dependent on transport-dependent G6P uptake/metabolism we examined 11 β-HSD1 activity in whole microsomes with and without specific inhibitors of G6P uptake (chlorogenic acid or phlorizin). As an additional control for the specificity of G6P transport/metabolism, we tested the effect of an alternative sugar phosphate (galactose-1-phosphate). As shown using liver microsomes (Fig. 7), chlorogenic acid caused a 96% decrease in G6P-stimulated 11 β-HSD1 activity, whereas Gal-1-P was ineffective. Similarly, using isolated fat microsomes, 11 β-HSD1 activity in the presence of G6P was decreased to 52.6% ± 10.7 of basal (100%) with chlorogenic acid (p <0.05 versus basal) and to 41.0 ± 6.9% of basal with phlorizin (p <0.05 versus basal). DHEA and Norepinephrine Reduce Adipocyte NAPDH Content—If DHEA and norepinephrine regulate 11 β-HSD1 oxo-reductase indirectly by inhibiting PP, then these inhibitors should, consequently, diminish adipocyte NADPH content. Therefore, the cellular content of this pyridine nucleotide phosphate was measured after 45 min of preincubation with either 100 μm DHEA or 1 μm NE (Fig. 8). The respective results showed 28 ± 1.4 and 47 ± 15% reductions in total NADPH (p <0.05 versus control, no additions). As stated previously, both cell count and lactate dehydrogenase release were measured to assess cell integrity; neither compound had any effect. NADPH Increases Liver Microsomal 11 β-HSD1 Activity—Intact liver microsomes were preincubated with various pyridine nucleotides for 60 min and 11 β-HSD1 oxo-reductase activity measured over 45 min. NADPH caused significant (>7-fold) increase in the activity of this intraluminal enzyme, whereas NADH had a lesser activating effect (166 ± 15% of basal). On the other hand, NADP was inhibitory (74 ± 6% basal) (Fig. 9). These data, along with the evidence for membrane intactness (Fig. 6), support that the microsomal membrane is not completely impermeable to NADPH over a prolonged incubation. Numerous studies have commented on the enigmatic directionality of microsomal 11β-HSD1, seemingly dependent on the enzyme status: in intact cells oxo-reductase predominates, but when the enzyme is studied under cell-free conditions, the dehydrogenase direction prevails. Indirect evidence for the necessity of a renewable source of NADPH to sustain microsomal 11βHSD-1 reductase is manifest in patients with cortisol reductase deficiency (39Draper N. Walker E.A. Bujalska I.J. Tomlinson J.W. Chalder S.M. Arlt W. Lavery G.G. Bedendo O. Ray D.W. Laing I. Malunowicz E. White P.C. Hewison M. Mason P.J. Connell J.M. Shackleton C.H. Stewart P.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The latter results in inadequate regeneration of cortisol, subsequent overstimulation of adrenocorticotropin release, and a chronic mild androgen excess that promotes the polycystic ovarian phenotype. These patients have triallelic digenic mutations, ostensibly dosage dependent, involving not only 11β-HSD1 but also H6PD, the microsomal counterpart of cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Notably, H6PD is a bifunctional enzyme that also has 6-phosphogluconolactonase catalytic activity; hence, it contains the oxidative portion of the pentose pathway (40Clarke J.L. Mason P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Not only are these patients deficient in 11 β-HSD1 but they have a concomitant decrease in H6PD activity; therefore, impaired microsomal NADPH production nullifies any residual reductase activity. Another recent article buttresses the importance of luminal H6PD in the regulation of 11 β-HSD1. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, in which endogenous expression of theses two enzymes is normally scant, co-expression studies revealed co-localization of these two enzymes in the ER. In addition, enhanced expression of H6PD stimulated 11 β-HSD1 reductase activity (41Atanasov A.G. Nashev L.G. Schweizer R.A. Frick C. Odermatt A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In our fat cell experiments, after the targeted inhibition of G6P dehydrogenase with the non-competitive inhibitor DHEA, the resultant 56% reduction in adipocyte pentose flux (Fig. 1A) produced a significant attenuation of the oxo-reductase activity of 11 β-HSD1 (Fig. 1B)."
https://openalex.org/W1966110715,"One sorting mechanism of apical and basolateral proteins in epithelial cells is based on their solubility profiles with Triton X-100. Nevertheless, apical proteins themselves are also segregated beyond the trans-Golgi network by virtue of their association or nonassociation with cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich microdomains (Jacob, R., and Naim, H. Y. (2001) Curr. Biol. 11, 1444–1450). Therefore, extractability with Triton X-100 does not constitute an absolute criterion of protein sorting. Here, we investigate the solubility patterns of apical and basolateral proteins with other detergents and demonstrate that the mild detergent Tween 20 is adequate to discriminate between apical and basolateral proteins during early stages in their biosynthesis. Although the mannose-rich forms of the apical proteins sucrase-isomaltase, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, aminopeptidase N, and dipeptidylpeptidase IV reveal similar solubility profiles comprising soluble and nonsoluble fractions, the basolateral proteins, vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, major histocompatibility complex class I, and CD46 are entirely soluble with this detergent. The insoluble Tween 20 membranes are enriched in phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol compatible with their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and the existence of a novel class of detergent-resistant membranes. The association of the mannose-rich biosynthetic forms of the apical proteins, sucraseisomaltase, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, aminopeptidase N, and dipeptidylpeptidase IV with the Tween 20-resistant membranes suggests an early polarized sorting mechanism prior to maturation in the Golgi apparatus.

The apical and basolateral domains in polarized epithelial cells exert specialized functions by virtue of their distinct protein and lipid compositions (1Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This structural asymmetry is achieved and maintained by an active and continuous sorting process of newly synthesized components and by their regulated internalization. Current concepts have established that proteins destined for the apical or basolateral membranes are sorted in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 2The abbreviations used are: TGNtrans-Golgi networkERendoplasmic reticulumSIsucrase-isomaltaseLPHlactase-phlorizin hydrolaseDPPIVdipeptidylpeptidase IVApNaminopeptidase NMHCmajor histocompatibility complexVSVvesicular stomatitis virusDRMdetergent-resistant membraneCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidney.2The abbreviations used are: TGNtrans-Golgi networkERendoplasmic reticulumSIsucrase-isomaltaseLPHlactase-phlorizin hydrolaseDPPIVdipeptidylpeptidase IVApNaminopeptidase NMHCmajor histocompatibility complexVSVvesicular stomatitis virusDRMdetergent-resistant membraneCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidney. via selective specific signals. Initial progress in the characterization of sorting signals has been achieved with the identification of tyrosine-based cryptic short amino acid sequences, dileucine or leucine/isoleucine motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of basolaterally sorted proteins (2Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). trans-Golgi network endoplasmic reticulum sucrase-isomaltase lactase-phlorizin hydrolase dipeptidylpeptidase IV aminopeptidase N major histocompatibility complex vesicular stomatitis virus detergent-resistant membrane 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid Madin-Darby canine kidney. trans-Golgi network endoplasmic reticulum sucrase-isomaltase lactase-phlorizin hydrolase dipeptidylpeptidase IV aminopeptidase N major histocompatibility complex vesicular stomatitis virus detergent-resistant membrane 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid Madin-Darby canine kidney. Signals for apical targeting are, unlike the basolateral signals, diverse in nature, structure, and location.

The diversity of the signals is concomitant with the existence of multiple transport mechanisms that deliver the sorted proteins in distinct carriers from their site of sorting to the apical membrane. These mechanisms could be discriminated on the basis of association of the proteins with detergent-insoluble lipid microdomains, also termed rafts, in the Golgi complex (15Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar). Inclusion into rafts and subsequent apical sorting has been shown for some transmembrane proteins (10Lin S. Naim H.Y.

However, several apical transmembrane proteins are entirely soluble in nonionic detergents, clearly indicating that they are not incorporated in lipid microdomains on their way to the apical (18Lipardi C.

This applies also to many proteins that are secreted out of the apical domain to the external milieu (22Graichen R. Losch A. Appel D. Koch-Brandt C. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The existence of more than one mechanism of apical sorting that could be discriminated on the association or nonassociation of proteins with lipid rafts has been recently demonstrated for the intestinal proteins sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) (24Jacob R. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1444-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are focal assemblies of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in plasma membranes and demonstrate decreased fluidity in comparison with the lipids in the surrounding portions of the membrane (15Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar). A critical characteristic of these domains is their insolubility in detergents such as Triton X-100 at 4 °C and floating to lighter fractions on sucrose density gradients (25Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar). Raft association occurs predominantly with apical proteins that are recruited to these structures through their transmembrane domains, e.g. in the case of the influenza virus proteins hemagglutinin (10Lin S. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and neuraminidase (16Kundu A. Avalos R.T. Sanderson C.M. Nayak D.P. J.

The different physiochemical characteristics of detergents are reminiscent of different extraction profiles of membranes and their associated integral proteins. The variations in the extractability patterns and the altered degree of protein insolubility with a particular detergent are invaluable in defining various types of membrane microdomains or subdomains and the associated biosynthetic and processed forms of proteins during various stages of their life cycle. In this paper we employed several nonionic detergents to investigate the extractability of a number of apical and basolateral membrane proteins emphasizing the significance of protein-lipid associations in the sorting events in epithelial cells. We demonstrate the existence of a novel type of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) based on their solubility with Tween 20. These microdomains discriminate between apical and basolateral proteins at an early stage in the biosynthesis, prior to the Golgi apparatus, thus suggesting the presence of an early sorting mechanism. Immunochemical Reagents—SI was immunoprecipitated using a mixture of four different monoclonal antibodies (HBB 1/691, HBB 2/614, HBB 3/705, and HBB 2/219) (28Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D.

The antibodies were generous gifts of Dr. Dallas Swallow (Medical Research Council, London, UK). Monoclonal anti-human MHC class I antibody was purchased from Serotec (Oxford, UK). Anti-CD46 antibody was obtained from Immunotech (Marseilles, France). Monoclonal anti-G protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and anti-Nfs1 were generous gifts of Dr. E. Rodriguez-Boulan (Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) and Dr. R. Lill (University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany) (30Maisner A. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Schwartz-Albiez R.

Tissue Culture, Transfections, and Biosynthetic Labeling—Colon carcinoma cells, Caco-2, were cultured in high glucose medium as described previously (31Naim H.Y. Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J.

Caco-2 cells served also as a source for basolaterally located MHC class I. Another source for SI was a Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line that stably expresses SI (MDCK-SI) (4Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ApN and DPPIV were analyzed in the colon intestinal cell line HT-29 (32Zweibaum A. Hauri H.P. Sterchi E. Chantret I. Haffen K. Bamat J. Sordat B. Int. J. Cancer. 1984; 34: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) that expresses high levels of these two proteins. LPH was also isolated from the stably transfected epithelial MDCK cell line, MDCK-ML (33Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus and CD46 (or measles virus receptor) membrane cofactor protein, two markers for a basolateral protein, were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. 3The initial experiments of these two proteins in transfected MDCK and COS-1 cells revealed comparable biosynthetic and detergent solubility patterns of each individual protein in either cell line. We ultimately used transfected COS-1 cells in the following studies because of the higher expression levels of the recombinant proteins necessary in the sucrose gradient experiments. The cDNA of the G protein used was kindly provided by Dr. M. G. Roth (Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and corresponded to the Indiana strain of the virus (34Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4831-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA of CD46 was kindly provided by Dr. A. Maisner (University of Marburg) (30Maisner A. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Schwartz-Albiez R. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18853-18858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected using DEAE-Dextran (Sigma) according to Naim et al. (35Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine for different periods of time. The choice of the labeling periods depended on the transport kinetics of the individual proteins. For SI and LPH periods of 90 min and 4 h at 37 °C were chosen through out. Because MHC class I and the G protein of VSV both are more rapidly transported (36Capps G.G. Zuniga M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11634-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lodish H.F. Kong N. Snider M. Strous G.J. Nature. 1983; 304: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), a labeling period of 1 h was chosen. In pulse-chase analysis of SI, the cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min and chased for different periods of time. When used, 5 mm of deoxynojirimycin, a specific inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum glucosidase I (38Fuhrmann U. Bause E. Legler G. Ploegh H. Nature. 1984; 307: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) was present in the culture medium during preincubation of the cells in methionine-deficient medium and during the labeling intervals as described before (39Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detergent Extractability—Biosynthetically labeled Caco-2, HT-29, MDCK-ML or transfected COS-1 cells were solubilized in the cold for 2 h at 1% final concentration with either one of the detergents Triton X-100, CHAPS, Brij 96, or Tween 20 (all from Sigma) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl. The cellular extract with each detergent was centrifuged at 1.500 × g to yield a supernatant (S1) and a pellet (P1) containing debris and nuclei. The protein concentration in S1 was assessed by the method of Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) (see TABLE ONE) to determine the protein versus detergent concentration. The S1 was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°Candto yield a supernatant (S2) and a pellet (P2). The S2s of the various cellular extracts were further processed for immunoprecipitation with antibodies against the apical marker proteins SI, ApN, DPPIV, and LPH and the basolateral proteins MHC class I, G protein of VSV and CD46. The pellets (P2) containing the DRMs were dissolved by boiling in 1% SDS for 10 min to ensure disruption and solubilization of the DRMs. Thereafter 10-fold volume of buffer containing 1% of the nonionic detergent, i.e. Triton X-100, CHAPS, Brij 96, or Tween 20, was added. These extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatants were also immunoprecipitated with the corresponding antibodies. In another set of experiments, the DRMs were isolated on a 5–35% sucrose gradient as previously described (3Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here, the cells were solubilized with either Tween 20 or Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove debris and nuclei. The supernatant of this centrifugation was loaded at the bottom of the gradient and centrifuged for at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. The fractions were collected, and the protein concentrations in each fraction were assessed as described by Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) (see TABLE TWO). The fractions were treated prior to immunoprecipitation with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate to ensure solubilization of possibly existing DRMs. Thereafter, immunoprecipitation of SI, ApN, DPPIV, LPH, MHC class I, CD46, and VSV-G was performed from each individual gradient fractions. The supernatants containing the nonbound material were subjected to another round of immunoprecipitation with the same antibody to ensure a complete depletion of the antigenic material. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 6% (SI, LPH, ApN, and DPPIV) or 8% (MHC class I, G protein, and CD46) gels according to Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) followed by phosphorimaging.TABLE ONEEstimation of the protein concentrations versus detergent in the supernatantsDetergentRatioTriton X-1001003.68 ± 0.03Tween 201326.84 ± 0.12Lubrol932.83 ± 0.30Brij 96832.40 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab TABLE TWOProtein concentrations in eight fractions of 5–35% sucrose gradients were assessed according to Bradford (40Bradford M.M.

The phospholipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (42Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can.J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and analyzed for lipid classes and fatty acid patterns as described previously (43Meyer zu D.H. Sallmann H. Glockenthor U. von Engelhardt W. Busche R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In another set of experiments, the DRMs corresponding to the ER and the Golgi membranes were analyzed. Here, the cells were fractionated in sucrose density gradients for 2.5 h at a speed of 23.000 × g essentially as described (44Zierath J.R. He L. Guma A. Odegoard W.E. Klip A. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To separate the ER from the mitochondrial membranes, the sucrose density was between 5 and 25%, and for the separation of the Golgi membranes a density from 10 to 50% was used. The ER and Golgi membranes were collected and identified by protein markers corresponding to these compartments. Here, BiP was used as a marker of the ER (45Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearney J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), GM130 as a marker of the Golgi membranes (46Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The ER and Golgi membranes were collected and lysed with Tween 20 as described above. After an ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the DRMs were recovered, and the phospholipids were analyzed for lipid classes as described above. Association of Various Biosynthetic Forms of SI with Lipid Rafts—SI as well as several other apically sorted proteins, most notably glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored proteins, associate on their way to the cell surface with Triton X-100 DRMs (4Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Kaether C. Skehel P. Dotti C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); meanwhile they are widely known as rafts that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. The associative mechanism of the mature form of SI at a late biosynthetic stage in the TGN and its recruitment into these rafts is one essential criterion for apical sorting of this protein and also of several other proteins. Many proteins, on the other hand, do not associate with Triton X-100-insoluble rafts/DRMs in the TGN, implying the existence of other sorting mechanisms. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that these proteins are associated with special membrane domains comprising different lipid structural components and are entirely soluble in Triton X-100 but not by other nonionic detergents that exhibit different solubilization characteristics. This rationale could also apply to various biosynthetic forms of proteins, the precursor and the intermediate forms, which cluster into particular microdomains not detectable by Triton X-100. As a first step toward identification of novel mechanisms implicated in polarized sorting in epithelial cells, we set out to characterize novel types of DRMs and their putative association with precursor, intermediate, and mature forms of the SI protein. Based on the outcome of these investigations, other apical and basolateral membrane proteins will be also examined. For this purpose, we studied the solubilization profiles of SI with several nonionic detergents, Triton X-100, CHAPS, Brij 96, and Tween 20, in biosynthetically labeled Caco-2 cells or MDCK cells stably expressing SI (4Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A the complex glycosylated mature form of SI (SIc) was found to be associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, confirming previous data on the association of this form with cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich microdomains in the TGN (48Garcia M. Mirre C. Quaroni A. Reggio H. Le Bivic A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). An essentially similar pattern of extractability was obtained with CHAPS suggestive of similar solubilization properties of Triton X-100 and CHAPS and implying that the insoluble microdomains revealed upon solubilization with either one of these detergents are similar in their composition. The Brij 96 solubilization profile differed from those with the two previous detergents in that the mannose-rich ER-located form of SI (SIh) was more efficiently solubilized than SIc. A substantially different separation pattern was obtained with Tween 20. Tween 20 is a detergent with relatively larger polar headgroups than Triton X-100, Brij 96, and CHAPS, and its hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance value (50Egan R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4442-4447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of 16.7 is also higher than these detergents (for example, the hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance values of Triton X-100 and Brij 96 are 13.5 and 12.4, respectively). Its solubilization properties would therefore be expected to differ from the previous ones. As shown in TABLE ONE, quantitative differences are revealed in the protein/detergent ratios following lysis with different detergents. TABLE TWO depicts the protein content in the gradient fractions of Tween 20- and Triton X-100-extracted cells. It was higher in the upper fractions and lower in the final three fractions of the Triton X-100 gradient as compared with their counterparts in the Tween 20 gradient. In addition to these quantitative differences, qualitative differences were observed between the Tween 20 and Triton X-100 pellets. In fact, the Tween 20-insoluble pellet contained the ER-located mannose-rich glycosylated SIh as well as the complex glycosylated mature SIc and differed in this respect quantitatively from the insoluble pellets obtained with Triton X-100, Brij 96, and CHAPS, which contained predominantly the mature SIc species (Fig. 1A). The solubilization profiles of SI with all four detergents in Caco-2 cells were confirmed in another polarized cell line, MDCK stably expressing SI (Fig. 1A, lower panels). An important finding in these studies therefore is that the Tween 20-insoluble extracts/DRMs contain almost half the total amounts of the early biosynthetic form of SI, the mannose-rich SIh species, and therefore substantially more than found in the pellets of other detergents. The discrimination by Tween 20 of this early biosynthetic form suggests the presence of early insoluble membrane domains containing mannose-rich SIh. We therefore set out to investigate the kinetics of this putative association. Kinetics of Association of Early Biosynthetic Forms of SI with Tween 20-insoluble Lipid Microdomains—The association of SI with Tween 20-insoluble membranes was further analyzed in a kinetic study. As a control, the other two detergents, Triton X-100, and Brij 96 were utilized (CHAPS revealed basically similar results to Triton X-100). Caco-2 cells were pulsed for 30 min with [35S]methionine and chased for different time intervals. After 3 h of chase, cell lysis with Triton X-100 and Brij 96 results in the appearance of complex glycosylated mature SIc molecules in the detergent-insoluble pellet (Fig. 1B). The insoluble proportion of SIc increased further at 4 h of chase compatible with"

Acute hepatic failure induced by hepatic toxins such as Fas ligand (FasL), or the agonistic Fas antibody (Jo-2) is characterized by uncontrolled apoptosis of hepatocytes mediated by the death receptor Fas (FasR) (24Ogasawara J.

Moreover, the Fas receptor is present on the plasma membrane of normal hepatocytes and is overexpressed in some chronic hepatic diseases such as that induced by the hepatitis B (25Mochizuki K.

Hepatology. 1994; 19: 1354-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Binding of FasL to its cognate receptor causes hepatic apoptosis via caspase activation. This occurs through FasR-mediated assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (27Barnhart B.C. Alappat E.C. Peter M.E. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The DISC complex consists of the Fas receptor, caspase-8, caspase-10, and FADD. Autoproteolytic cleavage of caspase-8 is an early detectable event in Fas-induced apoptosis, leading to caspase-3 activation either in a mitochondria-independent manner or via a mitochondria-dependent pathway that proceeds via Bid and caspase-9 (28Scaffidi C.

Pathol. 1993; 143: 1606-1620PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PTP1B plays a role in regulating signals involved in liver damage and survival, we determined the sensitivity of PTP1B-null and wild type (WT) mouse hepatocytes to FasR activation, using two complementary experimental systems: whole liver in vivo and in vitro primary cultures. Protection from cell death and fulminant hepatic failure was evident by reduced blood levels of liver enzymes as well as reduced apoptosis in liver sections of PTP1B-null versus wild type mice after injection with agonistic Fas antibody (Jo-2). This identifies a previously unknown function for PTP1B in modulating hepatic apoptosis in response to Fas-induced liver damage. WT and PTP1B-null mice are hybrids of 129S/v and BALB/c backgrounds (12Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Female mice (4–6 weeks) were used for experiments. The antibodies were obtained as follows: monoclonal anti-Jo-2, anti-c-Raf, anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), and polyclonal anti-EGFR (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA); polyclonal anti-FLIP (Axxora LLC, San Diego, CA), polyclonal anti-PTP1B antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); mouse monoclonal anti-Met, polyclonal anti-Fas, anti-IκBα, anti-insulin receptor, and anti-IGF1 receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); polyclonal anti-caspase-9 and anti-caspase-8 (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada); polyclonal anti-caspase-3, anti-caspase-6, anti-ERK1/2 antibody, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 pTpY202/204 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Raf pYpY340/341 antibody and polyclonal pIR/IGF1RpYpYpY1158/1162/1163 (Biosource, Camarillo, CA). Wild type and PTP1B-null mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.3 μg/g body weight of Jo-2 in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. After 6 h, the mice were sacrificed, and the liver tissue was recovered by dissection. The livers were fixed by immersion in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. 4-μm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All of the mouse manipulations were carried out in accordance with McGill University animal care guidelines. Wild type and PTP1B-null mice were injected intraperitoneally as above. After 4 or 6 h, the mice were anesthetized and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture, and serum was collected. The liver damage was quantitated by measuring serum ALT and serum AST levels using ALT IFCC and AST IFCC modified reagent without pyridoxal phosphate (Roche Applied Science). The data were acquired using a Hitachi 911 analyzer. Livers were homogenized using a Mixer Mill MM301 (Glen Mills Inc., Clifton, NJ) in 1% Triton lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4). The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm to remove debris. The protein extracts were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond; Amersham Biosciences), and probed with antibodies as described, followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. All of the immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The hepatocytes were isolated according to a modified version of the two-step collagenase method originally developed for rats (30Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar, 31Deschenes J. Valet J.P. Marceau N. In Vitro. 1980; 16: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The mouse livers were perfused with a 25 mm Ca2+-free HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing insulin (0.5 μg/ml) and EGTA (0.5 mm), followed by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 modified medium containing collagenase (0.2 Wünsch units/ml) and Ca2+ (5 mmol/liter). 0.5 × 106 cells/cm2 viable hepatocytes were plated on attachment media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium with selenious acid (5 μg/liter), insulin (5 mg/liter), transferrin (5 mg/liter), and gentamycin (50 μg/ml)) on fibronectin-coated dishes. Post-attachment, dexamethasone (10–7 m) and EGF (20 ng/ml) were added to the culture medium. For cell surface Fas receptor staining, hepatocyte cell suspensions were incubated with mouse Fc block (CD16/CD32) (BD Biosciences) and Fas-specific anti-phycoerythrin antibody (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). CD62L hamster IgG2λ (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) conjugated to phycoerythrin was used as an isotype control. The data were acquired using a FACS Scan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and analyzed with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Thymuses were removed aseptically from WT and PTP1B-null mice, and single cell suspensions were prepared by gently teasing through a 70-μm nylon mesh. Thymocytes (0.15 × 106 cells/well) were cultured in 96-well flat-bottomed plates in complete RPMI medium (with glutamine, β-mercaptoethanol, and gentamycin) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and treated with Jo-2 (0.0625–1 μg/ml) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a final volume of 100 μl for 6 h. Cell viability was measured using the colorimetric WST-1 assay (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer's instructions. TUNEL Assays—The livers were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, paraffin-embedded, sectioned (4 μm), stained to visualize apoptosis using the Apoptag fluorescein in situ apoptosis detection kit (Serologicals Corporation, Norcross, GA). Tissue sections were stained with anti-digoxigenin fluorescein conjugate antibody and counterstained with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (0.5 mg/ml). Annexin V Analysis—The hepatocytes were plated at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/cm2 on fibronectin-coated dishes and preincubated with HGF (20 ng/ml) for 6 h and/or UO126 (20 μm) (BD Transduction Laboratories, Mississauga, Canada), NF-κB inhibitor peptide (SN50) (50 μg/ml) and inactive control peptide (SN50M) (50 μg/ml) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), Genistein (50 μm) (Sigma-Aldrich), or PHA-665752 (0.1 μm) (Pfizer Pharmaceuticals) for 1 h prior to treatment with Jo-2 antibody (0.5 μg/ml), FasL (10 ng/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich), or TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 4 h. TNF-α treatment was carried out in the absence or presence of actinomycin D (10 μg/ml). Annexin V staining (Roche Applied Science) was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Annexin V-positive cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis observed in untreated hepatocytes was taken as base line and subtracted from the treatment group. PTP1B-null Mice Are Protected against Fas-induced Liver Failure— Multiple cytokine and growth factor signals that play important roles as anti-apoptotic and growth-promoting signals in response to surgical or chemical liver damage (18Borowiak M.

We therefore investigated the role of PTP1B in protection against liver damage. To induce acute liver failure, PTP1B-null and WT mice were intraperitoneally injected with a lethal dose of the FasR-specific antibody Jo-2 (0.3 μg/g of body weight). The majority of PTP1B-null mice showed no overt signs of clinical compromise, loss of appetite, or decreased activity after injection with Jo-2 and were resistant to the lethal effect of the Fas-specific antibody (75%) (Table 1). In contrast, 84% of their WT counterparts presented with signs of clinical compromise, including tachypnea, shallow breathing, and prostration indicative of liver failure and were sacrificed (Table 1). The livers from these WT mice turned dark red in color following injection of Jo-2, which is indicative of liver hemorrhage, whereas livers from PTP1B-null mice did not show this phenotype (Fig. 1A). Histological analysis of livers from the Jo-2-injected WT mice that showed distress revealed parenchymal necrosis, hemorrhage, and hepatocyte apoptosis, whereas livers from the majority of PTP1B-null mice showed no significant histologic pathological features (Fig. 1B). As a measure of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptotic cells, was quantified by the incorporation of anti-digoxigenin-fluorescein in liver sections (TUNEL staining). Liver sections from Jo-2-injected WT mice showed a significant number of positive TUNEL staining cells. In contrast, few positive-staining apoptotic cells were observed in sections from either saline-injected controls or PTP1B-null mice injected with Jo-2 (Fig. 1, C and D). However, livers from the PTP1B-null mice that showed distress in response to Jo-2 (25%) (Table 1) showed parenchymal necrosis and hepatocyte apoptosis to similar levels as WT animals (supplemental Fig. S1). Blood samples were collected from WT and PTP1B-null mice at different time points (4 and 6 h) following Jo-2 injection and assayed for levels of two circulating liver enzymes, ALT and AST, elevated levels of which are indicative of liver damage. Levels of ALT and AST were significantly elevated in WT mice 6 h post-Jo-2 treatment (Fig. 1E). In contrast, ALT and AST levels were near base line in PTP1B-null mice in response to Jo-2 6 h post-injection (Fig. 1E) and remained at these levels even when assessed at 24 h (data not shown). Taken together, our data demonstrate that PTP1B-null mice are resistant to Fas-mediated liver damage.TABLE 1PTP1B deficiency prevents lethal effect of Fas-specific antibodiesFas-specific antibody injectionAliveSacrificedaThe mice were sacrificed within 6 h upon showing signs of distress.PTP1B-WT7/43 (16%)36/43 (84%)PTP1B-KO24/32 (75%)8/32 (25%)a The mice were sacrificed within 6 h upon showing signs of distress. Open table in a new tab Absence of Caspase Cleavage in Livers from Fas-treated PTP1B-null Mice—The current model of Fas engagement suggests that the Fas receptor, upon binding of FasL, recruits FADD, followed by caspase-8. Formation of this DISC complex activates caspase-8, thus initiating the caspase cascade leading to the activation of downstream caspase-9, caspase-7, caspase-6, and caspase-3 (27Barnhart B.C. Alappat E.C. Peter M.E. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). To determine the step in the apoptotic signaling cascade that is blocked because of a loss of PTP1B, we studied the presence of activated caspases in liver lysates from WT and PTP1B-null mice post-Jo-2 treatment. Consistent with our histological data (Fig. 1, B–D), cleavage of caspases-8, -9, -3, and -6, normally activated following FasR oligomerization (32Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), was detected in liver extracts from WT mice 6 h post-Jo-2 treatment but was significantly abrogated in PTP1B-null mice (Fig. 2A), even though FasR levels on the hepatocyte cell surface are similar in WT and PTP1B-null mice (Fig. 2). Because activation of caspase-8 is one of the first events following activation of the Fas receptor (32Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), our data demonstrate that one of the earliest events in Fas-induced apoptosis is abrogated in PTP1B-null mice. Induction of Signals in Livers from Fas-treated PTP1B-null Mice—In liver development and T cells, resistance to apoptosis induced by death receptors is tightly regulated by genes activated by the transcription factor NF-κB (33Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 34Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). An investigation of proteins involved in the NF-κB pathway in liver extracts revealed that levels of IκBα, the inhibitor of NF-κB signaling, were decreased in both Jo-2-treated PTP1B as well as WT mice (Fig. 3). However, the decrease in IκBα levels was significantly greater in PTP1B-null mice when compared with WT (Fig. 3), indicating greater activation of this pathway in PTP1B-null mice. Consistent with this, levels of FLIPL, a downstream transcriptional target of NF-κB (37Micheau O. Lens S. Gaide O. Alevizopoulos K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5299-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 38Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Scheurich P. Wajant H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) that can act as an inhibitor of caspase-8 activation by interacting with FADD and caspase-8 in the DISC complex (39Schneider P. Tschopp J. Pharm. Acta Helv. 2000; 74: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), were elevated in PTP1B-null mice following Jo-2 treatment when compared with WT mice (Fig. 3). In addition, MAPK enzymes (ERK1/2), which have been shown to promote survival in response to Fas (40Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 41Gilbert S. Loranger A. Marceau N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7072-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), were activated in PTP1B-null mice in response to Jo-2 but not in their WT counterparts, as assayed using anti-phospho-ERK antibodies (Fig. 3). An upstream activator of ERK1/2, Raf kinase, was also activated, as determined using a phosphospecific antiserum, in Jo-2-treated PTP1B-null mice (Fig. 3). Hepatocytes from PTP1B-null Mice Are Protected against FasL and TNF-α-induced Damage, but Thymocytes Are Not Resistant to Fas-induced Apoptosis—To establish whether protection from apoptosis is cell autonomous, the sensitivity of primary hepatocytes isolated from PTP1B-null and WT mice to both Jo-2 and the physiological FasL was assessed quantitatively by counting apoptotic cells after staining for Annexin V, an early indicator of apoptosis. In support of our in vivo data, primary hepatocytes prepared from PTP1B-null mice were more resistant to Jo-2- or FasL-induced apoptosis, when compared with hepatocytes prepared from WT mice. The number of apoptotic hepatocytes from WT mice was 25 and 30% in response to Jo-2 and FasL, respectively, whereas PTP1B-null hepatocytes did not show an increase in apoptosis in response to these treatments (Fig. 4, A and B). In agreement with results obtained by Musallam et al. (71Musallam L. Ethier C. Haddad P.S. Bilodeau M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1360-G1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), hepatocytes from WT BALB/c mice are sensitive to Jo-2 in the absence of actinomycin D. To test whether the resistance of hepatocytes from PTP1B-null mice was specific to Fas-induced apoptosis, hepatocytes from these mice were treated with TNF-α in the presence and absence of actinomycin D. As previously shown (42Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1778-1788PubMed Google Scholar), hepatocytes from WT animals are sensitive to TNF-α-induced apoptosis in the presence of actinomycin D (Fig. 4A).

Here, we show that Siah1 is a binding partner for POSH (plenty of SH3s), a scaffold component of the apoptotic JNK pathway, and that Siah contributes to death of neurons and other cell types by activating the JNK pathway. Such proapoptotic activity requires the E3 ligase activity of Siah1. Moreover, apoptotic stimuli markedly elevate cellular Siah1 levels by a mechanism reliant on Siah1 protein stabilization. This stabilization requires JNK pathway activation and interaction with POSH and is enhanced by phosphorylation of SIAH1 at tyrosines 100 and 126. Depletion of intracellular Siah proteins via small interference RNA partially protects cells from death evoked by apoptotic stimuli such as trophic factor deprivation and DNA damage. These findings thus reveal a “loop” mechanism in which the JNK pathway promotes SIAH1 stabilization and in which SIAH1 in turn activates the JNK pathway and, ultimately, contributes to cell death.

Tuynder M. Nemani M. Pasturaud P. Gendron M.C. Dausset J. Oren M. Amson R.B. Telerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8070-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In another study, however, Siah1a overexpression alone was insufficient to induce death and did so only when co-expressed with another p53-regulated gene, Pw1/Peg3 (13Relaix F. Wei X. Li W. Pan J.

Thus, the extent to which Siah1 participates in cell death and the mechanism by which it may do so remain to be more clearly defined. The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) play key roles in responses to cellular stress and in many paradigms of mammalian apoptotic cell death and therefore have the potential to be involved in Siah-associated apoptosis (20Davis R.J.

Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Recent studies implicate the multidomain molecule POSH (plenty of SH3s) as an additional element in the apoptotic JNK pathway (27Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 28Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). POSH was shown to interact directly with the GTP-bound, but not GDP-bound, form of Rac1 (27Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition to a novel Rac1 binding region, POSH contains four SH3 domains and a zinc Ring finger domain (27Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Expression of POSH in fibroblasts induces apoptosis (27Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We further established that POSH expression stimulates the JNK pathway and induces death of neuronal and other cell types and that it participates as a required element in death of neurons evoked by withdrawal of trophic support (28Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Experiments used dominant negative MLKs and an inhibitor of MLK activity placed POSH upstream of MLKs in apoptotic signaling. POSH directly binds MLK family members and interacts with downstream pathway components, including MKK4 and -7 and JNKs (28Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, POSH serves as a scaffold that links activated Rac1 with components of the JNK pathway and thus forms a complex to mediate apoptotic JNK activation and c-Jun phosphorylation (28Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The scaffold-like properties of POSH raised the possibility that it might interact with additional proteins that might also influence the JNK pathway and cell death. The present work addresses the issues of how apoptotic stimuli lead to elevation of cellular Siah levels and how this in turn leads to cell death. We show that Siah1 binds to POSH and participates in activation of the apoptotic JNK pathway. Moreover, we provide evidence for a loop in which apoptotic stimuli lead to stabilization of Siah1 protein via a mechanism dependent on JNK pathway activation and on Siah tyrosine phosphorylation, thereby enhancing its capacity to contribute to JNK-mediated death. Finally, we show that endogenous Siah plays a role in several cell death paradigms. Chemicals and Antibodies—CEP-1347 was kindly provided by Cephalon Inc. (West Chester, PA) and applied as described previously (24Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Hoechst dye 33342, camptothecin, anti-human recombinant NGF, and anti-FLAG monoclonal antisera were from Sigma. Other primary immunological reagents were directed against JNK and phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), His tag (Novagen, Madison, MI), HA tag (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), Myc tag, and GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The two-hybrid screen was performed with the ProQuest™ two-hybrid system, Invitrogen. Mouse POSH was cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the vector pDBLeu to create pDBLeu-POSH. MaV203 yeast cells were successively transformed with pDBLeu-POSH and mouse brain library pPC86 (Invitrogen). Clones were selected for strong interactions based on screening for expression of reporter genes His, LacZ, and URA3. Plasmids—The following constructs were generously provided as follows: pRK5.myc-POSH from mouse and human RAC1 and CDC42 were from Alan Hall (University College London, United Kingdom), pCDNA3.FLAG-SIAH1, pCDNA3.HA-SIAH1, and pCDNA3.FLAG-SIAH1 S41/S44 were from Eric R. Fearon (University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI), and FLAG-MLK3 cDNA was from Kathleen A. Gallo (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI), dominant negative c-jun (d/n c-jun or Tam67 c-jun) was from Michael J. Birrer (National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD). The cDNAs for both wild-type and kinase-inactive forms of MKK4 and MKK7 in pCDNA3 and MLK1, MLK2, MLK3, DLK, and their kinase-inactive forms in pCDNA3 and pCMS-EGFP have been described previously (Xu et al. (24Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar)), as have all POSH constructs in pCMS-EGFP and pGEX2T (Xu et al. (28Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)). pCMS-EGFP.FLAG-SIAH1, pCMS-EGFP.HA-SIAH1, and pCMS-EGFP.FLAG-SIAH1 S41/S44 were constructed by PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNAs in pCDNA3 (5Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), respectively. Primers used were the T7 promoter (bases 864–882) and the Sp6 promoter (bases 999–1016) in pCDNA3. The constructs were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), excised with EcoRI, and cloned into pCMS-EGFP vector. pEGFP.SIAH1 and pEGFP.SIAH1 S41/S44 were constructed by PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNAs in pCDNA3 with primers 5′-aagcttaaccatgagccgccagactgctacagca-3′ and 5′-gaattcgacacatggaaatagttacattgat-3′, cloning into pCR2.1.TOPO, and then cutting with EcoRI/HindIII and cloning into the same site of pEGFP-N1. pEGFP.POSH was constructed by PCR amplification of POSH from pCMS-EGFP.myc-POSH (Xu et al. (28Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)) with primers 5′-ccgctcgaggccaccatggatgagtctgccttgttggac-3′ and 5′-gattggatccatgttttccacaaagctccctgg-3′, cloning into pCR2.1.TOPO and then cutting with XhoI/BamHI and cloning into the same site of pEGFP-N1. The POSH fragment was excised from pEGFP-POSH with NheI/BamHI and cloned into the same site of pDSRed1-N1 to construct pRed-POSH. SIAH1 ΔC2 was constructed as a C-terminal deletion mutant of SIAH1 lacking the last 52 amino acids, which is deficient in its ability to dimerize as described previously (5Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). HA epitope-tagged SIAH1 in pCDNA3 was used as a template for PCR utilizing a T7 primer and a 3′ primer: GAGCTAAATGGTCATTGA. PCR amplicons were cloned directly into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and subcloned into EcoRI site of pCMV.EGFP. SIAH Tyrosine Mutants—Tyrosine mutants of SIAH1 were constructed by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Each of the five tyrosine residues in SIAH1, either alone or in combination for the second and third residues, was mutated so that the appropriate codon would be translated as phenylalanine instead of tyrosine. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The following primers were used (as well was the reverse complement, Y47–Y223 refer to tyrosine mutations in sequential order within the SIAH1 protein: Y47, CCAGTCTGCTTTGACTTTGTGTTACCGCCCATTC; Y100, GTACTTTTCCCCTGTAAATTTGCGTCTTCTGGATGTG; Y126, GTGAGTTTAGGCCTTTTTCCTGTCCGTGCCC; Y199, CTTAGAGAAACAGGAAAAATTCGATGGTCACCAGCAGTTC; and Y223, CAAGCTGAAAATTTTGCTTTCCGACTTGAGCTAAATGGTC. pSuppressor.siSiah1 Was Designed and Constructed by Annealing Oligonucleotides—5′tcgaggatccattcgcaacttggctattcaagagatagccaagttgcgaatggatcttttt-3′ and 5′-ctagaaaaagatccattcgcaacttggctatctcttgaatagccaagttgcgaatggatcc-3′, cutting with XhoI/XbaI, and cloning into the Sal-I/XbaI site of pSuppressor (Imgenex Co., San Diego, CA).

Underlined sequences are shared by Siah1a, Siah1b, Siah2, SIAH1, and SIAH2 (all siah family genes). Cell Culture, Transfections, and Assessment of Cell Survival—Culture and transfection of PC12 and primary rat sympathetic neurons was as described previously, as was NGF deprivation (24Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 28Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured on collagen-coated plates in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Exposure to NGF (50 ng/ml recombinant hNGF kindly provided by Genentech, Inc.) was in medium containing 1% horse serum. 293, U2OS, and MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Strip counting and counting of apoptotic nuclei were performed as previously described (24Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation, Western Immunoblotting, and in Vitro Binding Assays—Co-immunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting and in vitro binding assays were performed as previously described (24Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 28Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). pCMS-EGFP.FLAG-SIAH1 was used for in vitro transcription and translation using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). SIAH1 Binds POSH in Vivo and in Vitro—To identify POSH-interacting proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. Full-length POSH was cloned into a bait vector, and a total of ∼2 × 106 independent transformants from a mouse brain library were analyzed. Fifty-two strong to very strong positive clones were observed, and their identities were established by sequencing. Fourteen clones corresponded to Siah1a, two to Siah1b, and three to Siah2. Because Siah1 genes are well studied and were the most highly represented in our screen, further studies concentrated on rodent Siah1a and -1b and on human SIAH1 (the human and rodent forms are 97–99% identical to one another). We next used co-immunoprecipitation to confirm that SIAH1 and POSH interact in mammalian cells. 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding myc epitope-tagged POSH and FLAG epitope-tagged SIAH1, either alone or in combination. Analysis of anti-FLAG and anti-myc immunoprecipitates derived from these cells revealed that SIAH1 immunocomplexes specifically contained POSH (Fig. 1A) and vice versa (Fig. 1B). SIAH1 contains a zinc Ring finger domain associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (5Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To determine whether this ligase activity is required for interaction with POSH, a tagged enzymatically inactive mutant (SIAH1 S41/S44) was co-expressed with tagged POSH. Interaction with POSH was not impaired by this mutation (Fig. 1, A and B). Analysis of both the immunoprecipitates and cell lysates further showed that, despite comparable efficiencies of transfection (indicated by levels of co-expressed eGFP), mutant SIAH1 was much more highly expressed than the wt form (Fig. 1, A and B). This is consistent with past evidence that cellular levels of endogenous SIAH1 are very low and that this is due to automediated degradation via the proteasomal pathway (5Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). POSH also possesses a zinc Ring finger domain and putative E3 ligase activity and is more stable when this domain is deleted or mutated (28Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that a tagged POSH zinc Ring finger deletion mutant (myc-ΔRing POSH) associates with both wt SIAH1 and SIAH1 S41/S44 (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, the zinc Ring finger/E3 ligase activities of SIAH1 and POSH are not essential for their mutual interaction. The C-terminal 52 amino acids of SIAH1 are required for dimerization and auto-destabilization (5Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 29Polekhina G. House C.M. Traficante N. Mackay J.P. Relaix F. Sassoon D.A. Parker M.W. Bowtell D.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We found that, despite its greatly enhanced stability and consequent elevated expression, SIAH1 with these residues deleted (SIAH1 ΔC2) was severely compromised for interaction with POSH (Fig. 1C). Thus, SIAH1 either has to bind to POSH via its C terminus or has to form dimers for this interaction to occur. To further characterize the POSH-SIAH1 interaction, we tested the ability of GST-POSH fusion proteins to pull down SIAH1 prepared in an in vitro transcription-translation system. SIAH1 binds GST-POSH (amino acid 437–892) fusion protein but not GST alone or GST-POSH (amino acid 2–460) (Fig. 1D). These observations indicate that SIAH1 binds to the C-terminal half of POSH and that this binding is likely to be direct. Finally, to evaluate whether endogenous POSH and Siah1 interact, lysates of camptothecin-treated PC12 cells were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting with POSH and Siah1 antisera. Camptothecin treatment was used because apoptotic stimuli significantly elevate cellular levels of both POSH (40Xu Z. Kukekov Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9949-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Siah1 (see Fig. 4A). Analysis of the immunoprecipitates revealed clear interaction of the endogenous proteins (Fig. 1E). SIAH1 Induces Apoptosis—Siah1a overexpression triggers apoptosis of U937 cells (14Roperch J.P. Lethrone F. Prieur S. Piouffre L. Israeli D. Tuynder M. Nemani M. Pasturaud P. Gendron M.C. Dausset J. Oren M. Amson R.B. Telerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8070-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and cooperates with Pw1/Peg3 to promote death of L10 cells (13Relaix F. Wei X. Li W. Pan J. Lin Y. Bowtell D.D. Sassoon D.A. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We observed that transient SIAH1 overexpression also triggers death of 293T, COS-7, and U2OS cells (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Because Siah is at high levels in the developing nervous system (2Della N.G. Senior P.V. Bowtell D.D. Development. 1993; 117: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wheeler T.C. Chin L.S. Li Y.

Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we additionally evaluated the effect of SIAH1 on naïve and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells and cultured sympathetic neurons. SIAH1 overexpression reduced survival of neuronal PC12 cells and increased the proportion of transfected cells with apoptotic nuclei by about 3-fold (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar findings were achieved with naïve PC12 cells (data not shown) and with sympathetic neurons (Fig. 2D). SIAH1-induced cell death was characterized by cell contraction, surface blebbing, and broken, shrunken, and condensed (pyknotic) nuclei, all typical of cells undergoing apoptosis after transfection with MLKs (24Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) or POSH (28Xu Z. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or after withdrawal of trophic support. To determine whether the E3 ligase activity of SIAH1 is required for induction of cell death, we transfected 293 cells with the Ring finger mutant SIAH1 S41/S44 and SIAH1 ΔC2, a mutant that does not bind and lead to degradation of its targets, including itself (5Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 29Polekhina G. House C.M. Traficante N. Mackay J.P. Relaix F. Sassoon D.A. Parker M.W. Bowtell D.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although the mutant SIAH1 S41S44 and SIAH1 ΔC2 proteins are much more stable than the wt protein (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1), unlike the wt protein, they did not cause changes in cell morphology or death (data not shown). Thus, SIAH1 appears to require E3 ligase activity as well as dimerization and/or POSH interaction to induce death. SIAH1 Activates the JNK Pathway and Acts Upstream of c-Jun to Induce Death—Because SIAH1 evokes death and interacts with POSH, we postulated that SIAH1 acts in the same apoptotic pathway as POSH. To test this hypothesis, we transfected SIAH1 and the Ring finger mutant of SIAH1 (SIAH1 S41/S44) into 293 cells and found that SIAH1, but not SIAH1 S41/S44 induces JNK phosphorylation, an indicator of JNK activation, to a similar extent as that achieved by transfection with POSH (Fig. 3A). JNK phosphorylation induced by SIAH1 was blocked by CEP-1347, a drug that specifically targets MLK family members (30Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Connors T.J. Durkin J.T. Angeles T. Gessner G. Xu Z.

CEP-1347 also protected neuronally differentiated PC12 cells from death evoked by transfection with SIAH1 alone, or in combination with POSH (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2052842467,"Valosin-containing protein (p97/VCP) has been proposed as playing crucial roles in a variety of physiological and pathological processes such as cancer and neurodegeneration. We previously showed that VCP(K524A), an ATPase activity-negative VCP mutant, induced vacuolization, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, and cell death, phenotypes commonly observed in neurodegenerative disorders. However, any regulatory mechanism of its ATPase activity has not yet been clarified. Here, we show that oxidative stress readily inactivates VCP ATPase activity. With liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, we found that at least three cysteine residues were modified by oxidative stress. Of them, the 522nd cysteine (Cys-522) was identified as the site responsible for the oxidative inactivation of VCP. VCP(C522T), a single-amino acid substitution mutant from cysteine to threonine, conferred almost complete resistance to the oxidative inactivation. In response to oxidative stress, VCP strengthened the interaction with Npl4 and Ufd1, both of which are essential in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. Cys-522 is located in the second ATP binding motif and is highly conserved in multicellular but not unicellular organisms. Cdc48p (yeast VCP) has threonine in the corresponding amino acid, and it showed resistance to the oxidative inactivation in vitro. Furthermore, a yeast mutant (Δcdc48 + cdc48[T532C]) was shown to be susceptible to oxidants-induced growth inhibition and cell death. These results clearly demonstrate that VCP ATPase activity is regulated by the oxidative modification of the Cys-522 residue. This regulatory mechanism may play a key role in the conversion of oxidative stress to endoplasmic reticulum stress response in multicellular organisms and also in the pathological process of various neurodegenerative disorders.

Various human neurodegenerative disorders, such as polyglutamine diseases, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, have distinct clinical symptoms, but they share several pathological features such as accumulation of abnormal proteins or deposits of ubiquitinated proteins, formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles, and neuronal cell degeneration/death if not observed together in all disorders (1Kakizuka A.

VCP, a member of the AAA family proteins, is one of the most abundant intracellular proteins, with a molecular mass of 97 kDa and consists of the N-terminal (N) domain and two ATPase domains (D1 and D2) (11Zhang X.

Immunohistochemical examinations demonstrated that VCP co-localized with abnormal protein aggregates or ubiquitin-positive inclusions observed in several human neurodegenerative disorders, such as nuclear inclusions in Huntington disease (9Hirabayashi M.

Concomitantly, by genetic screening using our Drosophila models of the human polyglutamine disease, we identified ter94, Drosophila VCP, as a modifier of eye degeneration phenotypes induced by expanded polyglutamines (19Higashiyama H. Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Inoue Y.H. Fujikake N. Matsukage A. Kakizuka A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, VCP(K524A), an ATPase activity-negative mutant has been shown to cause ER stress, vacuole formation, and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the membrane fraction followed by cell death (17Kobayashi T. Tanaka K. Inoue K. Kakizuka A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47358-47365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These phenotypes are very similar to those observed in the pathology of several human neurodegenerative disorders (see above); we thus have called VCP vacuole-creating protein (9Hirabayashi M. Inoue K. Tanaka K. Nakadate K. Ohsawa Y. Kamei Y. Popiel A.H. Sinohara A. Iwamatsu A. Kimura Y. Uchiyama Y. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18Mizuno Y. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Okamoto K. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 343: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Consistent with these phenotypes, VCP ATPase activities have been shown to be essential in ERAD (15Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 16Rabinovich E. Kerem A. Frohlich K.U. Diamant N. Bar-Nun S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47358-47365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that excessive accumulation of misfolded proteins inactivates VCP ATPase activity, leading to the pathological processes of neuronal cell death in these neurodegenerative disorders (2Kobayashi T. Kakizuka A. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2003; 100: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Kobayashi T. Tanaka K. Inoue K. Kakizuka A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47358-47365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to clarify the regulatory mechanism of VCP ATPase activity. However, no molecular mechanism in the regulation of VCP ATPase activity has as yet been demonstrated. VCP has also been proposed to be involved in other pathological conditions such as advanced cancers (20Yamamoto S. Tomita Y. Nakamori S. Hoshida Y. Nagano H. Dono K. Umeshita K. Sakon M. Monden M.

Wymer J. Kovach M.J. Mehta S.G. Mumm S. Darvish D. Pestronk A. Whyte M.P. Kimonis V.E. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Many lines of evidence have suggested crucial involvement of oxidative stress in a variety of physiological processes as well as pathological processes such as aging, cancer, diabetes, and several human neurodegenerative disorders (23Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine, 3rd Ed. 1999; (pp. , Oxford University Press, Oxford, NY): 617-783Google Scholar). Especially in Parkinson disease, oxidized proteins are observed in Lewy bodies from early stages (24Koutsilieri E. Scheller C. Grunblatt E. Nara K. Li J. Riederer P. J. Neurol. 2002; 249 (Suppl. 2, -II5): II1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Drugs such as 6-hydroxydopamine, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, paraquat, rotenone, etc., which can specifically kill the dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and, thus, are used in the creation of Parkinson disease models, have been shown to create oxidative stress; antioxidants can inhibit cell death caused by these drugs (24Koutsilieri E. Scheller C. Grunblatt E. Nara K. Li J. Riederer P. J. Neurol. 2002; 249 (Suppl. 2, -II5): II1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dauer W. Przedborski S. Neuron. 2003; 39: 889-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4011) Google Scholar). Indeed, several drugs that are known to function as antioxidants have certain, if not strong efficacy on several neurodegenerative disorders (26Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53 (Suppl. 3): 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27Fariss M.W. Zhang J.G. Toxicology. 2003; 189: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, no target molecule of oxidative stress has as yet been identified in such pathological processes. Recent studies have revealed that oxidative stress, especially NO, induces cell death via ER stress (28Kawahara K. Oyadomari S. Gotoh T. Kohsaka S. Nakayama H. Mori M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Oyadomari S. Takeda K. Takiguchi M. Gotoh T. Matsumoto M. Wada I. Akira S. Araki E. Mori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10845-10850Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance and molecular mechanisms that link oxidative stress to ER stress response have not yet been clarified. Recently, it has been shown that several enzymatic activities are regulated by oxidative modifications of cysteine residues, e.g. those in caspase-3, OxyR, and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (30Mannick J.B.

Keng T. DeAngelo J. Hausladen A. Stamler J.S. Cell. 2002; 109 (Jr.): 383-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), a reversible post-translational modification of cysteine residues that includes disulfide bond formation, S-nitrosylation, S-glutathionylation, and S-hydroxylation. The accumulation of S-thiolated proteins has been observed in response to oxidative stress in vivo (33Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar, 34Pastore A. Tozzi G. Gaeta L.M. Bertini E. Serafini V. Di Cesare S. Bonetto V. Casoni F. Carrozzo R.

In this paper we report that VCP was modulated and regulated by oxidative stress. VCP ATPase activity was inhibited by various oxidants. With LC/MS we found several cysteine residues that were modified under such conditions. Among them, we identified the Cys-522 as the modification site responsible for the oxidative inactivation. This study not only clarifies the regulatory mechanism of VCP ATPase activity for the first time but also provides the novel idea that oxidative modulation of VCP is a crucial event that links oxidative stress and ER stress response in certain physiological as well as pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration. Expression and Purification of His-VCP—cDNA encoding His-VCP or His-Cdc48p was subcloned in a baculovirus expression vector or pDEST26 (N-His tag), a mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). Recombinant His-VCPs and His-Cdc48p were expressed in insect Sf-9 cells or HEK293F cells by transfection and were purified via subsequent procedures (17Kobayashi T. Tanaka K. Inoue K. Kakizuka A. J.

After the recombinant VCPs were eluted with a 50–500 mm imidazole gradient, VCPs were kept in a storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20% glycerol). Antibodies—Anti-VCP, anti-p47, anti-Npl4, and anti-Ufd1 antibodies were developed by the standard procedures described previously (9Hirabayashi M. Inoue K. Tanaka K. Nakadate K. Ohsawa Y. Kamei Y.

A rat polyclonal anti-GSH antibody (Chemicon), mouse monoclonal anti-actin and anti-polyubiquitin antibodies (Chemicon), and a rabbit polyclonal anti-CHOP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were purchased. Measurement of the ATPase Activities—The ATPase activities of VCP were measured in 20 μl of the ATPase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) with 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 Ci/mmol)(Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 10 min following the procedure already described (35Chevalier M. King L. Blond S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 384-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After incubation, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 200 μl of 7% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid solution with 1 mm K2HPO4, and then 50 μl of solution A (3.75% ammonium molybdate, 0.02 m silicotungstic acid in 3 N H2SO4) and 300 μl of n-butyl acetate were added to the reaction. The samples were mixed and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min. Then, 200-μl aliquots from the upper organic phases were taken, and their radioactivity was determined with a liquid scintillation counter for β-radiation, which determined the amounts of 32P released. Peptide Mass Finger Printing Method—After DTT treatment, recombinant VCP was incubated with oxidants and then treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 20 min, washed with acetone, and dried. Next, the samples were treated with 55 mm IAA in ST buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) for 15 min, dialyzed in 20 mm NH4HCO3, and treated with 12.5 μg/ml trypsin 37 °C for 3 h. The tryptic-digested peptides were analyzed by LC/MS (Waters, 2795 separation module/Thermo Finningan, LCQ Deca XP plus). Purification of FLAG-VCP—HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-VCP expression vectors. Forty-eight hours after transfection cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1.5 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 and then lysed in a Triton lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100) containing 40 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm NaVO4, 0.5 mm NaPPi, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). After removing the debris by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 × g, the supernatants were mixed with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) and then stirred at 4 °C overnight. Then the gels were rinsed with Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2), and FLAG-VCP was eluted with the 40 μg of the FLAG peptide (Sigma). Detection of S-Glutathionylation of Recombinant His-VCP—Purified His-VCP was incubated with 100 μm GSH, 500 μm diamide, 500 μm diamide plus 100 μm GSH, 10 mm GSSG, 10 mm GSNO at 37 °C for 30 min. Alternatively, His-VCP was incubated with 98 μm GSH plus 2 μm [35S]GSH (30 Ci/mmol)(Amersham Biosciences) with and without 500 μm diamide at 37 °C for 30 min. With or without subsequent treatment with 30 mm DTT, the samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then subjected to non-reducing 7.5% SDS-PAGE (300 ng of VCP/lane), and VCP was detected by Western blot analysis with an anti-GSH antibody (Chemicon) or by autoradiography. Labeling of S-Glutathionylated Proteins with [35S]Cysteine in HEK293T Cells—HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-VCP expression vectors. Twenty-four hours after transfection, culture medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking sulfur-containing amino acids supplemented with 10% dialyzed serum at 37 °C for 16 h; they were then further incubated in the presence of cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) for additional 1 h at 37 °C and labeled with 30 nm [35S]cysteine (1000 Ci/mmol) at 37 °C for 4 h. Then the cells were washed 3 times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and treated with or without 5 mm diamide in serum-free media at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with Triton lysis buffer containing either 50 mm NEM or 25 mm DTT; NEM was used to modify free sulfhydryls to prevent scrambling of the label in the lysates by thiol-disulfide exchange; DTT was used to reverse protein 35S-labeled thiolation so as to distinguish the DTT-sensitive post-translational modifications from the cysteine incorporation in the protein backbone. After FLAG-VCP had been purified from lysates based on the above methods, VCP was subjected to non-reducing 7.5% SDS-PAGE (300 ng of VCP/lane) and detected by autoradiography. Yeast Strains—The genotype of yeast strains are: W303, MATa can1-100 ade2-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1; Y529, MATa Δcdc48::HIS3 ade2-1 ura3-1 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 E305(pRS314/CDC48); Y530, MATa Δcdc48::HIS3 ade2-1 ura3-1 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 E307(pRS314/cdc48[T532C]). Yeasts were grown in YPAD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose and 0.004% adenine with or without 2% agar) or in synthetic complete medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base and 2% glucose supplemented with amino acids and nucleotide bases with or without 2% agar). Growth Assay of Yeasts—Plates that contained oxidants were prepared a day before use and stored overnight at 4 °C in the dark. The spot assay was performed as described previously; after adjustment of the A600 at 1.0, yeasts were serially diluted from 10-1 up to 10-4, and 5 μl of each diluted sample was spotted on the plates (approximately, 10,000, 1,000, 100, 10 cells per spot) (36Flattery-O'Brien J.A. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The yeasts on paraquat plates were incubated for 6 days, and those on the other plates were incubated for 3 days, and then their photographs were taken. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Yeasts—After adjustment of the A600 at 0.3, yeast strains grown in the synthetic dropout (SD) medium were treated with diamide at 30 °C for 12 h. Each sample was then fixed in 70% ethanol, resuspended in a Tris-citrate buffer (180 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 180 mm NaCl, 70 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sodium citrate), briefly sonicated, and digested with 0.25 mg/ml RNase in the same buffer followed by the proteinase K treatment (1 mg/ml), each for an hour at 50 °C. DNA was stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 50,000 cells from each sample were scanned with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) as described previously (37Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Each experiment was conducted at least three times with consistent results. The representative gel or blot from each experiment is presented in this study. The statistical significance was analyzed using Student's t test. VCP Is Modified by S-Glutathionylation in Response to Oxidative Stress—We found VCP was modified by DTT-sensitive S-glutathionylation after the treatment with diamide plus GSH, GSSG, or GSNO in vitro (Fig. 1A). Recombinant VCP was treated with diamide plus GSH, GSSG, or GSNO, subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blot analysis with an anti-GSH antibody (Fig. 1A). When VCP was preincubated with GSH or diamide alone, no bands were detected with the anti-GSH antibody, and VCP was detected at a position corresponding to 97 kDa. However, when VCP was preincubated with diamide plus GSH, GSSG, or GSNO, VCP was detected with the anti-GSH antibody, and its migration positions shifted to the upper positions. S-Glutathionylation is a covalent but reversible modification of cysteine residues with GSH and is removed by DTT treatment (38Ward N.E. Stewart J.R. Ioannides C.G. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10319-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After this DTT treatment, the bands detected by the antibody actually disappeared, and their migration positions were restored to those corresponding to 97 kDa (Fig. 1A). Moreover, we were able to detect S-glutathionylation of VCP using non-reducing SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography; [35S]GSH signals were detected on VCP when VCP was treated with diamide plus [35S]GSH, but after DTT treatment, these [35S]GSH signals disappeared (Fig. 1B). These results clearly demonstrate that VCP can be modified reversibly by GSH in vitro. Next, we examined whether VCP can be modified by GSH in cultured cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with a FLAG-VCP expression vector and were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine in the presence of cycloheximide; in this condition most [35S]cysteines have been shown to be used for GSH synthesis (38Ward N.E. Stewart J.R. Ioannides C.G. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10319-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Then these cells were treated with diamide, and FLAG-VCP was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG affinity beads and subj"
https://openalex.org/W2094617467,"Med5 (Nut1) is identified here as a component of the Mediator tail region. Med5 is positioned peripherally to Med16 (Sin4) together with the three members of the putative Gal11 module, Med15 (Gal11), Med2, and Med3 (Pgd1). The biochemical analysis receives support from genetic interactions between med5Δ and med15Δ deletions. The med5Δ and med16Δ deletion strains share many phenotypes, including effects on mitochondrial function with enhanced growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, increased citrate synthase activity, and increased oxygen consumption. Deletion of the MED5 gene leads to increased transcription of nuclear genes encoding components of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, whereas mitochondrial genes encoding components of the same machinery are down-regulated. We discuss a possible role for Med5 in coordinating nuclear and mitochondrial gene transcription. Med5 (Nut1) is identified here as a component of the Mediator tail region.

The multiprotein Mediator complex is required for basal and regulated expression of nearly all RNA polymerase II (pol II) 3The abbreviations used are: pol IIpolymerase IIOXPHOSoxidative phosphorylationHAThistone acetyltransferase.-dependent genes in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Mediator conveys regulatory information from enhancers and other control elements to the promoter (1Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The functional activities identified for Mediator include stimulation of basal transcription, support of activated transcription, and enhancement of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of pol II by the transcription factor IIH kinase (2Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 3Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Mediator also contains a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which is not found in other eukaryotic Mediator complexes (4Lorch Y. Beve J. Gustafsson C.M. Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 197-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The HAT activity was localized to Med5 (Nut1), a S. cerevisiae-specific protein, which lacks homologues in higher eukaryotes (4Lorch Y. Beve J. Gustafsson C.M. Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 197-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Gustafsson C.M. Myers L.C. Beve J. Spahr H. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30851-30854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The MED5 gene was originally isolated in a screen for mutants that would suppress the Swi4/Swi6 dependence of a synthetic reporter gene containing part of the HO promoter (6Tabtiang R.K. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4707-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Several other genes encoding Mediator proteins were identified in the same screen, including MED10 (NUT2), MED16 (SIN4), MED19 (ROX3), MED12 (SRB8), MED13 (SRB9), CDK8 (SRB10), and CYCC (SRB11). The MED5 gene is nonessential in yeast. A deletion of MED5 relieves repression at the URS2 element in the HO promoter but only in combination with a mutant allele of either MED10 or CCR4 (6Tabtiang R.K. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4707-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These effects on the HO promoter were seen with a lacZ reporter gene but not at the endogenous HO gene locus. The in vivo role of Med5 in Mediator-dependent gene expression therefore remains an open question. polymerase II oxidative phosphorylation histone acetyltransferase. In the presence of RNA pol II, Mediator adopts an extended conformation that embraces the globular pol II core complex (7Asturias F.J. Jiang Y.W. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1999; 283: 985-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The extended structure reveals three distinct submodules of Mediator. Direct contacts are formed between pol II and the head and middle region (7Asturias F.J. Jiang Y.W. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1999; 283: 985-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 8Dotson M.R. Yuan C.X. Roeder R.G. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Jiang Y.W. Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Asturias F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14307-14310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The largest part of Mediator is made up of an elongated tail region, which does not appear to contact pol II. Structural analysis of mutant Mediator complex has demonstrated that the tail region contains the Med2, Med3, Med15 (Gal11), and Med16, proteins, which are involved in interactions with a number of different activators, including Gal4 and Gcn4 (9Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Hayashibara K.C. Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The Med2, Med3, and Med15 proteins form a module (the Gal11 module), which in part may function as a separate entity. In cells lacking Med16, the Gal11 module is detached from Mediator and recruited as a separate entity to the ARG1 promoter by the yeast activator Gcn4 (10Zhang F. Sumibcay L. Hinnebusch A.G. Swanson M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6871-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this free Med2-Med3-Med15-containing complex recruits TBP and pol II to the promoter, and cells that lack Med16 show no defects in the induced expression levels of either of the two Gcn4-dependent ARG1 and SNZ1 genes, even though the middle or head module Mediator subunits cannot be detected at these promoters. It is possible that alternative activator-coactivator complex formations are functional at the ARG1 and SNZ1 genes and that the isolated tail module might interact with, for example, the SAGA or SWI/SNF complexes in a way that is sufficient for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex. We have characterized the Med5 protein here and demonstrate that it is a component of the Mediator tail domain. We find that the in vivo role of Med5 is related to the function of other components in the tail module. Med5 influences the regulated expression of nuclear encoded components of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery, and deletion of the MED5 gene affects both carbon source usage and oxygen consumption. Antibodies and Immunoblot Analyses—Synthetic polypeptides corresponding to amino acids 1-15 of Med5 were used to immunize rabbits. The antisera used in this study were taken 10 days after the second booster injection (Innovagen AB, Lund, Sweden). Immunoblot analysis for Mediator proteins was as described (3Myers L.C.

Other antibodies used in this study were kindly provided by Drs. R. A. Young (Med18 (Srb5) and Med20 (Srb2)), Y.-J. Kim (Med14 (Rgr1) and Med16), and A. Aguilera (Med3). Recombinant Proteins—DNA fragments encoding S. cerevisiae Med2, Med3, Med5, Med15, and Med16 were amplified from genomic DNA. PCR products were cloned into the vectors pBacPAK8 or pBacPAK9 (Clontech). Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis viruses recombinant for the individual proteins were constructed as described in the BacPAK manual (Clontech). Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were maintained and propagated in suspension in SFM 900 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal calf serum at 27 °C. For protein expression, Sf9 cells were grown in suspension and harvested 60-72 h postinfection. Infected cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1× protease inhibitors (for all purifications a 100× stock of protease inhibitors contained 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 mm pepstatin A, 60 mm leupeptin, and 200 mm benzamidine in 100% ethanol). The cells were incubated on ice for 20 min, transferred to a Dounce homogenizer, and disrupted using 20 strokes of a tight-fitting pestle. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1.5 m, and the homogenate was swirled gently for 40 min at 4 °C. The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C using a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor. Protein Purification—Purification of the RNA pol II holoenzyme and mutant versions thereof was as described previously (9Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Hayashibara K.C. Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For purification of the Med2-Med3 dimer, Sf9 cells were co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing Med2 and Pgd1 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for each virus. After lysis and centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer Q-0.1 (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitors; the number after the hyphen (e.g. Q-0.1) indicates the potassium acetate concentration in molar units) overnight. The dialyzed material was loaded on a Mono Q 5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated in buffer Q-0.1. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer Q-0.1 and eluted by a linear gradient (15 ml) of buffer Q-0.1-1.0. The Med2-Pgd1 dimer eluted at about 700 mm KAc. The eluate was dialyzed against buffer A-0.08 (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitors; the number after the hyphen (e.g. A-0.08) indicates the potassium acetate concentration in molar units) overnight. The dialyzed material was applied to a Mono S 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated in buffer A-0.1. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A-0.1, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (15 ml) of buffer A-0.1-1.0. A peak of the Med2-Med3 dimer eluted around 0.45 m KAc. The peak fractions were dialyzed against buffer H-0.07 (20 mm K·PO4, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0; the number after the hyphen (e.g. H-0.07) indicates the potassium acetate concentration in molar units) for 4 h and loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with buffer H containing 100 mm KAc. Essentially pure Med2-Med3 eluted around 0.40 m KAc. The peak fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and finally stored at -80 °C. For purification of the Med2-Med3-Med5-Med15 tetramer, Sf9 cells were co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing all of these proteins at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for each virus. After lysis and centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A-0.1. A 15-ml S-Sepharose FF (Amersham Bioscience) column was washed with 45 ml of buffer A-0.1, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (150 ml) of buffer A-0.1-1.0. A peak of the Med2-Med3-Med5-Med15 tetramer eluted around 0.45 m KAc. The peak fractions were dialyzed against buffer H-0.1 and loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column that had been equilibrated with buffer H containing 100 mm KAc. The Med2-Med3-Med5-Med15 tetramer eluted around 400 mm KAc. The peak fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and finally stored at -80 °C. To determine the apparent molecular weight of the Med2-Med3 dimer and the Med2-Med3-Med5-Med15 tetramer, a portion (0.5 ml) of the Mono S (Med2-Med3) or the heparin peak (Med2-Med3-Med5-Med15) was applied to a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Q-0.2. Affymetrix GeneChip Probe Array Analyses and Real-time PCR—Total yeast RNA was isolated using a hot acid phenol extraction protocol (11Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from total RNA using the Oligotex Midi Kit (Qiagen). The cDNA synthesis, cRNA synthesis, and labeling, as well as array hybridization to Affymetrix yeast S98 arrays, were performed at the Karolinska Institute Affymetrix core facility as described in the Affymetrix users' manual (30Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. 2000; (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)Google Scholar). Washing and staining of arrays were performed using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 and by scanning with the Affymetrix GeneArray scanner. Acquisition and quantification of array images as well as primary data analysis were performed using Affymetrix GeneChip operating software (GCOS) 1.2. The transcription analysis was performed with RNA prepared from two wild type and two med5Δ cell cultures. Each of the two wild type RNA preparations was compared with both of the med5Δ RNA preparations, generating a total of four comparisons. Genes absent according to the Affymetrix detection algorithm on both arrays of a comparison were excluded from the presented data. Genes were included if the Affymetrix change algorithm gave significant change calls (p < 0.0025) in all four comparisons. To verify changes in gene transcription, real-time quantitative PCR was carried out on ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system with Absolute QPCR SYBR Green reagents (Applied Biosystem) and primers at a concentration of 0.5 μm. PCR conditions were standardized to 40 cycles: 95 °C for 15 s followed by 60 °C for 1 min. The -fold change reported in TABLE THREE is the average of at least three separate experiments. Primer sequences are available upon request.TABLE THREEGenes affected in a med5Δ strain Shown are genes in which expression is most affected in a med5Δ strain as compared with the wild type. The -fold change is given as an average of all four comparisons. For expression analysis, we used the Affymetrix yeast S98 arrays as described under “Materials and Methods.” Some of the changes in gene transcription were verified with real-time quantitative PCR, and real-time fold changes (RT/FC) from these experiments are indicated in the table.

For disruption of MED5, the KanMX4 cassette was amplified from Y04518 (med5::KanMX4) with primers binding to sequences 500 bp upstream and downstream of the cassette. The KanMX4-containing DNA fragment was used to construct the JB001 and JB002 strains using standard genetics methods (12Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 13Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). The Y04393, Y01742, Y01976, Y04518, and Y13701 strains were from the Euroscarf collection. A MED5-encoding DNA fragment was amplified from the yeast strain W303-1A including 500 bp upstream and downstream of the open reading frame by PCR (forward primer: 5′-CCGGGGATCCTTTCCATATCTCCTAATGGT-3′; reverse primer: 5′-CCGGCCCGGGCCGCAGCTGACACTGTTATA-3′).

Exponentially growing cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was washed once with water and once with YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol). The cultures were diluted with YPG to an initial OD of 0.1-0.2, and the growth was monitored by OD measurements for ∼60 h. For measurements of respiration rates, cells were grown exponentially for 12-24 h in synthetic complete (SC) medium (yeast nitrogen base supplemented with ammonium sulfate (Qbiogene catalog no. 4027-512), 2% glucose, and amino acids). The cultures were then diluted to OD 0.1-0.15, and respiration was measured after 2-3 generations. Oxygen consumption in whole cells was measured using a Clarke electrode connected to a CB1-D3-02 control box (Hansatech, KingsLynn, United Kingdom). Exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1800 rpm in a clinical centrifuge (Jouan CR422) and washed once with water and twice with 40 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4. We estimated the cell count using a Bürker counting chamber. The respiration rate was measured at 30 °C by adding 2.5 × 107 cells to a water-jacked chamber containing 1 ml of 40 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, with 1% glucose added as substrate. Cyanide-sensitive respiration was calculated after the addition of 1 mm KCN when the cyanide-insensitive respiration was subtracted from the total respiration. Measurements were repeated at least three times for each individual strain. Measurement of Citrate Synthase Activity and Mitochondrial Volume Density—Exponentially growing cells (OD 0.5-0.8) in SC-glucose medium were harvested by centrifugation at 1800 rpm and +4°C in a clinical centrifuge (Jouan CR422) and washed once with water followed by two washes with buffer J (0.138 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.01 m Na·PO4, pH 7.4, 1 m sorbitol). Approximately 108 cells were resuspended in 0.6 ml of buffer J and incubated with 400 units of lyticase at 30 °C for 50-60 min to digest the cell wall. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with buffer J, and frozen at -20 °C. Citrate synthase activity was determined in triplicate for each strain as described previously (14Wibom R. Hagenfeldt L. von Dobeln U. Anal.

Volume density measurements of mitochondria on electron micrographs were performed as described previously (16Ekstrand M.I. Falkenberg M. Rantanen A. Park C.B. Gaspari M. Hultenby K. Rustin P.

Med5 Is a Component of the Mediator Tail Module—We and others have reported previously that the Med5 protein is present in highly purified preparations of the S. cerevisiae Mediator complex (5Gustafsson C.M. Myers L.C. Beve J. Spahr H. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30851-30854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Liu Y. Ranish J.A. Aebersold R. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7169-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To further verify that Med5 is a stable component of Mediator, we raised polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 15 amino acids of Med5. The Med5 protein co-purified with Mediator on Bio-Rex70, DEAE-Sepharose FF, hydroxyapatite, Mono Q, and Superose 6. Immunoblot analysis showed co-elution from Superose 6 of Med5 with Med2 and Med20 (Fig. 1A). Several nonessential Mediator subunits (Med2, Med3, Med15, and Med16) have previously been localized to the Mediator tail module, and we therefore investigated the presence of Med5 in Mediator purified from med2Δ, med3Δ, med15Δ, and med16Δ mutant strains. We found Med5 present in Mediator from the med2Δ, med3Δ, and med15Δ strains, demonstrating that Med5 does not depend on any of the encoded proteins for stable interaction with the rest of the Mediator (Fig. 1B). Analysis of Mediator from the med16Δ strain did, however, not only reveal a loss of the known Gal11 module proteins, as reported previously (9Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Hayashibara K.C. Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), but also a loss of Med5 (Fig. 1C). We therefore conclude that Med5 is a new component of the Mediator tail module and that it is located peripherally to Med16, together with subunits of the Gall11 submodule. Our attempts to purify Mediator from a med5Δ strain and analyze its subunit composition proved difficult, because the mutant Mediator complex precipitated during later stages of protein purification. We could however use immunoblot analysis to demonstrate that the med5Δ mutant Mediator purified as a multiprotein complex, which still contained the other tail module components Med2 and Med16 (Fig. 1D). Med5 Interacts with the Gal11 Module—We constructed recombinant baculoviruses for expression of Med2, Med3, Med5, Med15, and Med16 and investigated the association of these subunits by co-expression in insect cells. When Med2 and Med3 are expressed together, they form a soluble complex that can be purified to near homogeneity. Gel filtration analysis demonstrated that the Med2-Med3 complex had an apparent molecular weight of about 90 kDa, suggesting that the two proteins form a stable dimer with a molar ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 2A). Med15 was insoluble even when co-expressed with the Med2-Med3 complex, and we therefore could not demonstrate the existence of a separate Med2-Med3-Med15 subcomplex. Similarly, Med5 was insoluble when expressed on its own (data now shown), but co-expression of Med5 with Med2, Med3, and Med15 generated a soluble tetrameric complex that could be purified as a single entity over Mono S and heparin-Sepharose FF (Fig. 2B, data not shown). Gel filtration chromatography indicated that the Med2-Med3-Med5-Med15 complex had a size of about 500 kDa, roughly corresponding to the combined molecular masses of the four proteins (Fig. 2C). Our experiments demonstrated that a Med2-Med3-Med5-Med15 complex can be formed in vitro, which is consistent with the existence of a distinct Gal11 module. On the basis of our biochemical analysis, we propose a structural model of the mediator tail domain in which Med5 is localized peripherally to Med16 and in complex with Med2, Med3, and Med15 (Fig. 2D). Genetic Interactions of MED5 with MED15 and MED21—We next monitored genetic interactions between MED5 and genes encoding other Mediator subunits. We found a synthetic lethality between the med5Δ knock-out and med21-ts (Fig. 3A). The latter allele, which is temperature-sensitive at 38 °C, encodes an N-terminally truncated Med21 protein that lacks amino acid residues 2-8. 4M. Hallberg, G.-Z. Hu, D. Balciunas, Z. Shaikhibrahim, S. Björklund, and H. Ronne, manuscript submitted for publication. We also found a synthetic interaction between the med5Δ and med15Δ knock-outs. The med5Δ med15Δ double knock-out strain is temperature-sensitive at 35 °C, as compared with 38 °C for the med15Δ strain and no temperature sensitivity for the med5Δ strain (Fig. 3B). No synthetic interaction was observed between the med5Δ and med16Δ knock-outs (data not shown), which is consistent with the finding that loss of Med16 also leads to loss of Med5 (Fig. 1C) and supports a localization of Med5 peripherally to Med16 (Fig. 2D). med5Δ Strain Displays Increased Respiration—The med2Δ, med3Δ, med15Δ, and med16Δ strains all exhibit gal- phenotypes, whereas the med5Δ strain is gal+ (data not shown). This is consistent with our observation that Med5 is not required for association of the Gal11 module with Mediator (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the med5Δ strain grows significantly better than the wild type strain on the nonfermentable carbon source glycerol (Fig. 3C and data not shown). Enhanced growth on glycerol was also seen for some other Mediator mutant strains, including med16Δ, med1Δ and cycCΔ. In contrast, deletion of MED15, GCN5 (encoding a component of the SAGA complex), or ELP3 (encoding a component of the Elongator complex) produced a slow growth phenotype (Fig. 3, C and D). We also compared oxygen consumption in wild type and mutant yeast strains using a Clarke electrode. The med5Δ deletion caused a near 2-fold increase in oxygen consumption compared with a wild type strain (Fig. 4A). Other Mediator mutants, including med1Δ, med16Δ, and cycCΔ, also caused increased oxygen consumption, whereas the consumption dropped below that of the wild type in the gcn5Δ and elp3Δ strains. The enhanced growth on glycerol and increased oxygen consumption, suggested an increased respiratory activity in some of the Mediator mutant strains. Citrate synthase is one of the key enzymes in the tricarboxcylic cycle, and citrate synthase activity is used as an indicator of mitochondrial mass in eukaryotic cells. We compared citrate synthase activity in the wild type, med5Δ, and med16Δ strains. The citrate synthase activity was increased in the Mediator mutant strains and correlated well with the previously determined oxygen consumption (Fig. 4B). We also performed volume density measurements of mitochondria on e"

However, an unusual location of the Na,K-ATPase was detected in polarized HGT-1 cells (a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line). The Na,K-ATPase alpha1 subunit was detected along with the beta2 subunit predominantly on the apical membrane, whereas the Na,K-ATPase beta1 subunit was not found in HGT-1 cells. However, when expressed in the same cell line, a yellow fluorescent protein-linked Na,K-ATPase beta1 subunit was localized exclusively to the basolateral surface and resulted in partial redistribution of the endogenous alpha1 subunit to the basolateral membrane. The human beta2 subunit has eight N-glycosylation sites, whereas the beta1 isoform has only three. Accordingly, up to five additional N-glycosylation sites homologous to the ones present in the beta2 subunit were successively introduced in the beta1 subunit by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutated beta1 subunits were detected on both apical and basolateral membranes. The fraction of a mutant beta1 subunit present on the apical membrane increased in proportion to the number of glycosylation sites inserted and reached 80% of the total surface amount for the beta1 mutant with five additional sites. Clustered distribution and co-localization with caveolin-1 was detected by confocal microscopy for the endogenous beta2 subunit and the beta1 mutant with additional glycosylation sites but not for the wild type beta1 subunit. Hence, the N-glycans linked to the beta2 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase contain apical sorting information, and the high abundance of the beta2 subunit isoform, which is rich in N-glycans, along with the absence of the beta1 subunit, is responsible for the unusual apical location of the Na,K-ATPase in HGT-1 cells."

Staphylocoagulase (SC), a protein secreted by the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, activates prothrombin (ProT) without proteolysis. The SC·(pro)thrombin complex recognizes Fbg as a specific substrate, converting it directly into fibrin. The crystal structure of a fully active SC fragment containing residues 1-325 (SC-(1-325)) bound to human prethrombin 2 showed previously that SC inserts its Ile1-Val2 N terminus into the Ile16 pocket of prethrombin 2, inducing a functional active site in the cognate zymogen conformationally. Exosite I of α-thrombin, the Fbg recognition site, and proexosite I on ProT are blocked by domain 2 of SC-(1-325). In the present studies, active site-labeled fluorescent ProT analogs were used to quantitate Fbg binding to the SC-(1-325)·ProT complex. Fbg binding and cleavage are mediated by expression of a new Fbg-binding exosite on the SC-(1-325)·ProT complex, resulting in formation of an (SC-(1-325)·ProT)2·Fbg pentameric complex with a dissociation constant of 8-34 nm. In both crystal structures, the SC-(1-325)·(pre)thrombin complexes form dimers, with both proteinases/zymogens facing each other over a large U-shaped cleft, through which the Fbg substrate could thread.

We recently solved the crystal structure of the immediate human thrombin zymogen precursor, prethrombin 2 (Pre 2), bound to an SC fragment, SC-(1-325), which possesses full ProT activator and Fbg clotting activity (3Friedrich R.

The structure demonstrates that SC activates ProT conformationally by a mechanism known as “molecular sexuality” (5Bode W. Huber R. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Serine proteinase zymogens are activated normally by cleavage at Arg15-(Ile/Val)16 activation sites (using the chymotrypsinogen numbering for the catalytic domain residues of serine proteinases). This cleavage liberates a new N terminus with a typical (Ile/Val)16-(Val/Ile)17 sequence, which inserts into the “Ile16 pocket” of the zymogen and forms a strong salt bridge with the Asp194 carboxylate (5Bode W. Huber R. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6Bode W. Schwager P. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 118: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Formation of this critical salt bridge triggers folding of the “activation domain” of the zymogen, resulting in formation of the substrate-binding site and oxyanion hole (7Khan A. James M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). As postulated in the molecular sexuality hypothesis, the N-terminal SC-(1-325) dipeptide, SCIle1-Val2, occupies the Ile16 pocket of the cognate Pre 2, similar to the endogenous TIle16-Val17 N terminus in mature α-thrombin (8Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The SC-(1-325)·Pre 2 and thrombin structures raised questions concerning the nature of Fbg substrate recognition and cleavage by the SC-(1-325)·(pro)thrombin complexes because domain 2 (D2) of SC-(1-325) blocks exosite I, the Fbg recognition site. Fbg is a large glycoprotein (Mr =∼340,000), formed by three pairs of Aα-, Bβ-, and γ-chains covalently linked to form a “dimer of trimers,” where A and B designate the fibrinopeptides released by thrombin cleavage. The elongated molecule folds into three separate domains, a central fragment E that contains the N termini of all six chains and two flanking fragments D formed mainly by the C termini of the Bβ- and γ-chains. These globular domains are connected by long triple-helical structures (9Brown J.H. Volkmann N. Jun G. Henschen-Edman A.H. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SC·(pro)thrombin complexes, which efficiently convert human Fbg to the self-polymerizing Fbn, are not targeted by circulating thrombin inhibitors (12Hendrix H. Lindhout T. Mertens K. Engels W.

(Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, SC action bypasses the physiological blood coagulation pathway. Fbg interactions with specific residues located in thrombin exosite I are required for fibrinopeptide removal and consequent Fbn generation (14Stubbs M.T. Oschkinat H. Mayr I. Huber R. Angliker H.

For example, the reversal-of-charge mutant Arg73 → Glu is severely compromised as a Fbg activator (16Wu Q.Y. Sheehan J.P. Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Birktoft J.J. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Further, variants in which alanine replaces residues Lys70, His71 or Tyr76 are practically devoid of Fbg clotting ability, and mutants Arg73 → Ala and Arg77A → Ala possess Fbg clotting activities below 25% of wild-type thrombin (17Tsiang M.

Finally, occupancy of exosite I by the physiological regulator of the blood coagulation cascade, thrombomodulin (18Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J.

Because the major Fbg recognition surface on α-thrombin is blocked in the SC-bound complexes, the mechanism of Fbg clotting by cofactor-bound (pro)thrombin differs from that of the free enzyme. Investigation of the underlying mechanism was the goal of the present studies. Quantitation of interactions between Fbg and the SC-(1-325)·ProT complexes supports the conclusion that SC-(1-325) mediates specific Fbg binding and cleavage by expression of a new Fbg-binding exosite absent in the individual proteins.

SC-(1-325) and Met-SC-(1-325) were expressed, purified, and characterized as described previously (3Friedrich R. Panizzi P. Fuentes-Prior P. Richter K. Verhamme I. Anderson P.J. Kawabata S. Huber R. Bode W. Bock P.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Dynamic Light Scattering—Laser light scattering experiments were performed by the use of fast protein liquid chromatography Superdex 200 HR10/30 gel filtration with in-line 90° light scattering measured by a PD2010 detector (Precision Detectors). Met-SC-(1-325) samples of 0.5 ml (5.1 mg/ml) were chromatographed at 0.75 ml/min in 50 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Well resolved bovine serum albumin monomer, dimer, and trimer peaks were used to calibrate the detector for molecular weight determinations. Analytical Equilibrium Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with a Beckman XL-I ultracentrifuge equipped with UV-visible optics. The runs were performed at 0.1-0.3 mg/ml protein in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, at varying salt concentrations. For determination of the molecular weight of the SC-(1-325)·(pre)thrombin complexes in solution, thrombin or Pre 2 were mixed with SC-(1-325) at a 1:1.1 molar ratio and subjected to centrifugation. The samples were centrifuged for 48-72 h at 8 °C at 9,000 rpm until equilibrium was reached, and the concentration gradient was scanned at 280 nm. The data were evaluated by calculating the partial specific volume from the amino acid composition. The data analysis was based on the assumption of a single species at equilibrium. Fluorescence Studies—Fluorescence was measured with an SLM 8100 fluorometer, using polyethylene glycol 20,000-coated acrylic cuvettes. The experiments were performed in 50 mm Hepes, 110 mm NaCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Parallel measurements on blanks lacking the labeled species were used to correct for background. Binding of SC-(1-325) to various labeled ProT analogs was measured in titrations of labeled ProT monitoring the change in fluorescence at the following probe emission wavelengths (nm) of ProT labeled with: dansylaziridine (DAN), 506; 2-((4′-iodoacetamido)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (ANS), 438; 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (ACR), 502; 6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethyl-aminonaphthalene (BAD), 510; the sulfonated coumarin derivative called AlexaFluor 350 C5 maleimide (AF350), 436; BODIPY® 507/545 iodoacetamide or N-(4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-2-yl)iodoacetamide (BD), 535; tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide dihydroiodide (TMR), 580; 4′-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein (4′F), 521; and 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein (5F) and Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide or 5-(and 6)-(iodoacetamido)-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein (OG), 520. The probes were excited at wavelengths (nm): DAN, 343; ANS, 335; ACR, 398; BAD, 400; AF350, 352; BD, 506; TMR, 550; and 4′F, 5F, and OG, 490. Fluorescence changes expressed as (Fobs-Fo)/Fo = ΔF/Fo, measured as a function of total SC-(1-325) concentration, and fit by the quadratic binding equation, with the maximum fluorescence change ((Fmax-Fo)/Fo =ΔFmax/Fo), dissociation constant (KD), and stoichiometric factor (n) the fitted parameters. Nonlinear least squares fitting was performed with SCIENTIST (MicroMath). The error estimates represent the 95% confidence interval. Affinity Chromatography on Fbg-Agarose—Fbg-agarose (5.4 mg/ml gel) was prepared by coupling Fbg (fraction I; Sigma) to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fast protein liquid chromatography affinity chromatography on Fbg-agarose (0.9 × 30 cm) was performed in 50 mm Hepes, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 μm d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (FPR-CH2Cl), and d-Phe-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. The samples of 2 ml were loaded, and chromatography was performed at 0.5 ml/min, monitored by the 280-nm absorbance. Native Gel Band Shift Experiments—Human Fbg was mixed with increasing concentrations of human or bovine SC-(1-325)·FPR-thrombin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 and incubated at room temperature for 15 min before adding sample buffer. Nondenaturing electrophoresis was performed with 6% polyacrylamide gels essentially following the standard Laemmli gel system but excluding SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol. Binding of Fbg to SC-(1-325)·[5F]FPR-ProT or SC-(1-325)·[OG]FPR-ProT Complex—The fluorescence changes of [OG]FPR-ProT or [5F]FPR-ProT in the presence of a slight molar excess of SC-(1-325) were measured in titrations with Fbg. 5Fluorescent analogs of ProT are represented as: [probe abbreviation]connecting thioester peptide chloromethyl ketone-ProT. The data were analyzed by fitting a binding equation containing an additional term for the linear dependence of the fluorescence amplitude on the SC-(1-325)-labeled ProT complex concentration to account for a nonspecific fluorescence change. The observed fluorescence change is given by Equation 1,ΔFFo=([PL]n[P]o)ΔFmaxFo+ΔFnsFo[PL] where PL is the SC-(1-325)-labeled ProT·Fbg complex, P is the SC-(1-325)-labeled ProT complex, and L is Fbg. The results were fit by the quadratic binding equation to solve for PL, with ΔFmax/Fo, ΔFns/Fo, KD, and n the fitted parameters. For Fbg binding to SC-(1-325)·[5F]FPR-ProT or [OG]FPR-ProT complexes, the nonspecific fluorescence increases (ΔFns/Fo) were 0.038 ± 0.011% nm-1 and 0.023 ± 0.012% nm, respectively. Molecular Modeling—Docking of the Fbg E5 fragment to the crystallographic (SC-(1-325)·Pre 2)2 heterotetramer was done manually with a modified E5 domain from bovine Fbg (Protein Data Bank (24Berman H.M.

After threading each HumAαAsp7-HumAαSer31 segment through the active site cleft of each cognate enzyme, the resulting pentamer was subjected to a few energy refinement cycles with CNS (cnc.csb.yale.edu/) to avoid severe steric clashes. The (SC-(1-325)·Pre 2)2·Fbg pentamer was constructed by optimally superimposing the central nodule of intact chicken Fbg (Protein Data Bank accession code 1JFE (11Yang Z. Kollman J.M. Pandi L.

Molecular Weights of SC-(1-325) and SC-(1-325)·Prethrombin 1 (Pre 1), Pre 2, and Thrombin Complexes—SC-(1-325) was monomeric in solution as determined by fast protein liquid chromatography in-line laser light scattering, with a molecular weight of 38,500, in agreement with the calculated value and the value determined by mass spectrometry of 37,942. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments showed that SC-(1-325) complexed with thrombin or Pre 2 at physiological ionic strength, and pH had apparent molecular weights of 86,000 ± 4,000, in agreement with formation of heterodimeric SC-(1-325)·(pre)thrombin complexes. Our previous finding that the SC-(1-325)·thrombin complex was tetrameric (3Friedrich R. Panizzi P. Fuentes-Prior P. Richter K. Verhamme I. Anderson P.J. Kawabata S. Huber R. Bode W. Bock P.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) was reproducibly obtained at low salt concentrations (20 mm KCl and below), where the apparent molecular weights increased considerably, indicating further, fully reversible aggregation to oligomers. Similar experiments performed with SC-(1-325) in the presence of Pre 2 showed similar salt-dependent self-association, but this was not observed for SC-(1-325)·Pre 1 complexes. Interactions of Staphylocoagulase-(1-325) with the Fbg Recognition Exosite—Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the crystallographically defined 1-281 sequence of SC from strain Tager 104, compared with sequences of SCs from different bacterial strains, which are representative of the distinct SC variants of S. aureus. In the SC-(1-325)·Pre 2 complex, each SC molecule consists of two independent, rod-like helical domains, D1 and D2 (3Friedrich R. Panizzi P. Fuentes-Prior P. Richter K. Verhamme I. Anderson P.J.

The three-helix bundle of D2 covers the basic anion binding exosite I located to the “east” of the thrombin active site. In this major interaction site, the 70-80 loop of thrombin grips into the groove formed by helices α2D2 and α3D2 and limited by the α1D1-α2Y loop, whereas helix α2D2 slots into the thrombin exosite groove (Fig. 2). Both moieties are primarily interconnected by a number of strong hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. For instance, the guanidyl group of the thrombin typical residue Arg73 frontally opposes the carboxylate of SCGlu46 (α1D1), whereas the Arg77A side chain is clamped between the SC carboxylate groups of the strictly conserved acidic residues, SCGlu213 and SCAsp217 (α2D2). The side chain of Arg75 faces the D1-D2 linker, donating a charged hydrogen bond to the main chain carbonyl of SCTyr48. To the periphery of this interface, additional highly conserved acidic SC side chains (e.g. SCGlu187, SCAsp198, and SCGlu228) also contribute to the strong electrostatic intermolecular interaction.FIGURE 2Interaction of SC-(1-325) with proexosite I of prethrombin 2. Proexosite I and its environment are shown as a solid surface, centered on the four thrombin-specific arginine residues Arg67, Arg73, Arg75, and Arg77A and colored according to the electrostatic surface potential calculated for the Pre 2 moiety alone (deep red, extremely negative; deep blue, extremely positive). The exosite I-contacting segments of SC-(1-325), formed basically by helices α2D2 and α3D2 of SC domain D2 and the α1D1-α2D1 loop of D1, are shown along with some color-coded acidic side chains (white, carbon atoms; red, oxygen atoms). Pre 2 is displayed in standard orientation (see accompanying paper (34Friedrich R. Panizzi P. Kawabata S. Bode W. Bock P.E. Fuentes-Prior P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 1188-1195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)). The figure was prepared using PYMOL (35DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System.

Surprisingly, SC domain D2 not only overlaps but turns out to bury a larger area of thrombin exosite I than the substrate Fbg (1,560 Å2 compared with <1,200 Å2). This finding implies that the clotting activity of SC-(1-325)·(pro)thrombin complexes does not rely on interactions of Fbg with this secondary binding exosite and prompted us to analyze in more detail the mechanism of Fbn generation by SC-bound (pro)thrombin. SC-(1-325)·(Pre)thrombin Complexes Crystallize as Symmetric Dimers—The SC-(1-325)·(pre)thrombin crystals contain two tightly interdigitating heterodimeric complexes/asymmetric unit (Fig. 3A). Both complexes can almost exactly be superimposed by a rotation of 180°, i.e. they are related by a virtually exact but crystallographically local 2-fold rotation axis. In this symmetric homodimer, the active sites of the two (pre)thrombin molecules face the central intermonomer space, with their active site Ser195 residues separated by about 75 Å. Upon complex dimerization, an elongated interface of 1,300 Å2 is removed from contact with bulk solvent. In its center, the α0D1-α1D1 turns (SCThr20 and SCLeu21) oppose each other to form a hydrophobic bridge (Fig. 3B). This bridge is, however, surrounded by a number of water molecules, which cross-connect polar groups from both monomers. Further, the C-terminal ends of helices α2D1 and the following α2D1-α3D1 segments protrude out of the helix bundles and form finger-like structures, each of which covers the N-terminal part of helix α1D1 from the neighboring monomer. These fingers carry a number of highly conserved aromatic residues (e.g. SCTyr81, SCTyr84, SCTyr88, and SCTyr108), which pack against the side chains of SCTrp25 and SCTyr26. Complex Assembly Among Met-SC-(1-325), ProT, and Fbg—In light of the SC-(1-325) blockade of exosite I and to address the mechanism of Fbg recognition by SC-(1-325)·(pro)thrombin complexes, we first examined interactions of ProT, Met-SC-(1-325), and Met-SC-(1-325)·ProT with Fbg by affinity chromatography on Fbg-agarose. ProT eluted in the void volume, indicating no detectable interaction (Fig. 4A), and Met-SC-(1-325) eluted in a trailing peak in the low ionic strength (0.05 m) equilibration buffer and fully at 4 m NaCl, suggestive of weak binding. Chromatography of an equimolar mixture of ProT and Met-SC-(1-325), in contrast, resulted in depletion of the free ProT and Met-SC-(1-325) peaks and appearance of a new Met-SC-(1-325)·ProT peak eluted with NaSCN (Fig. 4A). The results indicated that Met-SC-(1-325) bound to ProT and generated a Fbg-binding site not present on either of the individual components that mediated high affinity ternary complex formation. Band shift studies using native polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis were also performed to confirm Fbg binding by the SC-(1-325)·FPR-thrombin complexes and to give initial estimates of substrate to complex ratios. In these qualitative assays, no interaction was detected between free SC-(1-325) and Fbg, whereas the complex of SC-(1-325) and FPR-CH2Cl-substituted thrombin was band-shifted in the presence of both human (Fig. 4B) and bovine Fbg (not shown). Interestingly, a single Fbg molecule bound to two molecules of SC-(1-325)·FPR-thrombin, as indicated by the appearance of excess complex beyond a 2:1 SC-(1-325)·FPR-thrombin/Fbg ratio in Fig. 4B. Complex formation was not affected by Fbg deglycosylation (not shown). Because SC-(1-325) alone does not bind tightly to Fbg, and the two major binding sites on thrombin, namely the active site cleft and exosite I, are blocked in the SC-(1-325)·FPR-thrombin complex without impairing Fbg binding, we conclude that complex formation is essential for development of a Fbg-specific, high affinity binding site. In principle, this new binding site could be induced in either moiety upon complex formation. There are, however, no noticeable changes in SC-bound thrombin compared with other reported crystal structures, aside from those regions involved in direct contact with the cofactor. In this regard, SC binding results in only minor changes in thrombin specificity against small molecule substrates, including those corresponding to the cleavage site sequences for fibrinopeptides A and B (4Panizzi P.

To date, however, the structure of this 52-amino acid protein, by far the smallest lentiviral protein known, either in its mature form as free p6 or as the C-terminal part of the Pr55 Gag polyprotein has not been unraveled. We have explored the high resolution structure and folding of p6 by CD and NMR spectroscopy. Under membranous solution conditions, p6 can adopt a helix-flexible helix structure; a short helix-1 (amino acids 14–18) is connected to a pronounced helix-2 (amino acids 33–44) by a flexible hinge region. Thus, p6 can be subdivided into two distinct structural and functional domains; helix-2 perfectly defines the region that binds to the virus budding factor AIP-1/ALIX, indicating that this structure is required for interaction with the endosomal sorting complex required for transport. The PTAP motif at the N terminus, comprising the primary late assembly domain, which is crucial for interaction with another cellular budding factor, Tsg101, does not exhibit secondary structure. However, the adjacent helix-1 may play an indirect role in the specific complex formation between p6 and the binding groove in Tsg101.

The main structural components of retrovirus particles are synthesized as three polyproteins that produce either the virion interior (Gag), the viral enzymes (Pol), or the glycoproteins of the virion envelope (Env). The Gag polyprotein is required and sufficient for virus particle assembly and budding, although genomic RNA and envelope proteins are obligatory for production of infectious progeny virions. The processing of the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein Pr55 by the viral protease generates the matrix, capsid, nucleocapsid (NC), and p6 proteins. Matrix mediates the plasma membrane targeting of Gag and lines the inner shell of the mature virus particle, capsid forms the conical core shell encasing NC, and NC regulates packaging and condensation of the viral genome (1Pornillos O.

Although, the detailed molecular mechanism(s) of how the HIV-1 L-domain regulates virus budding remains elusive so far, it is now generally accepted that it functions as a docking site for the cellular budding apparatus that is normally involved in the endocytotic recycling of cell surface receptors (1Pornillos O. Garrus J.E. Sundquist W.I. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Two highly conserved motifs can be discerned in p6; the N-terminal P(T/S)AP motif forms the primary L-domain that mediates binding of Pr55 to the tumor susceptibility gene product (Tsg101), an E2-type ubiquitin ligase-like protein (9Göttlinger H.G.

Mechanistically, the interaction between Tsg101 and p6 is mediated by the N-terminal ubiquitin binding domain of Tsg101, designated as ubiquitin E2 variant sequence (UEV). The UEV binds to the PTAP motif of p6 in a process that appears to be up-regulated when upstream Lys residues in p6 are monoubiquitinylated (28Demirov D.G. Orenstein J.M. Freed E.O. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 29VerPlank L. Bouamr F. LaGrassa T.J. Agresta B. Kikonyogo A. Leis J. Carter C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

L-domains similar to the P(T/S)AP motif of HIV-1, such as PPXY or YXXL, have been identified in many other retroviruses and enveloped viruses (reviewed in Refs. 22Freed E.O. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4679-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar and 27Accola M.A. Strack B. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5395-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Another region of p6, residues 32–46, comprising the LXXLF motif necessary for Vpr binding and a cryptic YPXL-type L-domain, mediates the binding to AIP-1/ALIX, a class E vacuolar protein sorting factor that also interacts with Tsg101. AIP-1/ALIX also binds to late acting components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) and is necessary for the formation of multivesicular bodies at endosomal membranes (26Strack B. Calistri A. Craig S. Popova E. Göttlinger H.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 689-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Further, in more recent studies, VPS37B was identified as a new component of the ESCRT-I complex that binds to Tsg101. Together with Tsg101, it is incorporated into virions and, most astonishingly, is able to support budding of mutants of HIV-1 that are missing the PTAP L-domain (34Stuchell M.D. Garrus J.E. Muller B.

Since the process of multivesicular body formation can be envisioned as topologically similar to virus budding from the cell membrane, it is assumed that the complex formation between p6, Tsg101, and AIP-1/ALIX recruits components of the ESCRT system to the viral budding site (reviewed in Ref. 1Pornillos O. Garrus J.E. Sundquist W.I. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The current status of the molecular characterization of HIV-1 p6 is summarized in Fig. 1A. Among known lentiviruses, the 52-amino acid HIV-1 p6 protein is by far the smallest protein for which a molecular structure has not been defined hitherto. Thus, we have explored the high resolution structure and folding of p6 under various solution conditions using a combination of CD and NMR spectroscopy. We found that p6 adopts a helix-flexible helix structure; a short helix-1 (residues 14–18) is connected to a pronounced helix-2 (residues 33–44) by a flexible hinge region. We also found that helix-2 of p6, which comprises the LXXLF binding motif for Vpr, specifically interacts with Vpr. This indicates that p6 adopted a functional conformation under the specific solution conditions used for our NMR structure analysis. An overall model of the molecular structure of p6 is developed and discussed in the context of known functional modules of p6. Peptide Synthesis, Purification, and Characterization—Peptide synthesis were performed using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/t-butyl strategy on an Applied Biosystems automated Pioneer peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Darmstadt) using 0.5 g of TentaGel SAC Gln(Trt) resin (0.18 mmol/g; Rapp Polymere Tübingen), similar to a protocol described previously by us for the synthesis of the 96-residue HIV-1 regulator protein Vpr (35Bruns K. Fossen T. Wray V. Henklein P. Tessmer U. Schubert U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43188-43201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The following side chain protecting groups were used: 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofurane-5-sulfonyl (Arg), t-butoxycarbonyl (Trp and Lys), t-butyl ether (Thr, Ser, and Tyr), t-butyl ester (Asp and Glu), and trityl (Asn, Cys, Gln, and His). Couplings were performed with N-[1H-benzotriazol(1-yl)(dimethylamino)methylene]-N-methylmethanaminiumhexafluorophosphate-N-oxide using a 6-fold excess of amino acids. In order to increase the efficiency of the synthesis, double coupling steps were applied for positions 2, 3, 13, 50 (Ser), 51 (Gln), and 52 (Leu) beginning from the C terminus. A similar strategy was used for the shorter peptide fragments, synthetic p6 sp6-(1–21) and sp6-(23–52). Deprotection of the Fmoc group was performed during the complete synthesis with 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide. After cleavage from the resin with 95% trifluoroacetic acid in water containing 3% triisopropylsilane, the crude peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC using Vydac C18 protein column (40 × 300 mm, 1520 μ, 300 Å) with a linear gradient of 20% solution A to 70% solution B in 50 min (A, 1000 ml of water, 2 ml of trifluoroacetic acid; B, 500 ml of acetonitrile, 100 ml of water, 1 ml of trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 70 ml min–1 with spectrophotometric monitoring at λ = 220 nm. The fractions were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (Shimadzu L10) on a VYDAC C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μ, 300 Å) with a linear gradient of 10–100% solution B over 45 min and a linear H2O-acetonitrile gradient. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded at room temperature in 0.5-mm cuvettes on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter in a wavelength range from 260 to 180 nm, and the resulting curves were smoothed with a high frequency filter. Samples of full-length sp6-(1–52) and its related shorter fragments sp6-(1–21) and sp6-(23–52) were dissolved at a concentration of 0.2 mg ml–1 under various conditions (trifluoroethanol (TFE) concentration and pH). Phosphate-buffered solutions contained an appropriate mixture of 67 mm KH2PO4 + Na2HPO4 to give pH 7.2. Secondary structure content was quantified with the program VARSELEC (36Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). 1H NMR Spectroscopy—Samples of the peptides were dissolved in distilled water/TFE-d2 (1:1; v/v) to give a final volume of 0.7 ml. Spectra of sp6-(1–52) (9.7 mg dissolved in a mixture of 350 μl of H2O (super distilled) and 350 μl of TFE-d2) at pH 3 were recorded at 277, 290, 300, and 308 K, respectively, and similar spectra of sp6-(1–21) and sp6-(23–52) were recorded at 300 K at 600.133 MHz on a Bruker Avance DMX 600 NMR spectrometer. The 1H spectra were internally referenced to the residual methylene signal of TFE at 3.95 ppm. Two-dimensional phase-sensitive spectra of 1H COSY (correlation spectroscopy) were recorded with 512 free induction decays in t1 and 2000 data points in t2, and 64 (sp6-(1–52)) or 40 (sp6-(1–21) and sp6-(23–52)) transients were collected for each t1 increment. Spectra of two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) were recorded with mixing times of 110 ms. 800 free induction decays were recorded in t1 and 2048 data points in t2, and 32 (sp6-(1–52)) or 80 (sp6-(1–21) and sp6-(23–52)) transients were collected for each t1 increment. Spectra for two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) were recorded with mixing times of 250 ms. 800 free induction decays were recorded in t1 and 2048 data points in t2, and 32 (sp6-(1–52)) or 80 (sp6-(1–21) and sp6-(23–52)) transients were collected for each t1 increment. For all two-dimensional experiments, t1 was either zero-filled to 2048, or linear prediction was applied to 1024 and 1024 zero filling was used. Both t1 and t2 had final sizes of 2048. All two-dimensional experiments were recorded without spinning and processed with standard Bruker software. Binding Studies of sp6-(1–52) and sVpr-(26–33)—After recording one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra of sp6-(1–52), the same 50% TFE NMR sample as above was transferred to a new vial containing an equimolar amount of the peptide sVpr-(26–33) (LKSEAVRH), comprising the domain of the HIV-1NL4–3 Vpr that was shown previously to bind to p6. To prevent changes in the molarity of sp6-(1–52), the peptide sVpr-(26–33) was administered in dry, lyophilized form to the peptide solution. After complete dissolution of sVpr-(26–33), the solution was transferred back into the NMR sample tube, and identical NMR experiments were performed under exactly the same conditions as for sp6-(1–52) at 300 K. In a further experiment, a second equimolar amount of sVpr-(26–33) was added. All NMR experiments with homogenous sp6-(1–52) and heterogeneous sp6-(1–52) mixed with sVpr-(26–33) at ratios of 1:1 or 1:2 were performed under identical conditions. In these solutions, the p6 resonances were easily resolved from those of the sVpr-(26–33) peptide, which was also unambiguously assigned at both concentrations (see supplemental Fig. 2 and Table 6). Structure Calculations—The volumes of the integrated cross-peaks from the NOESY spectra of full-length sp6-(1–52) and sp6-(23–52) at 300 K were determined using the AURELIA program (37Neidig K.P. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 88: 155-160Google Scholar). The distances were calibrated against Gln side chain amide protons. After corrections for pseudoatoms, these values were used directly as distance restraints in molecular dynamics calculations. The structures were calculated on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station using the program CNS 1.0 (38Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16913) Google Scholar). For the structure calculations, standard CNS parameters for data sets based on NMR were applied. A total of 320 and 281 distance restraints for sp6-(1–52) and sp6-(23–52), respectively, in 50% TFE were used to generate 104 conformations for all procedures. In each case, 20 conformations that exhibited no restraint violations greater than 0.2 Å and had the lowest values of NOEs and total energies were used for the final fitting analysis. The heterogeneity within a final set of 20 structures was visualized using the consecutive segment approach, in which the r.m.s. differences of the backbone atoms for short segments 2–5 residues in length are systematically compared pairwise for all selected final structures (39Blankenfeldt W. Nokihara K. Naruse S. Lessel U. Schomburg D. Wray V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5955-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consequently, such a comparison provides an objective method for the recognition of stable structural elements in the ensemble of final structures and allows the regions to be defined for which alignments are made. The structure with the lowest energy was then determined using the programs LSQMAN and MOLEMAN2 (Uppsala Software Factory) (40Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Finally, alignments, using the regions defined by the consecutive segment approach, were performed, comparing all other structures with the lowest energy structure, and these were visualized with the BRAGI program (41Schomburg D. Reichelt J. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 161-165Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Generation of Anti-sp6-(1–52) Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies directed against full-length sp6-(1–52) (p6 antibodies) were generated by immunization of rabbits with sp6-(1–52), coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, administered in Titermac adjuvant. The resultant antiserum reacts with both sp6-(1–52), as well as with its viral counterpart, the p6 domain of HIV-1 Gag, either in its mature state as the free protein or as part of the Gag polyprotein Pr55 and processing intermediates thereof. SDS-PAGE, Western Blot, and Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation of sp6-(1–52) was carried out in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% digitonin, pH 7.4), precleared with nonimmune human and rabbit sera, followed by incubation with p6 antibodies preloaded onto GammaBind-Plus-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, once with SDS-DOC buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate), boiled for 10 min at 95 °C in sample buffer (2% SDS, 1% mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 65 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8), and subjected to electrophoresis on 10–16.5% gels. Discontinuous SDS-PAGE using Tris-Tricine cathode buffer was carried out as described by Schägger and von Jagow (42Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10407) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, samples were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with p6 antiserum, and binding of the antibodies was identified by ECL. Structure Prediction of the HIV-1 p6—Several methods for empirical structure prediction, which have been performed on the p6 sequence derived from the isolate HIV-1NL4–3, are summarized in TABLE ONE. All of our structure predictions and also those reported in previous literature (43Stys D. Blaha I. Strop P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) indicate that the main α-helical region is located at the C terminus. Earlier work based on prediction programs by Chou and Fasman (44Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) and by Garnier et al. (45Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar) tends to afford contradictory results in that either a highly structured protein or only a short 6-residue α-helical region at the C terminus was predicted, respectively (43Stys D. Blaha I. Strop P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More recent predictions of secondary structure of p6 (including ours) imply an α-helical region at the C terminus consisting of 6–8 residues, which always include residues Ala-39 to Leu-44 (TABLE ONE). In contrast, inconsistent results were calculated for the N terminus, although the two prediction methods nearest to our experimental NMR results to be reported below showed the presence of a short α-helix around residues Glu-12 to Ser-14 and a more extensive α-helix region that includes residues Leu-38 to Phe-45 (46Karplus K.

https://openalex.org/W2081782238,"The multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) mediates drug and organic anion efflux across the plasma membrane. The 17 transmembrane (TM) helices of MRP1 are linked by extracellular and cytoplasmic (CL) loops of various lengths and two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains. In this study, three basic residues clustered at the predicted TM15/CL7 interface were investigated for their role in MRP1 expression and activity. Thus, Arg1138, Lys1141, and Arg1142 were replaced with residues of the same or opposite charge, expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, and the properties of the mutant proteins were assessed. Neither Glu nor Lys substitutions of Arg1138 and Arg1142 affected MRP1 expression; however, all four mutants showed a decrease in organic anion transport with a relatively greater decrease in leukotriene C4 and glutathione transport. These mutations also modulated MRP1 ATPase activity as reflected by a decreased vanadate-induced trapping of 8-azido-[32P]ADP. Mutation of Lys1141 to either Glu or Arg reduced MRP1 expression, and routing to the plasma membrane was impaired. However, only the Glu-substituted Lys1141 mutant showed a decrease in organic anion transport, and this was associated with decreased substrate binding and vanadate-induced trapping of 8-azido-ADP. These studies identified a cluster of basic amino acids likely at the TM15/CL7 interface as a region important for both MRP1 expression and activity and demonstrated that each of the three residues plays a distinct role in the substrate specificity and catalytic activity of the transporter."

To investigate sequence determinants in the interaction between either of the two RNA polymerases and Pm, all possible single mutants between positions -7 and -18 were generated, and the activity in the exponential and stationary phases of the resulting mutant promoters was compared. The results precisely delimited a -10 element between positions -7 and -12 (TAGGCT), which defined a promoter sharing nucleotides with both σ38 and σ32 consensus. The first two and the last positions of this hexamer were crucial for recognition by both polymerases.

Western blots showed that σ32 was only detectable in the exponential phase, and σ38 appeared in the early stationary phase. In the rpoH mutant KY1429, σ38 was already present in the exponential growth phase both free and bound to the RNA polymerase core, in good correlation with the transcription levels found. Pm seems to be optimized for recognition by σ32 as an initial response to the addition of effector to the medium and allows binding of the adaptable σ38-dependent RNA polymerase in the stationary phase.

Genetic analyses established that XylS recognizes two 15-bp imperfect direct repeated motifs (5′-TGCAAPuAAPyGGNTA-3′) extending from -69 to -55 and from -48 to -34 in the Pm region (Fig. 1). Single point mutations in the binding site revealed that nucleotides located at -48 to -45 and at -58, -59, -61, and -69 are the most critical bases for appropriate XylS-Pm interactions (7Gallegos M.T.

The arrangement of the two motifs is such that the proximal XylS binding site overlaps by 1 bp the RNA polymerase binding site at -35 (11González-Pérez M.M. Marqués S. Domínguez-Cuevas P. Ramos J.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The Pm promoter seems to be a Class II promoter in which complex interactions occur between the RNA-polymerase and its cognate transcriptional regulator (12Busby S. Ebright R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro methylation assays of Pm show extensive methylation of T at position -41 in the bottom strand, suggesting the presence of a key distortion point that may favor XylS/RNA polymerase interactions (8González-Pérez M.M. Ramos J.L. Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2286-2290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this connection, it has been shown that XylS contacts residues 291 and 289 of the α-subunit of RNA polymerase (13Ruíz R. Ramos J.L. Egan S.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Pm promoter is unique in that in vivo transcription is mediated by RNA polymerase with different alternative σ factors. Transcription from the Pm promoter in the early exponential growth phase is mediated by RNA polymerase with σ32, but a switch to σ38 takes place in the late exponential and early stationary phases. Regardless of the growth phase, expression from Pm remains dependent on 3MB 3The abbreviations used are: 3MB3-methylbenzoateMUMiller units.3The abbreviations used are: 3MB3-methylbenzoateMUMiller units.-activated XylS, and the transcription initiation point is unchanged (14Marqués S.

The earliest evidence of the involvement of σ32 in Pm transcription came from the observation that, in an rpoH background, no expression of Pm took place in the exponential phase after induction, whereas expression increased during the stationary phase. Dependence on σ38 was supported by the reduced transcription from Pm in the stationary phase in an rpoS mutant (14Marqués S. Gallegos M.T. Ramos J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In an rpoH-rpoS double mutant, only basal activity from the Pm promoter was detected along the growth curve. Analyses of transcription using combinations of mutant Pm promoters and mutant XylS proteins confirmed that the alternative σ factors interacted directly with the Pm promoter (14Marqués S. Gallegos M.T. Ramos J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Ruíz R. Ramos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7282-7286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The increase in σ32 activity required for transcription in the exponential phase was provided through induction of the heat-shock response by the presence of the effector 3MB, which is also required for activation of the positive regulator XylS (17Marqués S. Manzanera M. Gonzélez-Pérez M.M. Ruiz R. Ramos J.L. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 103-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Microarray experiments with 3MB-induced P. putida (pWW0) cells further confirmed the fast (15 min) heat-shock response to this effector. 4P. Domínguez-Cuevas, J. E. González-Pastor, S. Marqués, J.

From these findings, it follows that the Pm promoter should be recognized by two different RNA polymerases, and therefore it should accommodate the essential elements for recognition by both σ38 and σ32 in the same sequence stretch, although they are recognized at different moments during growth. It is well established that σ factors play an essential role in programming gene expression, where the alternative σ subunits direct transcription toward specific gene sets according to growth and environmental conditions. The set of σ factors that forms the σ70 family shares regions of extensive sequence homology and is organized in similar domains and subdomains. However, the DNA sequence recognized by the holoenzyme bearing each of the subunits is different. A number of σ38-dependent promoters have been analyzed in an attempt to derive a consensus sequence. No clear -35 sequence has been defined, but the -10 region exhibits distinctive features (i.e. a C at position -7 in the -10 hexamer and CT at positions -13/-12). The region downstream from the -10 sequence in σ38-recognized promoters is rich in adenines and thymines (18Espinosa-Urgel M. Chamizo C. Tormo A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Gaal T. Ross W. Estrem S.T. Nguyen L.H. Burgess R.R. Gourse R.L. Mol.

On the other hand, a consensus sequence for σ32-dependent promoters has been defined from the compilation of 18 Escherichia coli heat-shock promoters (22Gross C. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. II I Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanic B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaecter M. Umbarger H.E. Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1996: 1382-1399Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). As far as we know, none of these eighteen promoters required specific transcriptional activators, but heat-shock stabilization of σ32 was the only requirement for activation in E. coli. In this study, we analyzed the Pm promoter sequence to decipher the critical features that allow its unique response to RNA polymerases with either σ32 or σ38. We first precisely defined the -10 hexamer from mutant phenotypes, and we showed that, depending on the σ factor used by the RNA polymerase and despite the sole transcription start point, there are two different overlapping promoters at Pm. Our analyses made it possible to identify promoter bases that are critical for either one or both σ factors. We also analyzed the role and influence of relative σ factor abundance on Pm activity. A model on the functioning of Pm is proposed based on the analysis of the mutant promoters determined in this study. Bacterial Strains, Culture Media, and Plasmids—The strains used are listed in TABLE ONE. E. coli MC4100, RH90, KY1429, and SM25 were grown at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented, when required, with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, or 10 μg/ml tetracycline. Growth was determined turbidometrically at 660 nm.

Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2005; (John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York)Google Scholar) or to the manufacturer's recommendations. Construction of Mutant Pm Promoters—The Pm mutant promoters were generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis as described previously (25Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The internal oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis exhibited one mismatch with respect to the wild-type sequence. The external oligonucleotides were the so-called M13 reverse primer (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′) or a universal primer (5′-GTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG-3′). The template for each mutagenesis was 200 ng of pJLR100, and amplification conditions were as described by Higushi (26Higushi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. A Guide to Methods and Applications. 1990: 177-183Google Scholar). After DNA amplification, the resulting DNA was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and the 401-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragments containing mutant Pm sequences were inserted between the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pMD1405 to yield plasmids pMD::Pmx-zy, which carry in-frame Pm*::lacZ fusions, where x is the original base in Pm, located at position -z with respect to the transcription start site and mutated to y. All of the mutant Pm promoter sequences generated in this study were confirmed by DNA sequencing. RNA Extraction and Analysis—Culture samples of 15 ml were harvested by centrifugation in disposable plastic tubes pre-cooled in liquid N2 and were kept at -80 °C until use. RNA was extracted using the TRI Reagent® from Molecular Research Center (Madrid, Spain) and modified as follows. The lysis step was carried out at 60 °C, and a final digestion step with RNase-free DNase was added at the end of the process. The RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Hybridization of the single-stranded 32P end-labeled DNA primer XylX (5′-GGGTCGGTGAACATCTCGCGCTTGC-3′) (105 cpm/assay) complementary to the mRNA transcript originated from Pm and primer extension with avian myoblastasis virus reverse transcriptase were carried out as described previously (27Manzanera M. Aranda-Olmedo I. Ramos J.L. Marques S. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1323-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In all assays, 10 μg of total RNA was used as a template. cDNA products were analyzed in a urea-polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and gels were exposed to a phosphor screen (Fuji Photo Film Co, Ltd.) for 24-48 h. Phosphor screens were scanned using a phosphorimaging instrument (Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad). Data were quantified with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). β-Galactosidase Assays—E. coli strains bearing the wild-type Pm::lacZ or mutant Pm*::lacZ fusions in pMD1405 plus a compatible plasmid bearing the wild-type XylS (pERD103, TABLE ONE) were grown overnight on LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics. Three independent clones of each strain were used. Duplicate cultures were prepared by diluting cells from overnight cultures to 1/100. After 1 h at 30 °C, one of the duplicates was supplemented with 1 mm 3MB, while the other one was kept as an uninduced control. Samples for β-galactosidase activity assays in the exponential phase were taken 30 min after induction when cultures had reached an OD660 = 0.1-0.3. Five hours after induction, the cultures had reached the stationary phase (OD660 = 2-2.5), and samples for β-galactosidase activity were taken as above. β-Galactosidase activity was determined in permeabilized whole cells according to Miller (28Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. 1972; (pp. , Cold Spring Harbor, New York): 352-355Google Scholar). Plasmid Copy Number—The plasmid copy number in different strains was compared by determining plasmid molecule:chromosome molecule ratio using real-time PCR (29Tao L. Jackson R.E. Cheng Q. Metab. Eng. 2005; 7: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The bla gene and the rpoD gene were used as the plasmid and chromosomal marker, respectively. PCR primers 5′-CGAGCGTGACACCACGATG-3′ and 5′-GCGCAGAAGTGGTCCTG-3′ were used to amplify the bla gene, and 5′-GATGGCGATGACGACAGC-3′ and 5′-GCGTGACTGCGACCTTTC-3′ were used to amplify the rpoD gene. E. coli MC4100, RH90, and KY1429 bearing wild-type Pm::lacZ fusion in pMD1405 plus a compatible plasmid bearing the wild-type XylS (pERD103, TABLE ONE) were cultured as for β-galactosidase assays (see previous paragraph), and samples were taken in exponential and stationary phases. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of distilled water, cells were lysed by sonication, and the crude lysate was spun for 2 min at 12,000 × g. Supernatant aliquots of 100 μl were heated at 99 °C for 10 min to inactivate DNases. Four serial dilutions were prepared for each crude DNA sample. Real-time PCR was performed on an iCycler iQ detection system instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR reaction (20 μl) was set up using the following reagents: 10 μl of 2× SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 0.2 μl each of the forward and reverse primers for each gene (100 μm), 7.6 μl of water, and 2 μl of diluted DNA sample. The thermal cycling conditions used were: 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. A final melt curve was carried out to check the specific amplification of both genes. All reactions were run in triplicate. For each strain and condition, the two genes were analyzed. Western Blots—Overnight cultures of E. coli strains were grown on LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics. Cultures were diluted 100-fold in the same medium, grown for 1 h at 30°C and then supplemented or not with 1 mm 3MB. After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the cells (100 ml) were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended and washed once in 1× M9 buffer (48 mm sodium phosphate, 22 mm potassium phosphate, 19 mm ammonium chloride, and 8.5 mm sodium chloride, pH 7). The resulting paste was stored at -20 °C until use. The same procedure was followed in parallel cultures after 5 h of induction, except that 10-ml samples were harvested. The cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer containing Tris (50 mm) pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed by sonication, and the insoluble fraction was discarded by centrifugation at 18 000 × g for 20 min. Care was taken to process all samples in parallel to avoid differences in protein dissociation. Aliquot fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (12.5%) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. To determine the relative fraction of each σ factor bound to the RNA polymerase core, the same samples were run in native 7% (w/v) PAGE and transferred as described above. The membranes were blocked for 3 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline. Blots were incubated at 4 °C overnight with monoclonal antibodies against each E. coli σ subunit (purchased from Neoclone). Antibodies were diluted 1:3000 in the case of σ70, σ38, and β antibodies and 1:1000 for σ32 antibodies. Blots were washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution and incubated with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G + L conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h (Caltag Laboratories). The blots were developed with the SuperSignal® West Dura-extended duration substrate (Pierce). Chemiluminescent blots were exposed to auto-radiographic film for 30 s to 2 min. Time course experiments were carried out as described above, except that samples for extract preparation were taken 10, 30 and 60 min and 5 h after 3MB was added. Pm Transcription and Levels of the Different σ Factors along the Growth Curve—σ factors bind to core RNA polymerase and allow the recognition of short nucleotide motifs located 10 and 35 bp upstream from the transcription start point of the promoters. Depending on the σ factor and the promoter, the so-called -10 box can be located at different positions between -5 and -14. In the Pm promoter, these sequences diverged considerably from consensus ones (Fig. 1). In this promoter, high expression levels were maintained throughout the growth curve by a switch from Eσ32 in the exponential phase to Eσ38 in the stationary phase. As a result, no significant decrease in activity was observed during growth, reflecting optimized coupling of the two RNA polymerases. The limits defining Pm transcription by each RNA polymerase can only be defined in σ mutant backgrounds. In our analysis, we used E. coli MC4100 as the wild-type strain and its isogenic derivatives RH90 (rpoS mutant) (30Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and KY1429 (rpoH mutant) (31Zhou Y.N. Kusukawa N. Erickson J.W. Gross C.A. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3640-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is known that the promoter sequence is not the only factor that determines in vivo promoter selectivity by different RNA polymerases. Parameters, such as σ factor levels and availability or σ factor competition for the polymerase core, also play important roles (32Ishihama A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). To pinpoint the conditions when the switch between σ factors occurred in the Pm promoter, it became necessary to determine their relative abundance in the wild-type and σ-deficient backgrounds under different growth conditions. To track the presence of factors σ38, σ32, and σ70 in cells growing on LB medium in the presence or absence of 3MB, samples for Western blot analysis were taken in the early exponential or stationary phase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Similar levels of σ70 were found in all three strains in both the exponential and stationary phases. These levels were independent of the presence or absence of 3MB (not shown). In the exponential phase, σ38 was only detectable in KY1429 (Fig. 2A). In the stationary phase, σ38 was detectable in the parental strain MC4100 and in the rpoH mutant KY1429, whereas it was absent in the rpoS mutant RH90 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, σ38 stability was low in KY1429, as denoted by the multiple degradation bands that appeared in Western blots, particularly in the stationary phase. In this strain, in the presence of 3MB, σ38 concentration greatly increased both in the exponential and stationary phases (Fig. 2, A and B). This could be due to impairment of the heat-shock response in the rpoH strain and, hence, to reduced induction of heat-shock proteins, such as ClpXP and DnaK (33Muffler A. Barth M. Marschall C. Hengge-Aronis R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 445-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zhou Y. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1154-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are responsible for the degradation and stability, respectively, of σ38. To detect σ32, doubled amounts of total protein were loaded into the gels. In the wild-type and rpoS mutant, σ32 was detectable only in the exponential phase, regardless of the presence of 3MB, and was absent in the knock-out mutant KY1429 (Fig. 2C). The time course of the appearance of σ38 in response to the addition of 3MB was followed along a growth curve (Fig. 2D). In the wild-type strain, where σ38 was absent in the exponential phase, the σ factor appeared 1 h after the addition of 3MB. In KY1429, σ38 was detected as promptly as 10 min after induction. Heat-shock or stress induction of σ38 in the exponential phase has been reported, and unlike σ32, this response is not transient (33Muffler A. Barth M. Marschall C. Hengge-Aronis R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 445-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to estimate changes in the fraction of each σ factor bound to the RNA polymerase core under our experimental conditions, samples from all three strains were taken in the exponential and stationary phases from cells grown in the presence and absence of 3MB, electrophoresed under nondenaturing (native) conditions, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes in quadruplicate. The membranes were then incubated with antibodies against the β, σ70, σ38,or σ32 subunits of RNA polymerase (Fig. 3). Free subunits and RNA polymerase holoenzymes could be identified when membranes incubated with antibodies against β and σ70 subunits were compared. Fig. 3, A and B, shows a slow migrating band that could be detected with antibodies against σ70 and β and was thus identified as the holoenzyme. It is interesting to note that, in the exponential phase, a portion of the β subunit was found as a free subunit, whereas in the stationary phase, most of it appeared bound to the core. In contrast, σ70 factor was mainly found as part of the holoenzyme. Incubation with antibodies against σ38 revealed two bands, one corresponding to free σ38 and a second one migrating slowly (as described for the holoenzyme band) and thus corresponding to core-bound σ38. The data shown in Fig. 3C confirmed that σ38 was most abundant in KY1429 as a free subunit and also as part of the holoenzyme. In this strain, the addition of 3MB increased the fraction of σ38 bound to the core. In the stationary phase, this σ factor was mostly found as a free subunit based on our analysis of Western blots. Our experimental conditions did not allow the detection of σ32 in the native electrophoresis. These results indicate a clear-cut difference between σ32 and σ38 in MC4100 in the exponential and stationary phases. In the rpoH mutant KY1429, σ38 appears to become available earlier during growth, both free and as part of the holoenzyme. As a consequence, Eσ38 would be able to transcribe Pm earlier during the growth period than in the wild-type strain MC4100 (see “Expression from Pm in an σ32-deficient Background”). Scanning Mutagenesis of the RNA Polymerase Binding Region at Pm— To identify the critical nucleotides able to confer specific recognition of Pm by either σ32 or σ38, we generated all possible single point mutations between positions -7 and -18. The region under analysis was extended to -18, because the Pm sequence resembles the σ32 consensus sequence between positions -14 and -17 (CCCC) (35Gr"
https://openalex.org/W2059239475,"Staphylocoagulase (SC) is a potent nonproteolytic prothrombin (ProT) activator and the prototype of a newly established zymogen activator and adhesion protein family. The staphylocoagulase fragment containing residues 1-325 (SC-(1-325)) represents a new type of nonproteolytic activator with a unique fold consisting of two three-helix bundle domains. The N-terminal, domain 1 of SC (D1, residues 1-146) interacts with the 148 loop of thrombin and prethrombin 2 and the south rim of the catalytic site, whereas domain 2 of SC (D2, residues 147-325) occupies (pro)exosite I, the fibrinogen (Fbg) recognition exosite. Reversible conformational activation of ProT by SC-(1-325) was used to create novel analogs of ProT covalently labeled at the catalytic site with fluorescence probes. Analogs selected from screening 10 such derivatives were used to characterize quantitatively equilibrium binding of SC-(1-325) to ProT, competitive binding with native ProT, and SC domain interactions. The results support the conclusion that SC-(1-325) binds to a single site on fluorescein-labeled and native ProT with indistinguishable dissociation constants of 17-72 pm. The results obtained for isolated SC domains indicate that D2 binds ProT with ∼130-fold greater affinity than D1, yet D1 binding accounts for the majority of the fluorescence enhancement that accompanies SC-(1-325) binding. The SC-(1-325)·(pro)thrombin complexes and free thrombin showed little difference in substrate specificity for tripeptide substrates or with their natural substrate, Fbg. Lack of a significant effect of blockage of (pro)exosite I of (pro)thrombin by SC-(1-325) on Fbg cleavage indicates that a new Fbg substrate recognition exosite is expressed on the SC-(1-325)·(pro)thrombin complexes. Our results provide new insight into the mechanism that mediates zymogen activation by this prototypical bacterial activator. Staphylocoagulase (SC) is a potent nonproteolytic prothrombin (ProT) activator and the prototype of a newly established zymogen activator and adhesion protein family. The staphylocoagulase fragment containing residues 1-325 (SC-(1-325)) represents a new type of nonproteolytic activator with a unique fold consisting of two three-helix bundle domains. The N-terminal, domain 1 of SC (D1, residues 1-146) interacts with the 148 loop of thrombin and prethrombin 2 and the south rim of the catalytic site, whereas domain 2 of SC (D2, residues 147-325) occupies (pro)exosite I, the fibrinogen (Fbg) recognition exosite. Reversible conformational activation of ProT by SC-(1-325) was used to create novel analogs of ProT covalently labeled at the catalytic site with fluorescence probes.

The N terminus of SC is bound to the “Ile16 pocket” (chymotrypsinogen numbering) of Pre 2, presenting Ile1-Val2 number-residues of SC to Asp194 of Pre 2 and resulting in formation of the salt bridge necessary for proper serine proteinase folding and catalytic activity. SC-(1-325) is a boomerang-shaped molecule that consists primarily of two three-helix bundle domains. The N-terminal domain (D1) of SC-(1-325) interacts with the 148 loop of Pre 2, positioning the N terminus for insertion into the Ile16 pocket, whereas the second domain (D2) binds to (pro)exosite I on thrombin, Pre 2, and ProT (1Friedrich R.

Because SC·(pro)thrombin complexes cleave Fbg specifically with D2 of SC occupying (pro)exosite I, Fbg substrate recognition must occur through a different site. A detailed structural analysis of the interfaces of D1 and D2 of SC-(1-325) with ProT and prediction of the mode of Fbg recognition by the SC-(1-325)·(pre)thrombin complexes are presented in the accompanying paper (29Panizzi P. Friedrich R. Fuentes-Prior P. Richter K. Bock P.E. Bode W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To quantitate binding of SC-(1-325) to ProT and binding of Fbg (29Panizzi P. Friedrich R. Fuentes-Prior P. Richter K. Bock P.E. Bode W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we developed novel active site-labeled fluorescent analogs of the ProT zymogen as probes of the interactions. 5Fluorescent analogs of ProT are represented by: [probe abbreviation]connecting thioester peptide chloromethyl ketone-ProT. 5Fluorescent analogs of ProT are represented by: [probe abbreviation]connecting thioester peptide chloromethyl ketone-ProT. The analogs are based on the reversibility of SC-induced ProT activation, which allows irreversible inactivation of the catalytic site of the zymogen by hemiketal formation with Ser195 and alkylation of His57 with the inhibitor Nα-[(acetylthio-)acetyl]-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (ATA-FPR-CH2Cl), followed by specific attachment of various probes, and separation of the fluorescent zymogen derivatives from SC-(1-325). Equilibrium binding of SC-(1-325) to ProT was characterized for the first time by the use of fluorescent ProT analogs selected by screening a panel of 10 derivatives for reporters of the interaction. Our results demonstrate that SC-(1-325) binds to active site-labeled ProT analogs and native ProT with a 1:1 stoichiometry and extremely high affinity (KD = 17-72 pm). SC-(1-325)·ProT complexes formed with native ProT were cleaved slowly at both thrombin-sensitive sites, Arg155-Ser156 and Arg284-Thr285, generating prethrombin 1 (Pre 1) and fragment 1 and generating Pre 2′ and fragment 2, respectively. D1 binding to labeled ProT accounted primarily for the fluorescence enhancement observed upon SC-(1-325) binding, whereas the affinity of the isolated D2 for ProT was ∼130-fold greater than that of D1. SC-(1-325) complexes with thrombin and ProT exhibited equivalent Fbg clotting activities, only small differences in specificity for tripeptide chromogenic substrates compared with free thrombin, and no preference for the sequences preceding the cleavage sites for release of fibrinopeptides A and B. The blockage of exosite I-dependent Fbg clotting activity by SC-(1-325) and the small changes in tripeptide substrate specificity suggest that Fbg recognition is mediated by an exosite on the complex. Further studies of the Fbg interaction are presented in the companion paper (29Panizzi P. Friedrich R. Fuentes-Prior P. Richter K. Bock P.E. Bode W. J. Biol.

Met-SC-(1-325) fused to a C-terminal His6 tag (Met-SC-(1-325)-His6) was prepared by deleting a stop codon, which allowed translation of additional Lys-Leu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Leu-Glu-His6 residues. Met-SC-(1-325)-His6 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) plysS. The cells were grown to an optical density of 0.4-0.6 at 600 nm and induced by the addition of 500 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were induced for 4-6 h and lysed by three rounds of consecutive freeze-thaw cycles or sonication, and Met-SC-(1-325)-His6 was purified from the soluble fraction after centrifugation, by Ni2+-iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose chromatography. Met-SC-(1-325)-His6 activated ProT, as measured by H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide assay, with comparable activity as determined previously for Met-SC-(1-325) (1Friedrich R. Panizzi P.

Met-SC-(1-325)-His6 was used instead of Met-SC-(1-325) in ProT labeling to facilitate separation of the activator and labeled zymogen. Preparation of Active Site-labeled ProT Analogs—The thrombin-selective thioester-peptide chloromethyl ketone, ATA-FPR-CH2Cl, was prepared as described previously (30Bock P.E. J. Biol.

The Met-SC-(1-325)·ProT complex was inactivated by adding 145-200 μm ATA-FPR-CH2Cl to 45-60 μm ProT in 50 mm Hepes, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4 buffer (Buffer A) at 25 °C. Inhibition reactions were initiated by the addition of 90-120 μm Met-SC-(1-325) and were monitored by the decrease in the rate of hydrolysis of H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA. The reactions were typically complete (<0.1% activity) within 1 h. To ensure complete inhibition, 200 μm FPR-CH2Cl was added. Excess inhibitor was removed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography in 0.1 m Hepes, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0 buffer. Met-SC-(1-325)·ATA-FPR-ProT (10-25 μm) was labeled by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of the desired thiol-reactive probe derivative and subsequent addition of 0.1 m NH2OH, followed by incubation for 1-2 h in the dark at 25 °C. Excess label was removed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography. Met-SC-(1-325)-labeled ProT complex was concentrated and dissociated by dialysis against Buffer A with 3 m NaSCN but without polyethylene glycol 8000. The dissociated proteins were separated by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration chromatography on 2-3 tandem Superdex 200 HR 10/30 columns equilibrated with the same buffer. Fractions containing the first of two overlapping peaks, consisting primarily of labeled ProT, were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.4 (Buffer B). The pooled protein was rechromatographed on Superdex 200 HR 10/30 in Buffer B under the same conditions. Fractions containing the second of two peaks, consisting of labeled ProT, were pooled, quick-frozen, and stored at -70 °C. A second, improved method was subsequently used for separation of labeled ProT from the Met-SC-(1-325)-labeled ProT complex using Met-SC-(1-325)-His6. The Met-SC-(1-325)-His6·ProT complex was formed, inactivated, and labeled, and excess probe was removed as described above. Met-SC-(1-325)-His6·labeled ProT was chromatographed on Ni2+-iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose in Buffer B. Labeled ProT was step-eluted with 3 m NaSCN, and the majority of Met-SC-(1-325)-His6 was eluted with a gradient of imidazole up to 500 mm. Trace amounts of Met-SC-(1-325)-His6-labeled ProT complex were removed by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration on Superdex 200 HR 10/30 in Buffer B. Two peaks corresponding to Met-SC-(1-325)-His6-labeled ProT complex and free labeled ProT were eluted, and the labeled analog was pooled, dialyzed against Buffer B, quick-frozen, and stored at -70 °C. Characterization of Labeled ProT—The stoichiometry of fluorescence probe incorporation into ProT for 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein (5F), 2-((4′-iodoacetamido)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (ANS), and Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide or 5-(and 6)-iodoacetamido-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein (OG) was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm and the corresponding probe absorbance in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 m guanidine, pH 8.5. For 5F-labeled ProT, 84,000 m-1 cm-1 at 498 nm and an absorbance ratio A280 nm/A498 nm of 0.19 were used (36Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. Labanowski J.K. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26088-26095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Incorporation of ANS was measured using 26,000 m-1 cm-1 at 328 nm and A280 nm/A328 nm of 0.78 (30Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14963-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of OG was measured using 55,800 m-1 cm-1 at 491 nm and A280 nm/A491 nm of 0.29 (37Boxrud P.D. Fay W.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The concentration of residual active ProT was determined by chromogenic substrate assay of 25 nm labeled ProT after incubation with a 5-fold excess of SC-(1-325) for 20 min at 25 °C, relative to a known concentration of the native SC-(1-325)·ProT complex. Fluorescence Studies—Fluorescence was measured with an SLM 8100 fluorometer, in acrylic cuvettes coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000. All of the experiments were performed in Buffer A at 25 °C. Corrections for background were made from parallel measurements on blanks lacking the labeled species. Binding of SC-(1-325) (or when applicable isolated SC domains) to various labeled ProT analogs was measured in titrations of labeled ProT monitoring the change in fluorescence at probe emission wavelengths (nm) of ProT labeled with: dansylaziridine (DAN), 506; ANS, 438; 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (ACR), 502; 6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethyl-aminonaphthalene (BAD), 510; AF350 (the sulfonated coumarin derivative called AlexaFluor 350 C5 maleimide), 436; BODIPY® 507/545 iodoacetamide or N-(4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-2-yl)iodoacetamide (BD), 535; tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide dihydroiodide (TMR), 580; 4′-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein (4′F), 521; and 5F and OG, 520. The probes were excited at wavelengths (nm): DAN, 343; ANS, 335; ACR, 398; BAD, 400; AF350, 352; BD, 506; TMR, 550; and 4′F, 5F, and OG, 490. The fluorescence changes measured as a function of total SC-(1-325) concentration and expressed as (Fobs - Fo)/Fo = ΔF/Fo were fit by the quadratic binding equation to obtain the maximum fluorescence change ((Fmax - Fo)/Fo = ΔFmax/Fo), the dissociation constant (KD), and the stoichiometric factor (n). Nonlinear least squares fitting was performed with SCIENTIST software (MicroMath). The error estimates represent ± 2 S.D. [OG]FPR-ProT Fluorescence Emission Spectra—[OG]FPR-ProT was excited at 490 nm in the absence and presence of 500 nm SC-(1-325), 8 μm D1, and 8 μm D2, and the spectra were collected (8-nm band pass) in 1 nm steps with two consecutive scans averaged. Emission spectra of D1 binding to [OG]FPR-ProT were recorded at D1 concentrations of 0.5, 1.6, 3.8, 5.6, and 8 μm. Proteolytic Cleavage of ProT in the Presence of SC-(1-325)—To characterize cleavage of the SC-(1-325)·ProT complex, mixtures of 2 μm [OG]FPR-ProT and 0.05-12 μm SC-(1-325) were incubated for 18 h in the dark at 25 °C in the presence of 10 μm FPR-CH2Cl. Similar reactions were performed in the presence of 2 μm native ProT without inhibitor and in the presence of 100 μm FPR-CH2Cl and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). The cleavage products were identified by SDS gel electrophoresis in comparison with purified ProT fragments. The gels were stained for protein with GelCode Blue (Pierce), and fluorescence was visualized with a 300-nm transilluminator. Competitive Binding of SC-(1-325) to Native ProT and [OG]FPR-ProT—The effect of native ProT on SC-(1-325) binding to 0.12 nm [OG]FPR-ProT was measured in titrations with native ProT, at fixed concentrations of SC-(1-325) (0.5, 5, and 10 nm). The fluorescence changes for individual reactions were calculated from 30-40-min time course measurements for a reaction blank, [OG]FPR-ProT alone, and mixtures of [OG]FPR-ProT and native ProT after the addition of SC-(1-325). Together with the direct titration data of [OG]FPR-ProT with SC-(1-325), the data were fit simultaneously by the cubic equation for tight competitive binding of SC-(1-325) to labeled and native ProT to determine the dissociation constant and stoichiometry for the native SC-(1-325)·ProT interaction (38Lindahl P.

The ASIC3 subunit is largely expressed in the peripheral nervous system, where it contributes to pain perception and to some aspects of mechanosensation. We report here a PDZ-dependent and protein kinase C-modulated association between ASIC3 and the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1) adaptor protein. We show that NHERF-1 and ASIC3 are co-expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons. NHERF-1 enhances the ASIC3 peak current in heterologous cells, including F-11 dorsal root ganglion cells, by increasing the amount of channel at the plasma membrane. Perhaps more importantly, we show that the plateau current of ASIC3 can be dramatically increased (10-30-fold) by association with NHERF-1, leading to a significant sustained current at pH 6.6. In the presence of NHERF-1, the ASIC3 subcellular localization is modified, and the channel co-localizes with ezrin, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin family of actin-binding proteins, providing the first direct link between ASIC3 and the cortical cytoskeleton.

The ASIC family comprises six isoforms encoded by four different genes and expressed in sensory and/or central neurons (6Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. De Weille J.R. Heurteaux C.

Functional ASICs are homomeric or heteromeric channels, probably tetramers, with different kinetics, external pH sensitivities, and tissue distribution (6Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E.

ASIC subunits have two transmembrane domains flanking a large extracellular cysteine-rich region. Both NH2 and COOH termini are therefore intracytoplasmic and might interact with other proteins involved, for instance, in the localization and the regulation of these channels. PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95 protein)/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-containing proteins interacting with the COOH terminus of ASIC3 and able to modulate the H+-gated current have recently been identified. The first one was the scaffolding protein, CIPP (channel-interacting PDZ domain protein), which contains four PDZ domains and increases ASIC3 current density (18Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16655-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PSD-95 and Lin-7b proteins also modulate ASIC3 levels in the plasma membrane (19Hruska-Hageman A.M. Benson C.J. Leonard A.S. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase-1) participates in the protein kinase C (PKC) regulation of ASIC3 through its PDZ-dependent association with the ASIC2b subunit (20Deval E. Salinas M. Baron A. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19531-19539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which itself can form a heteromeric channel with ASIC3. The integral membrane protein stomatin has also been shown to associate with ASIC3, as well as with ASIC1a and ASIC2a, and to alter the gating properties of ASIC2a and ASIC3 without altering channel surface expression (21Price M.P.

This paper describes the adaptor protein NHERF-1 (Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1) as an accessory protein that teams up with ASIC3 to provide a new type of modulation of its function and of its subcellular localization in relation with the cytoskeleton. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—An ASIC3 COOH-terminal bait corresponding to the last 68 amino acids of rat ASIC3 was used to screen a rat DRG cDNA library as previously described (18Anzai N. Deval E.

For subsequent analysis, the full-length rat NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 cDNAs, encoding the 356- and 337-amino acid proteins, respectively, as well as the mutated forms of both ASIC3 and NHERFs were obtained by PCR (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6812) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with rat HA-NHERF-1 or HA-NHERF-2 (NH2-terminal HA tag), rat Myc-ASIC3 (NH2-terminal Myc tag), or both, by the DEAE-dextran method. F-11 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were scrapped in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and Roche Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) 24-48 h post-transfection and then centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. For phosphorylation experiments, cells were treated for 20 min with a 100 nm concentration of the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or with a 10 μm concentration of the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (Sigma) before lysis. Supernatant was collected and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA 3F10 antibody (Roche Applied Science), anti-Myc A14 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-NHERF-1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents). After incubation with protein A or protein G affinity gel (Sigma), beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS-PAGE buffer for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated or cell lysate proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.). Membranes were blotted with the 3F10 (1:1,000), A14 (1:500), anti-NHERF-1 (1:800), or anti-NHERF-2 (1:1,000) antibody for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Peroxidase-conjugated (for chemiluminescence revelation; 1:10,000) or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated (for fluorescence revelation; 1:10,000) secondary antibodies were used. Blots were revealed with the supersignal WestPico luminescent detection system (Pierce) or with ECF substrate (Amersham Biosciences) followed by fluorescence scanning using a 570-nm filter in a ProXpress system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Freshly isolated mouse dorsal root ganglia were homogenized on ice with a Dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer and then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C before centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. Western blots were performed as previously described. Surface Biotinylation in COS-7 Cells—Surface biotinylation experiments were carried out according to standard protocols. Briefly, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method and used 48 h post-transfection. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-Biotin reagent (Pierce) dissolved in PBS (pH 8.0) and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS complemented with 100 mm glycine and incubated for 20 min in the same buffer on ice. Cell lysis was performed as previously described for the immunoprecipitation experiments. After the 100,000 × g centrifugation step, supernatant was mixed with 30-50 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and then heated in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 20 min at 65 °C. Proteins were next resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and subsequent steps (transfer and Western blot analysis) were carried out as described previously. Immunofluorescence and in Situ Hybridization—COS-7 cells were grown on 35-mm plates and transfected by the DEAE-dextran method. The next day, cells were dissociated with 1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates. One day later, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% horse serum, and incubated with primary antibodies anti-Myc A14 (1:800) or 9E10 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-HA 3F10 (1:2,000), or anti-ezrin (1:700; gift of Dr. M. Arpin), followed by the secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:1,500), donkey anti-rat Alexa 594 (1:1,500), or donkey anti-mouse Alexa 594 (1:1,500) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Staining was visualized using an Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss). In situ hybridization was essentially performed as previously described (10Voilley N. de Weille J. Mamet J. Lazdunski M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol.

For fluorescent labeling, detection was performed with the ELF-97 mRNA in situ hybridization kit (Molecular Probes) based on the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase interaction with the biotinylated probe and the formation of green fluorescent precipitates in the presence of the ELF-97 substrate. Detection of the NHERF-1 protein by immunohistochemistry was performed after the in situ hybridization with an anti-NHERF-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:200; Affinity Bioreagents) followed by a goat anti-rabbit Texas Red secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). All experiments were done on at least two animals. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Experiments were performed from adult rat total RNA as previously described (18Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16655-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The following sense and antisense primers were used for PCR: ASIC3, CTGGCAACGGACTGGAGATTA and TGTAGTAGCGCACGGGTTGG (amplicon of 506 bp); NHERF-1, CGGCTCTGCACCATGAAGAA and CTCAGAGGTTGCTGAAGAGTTC (amplicon of 625 bp); and NHERF-2, ATACATCCGCTCTGTGGACCC and CTGCTGAGGCTTGGGGAGCT (amplicon of 576 bp). Twenty-five cycles of PCR (95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min) were performed, except for β-actin, for which only 22 cycles were done. One-third of the PCR was resolved on a 2% agarose gel. The PCR conditions have been designed to avoid overamplification and allow a better comparison between tissues. Transfection and Electrophysiology of COS-7 and F-11 Cells—COS cells were transfected with a mix of rat NHERF-1 and rat ASIC3 or ASIC3Δ3 cDNAs using the DEAE-dextran method. Cells were used for electrophysiological measurements 1-4 days after transfection. F-11 DRG cells cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (ICN Biomedicals), 1× HAT (sodium hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine), 200 μg/ml allo-4-hydroxy-l-proline (Sigma), and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin; Invitrogen) were transfected with NHERF-1 or NHERF-1ΔPDZ1 and rat ASIC3 cDNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were used for electrophysiological measurements 2-4 days after transfection. We used the patch clamp technique to measure membrane currents in whole-cell configuration. Currents were amplified with an RK-400 amplifier (Bio-Logic Science Instruments), digitized with a 16-bit data acquisition system (Digidata 1322A; Axon Instruments), and recorded on a hard disk using pClamp software (version 9.2.0.11; Axon Instruments). The currents were sampled at 10 kHz and low pass-filtered at 3 kHz. Off-line analysis of currents was performed using pClamp (Axon Instruments). The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.25), and the bath solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). MES was used instead of HEPES to buffer bath solution pH ranging from 6 to 5. For F-11 DRG cells, the bath solution was supplemented with 10 mm glucose, and the pipette solution was modified to 140 mm KCl, 2.5 mm Na2-ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.25). Oocyte Injection and Electrophysiology—Oocytes were kept at 19 °C in ND96 solution (containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES) supplemented with penicillin (6 μg/ml) and streptomycin (5 μg/ml). Currents were recorded within 3-5 days of DNA injections. In a 0.3-ml perfusion chamber, a single oocyte was gently impaled with two standard glass microelectrodes (1-2.5 megaohms) filled with a 3 mm KCl solution and maintained under voltage clamp using a Dagan TEV 200 amplifier. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pClamp software (Axon Instruments). All experiments were performed at 19 °C, and MES or acetic acid was used instead of HEPES to buffer ND96 solution pH ranging from 6 to 3. Statistical Analysis—Data points represent the mean ± S.E. of n independent experiments. The one-way analysis of variance test followed by a Tukey post hoc test was used for statistical analysis using Prism software (version 4.03; GraphPad). NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 Associate with the ASIC3 COOH Terminus in a Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The ASIC3 COOH terminus shares homology with type I PDZ-binding motifs ((S/T)X(V/L)) (23Songyang Z. Fanning A.S.

The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify putative ASIC3-interacting proteins. A rat DRG cDNA library (18Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16655-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was screened with the last 68 amino acids of rat ASIC3 as a bait. Among the isolated clones, one clone encoded a full-length NHERF-1 protein, also named EBP50 (ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa), and another encoded a partial NHERF-2 protein, also identified as E3KARP (Na+/H+ exchanger 3 kinase A-regulatory protein), TKA-1 (tyrosine kinase activator-1), or SIP-1 (SRY-interacting protein-1). NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 are PDZ-containing proteins that mediate specific protein-protein interactions and thereby can serve as adaptors. They have been involved in the regulation of the targeting and trafficking of specific integral membrane proteins (for a review, see Ref. 24Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Cunningham R. Weinman E.J. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). They both contain two tandem PDZ domains followed by a carboxyl-terminal sequence that binds to members of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family of membrane-cytoskeleton adaptors. The NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 clones isolated from the rat DRG library both contained functional PDZ domains, strongly suggesting an interaction between these PDZ domains and the COOH-terminal region of ASIC3. NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 Bind to ASIC3 through Their PDZ-1 Domain in Transfected COS Cells—To confirm the two-hybrid results and test the interaction with the full-length proteins, binding between NHERFs and ASIC3 was assayed by coimmunoprecipitation in transfected COS-7 cells. Constructs encoding Myc-tagged ASIC3 and HA-tagged NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 or mutant variants were co-transfected in COS cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies, followed by Western blot analysis. Wild-type ASIC3 interacted with NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 (Fig. 1, A (lane 1) and B (lane 7)), and association occurred regardless of which was initially precipitated (data not shown). This interaction was impaired by removing the last three amino acids of ASIC3, which form most of the PDZ binding motif (23Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) (ASIC3 Δ531-533 mutant; Fig. 1, A (lane 2) and B (lane 8)). As expected, NHERF-1 did not co-precipitate with ASIC1a and ASIC2a (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4), two ASIC subunits with a different COOH-terminal PDZ-binding motif. The two NHERF-1 PDZ domains have considerable structural homology but recognized distinct synthetic peptides matching the consensus sequence (S/T)(R/Y)L-COOH for PDZ-1 (similar to the COOH-terminal motif of ASIC3) and S(S/T)WL-COOH for PDZ-2 (25Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In good agreement with this, versions of NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 made with a deletion of the first or the second PDZ domain demonstrated that the PDZ-1 domain of NHERF-1 and NHERF-2, but apparently not the PDZ-2 domain, was necessary for the interaction (Fig. 1, A (lanes 5 and 6) and B (lanes 9 and 10)). However, surface plasmon resonance measurements have shown that both PDZ domains of NHERF-1 can interact with an immobilized peptide corresponding to the COOH terminus of CFTR (comprising the TRL motif) but that the PDZ-1/CFTR complex is formed much faster than the PDZ-2/CFTR interaction (26Raghuram V. Mak D.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We cannot therefore exclude the possibility of some weak interaction between ASIC3 and the PDZ-2 domain of NHERF-1 in certain conditions. NHERF-1 mutants with a COOH-terminal deletion of the last 30 or 60 amino acids were still able to associate with ASIC3 (supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that the ERM domain of NHERF-1 was not involved in the interaction. Levels of wild-type and mutant proteins were comparable in all of these experiments (Fig. 1, A (lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 5 and 6) and B (lanes 7-10)). These results demonstrate that the ASIC3 COOH-terminal PDZ binding motif interacts with the PDZ-1 domain of NHERF-1 and NHERF-2. They also suggest a constitutive association of NHERFs and ASIC3 in transfected mammalian cells. Phosphorylation of the ASIC3 COOH-terminal Domain Increases NHERF-1 Binding—Phosphorylation-dependent modulation of the interaction between PDZ proteins and PDZ binding motifs has been well documented. ASIC3 contains a conserved consensus site for phosphorylation by PKC in its intracellular COOH-terminal domain (Ser-523; Fig. 2A). Previous work has suggested that this residue is phosphorylated by PKC (20Deval E. Salinas M. Baron A. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19531-19539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have investigated the impact of phosphorylation at this position on the interaction between NHERF-1 and ASIC3. PKC stimulation by PMA increased ASIC3 co-precipitation with NHERF-1 by ∼50% in COS-7 cells co-transfected with Myc-ASIC3 and HA-NHERF-1 compared with a condition where PKC was inhibited with chelerythrine (Fig. 2, B (lanes 1 and 2) and C). A further indication that phosphorylation of serine 523 was likely to be involved in this regulation included the observation that the nonphosphorylatable glycine mutant (S523G) prevented the PMA effect (Fig. 2B, lane 3). In addition, a mutation mimicking phosphorylation in ASIC3 (S523D) mimicked the PMA effect despite the presence of chelerythrine (Fig. 2B, lanes 4). All of these data strongly suggest that PKC phosphorylation of serine 523 in the COOH-terminal region of ASIC3 positively modulates the interaction between ASIC3 and NHERF-1. NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 Increase ASIC3 Current in Xenopus Oocytes—We subsequently measured the effect of NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 on ASIC3 current in Xenopus oocytes. Both proteins were able to strongly potentiate the pH 5.0-evoked ASIC3 transient current amplitude when co-injected with the channel (∼6.4- and ∼7.7-fold increase, respectively; Fig. 3, A and B). The more dramatic effect was seen on the sustained current (∼30.9- and ∼42.4-fold increase, respectively, Fig. 3C). The pH dependence of the peak and sustained currents was not altered (Fig. 3D); nor was the selectivity of the sustained current (Fig. 3E). The kinetics of desensitization were only slightly modified (supplementary Fig. 2). The NHERF-1 PDZ-1 domain, but not the PDZ-2 domain, and the last COOH-terminal region of ASIC3 were required for the NHERF-1 effect to occur on both the peak and sustained current (Fig. 3, B and C), consistent with the biochemical data described in Fig. 1. Deletion of the NHERF-1 ERM-binding domain (NHERF-1Δ60) decreased the effect of NHERF-1 on the ASIC3 transient current (Fig. 3B). The amplitude measured in the presence of NHERF-1Δ60 was still higher than the amplitude observed with ASIC3 expressed alone (5.87 ± 0.70 μA (n = 18) versus 1.57 ± 0.24 μA (n = 90), respectively, p < 0.01). However, the amplitude was significantly lower than the one of ASIC3 co-expressed with wild type NHERF-1 (5.87 ± 0.70 μA (n = 18) versus 9.96 ± 0.73 μA (n = 79), respectively, p < 0.05). This suggests that the effect on the peak current is partially dependent on the interaction with ERM proteins and thereby on the association of the channel with the cytoskeleton. The NHERF-1Δ60 mutant had no significant effect on the sustained current (Fig. 3C), which may reflect differences in the regulation by NHERF-1 of the peak and the sustained components of the ASIC3 current. NHERF-1 Is Expressed in Native DRG Neurons, Where Its Distribution Partly Overlaps with That of ASIC3—We next examined the expression of NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 in native DRG neurons. NHERF-1 transcripts were detected in rat DRG by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 4A). The levels seemed lower than in epithelial tissues like lung and colon. However, the NHERF-1 protein was easily detected by Western blot in lysates from both rat and mouse DRG (Fig. 4B). These data confirmed the previous observation of high levels of the NHERF-1 protein in rat DRG neurons (27Melendez-Vasquez C.V. Rios J.C. Zanazzi G. Lambert S. Bretscher A. Salzer J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On the other hand, NHERF-2 transcripts are barely detected in rat DRG (Fig. 4A), and the protein was not detected in DRG neurons by Western blot (Fig. 4C) and immunohistochemistry (data not shown). The overlap in expression between ASIC3 and NHERF-1 was next analyzed in rat DRG by double in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. We used in situ hybridization to detect ASIC3 mRNA, and the NHERF-1 protein was subsequently identified on the same samples by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4E).

The spliced leader RNA consists of a small exon, the spliced leader, ranging in size from 15 to 52 nucleotides. The SL exon is followed by a 5′ splice site and an intron without a 3′ splice site. The recipient pre-mRNA substrate begins with an outron (an intron lacking a 5′ splice site) followed by an exon or several exons and introns. Trans-splicing adds the spliced leader sequence to the 3′ splice site of the outron, generating the mature 5′ end of the mRNA. Spliced leader addition provides not only the 5′-terminal sequence but also brings a new cap to the mature mRNA. In metazoa, a trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap (m2,2,7GpppN) is present on the spliced leader RNA, and thus the mRNAs acquire a TMG cap (4Van Doren K. Hirsh D. Mol. Cell.

SL addition thus represents a major form of gene expression present in divergent groups of eukaryotes. For some organisms and genes, a function for trans-splicing is known. Trans-splicing in concert with 3′ end formation serves to resolve polycistronic transcripts into monocistronic mRNAs for almost all genes in the kinetoplastida, ∼20% of Caenorhabditis elegans genes, several genes in the early chordate Oikopleura, and at least one schistosome gene locus (11Ganot P.

However, SL1 addition is responsible for the majority of trans-splicing in nematodes, accounting for 50–90% of trans-splicing in different nematodes. Notably, SL1 trans-splicing is not typically involved in resolution of polycistronic transcripts, and overall, its primary function remains unclear. Recently, we have shown that the addition of the TMG-capped SL1 to test transcripts does not have a significant effect on nematode mRNA stability and translation when compared with non-trans-spliced m7G-capped control RNAs (30Lall S.

However, SL1 trans-splicing may play a role in nematode translation by adding the spliced leader at a relatively conserved distance from the AUG of the recipient RNA endogenous open reading frame that is optimal for translation of TMG-capped RNAs (30Lall S.

Overall, however, the function of trans-splicing in several organisms remains unknown, and it remains to be determined what other functions trans-splicing may serve. The spliced leader sequence varies among different trans-splicing organisms. However, within a group of trans-splicing organisms, the SL sequence typically exhibits high sequence conservation. For example, the 22-nucleotide SL1 spliced leader is almost absolutely conserved in all nematodes. The high sequence conservation of the nematode SL may be required as the sequence constitutes part of the SL RNA promoter in Ascaris and contributes to the ability to translate mRNAs with the trimethylguanosine cap (30Lall S.

Flatworm spliced leaders exhibit a high degree of length and sequence variation, more than observed in some groups of trans-splicing organisms. The SL sequences range from 34 to 52 nucleotides in length (52 nucleotides is the longest SL known) and often have less than 50% nucleotide identity. The length and sequence variation in the SL is also accompanied by some variation in predicted flatworm SL RNA structure. Despite the significant SL length and sequence variation, several phylogenetically conserved nucleotides are present in divergent flatworm spliced leaders. Among these are an invariant 3′-terminal AUG. This is a unique characteristic of the flatworm SL not seen in spliced leaders from other organisms. In our original studies on schistosomes, the presence of the 3′-terminal SL AUG led us ask whether a function of transsplicing in flatworms might be to provide recipient mRNAs with an initiator methionine (33Davis R.E. Hardwick C. Tavernier P. Hodgson S. Singh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21813-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our initial sequence characterization of a small set of trans-spliced schistosome RNAs indicated that the majority of trans-spliced mRNAs contained an independent and endogenous 3′ initiator methionine for the primary open reading frame of the recipient mRNA. For these mRNAs, the SL AUG was upstream and out-of-frame with the primary open reading frame of the mRNA. Interestingly, we also identified two mRNAs for which the SL AUG was in-frame with the primary open reading frame of the mRNA. However, no additional bioinformatic or functional data were available to support the use of the SL AUG as an initiator methionine. Recently, large scale EST and cDNA sequencing efforts have been conducted on schistosome mRNAs (34Verjovski-Almeida S. DeMarco R. Martins E.A. Guimaraes P.E. Ojopi E.P. Paquola A.C. Piazza J.P.

These new sequence data have enabled us to further examine the question of whether the flatworm SL AUG serves to provide recipient mRNAs with a required initiator methionine for expression of the endogenous mRNA open reading frame. In the current study, we have provided extensive bioinformatic data demonstrating that the flatworm spliced leader contributes an initiator AUG to some mRNAs necessary for the synthesis of N-terminal residues conserved in the orthologous proteins of other organisms. In addition, we developed and used methods for transient RNA transfection to demonstrate that the schistosome-spliced leader AUG can functionally serve as an initiator methionine in vivo. Our results have expanded the known functions of trans-splicing and demonstrate that spliced leader addition in flatworms serves to contribute an initiator methionine for expression of some recipient mRNA open reading frames. Bioinformatic Analyses—Schistosome cDNAs with the spliced leader sequence were identified in the NCBI non-redundant and EST databases as well as the Schistosoma mansoni GeneDB using BLASTN. Spliced leader cDNAs were screened to eliminate clones containing non-terminal SL sequences. Non-terminal SL sequences can represent as high as 20–25% of the clones. 5′-terminal SL clones were analyzed to determine whether the SL AUG was in-frame with the major open reading frame (ORF) of the mRNA using either the NCBI ORF Finder or MacVector Software (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). cDNAs with two approximately equivalent ORFs were eliminated from the analysis, and only cDNAs with ORFs of at least 150 nucleotides were characterized. Clones with the SL AUG in-frame with the major mRNA ORF were then analyzed by BLASTX against protein databases. Resulting pairwise alignments derived from BLASTX were initially analyzed to determine whether 1) the SL AUG-initiated protein had similarity with proteins in the data base between the SL AUG and the next downstream AUG and 2) if the similarity in these residues was phylogenetically conserved among orthologous proteins. In many cases, the orthologous proteins were extracted from the databases and subjected to multiple sequence alignment with the predicted schistosome proteins to confirm conservation of residues. To be considered a cDNA that uses the SL AUG to initiate open reading frames, a minimum of 5 identical or functionally similar and phylogenetically conserved residues must be present between the SL AUG and the downstream AUG. The majority of SL AUG-initiated open reading frames exhibit much higher similarity (a higher percentage of identity and similarity between the SL AUG and next downstream AUG) with orthologous proteins. In addition, most assigned SL AUG-initiated proteins are also present in diverse phylogenetic groups representing vertebrates and at least two invertebrate groups. RNA Preparation for Transfection—PCR-generated templates for in vitro transcription were synthesized from pRL-null (Renilla luciferase) or pGL3 (firefly luciferase)(Promega, Madison, WI) using primers that introduce a T7 promoter and 5′-UTR sequences at the 5′ end of the luciferase ORF and a 60- or 85-nucleotide poly-A tail at the 3′ end. The in vitro transcription reactions (T7 Megascript, Ambion, Austin, TX) typically contained 1 μg of template/20-μl reaction, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm CTP, 10 mm UTP, 12 mm cap analogue (m7GpppG or m 2,2,73GpppG), 1.5 mm GTP, 1× reaction buffer, and 1× T7 polymerase mix and were carried out at 37 °C for 4 h. After DNase I treatment, the mRNA transcripts were extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and the RNAs were precipitated twice, once with isopropyl alcohol and then with 0.5 m ammonium acetate/ethyl alcohol. Precipitated RNAs were further washed with 70% ethyl alcohol, dissolved in water, quantitated spectrophotometrically, and examined by agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gel electrophoresis. Analysis of cap orientation on transcripts was carried out as described (36Cohen L.S. Mikhli C. Friedman C. Jankowska-Anyszka M. Stepinski J. Darzynkiewicz E. Davis R.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 1609-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and indicated that greater than 80% of the caps were added in the correct orientation. Schistosome Materials—Mice and hamsters infected with S. mansoni were provided by an National Institutes of Health contract through the Biomedical Research Institute and Fred Lewis. Additional S. mansoni-infected mice and hamsters were generously provided by Edward Pearce and Philip LoVerde, respectively. Adult schistosomes were perfused from the hepatic portal vasculature and maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS and 200 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Eggs were isolated from livers by gentle homogenization of infected livers in 1.5% saline followed by sequential filtering of the eggs through screens as described previously (37Lewis F.A. Stirewalt M.A. Souza C.P. Gazzinelli G. J. Parasitol. 1986; 72: 813-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 38Lewis F.A. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek J.A. Margulies D.E. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 19.1.1-19.1.28Google Scholar). Purified eggs were suspended in spring or MilliQ water to stimulate hatching of the miracidial larval stage. The larval stages were collected by migration toward light and concentrated by gentle centrifugation at 4 °C (38Lewis F.A. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek J.A. Margulies D.E. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 19.1.1-19.1.28Google Scholar). Miracidia were either used directly for biolistic experiments or transformed into sporocysts by 18–24 h of incubation in MEMSE-J with 1% bovine serum albumin and 200 μg/ml gentamycin at 26 °C in 5% CO2 and O2 (39Kawanaka M. Hayashi S. Ohtomo H. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 991-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 40Bixler L.M. Lerner J.P. Ivanchenko M. McCormick R.S. Barnes D.W. Bayne C.J. J. Parasitol. 2001; 87: 1167-1168PubMed Google Scholar). Following 18–24 h of incubation, the transformed sporocysts were maintained at 26 °C in MEMSE-J with 5% FCS and 200 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2 and O2. RNA Biolistics—Preparation of gold microcarriers and biolistics were performed essentially as described previously (41Davis R.E. Parra A. LoVerde P.T. Ribeiro E. Glorioso G. Hodgson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8687-8692Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 1) gold particles were spherical ∼2.2 μm gold from Degussa (10KM)(dmc2 Metals Group, South Plainfield, NJ) and 2) instead of lyophilization of the RNA onto the gold carriers, an alcohol precipitation was used. In vitro transcribed RNAs were precipitated onto gold particles using 2.5 m ammonium acetate/ethyl alcohol precipitation using either 0.25–5 μg of Renilla luciferase reporter RNA or 0.25–5 μg of firefly luciferase RNA/1 mg of gold particles. Luciferase activity in worms is RNA dose-dependent. The RNA/gold pellet was washed with 200 μl of ice-cold ethyl alcohol, resuspended in ice-cold 100% ethyl alcohol (18 μl/mg gold), and spread onto macrocarriers and processed as described previously (41Davis R.E. Parra A. LoVerde P.T. Ribeiro E. Glorioso G. Hodgson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8687-8692Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Binding of RNA onto the gold particles was evaluated by formaldehyde agarose gel analysis to determine the integrity of RNA bound to the beads, and RiboGreen (Molecular Probes) (42Jones L.J. Yue S.T. Cheung C.Y. Singer V.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was used to quantitate RNA loaded onto the particles for data normalization. Analysis of RNA bound to beads indicated that little to no degradation of the RNA occurred prior to particle bombardment and that typically 80–85% of the precipitated RNA was bound onto the gold particles. Freshly perfused adult schistosomes were incubated in medium in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 3 h to overnight prior to bombardment. 30 worm pairs in medium were carefully placed into the center of 35-mm Petri dishes, and just prior to bombardment, the medium was removed. The adults were bombarded with 1 mg of RNA-coated gold particles in a Bio-Rad Biolistic PDS-1000/HE particle delivery system at 15 inches of mercury of chamber vacuum, target distance of 3 cm (stage 1), and 1,550-psi particle acceleration pressure. In many experiments, the adults were immediately bombarded a second time. This effectively doubles the level of expression observed. After bombardment, 2–3 ml of RPMI plus 10% FCS and 200 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin was added, and the adults were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h before the adults were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and frozen prior to lysis for luciferase assays. Evaluation of gold particle delivery was carried out as described previously (41Davis R.E. Parra A. LoVerde P.T. Ribeiro E. Glorioso G. Hodgson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8687-8692Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For particle bombardment of miracidia and sporocyst, freshly isolated miracidia or 18–24-h transformed sporocysts were suspended in MEMSE-J with 1% bovine serum albumin and 200 μg/ml gentamycin, and ∼1000 miracidia or sporocysts were gently spread onto the center of 35-mm Petri dishes in a minimal volume. Optimal biolistics parameters were determined to be 15 inches of mercury of chamber vacuum, target distance of 6 cm (stage 2), and 450-psi particle acceleration pressure. Following bombardment, 2 ml of Media F or MEMSE-J plus 1% bovine serum albumin or 5% FCS were added, and the miracidia or sporocysts were incubated at 26 °C in 5% CO2 and O2 for 3 h before they were collected, washed in media, pelleted, and frozen prior to lysis for luciferase assays. Bombarded miracidia develop into viable sporocysts that can be maintained for several weeks. RNA Electroporation of Sporocysts—600 –2000, 18–24-h-old sporocysts were resuspended in 100 μl of MEMSE-J with 1% FCS. The sporocysts were placed into prechilled 0.4-cm electroporation cuvettes, RNA was added to 50 μg/ml, and electroporation was carried out in a BTX ECM 830 (square wave) electroporator (BTX, Holliston, MA) at 280 volts using a 0.5-ms pulse length. Following electroporation, the sporocysts were suspended in 2 ml of MEMSE-J with 5% FCS/200 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin and incubated at 26 °C in 5% CO2 and O2 for3h before they were collected, washed in media, pelleted, and frozen prior to lysis for luciferase assays. Luciferase and Protein Assays—Frozen pellets of adult or larval schistosome stages were resuspended in 150 μl of the recommend lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and homogenized in Kontes disposable PEL-LET PESTLES® with Microtubes (Vineland, NJ) several times using several freeze-thaw cycles and multiple passes with a motor-driven pestle. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and aliquots (20 μl) of the supernatant were assayed using the Promega Renilla, luciferase, or Dual-Luciferase assay systems with a Sirius luminometer (Zylux Corp., Oak Ridge, IN)) (41Davis R.E. Parra A. LoVerde P.T. Ribeiro E. Glorioso G. Hodgson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8687-8692Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Dual-Luciferase assays were used in conjunction with co-transfection of two reporters (firefly and Renilla luciferase) as normalization for transfection efficiency and biological variation. Protein assays on lysates were carried out using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit and Compat-Able protein assay preparation reagent set (Pierce). Experimental data were similar with or without normalization to a co-transfected reporter and to protein concentrations in sample lysates. Thus, some experimental data are presented with normalization, whereas other data are not. Conservation of the Flatworm SL AUG and Its Sequence Context—An alignment of the known flatworm spliced leaders and a subalignment of their 3′ ends are presented in Fig. 1, A and B. The alignments illustrate the absolute sequence conservation of the 3′-terminal AUG of flatworm spliced leaders as well as the AUG sequence context. We previously derived a schistosome translation initiation AUG consensus from a small set of non-trans-spliced schistosome mRNAs. Re-evaluation of this consensus in light of additional sequences (∼300) indicates that it is still valid with the larger sampling (33Davis R.E. Hardwick C. Tavernier P. Hodgson S. Singh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21813-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The non-trans-spliced mRNA translation initiation consensus along with the consensus of the flatworm SL AUG are shown in Fig. 1B. The schistosome translation initiation AUG context for non-trans-spliced mRNAs conforms to that observed in higher eukaryotes and a variety of invertebrates (43Mankad R.V. Gimelbrant A.A. McClintock T.S. Biol. Bull. 1998; 195: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 44Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 45Cavener D.G. Ray S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) with a highly conserved purine in the –3 position (Fig. 1C). Notably, all the flatworm SL AUGs have a U in the –3 position instead of a purine. Bioinformatic Analysis of SL cDNAs and ESTs—We previously noted that the schistosome SL AUG was typically not in-frame with major open reading frames of recipient mRNAs (33Davis R.E. Hardwick C. Tavernier P. Hodgson S. Singh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21813-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, we observed two mRNAs (corresponding to ∼5% of the trans-spliced mRNAs we originally identified) for which the SL AUG was in-frame with the major ORF of the recipient mRNA. Available bioinformatic data at the time did not support the conservation of the protein sequence between SL AUG and the next 3′-AUG with orthologous protein sequences in databases. The large increase in known and predicted protein sequences from a breadth of organisms, as well new EST and cDNA data for schistosomes (34Verjovski-Almeida S. DeMarco R. Martins E.A. Guimaraes P.E.

https://openalex.org/W1999060423,"DNA binding is central to the ability of p53 to function as a tumor suppressor. In line with the remarkable functional versatility of p53, which can act on DNA as a transcription, repair, recombination, replication, and chromatin accessibility factor, the modes of p53 interaction with DNA are also versatile. One feature common to all modes of p53-DNA interaction is the extraordinary sensitivity of p53 to the topology of its target DNA. Whereas the strong impact of DNA topology has been demonstrated for p53 binding to sequence-specific sites or to DNA lesions, the possibility that DNA structure-dependent recognition may underlie p53 interaction with other types of DNA has not been addressed until now. We demonstrate for the first time that conformationally flexible CTG·CAG trinucleotide repeats comprise a novel class of p53-binding sites targeted by p53 in a DNA structure-dependent mode in vitro and in vivo. Our major finding is that p53 binds to CTG·CAG tracts by different modes depending on the conformation of DNA. Although p53 binds preferentially to hairpins formed by either CTG or CAG strands, it can also bind to linear forms of CTG·CAG tracts such as canonic B DNA or mismatched duplex. Intriguingly, by binding to a mismatched duplex p53 can induce further topological alterations in DNA, indicating that p53 may act as a DNA topology-modulating factor.

Cells are equipped with extraordinarily sensitive surveillance systems, which are able to monitor genomic DNA for the appearance of any unprogrammed alterations that may pose a danger to the structural integrity of the genome (1Lowndes N.F. Murguia J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Li L. Zou L. J. Cell.

Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The appearance of just one or two double strand breaks in a cell is sufficient for rapidly putting the system into a “high alert” mode, marked by the activation of signaling pathways that are responsive to DNA damage (5Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar, 6Zhou B.B. Anderson H.J. Roberge M. Cancer Biol.

The ability to function either in a “stand by” or in an activated high alert mode is also a hallmark of the tumor suppressor p53, one of the key factors involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity (8Albrechtsen N. Dornreiter I. Grosse F. Kim E. Wiesmuller L. Deppert W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7706-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J.

Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Activation of p53 is an essential component of the global response of the cell to acute genotoxic insults that leads to rapid stabilization of the p53 protein and to p53 functioning in a high alert mode (12Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 13Saito S. Yamaguchi H. Higashimoto Y. Chao C. Xu Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37536-37544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). As a DNA damage-inducible factor, p53 can be potently activated by various types of genotoxic stimuli (9Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar, 14Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 15Robles A.I. Harris C.C. Acta Oncol. 2001; 40: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A causative relationship between the occurrence of damaged DNA and the activation of the p53 response has been established by studies in a cell-free system demonstrating that sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 (p53-SSDB) can be potently stimulated by free DNA ends (16Jayaraman J. Prives C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In vitro DNA binding analyses further revealed that the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of p53 can bind selectively to some types of aberrant DNA structures in a sequence-independent manner (17Lee S. Elenbaas B. Levine A. Griffith J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 18Stansel R.M. Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These findings led to the proposal that p53 may recruit cellular repair factors to the sites of damage by directly binding to DNA lesions in a DNA structure-dependent fashion (20Dudenhoffer C. Rohaly G. Will K. Deppert W. Wiesmuller L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5332-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21Degtyareva N. Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8778-8784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Notably, it appears that such sequence-independent and DNA structure-selective DNA binding of p53 (p53-DSSB) may not necessarily be exclusively associated with damaged DNA, because some types of DNA structures to which p53 binds with high affinity in vitro can form in cells under physiological conditions. Indeed, non-canonic DNA structures such as cruciforms, hemicatenated DNA, DNA bulges, three- and four-way junctions, or telomeric t-loops can all be bound by p53 (18Stansel R.M. Subramanian D.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7215-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previous studies provided valuable mechanistic insights into the principal features that appear to be characteristic of p53-DSSB. p53-DSSB is mediated by the p53 core DNA-binding domain in cooperation with the p53 C terminus, whereas the N-terminal domain may have some modulating effect (26Cain C. Miller S. Ahn J. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39944-39953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Ahn J. Prives C. Nat. Struct.

Although apparently unaffected by mutations in the p53 core domain, p53-DSSB requires an intact tetramerization domain indicating that the tetramer is the major active form not only in p53-SSDB (29Wang Y. Reed M. Wang P. Stenger J.E. Mayr G. Anderson M.E. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 30Mateu M.G. Fersht A.R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41192-41203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Gohler T. Jager S. Warnecke G. Yasuda H. Kim E. Deppert W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1087-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast to p53-SSDB, which is determined by specificity to both sequence and DNA structure (32Gohler T. Reimann M. Cherny D. Walter K. Warnecke G. Kim E. Deppert W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41192-41203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34McKinney K. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the specific architecture of DNA is the major common determinant underlying p53 interaction with DNAs that share no apparent sequence homology. DNA junctions such as those formed in hairpins, cruciforms, Holliday structures, or recombination intermediates are important structural elements determining p53 binding (20Dudenhoffer C. Rohaly G. Will K. Deppert W. Wiesmuller L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5332-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Jett S.D. Cherny D.I. Subramaniam V. Jovin T.M. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1087-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mismatched bases comprise another type of structural element to which p53 can bind with varying affinity depending on the type of mismatch (21Degtyareva N. Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8778-8784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The findings indicate that the specific three-dimensional structure of DNA determines substrate specificity of p53-DSSB. However, neither the physiological relevance of p53-DSSB nor its significance to known p53 activities is fully understood. This is largely due to the fact that, with the exception of telomeric t-loops (18Stansel R.M. Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. J. Biol.

The identification of naturally existing genomic sequences with known functions that can be targeted by p53 via DSSB is of paramount importance for elucidating whether there is any physiological significance of p53-DSSB and its relation to p53 functions. Considering that p53 binds to unusual DNA structures, we wondered whether there might be an interaction between p53 and structures formed by CTG·CAG tracts, which represent conformationally flexible genomic DNA sequences with the propensity to form unusual structures (36Pearson C.E.

Like many types of repeat sequences, CTG·CAG tracts have a high propensity to be genetically unstable. There is much interest in the mechanisms leading to genetic instability of CTG·CAG tracts, because expansions within them cause a number of different hereditary neurological diseases, including myotonic dystrophy, Huntington disease, and several spinocerebellar ataxias (38Bacolla A. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47411-47414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 39Wells R.D. Dere R. Hebert M.L. Napierala M. Son L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3785-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although the molecular details leading to expansion are not completely understood, it has become clear that the genetic stability of repeat tracts can be influenced by most aspects of DNA metabolism, including various DNA repair pathways (38Bacolla A. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47411-47414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 39Wells R.D. Dere R. Hebert M.L. Napierala M. Son L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3785-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is thought that formation of non-linear DNA structures formed by self-folding of the CTG or the CAG strand is an important causative factor of instability associated with CTG·CAG repeats (40Wells R.D. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 887PubMed Google Scholar, 41Bowater R.P. Wells R.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 159-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kovtun I.V. Goellner G.

Biosci. 2002; 27: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is a strong causative relationship between the formation of hairpin structures by CTG·CAG tracts and the occurrence of DNA breakpoints (reviewed in Ref. 38Bacolla A. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47411-47414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expansion of CAG repeats can activate the DNA damage checkpoint pathway (44Lahiri M. Gustafson T.L. Majors E.R. Freudenreich C.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 287-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating that cellular factors responsive to DNA damage may be involved in the control of the CTG·CAG DNA stability. We report in this study that trinucleotide CTG·CAG repeats comprise a novel physiological p53 target binding site, to which p53 binds via p53-DSSB. Our data show for the first time that p53 interacts with CTG·CAG tracts in naked DNA as well as in the context of chromatin and that p53 binds to alternative conformations adopted by CTG·CAG tracts via different binding modes. Whereas the physiological relevance of the interaction of p53 with CTG·CAG tracts remains to be elucidated, our finding that CTG·CAG DNA can be targeted by p53 under physiological conditions is intriguing, because it points to the possibility that replication-dependent instability of genomic DNA containing CTG·CAG tracts might be influenced by p53. Preparation of DNA Substrates—DNA-substrates were prepared from synthetic oligonucleotides shown in TABLE ONE. 100 pmol of CTG11, CAG11, p53BS-2, or the appropriate sense oligonucleotide were 5′-labeled by T4-DNA polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. To obtain double-stranded DNA substrates, the 5′-labeled sense DNA strand was annealed with the corresponding unlabeled antisense DNA strand in 100 μl of annealing buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) at a molar ratio of 1:2. Structured DNA substrates were obtained by annealing the 5′-labeled CTG11, CAG11, or p53BS-2 DNA with the unlabeled Lock oligonucleotide in 100 μl of annealing buffer at a molar ratio of 1:4. The annealed DNA was purified by electrophoresis in a 8% polyacrylamide gel. Single-stranded labeled oligonucleotides were loaded alongside DNA hybrids as a reference for electrophoretic mobility. The band corresponding to the hybrid DNA resulting from annealing was excised, submerged into the annealing buffer, and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Eluted DNA was concentrated by acetone precipitation and resuspended in the annealing buffer.TABLE ONEOligonucleotides used in the studyOligonucleotideSequenceDNA substratesLock5′-CCGCGGTACCATTACCTAAGGCCCC-3′CTGhairpin and CAGhairpin and p53BS-2CTG11CTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGhairpin5′-GGGGCCTTAGGTA ATGGTACCGCGG-3′CAG11CAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGhairpin5′-GGGGCCTTAGGTA ATGGTACCGCGG-3′CTG13-senseCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTG·CAG and CTG·CTGT·T5′-CGGAATTC CTTAAGGC-3′CTG13-antisenseCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTG·CTGT·T5′-GCCTTAAG GAATTCCG-3′CAG13-senseCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAG·CAGA·A5′-CGGAATTC CTTAAGGC-3′CAG13-antisenseCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCTG·CAG and CAG·CAGA·A5′-GCCTTAAG GAATTCCG-3′p53BS-2AGTTAAGTCCTGACTTGTCTp53BS-2hairpin5′-GGGGCCTTAGGTA ATGGTACCGCGG-3′p53BS-2sense5′-CGGAATTC AGTTAAGTCCTGACTTGTCT CTTAAGGC-3′p53BS-2linp53BS-2antisense5′-GCCTTAAG AGACAAGTCAGGACTTAACT GAATTCCG-3′p53BS-2linDNASPEC-sense5′-GAGCTGGTCAAGTTCAGACACGTTCCGAAACTGCAGTAAAAGGAGTTAAGTCCTGACTTGTCTCCAGC-3′DNASPECDNASPEC-antisense5′-GCTGGAGACAAGTCAGGACTTAACTCCTTTTACTGCAGTTTCGGAACGTGTCTGAACTTGACCAGCTC-3′DNASPEC Open table in a new tab Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—DNA binding experiments were performed using 50 ng of recombinant human p53 proteins expressed in insect cells and purified as described (32Gohler T.

After 20 min of preincubation at room temperature, 20 kcpm of the labeled DNA probe (1–5 ng) in 5 μl of DNA binding buffer were added, and the incubation was continued for another 20 min at room temperature. DNA binding of SSB was analyzed under essentially the same conditions except that the probe was incubated with 25 ng of the SSB protein (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) either alone or in the presence of p53. The samples were analyzed on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (10 mm Tris·CH3COOH, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.25 mm NaOAc, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and separated at 200 V for 2 h at room temperature. Gels was dried and subjected to autoradiography. DNase I Footprinting—DNA binding by p53 was performed under the same conditions as described in the previous section.

The human osteosarcoma cell line SaOs-2 is null for p53 (ATCC). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—Transient transfection was performed essentially as described previously (46Kim E. Gunther W. Yoshizato K. Meissner H. Zapf S. Nusing R.M. Yamamoto H. Van Meir E.G. Deppert W. Giese A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7716-7727Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, LNZ308/2024 cells were plated into a six-well tissue culture plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at a density 0.2 × 106/well and transfected by nucleoporation (Amaxa, Köln, Germany). The transfections were done in triplicates using 0.5 μg of reporter DNA/well. Transfected cells were incubated either in the absence or the presence of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) and harvested 24 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was measured in lysates prepared from the transfected cells by using the luciferase assay system from Promega. Luciferase activity was normalized against total protein amounts determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Cloning and Stable Transfections—Nineteen CTG·CAG19 repeats were cloned into the AflII site of the pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany), which is suitable for transfection of eukaryotic cells and enables selection of transfected cells by resistance to neomycine. p53-null SaOs-2 cells were stably transfected with 2.5 μg of either pEYFP-C1 or pEYFP-CTG·CAG19 plasmids using Effectene™ transfection reagent (Qiagen). Transfected cells were maintained for 3 weeks in the selection medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. Genomic DNA was isolated from the selected clones resistant to G418 and analyzed for the presence of pEYFP-C1 or EYFP-CTG·CAG19 sequences by PCR using EYFP-for (5′-CATGGTCCTGCTGGAGTTCGTG-3′) and EYFP-rev (5′-GGAACAACACTCAACCCTATCTCG-3′) primers. The identities of the resulting PCR products were confirmed by sequencing.

Dehde), respectively. 2 × 106 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and transfected the next day with 2 μg of pCMV-wtp53 or pCMV-Tag-R273H using Effectene™ transfection reagent (Qiagen). 36 h after transfection, ChIP was performed with the polyclonal antibody p53(FL-393) (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany) as described previously (46Kim E.

Semi-quantitative PCR was performed in 100 μl of PCR buffer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using 100 nm primers, 200 μm dNTP mix, 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase and 10% (v/v) of the immunoprecipitated DNA or 1% (v/v) of input DNA. PCR protocol included an initial denaturation step (2 min at 95 °C) followed by 35 cycles of 50 s at 95 °C, 50 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Primers for GAPDH and mdm2(P2) were those described in Ref. 48Kaeser M.D. Iggo R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar. EYFP-for and EYFP-rev primers were used to amplify stably integrated pEYFP-C1 or pEYFP-CTG·CAG19 (specific PCR products of 520 or 628 bp, respectively). In Vitro Preparation and Analyses of DNA Structures Formed by CTG·CAG Triplets—Formation of non-canonical DNA structures such as slipped strand DNA or slipped intermediate DNA are thought to be the cause of the CTG·CAG DNA expansion associated with some neurodegenerative diseases (41Bowater R.P. Wells R.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 159-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kovtun I.V. Goellner G. McMurray C.T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 49Pearson C.E. Sinden R.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Slipped strand or slipped intermediate DNA can result from a misaligned annealing of CTG and CAG DNA strands that can fold back to form asymmetric hairpin structures branching out from three-way junctions (3WJ) (36Pearson C.E. Tam M. Wang Y.H. Montgomery S.E. Dar A.C. Cleary J.D. Nichol K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4534-4547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, 3WJ structures that contain hairpin and mismatched duplex formed by self-annealed CTG or CAG strands correspond to the basic structural elements of the biologically relevant DNA structures such as slipped strand or slipped intermediate DNA. We prepared DNA templates that recapitulate CTG·CAG tracts either in the canonical B-form (CTG·CAGB-duplex), or in non-canonical DNA conformations (3WJ structures CTGhairpin and CAGhairpin contain hairpins, whereas CAG·CAGA·A or CTG·CTGT·T DNAs correspond to a mismatched homoduplexes formed by CTG or CAG repeats, respectively). 3WJ structures were designed as depicted in supplemental Fig. S1 (shown for CTGhairpin). CTG·CTGT·T and CAG·CAGA·A structures contain multiple pairs of T·T or A·A mismatches, respectively. To ensure that the expected structures were formed, we assessed the DNA structure either enzymatically, using endonucleases (restriction enzymes or T7-EndoI) or chemically, with OsO4 and diethyl pyrocarbonate (supplemental Fig. S1). The patterns of the T7-EndoI cleavage or reactivity with OsO4 and diethyl pyrocarbonate were fully concordant with the formation of the expected structures and the stereochemical features established in structural analyses of hairpins formed by CTG or CAG triplets (50Petruska J.

Interaction of Wild Type p53 with CTG·CAG Tracts in Alternative Conformations of DNA—Having confirmed the structure of our DNA substrates, we examined p53 binding to different conformations of CTG·CAG tracts by EMSA. Note that 3WJ structures that contain hairpins formed by CTG or CAG triplets appear in 4% native polyacrylamide gels as two bands migrating with differing mobility (Fig. 1, A, lanes 9 and 17, and B, lane 17). Whereas the faster migrating band comprises the major population of 3WJ structures containing a hairpin, the form of the DNA contained within the slower migrating band is unknown. We infer that the slower migrating band corresponds to a conformational isomer formed by CTG or CAG repeats. Such an interpretation would be concordant with the fact that the slower migrating band appeared in the preparations of 3WJ structures after they have been initially isolated as a single band from the preparative 8% gel. EMSA experiments showed that all of the DNA structures were bound by wtp53, which formed a single major complex (Fig. 1A, p53·DNA complex in lanes 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18). The complex was specific for p53, as is evident from the retardation of its mobility in the presence of the p53-specific antibody DO-1 (lanes 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20). The specificity of p53 binding was also evident from the characteristic inhibitory effects of the p53-specific antibody PAb421 (lanes 3, 7, 11, 15, and 19), which binds at the C-terminal domain of p53 and is a known in vitro modulator of both p53-SSDB (54Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) and p53-DSSB (32Gohler T. Reimann M. Cherny D. Walter K. Warnecke G. Kim E.

https://openalex.org/W2076980131,"Staphylocoagulase (SC) is a protein secreted by the human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, that activates human prothrombin (ProT) by inducing a conformational change. SC-bound ProT efficiently clots fibrinogen, thus bypassing the physiological blood coagulation pathway. The crystal structure of a fully active SC fragment, SC-(1-325), bound to human prethrombin 2 showed that the SC-(1-325) N terminus inserts into the Ile16 pocket of prethrombin 2, thereby inducing expression of a functional catalytic site in the cognate zymogen without peptide bond cleavage. As shown here, SC-(1-325) binds to bovine and human ProT with similar affinity but activates the bovine zymogen only very poorly. By contrast to the ∼2-fold difference in chromogenic substrate kinetic constants between human thrombin and the SC-(1-325)·human (pro)thrombin complexes, SC-(1-325)·bovine ProT shows a 3,500-fold lower kcat/Km compared with free bovine thrombin, because of a 47-fold increase in Km and a 67-fold decrease in kcat. The SC-(1-325)·bovine ProT complex is ∼5,800-fold less active compared with its human counterpart. Comparison of human and bovine fibrinogen as substrates of human and bovine thrombin and the SC-(1-325)·(pro)thrombin complexes indicates that the species specificity of SC-(1-325) cofactor activity is determined primarily by differences in conformational activation of bound ProT. These results suggest that the catalytic site in the SC-(1-325)·bovine ProT complex is incompletely formed. The current crystal structure of SC-(1-325)·bovine thrombin reveals that SC would dock similarly to the bovine proenzyme, whereas the bovine (pro)thrombin-characteristic residues Arg144 and Arg145 would likely interfere with insertion of the SC N terminus, thus explaining the greatly reduced activation of bovine ProT.

Pathogenic bacteria exploit and subvert several host processes and signaling pathways (1Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 136-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). For example, some secreted or cell wall-bound bacterial proteins can efficiently activate trypsin-like serine proteinase zymogens circulating in the blood plasma of the host. From a mechanistic point of view, these bacterial activators can be grouped into proteolytic and nonproteolytic ones (2Boyle M.D. Lottenberg R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The former class comprises proteinases capable of cleaving host zymogens at their physiologic Arg15-(Ile/Val)16 activation sites (using the chymotrypsinogen numbering for the catalytic domain residues of serine proteinases). This cleavage liberates a new N terminus with a typical (Ile/Val)16-(Val/Ile)17 sequence, which inserts into the preformed “Ile16 pocket” of the zymogen and engages in a strong salt bridge with the Asp194 carboxylate. The corresponding rotation of the Asp194 side chain induces formation of a functional active site (for a recent review on zymogen activation mechanisms see Ref. 3Khan A. James M.

The second group of activators is formed by several nonenzymatic proteins, which upon binding induce functional active sites in their cognate serine proteinase zymogens. Proteolysis of the Arg15-(Ile/Val)16 bond is not needed for activation but can occur as an epiphenomenon of the activation mechanism (6Boxrud P.D. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

The N-terminal sequences of SK and SC (SKIle1-Ala-Gly and SCIle1-Val-Thr, respectively; superscripts identify cofactor residues) mimic those of mature trypsin-like catalytic domains. These conformational zymogen activators are thought to be necessary to spread and maintain infections by their respective Gram-positive pathogens. Species-specific zymogen activation by SK and SC is a well documented and poorly understood caveat to their cofactor function. SK is highly specific for conformational activation of human Pg among other species, but the catalytic SK·Pg/Pm complexes proteolytically activate Pg from a broad range of species (17McCoy H.E. Broder C.C. Lottenberg R. J. Infect. Dis. 1991; 164: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The resistance of murine Pg to activation by SK has impeded the development of versatile animal models of human streptococcal infection. As elegantly shown recently in a transgenic mouse model expressing only human Pg, tissue invasion by the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes is critically dependent on human Pg, SK, and the bacterial Pg/Pm-binding M-like protein (i.e. PAM) to generate Pm that degrades fibrin and the extracellular matrix (18Sun H. Ringdahl U. Homeister J.W. Fay W.P. Engleberg N.C. Yang A.Y. Rozek L.S. Wang X. Sjobring U. Ginsburg D. Science. 2004; 305: 1283-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Given the conservation in sequence and fold exhibited by members of the chymotrypsinogen family of serine proteinases across species, the high specificity of SC for activation of human ProT is similarly quite remarkable. Here we present for the first time peptide substrate and Fbg clotting studies that establish limits on the ability of SC-(1-325) to activate bovine ProT compared with human ProT and the effect of SC-(1-325) binding on bovine thrombin activity. The results suggest that compared with SC-(1-325)·human ProT, the catalytic site in SC-(1-325)·bovine ProT is incompletely formed. Surprisingly, equilibrium binding results indicate that SC-(1-325) binds bovine ProT witha1to1 stoichiometry and only ∼12-fold weaker than to the human zymogen. We also present the crystal structure of SC-(1-325) bound to bovine α-thrombin, along with a more detailed description and comparison of the atomic interactions in the SC-(1-325)·human (pre)thrombin and SC-(1-325)·bovine thrombin complexes to define structural differences responsible for the species specificity of ProT activation by SC.

Chromogenic Substrate Kinetics and Fbg Clotting Activity—Hydrolysis of the thrombin substrate, H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA by bovine α-thrombin and the SC-(1-325)·bovine (pro)thrombin complexes was followed by monitoring the absorbance increase at 405 nm in 50 mm Hepes, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4 buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, at 25 °C. Stoichiometric factors (n) were determined by fitting of the quadratic binding equation to initial rates of hydrolysis of 100 μm H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA by bovine α-thrombin (1 nm) or bovine ProT (50 nm) as a function of the total SC-(1-325) concentration. The kinetic parameters, kcat, Km, and Ki for the product, when appropriate, were determined by simultaneous fits of the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation including competitive product inhibition to full reaction progress curves determined at H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA concentrations of 15, 31, and 62 μm with 1 nm bovine thrombin in presence or absence of saturating SC-(1-325). For SC-(1-325)·bovine ProT cleavage of H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA, kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to initial rates collected over a substrate concentration range of 0-4 mm. In all of the assays, SC-(1-325) and bovine (pro)thrombin were preincubated for at least 20 min, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate. Fbg clotting activity relative to a human thrombin standard was measured with a fibrometer from the slopes of plots of clotting time against the reciprocal of the enzyme concentration essentially as described (19Panizzi P.

Competitive Binding of SC-(1-325) to Native Bovine ProT and Human [OG]FPR-ProT Measured by Fluorescence—The effect of native bovine ProT on SC-(1-325) binding to 0.11 nm [OG]FPR-ProT was measured in fluorescence titrations with native bovine ProT, at fixed concentrations of SC-(1-325) (1, 11, and 110 nm), following a previously detailed procedure (20Panizzi P.

Direct titration of [OG]FPR-ProT with SC-(1-325) in the picomolar range was performed by incubation of individual reactions for ≥16 h in the dark to assure that equilibrium had been reached. These long incubations were not necessary for titrations at probe concentrations in the nanomolar range. Fluorescence measurements of individual binding reactions and analysis of competitive binding were performed as described in the companion paper (20Panizzi P. Friedrich R. Fuentes-Prior P. Kroh H.K.

Crystallization and Structure Solution—Bovine ProT was purified from fresh ox blood and activated using Oxyuranus scutellatus venom (Latoxan). Thrombin was inhibited with d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (Bachem) and mixed with an equimolar amount of purified SC-(1-325). The complex was purified by anion exchange chromatography on a TSK gel DEAE-5PW column (Tosoh Bioscience) and concentrated using Centricon YM 30 filters (Millipore). Crystals grew out of solutions containing 0.1 m imidazole, pH 7.0-7.5, 0.2 m ammonium formate, 12% polyethylene glycol 4,000. These crystals diffracted only to medium resolution but allowed collection of a complete data set “in house” from a single crystal mounted on a capillary, using a MAR345 image plate system (Marresearch) installed on a RIGAKU rotating anode generator (Rigaku Corp.). The data were processed with MOSFLM (www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/harry/mosflm/) and scaled and reduced using programs supported by CCP4 (www.ccp4.ac.uk/main.html). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the corresponding human complex as search model and refined using data to 3.5 Å resolution with programs of the CNS suite (xplor.csb.yale.edu/cns_solve/). Strong noncrystallographic restraints were applied throughout refinement. The atomic coordinates of the SC-(1-325)·bovine α-thrombin complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 2A1D. Activation of Bovine ProT by SC-(1-325) and Its Effect on Bovine α-Thrombin Activity—There have been conflicting reports regarding the species specificity of SCs from different isolates. SC from strain Tager 104 was reported to protect human thrombin, but not bovine thrombin, from antithrombin-mediated inhibition (24Hendrix H. Lindhout T. Mertens K. Engels W. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3637-3644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Raus and Love (25Raus J. Love D.N. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1991; 29: 570-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported qualitative differences in the clotting activities of SCs isolated from Staphylococcus intermedius and S. aureus from different animal sources when their complexes with human or bovine ProT were probed against human, bovine, or equine Fbg. No affinity constants have been determined for ProT from various species, however, so it remains to be clarified whether these differences result from impaired ProT activation because of loss of affinity or loss of activity or because the SC·ProT activator complex is unable to cleave substrate Fbg. We compared the cofactor activities of SC-(1-325) against human ProT and its bovine homolog. Despite the high similarities both at the sequence and structural level of human and bovine thrombin (81% overall and 87% catalytic domain sequence identity, respectively; ∼0.45 Å root mean square deviation of all defined α-carbon atoms in the catalytic domains (26Brandstetter H. Turk D. Hoeffken H.W. Grosse D. Sturzebecher J. Martin P.D. Edwards B.F. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1085-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar)), SC-(1-325) was a much poorer activator of bovine ProT. The reason for this puzzling observation is clarified below. Chromogenic substrate kinetic studies were performed to determine the effects of SC-(1-325) on activation of bovine ProT and on the activity of bovine thrombin. SC-(1-325) activated bovine ProT with a stoichiometric factor of 0.85 ± 0.07 mol SC-(1-325)/mol ProT and with a maximal rate of 0.051 ± 0.003 ΔA405 nm/min at 50 nm SC-(1-325)·bovine ProT complex and 100 μm H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA (Fig. 1). SC-(1-325) binding to bovine α-thrombin resulted in a 1.9-fold hyperbolic decrease in the rate of substrate hydrolysis by the complex, characterized by a stoichiometry of 1.1 ± 0.6 mol SC-(1-325)/mol thrombin and an apparent dissociation constant (KD) of 0.3 ± 0.2 nm (Fig. 1). The results demonstrated that SC-(1-325) bound both bovine ProT and α-thrombin and that the SC-(1-325)·bovine ProT complex was ∼60-fold less active as compared with the SC-(1-325)·human ProT complex under the conditions of the assays, indicating that SC-(1-325) is a much more effective activator of the human zymogen. The effect of SC-(1-325) on the chromogenic substrate activity of bovine thrombin was examined further by full progress curve analysis to determine Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters for α-thrombin and the SC-(1-325)·α-thrombin complex. In the presence of SC-(1-325), the specificity constant (kcat/Km) for bovine α-thrombin decreased 5-fold, because of a 1.4-fold decrease in kcat and a 3-fold increase in Km (Table 1). Kinetic constants determined for the SC-(1-325)·bovine ProT complex by initial rates indicated a 3,500-fold lower kcat/Km compared with free α-thrombin. In addition to the 47-fold increase in Km, indicating significantly weaker substrate binding, kcat for hydrolysis of H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA by the SC-(1-325)·bovine ProT complex was 1.4 ± 0.1 s-1 (Table 1), reduced 67-fold compared with α-thrombin. The results demonstrated that SC-(1-325) activates bovine ProT but that the activity of the complex (kcat/Km) toward H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA compared with the SC-(1-325)·bovine thrombin complex is 740-fold lower, whereas the SC-(1-325) complex with human ProT is ∼2-fold more active than SC-(1-325)·human thrombin measured with the same substrate (20Panizzi P.

Compared with human thrombin, the SC-(1-325) complexes with human (pro)thrombin had indistinguishable activity toward human Fbg and also exhibited a similar, 3-4-fold lower activity with bovine Fbg. Bovine thrombin and SC-(1-325)·bovine thrombin complex had essentially the same activities of 67 and 96%, respectively, as human thrombin toward human Fbg and lower activities of ∼30% toward bovine Fbg. By contrast, the SC-(1-325)·bovine ProT complex exhibited only 0.07% of the clotting activity of human thrombin toward human Fbg. Moreover, the clotting activity of the bovine complex with bovine Fbg was undetectable at concentrations up to 46 μm. These results indicated a small 3-4-fold dependence of the clotting activity on the species of Fbg for human and bovine thrombin and the corresponding SC-(1-325)·thrombin complexes. In these results, the 5-fold lower kcat/Km of the SC-(1-325)·bovine thrombin complex for chromogenic substrate compared with bovine thrombin (Table 1) was not reflected in the clotting activity (Table 2). Remarkably, however, the 3,470-fold lower kcat/Km for chromogenic substrate hydrolysis by the SC-(1-325)·bovine ProT complex was correlated with a 1,400-fold lower clotting activity toward human Fbg and an undetectably lower activity toward bovine Fbg. These results indicated that the greatly reduced Fbg clotting activity of the SC-(1-325)·bovine ProT complex results from its low catalytic activity and suggested a minor role for species-specific recognition of substrate Fbg.TABLE 2Effect of SC-(1-325) binding on Fbg clotting activity of human and bovine (pro)thrombinSpeciesEnzymeBovine FbgHuman Fbg%%Humanα-Thrombin25100SC-(1-325)·ProT2570SC-(1-325)·α-thrombin30111Bovineα-Thrombin3167SC-(1-325)·ProTND0.07SC-(1-325)·α-thrombin3096 Open table in a new tab Competitive Binding of SC-(1-325) to Native Bovine ProT and [OG]FPR-ProT—Competitive binding experiments were carried out to determine the affinity of SC-(1-325) for bovine ProT by the use of human [OG]FPR-ProT as a competitive binding probe. Simultaneous fits of direct and competitive titrations determined that SC-(1-325) bound human [OG]FPR-ProT with a stoichiometry of 1.0 ± 0.1 mol SC-(1-325)/mol labeled ProT and a dissociation constant (KD) of 16 ± 9 pm, consistent with values determined in the companion paper (20Panizzi P.

Analysis of competitive binding of [OG]FPR-ProT and native bovine ProT demonstrated that SC-(1-325) bound native bovine ProT with a KD of 0.2 ± 0.1 nm (Fig. 2). These results indicated that SC-(1-325) binds very tightly to bovine ProT and suggested that high affinity binding may not be the sole determinant of effective zymogen activation by SC-(1-325).

The N-terminal domain D1 (residues SCIle1 to SCGln142) essentially comprises three α-helices (α1D1 to α3D1), which range in length from 25 to 41 residues (Fig. 3). The three α-helices are slightly wound around each other to form a left-handed α-helical coiled-coil. The C-terminal SC domain D2 comprises residues SCThr150 to SCGly281 and also contains a three-helix bundle formed by helices α1D2 to α3D2. The two major helix bundles are topologically similar (Fig. 4A) but are only distantly related at the sequence level, pointing to an early gene duplication event. The centers of the helix bundles are occupied by a number of medium-sized hydrophobic side chains, which are mainly leucine residues in D1 but more varied in D2. These side chains pack together in a “knobs-in-holes” manner, creating a quite hydrophobic core free of buried water molecules or polar groups. In add"

The results reveal that π-π stacking interactions of Trp60 and Phe126, electrostatic interactions of Lys89 and Arg155, and hydrogen bonding by Glu131 make crucial contributions to 2-5A binding.

In the absence of 2-5A, RNase L exists as an inactive monomeric form. 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylate the ankyrin repeat domain (1-333 residues) of human RNase L with an N-terminal His tag 5′-O-monophosphoryladenylyl(2′→5′)adenylyl(2′→5′)adenosine the ankyrin repeat domain of mouse RNase L glutathione S-transferase. 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylate the ankyrin repeat domain (1-333 residues) of human RNase L with an N-terminal His tag 5′-O-monophosphoryladenylyl(2′→5′)adenylyl(2′→5′)adenosine the ankyrin repeat domain of mouse RNase L glutathione S-transferase. Aberrations of the stringent regulation of RNase L activity are thought to be associated with various diseases. For example, mice that are unable to express RNase L show an increased susceptibility to viral infections (5Zhou A. Paranjape J. Brown T.L. Nie H. Naik S. Dong B. Chang A. Trapp B. Fairchild R. Colmenares C. Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6355-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), and humans with RNase L mutations are at risk for hereditary prostate cancer (6Casey G. Neville P.J. Plummer S.J. Xiang Y. Krumroy L.M. Klein E.A. Catalona W.J. Nupponen N. Carpten J.D. Trent J.M. Silverman R.H. Witte J.S. Nat.

In addition, a truncated form of RNase L, which is thought to be constitutively active, may be a biochemical marker of chronic fatigue syndrome, a disorder characterized by debilitating fatigue associated with immunological abnormalities (8Tiev K.P. Demettre E. Ercolano P. Bastide L. Lebleu B. Cabane J. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2003; 10: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). RNase L activity is regulated by its N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (residues 24-335), at which 2-5A is recognized and bound (9Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22236-22242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An ankyrin motif consisting of 33 amino acid residues is the most frequently occurring repeat structure in nature (10Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In human RNase L, the ankyrin repeat domain is composed of eight complete and one partial ankyrin motifs, which suppresses the activity of the C terminus (residues 583-720) ribonuclease domain of RNase L (9Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22236-22242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Dong B. Niwa M. Walter P. Silverman R.H.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3929-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Upon binding 2-5A, the suppression by the ankyrin repeat domain is released, thus inducing the activation of RNase L. A conformational change was, in fact, observed for a solely expressed ankyrin repeat domain of RNase L upon binding of 2-5A (13Nakanishi M. Goto Y. Kitade Y. Proteins. 2005; 60: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One striking property of this enzyme ligand pair is their unique affiliation. That is, RNase L is the only enzyme that recognizes and binds 2-5A, whereas the only known function of 2-5A is to activate RNase L. We have recently reported the crystal structure of the ankyrin repeat domain of human RNase L complexed with 2-5A (12Tanaka N. Nakanishi M. Kusakabe Y. Goto Y. Kitade Y. Nakamura K.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3929-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Tanaka N. Nakanishi M. Kusakabe Y. Goto Y. Kitade Y. Nakamura K.T. Protein Pept. Lett. 2005; 12: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This structure shows a typical ankyrin repeat configuration; i.e. each repeat consists of pairs of anti-parallel α-helices stacked side by side that are connected by a series of intervening β-hairpin motifs (10Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The ankyrin domain of RNase L is characterized by a distinctive curved structure and the existence of an extra helix between repeats 4 and 5. The ligand 2-5A is bound by the second to the fourth ankyrin repeats and interacts with the RNase L residues Trp60, Asn65, Gln68, Lys89, Phe126, Glu131, Tyr135, and Arg155 by forming hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, or stacking interactions (12Tanaka N. Nakanishi M. Kusakabe Y. Goto Y. Kitade Y. Nakamura K.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3929-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, the extra helix has been found to constitute the bottom of the 2-5A binding site. To determine the contribution of these residues and the extra helix to the binding of 2-5A, we have now designed nine point mutants and a deletion mutant of the ankyrin repeat domain protein and full-length RNase L. Biochemical characterization of these mutants allowed us to determine the 2-5A binding determinants of human RNase L. Expression Constructs—For the expression of the ankyrin repeat domain of human RNase L with an N-terminal His tag (hANK), we used the pQEHisXaANK plasmid (12Tanaka N. Nakanishi M. Kusakabe Y. Goto Y. Kitade Y. Nakamura K.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3929-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The QuikChange® method was used to introduce site-directed mutations on the plasmid, using the pairs of complementary oligonucleotide primers listed in TABLE ONE. The plasmids encoding human RNase L and including the same mutations as the hANK mutants were generated from pGEXRNL (15Yoshimura A. Nakanishi M. Yatome C. Kitade Y. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) by substituting an equivalent 0.6-kb PstI-NcoI fragment of pQEHisXaANK. This 0.6-kb fragment encodes residues 22-228 of RNase L. All constructs were verified by sequencing the entire hANK-coding region of isolated plasmids.TABLE ONEOligonucleotide primers used for site-directed mutagenesisMutationPrimer sequenceaSense strand primers.

Nakanishi M. Kusakabe Y. Goto Y. Kitade Y. Nakamura K.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3929-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The RNase L mutants were expressed as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion enzymes in E. coli strain JM109 and purified by chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column and gel filtration on a Sephacryl S200HR column, as described previously (16Nakanishi M. Yoshimura A. Ishida N. Ueno Y. Kitade Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 2-5A Binding Assay—The 2-5A binding ability of hANK was assayed by static fluorescence spectroscopy (13Nakanishi M. Goto Y. Kitade Y. Proteins. 2005; 60: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fluorescence emission spectra of hANK were measured from 295 to 385 nm, with the excitation wavelength set at 280 nm. The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined from the relationship between the 2-5A concentration and the fluorescence quenching at 340 nm, upon the addition of 5′-O-monophosphoryladenylyl(2′→5′)adenylyl(2′→5′)adenosine (pApApA) to the solution of ANK, according to the following equation, a+b α=(Lo−Eoα)nKd+(Lo−Eoα)n where α is the ratio of quenched fluorescence intensity at a specified pApApA concentration (ΔF) to the fully quenched fluorescence intensity (ΔFmax), Lo is the total concentration of pApApA, Eo is the total concentration of hANK, and n is the Hill coefficient. The n values ranged from 0.8 to 1.2. RNase Activity Assay—5′-Labeled RNA substrate (5′-fluorescein-C11U2C7-3′) was synthesized with an Applied Biosystems DNA/RNA synthesizer (Model Expedite) using phosphoroamidite units from GLEN Research (Sterling, VA). The oligonucleotide (1 μm) was digested in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 1 mm ATP, and 8 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 0-2 μm pApApA and 20 nm GST-RNase L for 30 min at 30 °C. An aliquot (10 μl) of the reaction mixture was electrophoresed on a 20% polyacrylamide/7 m urea/1× Tris borate-EDTA gel. The labeled RNA in the gel was quantified using a Typhoon system (Amersham Biosciences). The activity of RNase L was expressed as a percentage of the cleaved product. Molecular Modeling—The three-dimensional structure of the ankyrin repeat domain of mouse RNase L (mANK) was modeled from the crystal structures of human ANK (Protein Data Bank accession code 1WDY) at the SWISS-MODEL Internet server (www.expasy.org/swissmod/) (17Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4375) Google Scholar, 18Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

The structure was displayed using the CueMol program (R. Ishitani, CueMol: Molecular Visualization Framework; cuemol.sourceforge.jp). A solvent-excluded surface of hANK was calculated using the program MSMS (20Sanner M.F. Olson A.J. Spehner J. Proceedings of the 11th ACM Symposium on Computional Geometry. 1995; (Vancouver, BC, Canada, June 5-7, 1995, pp.): C6.7Google Scholar). Scheme of Site-directed Mutagenesis—Wild-type hANK is composed of eight ankyrin repeat elements, designated 1-8 from the N terminus, forming a significantly curved structure (12Tanaka N. Nakanishi M. Kusakabe Y. Goto Y. Kitade Y. Nakamura K.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3929-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The ligand 2-5A fits into the concave side of hANK and interacts with residues from repeats 2 and 4. Repeat 2 interacts with the third AMP unit of pApApA, and repeat 4 binds the first and second AMP moieties of pApApA (Fig. 1). Trp60 in repeat 2 is responsible for the π-π stacking interaction with the adenine ring of the third AMP unit (Ade3), whereas Asn65 and Gln68 in repeat 2 fix the same adenine ring by a hydrogen bond network (OD1(Asn65)-N6(Ade3) and ND2(Asn65)-O(Wat)-N7(Ade3)) and (OE1(Gln68)-N6(Ade3) and NE2(Gln68)-N1(Ade3)), respectively. In addition, Lys89 electrostatically interacts with the phosphoryl residue of the third AMP moiety (Phos3), and Phe126 in repeat 4 is responsible for the π-π stacking interaction with the adenine ring of the first AMP moiety (Ade1). Glu131 in repeat 4 fixes Ade1 by bifurcated hydrogen bonds (OE1(Glu131)-N6(Ade1) and OE2(Glu131)-N1(Ade1), whereas Tyr135 in repeat 4 binds to the adenine ring of the second AMP moiety (Ade2) by a single hydrogen bond (OH(Tyr135)-N1(Ade2)), and Arg155 forms a salt bridge with the 5′-monophosphoryl group of the first AMP moiety (Phos1). In addition, an insertion helix αI (residues 159-164) constitutes a bottom of the first AMP moiety binding site. During site-directed mutagenesis, each of the eight residues mentioned above was replaced by Ala, and the insertion αI-helix (residues 157-166) was deleted. All of the mutants were expressed in E. coli as His-tagged proteins and purified. Because the deletion mutant aggregated during purification, it was not further characterized. Although all of the substitution mutants were purified, the yield of the R155A mutant was low because of its tendency to precipitate. 2-5A Binding Ability of the hANK Mutants—The ability of purified wild-type and mutant hANKs to bind 2-5A was assayed using a static fluorescence technique. The fluorescence spectrum of hANK showed a peak at 340 nm, which was due to its single and solvent-exposed Trp residue (Trp60) (Fig. 2A). Upon the addition of 2-5A, the fluorescence intensity of hANK was attenuated as the concentration of 2-5A was increased. Because these attenuations reflect changes in the environment of Trp60 caused by 2-5A binding, these correlations allowed us to estimate the 2-5A binding ability of hANK. For wild-type hANK, the degree of fluorescence attenuation (ΔF) followed saturation kinetics relative to pApApA concentration (Fig. 2B). The Kd value of wild-type hANK for pApApA was calculated as 0.10 μm from the equation shown under “Materials and Methods.” The mutation of Gln68 by Ala (Q68A) resulted in a saturation kinetics similar to that of wild-type and a slightly increased Kd value (0.27 μm), indicating a minor contribution of the hydrogen bond formed between Gln68 and Ade3 for pApApA binding (Fig. 2 and TABLE TWO). The disruption of the hydrogen bonds formed by Asn65 (N65A) with Ade3 affected more than just the case of Q68A. The simultaneous mutations of Asn65 and Gln68 (NAQA) resulted in an additive effect for impairing its affinity to 2-5A but still maintained a low affinity for the ligand. The single mutation of Tyr135 (Y135A), which hydrogen bonded with Ade2, also moderately reduced the affinity, as was the case with N65A. In contrast, the substitution of Ala for Glu131 (E131A) resulted in a linear relationship of ΔF (rather than saturation kinetics) to pApApA, implying impaired ability of the mutant to bind 2-5A. In this case, we were not able to estimate a reliable Kd value under the experimental conditions. The mutation of the residues involved in the salt bridge formations (K89A and R155A) gave results similar to those observed for E131A, indicating that these residues provide critical contributions to 2-5A binding. Two residues (Trp60 and Phe126) interact with 2-5A through π-π stacking effects. Because the F126A mutant also showed the linear relationship, the critical role of the residue in 2-5A binding was suggested. On the other hand, substitution of Trp60 by Ala (W60A) resulted in the disappearance of the 340-nm fluorescence peak, because Trp60 is the responsible fluorophore. Therefore, this method could not be applied to the analysis of the W60A mutant. The contribution of Trp60 to 2-5A binding and RNase L function will be described in the next section.TABLE TWOKd values of wild-type and mutant hANKMutantKdaThe values are mean ± SD (n = 3).FoldμmWild-type0.10 ± 0.011N65A1.83 ± 0.1718Q68A0.27 ± 0.022.7NAQA5.40 ± 0.1154K89ANDbND, not determined.F126ANDE131ANDY135A3.65 ± 0.7437R155ANDa The values are mean ± SD (n = 3).b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Effects of Mutations on Full-length RNase L Activity—Because hANK is part of RNase L and does not exist independently in nature, we could not rule out the possibility that the effects of point mutations on hANK/pApApA binding were artifacts. To determine the effects of these mutations on overall RNase L activity, we constructed full-length RNase L mutants as GST fusion forms (9Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22236-22242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Dong B. Niwa M. Walter P. Silverman R.H. RNA. 2001; 7: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Nakanishi M. Yoshimura A. Ishida N. Ueno Y. Kitade Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because 2-5A activated the enzyme, RNase L mutants lacking 2-5A binding activity should be enzymatically inactive. Moreover, this assay used synthetic oligo(RNA)-bearing 5′-fluorescein (5′-fluorescein rC11UUC7-3′) for better quantitative results. The molecular species of full-length RNase L are described with the prefix “RNL” to discriminate them from those of hANK. Although we could purify the deletion mutant RNL ΔαI, it was still labile (Fig. 3A). We observed RNA degradation in RNL wild type, RNL N65A, RNL Q68A, RNL NAQA, and RNL Y135A (Fig. 3B), with Km for 2-5A of 4, 64, 23, 168, and 131 nm, respectively (TABLE THREE). These values could be correlated with the Kd data obtained by analyzing the hANK species. That is, the mutations at Asn65 and Tyr135 affected the affinity for 2-5A more than that at Gln68, and the affinity of the Gln68 mutant for 2-5A was comparable with that of wild type. The combined double mutations, NAQA, additively reduced the RNase activity. The decrease of the Vmax value may represent that proper fitting of 2-5A through hydrogen bond interactions is required, not only for activation of RNase L, but also for efficient catalysis. As for the other mutants, no significant degradation was detected.TABLE THREEKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant GST-RNase LMutantKm for 2-5AVmaxVmax/Kmnm%Wild-type4.09524W60ANDNDN65A64771.2Q68A23924.0NAQA168830.49K89ANDNDF126ANDNDE131ANDNDY135A131680.52R155ANDNDΔ α INDND Open table in a new tab Homology of the Ankyrin Repeat Domain of Human and Mouse RNase L—The genes encoding RNase L are found in mice (21Zhou A.

Because the functions of the mouse enzyme have been studied extensively (5Zhou A. Paranjape J. Brown T.L. Nie H. Naik S. Dong B. Chang A. Trapp B. Fairchild R. Colmenares C. Silverman R.H.

Commun. 2004; 325: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we compared the structures of mouse RNase L and hANK. We hypothesized that residues important for 2-5A recognition and binding should be conserved. Homology modeling of the ankyrin repeat domain from mANK was performed by taking advantage of a high sequence homology with human RNase L, with residues 21-305 of human RNase L and 21-304 of mouse RNase L having 65.6% sequence identity, allowing fairly accurate prediction of the structure of mANK (Fig. 4). The backbone of mANK could be superimposed nearly completely on that of hANK (Fig. 4A). According to this model, the positions and orientations of the side chains of the target residues identified in this study were highly conserved between the human and mouse proteins, with the exception of residue 135, which was Tyr in hANK and Arg in mANK (Fig. 4B). The 135th residue was not conserved, but the residues occupied a similar position enabling them to be able to form a hydrogen bond with Ade2. The model supported the result that the mutation of Tyr135 had a moderate effect on 2-5A binding, although the residue was not conserved. Mutagenesis at Gln68 of the human enzyme was less effective than that at Tyr135, despite this residue being conserved among all four species. This suggests that Gln68 shares 2-5A binding with Asn65 by constituting a hydrogen bond network. We have used structure-based site-directed mutagenesis to identify the human RNase L residues crucial for the recognition and binding of 2-5A. The contributions of each residue were verified using two different methods, fluorescence spectrometry and RNase L activation assay. Furthermore, the results of the RNase L activation assay indicate the validity of the hANK/2-5A interaction mode that was previously revealed by crystal structure analysis. Substitution for either Trp60 or Phe126 significantly hampered the 2-5A binding ability of RNase L, as well as inactivating 2-5A-dependent RNase activity, indicating that the π-π stacking interactions Trp60-Ade3 and Phe126-Ade1 are critical for 2-5A binding. In general, stacking effects are fundamental non-covalent interactions that are more common in the recognition of single-stranded nucleic acids. For example, stacking interactions are important for single-stranded nucleic acid binding by the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold (24Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 25Bogden C.E. Fass D. Bergman N. Nichols M.D. Berger J.M. Mol.

Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 27Raghunathan S. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and other RNA-binding proteins (28Antson A.A. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Greaves R.B. Chen X. Gollnick P. Nature. 1999; 401: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). They are also used by mRNA cap-binding proteins to recognize methylated guanosine (29Quiocho F.A. Hu G. Gershon P.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, although 2-5A is an unusual nucleic acid, its recognition by RNase L is based on a relatively general mechanism. Mutations of residues Lys89 and Arg155 also led to inactivation of RNase L, indicating the importance of the electrostatic interactions Lys89-Phos3 and Arg155-Phos1 for 2-5A binding. The positions and orientations of these residues were conserved in the structure of mANK, confirming that at least a single 5′-phosphoryl group is required for the efficient activation of human RNase L (30Dong B. Xu L. Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Lee X. Torrence P.F. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14153-14158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with the 2-5A trimer with the 5′-triphosphoryl group (pppApApA), the 2-5A trimer without the 5′-phosphoryl group (ApApA, known as the “core” species) has only ∼0.1% the ability to activate human RNase L. In addition, the tetramer or pentamer 2-5A core (ApApApA or ApApApApA) activates RNase L ∼25-fold more efficiently than the trimer core. This improvement could be explained by the formation of a salt bridge between Arg155 and the phosphoryl group between the first and second AMP moiety of the 2-5A tetramer core, thus increasing the affinity of the latter to RNase L. In addition, Arg155 may stabilize the ankyrin repeat structure by forming a salt bridge with the side chain of Asp174 at the third ankyrin repeat (Fig. 5). As mentioned previously under “Results,” R155A mutant was prone to precipitation. If this precipitation were caused by the lack of a salt bridge between Arg155 and Asp174 leading to structural disorder, this structural stabilization would be another important role of Arg155. The importance of Lys89 and Trp60 may be due to the inability of 2-5A dimers to activate RNase L. It has been reported that 2-5A dimers with 5′-triphosphoryl groups, at concentrations up to 1 μm, do not activate human RNase L (30Dong B. Xu L. Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Lee X. Torrence P.F. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14153-14158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of the four hydrogen bonds depended on their positions. Substitution of Gln68 or Asn65 by Ala had a limited effect on hANK and full-length RNase L. Even the double mutant of the residues still maintains the 2-5A binding and RNase activity. Accordingly, Ade3 is fixed by the π-π stacking interactions with Trp60 primarily and by the hydrogen bondings secondarily. This suggests that N1 of Ade3 can be substituted by other atoms when artificial 2-5A is designed. N6 of Ade3 is, however, important for interaction with RNase L, because the position is recognized by both Asn65 and Gln68. In practice, pppApApG, which possesses O6 instead of N6, showed no activation of RNase L (31Drocourt J-L. Dieffenbach C.W. Ts'O P.O.P. Justesen J. Thang M.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2163-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The mutation of Tyr135 abolished its hydrogen bond with Ade2 and resulted in moderate effects on 2-5A binding and RNase activity. The dominant contribution to fix Ade2 in an appropriate position would be the stacking interaction between Ade1 and Ade2. The inability of the E131A mutant to bind 2-5A showed that the hydrogen bond between Glu131 and Ade1 was also critical. Unlike Ade3, hydrogen bonding to Ade1 is provided only by Glu131, and mutation therefore directly affected the phenotype. Deletion of the region containing the αI-helix also increased the inactivation of RNase L. This may have been due to the improper placement of Arg155 rather than the absence of the bottom framework of the 2-5A binding site. Fig. 5 shows the structures of wild-type hANK and ΔαI, which were built by homology modeling. This model shows that Arg155 was relocated as a result of the deletion. This relocation results in a steric clash between Arg155 and Phos1, and with a spoilage of the electrostatic interaction between Arg155 and Asp174. Therefore, these mutants are likely to cause structural disorders. As mentioned under “Results,” both the ΔαI mutant and R155A were easy to aggregate, suggesting that the role of the extra α-helix may be to set Arg155 into its proper position. There are numerous ankyrin repeat proteins, which share a common three-dimensional structure, i.e. helix-loop-helix structures with a β-hairpin/loop region projecting outward from the helices at a 90° angle stack side by side. Nevertheless, hANK is the sole molecule to bind 2-5A, due, at least in part, to the five interactions shown here. Optimal binding requires two π-π stacking interactions by Trp60 and Phe126, one hydrogen bond by Glu131 and two salt bridges by Lys89 and Arg155. All of these interactions should be taken into account when developing new ligands that activate RNase L. Conversely, it may be possible to use other ankyrin repeat proteins to bind 2-5A. In conclusion, we have identified the crucial residues of human RNase L for the binding of its essential activator, 2-5A. The information is valuable for designing new anti-viral drugs based on the 2-5A antivirus system. Determination of the three-dimensional structure of the RNase L·2-5A·RNA ternary complex will provide further insight into the enzymatic mechanism of this unique protein."
