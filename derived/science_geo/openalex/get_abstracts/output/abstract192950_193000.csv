Here we report evidence that the PLCγ1-dependent pathway of FcϵRI-mediated activation of mast cells is independent of PI 3-kinase activation. In primary cultures of human mast cells, FcϵRI aggregation induced a rapid translocation and phosphorylation of PLCγ1, and subsequent inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production, which preceded PI 3-kinase-related signals. In addition, although PI 3-kinase-mediated responses were completely inhibited by wortmannin, even at high concentrations, this PI 3-kinase inhibitor had no effect on parameters of FcϵRI-mediated PLCγ activation, and had little effect on the initial increase in intracellular calcium levels that correlated with PLCγ activation. Wortmannin, however, did produce a partial (∼50%) concentration-dependent inhibition of FcϵRI-mediated degranulation in human mast cells and a partial inhibition of the later calcium response at higher concentrations. Further studies, conducted in mast cells derived from the bone marrow of mice deficient in the p85α and p85β subunits of PI 3-kinase, also revealed no defects in FcϵRI-mediated PLCγ1 activation. These data are consistent with the conclusion that the PLCγ-dependent component of FcϵRI-mediated calcium flux leading to degranulation of mast cells is independent of PI 3-kinase. However, PI 3-kinase may contribute to the later phase of FcϵRI-mediated degranulation in human mast cells.

Aggregation of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcϵRI) on the surface of mast cells initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events leading to degranulation and the release of proinflammatory mediators.

Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 222-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane-associated PIP2 thereby generating diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate; essential factors, respectively, for the activation of protein kinase C and intracellular calcium mobilization (1Beaven M.A. Metzger H. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 222-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), both of which are necessary signals for degranulation (2Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Munshinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of the PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 isoforms are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation by association with receptors that possess inherent tyrosine kinase activity, such as Kit (3Rottapel R. Reedjik M. Williams D.E. Lyman S.D. Anderson D.M. Pawson T. Berstein A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3043-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), or recruitment of cytosolic tyrosine kinases as is the case with members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Generally, PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 isoforms are independently expressed in specific cells types. For example, T cells express only PLCγ1 (4Weiss A. Koretsky G. Schatzman R.C. Kaldecek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), whereas B cells express only PLCγ2 (5Coggeshall K.M. McHugh J.C. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5660-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mast cells are one of the few cell types that express both PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 isoforms (6Barker S.A. Caldwell K.K. Pfeiffer J.R. Wilson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 6: 1145-1158Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). phospholipase C bone marrow-derived mast cells high affinity receptor for IgE human mast cells knock-out chimeric human Fc-specific anti-4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl IgE 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-bovine serum albumin conjugate phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase inositol trisphosphate interleukin 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol heat shock protein glutathione S-transferase PIP2, PIP3, phosphatidylinositol monophosphate, bisphosphate, and trisphosphate, respectively. Two alternative models have been proposed for receptor-mediated regulation of the catalytic activities of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 (7Wilde J.I. Watson S.P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In B cells, PLCγ2 appears to be regulated by a PI 3-kinase dependent mechanism preceded by activation of the src kinases, p56lyn and fyn, and p72syk (8Okada T. Maeda A. Iwamatsu A. Gotoh K. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 2000; 13: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In T cells, PLCγ1 appears to be activated following recruitment to the cell membrane via the adaptor molecules SLP76 and LAT, mediated by the src kinase, lck, and ZAP70 (9Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) in a PI 3-kinase independent manner (10Reynolds L.F. Smyth L.A. Norton T. Freshney N. Downward J. Kioussis D. Tybulewick V.L. J.

Science. 1999; 283: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Based on studies conducted primarily in the rodent RBL 2H3 mast cell line, the current view is that PLCγ activation in mast cells, as in B cells, is dependent on PI 3-kinase (6Barker S.A. Caldwell K.K. Pfeiffer J.R. Wilson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 6: 1145-1158Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7Wilde J.I. Watson S.P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), however, our data with human mast cells indicated that this is not the case. This finding prompted us to investigate the pathways of activation of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 and the role of PI 3-kinase in the intracellular events leading to degranulation in CD34+ peripheral blood progenitor-derived human mast cells (HuMCs) after FcϵRI aggregation. To further investigate the role of PI 3-kinase in FcϵRI-dependent PLCγ1-mediated mast activation, we examined these responses in BMMCs deficient in the p85α and p85β subunits of PI 3-kinase. As will be shown, the immediate PLCγ1-mediated component of mast cell degranulation following FcϵRI aggregation is independent of PI 3-kinase, however, PI 3-kinase may contribute to a later phase of the degranulation response. Cell Isolation and Culture—HuMCs were developed from CD34+ cells in StemPro-34 culture media (Invitrogen) containing l-glutamine (2 mm) (Biofluids, Rockville, MD), penicillin (100 units/ml) (Biofluids), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Biofluids), IL-6 (100 ng/ml) (PeproTech), and stem cell factor (100 ng/ml) (PeproTech), as described (12Kirshenbaum A.S. Goff J.P. Semere T. Foster B. Scott L.M. Metcalfe D.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-3 (30 ng/ml) was included for the first week of culture. Experiments were conducted on these cells 8–10 weeks after the initiation of culture, at which point, the population was greater than 99% mast cells. For studies using mouse BMMCs the following KO mice were obtained: p85α-/-:p85β+/+ (BALB/c) (13Terauchi Y. Tsuji Y. Satoh S. Minoura H. Murakami K. Okuno A. Inukai K. Asano T. Kaburagi Y. Ueki K. Nakajima H. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. Sekihara H. Yin Y. Barrett J.C. Oda H. Ishikawa T. Akanuma Y. Komuro I. Suzuki M. Yamamura K. Kodama T. Suzuki H. Kadowaki T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) from Taconic Labs, Germantown, NY, and p85α+/+:p85β-/- (129/Sv X C57BL/6) as described (14Ueki K. Yballe C.M. Brachmann S.M. Vicent D. Watt J.M. Kahn C.R. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The absence or presence of p85α and p85β in these mice was confirmed by PCR and, in the case of p85α, by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). BMMCs were obtained by flushing bone marrow cells from the femurs of either these KO mice or wild type mice, then culturing for 4–6 weeks in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine (4 mm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), nonessential amino acids (1 mm), HEPES (25 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (50 mm), and mouse recombinant IL-3 (30 ng/ml) (Peprotech). At this point, the murine mast cell population was greater than 99% pure. RBL 2H3 cells and the U937 human monocytic cell line were cultured in Iscove's media, supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%) (Biofluids), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator of 95% air, 5% CO2. Cell Activation—HuMCs were sensitized overnight in culture media containing chimeric human Fc anti-4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP)-specific IgE (NP-IgE) (Serotec, Raleigh, NC) (1 μg/ml) and then triggered by the addition of 10 μl of 10× NP-BSA (30:1) conjugate (Biosearch Technologies Inc. Novoto, CA) (final concentration 100 ng/ml), as described (15Tkaczyk C. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 268: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When the effects of inhibitors were examined, these, or controls, were added 10 min prior to the addition of NP-BSA. BMMCs were similarly treated, however, these cells were sensitized using mouse monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl IgE and then triggered by the addition on dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin. Subcellular Fractionation—To separate the membrane and cytosolic fractions, sensitized HuMCs or BMMCs were re-suspended in 200 μl of HEPES/BSA (0.04%) and activated as above. At predetermined times, the tubes were transferred into ice and equal volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (Tris-HCl, 20 mm; dithiothreitol, 2 mm; EGTA, 1 mm; EDTA, 2 mm; pH 7.5), containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added (15Tkaczyk C. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 268: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cells were disrupted by sonication twice on wet ice for 10 s and then the tubes were spun at 20,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatants (cytosolic fractions) and the pellets (membrane fractions) were re-suspended in sample buffer. The samples were then boiled for 3 min and centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 5 min prior to loading the samples onto gels. For inhibitor studies, the cells were pretreated with PP2, piceatannol, or wortmannin (Calbiochem, Carlsbad, CA) for 10 min prior to the addition of antigen. Gel Electrophoresis—All gel electrophoresis supplies were obtained from Invitrogen. Proteins were separated on 4–12% NuPage BisTris gels and probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) conjugated to biotin, anti-human p72syk (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), anti-rodent p72syk, anti-PI 3-kinase p85α and p110α, -β, and -δ, anti-PLCγ1, anti-PLCγ2, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-PLCγ1 (pY783), (BIOSOURCE, Camrillo, CA), anti-phospho-Src (pY416), anti-phospho-AKT (polyclonal pS473 and monoclonal pS473), anti-phospho-p70 S6 kinase (pT389) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and anti-PI 3-kinase p85β (Acris, Bad Nauheim, Germany). Following rinsing and incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody or streptavidin, the immunoreactive bands were visualized utilizing a Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). To confirm equal protein loading onto gels, membranes were stripped and re-probed as described (12Kirshenbaum A.S. Goff J.P. Semere T. Foster B. Scott L.M. Metcalfe D.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with anti-p72syk. Alternatively, identically loaded membranes were probed for normalization. For translocation experiments, protein equivalents were established by probing the membrane extracts with anti-Kit (CD117) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and/or heat shock protein (HSP)90 (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA). Kit was used as a marker for membrane proteins and HSP90 as a marker for the presence of cytosolic proteins in the membrane fraction. Although, in some experiments, HSP90 was detected in the membrane fraction, this was generally a minor component of total cellular protein and was unaffected by antigen challenge. To quantitate changes in protein phosphorylation, the ECL films were scanned using an ImageQuant 5.0 scanner (Amersham Biosciences). GST Fusion Protein Capture Studies—HuMCs were stimulated and processed as for immunoprecipitation studies. After 2 min of challenge with NP-BSA (100 ng/ml), boiling lysis buffer was added to the cells and processed as above. The supernatants were diluted 10× in Tris-buffered saline containing Triton X-100 (0.1%) and protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and precleared with GST-agarose for 1 h at room temperature under rotation. After centrifugation, the supernatants were removed and incubated with 10 μg of agarose beads-GST-SH2-SH2 domains of PLCγ1 or the GST-SH3 domain of PLCγ1 (Santa Cruz) for 2 h at room temperature under rotation. The beads were washed 3× with Triton X-100 (0.1% in Tris-buffered saline) and the proteins were solubilized and separated by electrophoresis as above. The samples were then probed with anti-Vav, anti-SLP76 (UBI), and anti-LAT (gift from Larry Samelson, NCI, National Institutes of Health) antibodies. Fusion proteins alone were also run on the gels as controls for nonspecific binding of the primary and secondary antibodies. IP3Assay—Cellular IP3 concentrations were determined utilizing a commercially available kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturers instructions. Briefly, following cell activation, cells were extracted with trichloroacetic acid on ice for 15 min. IP3 was then extracted from the trichloroacetic acid precipitate using 1,1,2-trichlorofluorethane-trioctylamine. The IP3 containing fractions were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with membrane fractions of calf cerebellum containing the IP3 receptor and tracer d-myo-[H3]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The mixtures were then centrifuged at 3700 × g for 10 min and the tracer remaining bound to the membranes was measured with a β-scintillation counter. The results were expressed as picomoles of IP3 per 106 cells. Calcium Measurements—HuMCs and BMMCs were sensitized as above and then re-suspended in HEPES buffer containing 0.04% BSA, 0.3 mm sulfinapyrazole, and 0.5 μm Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were then incubated for 30 min, washed twice in the same buffer (without Fura-2 AME), and plated in black 96-well plates (Packard Biosciences, Meriden CT; CulturPlate™ -96F) at a density of 10,000 cells/100 μl/well. An additional aliquot of cells was treated similarly, except that Fura-2 AM was omitted from the protocol (non-loaded cells) and plated alongside Fura-2-loaded cells. Fluorescence was determined at 510 nm with alternating excitation at 340 and 380 nm in the Wallac Victor2 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The instrument was set at 37 °C and a top reading mode. After subtraction of background fluorescence of non-loaded cells, data were calculated as the ratio of fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths. Degranulation Experiments—Degranulation was monitored by determining the release of β-hexosaminidase as described (16Chaves-Dias C. Hundley T.R. Gilfillan A.M. Kirshenbaum A.S. Cunha-Melo J.R. Metcalfe D.D. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6647-6656Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, HuMCs or BMMCs were sensitized overnight as above. Following rinsing with HEPES buffer (17Lin P. Fung S.J. Chen T. Repetto B. Huang K.S. Gilfillan A.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) containing BSA (0.04%), HuMCs were suspended in the same buffer at 50,000 cells/ml, then triggered by the addition of NP-BSA in a 100-μl total volume. BMMCs were suspended at a concentration of 1 million cells/ml and then triggered in a volume of 200 μl. When the effects of inhibitors were examined, these compounds (or carrier buffer for controls) were added 10 min prior to the addition of NP-BSA. The experiments were terminated by centrifugation at 4 °C and then aliquots of the supernatants were removed for β-hexosaminidase assay. The remaining cells were lysed by the addition of distilled water and freeze-thawing. The β-hexosaminidase content of the supernatants and cell lysates was then determined as described and the release calculated as the % of total β-hexosaminidase (cells + supernatant) found in the supernatant. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-Trisphosphate (PIP3) Production—HuMCs were sensitized as above and then transferred to media without growth factors for 2 h. Following rinsing in HEPES buffer containing 0.04% BSA, the cells were loaded with [32P]orthophosphate (200 μCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h in the same buffer, rinsed, then 2.5–3 × 106 cells placed in 1.5-ml polyethylene tubes prior to stimulation for the indicated times with NP-BSA (100 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of wortmannin (100 nm). PIP3 production in HuMCs and BMMCs was subsequently measured as described in Ref. 18Manetz T.S. Gonzales-Espinosa C. Arudchandran R. Xirasagar S. Tybulewicz V. Rivera J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3763-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar. Expression and Activation of PLCγ —To first examine which isoforms of PLCγ were expressed in HuMCs, cell lysates were probed with anti-PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 antibodies. Extracts of other cell types known to express these isoforms were used as positive controls. As expected, the U937 cell line, mouse BMMCs, and RBL 2H3 cells expressed both PLCγ isoforms (Fig. 1a). Similarly both PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 were found in HuMCs. Having demonstrated that PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 were both expressed in HuMCs, we next determined whether aggregation of FcϵRI resulted in activation of these molecules as assessed by PLCγ translocation and phosphorylation, IP3 production, and intracellular calcium mobilization. HuMCs were sensitized overnight and activated by the addition of NP-BSA (15Tkaczyk C. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 268: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This resulted in a rapid translocation of both PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 to the mast cell plasma membrane, which was observed as early as 5 s after cell activation (Fig. 1b). Translocation of PLCγ2, however, was not as marked as the translocation of PLCγ1. We monitored PLCγ phosphorylation in HuMC lysates by probing with an activation state-specific anti-phospho-PLCγ1 antibody (Fig. 1c). There was little constitutive phosphorylation of PLCγ1 in resting HuMCs. However, FcϵRI aggregation induced a marked increase in phosphorylation of the active regulatory tyrosine residue of PLCγ1. This was followed by a noticeable, but incomplete, dephosphorylation by 120 s after FcϵRI aggregation. In these studies, no phosphorylation of PLCγ2 was observed in HuMCs, utilizing conditions (18Manetz T.S. Gonzales-Espinosa C. Arudchandran R. Xirasagar S. Tybulewicz V. Rivera J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3763-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) under which PLCγ2 phosphorylation was observed in mouse BMMCs (data not shown). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that PLCγ2 is activated in HuMCs following FcϵRI aggregation but is under the level of detection. We then confirmed the production of IP3, known to be PLCγ-dependent in HuMCs following FcϵRI aggregation. From Fig. 1d it can be seen that aggregation of FcϵRI resulted in a rapid increase in the production of IP3 that maximized between 10 and 20 s after FcϵRI aggregation. IP3 levels subsequently decreased but still remained elevated for up to 120 s. Finally, as before (19Okayama Y. Tkaczyk C. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we observed a rapid increase in intracellular free Ca2+ levels following FcϵRI aggregation (Fig. 1e). The initial increase closely followed the kinetics of PLCγ1 activation described above, however, levels continued to increase until 120 s after FcϵRI aggregation. This was followed by a slow decrease in levels. Interaction of PLCγ1with Adaptor Molecules—In activated T cells, PLCγ1 is recruited to the cell membrane in a PI 3-kinase-independent manner via the adaptor molecules LAT, SLP76, and Vav (reviewed in Ref. 7Wilde J.I. Watson S.P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To examine whether the activation of PLCγ1 in HuMCs following FcϵRI aggregation may also involve similar interactions, we examined the ability of the PLCγ1 SH3 domain and dual SH2 domains to bind to these molecules in extracts of activated HuMCs. Cells were stimulated for 120 s, then proteins were extracted under denaturing conditions. Following capture by the GST-SH3 domain and GST-SH2-SH2 fusion proteins, the samples were probed with antibodies to SLP76, Vav, and LAT. We observed no direct binding of PLCγ to LAT via the SH2 or SH3 domains under these conditions (data not shown) but we did observe an inducible binding of both SLP76 and Vav to the SH2 domains of PLCγ1 (Fig. 2a). Thus, in HuMCs, as in T cells, following cell activation, PLCγ1 is capable of directly associating with SLP76 and Vav. Expression and Activation of PI-3 Kinase—To next investigate the role of PI 3-kinase in the regulation of PLCγ activation leading to degranulation of HuMCs, we first examined the expression of PI 3-kinase in HuMCs. Lysates were probed for the α and β isoforms of the PI 3-kinase p85 subunit, and the α, β, and δ isoforms of the PI 3-kinase p110 subunit utilizing lysates of U937 cells, mouse BMMCs, and RBL 2H3 cells as positive controls (Fig. 3a). In HuMCs, the p85α and p85β and the p110α, -β, and -δ subunits (Fig. 3a) were all expressed. The anti-p85β antibody used in these studies did not recognize rodent p85β. However, expression of p85β in BMMCs has been confirmed utilizing an anti-p85 polyclonal antibody that recognizes both the α and β isoforms (data not shown). To establish that PI 3-kinase was activated in HuMCs following FcϵRI aggregation, HuMCs were sensitized and then loaded with [32P]orthophosphate prior to triggering as above. The formation of PI phosphates was then examined 2 min after FcϵRI aggregation. At this point, we observed a marked increase in PIP, PIP2 (Fig. 3b), and PIP3 (Fig. 3c) formation. As previously observed in mouse BMMCs (18Manetz T.S. Gonzales-Espinosa C. Arudchandran R. Xirasagar S. Tybulewicz V. Rivera J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3763-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), PIP3 was a relatively minor product compared with PIP and PIP2. These responses were blocked by preincubation of the cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, thus confirming PI 3-kinase activity following FcϵRI aggregation in HuMCs. To further support this conclusion, control and activated HuMC lysates were probed with antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of AKT and p70 S6 kinase, which have been utilized as markers for PI 3-kinase activity (20Kitamura J. Asai K. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Kikkawa U. Kawakami T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Li H.L. Davis W. Pure E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9812-9820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Following FcϵRI aggregation, as we previously described (19Okayama Y. Tkaczyk C. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), there was a marked increase in the phosphorylation of both AKT and p70 S6 kinase (Fig. 3, d and e). From Fig. 3d, it can be seen that wortmannin blocked the increase in phosphorylation of both AKT and p70 S6 kinase over a similar concentration range to that previously reported for the effect of wortmannin on PI 3-kinase-dependent responses (6Barker S.A. Caldwell K.K. Pfeiffer J.R. Wilson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 6: 1145-1158Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Okayama Y. Tkaczyk C. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Hiller G. Sundler R. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Taken together, the above data demonstrate that both PLCγ and PI 3-kinase are activated following FcϵRI aggregation in HuMCs. Relative Kinetics of the Activation of Src Kinases, PLCγ1, and PI 3-Kinase following FcϵRI Aggregation—To determine the sequence of activation events after aggregation, and the relationship between the activation of PI 3-kinase and PLCγ, we next examined the temporal relationships between the FcϵRI-dependent phosphorylation of PLCγ, and phosphorylation of AKT and p70 S6 kinase, and compared these kinetics to those of the activation of src kinases that represents one of the earliest FcϵRI-induced signaling events in mast cells. Following FcϵRI aggregation, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of both PLCγ1 and, as expected, src kinase was very rapid, maximizing within 5 to 10 s (Fig. 4a). In contrast, the kinetics of phosphorylation of AKT and p70 S6 kinase, whereas virtually coincidental, was not apparent until ∼30 s after FcϵRI aggregation (Fig. 4b). Thus, PI 3-kinase-dependent responses, as monitored by the phosphorylation of AKT and p70 S6 kinase, were delayed (Fig. 4c), appearing after the activation of PLCγ. These data are consistent with the conclusion that PLCγ activation is coincidental with the activation of src kinases but precedes the activation of PI 3-kinase. The Effect of Src Kinase, p72syk, and PI 3-Kinase Inhibitors on FcϵRI-mediated Protein Phosphorylation and PLCγ Activation—The above data suggest that PLCγ activation is independent of PI 3-kinase but may be regulated by src kinase(s). To verify this conclusion, inhibitors of src kinases, p72syk, and PI 3-kinase, respectively, PP2, piceatannol, and wortmannin, were next employed. We first examined the effect of PP2 on the phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and AKT. These responses were completely blocked in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5a) suggesting that the activation of both PLCγ1 and PI 3-kinase is dependent on src kinases. Src kinase(s) are known to regulate signaling events in activated mast cells in part through p72syk (23Benhamou M. Stephan V. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7310-7314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yamashita T. Mao S.Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 19. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To, therefore, determine whether the regulation of PLCγ activation by src kinases required p72syk activation, we next examined the ability of piceatannol to block FcϵRI-dependent PLCγ activation. The phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and AKT observed following FcϵRI aggregation was again completely inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by piceatannol (Fig. 5b). These data are consistent with the conclusion that both src kinases and p72syk activation precedes PLCγ phosphorylation. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, PLCγ activation also requires membrane translocation. We, thus, next examined the relative abilities of PP2 and piceatannol to prevent the FcϵRI-dependent membrane translocation of PLCγ and PLCγ-dependent IP3 production. Both PP2 and piceatannol blocked the membrane translocation of PLCγ (Fig. 5c) and IP3 production (Fig. 5d) following FcϵRI aggregation, indicating that these responses are also dependent on both src kinases and p72syk activation. Last, and following the data presented in Fig. 3 that shows that PI 3-kinase acti"

The NMDA receptor complex from the mouse brain was successfully solubilized with deoxycholate and immunopurified with anti-PSD-95 or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Immunoblot analyses revealed that the predominantly tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the NMDA receptor complex are the NR2A/B subunits and a novel 120 kDa protein. Purification and microsequencing analysis showed that the 120 kDa protein is mouse PSD-93/Chapsyn-110. Recombinant PSD-93 was phosphorylated by Fyn in vitro, and Tyr-384 was identified as a major phosphorylation site. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-93 was greatly reduced in brain tissue from Fyn-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, an N-terminal palmitoylation signal of PSD-93 was found to be essential for its anchoring to the membrane, where Fyn is also localized. In COS7 cells, exogenously expressed PSD-93 was phosphorylated, dependent on its membrane localization. In addition, tyrosine-phosphorylated PSD-93 was able to bind to Csk, a negative regulator of Src family kinases, in vitro as well as in a brain lysate. These results suggest that PSD-93 serves as a membrane-anchored substrate of Fyn and plays a role in the regulation of Fyn-mediated modification of NMDA receptor function.

The post-synaptic density (PSD) 1The abbreviations used are: PSDpost-synaptic densityNMDAN-methyl-d-aspartatePVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideCTXcholera toxin B subunitGFPgreen fluorescent proteinODGn-octyl-β-d-glucosidePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidIPimmunoprecipitation. is an accumulation of opaque material on the cytoplasmic face of the postsynaptic membrane. The density represents the aggregation of neurotransmitter receptors and signaling proteins, which trigger neuronal excitation of the postsynaptic cells. Among the biochemical functions present in the PSD is tyrosine kinase activity, and it is known that neurotransmitter receptors, such as subunits of NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, and GABA receptors, are phosphorylated on tyrosine. Electrophysiological studies have shown that some tyrosine kinases can modulate the activities of post-synaptic ion channels (1Wang Y.T. Yu X.M. Salter M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1721-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 2Kohr G. Seeburg P.H. J Physiol. 1996; 492: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 3Yu X.M. Askalan R. Keil 2nd, G.J. Salter M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and tyrosine kinase signaling is required for synaptic plasticity (4O'Dell T.J. Kandel E.R. Grant S.G. Nature. 1991; 353: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Among the NMDA receptors, the NR2A and NR2B subunits have been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated. Candidates that may be responsible for this activity include the Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), because Src is co-precipitated with the NMDA receptor subunits (3Yu X.M. Askalan R. Keil 2nd, G.J. Salter M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and the association of the NMDA receptors with PSD-95 could cause promote tyrosine phosphorylation by Fyn (5Tezuka T. Umemori H. Akiyama T. Nakanishi S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Fyn knockout studies have indicated that this kinase is involved in the acquisition of long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 neuron, and in spatial learning (6Grant S.G.

Thus, SFKs are believed to play important roles in the regulation of post-synaptic ion channels, although the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. post-synaptic density N-methyl-d-aspartate polyvinylidene difluoride cholera toxin B subunit green fluorescent protein n-octyl-β-d-glucoside 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid immunoprecipitation. NMDA receptors are known to form a complex with the PSD protein, PSD-95 and its related proteins. PSD-95 is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family of proteins (MAGUKs), which have been found to be major structural components of the PSD. Several domains within PSD-95, including three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase-like domain, have been shown to interact with various membrane proteins and signaling molecules, including the NMDA receptors (8Kornau H.C.

In order to identify molecules involved in tyrosine kinase signaling and regulation of NMDA receptors, we here investigated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associated with the PSD-95/NMDA receptor complex. The PSD is described as a tightly packed protein complex, and its solubilization under stringent conditions often disrupts protein-protein interactions. However, previous studies showed that solubilization of PSD with deoxycholate did not disrupt the association of PSD-95 with the NMDA receptors (16Sprengel R. Suchanek B. Amico C. Brusa R. Burnashev N. Rozov A. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Paulsen O. Andersen P. Kim J.J. Thompson R.F. Sun W. Webster L.C. Grant S.G. Eilers J. Konnerth A. Li J. McNamara J.O. Seeburg P.H.

Using this procedure we investigated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with the PSD-95/NMDA receptor complex, and found a novel 120 kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein. The 120 kDa protein was subsequently identified as PSD-93/Chapsyn-110 (18Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S. Craven S.E. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), which is a member of the MAGUK family of proteins. Analysis of Fyn-catalyzed phosphorylation sites revealed that PSD-93 is phosphorylated at a site(s) present in an inserted sequence unique to PSD-93. It was also found that N-terminal cysteine residues of PSD-93 are essential for its membrane localization and phosphorylation. Furthermore, the tyrosine-phosphorylated PSD-93 was found to interact with Csk, a regulator kinase for SFKs, in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that PSD-93 serves as a membrane-anchored substrate for Fyn and plays a role in the regulation of Fyn-mediated modification of NMDA receptor function.

Anti-NR2A and anti-NR2B antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Mouse brains were lysed in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was used as the TNE lysate. Precipitates were further lysed in DOC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% sodium deoxycholate), and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was used as the DOC lysate. In place of DOC buffer, ODG buffer (2% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside in TNE buffer) or SDS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4) was occasionally used for extraction of proteins. In the case of SDS buffer, homogenates were diluted in 5 volumes of Triton buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4), and the supernatant was used. For immunoprecipitation, anti-NR1, anti-PSD-95, and anti-PSD-93 antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution, and PY20 was used at 1 μg/ml in the lysates. After adding antibodes, lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice, then protein A- or protein G-Sepharose was added and the sample was rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were collected by brief centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 1 min, and washed at least three times with TNE buffer. Immunoprecipitates or lysates were boiled in SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins in the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane under semidry conditions. The membrane was probed with antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection. For detection of PSD-95, PSD-93, or phosphotyrosine, anti-PSD-95, anti-PSD-93 antibody, or 4G10 was used at 1:2,000, 1:2,000, or 1:5,000 dilution, respectively. Double Co-immunoprecipitation—Protein extracts from both wild-type and PSD-95 mutant mouse forebrains were prepared as described (17Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 1% (w/v) deoxycholate. The first co-immunoprecipitation was done by adding 150 μg of a sheep anti-NR1 antibody to a 25-ml extract, incubation at 4 °C for 4 h, followed by an addition of a 50% slurry of 300 μl of protein G-Sepharose and a further incubation at 4 °C for 8 h. Unbound material was removed by washing the resin in 50 ml of cold extraction buffer, and bound proteins were released from the resin by adding 300 μl of SDS-buffer containing 4% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 9.0, and boiling the whole sample for 30 min at 95 °C. The supernatant was then removed and 10-μl aliquots were diluted with 0.7 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, and 0.1 m NaCl. These samples were then used for a second immunoprecipitation using an antibody against either phosphotyrosine (2 μl) (anti-PY, RC-20 antibody from Upstate Biotechnology), anti-PSD-95 (4 μl) (Transduction Laboratories), anti-PSD-93 (4 μl) (APZ-002), anti-NR2A (1 μl) or anti-NR2B (1 μl). After an incubation for 3 h at 4 °C, 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose was added and incubated for a further 8 h at 4 °C. Unbound material was removed, and the resins were washed four times with 0.5 ml cold Nonidet P-40 buffer each, and bound material was released from the resin by boiling it in 30 μl of SDS buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Immunoprecipitates of PSD-95 or NR1 were washed once with kinase assay buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) and used as substrates. Recombinant proteins or immunoprecipitates were incubated with 10 ng of purified Fyn in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer with 50 μm cold ATP or 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. Kinase reactions were stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer, and the samples were applied to SDS-PAGE for detection of tyrosine phosphorylation by 4G10 immunoblot or autoradiography. In Fig. 5B, immunoprecipitated Fyn from the brain TNE lysate was used as a kinase source. After the kinase reaction, the reaction mixture was briefly centrifuged and supernatants containing substrate were recovered. Substrate proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with 4G10 to visualize tyrosine phosphorylation in only the substrate proteins. Treatment of Immunoprecipitates with Endo F or BAP—For Endo (endoglycosidase) F treatment, immunoprecipitates were boiled for 1 min in 20 μl of Endo F digestion buffer (0.25 m sodium acetate, pH 6.1, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% SDS), and after cooling 1 μl of 20% Nonidet P-40 was added. Digestion was done with 3 units of Endo F (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at 37 °C. BAP (bacterial alkaline phosphatase) treatment was achieved by incubating immunoprecipitate with 1 unit of BAP (Takara) in 20 μl of BAP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2) for 2 h at 37 °C. Large Scale Preparation of pp120 —Mouse forebrains of postnatal, 3-week-old mice were lysed in TNE buffer and insoluble precipitate was recovered. Typically, 10 g (wet weight) of brain was lysed in 100 ml of TNE buffer. The precipitate was then lysed in 20 ml of SDS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4) to solubilize PSD fraction as much as possible. After obtaining cleared lysate, SDS extract was diluted with 5 volumes of Triton buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4). To 100 ml of lysate, 500 μg of PY20, and 1 ml of protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry) were added, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were precipitated. Precipitates were washed five times with TNE buffer. Peptide Microsequencing—After large scale immunoprecipitation by PY20, precipitated proteins were eluted with SDS buffer. An equal volume of acetone was added to eluate, and proteins were precipitated. The pellet was dissolved in SDS sample buffer and applied to SDS-PAGE, followed by semidry transfer to PVDF membrane. Protein bands were visualized by Ponceau S staining, cut out, and incubated with lysyl-endopeptidase at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were recovered from the PVDF membrane and individual peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC (C-18). Isolated peptides were further subjected to gas phase sequencing. Preparation of Recombinant PSD-93—For production of full-length PSD-93 protein in Escherichia coli, the whole open reading frame (ORF) of PSD-93 was PCR-amplified with the primers 5′-ggggcatgcatgttctttgcatgttattg-3′ (SphIf) and 5′-cccctcgagttataacttctcctttgagg-3′ (XhoIr), and the amplified fragment was cloned into the SphI and XhoI sites of pQE30, an N-terminal histidine-tagged expression vector. A full-length PSD-95 expression vector was also constructed from pQE30 in the same way. For fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST), BamHI- and EcoRI-tagged primer sets were designed for the individual regions indicated in Fig. 6C or in Fig. 10, and PCR-amplified fragments were cloned into the corresponding sites of the pGEX-4T3 or pGEX-6P1 vector. These vectors were introduced to the E. coli TG1 strain, and expression of recombinant proteins was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. His- or GST-tagged proteins were expressed as soluble forms, and were purified with Ni-NTA-agarose or glutathione-Sepharose, respectively, by standard procedures. Mutagenesis was achieved by nested PCR procedure. For example, mutation of Tyr-348 to phenylalanine was accomplished using a mutated Y348F reverse primer, 5′-cagtttattcacagtgctgaaaaca-3′, and a forward primer, 5′-aggcctccggaacctgttttcagca-3′. PCR products amplified by the SphIf and Y348F reverse primers and the XhoIr and F348 forward primers were combined and used as template for second PCR using the outside SphIf and XhoIr primers. The resultant PCR product containing the Y348F mutation was cloned into the pQE30 vector. After construction of these vectors, the sequence of the individual PCR fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Fig. 10Co-immunoprecipitation of PSD-93 with Csk from mouse brain lysates. TNE, ODG, and SDS lysates were prepared from mouse forebrain by sequential extraction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These lysates were either subjected directly to immunoblot analysis or used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Csk or anti-PSD-93 antibodies. A, the lysates (10 μg of protein per lane) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PY (4G10) antibody (right panel). Equivalent protein loadings were confirmed by Ponceau S staining (left panel). B, recovery of NR2B, PSD-93, Fyn, and Csk in the SDS lysate was observed by immunoblot analysis using anti-NR2B, anti-PSD-93 (APZ-002), anti-Fyn, or anti-Csk (C-20) antibodies. C, immunoprecipitation of PSD-93 and Csk and precipitation without antibody (negative control) were done from the ODG and the SDS lysates, and precipitates were subjected to the immunoblot analysis using anti-PSD-93 (APZ-002) or anti-PY (4G10) antibody. The size of PSD-93 and Cbp are indicated by arrowheads and asterisks, respectively. Representative blot is shown, and the results were reproducibly observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Construction of Mammalian Expression Vectors—The vector pEGFP-N1 was used for expression of the N-terminal regions of PSD-93, PSD-95, Fyn, and their mutants, fused to the green fluorescent protein tag at the C terminus. The N-terminal region of PSD-93 (amino acid 1–88, designated as PSD-93N), PSD-95 (1–57, PSD-95N) or Fyn (1–78, FynN) was PCR-amplified with the primers 5′-gggaattctgcaatgttctttgcatgttattg-3′ and 5′-ccggatccttgacataaggaatagtgtc-3′, 5′-gggaattccaacatggactgtctctgtatagt-3′ and 5′-ccggatccgttccattcacctgcaactc-3′ or 5′-gggaattcgataatgggctgtgtgcaatgtaa-3′ and 5′-ccggatccgttcctcctctcgtacgcaa-3′, respectively. To construct N-terminal cysteine to alanine mutants, primers 5′-gggaattctgcaatgttctttgcagcttatgctgcactc-3′ and 5′-ccggatccttgacataaggaatagtgtc-3′ or 5′-gggaattccaacatggacgctctcgctatagtg-3′ and 5′-ccggatccgttccattcacctgcaactc-3′ were used for PSD-93NCA or PSD-95NCA, respectively. Amplified fragments were digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and cloned into pEGFP-N1. Mammalian Cell Culture, Expression, and Detection of GFP Fusion Proteins—COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection, cells were transferred to gelatin-coated glass coverslips at 90% confluency. Plasmids based on the pEGFP-N1 vector were transfected with LipofectAMINE2000 by the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were cultured for 3 days after transfection, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were probed with biotinylated cholera toxin B subunit (CTX) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 1% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, then probed with Cy3-streptavidin at a 1:1,000 dilution with 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Localization of GFP fusion proteins and the CTX-bound GM1-rich membrane fraction were observed with confocal laser-scanning microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss). Pull-down Assay—GST-PSD-93(343–417) was first phosphorylated by Fyn as described above. Phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated GST fusion proteins (100 ng) were incubated in 200 μl TNE buffer containing 10 ng of purified Csk (22Ogawa A. Takayama Y. Sakai H. Chong K.T. Takeuchi S.

Then, GST fusion proteins were precipitated by adding glutathione-Sepharose beads. Precipitates were washed four times with TNE buffer, solubilized with SDS sample buffer, and applied to SDS-PAGE. Sequential Extraction of Mouse Forebrain Proteins—Mouse forebrain proteins were sequentially extracted as follows. A mouse brain was first lysed in 8 ml of TNE buffer, and the supernatant was recovered as the TNE lysate after centrifugation of 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was again lysed in 4 ml of ODG buffer, and the supernatant was recovered as the ODG lysate after centrifugation of 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was once again lysed with 0.66 ml of SDS buffer, and the homogenate was diluted into 3.34 ml Triton buffer. The SDS lysate was recovered as the supernatant after centrifugation of 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Detection of Tyrosine-phosphorylated Proteins Associated with the PSD-95/NMDA Receptor Complex—In order to identify tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that are functionally associated with the NMDA receptor complex, we first attempted to solubilize the PSD-95/NMDA receptor complex from the PSD fraction by the use of deoxycholate as suggested previously (16Sprengel R. Suchanek B. Amico C. Brusa R. Burnashev N. Rozov A. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Paulsen O. Andersen P. Kim J.J. Thompson R.F. Sun W. Webster L.C. Grant S.G. Eilers J. Konnerth A. Li J. McNamara J.O.

Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Mouse brain was lysed once with TNE buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and the insoluble fraction containing PSD was recovered by centrifugation. The precipitated PSD fraction was then solubilized with DOC buffer containing 1% deoxycholate. By this differential solubilization procedure, we found that a major portion of PSD-95 was solubilized in DOC buffer from adult mouse brain. We then investigated the expression of PSD-95 and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the PSD during brain development (Fig. 1A). In the newborn mouse brain, PSD-95 was detected only in the TNE fraction (Fig. 1A, stage (w) 0). One week after birth, PSD-95 was detected equally in the TNE and DOC fractions. From 2 weeks on, the majority of PSD-95 was detected in the DOC fraction. More dramatic changes were observed for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Following brain development, the total tyrosine-phosphorylated protein content decreased in the TNE fraction. In contrast, total tyrosine-phosphorylated protein content increased in the DOC fraction. These changes took place within 3 weeks after birth. A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with a mobility of ∼180 kDa, already known to contain NMDA receptor subunit NR2A/B, appeared at the 1 week stage in the DOC fraction and then dramatically increased during the next 2 weeks. In the DOC fraction, tyrosine-phosphorylated SFKs including Fyn were detected as strong 60-kDa bands at the newborn stage, and the signals gradually decreased, indicating that SFKs are associated with the PSD. The band corresponding to SFKs could be detected in the TNE fraction only at early stages. Next we conducted immunoprecipitation assays using anti-PSD-95 antibody to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associated with the PSD-95/NMDA receptor complex (Fig. 1B). Two major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, pp180 and pp120 were detected in the immunoprecipitates. It is well known that one of the major ligands for the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of PSD-95 is the 180-kDa NMDA receptor subunits NR2A/B (8Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar) and that these NR2 molecules are tyrosine-phosphorylated. Therefore, the identity of pp180 was likely to be NR2. On the other hand, there was no obvious candidate for the tyrosine-phosphorylated 120 kDa protein. Characterization of pp120 —We first tested whether pp120 was NR1, which is a major component of the NMDA receptor complex and has a molecular size of about 120 kDa. Since NR1 is characterized by glycosylation, we initially examined the glycosylation status of pp120. The pp120 was immunoprecipitated with anti-PSD-95 or anti-PY antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were treated with Endo F to remove N-glycosylation moieties. Endo F treatment produced a mobility shift of NR1 obtained by either immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A), but had no effect on the mobility of pp120 (Fig. 2B). Endo F treatment also caused a mobility shift of NR2 (Fig. 2B). When the gel was stained with silver, a reduction in the apparent molecular size of NR2 was observed, while there was no mobility shift in pp120 (Fig. 2C). These data clearly indicate that pp120 is not related to NR1. Furthermore, it became apparent that NR1 is a minor component of the 120-kDa band detected by silver staining. Treatment with phosphatase (BAP) reduced the apparent molecular size of pp120 to about 105 kDa (Fig. 2D) and diminished the reactivity of pp120 with anti-PY antibody (data not shown), confirming that pp120 is a phosphoprotein. Next we conducted an in vitro kinase assay using pp120 as the substrate. It is known that SFK Fyn is able to phosphorylate NR2 (23Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether Fyn would phosphorylate pp120 or not. The PSD-95/NMDA receptor complex was immunoprecipitated with either anti-NR1 or anti-PSD-95 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were incubated with Fyn and ATP. As shown in Fig. 2E, both NR2 and pp120 were phosphorylated in a Fyn-dependent manner. Like NR2, this result indicates that pp120 could serve as a substrate for Fyn, at least in vitro. Identification of pp120 as PSD-93—As shown in Fig. 2, we found that pp120 protein could be effectively recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-PY antibody. We thus performed a large scale immunopurification of pp120 with anti-PY antibody to obtain sufficient protein for microsequencing, as described in the “Experimental Procedures.” We succeeded in obtaining more than 10 pmol of pp120 (Fig. 3A). A broad band of pp120 was transferred onto a PVDF membrane and processed for peptide microsequencing. We first obtained a partial amino acid sequence of a peptide, “DGRLQVGDRLLMVNNYS,” that is completely identical to that of mouse PSD-93. We next subjected the other nine peptides to five cycles of sequencing reactions, and these sequences were all found to correspond to sequences in PSD-93 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we confirmed that pp120 was immunoprecipitated by anti-PSD-93 antibody (Figs. 8 and 10). Taken together, these findings show that pp120 is mouse PSD-93.Fig. 8Tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-93 in COS7 cells and in Fyn-deficient mouse brain.A, tyrosine phosphorylation of PSD-93 was detected in COS7"
